{"id": 7263, "submission_id": "10b59sn", "title": "AITA for telling my fiance's paternal family that our wedding is not a chance for their son and daughter in-law to play adoring parents?", "selftext": "My fiance Ashton had a rough childhood. The oldest of five, with four special needs siblings (all on the spectrum), parents who struggled and did not ever make him feel like he was as important as his siblings. It wasn't until he was 11 and someone got his (maternal) grandfather involved that he had someone who cared. The way Ash talks about it, his parents tried to meet his very basic needs but never prioritized him or sacrificed for him the way they did for others. \n\nExamples: His 10th birthday was the first one he was supposed to get a birthday party for. Three of his four siblings fell ill the day before, the non-ill sibling did not like to go outside the house, neither mom nor dad wanted to deal with three sick kids and one sn kid, so they cancelled the party and they never made up for it. His best friends parents offered to take him for the day so he could have fun and they turned them down. For dinner that night he got a bland meal suitable for people who were sick. No cake, no anything nice for him. It was never made up for either and they got mad at him for holding it against them. They wouldn't let him make a sandwich and told him he was being a brat.\n\nHe really wanted to move into the basement so he could have his own room, since he shared with his brothers and could not have too much stuff in case it set them off. The basement could be a bedroom and was safe. But his parents said no. They told him it wasn't fair to isolate him and how his brothers would miss him. So he spent 18 years in a room that had no personality, where he was woken up every night by his brothers who didn't sleep well, and was scolded for trying to move into the basement anyway.\n\nHis parents had the rule that one dinner was made, with elements that each kid could eat. Another could be made if more than one kid wanted something different. One parent would often make the sacrifice of just doing one dinner so one of his siblings could have what they wanted, but they never did the same for him so he could have his favorite dinner. He noticed every time his parents did it.\n\nWhen his grandpa stepped in a lot of arguments went down. Ash said his grandpa saved him. That he was so angry and felt so lost. His parents never changed. They said he was selfish to ask them to sacrifice for him sometimes, like they did all the time for his siblings. He's had nothing to do with them in years. I never actually met them.\n\nHis paternal family (grandparents and three uncles) I have met. The grandparents came to me about how his parents should be invited to the wedding and how I should make the effort to let them celebrate their son and share in his joy. They had already been told no by Ash. I had also told them no but they persisted so I told them I would not give them (Ash's parents) the chance to play doting parents when they have never been. They told me I only have Ash's side. I said I also have his grandpa's, who witnessed a lot. They then said I was being spiteful and mean.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673643325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b59sn/aita_for_telling_my_fiances_paternal_family_that/", "score": 863, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is allowed to not forgive them. And he is allowed to resent them.\n\nAnd I would tell those family members your fianc\u00e9 is the only one who decides if his parents are in his life or not. And that everyone who will say even one word to claim otherwise is disrespecting what your fianc\u00e9 went through, and that leads to be uninvited. And anyone claiming that is too harsh is in very thin ice and should think carefully about the very serious effects of child neglect before they argue further. If they do argue further, uninvite them.\n\nBecause if you don't take a clear stance, they will keep pushing this narrative every chance they get.", "NTA, they made their bed, and you are respecting your future husband's wishes to exclude his parents.

I pray to all that is holy my own son never has these kinds of feelings towards me.  \n\nSeriously, screw them for how they treated your fiance.  Everyone deserves to have even a little something nice on their birthday.  All it would take is a simple cupcake from the store, and he likely wouldn't have been as resentful; at least not for that particular instance.

The fact that they have come to you after your fianc\u00e9 already told them that he doesn't want his  parents to come there shows that the family still doesn't have his pack.

This is something that seems to be so common in families where there are children with disabilities and siblings who are more able - the child without disabilities gets little attention, is always expected to make sacrifices, and is just generally held to different standards. From a parent's point of view, you can understand why they might need to give more time and attention to the other child, but when you can't be bothered to meet any of their emotional needs and, more to the point, REFUSE TO LET OTHERS SUPPORT YOUR CHILD WHEN YOU CAN'T, you're just not a good parent. \n\nUnless his parents can meaningfully reckon with the damage that they caused, no way in hell should they be around.", "NTA:\n\n>They told me I only have Ash's side.\n\nGood! \n\nSorry you're dealing with this, weddings always stir up so much drama.

I would say to them that the groom's guest list is not up to you, but that you will support your husband with the choice he makes.\n\nI will say, that many neurodivergent children, especially in a time with must fewer resources and support, was probably incredibly challenging.

Pressuring him into it would be emotionally manipulative and inviting them without his knowledge would be a divorce worthy breach of trust.", "Disinvite them. They don\u2019t deserve to be invited.\n\nNTA", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they don\u2019t show. They have a kid that doesn\u2019t like being outside, how are they going to get out? Guaranteed there will be a sibling excuse for a non attendance.", "They should come off that list", "I feel this soooooooo much. My parents weren't home when I got home from school on my 10th. I did not know where they were, and they did not get home until after 11pm. I cried from like dinner time until they got home. I shared a room with my brother and sister... even better, my bro and I were in twin beds while my 5 foot tall sister got a full bed. My bro was average height, I was 6 foot 4 at 14. My sister got the big bed so my brother wouldn't get jealous of me. So, I had to learn how to sleep my feet or legs hanging across an elevated wooden footboard. That's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n\n\nI certainly did not have to deal with the level of neglect that your fiance did, but that favoritism still hurts... and I'm 48... it also still exists. I am NC with my mother, and I don't know why I'm not with my father.", "Easy there Satan", "I am so lost. When did weddings start becoming about people that aren\u2019t the bride and groom? You\u2019re NTA, OP- I wish you and Ash the best.", ">They told me I only have Ash's side.\n\nYes, this is how partnership works. Why would you back your partners abusive parents instead of your partner?\n\nNTA, you need security at the wedding, and should reconsider inviting the family members who approached you. They may try to bring the parents either as plus ones, or just gatecrashers.\n\nEdit for punctuation.", "Disinvite them them as well. And cut them off.  Who needs that toxicity. Congratulations on your wedding!\n\nNTA", "100% nta.   I hope someday to meet someone who has my back half as much as you have his.", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t want them there end of conversation.", "NTA\n\nYou are being supportive and loving. The others never took Ash's side. They need to back off now. The parents are receiving the rewards they deserve.", "NTA- I'm glad Ash has you.", "NTA. His parents abused him. If anyone asks again about his parents, just tell them you don't intend to invite abusers to a celebration for you and your fiance.\n\nI think people often forget that the opposite of love is not hate, it's apathy. It can be soul crushing to be ignored, and that's what his parents did, they neglected and ignored him as a child.", "NTA at all the relatives who are whining are known as \u2018flying monkeys\u2019 trained and prepped by Ash\u2019s appalling parents.\n\nHi hope Ash\u2019s grandfather is in the wedding party.", "I thought the same before I got even three lines in.", "NTA. The parents dont deserves to share fiance's joy, none of which they gave during fiance's youth. OP is the second person to support and love after grandpa. Supporting your fiance is the best move. Its not like the future in-laws are going to become decent people anyway?\n\nJust promise to make it up to parents... in his old bedroom, with the siblings, with a bland meal", "op=NTA\n\nTo override Ash's decision would be to disrespect his choice.  That would be a poor start to your marriage.", "NTA. Be there for your man. Be his safe space. Too few have been. Congrats on your marriage.", "NTA.  You aren't being spiteful or mean, you're being loyal and supportive of your fiance, who was neglected and treated unfairly by his parents as a child, and doesn't want them at the wedding.  Stick with the grandfather, who sounds like a very good guy.  Ash needs less pain in his life, not more.  Sounds like he found the right woman to marry!", "The only thing that matters is having your husband\u2019s back. He has been no one\u2019s priority far too much. Support him. Back his choice. Be there for him. NTA", "NTA. Make sure you hire security to head off any attempt by the parents to gatecrash.", "Nta", "I call my \"parents\" the egg and sperm donors. The sperm donor left before I had memories and the egg donor gave me memories I've blocked out and still need therapy to process the ones I remember. They didn't earn the title of mom or dad. NC all the way. \n\nNTA", "Just say, \"I'm a spiteful and mean person.  Get used to it.\"\n\nNTA", ">They told me I only have Ash's side.\n\nIn your situation, this is where I would have blinked, looked astonished and said that of course I believed and supported the person I loved and was willing to marry and spend the rest of my life with.  Seriously what even is this statement?\n\nNTA.", "NTA - Ash doesn't them there.\n\nIt's that simple", "The four with SN they had one after the other. His mom was pregnant with the last one when their second child was diagnosed. Then the diagnosis came one after the other as well.", "We did! He's my fiance's guest of honor and he's officiating our wedding lol. Even if we had eloped, he would have been coming with us. We adore that man and he is essential to the day for us. I don't think I'd have Ash, or the Ash I know at least, without that amazing man.", "I think they might after this. But I will leave that for Ash to decide.", "Absolutely! He's actually officiating the wedding for us (he wanted to) and he's getting the exclusive of being the grooms guest of honor. We adore that man.", "That\u2019s great to hear and congratulations!"]}
