{"id": 7263, "submission_id": "10b59sn", "title": "AITA for telling my fiance's paternal family that our wedding is not a chance for their son and daughter in-law to play adoring parents?", "selftext": "My fiance Ashton had a rough childhood. The oldest of five, with four special needs siblings (all on the spectrum), parents who struggled and did not ever make him feel like he was as important as his siblings. It wasn't until he was 11 and someone got his (maternal) grandfather involved that he had someone who cared. The way Ash talks about it, his parents tried to meet his very basic needs but never prioritized him or sacrificed for him the way they did for others. \n\nExamples: His 10th birthday was the first one he was supposed to get a birthday party for. Three of his four siblings fell ill the day before, the non-ill sibling did not like to go outside the house, neither mom nor dad wanted to deal with three sick kids and one sn kid, so they cancelled the party and they never made up for it. His best friends parents offered to take him for the day so he could have fun and they turned them down. For dinner that night he got a bland meal suitable for people who were sick. No cake, no anything nice for him. It was never made up for either and they got mad at him for holding it against them. They wouldn't let him make a sandwich and told him he was being a brat.\n\nHe really wanted to move into the basement so he could have his own room, since he shared with his brothers and could not have too much stuff in case it set them off. The basement could be a bedroom and was safe. But his parents said no. They told him it wasn't fair to isolate him and how his brothers would miss him. So he spent 18 years in a room that had no personality, where he was woken up every night by his brothers who didn't sleep well, and was scolded for trying to move into the basement anyway.\n\nHis parents had the rule that one dinner was made, with elements that each kid could eat. Another could be made if more than one kid wanted something different. One parent would often make the sacrifice of just doing one dinner so one of his siblings could have what they wanted, but they never did the same for him so he could have his favorite dinner. He noticed every time his parents did it.\n\nWhen his grandpa stepped in a lot of arguments went down. Ash said his grandpa saved him. That he was so angry and felt so lost. His parents never changed. They said he was selfish to ask them to sacrifice for him sometimes, like they did all the time for his siblings. He's had nothing to do with them in years. I never actually met them.\n\nHis paternal family (grandparents and three uncles) I have met. The grandparents came to me about how his parents should be invited to the wedding and how I should make the effort to let them celebrate their son and share in his joy. They had already been told no by Ash. I had also told them no but they persisted so I told them I would not give them (Ash's parents) the chance to play doting parents when they have never been. They told me I only have Ash's side. I said I also have his grandpa's, who witnessed a lot. They then said I was being spiteful and mean.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673643325, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b59sn/aita_for_telling_my_fiances_paternal_family_that/", "score": 228, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he doesn\u2019t want them there, they shouldn\u2019t be there. You\u2019re paying for the wedding and the day is about you two, not his parents.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate but understandable that he doesn\u2019t want them around.

You're exactly right about them wanting to play the part of proud, devoted parents (and grab some attention), and gosh but that makes me furious on Ash's behalf. You're doing the right thing--stick to your guns and don't invite people who don't deserve to share in Ash's special day.", "NTA, and of course you have Ash's side.", "NTA. Your fiance and yourself are in agreement. His paternal grandparents and uncles don't have any right to dictate who comes to your wedding.", "NTA. Ash made the decision. Of course you would have his side. Explain to the paternal side that it is not wise to start off a marriage with going behind your spouses back.", "NTA, this is a day for you and your fiance.

Good for you for standing up for your fiance. They absolutely should not attend the wedding. Not only were they not really parents to your fiance much to begin with, a wedding is the LAST PLACE to force a family reunion.\n\nIf your fiance ever wants to mend his relationship with his parents, it needs to be his decision and on his terms. I'd go no/low contact with anyone who refuses to support his boundaries on this matter.", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules.\n\nAlso, after years of neglect your fianc\u00e9 is allowed to be spiteful. He is allowed to not forgive them. And he is allowed to resent them.\n\nAnd I would tell those family members your fianc\u00e9 is the only one who decides if his parents are in his life or not. And that everyone who will say even one word to claim otherwise is disrespecting what your fianc\u00e9 went through, and that leads to be uninvited. And anyone claiming that is too harsh is in very thin ice and should think carefully about the very serious effects of child neglect before they argue further. If they do argue further, uninvite them.\n\nBecause if you don't take a clear stance, they will keep pushing this narrative every chance they get.", "NTA, they made their bed, and you are respecting your future husband's wishes to exclude his parents.  The only AHs in this story are his mom and dad, who clearly didn't have an issue with alienating one of their children in favor of the others.  \n\nThis kinda thing really makes me sick.  I pray to all that is holy my own son never has these kinds of feelings towards me.  \n\nSeriously, screw them for how they treated your fiance.  Everyone deserves to have even a little something nice on their birthday.  All it would take is a simple cupcake from the store, and he likely wouldn't have been as resentful; at least not for that particular instance.  It's one thing to have to pay extra attention to the medical and emotional needs of your children, but that doesn't give you permission to neglect another child in favor of the others.", "NTA\n\n>  The grandparents came to me about how his parents should be invited to the wedding and how I should make the effort to let them celebrate their son and share in his joy. \n\nTell his paternal family that they should know better than to even ask.   \n\nIt's your (as a couple) wedding, you get to limit the guest list how ever you like.   \n\nHis parents chose to sacrifice Ash's childhood by prioritizing their other children and they do not deserve to come to his wedding.\n\nAlso, consider rescinding the invitation of anyone who pushes further and having security preventing his parents from attending and bringing all his siblings.", "NTA\n\nTell the relatives it's Ash's decision to make, since it's his family.

As far as Ash's grandparents, that is a conversation that Ash needs to have with them.", "NTA\n\nAsh is soon to be your husband, so you should have his side, just like his parents and grandparents should have done. The fact that they have come to you after your fianc\u00e9 already told them that he doesn't want his  parents to come there shows that the family still doesn't have his pack. Children should never have to be burdened to be the one who extends the olive branch to their parents. \n\nDon't let anyone manipulate you into shifting your boundaries to make them feel better.", "NTA  who cares what those people think.", "...like that family has any say in your wedding plans. NTA.", "Absolutely NTA. This is something that seems to be so common in families where there are children with disabilities and siblings who are more able - the child without disabilities gets little attention, is always expected to make sacrifices, and is just generally held to different standards. From a parent's point of view, you can understand why they might need to give more time and attention to the other child, but when you can't be bothered to meet any of their emotional needs and, more to the point, REFUSE TO LET OTHERS SUPPORT YOUR CHILD WHEN YOU CAN'T, you're just not a good parent. \n\nUnless his parents can meaningfully reckon with the damage that they caused, no way in hell should they be around.", "NTA:\n\n>They told me I only have Ash's side.\n\nGood! \n\nSorry you're dealing with this, weddings always stir up so much drama. Keep standing by your fiance. Congratulations!", "Absolutely NTA\n\nAnd frankly, if they continue to push it, they should not be invited either.\n\nThey don't get to excuse and force a relationship with toxic abusers especially when they've been told NO previously", "NTA.  I would say to them that the groom's guest list is not up to you, but that you will support your husband with the choice he makes.\n\nI will say, that many neurodivergent children, especially in a time with must fewer resources and support, was probably incredibly challenging.
