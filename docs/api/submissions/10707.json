But a lot of people in our family love seafood so the fish option was chosen more than the meat option.\n\nMy younger brother (20M) contacted me about a week before the dinner to RSVP and ask if he can bring a plus one, his new girlfriend. He chose meat option.\n\nNow my brother dates around a lot and is always bringing new girls around, so I wasn't aware that he was even in a relationship. I told him sure and that I'd have an extra seat for her. \n\nNight of the dinner comes, everyone is having a good time, I met my brothers new gf, she seemed very sweet. \n\nWhen it came time to eat she pulled one of the waiters aside and LOUDLY asked him \"is there any vegan options?\"\n\nThe waiter looked confused and said \"we have a fish and a meat option for the mains. I can offer you a salad and some roasted potatoes and other veggies as a substitute if you wish\".\n\nBrothers gf started get mouthy with him and said \"well what if I don't want a salad huh? You just assume because I'm vegan I only eat salads? What if I want some pasta? What kind of restaurant is this, this is discrimination\". \n\nMy brother started trying to calm her down, but she started going off on ME saying how \"why would you pick a restaurant that doesn't have vegan options? MANY people are vegan nowadays it makes me feel alienated that you couldn't even think to accommodate me\".\n\nI explained to her that the only people that have food restrictions here are pescatarians, so that's what I considered when I chose the restaurant. I didn't even know she was coming until a week ago, the reservation had been booked a month ago.\n\nShe started saying it's embarrassing on my part that I can't accommodate all my guests, and called me \"small-minded\" I told her \"sorry I didn't think to accommodate you I'll consider that in the future, hopefully you'll be around long enough for me to do able to do so\". \n\nShe ended up leaving. My brother walked out with her, and has been messaging me that I should apologize to her because I embarrassed her in front of everyone. I told him she embarrassed herself.

Who does she think she is to complain like that? The way she talked to the waiter proves that she has no manners and the way she talked to you tells me that she is rude, spoiled and brat.

Your brother is TA for taking her side and she is THE TA here.", "Tell your brothet you'll apologize to her when she apoligizes to the waiter and the restaurant owners for the bad publicity she has done, and to the other guests in the restaurant for the inconvenience she caused them during their nice evening out.... and to you for messing with your special moment.\nNta", "NTA The girlfriend was rude and entitled. She tried to make herself the center of attention at your engagement party. \n\nSince it wasn't a well-established relationship (for which you would have known that she existed and she's vegan), your brother should have taken the initiative to check on the food situation and worked with you beforehand to arrange a vegan meal for her. This was an event with a limited menu and your brother knew it. \n\nYou chose the menu options based on the needs of the people you invited. Since she was a late addition who you graciously allowed your brother to bring, there was no way you could have known about this issue unless your brother told you. A lack of planning on your brother's part is the root cause of this. \n\nShe should have been happy she was allowed to attend. You were a bit salty but I don't think out of line in response to her bad behavior.", "NTA But wow oh wow, but your brothers GF is. You should remind your brother your world does not revolve around his current or future girlfriends. The audacity of her, invited to a nice restaurant by people she barely knows and gets that entitled. This is why vegans have a bad reputation.", "NTA.\n\nEverybody was given two clear options BEFORE the dinner took place: a meat one and a fish one. Your brother's girlfriend should have communicated her concerns beforehand and not act crazy entitled in the restaurant and embarass you.\n\nWhile I'm not vegan or anything along these lines, I have a few food allergies. While this makes me feel a little uncomfortable in public restaurants because I can't pick the same stuff as my friends, I don't complain about it, nor am I THAT mad about it.\n\nThey failed to inform you about her being vegan. That's their fault.", "NTA She is super entitled", "NTA \n\nShe was rude and entitled. And it sounded like even when your brother rsvp\u2019d he didn\u2019t tell you she was vegan. You\u2019re not a mind reader, and had he told you then you could\u2019ve probably called the restaurant to ask about options.

Lol\n\n>I'll consider that in the future, hopefully you'll be around long enough for me to do able to do so\n\nSecond, if you are being asked to apologize for her embarrassing behaviour and not having vegan option, then, by the same token, shouldn't her parents (or whoever raised her) be apologizing to you for bringing up such an entitled brat who feels like it is completely acceptable to make someone else's engagement party about themselves? Seriously, how is it your responsibility, or theirs, when she chose to act this way?\n\nThird, NTA.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT! :)", "NTA. Your brother though is just as much of a ah as she is. Did he not know that his new girlfriend was vegan? Did he not even think to mention it?

I would\u2019ve told her to leave immediately after that. Embarassing on her and your brothers part. You have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA. Your brother should have mentioned that she was vegan. You accommodated the pescatarians you knew were coming so it sounds like you'd have accommodated her too had you known. This is on your brother. Both for not telling you and for dating a girl who would cause such a major scene. Especially at someone's engagement dinner.", "You didn't make her feel alienated.\nA heads up from your brother would have been nice. \n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA. You don\u2019t go to an event like that expecting to be catered to. She should have graciously accepted the salad/roasted potatoes/vegetable option.

I\u2019m really sorry that she ruined your special night!", "This is really on your brother.  \nHe invited her: his job to make sure there was a main dish option she could eat.\n\nA restaurant can generally cope with an off-menu request if given a day or two's notice.  \n\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA. She embarresed herself with her bad attitude. She is AH for being an entitled vegan. Hopefully brother will see through her and end it.", ">My younger brother (20M) contacted me about a week before the dinner to RSVP and ask if he can bring a plus one, his new girlfriend.

What kind of restaurant is this, this is discrimination\".\n\nOf course, the desire to accommodate so obnoxious a person would be low to begin with...\n\n>My brother started trying to calm her down, but she started going off on ME saying how \"why would you pick a restaurant that doesn't have vegan options?

Your brother chose the meat option and didn't tell you. If you had known and had the time I'm sure the restaurant would have put together a vegan plate.\n\nAlso she sucks big time. There would be no apology from me.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked about dietary restrictions preferences prior to selecting the menu. The menu was set before your brother asked to bring his new gf. It was on him to check the menu and see if a vegan option was available *before he invited her*. His gf should have asked your brother the same *before deciding to attend*. \n\nBut no, instead the gf didn't bother and thought ght making a huge scene at a virtual stranger's engagement party was a good idea  it was not. The gf was incredibly rude and entitled. It is *not* discrimination to not have a vegan option available when there was a pre planned menu, and the restaurant did try to accommodate her \n\nYour brother and his gf owe you an apology for her obnoxious outburst. You owe them nothing.", "NTA\nIf she didn't bother informing you that she was vegan, how could you possibly know she couldn't eat the food at the restaurant?", "NTA\n\nDid anybody gripe that the meat or fish was the wrong type? Good heavens she sounds like an absolute nightmare. You handled it fine. The restaurant tried to accommodate her and she refused what they had to offer. She could have been polite, declined, and ate food elsewhere.\n\nReminds me of the dating, \u201chow do you know if somebody is vegan? Don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll tell you.\u201d", "Nta\n\n\nHer using the word 'discrimination', tells me all I need to know about her privilege. These people are so desperate to be oppressed", "NTA, but she sure is, and grating at that.", "NTA.  She was being dramatic for attention.  If you are lucky, she will feel alienated enough to avoid spending any extended time around you.  I feel bad for your brother, but hopefully he wakes up soon.", "Nta. Your brother chose the meat option. He set him self up for failure. He didn't let you know or ask if there was an option. You had no idea of knowing because you never had met her.", "Nta. She embarrassed herself and you. If your brother shared that info with you sooner, I\u2019m sure you would have asked the restaurant for an accommodation. \n\nAlso, if youre a polite human you don\u2019t make people feel bad at their party. You suck it up", "NTA and do not apologize. Instead sit your brother AND mother down and let them know you will not be apologizing and it\u2019s your brothers fault for not specifying that she is vegan. He didn\u2019t give you all the information up front and caused this issue. Also let them know that she will not be allowed at any other wedding activities until she apologizes for acting the way she did when none of that was your fault.", "Lmao NTA this sounds like an snl skit", "Yikes! So NTA. So don't apologize.", "NTA.  I also feel that you shouldn't apologize just for the sake of apologizing.  It was poor communication on your brothers part so he should be the one apologizing to both of you and in turn the girlfriend should apologize to you for her nasty behavior being this is the first time you all met her.  When she was told of the restaurant your engagement was at that was her chance to communicate with your brother about her vegan choices.  And if your boyfriend has different girlfriends what is the chance she will even be around for long.  I would stand my ground and be very firm with not apologizing.", "You are NTA. She sure is though...YOU did not embarrass her at your dinner - she did that all on her own.\n\nShe is a prime example of why people dislike vegans...", "NTA and brother just lost his plus one invite to the wedding.

It was his responsibility to ask about vegan options for her and HE dropped the ball. She should be mad at him! She\u2019s lucky you choose to include her, a week before the event!! There was absolutely no reason for her to act so childish and entitled like she did at someone else\u2019s party! And she was a guest of a guest! \n\nMost definitely NTA. Congratulations on your engagement!!", "nta \n\nYour brother knew that the options were meat and fish, this was his responsibility and he's trying to put the blame on you \n\nAlso this attitude is incredibly entitled. She was given a vegan option, she needs to grow up. A lot of people with allergies aren't even offered an option.", " NTA. She sounds entitled and your brother is a doofus. \n  How were you or the restaurant supposed to plan on a random vegan showing up? You had two meal options that worked for everyone who was originally invited. She has a right to be upset with your brother but not the waitstaff or you.", "If you didn\u2019t know she was vegan then definitely NTA.

Hopefully your brother moves on from her soon.", "NTA You didn't know that girl, so how can you alienate her?", "NTA\n\nA week's notice is too short to change the options for something like this.  She was informed before hand.\n\nIf she didn't like the options, she didn't have to eat, or she could have just left (which thankfully she did).\n\nShe doesn't get to demand that everyone accomodate her at a moment's notice. \n\nYou have no need to apologize to her.  She needs to apologize to you for making a scene.", "Nope. This is why vegans have a bad name. No one should act like this.", "Nta, and don\u2019t invite the new gf for your wedding. you want to celebrate it with people you know and like, not entitled girlfriends of the week.", "Nta. Your brother fucked up by not telling you when he rsvped, and she's obnoxious for making a scene", "NTA. You can\u2019t accommodate something you aren\u2019t told about. And why would your brother want to continue dating someone so rude and nasty? I\u2019d drop someone for being that rude to a waiter.", "NTA, I didn't know people were supposed to be psychic about past minute invites and their dietary preferences.

This is the fault of your brother and his GF.", "Nta. It's not about the vegan. She's being the stereotype of asshole vegans.", "You're NTA but your brother sure is TA for not thinking to mention to you that this extra head he was getting invited to the meal he already knew the menu of was going to want something other than the menu offered. What the hell was he thinking.", "NTA\n\nShe was a last minute addition and you were given no notice of her dietary preferences.

You do not owe her any type of apology.", "NTA- This is just silly but funny as I had this happen years ago we went to a steak house with a bunch of friends and one of them brought a vegan date,..She tried the same thing and I pointed out she is not even part of are group and is a guest for the first time and the last.", "NTA you're brothers new girlfriend is a piece of work, how were you to know she is vegan?? Nobody told you. Also you were a lot nicer than I would of been if someone spoke to me like that after only just meeting me she would of been marched out that restaurant the minute she disrespected me.", "WHAT. That is so rude. NTA. You were kind enough to invite her, and she basically threw it back in your face. Bet she\u2019s one of these vegans:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/4MG29je-MW4", "NTA X 10. I was vegan for a long time and these are are the vegans that give us a bad rep. Ugh.\n\nIf it were me, I would have taken the salad and potatoes. It's a free meal, after all. And who knows if their pasta is egg-free? If I wanted pasta, I would have researched the restaurant ahead of time and perhaps ordered separately or paid for my own dish. The world doesn't revolve around you and your choices when you become vegan.", "NTa. I would have kicked out the second she started with the waiter. No one has to accommodate someone being vegetarian or vegan.", "Accommodate her? You don't even know her. And your brother is a damn fool. He saw the RSVP. He saw the food choices. You would have to assume he knew she was vegan, cause god knows she sure seems the type to tell everyone about it.

Your brother owes you an apology for bringing such a shit show to your dinner. \n\nNTA", "NTA Apologize for what? She was offered a vegan option and chose to make an ass of herself. I'm a long time vegetarian and have eaten at many restaurants, if there's no vegetarian option I either order side dishes or if the place isn't super busy I ask POLITELY if I can adjust a meal. I've never had a place tell me no as it's always a simple fix. Your response was hilarious and your mother needs to mind her own business.", "NTA", "NTA - She is very entitled and obnoxious. The world does not need to cater to her.", "NTA.\n\nI'm vegan and if I'm being invited anywhere, I look up the menu beforehand. If they don't have anything I can eat, I eat beforehand. Yes it's awkward to explain why I'm not partaking, but I'm never rude about it.
