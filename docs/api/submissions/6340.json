I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to go with me, he said no. it was limited to only 25 people, so I went ahead and bought a ticket for just myself. the workshop is this weekend and my boyfriend wanted to go out Saturday, to which I reminded him that I had the workshop. my boyfriend decided that now he does want to go and has supposedly wanted to go this whole time. I told him to buy a ticket, to which we found out they\u2019re sold out. he then gets mad at me for not purchasing him one when I bought mine, but I reminded him he said he didn\u2019t want to go. he asked why on earth would he say that, obviously he wants to go. I said that he told me that he didn\u2019t need to go because he already knows everything there is to know about work (we have the same job). he says I\u2019m lying etc etc. \n\nhe then asks me to give him my ticket. at this point I\u2019m absolutely flabbergasted bc sir I paid $70 for this thing and asked you a gazillion times to come with me and you said no every time and now all of a sudden you wanna come? I said no. all hell breaks loose. he starts going off about how I don\u2019t support him, how I\u2019m stealing his job from him, how I have no need for this workshop and blah blah. I feel like if he cared so much, he should\u2019ve just bought his own ticket back when he found out about it?\n\nhe told me if I\u2019m gonna be so unreasonable he doesn\u2019t want to be with me anymore and that we should break up. \n\nTLDR: asked my boyfriend if he wanted to go to a workshop with me. he said no. week of workshop he decides he wanted to go the whole time and now that it\u2019s sold out I should give him my ticket.", "created_utc": 1672696433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101oxeq/aita_for_not_giving_my_boyfriend_my_ticket_for_a/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend sounds like a gaslighter.  I hope this is an isolated instance.", "NTA.  On top of a dozen other AH actions, he played the \"break up\" card.

Break up with him and outshine him at work.\n\nHe really does sound controlling and toxic.", "NTA\n\nYou planned in advance, you got yourself your ticket, you should use that ticket for yourself.\n\nBut this went beyond that. He accused you of not supporting him? Well, he's not supporting YOU to much more an extreme degree here.

He sounds manipulative AF. I would help him pack those bags and peace out. Enjoy your workshop!", "NTA. \n\nMaybe he's not a gaslighter on the whole but the \"I clearly want to go why would I have said I didn't. You are wrong so give me your ticket.\" is gaslighting.

He isn't worth it.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQuestion: do you want to be with someone who cares so little about you that he would walk away from you simply for not buying him a ticket to a workshop?\n\nHis behavior is textbook Narcissistic Personality Disorder: Believes he's superior/smarter than everyone else, gaslights you to make you question reality/your own sanity, an unrealistic demand (that is likely a test to see how much control he has over you), and unpredictable anger outburst/threat to break up with you if he doesn't get what he wants. \n\nI highly recommend you read up on NPD. These people get worse (not better) over time. The more you give in or try to change them, the more they manipulative/abuse you. His over the top, completely uncalled-for reaction is highly concerning. This is not how mentally healthy adults should behave.", "DANGER, WILL ROBINSON, DANGER!!!

This man is very manipulative and disgusting for threatening a break up because he\u2019s not getting his way.  You need to move on from this dude.
