I was judged NTA and some comments really helped me. A special thanks to u/ [Diligent\\_Neat8843](https://www.reddit.com/user/Diligent_Neat8843/).\n\nRegarding by friend A: I called her and apologised again for yelling and ruining her dinner party. She said that I did not ruin anything and that she should have put a stop to B's actions long ago. She also told me that I was paranoid as always and that I did not yell but just raised my voice a bit and that it was normal that the table next to us seemed invested in our discussion. I insisted on taking her out to dinner just the two of us after my exams and we went and had a great time. We are both in no contact with B and low contact with the other girls.\n\nRegarding my university problems: I contacted my teacher. He was as useful as always and told me that I should continue to do my work (meaning all the work) and that he would ask his superior for help. I did not hear back from him before my presentations.\n\nAt that point I was angry and bitter of all the work I had to do so I said \"screw them\" and signed everything with my name only and presented alone with my colleagues standing next to me completely silent. I repeated several times that I did everything alone and told my teacher that I sent him an email with proof of this (email, screenshots, etc.). He said he had not seen the mail yet. He asked the others if it was true that I did everything alone and three of them actually tried to lie AFTER I told the teacher I had proof! But the last one, I will call him Boy, said the truth, and apologised to both me and the teacher.\n\nBoy took me out to lunch after the presentation, apologised again and explained that he was \"like stuck in a mental coma\" after a traumatic event that occurred to him and that I \"snapped\" him \"right out of it\" when I told the teacher about all the work I had to do alone (his words). He told me that he was thinking about quitting his studies because he was so behind, but I managed to dissuade him and we now regularly meet up to study together. We have become good friends and he will be back on path with his studies in about a year hopefully.\n\nI passed all my exams but the colleagues failed all of them. The 3 other colleagues are currently facing some troubles with the university for fraud/cheating(?) since they continue to claim that they worked on the exams and will not back down with these statements. My teacher is confident that they will be expelled over their stubbornness. Boy is okay, as he admitted everything and \"just\" failed the exams.\n\nI can sleep again and I am happy. This is all, thank you all again!", "created_utc": 1682840670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133iy0r/update_for_aita_for_how_i_responded_to_a_friend/", "score": 187, "replies": ["Lovely to read your positive update.\nWishing you bestest for your future!", "This is a great update and I'm really proud of you for standing up for yourself at school and for learning the value of prioritizing friends who reciprocate care. \nYou handled all of this really well and I really hope that your workload becomes more reasonable as you continue to push back on those who may try to shirk their responsibilities. \n\nIn your OP you mentioned that you didn't know what happened but you felt like you just snapped. When you are sleep deprived your ability to regulate your emotions plummets. While I think your response to B was warranted, if you have any lingering regret I think you should give yourself a little more compassion and understand that your actions were very human.", "So glad to hear it all went well in the end!\n\nAnd fuck B. What an asshole.", "I'm glad things worked out and that your friend stood up for you to B. I never saw your first post but it sounds like you handled things alright, and that's awesome!", "I'm a late to the party!\n\nFirst, dinner story awesome! Some parents need reminding that we all go through times of no sleep.\n\nSecond, good on you for standing up for yourself!!! That would have been intense to stand there with everyone lying at first and to fight.\n\nThird, good to have a study buddy just don't get caught up with \"boy\" to much. Just incase he starts to slide again, remember your only reasonable for you OP", "I'm happy for you - it sounds like you had a lot on your plate! Glad to hear the positive update with university, and that you've dropped contact with B.", "Good for you.", "Congrats on surviving through your exams and having the persistence and focus to do hard things. \n\nAnd please take care of yourself. I know it feels like a lot and your whole life is dependent on this but your health and wellness matter. You can sustain 90 work weeks and no self care. You have an entire life ahead of you. So, give yourself a break and breathe.", "I'm glad to hear you are doing better.\n\nI'm a mother of 3 myself and constantly tired but while my eldest 2 are at school I still have my youngest at home most days, she goes to daycare 1 day a week to give me a break and a chance at some \"couples time\" with hubby, we usually run errands but it's nice because we don't get any time alone otherwise. \n\nI have no idea how B is always so tired if she has all 3 at daycare 5days and a live-in \"night nanny\" in her MIL. I agree with what the commenters said about her about her not liking the truth. Don't feel bad about calling her out, us parents don't have the monopoly on tiredness.\n\nKeep looking after yourself, sweetie. You have your whole life ahead of you so you ever get a schedule like that again, please make time to sleep, it will be better for you physically, mentally and emotionally."]}
