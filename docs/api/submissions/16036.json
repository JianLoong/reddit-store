I was judged NTA and some comments really helped me. A special thanks to u/[**Noiwontinstalltheapp**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Noiwontinstalltheapp/) .\n\nRegarding by friend A: I called her and apologised again for yelling and ruining her dinner party. She said that I did not ruin anything and that she should have put a stop to B's actions long ago. She also told me that I was paranoid as always and that I did not yell but just raised my voice a bit and that it was normal that the table next to us seemed invested in our discussion. I insisted on taking her out to dinner just the two of us after my exams and we went and had a great time. We are both in no contact with B and low contact with the other girls.\n\nRegarding my university problems: I contacted my teacher. He was as useful as always and told me that I should continue to do my work (meaning all the work) and that he would ask his superior for help. I did not hear back from him before my presentations.\n\nAt that point I was angry and bitter of all the work I had to do so I said \"screw them\" and signed everything with my name only and presented alone with my colleagues standing next to me completely silent. I repeated several times that I did everything alone and told my teacher that I sent him an email with proof of this (email, screenshots, etc.). He said he had not seen the mail yet. He asked the others if it was true that I did everything alone and three of them actually tried to lie AFTER I told the teacher I had proof! But the last one, I will call him Boy, said the truth, and apologised to both me and the teacher.\n\nBoy took me out to lunch after the presentation, apologised again and explained that he was \"like stuck in a mental coma\" after a traumatic event that occurred to him and that I \"snapped\" him \"right out of it\" when I told the teacher about all the work I had to do alone (his words). He told me that he was thinking about quitting his studies because he was so behind, but I managed to dissuade him and we now regularly meet up to study together. We have become good friends and he will be back on path with his studies in about a year hopefully.\n\nI passed all my exams but the colleagues failed all of them. The 3 other colleagues are currently facing some troubles with the university for fraud/cheating(?) since they continue to claim that they worked on the exams and will not back down with these statements. My teacher is confident that they will be expelled over their stubbornness. Boy is okay, as he admitted everything and \"just\" failed the exams.\n\nI can sleep again and I am happy. This is all, thank you all again!", "created_utc": 1682840670, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133iy0r/update_for_aita_for_how_i_responded_to_a_friend/", "score": 1858, "replies": ["Lovely to read your positive update.\nWishing you bestest for your future!", "This is a great update and I'm really proud of you for standing up for yourself at school and for learning the value of prioritizing friends who reciprocate care. \nYou handled all of this really well and I really hope that your workload becomes more reasonable as you continue to push back on those who may try to shirk their responsibilities. \n\nIn your OP you mentioned that you didn't know what happened but you felt like you just snapped. When you are sleep deprived your ability to regulate your emotions plummets. While I think your response to B was warranted, if you have any lingering regret I think you should give yourself a little more compassion and understand that your actions were very human.", "So glad to hear it all went well in the end!\n\nAnd fuck B. What an asshole.", "I'm glad things worked out and that your friend stood up for you to B. I never saw your first post but it sounds like you handled things alright, and that's awesome!", "I'm a late to the party!\n\nFirst, dinner story awesome! Some parents need reminding that we all go through times of no sleep.\n\nSecond, good on you for standing up for yourself!!! That would have been intense to stand there with everyone lying at first and to fight.\n\nThird, good to have a study buddy just don't get caught up with \"boy\" to much. Just incase he starts to slide again, remember your only reasonable for you OP", "I'm happy for you - it sounds like you had a lot on your plate! Glad to hear the positive update with university, and that you've dropped contact with B.", "Good for you.", "Congrats on surviving through your exams and having the persistence and focus to do hard things. \n\nAnd please take care of yourself. I know it feels like a lot and your whole life is dependent on this but your health and wellness matter. You can sustain 90 work weeks and no self care. You have an entire life ahead of you. So, give yourself a break and breathe.", "I'm glad to hear you are doing better.\n\nI'm a mother of 3 myself and constantly tired but while my eldest 2 are at school I still have my youngest at home most days, she goes to daycare 1 day a week to give me a break and a chance at some \"couples time\" with hubby, we usually run errands but it's nice because we don't get any time alone otherwise. \n\nI have no idea how B is always so tired if she has all 3 at daycare 5days and a live-in \"night nanny\" in her MIL. I agree with what the commenters said about her about her not liking the truth. Don't feel bad about calling her out, us parents don't have the monopoly on tiredness.\n\nKeep looking after yourself, sweetie. You have your whole life ahead of you so you ever get a schedule like that again, please make time to sleep, it will be better for you physically, mentally and emotionally.", "Did you just send a special thanks to yourself? \ud83d\ude02", "Congratulations on passing your exams and replacing a bad friend with another friend. More importantly, congratulations on being happy and being able to sleep again!", "I'm so glad to hear everything worked out.\n\nThe narrative of \"You don't know what tired is till you have a child\" is exactly as you stated.  \nIt is a selfish bratty privileged perspective to have.\n\nI have several chronic illnesses and have to attend heaps of medical appointments all year round but I apparently know nothing of exhaustion according to parents who have a full support system where I have myself. \n\nYour behaviour in regards to Boy just shows how NTA you are.", "Wow, lovely update! Toxic friends minimized, new accountable friends added, and course issues eased. Way to go!", "More importantly, congratulations on being happy and being able to sleep again!", "I cant get over number 3. OP you are amazing!\n\nIn the middle of all your stress and troubles you took the time to counsel this (basically a) stranger back on track?\n\nThat's just above and beyond, OP.", "You are totally right! I am really embaressed! I wrote the post two times and while copying it I must have written the wrong name. I did not notice until your comment, probably because I did not personally choose the name, it was suggested by reddit. I am gonna edit the post with the right redditor", "It was quite a humorous touch. Absolutely thank yourself! \u2764\ufe0f", "Read your original post and one thing stood out...\n\n<other friends said> *\" I was insensitive to her struggles and that it was not okay to bring her \"home situation\" to the discussion\"*\n\nDid they berate B for being insensitive your struggles?  Also, you did  not bring her \"home situation\" to  the discussion, she did when she said wait till you have children to understand.  Since she brought her \"home situation\" into the discussion and used it as the foundation for her insult to you about your struggles, she opened it to being fair game", "This is a great update, we\u2019ll done! I hope you are truly learning that you can\u2019t take paracetamol for other peoples headaches anymore. Do what you need to do and let others pass or fail on their own merits!", "\ud83d\udcaf agree", "Heck yeah! This is a good update :D", "Nice! I'm so glad you're feeling better.", "I love you took credit for your work. I felt social pressure to share my hard work and I hate the memory. \n\nAlso read your previous post. You are a rocking good friend. You didn\u2019t see that you gave A a great birthday present. You drove off B. Who by all accounts is exhausting and entitled. A terrible combo.", "University professors generally don't care about your exhaustion because they were exhausted students as well and just internalized that suffering as \"normal\", and anyone that complains is \"whining\", or \"lazy\". They then rationalize students quitting due to burnout as \"sifting the good students from the bad\".", "Oh, \ud83d\udcaf on the sleep deprivation and emotional regulation bit. I have fibromyalgia and even though I take meds to help regulate pain and help me sleep, if I get overtired, I can have a big meltdown. And it sucks to have happen.\n\nB was choosing to be snide and belittle you, OP. Add in the overtired/exhaustion, and you got the perfect mix for having a bad moment. I'm delighted A was both understanding and realizing just how toxic B was being. Cutting out the negative people will do you the best thing you can do.\n\nAnd full on cheering here, for you standing up for yourself and also for helping Boy with studying and staying in school. You've done both of you so much good!\n\nKeep doing great, and don't forget to take time for you to relax/unwind. Studies can be overwhelming at times, and taking just even a few hours away from them can do so much more good for you!", "Yes to your first point. I used to have this friend who did the whole \"You can't know what tired is until you have kids.\" One time, she asked me how I was doing, I told her I was tired. I was about to tell her about my health issues and she went on about parenthood. It's a big part of why we aren't friends anymore.", "You're an upstanding, outstanding, badass. This update is tremendous. Bonne chance to you in everything. You're a good and sensitive person.", "Awesome!", "The way her relationship with boy unfolded choked me up for a min, I don\u2019t know maybe I\u2019m extra emotional today, but it was really sweet", "Good for you.", "Wow--I did not see your original post(at the time) but I'm glad you worked things out with A. \n\nAnd that you made it through your exams(and it was very generous of you to help \"Boy\".).  I hope you go on to a happy graduation and a great job.", "A is a true friend, glad they aren't mad at you. Also that's some good karma there when the boy backed you up. Also congratulations on passing your exams and sleep :)", "So many parents on Reddit feeling abused by parenthood while also feeling uber virtuous for  having kids. What is it about such people having kids that makes such people need to be the star of every show.\n\nHad kids and new lots if other parents without seeing this attitude.  Wondering if the obnoxious parents just had kids because they felt obligated to or because it was the only time in life they accomplished anything of value.  May be your studies caused that mom to recognize the future ahead of you while she isn\u2019t is stagnating.  She has time, with all that child care help, to chase a personal ambition as you are doing.", "Just read your original along with the update. And wanted to say that while I was in uni, I was stressed with the work load, overwhelmed from undiagnosed ADHD and had insomnia. My sleep was terrible! When I got pregnant with my eldest the hormones helped me sleep better. When I had my newborn I was literally sleeping more and better quality sleep than I was before I got pregnant with her. It was a breeze compared to the sleeplessness I had during university! I also have 3 kids now and still think it's less tiring than how I was a uni.\nGood on you for cutting out the toxicity!", "Honestly, I feel like B needed that wake-up call. It's probably because all of you girls are studying/working while B is the only SAHM (who has the luxury of a daycare and supportive MIL) so I bet that she feels left out a lot when your conversations drift to your careers. I have the inkling that being a SAHM has become an integral part of her identity and without it she wouldn't have much left so she takes immense pride in that. So obviously, she has to gatekeep that identity because without it she wouldn't be anything compared to you girls who are working towards their future. She's only 22, she can still learn. I know a lot of 20 year olds who were not always the most mature adults (me, I'm talking about me). But it's not your job to help her realize that.\n\nJust my 2 cents about a person I have never met and only heard a specific situation about, lol. Feel free to ignore that. But so glad, that you passed and can sleep again! Congrats!", "I'm glad things worked out! *HUGS!*", "this is the best update i\u2019ve ever read. not only did you a) get rid of somebody who was always putting you down, you b) made a new friend and c) helped somebody else!! those are three huge accomplishments, and after everything you managed to think about others. that\u2019s incredible.", "the \"home situation\" statement was so funny to me. she doesn't have a home situation, she lives in the lap of luxury and complains about it", "same hat!", "Same here. I don't know him but I'm proud that he took accountability and chose to be honest & vulnerable. A lot of older people struggle with that, and he did it with a ton of pressure. I'm glad he's spared the fallout the rest are experiencing and that both he and OP have a friend in each other based on mutual respect."]}
