Things are going pretty well and we are getting along very nicely. Something happened though yesterday and I am not sure if I handled it correctly.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend asked if he could stay with me for a week, because his roommate has covid and he is trying to not catch it. Because I had it recently already, I agreed. However, when I went to the gym yesterday morning, I noticed that when I got back he turned the heating on! I couldn't help but got annoyed that he would just do such a thing without asking me first. I mean, it's not that I can not afford the energy bill, it is just that he is turning on something that costs me (another person) money.\n\nI get that my boyfriend gets cold quite quickly, but that doesn't mean he can just do whatever he wants and turn on the heating. I don't want him to pay for it or something, I just think it's polite to ask the home owner for permission before turning on the heating. If I were in his position, I would just grab a blanket until my boyfriend got home so I could ask if I can use his heating. Especially when gas prices are so high!\n\nAfter I told this all to my boyfriend, he seemed to get annoyed and replied with \"if you're so concerned about the costs, I can help with your energy bill\". He just totally misses the point, I don't care about the money... Since then we haven't been talking a lot and he seems to be in his own bubble. I don't know what to do?\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1668330452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytwbwk/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_should_not_turn/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, if he's comfortably at 26 but your apartment is 20 without the heat on, then the heat should be on.  And if  he's the one to turn it on, that is something you should be kicking yourself for.  That you were so inconsiderate that your guest had to do that... (when you should have)\n\nBut then there are some people who need the room to be very hot to be comfortable.

That\u2019s what I used to do in situations like this.", "YTA, a good host would ensure he was warm enough. Also if this was an issue for you perhaps you should have communicated that with him BEFOREHAND, so he would know it was out of bounds. I assume he's not telepathic?

In my area in the last 2 weeks there was an 80\u00b0 day so the ac was on. 2 days later the temperature plummeted and we got over an inch of snow. The house was still set to ac, so I woke up to the house temp being 40\u00b0. The heat got blasted as soon as I woke up. So I can see a house temp dropping below comfortable if the control isn't set just so. \n\nYou claim you don't care about the money, but are complaining your bf turned on the expensive heating. He was cold, and offered to help cover the cost to warm up. So you are complaining that he didn't ask you (when you were gone) to turn on the (expensive but you don't care) heat so he could be comfortable (when he could have huddled in a blanket)? Do I have that right?", "YTA If its not about money you are just being petty. Does he have to ask you to shower aswell?

He is your guest and your partner as well and you think it\u2019s ok to treat him this way. Very cold, especially when you can afford it and he offered to contribute. Learn to be kind and allow your guest to feel comfortable in your home. Things like heating, food and hygiene should not be policed. Apologise, explain that you didn\u2019t mean to make him uncomfortable and maybe agree for him to contribute something. Then he can eat, be warm and comfortable without feeling any guilt. And you won\u2019t have to worry about what he is using whilst he\u2019s staying.", "I feel like it might depend on the dynamic of your relationship, 1 year+ with someone could mean still dating or could be a very serious relationship. If y'all are still in the more dating like phase and not thinking about a future/living together etc. then I'm leaning towards NAH and voicing your concern is just setting boundaries. On the other hand if y'all are pretty serious then you could definitely be seen as acting slightly controlling with a soft YTA.", "YTA. You say tou don\u2019t care about the cost but you also said you were annoyed that he did something that costs you money.

That\u2019s not exactly normal from where I stand. I was so confused when I read your story, that I had to read it twice.

And he offered to help pay but you threw that idea away because it\u2019s all about \u201cpermission\u201d. You\u2019re acting like he read your diary or borrowed money without telling you he borrowed it. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a permission issue but you\u2019re on that reason so you don\u2019t get judged because it\u2019s about the extra cost on the bill. \n\nSo I\u2019m really curious if he had asked permission would you have said yes from the start or told him where the extra blankets are. Lol", "Hmmm I'd say YTA for how you handled it, but not for wanting him to ask first. \n\nIt was a first time occurance, you didn't have to get so confrontational.

That\u2019s just how I was brought up and it\u2019s a hard habit to break.\nTalk to him about it and just establish some ground rules.", "I\u2019m clearly going to be in the minority here, but I\u2019m going to say ESH. \n\nI\u2019ve been the homeowner with a guest who cranked the AC down without permission. They changed it to 65 while we were out for a few hours, **knowing** that we never crank it that low. It was infuriating, as you can actually send your AC to an early death doing something like that in a hot climate like where we live. He could\u2019ve turned on a fan. He could\u2019ve shot a text and asked if he could turn the AC down a little. It felt very strategic that he waited until we were out to turn our AC on. We\u2019d provided him with a personal tower fan and had let him know that we turned the AC down a little for him already when we noticed he was getting hot. Nobody was hot except for him.\n\nMost people have preset AC/heating temps. When I\u2019m the guest in someone\u2019s home, unless they give me permission to change the settings, I\u2019ll bring up being hot or cold and **ask** before I touch their temp settings. I do think that if OP\u2019s SO has been with her over a year, he knows that he probably gets cold in her place, and the right thing to do would be to ask her about turning the heat up before doing so. It feels passive aggressive to wait until she\u2019s gone to change the settings, and the reality is that it\u2019s not the same as a shower or a cup of coffee. It\u2019s changing the entire temperature of a space, essentially forcing someone else to be at that new temperature with you, regardless of their preferred comfort. The fact that it can be pricy to do so is also important. A shower won\u2019t set OP back significantly the way cranking the heat up for a week might.\n\nThat said, OP- if you\u2019ve been with your SO for over a year, you know that he gets cold. Communication was key here when you allowed him to stay. You should\u2019ve asked on the first day of his stay (before going anywhere) if he was feeling cold as you know he gets cold quickly, and immediately addressed the elephant in the room with something like, \u201cI know I prob keep the place a little colder than you\u2019re comfortable, as I\u2019m trying to save money on my utilities. If you feel too cold, let me know. We can try a sweater or blanket first, and if it\u2019s still too bad, we can talk about turning the heat up a bit.\u201d Instead, it sounds like you just left him to suffer in silence, assuming he\u2019d come find you if it got unbearable. That\u2019s not considerate. As a host, you should want your guests to be (reasonably) comfortable. \n\nYou both suck for not communicating before this got out of hand and for being passive aggressive with each other.", "You are right, you should ask the owner\u2019s permission, it\u2019s common decency.

I think you have a point because I didn't stop asking my bf if I can turn on the a/c in his room, and its been about 5 years. And if it's extremely hot, like in the summer, I'll turn it on for short bursts and just sweat it out despite how much I despise sweating.

Starting the heating is a pretty big deal, and especially this year. depending on the kind of heating system you have turning it on for a day or a few hours might not even be efficient or useful at all. I am trying to resist a couple more weeks myself with the help of blankets and tea. Besides it could be a month before you receive your bill so the offer to pay doesn't sound realistic. I agree that someone starting the heating (not just a space heater) in someone else's house is odd and I'd be pissed as well. NTA.", "NTA I find it rude too. It's the principle of the matter, not about monetary value. It's not in the same league as eating food or watching TV because those are normal and expected behaviors of a guest. Turning on heating or AC is not, maybe there is a reason she has it off? It's not his home, not his money and not his decision. Maybe it's because I come from a country where heating is not really a thing, but still, I would never just turn the heating on at someone else's home (even my boyfriend's) unless it was offered to me, or I asked first.", "I think you opened up the conversation without knowing what you wanted from him. Did you want him to apologize? Turn off the heat and then ask you if he could turn it on? I think this is one of life's little annoyances. It wasn't likely to repeat itself.

Things are going pretty well and we are getting along very nicely. Something happened though yesterday and I am not sure if I handled it correctly.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend asked if he could stay with me for a week, because his roommate has covid and he is trying to not catch it. Because I had it recently already, I agreed. However, when I went to the gym yesterday morning, I noticed that when I got back he turned the heating on! I couldn't help but got annoyed that he would just do such a thing without asking me first. I mean, it's not that I can not afford the energy bill, it is just that he is turning on something that costs me (another person) money.\n\nI get that my boyfriend gets cold quite quickly, but that doesn't mean he can just do whatever he wants and turn on the heating. I don't want him to pay for it or something, I just think it's polite to ask the home owner for permission before turning on the heating. If I were in his position, I would just grab a blanket until my boyfriend got home so I could ask if I can use his heating.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Agreed. This is super controlling behaviour.", "I guess he's not talking much, because he is asking himself those exact questions..and what he feels about it.", "This is it. \n\nIf someone turned on like whole house heating in my house when it's just a little chilly, for example, I'd be a bit wtf because to me it's so obviously expensive that I'd wonder why they think I'm made of money, and why they didn't think of that before they cranked the heating. \n\nBut I also know that not everyone is me and couldn't know if I didn't tell them, so it'd be a 'please don't do that in future', not 'how dare you do that without my permission'.", "I was more baffled that OP knows bf gets cold easily and didn't try to make his house comfortable before it became a problem.
