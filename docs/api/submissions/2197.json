Things are going pretty well and we are getting along very nicely. Something happened though yesterday and I am not sure if I handled it correctly.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend asked if he could stay with me for a week, because his roommate has covid and he is trying to not catch it. Because I had it recently already, I agreed. However, when I went to the gym yesterday morning, I noticed that when I got back he turned the heating on! I couldn't help but got annoyed that he would just do such a thing without asking me first. I mean, it's not that I can not afford the energy bill, it is just that he is turning on something that costs me (another person) money.\n\nI get that my boyfriend gets cold quite quickly, but that doesn't mean he can just do whatever he wants and turn on the heating. I don't want him to pay for it or something, I just think it's polite to ask the home owner for permission before turning on the heating. If I were in his position, I would just grab a blanket until my boyfriend got home so I could ask if I can use his heating. Especially when gas prices are so high!\n\nAfter I told this all to my boyfriend, he seemed to get annoyed and replied with \"if you're so concerned about the costs, I can help with your energy bill\". He just totally misses the point, I don't care about the money... Since then we haven't been talking a lot and he seems to be in his own bubble. I don't know what to do?\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1668330452, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytwbwk/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_should_not_turn/", "score": 1108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like, if he's comfortably at 26 but your apartment is 20 without the heat on, then the heat should be on.  And if  he's the one to turn it on, that is something you should be kicking yourself for.  That you were so inconsiderate that your guest had to do that... (when you should have)\n\nBut then there are some people who need the room to be very hot to be comfortable.

That\u2019s what I used to do in situations like this.", "YTA, a good host would ensure he was warm enough. Also if this was an issue for you perhaps you should have communicated that with him BEFOREHAND, so he would know it was out of bounds. I assume he's not telepathic?

In my area in the last 2 weeks there was an 80\u00b0 day so the ac was on. 2 days later the temperature plummeted and we got over an inch of snow. The house was still set to ac, so I woke up to the house temp being 40\u00b0. The heat got blasted as soon as I woke up. So I can see a house temp dropping below comfortable if the control isn't set just so. \n\nYou claim you don't care about the money, but are complaining your bf turned on the expensive heating. He was cold, and offered to help cover the cost to warm up. So you are complaining that he didn't ask you (when you were gone) to turn on the (expensive but you don't care) heat so he could be comfortable (when he could have huddled in a blanket)? Do I have that right?", "YTA If its not about money you are just being petty. Does he have to ask you to shower aswell?

He is your guest and your partner as well and you think it\u2019s ok to treat him this way. Very cold, especially when you can afford it and he offered to contribute. Learn to be kind and allow your guest to feel comfortable in your home. Things like heating, food and hygiene should not be policed. Apologise, explain that you didn\u2019t mean to make him uncomfortable and maybe agree for him to contribute something. Then he can eat, be warm and comfortable without feeling any guilt. And you won\u2019t have to worry about what he is using whilst he\u2019s staying.", "I feel like it might depend on the dynamic of your relationship, 1 year+ with someone could mean still dating or could be a very serious relationship. If y'all are still in the more dating like phase and not thinking about a future/living together etc. then I'm leaning towards NAH and voicing your concern is just setting boundaries. On the other hand if y'all are pretty serious then you could definitely be seen as acting slightly controlling with a soft YTA.", "YTA. You say tou don\u2019t care about the cost but you also said you were annoyed that he did something that costs you money.

That\u2019s not exactly normal from where I stand. I was so confused when I read your story, that I had to read it twice.

And he offered to help pay but you threw that idea away because it\u2019s all about \u201cpermission\u201d. You\u2019re acting like he read your diary or borrowed money without telling you he borrowed it. I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a permission issue but you\u2019re on that reason so you don\u2019t get judged because it\u2019s about the extra cost on the bill. \n\nSo I\u2019m really curious if he had asked permission would you have said yes from the start or told him where the extra blankets are. Lol", "Hmmm I'd say YTA for how you handled it, but not for wanting him to ask first. \n\nIt was a first time occurance, you didn't have to get so confrontational.

That\u2019s just how I was brought up and it\u2019s a hard habit to break.\nTalk to him about it and just establish some ground rules.", "I\u2019m clearly going to be in the minority here, but I\u2019m going to say ESH. \n\nI\u2019ve been the homeowner with a guest who cranked the AC down without permission. They changed it to 65 while we were out for a few hours, **knowing** that we never crank it that low. It was infuriating, as you can actually send your AC to an early death doing something like that in a hot climate like where we live. He could\u2019ve turned on a fan. He could\u2019ve shot a text and asked if he could turn the AC down a little. It felt very strategic that he waited until we were out to turn our AC on. We\u2019d provided him with a personal tower fan and had let him know that we turned the AC down a little for him already when we noticed he was getting hot. Nobody was hot except for him.\n\nMost people have preset AC/heating temps. When I\u2019m the guest in someone\u2019s home, unless they give me permission to change the settings, I\u2019ll bring up being hot or cold and **ask** before I touch their temp settings. I do think that if OP\u2019s SO has been with her over a year, he knows that he probably gets cold in her place, and the right thing to do would be to ask her about turning the heat up before doing so. It feels passive aggressive to wait until she\u2019s gone to change the settings, and the reality is that it\u2019s not the same as a shower or a cup of coffee. It\u2019s changing the entire temperature of a space, essentially forcing someone else to be at that new temperature with you, regardless of their preferred comfort. The fact that it can be pricy to do so is also important. A shower won\u2019t set OP back significantly the way cranking the heat up for a week might.\n\nThat said, OP- if you\u2019ve been with your SO for over a year, you know that he gets cold. Communication was key here when you allowed him to stay. You should\u2019ve asked on the first day of his stay (before going anywhere) if he was feeling cold as you know he gets cold quickly, and immediately addressed the elephant in the room with something like, \u201cI know I prob keep the place a little colder than you\u2019re comfortable, as I\u2019m trying to save money on my utilities. If you feel too cold, let me know. We can try a sweater or blanket first, and if it\u2019s still too bad, we can talk about turning the heat up a bit.\u201d Instead, it sounds like you just left him to suffer in silence, assuming he\u2019d come find you if it got unbearable. That\u2019s not considerate. As a host, you should want your guests to be (reasonably) comfortable. \n\nYou both suck for not communicating before this got out of hand and for being passive aggressive with each other.", "You are right, you should ask the owner\u2019s permission, it\u2019s common decency.

I think you have a point because I didn't stop asking my bf if I can turn on the a/c in his room, and its been about 5 years. And if it's extremely hot, like in the summer, I'll turn it on for short bursts and just sweat it out despite how much I despise sweating.

Starting the heating is a pretty big deal, and especially this year. depending on the kind of heating system you have turning it on for a day or a few hours might not even be efficient or useful at all. I am trying to resist a couple more weeks myself with the help of blankets and tea. Besides it could be a month before you receive your bill so the offer to pay doesn't sound realistic. I agree that someone starting the heating (not just a space heater) in someone else's house is odd and I'd be pissed as well. NTA.", "NTA I find it rude too. It's the principle of the matter, not about monetary value. It's not in the same league as eating food or watching TV because those are normal and expected behaviors of a guest. Turning on heating or AC is not, maybe there is a reason she has it off? It's not his home, not his money and not his decision. Maybe it's because I come from a country where heating is not really a thing, but still, I would never just turn the heating on at someone else's home (even my boyfriend's) unless it was offered to me, or I asked first.", "I think you opened up the conversation without knowing what you wanted from him. Did you want him to apologize? Turn off the heat and then ask you if he could turn it on? I think this is one of life's little annoyances. It wasn't likely to repeat itself.

Things are going pretty well and we are getting along very nicely. Something happened though yesterday and I am not sure if I handled it correctly.\n\nBasically, my boyfriend asked if he could stay with me for a week, because his roommate has covid and he is trying to not catch it. Because I had it recently already, I agreed. However, when I went to the gym yesterday morning, I noticed that when I got back he turned the heating on! I couldn't help but got annoyed that he would just do such a thing without asking me first. I mean, it's not that I can not afford the energy bill, it is just that he is turning on something that costs me (another person) money.\n\nI get that my boyfriend gets cold quite quickly, but that doesn't mean he can just do whatever he wants and turn on the heating. I don't want him to pay for it or something, I just think it's polite to ask the home owner for permission before turning on the heating. If I were in his position, I would just grab a blanket until my boyfriend got home so I could ask if I can use his heating.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Agreed. This is super controlling behaviour.", "I guess he's not talking much, because he is asking himself those exact questions..and what he feels about it.", "This is it. \n\nIf someone turned on like whole house heating in my house when it's just a little chilly, for example, I'd be a bit wtf because to me it's so obviously expensive that I'd wonder why they think I'm made of money, and why they didn't think of that before they cranked the heating. \n\nBut I also know that not everyone is me and couldn't know if I didn't tell them, so it'd be a 'please don't do that in future', not 'how dare you do that without my permission'.", "I was more baffled that OP knows bf gets cold easily and didn't try to make his house comfortable before it became a problem.

I find it really rude to just turn on or off the heat! \nTo everyone exaggerating the situation in the comments like \"should he ask when he flushes?\", you are beside the point. And btw I still ask my boyfriend of 1.5yrs if it is okay for me to use stuff that are costly such as his washing machine! Bc we're students and I'm not paying his bills!!", "Sounds like you have a case of \"what is mine, is mine\". This does extend to things other than money. Wouldn't you want your boyfriend to be comfortable in your home? I mean, you did agree to house the man for the week so you should've anticipated things won't be and stay as they were. It's difficult living with someone when you aren't use to it but you handled this wrong.", "YTA \n\nYou honestly expected him to wait until you get home to ask you for permission? What if he had to go to the bathroom? Should he hold it until you get home so he doesn\u2019t waste water and toilet paper?", "YTA. I would break up with someone if they denied me basic comfort.", "YTA.  If it isn\u2019t about money, then that\u2019s really controlling.  Your BF asked to stay with you, and you agreed.  That makes him a guest in your home.  Most people would try to make him feel comfortable and welcomed - you did the opposite.  You\u2019ve been together for over a year\u2026 if you ever planned to move in together, get married, etc - this is a step in the opposite direction.  Your relationship should be a partnership, and especially after being together for so long, he shouldn\u2019t need permission to be warm in your house.", "YTA people should feel welcome and comfortable in your home if you've invited them in. Never would I have someone at my place and not adjust the temperature if they were hot or cold and I wouldn't care if they got up and changed it themselves. They should feel at home", "\"You're a guest here\" usually means make yourself at home (in my circles). If it was turned up absurdly high, like 80 degrees, yeah that'd be an issue..  but then you talk about it. You don't make them feel unwelcome. \"Hey, would you ask before turning the heat on? Its just on of my things. We can get a small space heater or extra blankets to help, too!\" \n\nIncidentally, I don't think your position is normal, but it may be location based. I've always lived in cold areas, so our heat is on in some fashion for months every year.\n\nEdit to add YTA - first time offenses are a discussion not accusation", "YTA who are you? My Dad?", "break up now.  you clearly don\u2019t love him", "YTA.\n\nYou say it's not about the money. So, it's about you keeping control of what he does? Is he allowed to shower when you're not home, because that's hot water use. \n\nSeriously, if it's not about the money, like you said, it's then about the principle that he needs to ask permission. If I were him, I'd see it as a huge red flag, since your permission was more important than his comfort.", "YTA\nYou do realize not heating in winter is a risk for mold\nMy english really isn't good enough to explain it but around 14 degree Celsius you need to start the heating\n\nPlus 17 degree is 18 degree under the normal body temperature so of course 20 degree can also be seen as cold\nPlus where i live because of both points landlords have to ensure that the apartments can be heated up to 19 degree at the very least and, not ensuring that can be punishable by law\n\nIf you don't want him to turn it on calmly tell/explain that to him and make sure he has enough blankets and stuff but even then...", "I give your relationship one more week, tops.  And yes, absolutely, YTA.", "NTA, your house. No different than moving furniture around as a guest.  Just don't do that.", "NTA. These YTA\u2019s are super weird, it takes $0 and two seconds for the bf to shoot you a quick, \u201cI\u2019m turning on the heat! Is that cool?\u201d text. \n\nThe money isn\u2019t the problem, the change to communal living conditions without any communication is the mildly uncool part. And even that is only an actual issue now because the bf has decided to sulk about being held to pretty basic standards of communication. \n\nI don\u2019t know about y\u2019all but when you first turn on the heating in some climates, some really interesting burnt-dust smells happen. Insulation sucks occasionally. Heating varies a *lot* across the world, and we\u2019re not sure if this is a modern studio apartment with baseboard heating or a super leaky old three-bed house and a failing furnace that only starts with a kick. That\u2019s why you just have a quick talk when you\u2019re moving somewhere even temporarily. Super simple helpful & courteous. \n\nIts great to hear so many redditors are not concerned about heating bills, but when someone joins a house they should prioritize a chat about how everyone can be kept comfy, then compromise accordingly.", "He\u2019s there for a week. In the few hours it too for you to turn it back down and gently let him know your feelings, how much did it cost you, a dollar? Come on now, YTA", "Its definitely a control thing more than it is money. I wouldn't be surprised if the BF ends up leaving him. YTA OP.", "It seems like that\u2019s the way she went about it to me? She explained herself and he brushed it off.", "Agree. If I were cold and other things (like showering) were done at your house, I'd turn on the heat without question.\n\nYTA. Talk to him like a normal human.", "Actually I totally get this lol. I was raised to ask before picking up someone else's book, let alone change their heating. I wouldn't say anything though! If I let them stay then it is implied they can get comfy", "Are we sure, though? He could have done both.", "They're both dudes, and OP seems kind of controlling.", "I would absolutely turn up my heat if a guest was cold. I would also pile blankets on them, offer them my favorite hoodie and ask if I can make them tea. I\u2019m a very aggressively accommodating host. \n\nI also ask everyone in the house if they mind if I adjust the heat. Temperature tolerance ranges and I\u2019d rather give someone voice their dissent.\n\nIf I was left alone in someone\u2019s house, was frigid, and a blanket and sweater didn\u2019t cut it? Yeah I\u2019d turn on the heat. I don\u2019t deserve having to endure suffering. If they get butthurt, my opinion of them would change, because they belief that I need to suffer even though there is a very obvious solution to the problem. \n\nFor those questioning my use of \u201csuffering\u201d, I live in a frozen wasteland and if the heat is off this time of year, I\u2019d see my breath.", "It is not about the money. The BF offered to pay. If is about control, about dominance. They are in a relationship for over a year. He is living there for a week and is treated less than a guest and MUCH less than a real partner. He is treated as an Inferior.", "Yea! My family had visited, & because I have extra clothes I can throw on & a fan in my room, I showed them how to change the heat vs cool (cause with mine you have to manually change it) because their comfort mattered more than any mild inconvenience of me being too hot/cold or the extra $5 difference after a week of their stay", "but we dont know that he cranked the heat up just that he turned it on in general. now if he put it to like 90f then yeah hes an AH.", "My friend is visiting me next weekend and I'm already anxious because I don't tend to use the heating (for financial reasons), and my house gets cold. \n\nOverall my opinion is, I've clearly warned that it might be cold... if you don't like it, you can get a hotel. But I still get anxious because I feel guilty\n\nThe point is: I don't understand how OP didn't worry about this stuff or discuss it beforehand.", "Op: \u201cclose the fridge!! It\u2019s not about the money, but you\u2019re spending my money!\u201d", "Not true, especially for women.", "Oh the humanity! \n\nShe\u2019s just picking a fight to pick one. Sounds like the \u201cbroken bowl\u201d of the relationship.", "I can totally see them having an abusive parent yelling at them because they were a cold little kid who wanted heat", "Exactly if you're that serious about heating just get a smart thermostat like a nest one, YTA", "I also am an in-house dogsitter, and AC is almost always discussed prior to booking when I'm doing the initial assessment. I treat it the same as I do water and electricity\u2013I use what is necessary. If someone is that picky about the thermostat, they need to tell me up front. \n\nIn this case, it's the dude's boyfriend. I'm assuming he didn't crank it up 10 degrees, but OP didn't say BF couldn't adjust it. Best way to handle it would be to say, \"Hey, it's no big deal but I'm kinda weird about my thermostat and I'd prefer it if you asked next time.\"", "I would\u2019ve thought maybe it was auto, & OP\u2019s usually out of the house & he forgot to change it for his week stay, & that it would\u2019ve be the end of the world to raise it for a couple hours", "With the appropriate clothing even tiny cold women like myself can be comfortable at 20C. You just can\u2019t expect to hang out in underwear, but I wear my layers appropriate to the season and am very comfortable.\n\nTo give you context, my ideal room temperature would be around 28C if I were to wear light clothes. But with winter clothes, 20 degrees work.", "Agreed.  I'm living in a country now where the people dress in layers like they are headed on an Arctic expedition, and yet complain LOUDLY if the temperature is below 28.\n\nSome people can be comfortable around 23, but that is still on the cool side.  I  think OP mentioned the place was 17 without heat on.  That's pretty cool.  I'd definitely be wearing at least a light jacket until the heat kicked in.\n\nOn a side note, I rarely turn on my heat.  Because everybody living below me has their heat turned up to sauna mode, my apartment tends to settle around 25-27 without the heater running, unless I open a windows to cool it down a bit", "Exactly! If you\u2019ve been dating for a year and still expect someone to act like a first time guest\u2026yikes.", "I'm also in Canada and I've never seen that in my life. Heat is on or off"]}
