My wife, Jenna, and I have been together for seven years and married for four, so I've been in my stepdaughters life for a while now. I think of her as my own and as far as I know she's never had a problem with me.\n\nMy stepdaughter, Ava I think I'll call her, is very pretty, but also introverted. Her grades are great and she never goes out and me and Jenna are more than happy about it. I like having her in the house where I can keep an eye on her. But as of late, things have been changing.\n\nAva introduced her boyfriend to us a few weeks ago and has been spending a lot of time with him. I know this is normal at her age, but something about the kid rubs me the wrong way. Jenna has no problem with this and says she likes him, but I disagree. I feel like he's a bad influence as Ava has been staying out later which she never did before. This has been bothering me for a while, but since Jenna was fine with it, I held my tongue.\n\nBut last night I couldn't take it anymore. Ava tried to leave the house with a shirt that barely covered her chest (it's freaking February, there's no reason for her to wear that) to go out with her boyfriend. I finally put my foot down and told her to go change or she wasn't allowed. She looked surprised and asked what the problem was and I told her that she wasn't allowed to dress like tgat. Ava told me that she didn't see a problem with what she was wearing and I said that I do and she needs to change. She did agree without arguing anymore and left in a much more appropriate shirt.\n\nAva hasn't said anything to Jenna (she doesn't get home until later), but she isn't speaking to me as much and I'm wondering if I was too harsh on her.

Transitioning from childhood to womanhood is a really hard time for any girl. People feel they can comment on every aspect of your appearance and somehow it\u2019s always wrong, no matter what you do or no matter what you wear.

She is 17 years old. She is coming into her own but you want her to be 12. You better get over yourself real soon because she will be going to college or moving out and living her own life before you know it. The boyfriend thing is cringeworthy, also. It sounds like the only thing this kid has done is take your stepdaughter out and had fun together. Were you ever a teenager or did you just pop outta the womb the uptight, stuffed shirt you are?

Your job now is to let her screw up and help her up when she falls both with good advice and if possible, resources when needed.\n\nSit her and your wife down and talk about your feelings, your concerns, and what's making you uncomfortable. Negotiate agreeable boundaries, like maintaining her grades, encourage Mom to have the sex talk with her and provide her with the pill and condoms so that she doesn't get pregnant as a teen. Tell her about your mistakes at that age - not in a lecture way but so she knows one it's okay to screw up and two, maybe don't screw up the ways you did.\n\nAnd work on this: Your stepdaughter is going to shag. She's going to experiment and guys are going to enjoy her. If that makes you insecure, jealous, or scared you need to explore those feelings and resolve them without lashing out at her. She'll only run away.\n\nBut more than anything, get 100% on board with your wife on how to handle all of these situations. Express feelings and get in her corner. You are in a precarious place. Your stepdaughter could easily view you as a problematic figure rather than a good caring father figure. You can cross lines here very, very easily and that forgiveness won't come easy.", "YTA, and I think you need to move forward carefully from this. In your post you say she's a good kid. She's been raised well, behaves well, good grades, etc. You say the problem isn't her, it's her boyfriend. You don't like him (though you don't say why in particular).\n\nSo if the problem is something with the boyfriend, why did you turn it around and make the problem into her clothing? Because now if the boyfriend does something unspeakable to her, she's always going to wonder if she caused it because of her clothing. You've set a precedent that her clothes, and therefore her choices, are the cause of other people's bad actions. Its a victim-blaming mindset and hard to come back from. \n\nIf you're truly worried about her boyfriend, or future guys in her life, have a discussion with her about how she deserves to be treated. Highlight respectful behavior and give her a good example so she knows what being treated well looks like, and that she's always allowed to leave someone or someplace if she doesn't want to be there. Discuss early warning signs of abuse, let her know that she can count on you if she needs you. Give her tools for success, don't take away her confidence by picking on her clothes.", "As a former 17 year old girl I can tell you with 99.9% certainty, she ripped that new shirt off the second she was out of your sight and had the original shirt on underneath.", "Gotta love when your sister sets you up. \ud83e\udd23\n\nOf course YTA.

It appears the only reason you don\u2019t like the kid is because she spends more time than you wish with him. Reevaluate your perspective here and see if you\u2019re being controlling or really only have her best interests at heart.

My wife, Jenna, and I have been together for seven years and married for four, so I've been in my stepdaughters life for a while now. I think of her as my own and as far as I know she's never had a problem with me.\n\nMy stepdaughter, Ava I think I'll call her, is very pretty, but also introverted. Her grades are great and she never goes out and me and Jenna are more than happy about it. I like having her in the house where I can keep an eye on her. But as of late, things have been changing.\n\nAva introduced her boyfriend to us a few weeks ago and has been spending a lot of time with him. I know this is normal at her age, but something about the kid rubs me the wrong way. Jenna has no problem with this and says she likes him, but I disagree. I feel like he's a bad influence as Ava has been staying out later which she never did before. This has been bothering me for a while, but since Jenna was fine with it, I held my tongue.\n\nBut last night I couldn't take it anymore. Ava tried to leave the house with a shirt that barely covered her chest (it's freaking February, there's no reason for her to wear that) to go out with her boyfriend. I finally put my foot down and told her to go change or she wasn't allowed. She looked surprised and asked what the problem was and I told her that she wasn't allowed to dress like tgat. Ava told me that she didn't see a problem with what she was wearing and I said that I do and she needs to change. She did agree without arguing anymore and left in a much more appropriate shirt.\n\nAva hasn't said anything to Jenna (she doesn't get home until later), but she isn't speaking to me as much and I'm wondering if I was too harsh on her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe her boyfriend is giving her the confidence to spread her wings a little bit, sometimes an introvert just needs a safe space to bud. As much as you don\u2019t want to hear it, at 17 it\u2019s extremely likely she\u2019s going to have sex with this boy if things carry on going well (if they haven\u2019t already) and the boyfriend is going to experience a hell of a lot more of her than an open cut top. You cannot control this, you cannot stop this, make peace with this fact. \n\nWhat you need to consider is your relationship with her, this is something you can control. You can be a stick in the mud, make her life difficult and \u2018force\u2019 her to do things she doesn\u2019t want to do, but all you will do is sully your relationship with her.

You\u2019ve made one of the classic parenting mistakes and essentially used \u201ccause I said so\u201d as a reasoning for something.

This is normal behavior, not \"bad influence\" behavior.\n\nAnd just a little icing on the cake here - it's February and I live in the US.

Then talk to Ava about how you feel - as no judgementally as possible - about revealing clothing on minors and staying out late. This won't be a conversation about a boy, but rather about her being as safe and responsible as a young lady like herself can be when out and about as a teenager at night.\n\nAnd if all this **is** just about the boy...then you need to reevaluate why you hate a boy who your wife and stepdaughter have no problem with.

You sound possessive and controlling.", "Two things to unpack here:\n\n1) Should a father (or parent at all) tell a (17yo) minor what they can or cannot wear (even if it's a biological child).  In general, putting down hard rules of \"thou shall not show skin\" is simply not the right way to parent in my opinion.  As a bio-father of a daughter (who is too young for this right now), I would not do that.  If I felt she was being too revealing, I would have a conversation with her about why I would like her to reconsider.  Things like, \"it's your body, but if you put yourself out there as if your flesh is all that matters, it attracts certain attention and men/boys you might not want.\"  Ultimately, it's her decision, but I also would not like it.  That's me, can't help it.  I would not say \"you can't go out\" unless there were like nips and/or panties showing.  It would have to be extreme to the point of me thinking she has a mental disorder to say \"absolutely not\" (or if she was like 12, but 17 is a different tale).\n\n2) You're a step-dad.  For that reason, as others have pointed out, it feels wholly inappropriate.  If you said you've raised her since childhood and she views you as her real dad, I might feel different.  As a bio-dad, talking anything about sexuality with my daughter is going to be brutally difficult.  As a step-dad, I would not touch it with a 10 foot pole.\n\nSorry to say, YTA.", "YTA", "NTA - sounds like you did a normal Dad thing. I remember my parents doing the same thing.

I think what he did was fine since isnt he just looking out for his daughter shouldnt parents care about how their children are seen and the fact that after she got a boyfriend she started dressing like that should show she isnt just doing it for herself, cant the father just be worried for his daughter. but hey i can be wrong and like some of the comments say he likes his daughter a bit to much \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Get back in your lane, creep.\n\nYTA.", "YTA so much here.\n\nYour entire post is about controlling and sexualizing your step- daughter, and is creepy as fuck.", "You do come off as a borderline creepy dad with the weird obsession about her being in the house.

The original post is unclear since we have no idea how old your kid is.\n\nBut she's 17 (answered in the comments). That means she's less then a year from being a fully free adult. This is not the age to be exerting a lot of control over minor things (what shirt she is wearing to a date). This is the age where you are loosening control down to almost nothing beacuse in less then a year you'll have no ability to tell her what to do. She has to make her own choices and you have to trust you raised her well enough. You can continue to *influence* your adult child, but to do that you have to build a relationship of influence. Where you talk to your kid and don't command them, and where they then care about what you think and your values.\n\nIf you really felt something she was doing was an issue, unless there was some immediate danger, you need to have an adult conversation with her about it. One where you don't lead with judgement so that there's the best chance your kid will be receptive. One where you don't just command but honestly try to understand their pov, and then bring up your concerns for her to consider.\n\nSo you need to really stop and think *what* your concerns are. Beacuse you don't like it isn't enough anymore. You need to be able to articulate what you have issue with and why that's a bad idea. Stop and think. What exactly are you afraid of? Is it just hard for you that your daughter is growing up? Do you see her as a little girl instead of a young women? Are you worried about her safety? Are you worried about her getting hurt emotionally? Etc.\n\nRealistically, young women are going to want to look sexy for the people they are into sometimes. They may end up wanting to  have sex. And they aren't going to want to spend every evening at home with their parents. Accepting that, think about what your concerns for your daughter are and sit her down for a talk. Tell her you are sorry about how you acted, you were being overprotective in a controlling way and you see that now. Then say whatever it is you have to say.\n\nMaybe it's that you love her and her dating makes you nervous beacuse you know not all men treat women with the care and respect they deserve. You're worried that she might end up being mistreated or pressured, harmed physically or emotionally. You realize it's normal for her to want to look hot sometimes, you just want to make sure any guy she chooses loves her for more then her body beacuse she's such a wonderful kind smart hard-working person and being pretty isn't what makes her so amazing. You also want her to know that her body is hers, no one should ever pressure her to do anything she dosen't want to or isn't ready for, and if anyone who does push dosen't deserve here. Same with any guy who cheats or disrespects her. There are many men out there, and many aren't going to be the good man she deserves, so you want her to know it's okay to move on and keep looking. It's even okay to break up with a good man who  has done nothing wrong if being together dosen't make her happy. That's the point of dating, it's a trial run to see if you are a good match, so it's okay (even if it hurts) if it dosen't. Most people don't end up marrying their first boyfriend, but it's not impossible either, so you're going to try to give boyfriend a fair chance and not judge him too harshly. Tell her you are always there for her if any guy isn't treating her right. You are always there for her if she needs to move back home to get out of a bad situation, no I told you sos. You are always there if she needs to call you at night to come get her, and she won't be in any trouble.", "Especially right after the very first thing he mentions about her is how pretty she is.", "YTA, the whole thing reads as jealous and possessive.

At my son's middle school, there are some young girls who dress sort of provocatively. No judgment here (I envy their confidence!) but I fear for their safety because there are barely-pubescent boys (and even grown men) who take a bit of exposed cleavage as an invitation. I saw horrible things done to girls in my own middle school years by boys who were either too immature to understand the harm they were causing, or just assholes.\n\nI am not saying that girls are responsible for boys' actions, but I am saying that it's our job as adults to protect them from other people's shitheaded sons, and to educate our own sons about consent.

Ew.", "me too since he made it sound like this was a first boyfriend.", "If I had a teenage kid that dressed as if she wanted others to look at her chest, I would try to talk to her about it. It's good to be cautious but it's not good to go ballistic over things. Spending more time with guys will happen. I might also have my reserved judgements based on how the guy looks, acts, or even dresses. Teenagers trying to get that sort of attention will happen as well. It takes good communication and trust from both parent and child to help guide the child away from situations that could end in regret.\n\nOP seems to be doing things the wrong way.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with that, and it is something everyone does in one way or the other. And maybe you didn't read comments that either were from OP or from others who read comments from OP. So, and this may or may not change things for you and that is okay. Just in case:\n\n1. OP's step daughter is 17 years old. Not a young teen, definitely in my opinion at an age where it is far too late to suddenly be making new rules that weren't in place before when she is nearly an adult and could potentially peace out and go noncontact in a year at most but could even be next month.. we don't know her actual birthday.\n\n2. He did very much say that the biological mother doesn't seem to be upset with what she is wearing to go out, or with the boyfriend. OP doesn't like him for \"reasons\" he hasn't said that i have seen up to while I am responding to you.\n\n3. He doesn't say his step daughter has a curfew, or what her curfew is. Just that she used to be home all of the time and now that she has a boyfriend she stays out more than she used to. I don't know about you, but on a post where I am trying to find out if I was the asshole or not, if my 17 year old broke a set rule I would have put that in the initial post.\n\n4. He said in the post that the shirt she wore was too revealing so he made her change. In comments someone said that OP said it would have been fine if it was warm weather to war but in the cold it is wrong to wear. How does this make any sense?  The shirt isn't a magical object. It looks the same in any weather. If he was concerned about her being cold then he should have asked her to wear a jacket or something \n\n6. I don't know your life, or your experiences, or anything about you at all. I just. If you can't read the way this is written and not see how it would make a 17 year old girl uncomfortable I can't help you see it. I can promise you that it makes 17 year old me as well as 34 year old me different degrees of uncomfortable and gives me so many flashbacks. \n\n8. There was a comment on this post that summed up exactly why it feels weird without calling out OP or calling him a creep that will explain it better than I ever could. I hope you are arguing in good faith, and if so please go read that comment. I don't know how to direct link to a comment on a post but it is by Top Ramenisha and it wasn't too far from the bottom when I was scrolling.", "I mean on top of that he\u2019s not her real dad. My stepdad will not dictate what I do; he leaves that to my mom", "In fairness my body is super bad at temp regulation and that sounds *ideal* to me and I might need to go find one.\n\nAs just a fashion trend, I mean, bring a jacket with you so you aren't shivering.", "I am horrified over your uncles behavior. How does he not understand that gives trauma for life?", "Geez, that's awful. My dad has been a pastor for over 50 years. I grew up on Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Beatles, and all sorts of blues, classic rock, and Woodstock Era stuff. I've always had a pretty eclectic fashion style. Over the years, my dad has noticed all of my somewhat strange ensembles, and he would usually crack a sarcastic but hilarious joke about it. We'd both laugh and he'd tell me to have a blessed day. Your family sounds weird.", "Reading this brought back a lot of teen trauma surrounding this with my family.. the fact that your uncle decided it was ok to touch your shorts at all let alone pull on them is so disturbing.. I was shamed by adult male relatives (blood and by marriage) in my family ever since I got boobs.. women on both sides of my family are very well endowed and by 13 I had DD.. it was IMPOSSIBLE to find swimwear that didn\u2019t make me look \u201clike a hoochy\u201d.. I would go to my uncles house for a family \u201choliday cookout event\u201d at 13-14 years old and get pulled aside and told I should be wearing a t shirt if I wanted to swim.. one piece or not it didn\u2019t matter.. it got so bad I just stopped swimming.. and now 20 years later I still don\u2019t swim and feel very uncomfortable in my own body.. even regular tank tops where not appropriate.. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE.. STOP SHAMING/SEXUALIZING CHILDREN.. not only is it disgusting it\u2019s very traumatic and will affect them in adulthood", "Your uncle! Holy shiz!", "I would rather go back to the random sleeve cutout trends lol", "I\u2019m honestly not sure either, but I\u2019m giving him the benefit of the doubt as a stranger. My instinct though is to think it\u2019s a control thing. They feel like they have the right to set the world straight the way they believe it should be and keep people in their place. \nBut then again sometimes it has to do with some sort of claim they think they have over a woman\u2019s \u201cpurity\u201d. I had a purity ring when I was 16 and looking back now I can\u2019t help but think how weird it is that it\u2019s some sort of covenant between my dad and I. My parents are still concerned with my purity! They\u2019d be heartbroken to know that their daughter has healthy and loving sex with the love of her life, which to me is so sad.", "Yes. In my experience, the womanizers are always the ones most concerned about protecting their women. It's because they think all men are like them. To reach to the front of her shorts, that's is just bizzare behavior.", "The really sad thing is this is one of my favorite uncles. He\u2019s not a villain. In all respects, he\u2019s a very sweet man. He loves my aunt more than anyone and calls my grandma every day. He just has very conservative views, and all I could think in that moment is \u201cwhy is he touching me\u201d.", "My family is sooo weird! You\u2019re dad, on the other hand, sounds awesome!", "I\u2019m so sorry you had this experience! And you\u2019re so right. Shaming and specializing children is incredibly harmful!", "It is sad. I'm sorry", "That is such a conflict, I understand. He is a covert predator. I have to say, they are the ones that have a lot of skeletons in the closet because they are charismatic, devoted husband and no one expects them to to be a predator. He sexualized you, he essentially groped you, he crossed a boundary. Watch this man like a hawk with yourself and other vulnerable young girls. Set hard boundaries and scream loud when he crosses them. Do the same when anyone touches you without your consent. Be safe.", "I remember once when I was about 17 and finally cleaned my pig pen of a room. My dad walks in and says, \"You see this thing here? The thing we're standing on? It's called a 'floor.' I just wanted to make sure you weren't collapsing from the shock of seeing one in your room.\" Even as an adult, my dad and I banter back and forth like that all the time. It's like our love language \ud83e\udd23"]}
