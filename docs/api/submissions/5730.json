It's boxing day night, I've gone to the fridge to get some Christmas snacks and I've heard my brother (32 M) and his wife (34 F) fully at it in my bed (they are sleeping in my room as I'm single so on the couch and my parents suck for marital 'togetherness', i didnt mind until now). The thought makes me feel sick so the midnight snack is now a no go. I was just about to order a new mattress, but I thought they should be the ones to replace it. But then I thought -- maybe I'm dramatic and a few nights on the couch will help me forget what my poor mattress has seen. I'm not sure I can afford mattress therapy. \n\nMy other issue is they're supposed to be borrowing my car for a week, starting tomorrow. I'm not sure i want to trust them with my things anymore... am I the asshole!?", "created_utc": 1672100898, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw1kt0/aita_for_requesting_a_new_mattress_after_my/", "score": 328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would be for sure. My space is my space and I think it is disrespectful for people to fuck in my bed. That said, I think a new mattress might be slight overkill. If you\u2019re itching for some compensation you could ask for a new set of sheets and move on. NTA\n\nETA - to everybody mentioning a hotel bed like it\u2019s some sort of \u201cgotcha\u201d, everybody knows people fuck, masterbate, shit, cum, bleed, and die on hotel beds. Do you want that shit happening in your bed in your home? No? Then shut up about a goddamn hotel bed.", "NTA. Thats disgusting. Have them pay for it to be professionally cleaned, tho. You CAN do that.", "NTA. Having intercourse in someone else's bed is so disrespectful and disgusting. I totally understand why you would be bothered sleeping there from now on and I'd totally do the same. However maybe talk to your brother first in private, mention how you don't think it was okay of them to spill their body fluids who knows where (and make you listen to them) and how you don't feel comfortable sleeping on the mattress anymore. Maybe he'll offer to pay for a new one himself, maybe he'll become embarrassed or just angry saying sex is normal and you're prude. Idk", "Against the grain but NTA. Asking for a new mattress is a bit over the top, but it\u2019s extremely disrespectful of them to have sex in a bed that\u2019s not theirs. They won\u2019t get a fucking divorce if they don\u2019t have sex every night (if they do then that\u2019s a whole other issue). \n\nA healthy couple should be able to realize that it\u2019s their sister/SIL\u2019s own personal bed that she graciously gave to them at her parents insistence and should be able to not have sex for a few nights until they go home (but apparently, I\u2019m fucking bananas to this sub to not have self control and respect for someone else\u2019s bed). I would not give them your car and I\u2019d tell them the reason why. If they get angry just ask them if their 10 minutes of pleasure and getting fluids on your sheets was worth it.", "I'd let them know they weren't quiet about their sex and ask them to please not do that in your bed as you find it gross and disrespectful.  Surely they know how to control themselves and forgo boinking at other family's homes.", "NTA\n\nFor your feelings. Having sex in someone else\u2019s bed is pretty disrespectful! \n\nI would let them know I heard and you expect them to strip the bed and mattress protector, quilt etc and wash them and change the sheets!", "NTA which is an unpopular opinion in this comment section apparently lmao\nIt's your bed, you're allowed to feel uncomfortable knowing someone else is having sex on it. It's never that serious, they could've waited until they got home .", "Nta imo idk why everyone\u2019s acting like yta. It\u2019s disrespectful and gross to do things like that when it comes to other peoples stuff and yes I know it\u2019s normal but it still can make other people uncomfortable, everyone\u2019s boundaries are different and now everytime you\u2019re going to get in your bed this is the memory that is going to bring back also some people are highly scared or germs so this definitely isn\u2019t helping.

Id be mortified if people could hear me having sex. I have slept in countless hotel beds but i do not care. my bed is my safe zone. I'd never let another couple sleep in my bed. And when me and my long-term BF travel, we do not do it in other people's beds, just hotel beds/air bnbs. Because thats just nasty. I'm not going into my aunt's bed and thinking: wow I can't wait to have sex where aunt and uncle old as hell sleep.  \n\n\nJust, no. NTA. You never agreed to any of this.

How could a brother do that to his little sister. \ud83d\ude05", "NTA why in the fuck would full grown adults think it\u2019s okay to fuck in their siblings bed.

Change the sheets and go on with your life, sheesh.", "YTA, hotels does not replace their mattresses and we know those beds were dirty up by singles and couples alike. \n\nIf you just want a new mattress, just asked them as a Christmas present.

It's sex. They didn't sacrifice a goat on your Lilly Pulitzer duvet.", "YTA. Have you never slept in a hotel?

Maybe a mattress protector or new sheets.", "NTA But just ask them to get your mattress professionally cleaned instead of buying a new one.", "NTA your house your rules.\n\nIt's also gross that they are being loud enough for you to hear too.", "If your parents love marital togetherness so much they can go have sex in their bed, I'm sure they won't mind", "Flip the mattes and suck it up.

If they ask why, tell them.\n\nAlso, to the people saying it's no big deal, personally I don't want people having sex in my bed, in my room or in my house if they don't live in it. Everyone feels differently but this isn't some weird boundary, some people don't want others having sex on their personal space.", "NTA for being disgusted by their behavior, but demanding a new mattress is a bit much and won't get you far. I'd rescind the offer of them borrowing your car and tell them exactly why. Having sex in someone else's bed is beyond gross and they deserve to be shamed for it.", "ESH - I do not blame you for the way you feel as adult being turfed out of their bedroom and being forced to sleep on the sofa. Your bedroom is your personal space. Your parents are AHs for turfing you out of your room. It's even worse if you are paying rent/board to your parents.\n\nYour brother and SIL are AHs for disrespecting your property by having a root on your bed and probably making a mess.\n\nI completely understand where you are coming from, OP. But demanding a whole new mattress is a little overboard, considering you have a mattress protector. Your best bet is to get the bed protector and sheets cleaned. It will be a good time to get the mattress deep cleaned, as they do need one every so often.\n\nAs for your car, do you own it and is it registered in your name?

Ask them to wash the sheets before they leave.", "As adults, sex in other people's beds is disrespectful. But not everyone feels that way, clearly. But requesting a new mattress is over the top.\n\nAs for the car, why are they borrowing your car? That's over the top generous. If they need a ride here or there, ok, but they shouldn't be flat out borrowing your car. They can get a rental. I don't know their driving habits, but there are few people who I'd be ok with borrowing my car. It depends on how respectful and responsible they are.", "NTA. I am very germaphobic and I completely understand where you are coming from.

Mattresses are very expensive and they're not ruined by one night, you should be fine as soon as you recover emotionally from the event. What you can do though is ask your brother to do the laundry of the sheets they've used or something like that, I think it would be fair.\n\nAlso and more importantly, you should talk to them about how they've disrespected your boundaries and that it made you highly uncomfortable and you don't want them to stay in your room again. He should know that it was a disrespectful thing to do to you and that it is not ok, and that you're right to be mad about it.", "NTA. You were being kind enough to let them use your bed while you\u2019re on the couch, and they\u2019re ok with potentially messing up your mattress.

YOUD MAKE ME REPLACE IT! Which is EXACTLY what OP should do! Don\u2019t even think of loaning them your car unless you want to scrape out cum and bubblegum!

You do them a favor and welcome them into your home and let them sleep in your bed and they think it's a great place to go at it? They treated your bedroom and matress like it was a hotel bed with no regards to you. They should replace it and let them know how disrespectful it was for them to do that and take advantage of your kindness.\n\nEdit to add: what went through your brother's mind to think it was okay to have sex in his SISTER'S bed? You would think he would be turned off by that thought but here we are. \nI think people aren't considering how icky it would feel to go to bed every night knowing your brother had sex on it, mattress protector or not.", "NTA: I think what you\u2019re doing it fair tbh \n\nThey chose to be disrespectful and fuck in your bed \n\nAnybody who thinks it\u2019s more disrespectful to buy a new mattress is goofy in the brain", "NTA\n\nDon't think you can ask for a new bed but that's a gross thing to do and you should ban them from sleeping over again and not let them take your car. The hell is wrong with people doing that in your sisters bed.", "NTA \nI definitely think it was disrespectful of them to have sex in your bed, and I would tell them to either understand that the place isn't theirs and there's things they can't do, or just straight up tell them to get a hotel room next time.\nHowever I do think that maybe asking for a new mattress is over reacting, but I understand where you are coming from. Maybe ask them to pay for the cleaning of the mattress/sheets?", "NTA,\n\nI have a thing about cleanliness. When I let someone borrow something of mine I expect to see it come back the same. My sister decide to listen to a movie with her boyfriend (She told me they did nothing) And I just yelled at her (we were to young to buy an entire mattress).\n\nPeople see to just change the sheet, but still, it's your bed, not a hotel room. I would ask them to buy a new one or pay one of those thing that can clean mattress or couch.\n\nAnd also, it super disrespectful to do it in someone else bed, it not like they cannot contained themselves for a few night.", "They're definitely TA here because that's incredibly rude, but I feel like asking for a new mattress might be a bit of an extreme reaction. Yeah, it's icky, but vacuum it/change the liner and maybe ask for new sheets?

Just no. I dunno if I\u2019d demand a new mattress but I recently slept in my younger sisters bed with my partner when I went home for Xmas and it DIDNT EVEN CROSS OUR MINDS TO HAVE SEX IN MY SISTERS BED. FKN YUCK. That is so disrespectful and gross. I would definitely mention it at least and just tell them you\u2019re not comfortable with them sleeping in your bed again as they\u2019ve definitely crossed a line here. Not okay.", "Unless it was just the exposed mattress then there isn\u2019t too much of an issue besides maybe asking them to wash the sheets and blankets. YTA for asking for an entirely new bed", "NTA but it\u2019s overkill.   \nPretty rude to do it loud enough to be heard by you or your parents too. Also, anyone willing to let them borrow his car for a week is hardly an AH. I\u2019d worry more about that than the mattress.", "YTA. Ask them to wash the sheets and maybe keep it down a bit, but sex doesn't ruin a mattress. They're grown adults. Not trusting them with your car because of this is bonkers.", "ESH I caught my brother and his girlfriend having sex in my bed. I made them wash my sheets and asked them next time use the guestroom. I wasn't happy about the situation but I didn't want to be dramatic about it either.", "I would say slight YTA. It's gross to think about them doing it in your bed but everybody does it. You have a mattress protector. Just strip all the sheets and was then in hot water with sanitizer if it bothers you that much.", "Of course YTA. You've used this mattress for how long? Long enough that were planning on buying a new one but they used it and now it's ruined by them and they should have to replace it? Change the sheets, buy your new mattress and stop being dramatic.", "yta.  Couples have sex.  My husband and I have sex at my inlaws all the time when we sleep over And my mother-in-law sometimes sleeps in that bed.  But, she is an adult and we strip the bed and all is well.  Strip the mattress pad and sheets... maybe go hog wild and buy another mattress pad and new sheets.  If you had a problem with it, don't offer your bed.  When the mood strikes, especially when you have a kid, you seize the moment because another one may not come for a while.  My son was conceived in Lake George in a house we rented.", "Wait till you find out about hotel rooms.", "YTA because sex doesn't destroy a mattress. Think back to all the times you sat on your parents' bed as a kid. They had sex on that, and you were fine.\n\nA new mattress is overkill.\n\nThat said, I'm on your side. I'd also feel violated. A WAY more appropriate option might be to ask them to sterilise it. They can go to Lowe's or Home Depot or something and rent a steamer for under $50 easy. Take the sheets off, wash them, and steam the mattress. All good.\n\nIf they refuse, just... Flip the mattress over.", "YTA. Asking them to replace the sheets/cover if it's too much for you to live with them even washed is about as far as you can take this aversion of yours. Asking for a new mattress because yours has \"seen\" (?) sex by someone else is kind of bizarre. \n\nYou agreed to let them sleep in your room, TOGETHER. Did you not think this might happen? You are entirely within your rights not to loan your car, however. It's your car.", "Surely you\u2019re joking\u2026 ? Of course YWBTA if you asked that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with them having sex in whatever bed they\u2019re in. It\u2019s not like it was missing sheets. Also, if this is how you feel, I would suggest avoiding hotels.", "YTA\n\nSex isn\u2019t inherently filthy or something. They also shit in your toilet and probably washed their ass in your shower. Are they disgusting in some way or do you just have a sex hangup? \n\nI get that it\u2019s your bed and you feel protective of it, and there\u2019s the sibling ick factor, but they didn\u2019t contaminate it. Just ask them to strip the bed and throw the sheets in the washer when they\u2019re leaving - that\u2019s good manners anyway - and you won\u2019t have to touch them. \n\nIn the future don\u2019t give up your bed. You\u2019re an adult, it\u2019s your private space, and they can sleep on an air mattress.", "ESH. You don't need a new bed unless there waa a crap ton of bodily fluids soaking in it. \n\nBut they are AH for doing it in your bed. That's gross and disrespectful to the max.", "Maybe new sheets.  Not the whole mattress.  And have fun telling them you heard them in the AM.  Perhaps give them a grading out of 10.\nYTA if you ask for a new mattress.", "YTA - you knew they were a couple, you gave them your bed, it's honestly weird that you would be surprised they had sex. Asking them to buy you a whole new mattress when there's nothing actually wrong with yours is way over the top and nobody would agree to that anyway so you may as well avoid creating drama.", "Yea! YTA, unless they soiled it somehow it\u2019s not ruined. Get over yourself.", "NTA, tell them you are disgusted with what they did and they should have more self control and they are never sleeping in your bed again. That's just gross.", "ESH. It is so wildly disrespectful to have sex in someone else's bed. But you need to just wash your sheets and get over it.", "YTA - wash the sheets or get new ones. My god are you being over dramatic. Have you stayed at a hotel before? Guess what a lot of people have bumped uglies on those beds and they just wash the sheets and you sleep on those now don\u2019t you", "YTA.\n\nYou've probably slept on many mattresses that people have had sex on (hotels).\n\nWash the sheets, don't let them stay over again and have a discussuon with them about why you're upset and use thar to decide about loaning them your car.\n\nAsking for a new mattress is ridiculous though.", "I mean 100% YWBTA to try to make them pay for a new mattress. Are you kidding? \n\nThis is either about fluids/cleanliness, in which case you are willfully blind to how many pre-sexed mattresses you have slept on in your life OR...\n\nThis is about boundaries. And unless you are literal nun in training (Buddhist or catholic, both celibate), or this topic has come up EXPLICITLY in the past, or some other weird thing like your bros girlfriend is your ex, known germophobia, you live in a country where premarital sex is punishable by lashes etc...then you have no right to penalize them for doing something totally normal. \n\nI mean they should automatixally strip the bed afterward (imo) but thats it.

They can take the sheets they did the dirty on home with them so they can remember that one time the need was so great they besmirched my comfort place with my brother\u2019s bodily fluids. Wonder if they\u2019ll think it was worth it, especially since I\u2019d rescind the offer of using my car, too, but that\u2019s just me.\n\nAnd before anyone comes for me about \u201cacting like a child\u201d, I\u2019m an almost 30 year old woman who happens to be a sex repulsed asexual. There is **nothing** childish about thinking your brother having sex in your bed is gross and giving that action consequences to match the disgust the act would give me.", "You're definitely NTA. Maybe a new mattress might be a lot, but definitely pull your brother aside and let him know that it's not okay. A new mattress pad and new sheets might help you feel more secure rather than have them pay for a new mattress. If it's one thing they should definitely NOT do, it's have sex in your bed. Just let him know.", "YTA for wanting to make a totally unnecessary scene out of nothing. Just accept that for a  majority of people sex is not something dirty, disgusting or disrespecting. Your attitude is very immature, you need to grow out of a childish \"ewww, seeex\".
