I understand that you're frustrated, but how you handled this situation is not only cruel but particularly baffling for the parent of a diagnosed autistic child who I would assume has at least gotten some information about how autism works. I have ASD, finally diagnosed when I was 30. Unlike you, my mom had to navigate raising an autistic child with a lot of behavioral problems without even a clue as to what the actual root cause was, and still *not* *once* did she ever do something this intentionally, and maliciously heartless.\n\nYou mention hygiene. Have you tried at all to understand if there's sensory issues and if so what they are? While it's possible, I would be surprised if she had absolutely zero sensory issues especially considering you say you have to 'fight her.' Teens are still learning how to communicate and can have trouble finding words for what bothers them. On top of that, autistic people can also have 'shut downs,' which hopefully you're familiar with but if not, here's a link: [https://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/manage-autism-shutdown/](https://www.autismparentingmagazine.com/manage-autism-shutdown/)\n\nSome examples: I loathe mint toothpaste and avoided brushing my teeth as a young teen because that's all we had, and the toothbrush was too stiff and it hurt. As an adult, I figured out toothpaste came in fruit flavors and got a softer brush. Showers? For me personally, they can sometimes be soothing but if I'm in sensory overload it feels like getting hit by tiny needles and I have to dry off as soon as possible because the feeling of wet skin makes me feel gross. Have you tried asking her what specifically she doesn't like about showers? Tried baths instead? Gotten a different shower head?\n\nA lot of deodorant smells overwhelmingly strong and fake to me - have you tried finding one that she can tolerate? What about the same for lotions and hair products? I have a hyperawareness of anything touching me, so using either pads and tampons feel like having a rock in my shoe all day. Have you tried finding options like period panties that many have suggested on here?\n\nDo you have her in any kind of therapy, occupational, individual etc? Have you tried talking to any professionals about how to navigate this, or at very least read books or watched videos by autistic people talking about how they experience the world and ways a parent can help them? Yes, this kind of trauma might \"\"fix'\"\" the outward behavior. For example, a child might learn that if he is too loud when he gets excited, the parent will scream in his face and shake him \u2013 but that's *fear*, a *trauma* *response*, taking over that kid's brain. It doesn't help him develop healthy life skills at all.\n\nI have to navigate the world knowing that a lot of it will be unavoidably uncomfortable, overwhelming, and inaccessible to me.
