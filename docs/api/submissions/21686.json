I would potty train earlier (18 months) but my children\u2019s daycare cannot accommodate potty trained children until they move into the 2 year old room. I strongly dislike changing poopy diapers hence why I potty train early. I have 3 children and have done this with all of them. Right after they turn 2 I take a week off of work and then my husband takes a week off of work to potty train. We use a specific method and this has worked well with all of my children. 14 days of potty training and they are good to go and have never regressed (my youngest is 3). \n\nAnyway, to the current issue. My husbands brother, his wife, and their 3 children are coming into town. There\u2019s two specific evening events they want to attend and they asked us to watch their kids. We said yes a while back so they already booked tickets to said events. One of the nights they will be out my husband will also be out so I\u2019ll have all six children. The other night my husband will be home with me. Their kids are 6, 4, and 3 for reference. It never once crossed my mind they wouldn\u2019t be potty trained. We were talking to them via FaceTime and my SIL said something to her husband about changing the 4 year olds diaper. I didn\u2019t say anything in the moment but later on that day I asked her if they were potty trained or not. She said the oldest (who has autism) is potty trained at a school but not at home and the younger two are not potty trained at all. I then told her that I was sorry but I do not change diapers after two so I would be unable to watch them. She got upset and said she has a different parenting style than me and she\u2019s going to be letting her children decide on their own when they want to give up diapers. I said that\u2019s totally fine but I personally do not change diapers past 2 and that I would be unable to watch them. My husband is willing to change their diapers on the night he will be home with me so they can still go to one of the events. My SIL is still very upset (and probably my BIL also but I haven\u2019t spoken to him) and she sent me an angry message calling me selfish. The issue is not with pee diapers but with poop diapers. I had a hard time changing my own *small* children\u2019s poopy diapers so I have no clue how I\u2019d be able to stomach 4 and 6 year olds poopy diapers. I\u2019ve apologized multiple times and said I wouldn\u2019t have agreed had I known and even offered to pay them the cost of their tickets since it\u2019s most likely too late for a refund. She\u2019s not speaking to me now and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I truly feel bad but I\u2019m also not willing to compromise on what I feel is a very reasonable boundary but alas I need the opinions of strangers because I\u2019m confused on if I was right or wrong.

I would expect a 3 year old and up to be potty trained.  She should have told you before she asked you to watch the kids.", "NTA. I would also assume at 4 and 6 that they would be potty trained. They should have explained their children's needs when asking you guys to babysit.", "NTA. You have a boundary with not changing poopy diapers. You\u2019re 100% allowed to have that boundary. I don\u2019t even think you should have to apologize for having that boundary. While that probably should\u2019ve been brought up on either side when you all agreed you\u2019ll watch the kids, it wasn\u2019t. \n\nMy experience w young kids is that they usually poop earlier or in the middle of the day. (Babies are another story). Chances are there won\u2019t be a poop to deal with at night. Which leads me to my question. This is gross, but if this event is so important, would SIL be ok if one of her kids went unchanged for a couple hours till they got home?", "NTA Two of these children are near or school aged. They should be potty trained unless wearing diapers is a medical necessity. I do not understand letting a six year old who is capable of using the restroom at school wear diapers at home.", "NTA, babysitting is one thing, but changing soiled dipers of children that old while thay ate not your children nor you are getting payed for this is gross, honestly.\nIt was their parenting style choice not to potty train, now it's up to them to take care of results", "You're NTA.  I know each child develops at his/her own rate, and what works in your home may not work for every child.

It sounds even worse for the oldest child. Doesn't he need consistency and routine even more than the younger kids?", "NTA.  These parents who don\u2019t believe in potty training are in for a world of shock when the school doesn\u2019t give the younger two a pass for being in diapers, since they don\u2019t have the \u201cspecial needs\u201d excuse.\n\nIf the 6 year old is potty trained at school, then he is able to toilet in an age appropriate manner, autism or not.\n\nIf you can\u2019t be bothered to follow through with potty training then you are a failure as a parent.  Why did these people even have kids???", "NTA  \nOutside of a health issue, or peeing the bed, there is no reason any of these kids should still wear diapers and it seems like the younger two are stunted because of the oldest one. The oldest one would be understandable if they weren't partially potty trained but  how do you potty train a child outside the home but don't apply it to inside the home?

You agreed to watch a special needs child without asking for what those special needs are and now when they are things you don\u2019t like you are backing out.\n\nYou obviously understand why your sister is upset about this.\n\nThis is not actually a boundary though.  Not changing poopy diapers after two is a parenting style and a preference.  As you said you would have potty trained them at 18 months but the daycare couldn\u2019t accommodate them.  So clearly this poppy diaper thing is not a boundary as the two year point was set by daycare and not by you.  You were willing to accommodate daycares inability to meet your boundary but not your sisters.\n\nPersonally I would just suck it up.  It\u2019s gross and disgusting but not really any worse than puke everywhere and next time ask you sister first.  I get the 4 and 6 year old is very uncommon but a 3 year old isn\u2019t that uncommon and if this was a big of boundary as you make it out to be here should have asked about the 3 year old.\n\nSo this is a preference not a boundary.  You were willing to compromise for daycare and not your sister and you didn\u2019t ask about a 3 year old being potty trained.

YTA\n\nIF being potty trained at 2 y/o is the norm, then the other parents had a responsibility to inform you that their kids weren\u2019t potty trained. It would be unreasonable for them to expect you to know this. NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing the age to potty train varies quite a bit, and neither 2 y/o nor 6 y/o is outside the norm. If this is true, then this is nothing more than a simple misunderstanding. just like it didn\u2019t occur to you that their kids might not be potty trained, it don\u2019t occur to them that you might expect their kids to be potty trained. Nobody was intentionally manipulated.\n\nSo, if nobody was in the wrong, how do we determine who should take the hit here? either the parents will have to miss out on their night, or you\u2019ll have to change some diapers.\n\nI\u2019d say it comes down to the level of responsibility. You made a commitment to watch the kids, and you have a responsibility to uphold that commitment.\n\nThe other parents birthed the kids, so they have a much larger responsibility to sacrifice their own interests in favor of what\u2019s best for their kids.\n\nBased on all this, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that (assuming 2 y/o and 6 y/o are not out of the ordinary for potty training) the parents have the ultimate responsibility here, and you are NTA for backing out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids with Autism can have interoception issues, which means they have less ability to sense what's happening in their bodies. My child on the spectrum getting stung by a bee? They did not even notice. They also were unable to notice much if the time when they needed to use the toilet until after age 5 and frequently soiled themself.

Sure, you have the right to not want to change their diapers. But given that you know the oldest child is disabled, you should have checked before agreeing to babysit. It's not at all unusual for a disabled child to be delayed in toilet training and to have an easier time toileting at school where the environment is highly organized and structured. As for the 4 year old, it's not that unusual, especially if they're a young 4 year old.", "YTA. Deep down, you know it. Rationalize all you want, but you agreed to watch them and they committed to the ticket purchase. They were also probably desperately in need of a break...having a kid with a disability is hard.\n\nYou reneged on a promise...not because you were incapable of providing the necessary care, but because you don't like it. \n\nThat's shittier than one evening of changing diapers that might not actually be poopy because there's a good chance they won't even have a bowel movement while with you.", "ESH. \n\nI don't think its intentional, but you have a specific boundary and that is fine. However you agreed to look after them and you didn't check. Sure I think its reasonable to expect them to be potty trained by 4. Yet, one of the kids is autistic so it might very well be possible they find it harder. You didn't check.\n\nSure you offered to pay for the event tickets, but the inconvenience of attending an event that is cancelled short notice isn't the ticket price. The tickets might be in high demand and being able to attend the event might be limited to once ever 5 years or at all, depending what it is.\n\nYour 'friend' sucks because she should have been clear about the requirements too. \n\nUltimately if I agreed to do something, I'd do it. Whether I liked it or not. If I had a particular hard no on something then I'd speak about it upfront instead of at the last minute.\n\nWhile it's not solely your fault and your 'friend' has a weird take on potty training for sure, I do think this is a shared issue. Though ultimately it is them that are suffering.\n\nI guess if anyone hired a babysitter, they wouldn't expect them to refuse diaper changing a 4 year old. No matter if they were 4 or 6 and that's the role you opted to take even if it is only temporary. The babysitter would have a reasonable expectation not to have to change diapers. But they would still have to do it. If it was a hard no, that is probably one of the first questions they'd ask *before* agreeing.", "ESH. \n\nIt\u2019s very concerning that their kids are not potty trained at their ages and they\u2019re absolutely doing them a disservice. It was reasonable for you to assume they wouldn\u2019t be in diapers.\n\nBut I think you should be able to suck it up for one evening. Being that you didn\u2019t know this until now, it\u2019s obviously you\u2019re not close family, so a visit from them must be rare for your kids to get to see their cousins. I assume you\u2019d be willing to help the kids if they threw up, or had an accident, or diarrhea, etc, so being ready to change one or two possible poops doesn\u2019t seem like much to get worked up over to me.\n\nI think it\u2019s AH behavior for you to renege on watching them for a few hours, knowing their parents could only go to the event because you were watching them, just because one might poop during that time.", "YTA \n\nBut if you willing to pay for tickets just get a sitter to deal with diapers. It might be helpful anyway with 6 kids.", "I would say ESH because SIL should have known you had such a bizarre and over the top reaction to poop diapers. I can\u2019t think of any mother I know  who has such an averse reaction to a normal part of raising a child. Once you have a kid and diapers become part of your life, you quickly abandon such immature behavior. I would wonder what you would\u2019ve said if only the 3yo was still in diapers. 2-3.5 is average for most kids and varies by their own anatomy, gender, etc. I know there are two other kids in this equation, but you spend so much time talking about how unusual it was for you to discover kids over 3 are still not potty trained, that it seems like your disapproval of their parenting is the main issue here. Also you know that 3 & 4 year olds don\u2019t poop like babies right? It\u2019s not blowout diarrhea. They\u2019re not shitting all night. Probably once a day. You could probably just dump the contents of the diaper directly into the toilet and they could wipe. They could probably put on their own pull up themselves.

It's more difficult for children with autism to transfer skills between settings, especially if the child is lower functioning and requires a self-contained class. At school, they usually have multiple paras, strict schedules, and specific visuals to help a child learn skills (which the school staff is ALWAYS willing to share). With potty training, they may even require sitting on the toilet at specific times every day, so they may go even though they don't feel the urge to.\n\nAnd based on the fact that the parents are letting the kids choose when to stop using diapers, they are probably not utilizing the same consistent structure as at school, so the child is not transferring those school skills to a new setting. It's VERY frustrating to be on the school side of that situation, because if the parents aren't invested, the child will likely never become fully potty trained.", "It\u2019s because the kid can get away with it.

No.", "I kinda think the 3yr old being in diapers is possible and would be something of a miscommunication, but they really should be framing it as asking to care for their 3 nibbling that are all still in diapers...as someone who provided a lot of caregiving to a lot of wonderful children, with and without needing extra assistance, and it was very important to distinguish between in and out of diapers, cuz it's extra care cuz of extra time one on one....especially when there's 3 to consider. I would be shocked and hire someone to help with that aspect, if I  wasn't up for it.", "NTA. Since I was toddler, to my son being a toddler, to now me being old enough to have grandkids, I have seen diaper use vastly expand. There are far more categories of diapers these days, all of them in bigger size ranges for older kids. This has made parents lazy (or likely it\u2019s the reverse, lazy parents demanded bigger diapers).\n\nI have watched friends\u2019 kids visit my home, then say to their mom, \u201cI\u2019m wet, where are my pull-ups?\u201d Then the kid changes his/her own pull-up. Wtf? If your kid can speak the concept so clearly then change their own pull-up/diaper, that kid is beyond old enough to be potty trained.\n\nEveryone disagreeing with you seems to assume that potty training has to be an abusive horror. My mom made it fun for me to learn (according to her, lol) as she made it an achievement, with a reward system. I did the same for my son. We made sure the experience wasn\u2019t stressful. We were understanding of accidents. \n\nThese kids are going to be bullied at school, and it\u2019s also not healthy to have diapers on so much.\n\nEdit: It would never cross my mind that kids  3, 4 and 6 wouldn\u2019t be potty trained.", "As is your absolute right.

So that leaves just the kids to take of themselves or they just wont get their diapers changed.   \n\n\n\nMom is setting them up for failure.  If mom and dad died in an accident tommorow then whose going to change the diapers?  Grandma and grandpa? You and your husband?

Do they have any interaction with other kids?  Even on play dates you would think that the 4-year-old would be teased by other kids.", "No, she is not.

And she has toilet goals in her IEP. \n\nShe\u2019s fully potty trained. She knows and can feel the cues. Asking to go to the toilet calls attention to herself and that\u2019s where the anxiety kicks in.
