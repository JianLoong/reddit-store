I would potty train earlier (18 months) but my children\u2019s daycare cannot accommodate potty trained children until they move into the 2 year old room. I strongly dislike changing poopy diapers hence why I potty train early. I have 3 children and have done this with all of them. Right after they turn 2 I take a week off of work and then my husband takes a week off of work to potty train. We use a specific method and this has worked well with all of my children. 14 days of potty training and they are good to go and have never regressed (my youngest is 3). \n\nAnyway, to the current issue. My husbands brother, his wife, and their 3 children are coming into town. There\u2019s two specific evening events they want to attend and they asked us to watch their kids. We said yes a while back so they already booked tickets to said events. One of the nights they will be out my husband will also be out so I\u2019ll have all six children. The other night my husband will be home with me. Their kids are 6, 4, and 3 for reference. It never once crossed my mind they wouldn\u2019t be potty trained. We were talking to them via FaceTime and my SIL said something to her husband about changing the 4 year olds diaper. I didn\u2019t say anything in the moment but later on that day I asked her if they were potty trained or not. She said the oldest (who has autism) is potty trained at a school but not at home and the younger two are not potty trained at all. I then told her that I was sorry but I do not change diapers after two so I would be unable to watch them. She got upset and said she has a different parenting style than me and she\u2019s going to be letting her children decide on their own when they want to give up diapers. I said that\u2019s totally fine but I personally do not change diapers past 2 and that I would be unable to watch them. My husband is willing to change their diapers on the night he will be home with me so they can still go to one of the events. My SIL is still very upset (and probably my BIL also but I haven\u2019t spoken to him) and she sent me an angry message calling me selfish. The issue is not with pee diapers but with poop diapers. I had a hard time changing my own *small* children\u2019s poopy diapers so I have no clue how I\u2019d be able to stomach 4 and 6 year olds poopy diapers. I\u2019ve apologized multiple times and said I wouldn\u2019t have agreed had I known and even offered to pay them the cost of their tickets since it\u2019s most likely too late for a refund. She\u2019s not speaking to me now and I\u2019m not sure what to do. I truly feel bad but I\u2019m also not willing to compromise on what I feel is a very reasonable boundary but alas I need the opinions of strangers because I\u2019m confused on if I was right or wrong. FWIW my husband doesn\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong and his words are \u201cthey can get over it or they can potty train their kids it\u2019s up to them\u201d.", "created_utc": 1688834642, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14u913m/aita_for_not_changing_diapers_past_2/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kindergarten is right around the corner and I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s a requirement.  I too would have expected all three children to be potty trained.  \n\nI\u2019m confused so the 6 year is potty trained and goes by themselves at school but at home wears diapers?  Wouldn\u2019t that lead to regression?", "NTA. It wouldn't occur to me either that a 4 and 6 year old weren't potty trained. Most 3 year olds are trained as well. \n\nI guess she doesn't think it's a big deal, but it's a big deal to you, (and really, it IS a big deal, period) and you aren't obligated to do it.", "NTA. I would expect a 3 year old and up to be potty trained.  She should have told you before she asked you to watch the kids.", "NTA. I would also assume at 4 and 6 that they would be potty trained. They should have explained their children's needs when asking you guys to babysit.", "NTA. You have a boundary with not changing poopy diapers. You\u2019re 100% allowed to have that boundary. I don\u2019t even think you should have to apologize for having that boundary. While that probably should\u2019ve been brought up on either side when you all agreed you\u2019ll watch the kids, it wasn\u2019t. \n\nMy experience w young kids is that they usually poop earlier or in the middle of the day. (Babies are another story). Chances are there won\u2019t be a poop to deal with at night. Which leads me to my question. This is gross, but if this event is so important, would SIL be ok if one of her kids went unchanged for a couple hours till they got home?", "NTA Two of these children are near or school aged. They should be potty trained unless wearing diapers is a medical necessity. I do not understand letting a six year old who is capable of using the restroom at school wear diapers at home.", "NTA, babysitting is one thing, but changing soiled dipers of children that old while thay ate not your children nor you are getting payed for this is gross, honestly.\nIt was their parenting style choice not to potty train, now it's up to them to take care of results", "You're NTA.  I know each child develops at his/her own rate, and what works in your home may not work for every child. My grandson was 3 before he was fully toilet trained, and it wasn't for lack if effort. **however**:\n\n>She said the oldest (who has autism) is potty trained at a school but not at home and the younger two are not potty trained at all.\n\nI'm sorry, but I'm throwing a judgment of straight up lazy parenting here. It sounds even worse for the oldest child. Doesn't he need consistency and routine even more than the younger kids?", "NTA.  These parents who don\u2019t believe in potty training are in for a world of shock when the school doesn\u2019t give the younger two a pass for being in diapers, since they don\u2019t have the \u201cspecial needs\u201d excuse.\n\nIf the 6 year old is potty trained at school, then he is able to toilet in an age appropriate manner, autism or not.\n\nIf you can\u2019t be bothered to follow through with potty training then you are a failure as a parent.  Why did these people even have kids???", "NTA  \nOutside of a health issue, or peeing the bed, there is no reason any of these kids should still wear diapers and it seems like the younger two are stunted because of the oldest one. The oldest one would be understandable if they weren't partially potty trained but  how do you potty train a child outside the home but don't apply it to inside the home? You aren't wrong BUT i will say the children are the ones who will suffer in this situation. Your husband is willing and that's fine but honestly if he's not around then what?", "[deleted]", "You agreed a while back. And they purchased tickets. It was on you at that time to get the details especially regarding care of an autistic child. You clearly know that every child has different milestones.\n\nBut it\u2019s very strange that a four year old is not potty trained at all. \n\nBecause of that ESH", "YTA. You agreed to watch a special needs child without asking for what those special needs are and now when they are things you don\u2019t like you are backing out.\n\nYou obviously understand why your sister is upset about this.\n\nThis is not actually a boundary though.  Not changing poopy diapers after two is a parenting style and a preference.  As you said you would have potty trained them at 18 months but the daycare couldn\u2019t accommodate them.  So clearly this poppy diaper thing is not a boundary as the two year point was set by daycare and not by you.  You were willing to accommodate daycares inability to meet your boundary but not your sisters.\n\nPersonally I would just suck it up.  It\u2019s gross and disgusting but not really any worse than puke everywhere and next time ask you sister first.  I get the 4 and 6 year old is very uncommon but a 3 year old isn\u2019t that uncommon and if this was a big of boundary as you make it out to be here should have asked about the 3 year old.\n\nSo this is a preference not a boundary.  You were willing to compromise for daycare and not your sister and you didn\u2019t ask about a 3 year old being potty trained.  So your the asshole for saying yea then backing out.\n\nIt\u2019s just one night.", "YTA because it\u2019s just for one night and it\u2019s for family. This would never be my hill to ruin a family relationship over BUT I would suggest seeing if there is a neighborhood teenager who babysits that you/in-laws could hire to help you for the evening and wouldn\u2019t mind doing the changing. Six kids on your own is a lot anyways and maybe everyone would appreciate the extra assistance.", "YTA... I only read  the first paragraph....anyone who feels elitist enough to think..\"i potty trained my kids before age 2, so everyone else should too, thats why its ok for kids older than two can walk around in poop and i shouldnt have to care because thier parents suck\"...thats some sick way to think and seriously F-ed up.\n\nYTA 100%....Will read the rest see if opinion changes...\n\nEdit....Still an AH... hire a babysitter to help who wont have an issue changing dipers that night.", "info: what is the average age for potty training?\n\nIF not being potty trained at 6 y/o is the norm, then you were incorrect in assuming the kids would be potty trained. also, the other parents wouldn\u2019t necessarily have any responsibility to inform you that their children aren\u2019t potty trained, because they didn\u2019t know that you had this unusual standard for potty training. YTA\n\nIF being potty trained at 2 y/o is the norm, then the other parents had a responsibility to inform you that their kids weren\u2019t potty trained. It would be unreasonable for them to expect you to know this. NTA\n\nI\u2019m guessing the age to potty train varies quite a bit, and neither 2 y/o nor 6 y/o is outside the norm. If this is true, then this is nothing more than a simple misunderstanding. just like it didn\u2019t occur to you that their kids might not be potty trained, it don\u2019t occur to them that you might expect their kids to be potty trained. Nobody was intentionally manipulated.\n\nSo, if nobody was in the wrong, how do we determine who should take the hit here? either the parents will have to miss out on their night, or you\u2019ll have to change some diapers.\n\nI\u2019d say it comes down to the level of responsibility. You made a commitment to watch the kids, and you have a responsibility to uphold that commitment.\n\nThe other parents birthed the kids, so they have a much larger responsibility to sacrifice their own interests in favor of what\u2019s best for their kids.\n\nBased on all this, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that (assuming 2 y/o and 6 y/o are not out of the ordinary for potty training) the parents have the ultimate responsibility here, and you are NTA for backing out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
