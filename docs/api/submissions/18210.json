From past experience inviting my friends and family anywhere I knew about 75% of the people invited wouldn\u2019t show from my side and my husband didn\u2019t have a lot of people coming from his either so we went for the smallest package they offered. We were allowed 25 guests not including me, husband, and officiant for 2 hours at this specific spot in the gardens for $250. The next package up was 2k for 150 people, 4 hours, reception seating, catering, and serving staff. As expected we sent out the obligatory invites and as expected only about 25% of mine rsvped. Between both sides we had exactly 25 people show up. The day was amazing and we didn\u2019t worry about any of the people who didn\u2019t show. We live streamed it via a website and on FB through our phones on tripods for the long distance family.\n\nWell fast forward to this week and the topic of weddings came up in a group chat with some of my high school friends. One of the girls was upset because she had sent out invites to her wedding (not happening til early 2024) and so far only like 40 of the 200+ invited guests have rsvped. I told her there\u2019s still time for the rest to rsvp too but she was still upset. So I told her what happened with mine and how I knew most wouldn\u2019t show and even some who had RSVPed had ended up flaking and not showing so I was glad I didn\u2019t book the ridiculously expensive package because it would have been a waste of time, food, and money. Completely forgetting that 3 of the friends in that group chat are some of the ones who rsvped but no showed. Everyone who didn\u2019t show didn\u2019t know about the cheaper option and assumed we had sprung for the $2k option so apparently they\u2019d felt guilty for the past year thinking we\u2019d wasted a ton of money bc the live stream showed what little amount of guests we had in person.\n\nThey\u2019re all mad at me for lying about the venue cost even though id never told them any details past where it was happening. They had googled it themselves to see the price points and the website didn\u2019t show the \u201celopement\u201d option that we had chosen. Idk how I\u2019m an AH for not sharing the cost of my wedding but they think I am and have been ignoring me since that conversation happened a few days ago. I don\u2019t have a ton of friends in the first place bc making friends as a special needs mom is rough and when you\u2019ve got two special needs kids it\u2019s even harder. I would hate to have some of the only friendships I still have end because of this. AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE: While responding to comments I got a fb message from a different friend and she let me know that the girls who are upset have been discussing me with an ex best friend. Ex best friend and I stopped our friendship bc she was lying to people saying I use my sons disabilities for sympathy and make it seem like he\u2019s worse off than he is so people will give me stuff and pity us. So now we\u2019re at high school level drama bc the ones who are mad now agree with ex bestie since I posted a birthday wishlist for my son a couple days ago. He\u2019s turning 10 on Sunday and within the next month will be having one of two amputation surgeries so the wishlist has birthday gift ideas and surgery recovery stuff on it and I only posted it bc my family asked me to share it so they could send him presents. I have now blocked those girls on everything and realize I should have ended those friendships a long time ago. I\u2019d rather be lonely than deal with their BS. I wish my son hadnt had such a hard life but I have done everything I can for him to have everything he needs but never expected this craziness. He\u2019s had 20+ surgeries and has multiple disabilities which have caused the surgeries.

When something you believed was true for a long time turns out to be false it can cause uncomfortable feelings, so I understand their initial sense of \u201cbetrayal\u201d but they only did that to themselves.

I suggest you reach out and say you don\u2019t have any negative feelings towards them (unless you do) and that you were just being practical.
