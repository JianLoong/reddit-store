Greg has a home that is across the street from me diagonally and has a driveway with three spaces, and lives alone.

He took the canopy camper somewhere this weekend, a first since I have lived here. \n\nGreg also has 2 other cars, a tan sedan and a silver SUV. Between all of these, he has 3 license plates. Two plates match but have expired tags, and are currently on the sedan (yes, currently), and the SUV has a single plate on the back, with no tags at all (he has peeled them off), he moves the plates around depending on what he is driving.

However not this weekend.\n\nI am redoing my front yard, and he left the tan sedan in front of my house all weekend. No one was parked in front of his house. If you park in front of his house, he runs out wearing a body cam around his neck and yells at you until you move, even if other street spaces are full. This is just a normal neighborhood with sidewalks. Also, unless he is loading or unloading something, he never parks in front of his own house, as it \"ruins his view\" say the neighbors. Once he has loaded or unloaded, he parks in front of someone else's house.\n\nNormally I ignore the guy, but his car was in the way all weekend.

He lived diagnolly from us yet would park in front of our house for no apprent reason (his driveway was clear as day). He didn't maintain his yard yet would move around the toddler toys in the yard (his children were adults) for whatever reason. Anytime anyone parked in front of his house he would freak the fuck out. Just recently my mom went to ask him why he doesn't park in his driveway and he just randomly went off on her about the upkeep of his yard (which she didn't even mention...). He told her to fuck herself and proceeded to get in his car and speed off like a maniac. Some people just aren't right.", "YWNBTA, because it\u2019s clear he takes advantage of the neighborhood. He\u2019s doing all of this because he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever get caught.

Don't start a fight with this guy. His shit will catch up to him without your help.", "Oh, if anyone calls him out on anything, he runs inside and gets his body cam on, then runs out and starts yelling at you and flipping you off and saying how awful you are. There is a rental sort of across the street from him, and he tells people whenever they move in they cannot park in the street because has has lived here so long and those are his spaces.", "Also, when I first moved in, he tried selling me a dialysis machine. He said he had two of them. I did not ask follow up questions.", "Since I have been here the police have come to talk to Greg three times that I know of. One time was when he tried putting his own handicap parking space in front of his house and was told to remove it. He does not have a handicap parking permit, so he would not even be able to use it, if it were legal to install a random handicap parking spot anyway.", "I watched him go yell at concrete workers across the street who were being too noisy. 4 jacked pacific islanders. They were super nice when I talked to them, but you could tell after a few minutes that it was about to be bad for Greg.", "Normally I would agree. The WORST that happens here is that he has to go to the DMV like the rest of us and register his cars. This is a \"fixit ticket\" in my state. The fines go away once he registers the cars.", "Yep, sounds about right for this type of person. If enough people make a fuss with the city, you may have some headway but you also have to weigh the possibility of him doing something dangerously unhinged. My parents always wanted to do something about him but feared the retaliation because they had kids in the home, and now his new neighbors have the same predicament (they have young children)", "Yeah, it's probably for the best to just call the cops on Greg", "Doesn\u2019t matter.", "Oh, I am very worried about him doing something. I am thinking of doing something petty, like making him actually register his vehicles like everyone else. Literally the worst outcome for him is he as to go to the DMV like the rest of us and pay $200 a car for 4 years.  I am worried he will come over and scratch up my or my wife's car, at a minimum.\n\nSide note, he tried selling me a dialysis machine one time when I first moved in. I did not ask follow-up questions.", "The best thing you can do is get (if you don't already have one) a security camera on your cars, along with front/back dash cams. Even if you report him anonymously, he may just take his anger out on *all* his surrounding neighbors as a result. Better to prepare yourself.", "I have my cars on two different cameras, mostly because of this one guy.", "If he doesn\u2019t have legal plates.  , he doesn\u2019t have car insurance.  He could crash into your car and not pay for your repairs. \n\nProtect your self and your neighbors. \n\nYou pay for your car insurance. \n\nYou pay for your car taxes. \n\nYou pay for your trailer plates and insurance. \n\nYou mow your yard but code enforcement doesn\u2019t give him a citation. \n\nHe cheats and he screams.  He needs a good spanking. Call today and every day.  Or put an ad in Craigslist for free stuff at his address.  It is an option.", "NTA- i would have already called and reported for that tag nonsense.", "This story makes me want to punch myself in both eyes.", "NTA\n\nGlass houses. He's about to find out what stones can do to it.", "YWNBTA call the cops !!! Get this creep. He\u2019s a menace to your neighborhood!", "NTA and I would love updates on this", "YWNBTA  guy wants to be an asshole, make him pay the asshole tax.\n\nThe city might also give him fines for having unlicensed vehicles on his property.", "YWNBTA.  Just call and tell them what he\u2019s doing with the vehicles and ask them to tow the vehicle in front of your house.\nBonus points for giving them any video you have of him swapping plates to drive different vehicles.", "So you think YTA for following the law. And not letting your kindness take over. You are NTA", "If it was me, I wouldn't call the police on him. I'd just tell him not to park in front of my house. Running to the police without talking to the guy first and giving him a chance to correct his behaviour would make you the AH in my opinion.", "But honestly I would wait and do it when you're going out of town for a couple days OP. Just from your replies Greg sounds like he's dangerously unhinged.", "He has on numerous occasions bragged to neighbors about not having insurance and how he can just move plates to avoid paying fees.", "Did you read my additional information?", "Sadly they just come put a green sticker on your window saying you have 3 days to move it and a ticket, at least for the tan sedan. The silver suv is another story. It has a plate on it with no tags, that actually belongs to the truck.", "I don't think ITAH for following the law, it's more that I am just being petty by making him do what the rest of us do. In my state this is a fixit ticket. He will just have to go to the DMV like the rest of us and the fine is gone.", "Why are you waiting to call? NTA", "So the jerk neighbor should be allowed to be extremely illegal? Makes sense.", "You have cameras. Don\u2019t be afraid!", "It\u2019s not your business to go around reporting every petty thing to the cops.", "This is not petty- it is illegal. Yeah, the government might not really need the money, but having plates and stuff is required for many reasons. If he doesn't have plates, who's to say he isn't doing something nefarious with those cars because he can't be tracked?\n\nPetty would be the fence is too high or the pool is too big or something like that. This is issues with multiple government agencies. The guy is also a jerk, so he will only get what he deserves."]}
