And wow can't believe your son woke up your daughter to make her cook for him.... I'm very glad you are addressing this.\n\nBut if he's desperately unhappy AND everyone involved feels like he has sufficiently learned his lesson, perhaps you could call a Parole Board meeting, and ask your daughter what she thinks. Is there an alternate way your son can continue his sentence? Is there another way for him to make amends? What does your spouse think and what does your daughter think? \n\n(Maybe ask your son, too, what he could do instead of making the same number of meals - his answer would be very enlightening.  Because if he suggests some fluff offering then clearly he hasn't learned, but if he is serious about being sorry his alternate suggestion should be a good one).\n\nI think you are NTA for having your son face consequences, but you would be T A if you are overly rigid and refuse to reconsider your decisions in the face of all opposition.", "He had a choice.

When is a person younger, he can stay up to late, many of us experienced night gaming sessions or such things and went next day to school perfectly fine. It's pretty original way of punishment and for sure educational for him.   \n\n\nAlso I have no idea what lives do have people telling you YTA, but at 17 I've been perfectly fine cooking for myself or from time to time even for family. It's basic skill good into life (of course it's better when you like it as I do, but that's different story). So waking up his sister to make him food is just a jerk move.

Why was he not being woken up to feed children in your family (his or not)!? Why was he not doing his part to teach a teenage child how to cook for himself (whether they were his or not)!? Why did he let your daughter get woken up 30 times, before you found out, to help her, and then agree with that the punishment fit the crime!? Where. Was. Your. Husband?

Plus who thinks super clearly after being woken like that?  Add into that their usual sibling dynamics, and I don't blame her at all.\n\n>Daughter is 21 .... just kick him out & lock the damn door.

In his case, at least 1) in terms of him not knowing how to comfortably put together a meal: when people were trying to teach him during adolescence, he\u2019d basically tantrum or refuse to go into the kitchen to help/learn. The people trying to teach him could either delay making the meal (which means other people having to wait too) for some extended period of time to try to convince/argue with him or try dragging him into the kitchen which only really results in him being a sullen asshat in the kitchen and being as willfully incompetent as possible for a while and sometimes just leaving mid prep which essentially means the whole nonsense starts again and 2) not all people have door they can close or lock and even so, there are AHs who will knock and yell and kick and make noise to keep you from sleeping until you get up.

School is NOT THAT important, despite what many teachers think. There are crucial lessons which are absolutely necessary to get through. Like, I don't know, that your sister (or women, or other people in general) are not your servants. And disturbing someone's sleep to cater to your whims is rather unpleasant for the abused person.

This kid is a year away from being able to go off and live on his own. He will be losing sleep for all sorts of reasons, both fun and not so fun. This is a valuable opportunity to show him the natural consequences of his action. And to choose wisely when given the chance.
