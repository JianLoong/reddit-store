And he's been given agency here, he chose to keep his phone over uninterrupted sleep. Well done, OP.", "NTA. But make the rest of the meals happen on weekends due to his schooling.", "NTA he just needs to adjust his bedtime to an hour or two earlier to make up for the missed sleep in the middle of the night.

And wow can't believe your son woke up your daughter to make her cook for him.... I'm very glad you are addressing this.\n\nBut if he's desperately unhappy AND everyone involved feels like he has sufficiently learned his lesson, perhaps you could call a Parole Board meeting, and ask your daughter what she thinks. Is there an alternate way your son can continue his sentence? Is there another way for him to make amends? What does your spouse think and what does your daughter think? \n\n(Maybe ask your son, too, what he could do instead of making the same number of meals - his answer would be very enlightening.  Because if he suggests some fluff offering then clearly he hasn't learned, but if he is serious about being sorry his alternate suggestion should be a good one).\n\nI think you are NTA for having your son face consequences, but you would be T A if you are overly rigid and refuse to reconsider your decisions in the face of all opposition.", "He had a choice.

When is a person younger, he can stay up to late, many of us experienced night gaming sessions or such things and went next day to school perfectly fine. It's pretty original way of punishment and for sure educational for him.   \n\n\nAlso I have no idea what lives do have people telling you YTA, but at 17 I've been perfectly fine cooking for myself or from time to time even for family. It's basic skill good into life (of course it's better when you like it as I do, but that's different story). So waking up his sister to make him food is just a jerk move.

Why was he not being woken up to feed children in your family (his or not)!? Why was he not doing his part to teach a teenage child how to cook for himself (whether they were his or not)!? Why did he let your daughter get woken up 30 times, before you found out, to help her, and then agree with that the punishment fit the crime!? Where. Was. Your. Husband?

In his case, at least 1) in terms of him not knowing how to comfortably put together a meal: when people were trying to teach him during adolescence, he\u2019d basically tantrum or refuse to go into the kitchen to help/learn. The people trying to teach him could either delay making the meal (which means other people having to wait too) for some extended period of time to try to convince/argue with him or try dragging him into the kitchen which only really results in him being a sullen asshat in the kitchen and being as willfully incompetent as possible for a while and sometimes just leaving mid prep which essentially means the whole nonsense starts again and 2) not all people have door they can close or lock and even so, there are AHs who will knock and yell and kick and make noise to keep you from sleeping until you get up.

School is NOT THAT important, despite what many teachers think. There are crucial lessons which are absolutely necessary to get through. Like, I don't know, that your sister (or women, or other people in general) are not your servants. And disturbing someone's sleep to cater to your whims is rather unpleasant for the abused person.

Or that the whole family had to share one.  And that they could only make calls.  Then when the internet started, you also had to share the phone with being online!", "See I think this is a way more appropriate response than blow up first try. Like I hope my children are kind and helpful eachother out even when inconvenient but are capable of also setting boundaries with each other and won't exploit eachother and I'm a firm believer in first times a mistake, second time is because change isn't instant, but by the third time it's deliberate. \n\nBut 30 times is nuts. I will say I get the point in making your son follow a punishment that actually forces him to face his actions, but don't forget the basic statement of an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. You want to punish him and ensure he understands, but at a certain point it does become being vindictive with him rather than being a good parent.\n\nYou mentioned you believe he understands what he did is wrong, and so at the point of he understands what he did and won't do it again, you have stopped teaching the lesson that he should be way more respectful of his sister and are instead teaching him punishment should simply be an eye for an eye regardless of if the message is hit home or not. \n\nSo you've nailed the punishment fits the crime in the sense that you are actually showing him the error of his ways, but are now failing in teaching your children to not be vindictive when wronged and to not forgive until all aspects of the way they are wronged have been righted in their entirety. I wouldn't say you are an asshole or anything for following through on the punishment you set forth and everyone agreed upon at all, but you may want to re-evaluate what you are teaching your children at this point.\n\nOnly you can decide what you think is more important to teach your children though. That your son should have to see through the punishment for his actions because you said it was what the punishment was going to be, or if you want to teach them that they should try to fix the issues they cause, but that it is also important to forgive each other for making mistakes as long as the lesson has been learned. \n\nEach is valid, and you are their parent, your mother is not so you do not need to consider what she thinks in your choice.\n\nIn my opinion though, remember even prison grants parole for good behavior, and that doesn't even require them learning their lesson.", "Mine is 11.

The punishment fits, and he chose it, but if the sister keeps waking him up as revenge, then things might get too heated and end up being an even bigger headache for you.
