I'm very glad you are addressing this.\n\nBut if he's desperately unhappy AND everyone involved feels like he has sufficiently learned his lesson, perhaps you could call a Parole Board meeting, and ask your daughter what she thinks. Is there an alternate way your son can continue his sentence? Is there another way for him to make amends? What does your spouse think and what does your daughter think? \n\n(Maybe ask your son, too, what he could do instead of making the same number of meals - his answer would be very enlightening.

He need to suffer just as much as what he did otherwise he can't learn attitude it pretty toxic. If he break the leg of something in a car accident should the punishment would be for him to have his leg broken? It's more accurate now that he have a broken leg.\n\nBut it doesn't matter, because school is obligatory by law and if the lack of sleep is noticed at school and they start to ask questions, it could escalade more than the parent want it to be.", "It takes a week to make up for ONE night of missed sleep. Kid is supposed to make up for 30 missed nights of sleep during the school year? That's a semester down the drain. There's no way this will not hurt his performance at school, and high school performance matters.   \n\n\nThe first weeks of school do matter. This is high school not elementary school. Kids are learning every teacher's expectations and getting a jump on studying for later tests. What person thinks school only matters on test days? You have to be able to learn adequately in all of the days leading up to those test days in order to test well....  \n\n\nThere's absolutely no reason why a good parent could not complete the punishment on weekends and still make sure he's able to perform well in school.", "Really. A 17 year old can make a sandwich. Mom doesn\u2019t need to have a crock pot going each day, that\u2019s ridiculous", "I deal with insomnia. I also flat out missed a whole month of my senior year due to illness. \n\nIf he fails because of a couple weeks, there\u2019s more going on.", "One is 14 days left, not 30. Two it the beginning of the year it won\u2019t fuck him up. Kids go to school tired all the time, and if he doesn\u2019t want to then he can go to sleep earlier. That wouldn\u2019t be hard to do. \n\nOr just drink some caffeine or take a now after school. The kid will be fine.\n\nMaking food takes 30 minutes, he can go back to sleep. 30 minutes less isn\u2019t a huge deal. Also he chose this.", "You're assuming she has the materials to make a sandwich available to him... It's her job to make sure he has food available that HE can use without help. Setting up a crock pot meal takes 15-30 mins and feeds everyone.", "The entire punishment is 30 days. Meaning at the end he will have 30 days of missed to sleep to make up for the rest of the semester. \n\nYou're assuming he can get back to sleep in seconds, not everyone can. Most people take awhile.\n\nKids flunk drop out of high school all the time, what's your point? Does that validate the parent causing it?", "I\u2019m sure OPS fridge has food, especially if his sister could make food. He\u2019s 17 not 7. He doesn\u2019t need mom to make him food.", "He already did half the punishment before school started it\u2019s 14 days left. The kid is 17 not 7 he will be fine.\n\nHighly doubt the kid would drop out over two week of being tired and he is still a minor. You really think OP would let him. He may be legally allowed but that doesn\u2019t mean much when you live at home"]}
