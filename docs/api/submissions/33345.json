{"id": 33345, "submission_id": "18ltd7j", "title": "AITA for being ungrateful about a gift that I hated, even though I know they worked hard on it?", "selftext": "I have a small group of online friends who met because of a particular fandom. This year, we decided to do a secret santa fanfic exchange. We each wrote a brief prompt of the kind of story we'd like, the characters to be involved, etc. We also included (and this is the important part) the things we would NOT want in the story. We picked names, secret santa style, and each wrote a gift fic based on the prompts. We wrote the stories over the past couple months, and then this weekend, we exchanged them.\n\nSarah is the one who chose my name and wrote a story for me. While she did follow the prompts that I requested, she also included every single thing that I included on my \"do not want\" list. It's not even like the list was miles long or over the top. The three things I didn't want in the story were any references to cheating, BDSM, or noncon. It was a story about a freaking coffee shop, and she managed to squeeze all three of them in there.\n\nWe sent each other the stories on Friday evening, and then we had the weekend to read them over before we had a little Christmas party yesterday. It was supposed to be a chance to share the stories with the group, talk about our favorite parts, and generally just be thrilled to get a personally written story.  Everyone else loved their gifts, but I was obviously pretty quiet about mine. I thanked Sarah and said that it was very well written (which it admittedly was) but that was pretty much all I said. She was a little put out and kept pushing me to talk more about it and tell everyone what I liked. I finally snapped and told her that she literally ignored what I asked for, wrote the story that SHE wanted, not what I wanted, and that I'm actually not all that grateful for it because it was honestly difficult to get through when it included so many things that I actively don't enjoy reading.\n\nShe got mad, said that she included those things because they made sense with the way she views the characters, and that I should be grateful that she put so much effort in- it was the longest story written by any of us in the exchange. It got kind of heated, so we all just agreed to end the party early and log off. I haven't spoken to Sarah since, but another friend in the group told me that she's pretty upset about the whole thing. Awesome- so am I. I feel like she's expecting me to reach out to apologize, but I feel like she's the one in the wrong here.

You explicitly stated that you did not want those in the story. That was a boundary list, and she crossed it. It doesn\u2019t matter how hard she worked on it, she *knew* that those were hard no\u2019s and she wrote that entire thing knowing that, and still opted to add them.", "I\u2019d say NTA. You thanked Sara and said it was very well written and done. But you said she wasn\u2019t happy and kept pushing you to say the things you liked. She wanted praise and glowing examples . Don\u2019t ask the question if you can\u2019t handle the answer. Everything you said to her was true and it wouldn\u2019t have been said if she\u2019d been content with well written.", "In school missing the topic is a F, it doesn't matter how long or well writen a story ist.", "NTA. It\u2019s like telling everyone I do not want something the is explicitly triggering to me and they only pick triggering items. She does not deserve an apology.", "NTA. She explicitly violated very specific boundaries that you had. Tbh it doesn't matter how much effort she put into it, if she's including things you specifically asked her not to. ESPECIALLY when those things are sexually related. Consent is essential and doesn't only apply to physical situations.", "First of all, this is the best Secret Santa idea for fanfiction writers and well done to whoever suggested it!\n\nIf the agreement between all of you was to honour the requests of things to not include, then it is completely reasonable for you to be upset that Sarah included all of them anyway. As you said, it's not a gift for you at that point.\n\nYou don't have to appreciate gifts that explicitly violate your stated boundaries. You don't have to be grateful for such.\n\nYou are allowed to say: \"I explicitly requested my story not contain non con, BDSM and cheating. This story has all three, so it's not a story that works for me. It's really well written and I can see how much time and effort Sarah put into it. If you're okay with these themes you might also enjoy reading it.\"\n\nIdeally Sarah will apologise for not listening to your boundaries. However, it's possible that she has invested too much of her ego into the story and that your rejection of it feels like a rejection of her. It takes time and experience (including experience of rejections) to learn how to separate one's ego from one's work. This doesn't excuse her behaviour but it might help explain it a little.\n\nAt the same time, learning how to accept even unwanted gifts with grace can make co-existing with others easier. Finding something you appreciate in Sarah's gift might make it easier to help you help smooth things over if you want to do that. For example, was the opening powerful? Were any of the lines clever enough for you to remember them now? Being able to point to something good can take the sting out of rejection.\n\nMaybe something like the below might help.\n\n\"You are a really good writer, and I really loved this particular bit [example]. I know you put a lot of effort into writing this piece for me. I tried to not make a fuss about you ignoring my requests, but you insisted on public feedback on something I'd rather have not read. I know what I said came across as mean. I'm sorry for that, I know how much it hurts to have your careful work criticised. I'm still hurt that I explicitly asked for none of these themes to be included and you put them in anyway. I would like to move past this, are you able to apologise for not taking my boundaries seriously?\"\n\nNTA", "NTA. you guys had a \"do not include\" list for a reason. You asked for 3 things to not be included and she couldn't do that. Fuck Sarah. Blast her for this in your group.", "NTA unless there is any chance the things you had on your \u2018do not include\u2019 list showed up for her on a \u2018please include\u2019 list.\n\n\u201cI should be grateful that she put so much effort in.\u201d Yeah nah, that\u2019s not how it works if she\u2019s going to ignore the rules of the exchange and include topics that could be triggering for you.", "NTA. If the deal was you were all supposed to be riding stories FOR each other, its pretty selfish of her to ignore that and just write one for herself.", "NTA.  You might have been a little more diplomatic by saying parts of it were hard to read due to the content, but Sarah sounds like she\u2019s a bit up her own ass.  She just HAD to include the three things you specifically asked her not to include, because \u201cthat\u2019s how she views the characters\u201d?  Nonsense.  This is fanfic and you are already pulling the characters out of their context and sticking them in a coffee shop.  I don\u2019t care if she was writing about Pinhead from Hellraiser, it\u2019s very easy to just\u2026..not write that shit.  This was meant to be a story for you and she ignored your requests, then pushed you for more praise when you tried to be nice about it.  Snapping at her was a bit much but I still don\u2019t think you are the AH.", "Any gift that you know in advance the receiver don't want is not a gift, it's at the best case nuisance. \n\nIf she couldn't wrote her story with those things, she should've write a different story. NTA", "NTA  \nIn what world would it be okay to give someone something they straight up say they hate/do not want. \n\nShe is very clearly in the wrong. In what world isn't she in the wrong? It is like she made you dish with a food you hated and expected you to sing praises about a dish you did not order.", "NTA. It's vaguely ironic, really.  One of the biggest rules in the BDSM community is always ask for consent, obey safe words and generally don't push people to do things that they don't ask for/enjoy. Especially when it's already been established that the person isn't into it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, clearly, \"Sarah\" knows as little about BDSM as she does about about fanfic, secret santa, or being a good friend.", "She must be a narcissist.", "NTA. It's just as you said, instead of writing a story for you, she wrote one for herself. You explicitly said you didn't want those themes and she included them because she likes them. You even tried to be polite by not bringing it up but she insisted on pushing it. She was inconsiderate and she should be the one apologizing.", "NTA.  Sarah didn't follow the rules that everyone else did.  You asked specifically for 3 things not to be included and instead, she included all of them.  The story wasn't supposed to be how she viewed them.  It was supposed to be how you viewed them.  You thanked her for her effort and told her it was well written.  She shouldn't be expecting an apology if she's not giving one to you.", "NTA\n\nSarah is a riot. Imagine you had a more typical secret Santa and you said: \nLikes: fancy soap\nDislikes: alcohol (I don\u2019t drink) \n\nAnd she gave you a bottle of gin because she thinks it\u2019s an appropriate adult Christmas present and she loves it \nAnd then she asked you in front of everyone how much you enjoyed your gift \n\nHaha what a melon \n\nDon\u2019t apologise, you were trying to be polite and she should have taken the hint.
