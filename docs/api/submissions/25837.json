This all could have been avoided if they done that before booking anything.\n\nYes, it's your mums house, but as you said, it will fall to you. Even BILs offer of you staying at theirs benefits them cos you'll be effectively house sitting. But the question wasn't asked to you, and if you weren't happy, you should have spoken to your mum about it privately.\n\nIf your mum doesn't want all 3, then she needs to say so. She has her own life and plans, and they don't come after your sisters and BIL.", "NTA\n\nFk that guy.  5 days is a HUGE ask for one kid.  Its unreasonably large an ask for 3 kids.", "Once it clicked in that you were the majority caregiver, he offered you his place to be peaceful.

If your Mom wants her Grandkids to stay over a few days who are you to object what she is doing in her house? He'll, you didn't even let your mother answer the question herself, you just jumped right there into her business.\n\nBiL even offered you another place to stay if the kids were to much for you. \n\nYTA for disrespecting your Mom\nYTA for being rude to your BIL\nYTA for misleading title since no one really asked you anything", "NTA my man, yes he was asking your mum and it's her house... But knowing full well how it'll end up with you long after them the vast majority of the time and not really allowing you to do anything you want or get proper sleep in your own bed you're well within your right to say no", "YTA. This is between your sister and your mom. \n\nThe kids don't get to 'insist' that they spend the whole time with you, you can say no. If they throw a tantrum, well, that's your mom's problem to deal with as their babysitter. If you think she'll force them on you, then take your BIL up on the offer to stay at their house instead. They gave you an out, you really don't have a leg to stand on here.", "YTA mum and BIL are correct. Why are you letting the little kids be the boss of you? I wouldn\u2019t even let my own kid sleep in my bed, let alone someone else\u2019s, no matter how much they insisted. It\u2019s not good to give in to tantrums.", "YTA. Its not your house and they weren't asking you. \n\nI agree 5 days is a massive ask, I personally wouldn't have my nieces and nephews for that long, but ultimately it's not your home, your mum can say no if she doesn't want to help. \n\nAs for the kids being all over you- you'll have to put your foot down at some point. And I have a toddler, I know how clingy they can be. Or go and stay at their home and let your mum deal with the kids, which is what she would be doing if you weren't there- if she agrees to looking after them.", "NTA. You live there, you get a say. He wants to dump his parental responsibility to go on holiday, he does not get a say. His kids are so attached to you it's pretty clear that you're spending a lot of time with them already, so he's already not pulling his weight.\n\nYou don't get to dictate what other people do when asking for massive favours. If he can't deal with the terms you *and* your mother prefer then he's SOOL.", "YTA. They weren't asking you, they were asking your mom. Somehow you got the idea that asking your mom meant asking you, and started interjecting. Your BIL was actually gracious to offer for you to move into their place temporarily.", "YTA.\n\nHe asked your mother, not you. If your mother makes you look after the kids when she's the one who agreed to babysit, then it's a problem between you and her.\n\nYour BIL was even mature enough to offer you their own place for the 5 days so you wouldn't be bothered by his kids. \n\nYou should have keep your mouth shut and let your mother answer the question that was meants for her.", "YTA. He was not talking to you. Move and stay in BILs house, if 5 days with the kids is too much.", "YTA. Your mum will be babysitting four people by the sounds of it. Grow the fuck up.", "YTA he didn't ask you, it's not your house, if you don't like it leave, if your mom doesn't like it she can stick up for herself.", "Jesus christ. Yea YTA. Firstly they literally didn't ask you to babysit them she asked your mother and even offered an alternative to you not wanting to be around for your nephew and nieces. This is incredibly entitled behaviour. This isn't all about you and frankly actually has nothing to do with you. Your sister has 3 kids she deserves a break every so often and you can't be supportive for 5 days? Seriously? Your mother is right, she's clearly OK with sacrificing some brief social time for her family even if you are not. In short your complaining about having to do something you weren't asked to do and acting like someone's thrown a live bomb into your lap. Grow up.", "YTA while I would also be triggered by my BIL saying that, he\u2019s right and you started it.", "No one is the A here. All have valid arguments. Your BIL gave you an alternative solution...so now is up to your mother", "NTA\n\n Since it's mom's house, and her decision, let her watch the kids.

He offered him his own house to stay in if it was going to be that much of an issue.

Go for walks or jogs, run errands, hang out with friends, maybe even take up BIL on his offer of their house. Be the fun uncle who pops in and out. Let grandma manage by herself.

He wasn't asked in the first place, it's not his house they are leaving their children at and despite this they offered him somewhere else to stay when he rudely refused to do something he wasn't asked to do. They treated this situation politely He treated it like a child.", "Because everybody involved knows that it's the OP who's going to be doing the actual work, and BiL got all pissy when the OP suggested an improvement to the plan that would be less of an imposition.", "Well he claims that he would be doing all of the work but that still doesn't change the fact that he wasn't actually under any obligation to do so and again was provided with an alternative when his objections were made. Had he been the one originally asked then I would agree that the brother in laws reaction is \"pissy\" but to me it didn't seem like a particularly unreasonable response to say that it's the mother's house as that is literally the case here."]}
