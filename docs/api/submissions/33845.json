Times have been tight for us the last few months. Our bills are paid, but we have essentially no discretionary income, and that means that Christmas presents were pretty much off the table. This is the first Christmas where this has been the case, and my wife and I have been pretty sad. Our son is aware of this, and being an empathetic kid, was accepting of the situation. He\u2019s also lucky in that I have a few wealthy relatives that give him money for Christmas each year.\n\nSo, Christmas morning comes around, and our son comes in and gives us each a card. We smile and open them, and in each card is $100. It almost brought me to tears. He used his own Christmas money to give us a gift, even though we couldn\u2019t give him anything.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m torn. I got up, gave him a hug, thanked him, and then gave the money back. I told him that he will NEVER have to give us money. My personal feeling is that gifts of money go DOWN generations, or sideways, but never UP. I absolutely do not want either of my children giving me money, and would never ask. It just seems wrong to me.\n\nHe seemed a bit disappointed. I took the cards and put them up on the mantle over the fireplace, and made a big deal over how much we liked them, but I refused the money, told him to keep it and buy himself something nice with it.\n\nAm I the Asshole for refusing this gift?\n\n\nETA: Many here have suggested that I let him treat us all to a nice dinner. I\u2019ve just spoken to him, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do! Thank you so much for your feedback and kind words. I especially appreciate the Y T A votes that included positive feedback and advice!

You don\u2019t get to dictate who someone else - including your son - gifts money to. \n\nAll you did was show him that you\u2019re ungrateful. I know that wasn\u2019t your intention at all, but that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to come across to him. \n\nHe was being kind and thoughtful, and you kicked him in the teeth for it.", "NAH. And what a wonderful son you raised!", "NAH. Your son did a beautiful thing. And you handled it very gracefully.", "NTA.", "YTA Your son did a great thing and you ruined it.  \n\nI think your wrong with your thinking gifts should go up and down, it shows caring and love.", "NAH, and you raised a fine son. Reminds me of my one Uncle gifting me money as a kid (tween or a few years younger), and I got excited to buy gifts for others so I could see the excitement on their faces. But my parents said to use it for myself to buy my own gifts. \n\nTell your son that sometimes Christmases are mainly for kids. He means well and probably did more than other kids would do his age, giving up his own wants and needs at the appropriate holiday in order to help his parents out. I mean, how else could you get nominated for a \"kid of the year\" award?", "NAH, but perhaps you might have accepted his gracious gift and then used it to go out to dinner or take him to a movie/sporting event.\n\nTalk to your son & fully explain your feelings and reaction so this isn't a sore point between you.", "NAH\n\nThis sub is filled with bad and entitled parents. You are not one of them. You're taking the role of provider seriously and based on your son's actions on Christmas you've done a good job raising him. \n\nThat being said I think you took the wrong approach here. You obviously mean a lot to your son and he wanted to express his appreciation and it's easy to understand why he would be upset at your refusal. Instead of outright refusing the money, does your son have a favorite restaurant, an upcoming movie he's looking forward to, or some kind of hobby you both share? If so spend the gift card money on a nice family outing centered around one of those. Instead of a holiday season you remember for difficulties and disappointment, it can be a happy memory of the whole family coming together for something nice", "I would not call you an AH, but this was a big deal to him, say thank you and buy something nice and or needed. That\u2019s the Christmas spirit.", "My 13 yr old son used his gift cards from his grandparents to buy me a bar of men\u2019s soap on Amazon. He paid $15 for shipping so it would get here in time too. This kid is such a treasure. I\u2019m a lucky mom.", "Um, yeah, YTA. \n\nSounds like you raised a good kid who wants to look after his parents. Maybe apologise to him for throwing his generous gift back in his face (metaphorically speaking).\n\nYou should also try to get over this prideful \"I'll never accept money from my kids\" shit & learn to be grateful.", "Soft YTA. Buying things for my parents brings me a ton of joy - I am now much more financially stable than they are and being able to show them some care and love is very meaningful to me. I know they sacrificed a lot for me and they were always very generous with gifts even when the budget was tight, and it is important to me to be able to do the same for them. Personally, in this situation I wouldn\u2019t have given cash - I would have gotten gift cards to a favorite place or something I knew they wanted or needed. But your son was trying to love you.", "NTA - one father to another, you made the right call", "NAH. \n\nBut your son, at 18, was grown enough to be selfless and you should be very proud of him for it. He could have been like any other teenager and spent his money on himself and instead he wanted to give it to you. You raised a good kid.", "Take the softest and gentlest YTA I have to offer. You are blessed with a loving, thoughtful, generous son. I imagine a lot of scrimping and saving went into that gift, and he was very proud of himself \u2014 and a little crushed when you turned it down.\n\nInstead of refusing the gift, it might have been kinder for you and your wife to forget your pride and use the money for a Christmas treat for the three of you\u2026dinner and a movie, or something else you\u2019ve had to forgo lately due to finances.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from, but he did buy you gift cards because he wanted to. As a parent, it must be super difficult to be in your position. Maybe suggest that you use the gift card to do something together? That way you\u2019re accepting, but also making it about your relationship.", "NAH, but like, you should let him do something for you. He's becoming a man and is trying to shoulder more responsibility. I get that, in your eyes, he's still the kid whose diapers/nappies you changed, but that's obviously not how he sees himself. While trying to do right by him, be careful not to stop him from becoming who and what he wants to be.", "What a sweet and caring young man you\u2019ve raised. I cannot give a judgement but agree with many of the comments that you could have gratefully accepted and used the money to treat the family to some indulgence (going out to eat, etc.) you\u2019ve had to forego due to financial hardship.", "NTA,\n\nI'm 40s myself and also have an 18yr old, this year he gifted me a bag of jellies and a lottery card.. now getting the lottery card I already knew, if I won any amount whether small or substantial..  it was going to him..\n\nI agree with you.. Money goes sideways and down, never up..", "NTA. Christmas has been hard for many of us this year. I purchased modest gifts for my grandchildren, but nothing for any of my adult children. They did not buy me gifts (although one gave me some chocolates). It's not feasible to spend money on frivolities when you are struggling to pay for essentials.", "It can be a gift to let others have the joy of giving.", "NAH\n\nIt was a lovely gesture and I understand why you felt you couldn\u2019t accept it. Perhaps your son could use the money for a family treat you can all enjoy", "NTA\n\nOMG I'm in TEARS! What a fine young man you have raised, so empathic and considerate and aware of everyone's needs. This is so mature and noble i am quite impressed. I would approach him and say something more like as a parent it's quite difficult and embarrasing perhaps to accept this money, not that you didn't appreciate it or value the gesture. It is important that you express clearly why you did't accept it because definitely he's a bit unaware and sad. Maybe it's a nice time to see what all of you needed for home, like a fan, heater etc.. you get the point. That will make him feel validated and all of you so proud. But NTA for not accepting, totally understandable from my point of view (as a parent).", "I little bit YTA-  this isn\u2019t a baby this is another almost adult.   He knew you were have a tough year and did something nice. \n\nPart of raising kids is modeling both giving and receiving kindness.", "It was my 40th birthday on the 26th.  My 3 kids (17, 13, and 9) (and I assume my ex husband helped) put their money together and got me an absolutely beautiful personalised wooden music box, with their names engraved on it and a photo of the 3 of them inside.  You wind it and it plays A Thousand Miles, which has significance to us because when my ex husband and I weren\u2019t getting along he stole them (the kids) and moved country, and we didn\u2019t see each other for almost a year, and my daughter used to listen to that song when she was really missing me.  Anyway, it\u2019s beautiful, I love it, I cried (which I\u2019m sure they expected) but at the same time I\u2019m mortified at how much they must\u2019ve spent on it.  I\u2019d never give it back, but I know how you must feel.  My 13yo is a talented artist and he also gave me a picture he drew, of the 4 of us as tigers with me watching over the kids, lol.  I intend to get the part that represents the 3 kids tattooed on me.", "Soft YTA because I know you meant well. But your son was probably so excited to be able to do that for you. Apologize and have a heart to heart.", "I have been reading a lot of complaints from twentysomethings having tantrums over not getting good enough gifts, and it\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nYou have raised a mature, selfless, thoughtful young man. What a gift in itself. \n\nI have no opinion on whether you should keep the money because I truly don\u2019t know but I just couldn\u2019t help but comment on what a good job you seem to have done parenting wise.", "Not a judgement but I am proud of your son and proud of your parenting. An 18 year old who can think of that is going to be someone's dream come true. May your family always stay abundant in the wealth of love and may monetary wealth follow suit.", "Reserving judgement until I can see through all these tears! \n\nYou raised a fantastic kid and you should be proud of yourself.", "So, let\u2019s get this straight:  you didn\u2019t accept this thoughtful gift out of pride.  Nice\u2026/s", "YTA. By doing this you turned a moment that should have been so positive and memorable into something very different. Because of ego. It seems he sees and understands your situation better than you do. It's unfortunate you were unable to see clearly at the moment.", "NAH or possibly a super soft YTA. Your son was trying to do a nice thing for you. While I understand your feelings around money gifts, it ultimately comes down to pride.\n\nYou have raised your son for 18 years, from the evidence in this post, you appear to have raised a good man. Seems to me \u00a3100 is a small token of appreciation for that.", "You should have waited to return it.", "NAH. Everyone's heart is in the right place. I hope you all enjoy your dinner. Much love", "Soft YTA. \n\nI totally get wanting your kids to not give (or spend) their money to you. My daughter does okay for herself, but she doesn't have a lot of extra. But when my birthday or Mother's Day rolls around she goes all out for me. Buys me stuff and takes me to dinner. It's really hard to not try to pick up the check but I know that if I did that, I would really hurt her feelings. This is something she WANTS to do for me, and I need to let her. \n\nYour son is showing a lot of maturity in this gift. By refusing it you really rejected him. I know that was not your intent!\n\nYou should have accepted the gift and then maybe put the money aside so that when he needs something for school you can then purchase it for him, or maybe get him a big birthday present with it. \n\nAccepting a gift does not mean that your children are supporting you. It means that you raised a good kid who has a real understanding of people and wants to help. That's a big parenting win and you should be really proud of him for it.", "Yes! He made an effort and you just made it sound like its better nothing than something from you. YTA", "\nNAH\n\nWhat a lovely, thoughtful  son you've raised, kudos to you & your wife.\n\nMaybe you could've taken the money & done something for the 3 of you so your son didn't feel disappointed.\n\nIn the  emotion of the moment though I can understand why that didn't occur as a compromise.", "Yta", "YTA - a little, yeah. He did something nice for you and you immediately refused it.", "Yep. YTA. Instead of being grateful and accepting of love - something we always teach our kids to do - you rejected the gift because you\u2019re too good for it. Literally. That\u2019s gotta suck for him. He probably didn\u2019t want to buy gifts because it would be a waste of money.", "YTA.  It took a lot for him to give that to you and you basically slapped him in the face.  Not great.", "Jesus, some of these comments are ridiculous. NAH. Everyone involved in this seems kind and lovely and I think all you need to do OP is ensure your son knows how much you appreciate him and how grateful you are to have a wonderful, empathetic son. And ignore all the harsh comments here because they\u2019re all insane.", "YTA. You raised a compassionate son. Now teach him how to gracefully accept kindness from others.", "YTA - I think this is a chance for you to understand that your son is no longer a child and can be treated like an adult. He wanted to do something nice for you and you basically just shoved it back in his face.  A little humility would do you some good, IMHO.", "NAH your son wanted to do and did an amazing thing. I think the immediacy of returning the money was the shocker and perhaps could have been done later but I don't think he's going to hang onto that adversely beyond this week. \n\nIn reality, you've already shown him how to be a good enough man to do something like that, and now you also showed him it's not his responsibility to take care of you two until you're too old to take care of yourselves.", "Tell your son he still has plenty of time to gift you later in life! It's awfully thoughtful of him to do so. You're lucky!", "YTA for letting your pride get the better of you. Get used to your adult child having a grown up relationship with you", "Congratulations OP, for raising such a caring human. I admire your attitude about not taking money from your kids, but maybe instead of taking the actual cash, you suggest he treat you and his mom to something - dinner, ice cream, a movie, etc. Something that you can enjoy together as a family. NTA", "NAH- BUT you might have hurt his feelings. \n\nYou maybe should have saved that $100 and given him $200 back at his birthday. Or gone to dinner and used it, or taken him to amusement park with that money/ use it for him. Or his tablet band concert . \n\nBut to just say no and reject it on the spot, might have killed the moment a tiny bit. \u201cEveryone feels bad for various reasons\u201d", "Sorry YTA. I know a gift for him wasn\u2019t possible, maybe take a few dollars of grocery money each week, plan ahead. I was a single mom of 2 and never did I share my money issues with them, that wasn\u2019t their burden. He did something sweet and kind.", "I doubt very much you made him feel like shit or insulted him as some here are thinking, but I also believe he was disappointed.  I like the suggestion of using it for a family treat.  That way you're accepting his gift and still not depriving him of the gift he received from your family.  \n\nYou raised a great kid.", "MERRY CHRISTMAS AND CONGRATULATIONS! You raised a wonderful son. Let him treat you. Awesome, you all have a great time, let us know how your evening goes!", "YTA. Your son did something nice for you and does not even get the satisfaction of having done that. Put your pride aside and accept the nice gesture.\n\nI'd also like to point out that you are calling an 18 year old \"child\". I know that for you he will be your child till the day you die but you need to recognize that now he is technically an adult and respect that. Otherwise you risk this attitude sneaking into other parts of your relationship and possibly damaging it.\n\nI'm saying this from the point of view of a 30 something year old whose mother literally pouted and stopped talking to her this xmas for a few days after \"her child\" (yes, me, the 30 something year old) sent some money home after finding out that mom was struggling on her pension. I get that your situation is not as extreme but you should adjust your view a bit so that you don't risk getting to this point.\n\nYour son loves you and wants to help. He is happy to do so and you should let him. There is joy (and relief, because your financial suffering affects those who love you!) in helping.", "NTA but u love the idea you will let him treat you to a nice dinner. You could also go grocery shopping and make a dinner as a family. That could be a new tradition...", "YTA. Hope you treasure the shit outta that card because if your son has any sense, he\u2019d never give you a single gift again. \u201cHe looked disappointed\u201d no shit Sherlock. He did a very nice thing and you basically spat all over it because pride.", "Soft YTA\n\nIdeally, what you told your son is correct, but the reality is actually very different sometimes, especially in times of strife. I've known kids who paid rent to their parents while working part time because their fields couldn't keep up with the payments of living or because a parent fell ill.\n\nYou have a kind, empathetic, and generous young man of a son, and that is reflected in the fact that he is willing to share his good fortune in times of strife. Material needs are a foundational need to be sure, but to raise a child to thrive, they're only the beginning. If your son is thriving socially, emotionally, and mentally, then you are better than a lot of parents out there, including ones who are materialistically better off than you, and that, more than your finances, is something to be proud of.\n\nTake it from an adult child of parents like that.", "Sorry but yes, YTA. Your son was probably so excited to give you his first Christmas gift as an adult and you rebuffed his newfound agency. I could understand if he was still a kid, and I appreciate your sentiment because I generally agree with it, but you should have let him gift it to you for Christmas. It was not like he was offering to help with your bills or anything out of pity. It was rude.", "Whoever has said that OP is TA, it's a sad, lonely and frustrated person, honestly. Do you even understand their family dynamics, these people love each other so much that they would give their last penny for the loved ones. OP, you remind me of my mother. All the best for you and your family", "JFC, sometimes this sub can be brutal. \n\nNAH Your son did a very lovely thing and that kind of empathy is hard to teach. It's clear he had it modeled for him in some way, shape, or form. You are not an AH for refusing it because I understand that you want your son to use that money for himself. And he's not an AH for being disappointed because I also understand the kind of love that makes me need to repay that love and happiness by giving it back with no expectation of getting something back. \n\nBut a bit of advice for the future? Just accept the gift and use it to do something together? An emphatic \"THANK YOU\" is probably the best return gift you could give him. It means the world to us gift-givers. Merry Christmas OP and best of luck.", "NAH. This brought a tear to my eye reading. Your son did a wonderful thing. Such a sweet and thoughtful gift. I imagine he got disappointed and sad that you refused the gift. I agree with some of the other posters. Accept the gift, but use it for something that benefits all of you. And/or get your son something extra special and give him the biggest hug and kiss ever.", "I give my parents gift cards usually for Christmas and the like. It feels weird giving them cash, but like, I don't know which particular hosta my mom wants or what fishing gear the old man is looking at.", "NAH, your son did a very mature and thoughtful thing, and so did you. My parents are so deep in my pockets idk the last time they came up for air, I appreciate that parents like you exist.", "YTA. Geeeez. \n\nYou should have accepted and then bought things for the house y'all needed and could share - a few groceries, new towels... Something \n\nHe's 18, not 12. He clearly sees the stress you're under and wanted to help and you made him feel like shit for offering the only thing he knew could help.", "I love your son. \n\nI'm reluctantly voting NTA because I fully understand your situation, but I think there's a bit of AH in there, too.\n\nAccept your son's gift graciously. Use the gift to get something for the whole family to enjoy together. Maybe buy the ingredients for a meal you can't often splurge on, or go to a movie -- something special for all of you. Take your time deciding what to do and make it as perfect as you can.", "NTA but.....Your son did a beautiful grown-up thing for both of you.  As a 50-year-old dad myself, I understand your pride.  You could also have demonstrated that pride by accepting the money in the spirit it was given and then used it to buy something that benefits your whole family.", "NAH - no asshole here  \nYour son sounds like a very nice person, and you too. He's disappointed because he wants to help you. But I agree with your idea that child should not support financialy their parents (but well, sometimes life gives no other choice).\n\nI think you handle this really nicely, you showed appreciation and explain why you didn't accept the gift.", "NTA! The reason I say this bec no matter what my parents are the same way as you. They don\u2019t want my brother and I to spend money on them. Esp since my brother and I aren\u2019t what you would call have extra income to spend. My parents have done so much for me that I wanted to do something special for them for Xmas. I gave them money for Xmas. I gave each of them 100 dollars. When the opened up their gifts from me, they teared up, and told me that I gave them too much. Take 1/2 of it back. I told them no I\u2019m not taking back 1/2 bec yall have done so much for me. Also I don\u2019t treat yall like to things I would like to throughout the year. \n\nParents don\u2019t want their kids to spend money on them bec, parents want to be able to provide for their children. No matter how old they are. OP, you wanted your child to enjoy the Xmas money that was given to him by other family members. You and your husband are great parents. How many teenagers out there are compassionate and don\u2019t want their parents to go without? Yall have raised a very compassionate child. I\u2019m glad that y\u2019all have come to a compromise. The reason your son was sad at first is bec in his teenage mind he thought yall would be overjoyed with his thoughtfulness. Which yall were. Don\u2019t get me wrong. He didn\u2019t see that bec yall wanted to give him back the money. Next time he gives yall money as a present but don\u2019t want to keep it. Put it to the side for him for a rainy day. \n\nGreat parents will never take from their children nor do they expect their children to take care of them in the future. Continue to be the great parents yall are", "Soft YTA.  It was money that didn't deprive him of necessities, and he wanted to give it to you.  Perhaps you could have used some of it for a family experience, emphasizing this makes you happy, so you didn't feel like you were keeping it for yourself.", "NTA. That's the very parent thing to do. But a gift giver wants to have their gifts appreciated, so maybe in this situation one of the bills could be kept and shared between the parents and the other returned to the son.", "NAH but I would go back to him and tell him how much the gesture meant to you and how proud you are of the person he is.", "YTA. You robbed him of the feeling of joy the comes from giving to others. Apologize and talk to him about how your pride got in the way. Talk about how giving selflessly is a wonderful thing in this world (non-profits, charities, volunteers, etc.). Tell your son you\u2019re going to do something fun or useful with the money, and then go volunteer somewhere.", "I'm glad you were able to fix this, make sure you also let him know that you will always treasure his thoughtfulness.", "YTA\nYou take the money and then go buy your child a Xmas gift \n\nWhat the \u2026?", "Nta I would do the same.\nMy kids never have to give me money it's always the other way around.\nThe thought of him was super and as long as you tell him that and keep telling hem that and explain that you want him to have everything he wants and deserves you guys will be ok it's NTA", "YTA. Gifts are normally given from the heart. You meant well but take the gift.", "When I was 17 money was an issue in our family and I found out by accident that my big sister 18 was paying the phonebill. My phone bill too.

You are. But just a little. Like\u2026newborn baby sized asshole.", "NAH. I understand you not wanting to accept money from your son, I would feel the same way. And a bit guilty that he felt he had to use his own gift money for you. But if you think about it, your decision was for you -- comfortable for you -- and a way that you 'give' to your son by refusing to take it and have him buy something nice for himself. You got to 'give'. He did not. His choice was that he \"did\" choose to buy something nice with it, by giving it to you. In a way, you took away his ability to get joy from giving to you. He didn't give it out of guilt. I might have another conversation and see how he feels about figuring out a way that that money can go toward something tangible for the family -- that he can see and feel that he made happen.", "NAH. You and your son are sweet and compassionate. I love PPs suggestion of letting him treat you for a nice meal. Thank you for sharing this heartwarming AITA. Sending your whole family some love.", "To spare your son's feelings, you and your wife can accept the money but you don't have to spend on yourselves. Use it later to take the family somewhere for the day to build experiences together. You can also add it to his college fund if it's available or invest it and give it to him when he graduates or in a few years. Your son is a very generous and thoughtful young man. He has a beautiful soul and you've raised him to be empathetic and caring. Don't crush that spirit because of your pride. Take pride in the awesome human being you've raised and find a creative way to spend the money to help remove some of the guilt and shame you're experiencing right now. Remember you've given your kids the greatest gifts of all. A safe environment, their essentials met, and loving parents who go to the moon and back for them. Believe me that goes a much longer way than any material gift could.", "NTA, as others said you should use the money for everyone to do something or something everyone can use. \n\nI hope you and your wife are proud of the young man you two raised, and as a new parent I hope my son will be as kind as your son.", "NTA.  My dad hates if we spend a lot of money on him.   It was a nice gesture though, and could have been used to buy something for everyone, or pay a bill.   Then he\u2019d still benefit but feel good that he gave you a gift.", "NAH. Maybe take the money and treat your son to a great meal.", "NAH. But maybe see if he wants to use the money for something to do as a family.", "YTA - his gift was given in the spirit of love and sharing. You took away his ability to show that to you in a way that would help your family. Go apologize, tell him it was a knee jerk pride reaction and graciously accept the gift. You\u2019ve clearly taught him to be kind and giving; he is only doing what he was taught. This is a proud parent moment in my book.", "NTA- but I\u2019m glad you updated and he\u2019s taking you to a nice dinner.

Times have been tight for us the last few months. Our bills are paid, but we have essentially no discretionary income, and that means that Christmas presents were pretty much off the table. This is the first Christmas where this has been the case, and my wife and I have been pretty sad. Our son is aware of this, and being an empathetic kid, was accepting of the situation. He\u2019s also lucky in that I have a few wealthy relatives that give him money for Christmas each year.\n\nSo, Christmas morning comes around, and our son comes in and gives us each a card. We smile and open them, and in each card is $100. It almost brought me to tears. He used his own Christmas money to give us a gift, even though we couldn\u2019t give him anything.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m torn. I got up, gave him a hug, thanked him, and then gave the money back. I told him that he will NEVER have to give us money. My personal feeling is that gifts of money go DOWN generations, or sideways, but never UP. I absolutely do not want either of my children giving me money, and would never ask. It just seems wrong to me.\n\nHe seemed a bit disappointed. I took the cards and put them up on the mantle over the fireplace, and made a big deal over how much we liked them, but I refused the money, told him to keep it and buy himself something nice with it.\n\nAm I the Asshole for refusing this gift?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH. I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from! You don\u2019t want to set up the precedent of being willing to take money from your child, and it goes against your pride. I get that! But your son wanted to give you a gift. How is giving you $100 as a gift any different from him spending money to buy you something? Would you have refused a non-monetary gift from him? He\u2019s not just randomly insisting on giving you money to help you out, it\u2019s a Christmas present\u2014take it in the spirit in which it\u2019s being given. Teach your young adult son that it\u2019s okay to be vulnerable, that you can count on family, etc. A good compromise could be that you tell him you\u2019ll put it away for an emergency, or tell him that since it\u2019s a gift for you to do with as you please, that you want to take him and his mother out for a nice dinner. Either way, I definitely don\u2019t think you were an AH, I just think you reacted the way most parents would, and forgot to keep in mind that your son is a young adult now and wants to be able to do things like this instead of being the \u201ckid\u201d that always gets taken care of.", "Soft YTA. It reminds me of when my wife doesn't want her father to pay when we all go out to eat together. It's not that we need him to pick it up sometimes too. I had to explain to her that she was denying him the joy that he so obviously gets from do it.\n\nYou denied your son's joy in doing something nice for you when he obviously feels you have taken care of the family.  Please go to him and say you had a change of heart.", "1000% YTA. Quit being so damned proud and allow yourself to accept the gift.", "I agree with the soft yta. He wanted to do something nice for you since he was in the position to do it. Whether you felt guilty you were taking money given to him by your own relatives thereby your relatives were giving you money via him or you just felt it was wrong that he should be giving you money I think it was probably a combination of the two. In any case it was very generous of your son and he really was trying to help. You should have accepted it it would have made him feel really warm and fuzzy inside that he was able to help you and not be selfish and spend the money on himself. I don't know if there's a way to back up and say well if you'd like you can put some of that toward the electric bill or you know something like that anything they give you a little wiggle room or tell him to buy groceries for the week. But you may regret your words if someday you are in desperate need of his help and he'll say but you told me you will never accept money from me so therefore I will not offer or give you any.", "YTA. Graciously accept and then go out and buy him something he really wants. You crushed his feeling of joy at being able to do this for you. No apologies are going to bring that feeling back. btw, helping others crosses all generations (down, up, and sideways). That\u2019s what family means.", "NAH. The only other thing you could have done is taken the money and gotten something for him, I think.", "YTA for letting pride get in your way.   I have 3 adult children also and if they want to give me a gift, I let them because it shows they kind generous people who want to make others happy.   If they gave me what I felt was too much money, I would repay them by buying them something they wanted or needed.   I understand times being tough and not being able to afford gifts.   Next year suggest that instead of money, everyone give either a handcrafted item or a gift of time.   Presents do not need to be $100 video games or tennis shoes, it can their favorite cake, a book shelf they made or anything that you both enjoy.", "Your son is a good man and it sounds like you and your wife have done a phenomenal job raising him. I don\u2019t think you were an asshole, you showed your appreciation and I understand why you gave it back. Even if he may not have. I would recommend a deeper father to son conversation to talk about it. \n\nI have given my parents money many times to help out both growing up and as an adult and I\u2019ve always been very happy to just help and I keep it low key as I know they aren\u2019t happy to have to ask me. I\u2019m pretty sure my dad would rather shove bamboo shoots under his nails and it\u2019s my mom that usually reaches out. I can see both sides here. Have a moment with your son about it.", "A gentle YTA (where A is the best intentioned it could possibly be). It\u2019s a hard lesson to learn, but sometimes, accepting a gift offered sincerely is in a way giving a gift back to the giver.", "Yes yta wtf ?", "YTA. You stole a child's joy at giving a gift. A better plan would have been to hug and thank him and then, secretly plan to spend it when he was with you, perhaps for the whole family or just him and you. Your ego crushed his joy.

Take the gift, use him, and find a way to make it up to him later on", "It would have made your son feel so good if you had accepted that gift.", "NAH", "NTA. I was raised that parents shouldn't take money from their children. My father is a firm believer in that. My mother is asking for money all the time or other support, which I help with when I am able but I refuse to do that with my own kids because I feel that it's wrong. That being said, there's nothing wrong with letting him treat you to dinner as others have suggested. Your son sounds amazing, empathetic and you did a great job raising him. The world needs more like him.", "As the child of parents who didn't always have a lot ... I have to say NAH. I found out that at one point, my mom sold her diamond from her engagement ring to make Christmas happen. It was years later and honestly, part of me is still horrified by it. I knew we didn't have a lot as kids, but my parents gave us memories. And not like going to Disney type things. Normal, every day things that I become more and more grateful for as each year of my life passes. I'm 37 now and I understand where my parents were coming from but it's also so important for me that they know that they gave me the best childhood. I read so much on this sub that makes me so sad for kids who have shit parents. Just because we were poor doesn't mean growing up was shitty. Yeah, we sometimes had to scrounge for change to get gas in the car. Had I been in your son's shoes, I would have done the exact same thing. We recognize your sacrifices and we want to ease your stress. We just want you to know that money doesn't make happy families and happy kids. How our parents make memories with us and how they love us is what matters.", "My dad would have done the same thing. Was the same age the first time I paid for dinner. I had to sneak the waitress my card before the check came. That was after many dinners where I'd offer to pay or split and he'd look at me like I was crazy. Kind of got frustrated because I just wanted to show him I was doing okay on my own and be treated like a man.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nYour son is following the example you've set; sacrificing something for your loved ones. And while I understand your pride, and reticence at accepting such a gift, maybe allow your son to feel as though his sacrifice meant something?\n\nMaybe use his gift on something for the family. A day trip or something. If he says \"but I wanted you to spend it on you\" then tell him your gift to yourself is time with him and your wife.", "NAH, but what a lovely kid. Now that you've both had some time to think about it, I would have a quiet word and tell him how touched you and his mother were about his kindness, and how the real gift was knowing that he's become the thoughtful young man you hoped to raise.\n\nIt doesn't sound as if you adequately explained the above in the moment - I completely understand why, you were surprised and emotional - but if you explain now, those words will mean a lot. And that is you then giving him a gift in return - letting him know exactly how proud his parents are, and how much he is loved.", "Very slight YTA. I think your heart was in the right place. I do get it-- I think I'd be tempted to do the same under the circumstances tbh. But the better thing to have done is just accept the gift.

As a grown woman, the happiest time was when I was able to gift my parents a present that was something they would not have been able to do for themselves.

I\u2019ll talk to him about it.", "What I was going to suggest. :)", "I agree with this. There is an emotional aspect I'm sure the son was feeling deeply that could be further acknowledged.

My mom\u2019s parents both died in 2013 and my mom had cancer too, my brothers and i (29, 31 and 34) had decent jobs and we got my parents (my dad had helped take care of them) a big tv (the guys) and a cordless dyson vacuum.  My mom was a bit upset over the money we spent but it was wonderful and they still use both gifts.

It gives you a great sense of accomplishment to help your parents. For me, it was a a washer/dryer. The washer broke and my brother kept trying to get the repair men to fix these machines. They would work for about a week when they were able to get the parts and my Mom was complaining about not being able to properly wash her clothes. It felt so good to be able to take my tax return and get her those machines. The store gave me a discount because it was cheaper for them for me to buy new machines.  It is a great feeling and your son should be able to experience the pride that occurs when you can help your parents. You raised a great kid.", "NAH. My dad is the same way as you OP- I know he would never accept a monetary gift from me no matter how much he was struggling because he wants me to have the world. Would that stop me from helping? Absolutely not because I want him to have everything too and I've seen the sacrifices that have been made over the years to help me have a better life than he did. I love that you guys are going to do something together to make a memory and hope you take this as a sign that you raised him well and that he clearly cares about you and your wife so much.", "That sounds like a wonderful suggestion.", "My parents had to let her though. They have a beautiful relationship with her. Goodluck for 2024 x", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "This whole story made me tear up. You guys sound like an amazing family with an amazing son. NAH.", "That would be a nice thing! Make sure to let him know he much he is loved and how much his efforts are appreciated \ud83d\ude42\n\nEdit: a word", "You're welcome. Just remember this is a sign that you and your wife have raised a wonderful human being who loves his family. The world needs more parents like you and kids like him in it.", "An apology would go a long way. Kids need to learn their parents make mistakes too.", "I think that would be a good compromise \ud83d\ude0a", "Accepting a gift from your kid doesn\u2019t make you less of a father or man. I know from experience with my parents that it\u2019s not easy, but look at it this way: you raises a kid who has the kindness and compassion to want to help you. That in itself is something beautiful!", "What's your son into? I got a bunch of funkos I can give him a nice one.", "I know! I\u2019m actually a bit overwhelmed by all of the well-meaning advice; especially from the Y T A voters!", "That\u2019s a good perspective. I guess what hit me so hard is that we weren\u2019t able to provide him with Christmas presents, and maybe I\u2019m letting my pride get in the way.", "Thanks for your story.", "Thanks. Your words mean a lot!", "No, it seems you don\u2019t have that problem. Thanks for the feedback.", "It\u2019s rough. Our oldest is grown and has her own career, and we\u2019re now looking down the barrel of being empty nesters. I will say that, if I could choose a \u2018problem\u2019 to have, this is one of the best ones!", "He does have a good heart, and good on you for raising your son to be that way!", "Thank you for sharing!", "Absolutely. I\u2019ll gladly accept a Y T A vote, if that\u2019s how you feel.", "Good idea! I\u2019ll keep that in mind.", "It is awesome. A bit scary, if I\u2019m honest, but awesome.", "Sounds like my almost 6 year old. We\u2019re not struggling, but she always wants to get coins out of her piggy bank on the rare outing for takeout. My love for her grows each time and I smuggle them back into the piggy bank.", "Thanks for your kind words!", "Thanks for your feedback and kind words.", "Thanks. He\u2019s turning out to be a pretty good dude.", "Thanks for the feedback. It just hurt my pride, which is a \u2018me\u2019 problem. I\u2019m going to talk to him more about it.", "So there\u2019s YTA, ESH, and NTA judgments. I think this is the first NSH (no one sucks here) judgment I\u2019ve ever seen", "Not maybe, you are. You raised a nice son, take pride in that.", "I know the change from having kids in the house to being an empty nester is scary, but that said, it's a reward for doing well with them because you have set them up for success.\n\nIf it helps you remember how well you've done, I don't mind sharing my husband wouldn't dream of giving either of his parents money because he doesn't trust them to spend it wisely. Your son has confidence that you will spend that $100 wisely.", "As a kid who had to argue with my mom to get her to accept my financial help when it was a rough time for her and I was 19 and making bank in tips at my job, please accept it and do something for the household with it. At that age it feels good to help out and pay back. Kiddo will need help as he becomes an adult\u2026 let kiddo give help to you when he can", "Did you never buy your parents anything as an adult?  You're probably going to have to get over the hang up on that.  Certainly no AH here, but it's perfectly normal for grown kids to give gifts to their parents.  \n\nHow well off the giver vs recipient matters far more than age.  If a family member significantly less well off than me gave an extravagant gift I'd be a bit hesitant to accept or would be sure to quietly get them something significant later, but kids become adults and sometimes that direction inverts.\n\nThat shouldn't be taken as a failure, but as a success.  You've raised your son well and he's in a better situation and wants to give back for how you've prepared him.  Nothing wrong with that.", "As the parent of two young adults in the US right now, I deal with a lot of this stuff, too. But as I said in a reply, I am sure he gave this with his entire heart. \n\nGood kid. You're a good parent, OP.", "NAH is the flair that this sub uses. (No assholes here)\n\nEDIT: typo.", "He\u2019s a good kid, and we are very proud of him. He hasn\u2019t always had the easiest time, but he\u2019s turning out to have the best of all possible traits: being a good person.", "I have given them plenty of gifts, but never cash. That\u2019s where my pride gets involved, for better or for worse.", "Thanks.", "Is that what that means? Ahahah I thought it was Not AssHole!", "Fair enough, I can understand that distinction I suppose.  It does still come a bit into play with who pays when going out to eat, but I do feel that's a bit different too (as are gift cards) when it's intended to do something you might not do with your own cash.", "Truth. I think your original sentiment is right though; it just hurt my pride to have him give us money.", "He gave you gift cards to do with as you want. Spend them in the spirit they were given. It\u2019s not the same as him handing you a bunch of notes. \n\nYour son is becoming a good man. Help him with his pride too.", "The thing I probably would have done is take the money and buy the present I wished I could have given him.  It honors the gift but also brings across the fact that the thing you most wish you could have done is get him a better present.\n\nI did something like this with a gift card my brother got me for steam and I turned around and used it to buy a game for him that we could play together.", "He gave us cash, because that\u2019s all he had to give. And yes, we\u2019re very proud of him. My pride got in the way.", "Thanks for your insight and feedback. I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019ll let him treat us all to dinner at a place of his choosing."]}
