We agreed that we would both give his mother R1.5k a month for food since his mom is an amazing cook and im not the best, originally i was going to cook after i came home from work but then we figured itd be better if she cooked, he'd cover electricity and insurance for the car since it's his, I'd cover Fuel (R400) for work transport, and once I hit 25 they would make me the main driver on the car so I could drive myself to work. I'm in my second month of being here and nothing we agreed on has stayed in place. I'm not sure he is paying his mom the agreed amount we said, and suddenly my amount being paid is to cover every other expense (water, electricity, food, fuel, internet) and they are pressuring me to pay them more and more. \n\nI work minimum wage so what I'm giving them is just over a third of my salary. They cook foods that I don't eat half the time, just foods they like, he is using the car to galavant and wants me to put more fuel in the car (or he won't take me to work) , he doesn't want to pay the insurance anymore meaning I can't drive the car, and they won't let me cook my own food because they \"need\" the money for everything else. \n\nI had a talk with him and told him he was EXTREMELY misleading, because if I had been told about all these extra things in the beginning before I moved, I would've had to reconsider. Like mentioned, I work minimum wage and am currently paying off debts and I am struggling because of how much they are asking from me. This all came to light when I asked if I can rather cook my own food next month because I need some extra bucks in my pocket to pay for Christmas presents and into my debts, I've been slacking on them due to giving them so much, and he said I was an AH and selfish and ungrateful.\n\nI know I probably sound entitled as hell, but fair is fair. I was promised I could drive myself to work, I was promised certain amounts for things, now suddenly I can't drive the car and have to ask for permission to go to the shop to get a snack and I have to put a pause on paying my debts because they won't let me cook my own food.\n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1700229701, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xfpjk/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_misled_me/", "score": 1002, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
