People get weird about pregnancy.", "Or a Dalek.", "If she had a complicated pregnancy she wouldn\u2019t be traveling. Sounds like SIL is just entitled and likes ordering people around and she uses the pregnancy as an excuse.", "If she has complications that are severe enough to limit her from walking up and down a single flight of stairs, then she would probably be on bed rest and not able to go on trips to visit people.", "If anything its the opposite, barring anything specific going on. Because they don't want people getting out of shape when they're pregnant.", "Please, for the love of all that is good with this world, send both your brother and sil this. This is legit the dumbest thing I have heard people claim in a while.", "Don't tell your SIL that your wife went up and down the stairs while pregnant.  She'll *go there* and claim that is why your son has cerebral palsy and she is \"actually looking out for her unborn child by not taking that risk!\"\n\nMy sister lives in a two-story house, *all* bedrooms are on the second floor, and she went up and down the stairs constantly while pregnant with both her kids.  She did it despite having SI joint dysfunction (her SI joint would dislocate randomly).\n\nNTA.  Your brother and SIL were hoping to *force* you to do what they wanted and are pissed that you refused.", "Show your post to SIL and tell her that there are plenty of hotels in the area.", "I went up and down stairs on crutches for the last 3 months of one of my (recent) pregnancies.  Your SIL is delusional if she thinks that pregnant women aren\u2019t supposed to go up and down stairs.  In fact, exercise is recommended in moderation for most pregnant people.", "Yeah, I'm nearly 38 weeks and I still using the flights of steps at work. I look awkward as, but its great excercise. Unless this is her doctor's advice, I don't buy it. NTA.", "As have millions of women. God knows where your sil got her information from.", "Listen, I\u2019ve had 4 children. I have a loft conversion which is my bedroom. I have climbed 2 flights of stairs for bed, the day of giving birth. Was it difficult? Yes. Is there any advice telling pregnant ladies not to use stairs? Absolutely bloody not. She is too lazy or wants to be waited on. Either way, she can f##k off with her rubbish and you don\u2019t need to think about it again. The cheek of going into someone\u2019s house and demanding they change their room!  Your child is more important than \u2018Mrs I think I\u2019m special because I\u2019m pregnant.\u2019  Jesus, some of the crap that comes out of the pregnant astounds me. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I\u2019m on bed rest and I still go up the stairs. SIL is just being dramatic.", " She\u2019s using pregnancy as an excuse, nothing more than that.", "Exactly!", "Sure they can! All you need is four wool socks, a mattress, and the will to make it happen!", "Its like the poor bastard who got on the subway and then they raised the fare. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kacASNARakQ", "\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "Nope, they managed to figure out stairs too. Just can't remember which episode lol", "Oh, I definitely understand that. Just trying to find any rationalization for why the SIL would think this request was okay.", "An incomplete pregnancy is no reason not to climb the stairs. If it's complicated enough that she can't do this, she probably shouldn't travel/visit. She's using her pregnancy as an excuse. take care of her son", "Kind of sad I didn't know this when I was pregnant so I could claim that as a reason not to do laundry \ud83d\ude01", "Similar story here. I went down in the morning and back upstairs at night. Spent most of the day lying down on a daybed downstairs, but upstairs was where I could shower as comfortably as I was able to at that point.", "I was on bedrest and wasn\u2019t allowed to do stairs. The thing is, if you\u2019re in that dire of a condition, you get to have that bedrest in the hospital where it isn\u2019t an issue. SIL is being ridiculous.", "I haven\u2019t even clicked the link, but MTA by The Kingston Trio? I grew up listening to them.", "Thank you for this imagery. I am now picturing hoards of pregnant sims standing at the top of the stairs doing the helpless waving that they can\u2019t go down \ud83d\ude02", "And if you're in that dire of a condition you're certainly not going on trips to visit family where you don't have access to your doctor and medical team for days.", "Exactly. I wasn't supposed to do stairs but the bathroom was downstairs and no bedrooms on that floor so I had no choice but I agree she should be hospitalized if it's that bad.", "Three kids, two of them twins, and I still went up and down the stairs. :P", "Plus, OP made it very clear what were the sleeping arrangements.\n\n>this is our system and I did warn my brother beforehand\n\nThey still showed up at OP's place and demanded for him to bend over backwards to accommodate SIL, when they clearly had other options.", "\u201cChoo Wagga Choo Choo?!?!\u201d *sets baby on floor and lights a fire in the toilet while pissing on the floor*", "Another excellent point! I wasn\u2019t even allowed in the hall without being in a wheelchair.", "Exactly \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf SIL was just doing too much", "This!"]}
