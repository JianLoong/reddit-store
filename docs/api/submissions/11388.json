Gentle walking on the flat is still recommended exercise, she wasn\u2019t on bed rest, but any avoidable stairs needed to be avoided as there was a risk of pelvic dysfunction.\n\nShe was in a fair amount of pain.\n\nIt got worse with her second kid.\n\nDoctor said that, given how flexible her hips now were, if she got pregnant again, she\u2019d be spending at least a third \u2014 if not half \u2014 of that pregnancy in a wheelchair.\n\nI haven\u2019t had kids and at this point I\u2019m not likely to, but it has been stressed by doctor and gynaecologist that I\u2019d have a good chance of ending up in a similar scenario.\n\nIt\u2019s not super common, but I also have enough mates who have had some mild expression of EDS / collagen issue their whole lives and never known or addressed it (symptoms can be modest and systemic depending on which collagen is affected and on environmental factors), and then they had kids, and the combination of \u201coodles of progesterone and relaxin\u201d with \u201cpreexisting collagen defect\u201d meant they entered into a lifelong physiotherapy situation.\n\nWhich is where I am *starting*.\n\n[paraphrased conversation below]\n\n(Gyno: you\u2019re a good candidate for a natural birth, though, because of the flexibility!\n\nMe: uh-huh. Will the joints go back where they were afterwards?\n\nGyno: *long silence* [no doubt thinking \u201cdid you not realise your body will change you git\u201d]\n\nMe: that\u2019s my concern\n\nGyno: \u2026\n\nMe: I like being able to walk, I\u2019ve enjoyed that privilege for over three decades now\n\nGyno: *visible light bulb*\n\nGyno: well shit that\u2019s a good point. that\u2019s a really good point\n\nGyno: elective C-section it is\n\nGyno: wait do you live in a house with stairs)", "we live in a first floor apartment with no elevator. my mum made it up and down these stairs regularly during three pregnancies. was she supposed to just live in the hallway? xD", "Please tell me you forgot the decimal point because my pelvic floor is crying at the very thought of a 4400kg baby?!", "That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking! Like exercise is good while pregnant as long as there aren\u2019t complications.", "Some system charge you different amounts for different length trips, so you pay when you get off.", "Lmaooiooo", "Yep all pregnant ladies live next to their mailboxes for the whole 9 months LOL.", "Ohh, here in the UK we get charged different amounts for how far we're travelling, but we always have to pay FIRST, 'cause if you refuse to pay at the other end, it's not like they're gonna drive you all the way back to the beginning as punishment, lol.", "I've only ever seen it on the subway, trains are usually paid beforehand.  I have no idea what actually happens if you can't pay on exit, definitely seem people arguing/pleading with the station attendant on exit before though.  \n\nThe song's talking about the subway in Boston, so I guess it holds up.", "My city(US) use to have free bus zone for the immediate downtown core. It was only 1mi by .5mi, essentially fully walkable. But buses passing through switched from pay-as-enter to pay-as-leave. Never really thought to much of it, as I always kept my transfer handy. But it is slightly better nowadays without it. We also use to have different fare zones based on distance, but they consolidated that, which was definitely an improvement."]}
