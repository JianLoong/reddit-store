The only way she wouldn't be able to is if she had a high risk pregnancy, but since they traveled from out of town it doesn't seem like the case since those that are high risk cant be to far from their doctor incase something happens. Most of the time high risk pregnancies need bed rest so this clearly doesn't seem like a high risk pregnancy. She just wants special treatment.", "NTA.\n\nWhile I agree that it can be inconvenient and difficult for a pregnant woman to climb stairs, your reason for wanting to stay on the ground floor is more than enough to warrant you keeping your room.
