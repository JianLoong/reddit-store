I have a six year old son that started living with me as his primary guardian when he was three and his mom went back to school. I met my wife through work, and I also met her father, who worked at the same company in a higher role than both of us. My wife knew I had a son, but I said I wouldn't introduce them unless we became a serious couple, because that wouldn't be fair to him.\n\nWhen my wife did meet my son, they got along really well. I invited her and her father over for dinner one night, and her father met my son for the first time. He was weird and awkward around my son and made strange comments about his appearance (his mom is black). I confronted him after the dinner, and he made some pretty pathetic excuses. After that I asked him to not contact me outside of work matters and asked her for space.\n\nA couple weeks later, my wife told me she had completely cut her father off for his beliefs. Our relationship became stronger than ever. When we got engaged she said she didn't want her father at the wedding. We ended up both transferring to other companies. As far as I knew he was gone from both of our lives for good.\n\nMy wife is pregnant and due in a month. She has already started maternity leave and has been looking for a new job to start after maternity leave because she doesn't want to stay at her current company. Yesterday she sat me down and told me her dad got her an interview for a job at our old company. She also told me she has been talking to him for a couple months and wants to know how I would feel about him knowing our future child.\n\nI told her the truth. I told her I felt betrayed and I felt like she betrayed my son, who she claimed to think of as her son as well. I told her that she would even ask me that makes her less of a person in my eyes. She started crying and asked me what kind of insensitive jerk would call the woman pregnant with his kid less of a person. I told her that was how I felt, and although the language was harsh, I felt it matched what she was asking for.\n\nAfter cooling off, I'm now unsure if my word choice was warranted and wondering if I was an asshole for speaking to her that way while she is pregnant and more emotionally vulnerable. I could have just said I wasn't okay with what she was proposing without insulting her character.", "created_utc": 1675781245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w3lzx/aita_for_making_my_pregnant_wife_cry_by_calling/", "score": 7623, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As the saying goes, if there's a racist at the table with ten other people, you have eleven racists. Your father\u2013in\u2013law has shown he's a racist. Even your wife knows that her dad is a racist as she had cut him off. Your father\u2013in\u2013law has not made any demonstration of repentance; yet your wife wants to invite that toxic presence into your home where it can poison your eldest child. What did she expect you to do and say?\n\nYour right that your words were harsh. But harsh was appropriate. It takes a lesser person to want to invite toxicity into the home, and that's what your wife did. She is the one who needs to apologize for even the suggestion of her father coming back into your personal lives. That she's pregnant is not an excuse for the ***extreme*** breach of trust she committed.\n\n**EDIT:** Some people are claiming that you are just as bad as your father\u2013in\u2013law. That's incorrect. Your father\u2013in\u2013law is a racist. You are opposing racism and keeping it out of your personal space. There is no moral equivalence.\n\n**SECOND EDIT:** Thanks for the awards!", "Everyone in these comments saying Y-T-A have obviously never gone through a similar situation. \n\nYou didn\u2019t call her less of a person, you said you saw her as less. Meaning the view you had of her before, you see her as a lesser standard now. She betrayed your trust. She didn\u2019t communicate with you until she had already followed through. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA imo", "NTA.. I was expecting to be calling you an asshole from the title but your FIL is racist AF. Racism is a non-negotiable.\n\nYour wife is willing to tolerate it because while she gets it \u201cin theory\u201d she doesn\u2019t really.  I look 100% white but I am not, my oldest daughter does not look white and she is not my husband\u2019s biological child. If my in-laws had treated her any different than any other child in the family they would be gone and I would be out so fast if my husband thought that relationship was more important than a child. \n\nIf your FIL came to you both and said he has done the work and realized he was wrong\u2026 and shown that he meant it, that would be a completely different conversation and you\u2019d be the asshole but that isn\u2019t what happened, your wife is willing to tolerate a racist.\n\nEdit: Since OP\u2019s comment got lost. Here\u2019s what was said that day.\n\n  >  Basically, when he met my son, he said \"I wasn't expecting that\" and asked \"is his mom in prison?\" (Which is so, so ironic.) He asked me if his hair had ever been washed and if I was worried about him going to school on top of a bunch of other ignorant shit. After the dinner when I confronted him he said it wasn't his fault because no one had prepared him and I didn't seem like the type to mix with \"that sort\" of company.", "I honestly don't know if I can give a judgement but the people here saying OP is just as bad as his FIL for what he said is batshit insane to me. Harsh? Sure. But a grown man being openly racist toward a child is not even close to what OP said. I can't fault OP for his disappointment in his wife", "NTA\n\nMy husband is biracial and I am Black. We had to cut his mom off (all her kids have at some point) for a while because she would just say off the wall racist shit and act stupid when confronted. She also very obviously treated the 2 Black DIL\u2019s worse than the non Black one. \n\nWe have a baby due this summer. We both have parental trauma and have both lost a parent. My husband and I had a discussion around if and what having his mom in our and our baby\u2019s life.\n\nThe fact is, his grandchild is going to have a biracial sibling. If he can\u2019t treat them both equitably then it\u2019s fair to keep them out of their life. \n\nIf you have never experienced anti-Black racism, you wouldn\u2019t get it. It\u2019s never the overt things that jar you, it\u2019s the little things. As someone raised in white foster homes, WHEW. \n\nYou are protecting both of your children. That being said, you should be open to discussing reconciliation and what that looks like", "NTA, harsh wording? Yeah, but you stated that SHE decided to cut him off, for being racist/his beliefs. Then decided to get back in contact with him without telling you. \n\nI am surprised by the Y T A\u2019s when situations are reversed and it\u2019s a MIL not respecting boundaries or even making racist statements people are so quick to call out the husband for not having a spine, not putting his family first etc. why is this different bc she is pregnant? I have had 4 kids and at no point did that make me want to associate with people who think that way\u2026\u2026", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Y-T-A judgements are missing the point that you want to protect your son from racist bigots and assumed your wife wanted to do the same. The father never even offered an apology.  What are you meant to do? Let a man back into your life who spewed racist shit towards your son and showed no remorse for it? While what you said was bad, what she did was worse. You can apologise for the choice of words, but if I were you I would stand by the decision not to want anything to do with FIL. What that constitutes is up to you.", "Maybe harsh, but honestly nta. You\u2019re protecting your kid and not accepting compromise with people who won\u2019t do the same.", "NTA because you are protecting your child from a racist. Which is what it basically boils down to. If he comes back into her life he will treat the oldest as a 2nd class citizen and that is not fair to your child. Call her out on giving her racist father a pass", "NTA. Hopefully your wife will decline any job offer from the old company. No reason to allow that garbage into or even near your family.", "NTA \n\nYou want your son protected from a racist and continued the relationship with your wife under the belief that she felt the same way. Now it turns out she does not and betrayed you and your son. She should be crying. Her pregnancy doesn't negate her choices.", "NTA. She\u2019s willing to forget and forgive a racist man that looks down on a child she claims to love. It\u2019s ok though because he would never treat HER pure child that way. \n\nOP you\u2019re having a child with this woman so this is going to be one of those pick your battle moments. Is this a hill you\u2019re willing to die on? Because even if you split she\u2019s definitely going to allow her father a relationship with your child. \n\nI would sit and talk with her and post some scenarios about if your father made disparaging comments about her child how would she feel and would she think twice to allow them in her life.", "Oh come on with all of the Y-T-A\u2019s in here; OP is NTA for stating a fact, that his wife wanting her racist dad back in their lives (which includes the life of his mixed child) not because he\u2019s seen the error of his ways and apologized, but because she\u2019s pregnant, does tarnish her image in his eyes and make her less than the woman he thought she was.  \nDon\u2019t defend racists and their enablers. Being pregnant does not make you immune from valid criticism, it doesn\u2019t make a special exception for allowing racism in your life, and it doesn\u2019t mean you can do whatever you want when you want it because you just feel like it. Like, has anyone read what the grandfather said to make OP write him off after a single dinner? You\u2019d really be okay with that person being around your kid after asking if the mom was in prison, implying that black kids have poor hygiene, and saying that you don\u2019t seem like the type to mix with \u201cthose people\u201d? You\u2019d just sit back and keep your mouth shut so a pregnant woman doesn\u2019t get her feelings hurt?", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Were your words a little harsh? Mmmm, maaaaybe, but if that\u2019s how you feel why should you lie to her? Her being pregnant doesn\u2019t give her a pass to go behind your back, does it?! NO!!! Her dad is a blatant racist, unless he changed? Did she mention that at all? Or is he still the same guy he always was and now because she\u2019s pregnant she\u2019s rethinking her NC relationship with him? \n\nIt seems like she should have just talked with you about all this before acting on it, because now you\u2019re left feeling hurt and betrayed and I totally get that. Do you owe it to her to apologize for your hurtful words? I think so, absolutely. But you\u2019re right to not want racists in your life, even by extension. She is ok with racists in her life, apparently. Everyone has to make choices.", "NTA your racist FIL should never be around your children again after his vile comments at that meeting. He verbally associated your young child with prison and filth! It is also vile that your wife asked about FIL being in your younger child\u2019s life specifically, not the elder. She\u2019s allowing him to make a distinction and divide in your family. She did betray you by secretly meeting with him for months. Your word choice was not the best, but her actions led you to respect her less. Focusing on your \u201cinsensitive\u201d reaction rather than her actions is a way to deflect. Ultimately this does speak to her character and what she is willing to condone.", "NTA your wife\u2019s father thinks of your son as less than a person. You initially wanted to break up with your wife so you would not expose your biracial child to racists. She said she would cut her dad off and you continued the relationship based on that promise. Now that you are married with a kid on the way, ie stuck, she let you know she actually didn\u2019t cut her dad off as promised. She expects him to have a relationship with the child you have together but what about your oldest son? Who is going to protect him in this situation? Your wife betrayed you. Your wording was harsh but your wife did go back on her word. Now you\u2019re in a lose lose situation where your oldest will either be exposed to racists or excluded from the extended family while your other child will be included but also exposed to racists.", "NTA - unless he has completely undone his racist ways you were harsh but not wrong.", "NTA. You could have been more sympathetic to your wife\u2019s situation, but you absolutely don\u2019t have to tolerate racists or racist sympathizers in your life.", "I go against the majority here and say NTA. \n\nBc everybody, pregnant or not, who would ask me \"hey, can we let this racist father of mine back in our lifes so he can have a relationship with my kid, oc only the white one\" is automatically an asshole and i would maybe also react with harsh words (ok, not the words you used and you should maybe apologize for it). I would make it VERY clear to her that only bc you guys are married and having a baby together does NOT mean your son will be less of a priority to you and at least as long he is a minor you will priorize protecting him from racists higher than her needs for getting back in contact with her dad.", "NTA\nMaybe you could have used different words. However, it does take a weak person to cave and bring a racist person back into your child's life.", "ESH. I get you, i\u2019d be mad too. I mean what would happen down the line when her father is in the presence of both kids, but treats your son differently? I feel like your feelings of betrayal are valid at this moment, but I do think that it was an asshole move to call her less of a person. It\u2019s her father and I get wanting to have him back in her life. You both could\u2019ve had a more constructive conversation about this, regarding expectations moving forward and her dad\u2019s behavior towards both kids.", "NTA Your word choice was not ideal but if someone asks how you would feel about something and you proceed to tell them how you would feel, and they get upset about the answer that's on them.", "NTA, she asked you how you felt and you were honest with her. Sometimes being blunt is effective at getting your feelings across.", "NTA every step forward you've taken was on the basis you were on the same page about this. I'm horribly disgusted for you.", "NTA she\u2019s okay with talking to her racist dad and that means she\u2019s okay with betraying your son. I\u2019d divorce over it tbh.", "NTA - You're protecting your children. People are acting like being called \"less of a person\" is the worst thing; it's not being welcoming to a racist is.", "ESH. She should have told you that she was talking to her dad and looking for a job at the old company. However, you way overreacted. She cut off someone very important to her. Even if it was for a very good reason, that\u2019s definitely not easy. And now, she\u2019s pregnant and emotional. Of course she is feeling emotional about her family. Have you talked about what she and her dad have been talking about. Has he apologized? Is he working on changing and becoming a better person?", "Nta", "NTA. Protect both of those kids from this kind of nonsense. I see this playing out with her father making his bio grandson feel superior over his sibling the same way gramps thought he was superior enough to make those comments. Stand your ground against racism especially when it comes to your kids. She was raised by that man.. keep that in mind, so it was easier for her to forgive him because your son isn\u2019t hers.", "As a human whose grandmother was a racist and I still loved her I say you need to apologize for how said it. Not for how you feel.", "As a native person, who has dealt with racist AHs before. I will say this. I understand that your protecting your son. But I will say the \u201cless of a person\u201d thing irked me. Because that is something that was said to me by a racist. You are a good parent for defending your son. But do me a personal favor. And don\u2019t use phrases like that in an argument. No one, should ever be told they are less of a person. I\u2019m going to go with NTA because you are defending your son. But you need to be more careful with your words, apologize to your wife, tell her that wasn\u2019t what you meant. And try to explain to her calmly why having this man in your lives is a bad idea. She may not understand BECAUSE he is her father and she loves him. But, if you calmly tell her why you were so upset, it may register for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She needs to hear your true feelings. It's ok to tell her that her choices have lead to you seeing her a different way. You also have to own up to your feelings. Exactly how do you feel about her now, and how is it different from before exactly? If I were to guess, a large part of this may be the loss of trust, and no longer feeling on the same page about things.

What I assume you meant with that was that your respect for her has dropped because she won't prioritise your child over her father's ignorant and racist ideas. You probably could have worded this a lot better, and should have led with the racists remarks being a deal breaker before. Still, I don't feel like you are the asshole here.\n\nThe reason I say that is because the argument you had was valid, she wants to welcome someone back into your life who has been highly disrespectful to your biracial son. For me (not a POC) that would be reason enough to keep them out of my life.\nAlso, the fact that during these months of reconciliation between your wife and FIL he has never reached out to you with an apology for his past behaviour, which tells me more than enough. If he was regretful of his past racist views and comments he would have already contacted you about this.\n\nI'm sorry OP but this is going to be a huge shitshow. Your wife is pregnant so probably feels validated in her decision to involve her father because \"FaMiLY iS FaMiLY\" \ud83d\ude44. You're going to be the one who has to look out for your sons wellbeing, so you have every right to not want that man in his life. \n\nThese Y T A verdicts are apparently all ignoring the racist aspect of this situation, and focussing on the wrong things. While you can't stop your wife from engaging with him, the fact that she disregards everything shows what kind of person she is. You can try and explain this again to her, but if she doesn't want to hear it, she actively chooses to ignore this behaviour and that makes her an enabler.\n\nEDIT: REPOSTING A COMMENT OF THE OP HERE ABOUT SOME OF THE RACIST REMARKS MADE:\n\n>Basically, when he met my son, he said \"I wasn't expecting that\" and asked \"is his mom in prison?\" (Which is so, so ironic.)

Also, he may have been weird and awkward because maybe children in general make him uncomfortable. Some people just don't know how to interact with children. Labeling someone a racist seems to be the new thing to do these days. I'm not saying he's not a racist, but I also feel like sometimes people are just waiting to take offense to something that may have actually just been curiosity or meant no harm. Racists usually have intent to cause discomfort, and I feel like people should be pretty sure of that intent before they throw the label around.", "Soft YTA \u2014 you have every right to be upset, but calling someone \"less of a person\" is rarely okay, regardless of whether or not the person is pregnant. \n\nI can see how/why your wife is struggling right now \u2014 cutting off family is tough, even when you are doing it for the right reasons. Probably especially in those cases, actually. That doesn't justify her behaviour, but it's probably more productive for you to explain how her actions hurt you and your son (and ultimately her and your unborn child), as opposed to attacking her personhood.", "YTA - You told the pregnant mother of your incoming child she's less of a woman because her pregnant brain thought it would be okay to try and reconnect with her parent.\n\nShe's also an asshole for doing this behind your back. However, pregnancy brain is a real thing that very much fucks with your entire state of being and it's unfair to not take that into consideration here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I do not disagree with OP's desire to cut the racist out of their lives. That is a very good thing.", "Absolutely YTA .she cut her father off to teach him a lesson, and is reaching out to someone who played a very important role in her life that she cares for, hoping that he can make a change. People change. I've seen 8t happen. \nYou have isolated yourself from the mother of your child at the cost of being politically correct with a racist old white man. When she leaves you, don't be surprised. You put her in a tough situation, but all evidence shows that he has always had her back, and you are a fairweather husband over a racist family member.", "YTA seriously, maybe you're not racist, but you're a massive sexist for calling your wife less of a person", "People change. It's her father. Of course they would want to reconnect.

You're the A-hole here.", "YTA. She is not responsible for her father's words and thoughts. She is allowed to have a separate relationship with her own father, apart from you.

She might have taken it as dehumanizing.\n\nI think it is good to clarify what you mean: it would make you think less of her character.\n\nEdit to add judgment because I forgot: NTA for being angry but you should make it clear she knows what you mean. You would think less of her character. You still would think of her as worthy of the respect due to any other person.", "I don't think she ever cut him off.

That it is like... contagious?", "This. Sometimes my partner tells me if something I've done makes them respect me less. It feels like shit to hear but it sure as hell makes me reflect on my behavior.", "It\u2019s sexism, pure and simple.

Has the dad taken a new turn in his views for instance. \n\nIdk I feel like it's fine for the wife to want her own FATHER to know her kid. That's not a huge ask. I get OP wanting to protect his own kid but it's still a big deal to cut someone out completely, forever, no mediation, nothing. Even the top comment reinforces this idea. \n\nESH because we're missing info. OP is an asshole if FIL can never have a path to mediation with the family of his daughter.", "Agreed. I feel it's natural to want your parents in your life, especially when you're pregnant, and that doesn't make you less of a person. OP can decide his own boundaries, but to unilaterally expect her to never contact her father again is also not realistic. It's very telling that she felt she had to go around his back. And she's and AH for that as well.\n\nHowever, the right kind of talk would be about boundaries. OP's wife needs to take responsibility in this too, because she can't allow racist behavior around the children. And it really sucks for OP to have to go through that.

He said he now views her less than because of her actions and decisions to reconnect with her dad, and she said she wants him around their second kid.

OP doesn't mention his wife's mother so I feel like she may not have her in her life right now. She cut off her dad (presumably her only living/present parent) the moment he expresses racist views towards the child of a man she wasn't even engaged to. She has spent years respecting that but now, she's pregnant with her first biological child and she's feeling all sorts of emotions and she wants her dad back in her life. I think it's unfair to completely devalue her feelings right now. I get where OP is coming from, his child comes first of course and racists can be damned but this incident has happened years prior I suspect and they have not talked to him since. I think wife should have approached OP first to let him know her intent to reconnect with her dad and then there could have been expectations of an apology and assurances that a change of attitude was in order from FIL and if there was any indication that attitude wasn't changed, then he's out again. But I don't believe it was ok for OP to call his wife a lesser person when he knows full well that she's pregnant, emotional and probably wants support from all the people who love her and there's nothing inherently wrong with wanting that. But again, I don't want to devalue the impact the racism had on OP (kid was 3-4 at the time, I suspect he has no memory of the incident) but communication is clearly not strong in this family!", "They were just dating when the dinner happened.

I\u2019m confused why so many of you are so desperate to keep racists in your life, but go out of your way to get in relationships with people of color/people who have children of color.

His pregnant wife. A person he swore to love and cherish who is carrying his unborn child. \n\nAnd he doesn't even know what the conversations have been. Maybe the dad apologized or explained something or is open to certain boundaries. \n\nThe original story is about the dad being vaguely weird about the kid being Black. That's bad and can warrant cutting him off if it makes it clear he's racist and not interested in changing. But people are acting like he's a member of the KKK or committed a hate crime.", "Just found out? Naw, no way. Unless she got some serious blinders on and considering she wants him back in her life maybe she's more cool with it then she has claimed.", "So, there\u2019s racism that stems from ignorance and there\u2019s racism that stems from hate. People who are ignorant and care to learn and be better? Ok, maybe see if you can guide them towards the light.   But not at the expense of a child. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about punishing the racist as much as it is about protecting OP\u2019s son. And a huge part of that is saying \u201cwe are not going to let people who hurt you be welcome in our family because you deserve to feel loved and safe.\u201d", "Just found out? She knew for at least long enough to get married and incubate a baby. This is not JUST finding out. This is knowing and deciding that after cutting off contact something else deemed the contact necessary despite the damage it does to a LITERAL CHILD. But it's not HER child, or a fully white child so it doesn't seem to matter that much to the wife.\n\nDisgusting!", "Seriously. Nuking your spousal relationships because they make mistakes (before even talking about it!) is not good advice. Idk why so many people are just okay imploding their own lives and not seeing the irony.", "Do we have any real proof she actually cut the dad off? So he wasn't invited to the wedding... That could have just been because of the incident. It doesn't mean he was cut off by her! She could have very well been playing the long game here because it's kind of convenient that after she's got the ring and the baby now dear ole dad pops back up!", "NTA.  Personally, I think less of your wife for her behavior.  She let that racist back in her life.  She wants him to spend time with your shared child.  Sooner or later, the kids would realize they were being treated differently by your FIL.  How was she planning to explain that?  She wants to go back to your old company, probably working in his department.  She needs to separate from him completely.  Otherwise, I don't think your marriage has much of a chance, I'm sorry to say.", "If she accepts a job that her father helped her get then she will be obligated to have him in her life.  She needs to make a clean break, find something on her own since her previous job was also because of her father.  I hate when women use the fact that they are pregnant to justify their behavior.  I am not sure how much bio mom is involved but by marrying a man with child, biracial or not, she is obligated to make that child feel loved and safe, and you can bet grandpa will make a much bigger deal about his white child, further alienating your son.  Your word choice was because you were upset, not because you are a bad person, you were just looking out for you child.  100% NTA, we all say things in the heat of the moment and think about how we could have worded it better later on.", "Divorce. Hate to say it but your kid never stands a chance. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re experiencing this but get out now. Never look back.", "ESH.  I believe you're 100% correct to be upset.  I fully understand and agree with your feeling of betrayal.  If she's your wife, it's not possible for her child to have a relationship with someone while keeping her stepchild out of it.  By having the FIL around one child, you're guaranteeing he's going to be around your son, and that can't happen.  If someone \"has to be prepared\" to meet any flavour of POC, they're racist on a fundamental level and will never change.  He will always be dangerous to your son, even if he learns to \"behave\" while he's around.  Your wife absolutely betrayed you and your son.  I understand her desire to have a support system, especially while she's pregnant and hormonal, but she's looking in the absolute wrong place and *has* to realize that.\n\nHowever. Your words were... ouch, dude.  Ouch.  Don't tell a pregnant woman that she's less than human because she's trying to build a support system for her baby.  Tell her she's looking in the wrong place, direct her to a more appropriate pool of candidates, but understand that while YES she made a mistake, she didn't do it out of maliciousness.  She cut him off because she agreed that he was out of line, wrong, and dangerous.  You know that she agrees with you when she's fully herself.  You need to talk through all of this with her.  If she doesn't come around... ugh.  Your children come first - **both** of them.  Not just the one that comes from her body.  And if she can't agree with that, you may have to make the decision yourself.\n\nI hope you update us, sir.  Good luck to you.", "NTA. \n\n>She started crying and asked me what kind of insensitive jerk would call the woman pregnant with his kid less of a person.\n\nWhat kind of person wants contact with someone who is racist? And wants their kid to meet a racist and call this racist grandpa knowing he hates his brother?", "YTA. Where is the compassion here? Do you not understand how hard it must be for a person to cut a parent out of their life? \n\nNo one is perfect. Racism is for sure a huge huge flaw but do you not understand how difficult it is for her to compartmentalize away a whole lifetime of a man that loved and cared for her? Assuming he was good to her and she had a good childhood it has to be incredibly hard for her to realize her child won\u2019t get that same love from that man. \n\nI am in no way saying cutting him out is not the right choice. If I were in your place and he was toxic towards my child I wouldn\u2019t want him around either. But you need to be compassionate about what your wife is sacrificing and try to have a more constructive conversation. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy for a bunch of strangers to say \u201cracism bad. Obv N T A.\u201d But he\u2019s not internet strangers\u2019 dad. It\u2019s hard to turn off love, even when the person you love is very flawed. \n\nSo yes, set boundaries. Don\u2019t let this person in your children\u2019s life if he\u2019s bad for them. But instead of being so cruel to your wife and calling her less of a person, realize this whole argument is because she IS a person and having to deal with a lot of conflicting feelings.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry but being pregnant does not mean you can be a AH and no one says anything to you. You\u2019re still human and you can still be corrected, insulted, etc. what kind of person would say that to her??? How about What kind of MOTHER would be ok with her child being associated with a racist? What kind of mother would want that in her home where her black child lives?? This says a lot about how she feels concerning your child.\n\nThis would be my hill to die on. Protect your black son at all cost!", "NTA. Racists could go get bent, along with those that defend them. Willfully exposing children to racist people in their regular day to day life is simply neglectful.", "NTA. I also think less of people who lie to me and do crap they said they wouldn't. OP married her in good faith believing she would not tolerate racism. She said she had cut ties, and would not condone it. She has now shown she lied about that.", "Strong NTA ! This woman got in contact with an open racist for financial gain. No matter how she frames this she is setting the stage for her to owe him for something and this horrible man will feel he has a right to this child and access to your family. I was prepared to YTA based on the title alone but damn...", "Yep, her father just doesn't want to miss out on the white baby.", "Re-introduce Grandpa to the picture and his mission in life will be to have his daughter divorced.", "\nSo basically she cuts him till she got married and pregnant than she\u2019s like ok, now I\u2019m having my baby, so he can come around and be racist grandpa again and basically said fuck you and your sons feelings cause baby is more important than your son and the baby needs a grandpa.\n\nSo she wants him in your home being loving to her baby but still being racist to yours ?\n\nThan she wants him around without an apology to you or your son ? \n\nYeah nope.\n\nThan to assume the moms in jail cause she black like wtf is wrong with him ?\n\nI\u2019m sorry OP you deserve better.\n\nGood on you for sticking up for your son.", "Like how exactly does she expect this to go?? Racist FIL gets to act as a happy grandpa to their white child while completely discarding OPs other child because he's black?? In what world would this not be incredibly harmful to OPs first son? If wife sees oldest child as her own, how would she even consider this option acceptable? OP is right to question her motives and prior acceptance of his child. Ffs.", ">Accepting a racist regardless of your relationship to them makes you 100% complicit in their beliefs.\n\nThat's why I didn't have a relationship with my grandmother (dads mum). She hated my mum because she's \"black\". Was not quite as bad with us as kids but once I was a teen I stopped visiting her. Worst part, she's the same damn ethnicity as my mum.", "There is no missing info.  FIL needs to come back and apologize to OP directly before anyone believes him.  Wife also knows this he is still the same.  That's why she was nervous about bring it up.  Her child has a half brother who is going to verbally abuse, to his face or behind is back,  I don't care if it's her child too.  It's the child's sibling.  By bring him into her life again she giving FIl approval of his language and views.  She is an AH for even suggesting it, without also FIl asking for permission to come over to apologize first", "Dad is probably offering the best of the best in job opportunities and good maternity leave compared to what her job is now.", "You realize if they divorce she'll have the right to have the grandpa see the baby whenever it's her custody right?", "I believe OP already has a course of action planned. And he's made his feeling towards this situation known. He knows, deep down inside, he's not wrong. Please, OP. Keep protecting your children. It seems you've got this figured out already.", "My dad is also covertly racist, but he has been unlearning the beliefs he grew up with. It's a fact that he didn't really spend time around any POC until he left his small, white town at 18.\n\nHe still says racist shit occasionally, and I call him out on it. Same with sexist shit. He has accepted that he has white cishet privileges, and is actively learning about and listening to the experiences of marginalized communities.\n\nWe have no idea if OP's FIL is putting in that work or not. And OP needs to acknowledge that his wife just heard her husband say out loud the shit that misogynists say.", "He gave her an out. This whole cut off the father situation didn't happen while she was already pregnant. She made an active decision before they got married and started trying to have a kid. If she didn't think she could handle cutting off her dad, she could have said so and everyone probably would have been fine with that. But that's not what she did so she's the one who's walking back her agreement as to who should be around their family.", "It was her idea!!!!!", "Funny story, I have cut off my family. I'm not welcome around them because I won't tolerate the racist bullshit anymore. They were the family I grew up with. It was not a hard decision to make. And I'm not even in an interracial marriage.", "If op\nHas proof of his bigotry he can actually have it spelled out that grandfather has no interaction with the child and of mom does jot fallow this she will be held in contempt", "Personally I wouldn\u2019t be letting *any* child of mine around a racist", "My cousins grandmother on his side actually told my cousin she could accept him being gay\u2026but did he have to date a black guy?? People are so gross.", "Racists don't even see black people as people, so what is the problem here?", "We should but wife did not say her dad wanted to apologize.  Forgiven requires amends and FIL needs to do the work before he can be allowed.  The problem with the apologist is that you all want to assume they changed without evidence.  If he truelynchangrd in wife would have stated it.  The FIL would want to meet with his daughter's whole family.  No he just wants his grandchild.  Yes people can change, but you don't get a pass on past behavior.  Like it or not, if you have offended someone and then learned the error of your ways then it is your responsibility to prove it and make your amends.  You don't need any more proof than FIL does not want to see the entire family and wife was sneaking around to meet him", "Absolutely agree. I make jokes to my friends sometimes and they say like to say \"oh, you just hate white people\" and my response is often \"I'm not racist. Some of my best friends are white\". I get a kick out of it and laugh at my own joke but, it's always extra funny to see the uncomfortable faces certain others make and conveniently points them out for me to make similar jokes around. Kill them with uncomfortable comedy. I leave happy and they leave without being able to add passive aggressive comments cause I used most of them against them.", "You sound like very reasonable people! Lol! I know everything is \"good\" or \"bad\" on the internet. No shades of gray. No middle ground. It's so weird to me. I don't feel I run into these people too often in real life that don't take nuance or certain situations into account. It's like \"bad thing\" but it doesn't matter if it wasn't a HUGE thing or if someone is ignorant or if they're sorry, getting better or whatever. Yeah, if something is egregious then \"bad\". But overall everything is so extreme.\n\nUnless I missed it, I think OP said FIL made \"strange comments\" about his son. That's not okay! But I was wondering if FIL was ignorant but willing to learn or is FIL racist? It doesn't sound like there was any convo before cutting off (maybe it warranted that because he called the kid a slur, idk!). But it's easy for OP to cut off and be done. This is her father. What if he's sorry? What if he's a better person? She's pregnant and I'd imagine that makes you think about your parents. I think she should've told OP but he's reaction was pretty awful. I'd imagine this is why she didn't feel comfortable telling him sooner.", "I try not to read too much into these posts but honestly I agree. It's way too convenient. Cuts him off, is fine with that through dating, engagement and wedding planning but suddenly once she's pregnant and OP can't just dump her and get his kid out of there she's chatting to dad and surprised OP is upset"]}
