I have a six year old son that started living with me as his primary guardian when he was three and his mom went back to school. I met my wife through work, and I also met her father, who worked at the same company in a higher role than both of us. My wife knew I had a son, but I said I wouldn't introduce them unless we became a serious couple, because that wouldn't be fair to him.\n\nWhen my wife did meet my son, they got along really well. I invited her and her father over for dinner one night, and her father met my son for the first time. He was weird and awkward around my son and made strange comments about his appearance (his mom is black). I confronted him after the dinner, and he made some pretty pathetic excuses. After that I asked him to not contact me outside of work matters and asked her for space.\n\nA couple weeks later, my wife told me she had completely cut her father off for his beliefs. Our relationship became stronger than ever. When we got engaged she said she didn't want her father at the wedding. We ended up both transferring to other companies. As far as I knew he was gone from both of our lives for good.\n\nMy wife is pregnant and due in a month. She has already started maternity leave and has been looking for a new job to start after maternity leave because she doesn't want to stay at her current company. Yesterday she sat me down and told me her dad got her an interview for a job at our old company. She also told me she has been talking to him for a couple months and wants to know how I would feel about him knowing our future child.\n\nI told her the truth. I told her I felt betrayed and I felt like she betrayed my son, who she claimed to think of as her son as well. I told her that she would even ask me that makes her less of a person in my eyes. She started crying and asked me what kind of insensitive jerk would call the woman pregnant with his kid less of a person. I told her that was how I felt, and although the language was harsh, I felt it matched what she was asking for.\n\nAfter cooling off, I'm now unsure if my word choice was warranted and wondering if I was an asshole for speaking to her that way while she is pregnant and more emotionally vulnerable. I could have just said I wasn't okay with what she was proposing without insulting her character.", "created_utc": 1675781245, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10w3lzx/aita_for_making_my_pregnant_wife_cry_by_calling/", "score": 786, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As the saying goes, if there's a racist at the table with ten other people, you have eleven racists. Your father\u2013in\u2013law has shown he's a racist. Even your wife knows that her dad is a racist as she had cut him off. Your father\u2013in\u2013law has not made any demonstration of repentance; yet your wife wants to invite that toxic presence into your home where it can poison your eldest child. What did she expect you to do and say?\n\nYour right that your words were harsh. But harsh was appropriate. It takes a lesser person to want to invite toxicity into the home, and that's what your wife did. She is the one who needs to apologize for even the suggestion of her father coming back into your personal lives. That she's pregnant is not an excuse for the ***extreme*** breach of trust she committed.\n\n**EDIT:** Some people are claiming that you are just as bad as your father\u2013in\u2013law. That's incorrect. Your father\u2013in\u2013law is a racist. You are opposing racism and keeping it out of your personal space. There is no moral equivalence.", "Everyone in these comments saying Y-T-A have obviously never gone through a similar situation. \n\nYou didn\u2019t call her less of a person, you said you saw her as less. Meaning the view you had of her before, you see her as a lesser standard now. She betrayed your trust. She didn\u2019t communicate with you until she had already followed through. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA imo", "NTA.. I was expecting to be calling you an asshole from the title but your FIL is racist AF. Racism is a non-negotiable.\n\nYour wife is willing to tolerate it because while she gets it \u201cin theory\u201d she doesn\u2019t really.  I look 100% white but I am not, my oldest daughter does not look white and she is not my husband\u2019s biological child. If my in-laws had treated her any different than any other child in the family they would be gone and I would be out so fast if my husband thought that relationship was more important than a child. \n\nIf your FIL came to you both and said he has done the work and realized he was wrong\u2026 and shown that he meant it, that would be a completely different conversation and you\u2019d be the asshole but that isn\u2019t what happened, your wife is willing to tolerate a racist.", "I honestly don't know if I can give a judgement but the people here saying OP is just as bad as his FIL for what he said is batshit insane to me. Harsh? Sure. But a grown man being openly racist toward a child is not even close to what OP said. I can't fault OP for his disappointment in his wife", "NTA\n\nMy husband is biracial and I am Black. We had to cut his mom off (all her kids have at some point) for a while because she would just say off the wall racist shit and act stupid when confronted. She also very obviously treated the 2 Black DIL\u2019s worse than the non Black one. \n\nWe have a baby due this summer. We both have parental trauma and have both lost a parent. My husband and I had a discussion around if and what having his mom in our and our baby\u2019s life.\n\nThe fact is, his grandchild is going to have a biracial sibling. If he can\u2019t treat them both equitably then it\u2019s fair to keep them out of their life. \n\nIf you have never experienced anti-Black racism, you wouldn\u2019t get it. It\u2019s never the overt things that jar you, it\u2019s the little things. As someone raised in white foster homes, WHEW. \n\nYou are protecting both of your children. That being said, you should be open to discussing reconciliation and what that looks like", "NTA, harsh wording? Yeah, but you stated that SHE decided to cut him off, for being racist/his beliefs. Then decided to get back in contact with him without telling you. \n\nI am surprised by the Y T A\u2019s when situations are reversed and it\u2019s a MIL not respecting boundaries or even making racist statements people are so quick to call out the husband for not having a spine, not putting his family first etc. why is this different bc she is pregnant? I have had 4 kids and at no point did that make me want to associate with people who think that way\u2026\u2026", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Y-T-A judgements are missing the point that you want to protect your son from racist bigots and assumed your wife wanted to do the same. The father never even offered an apology.  What are you meant to do? Let a man back into your life who spewed racist shit towards your son and showed no remorse for it? While what you said was bad, what she did was worse. You can apologise for the choice of words, but if I were you I would stand by the decision not to want anything to do with FIL. What that constitutes is up to you.", "Maybe harsh, but honestly nta. You\u2019re protecting your kid and not accepting compromise with people who won\u2019t do the same.", "NTA because you are protecting your child from a racist. Which is what it basically boils down to. If he comes back into her life he will treat the oldest as a 2nd class citizen and that is not fair to your child. Call her out on giving her racist father a pass", "NTA. Hopefully your wife will decline any job offer from the old company. No reason to allow that garbage into or even near your family.", "NTA \n\nYou want your son protected from a racist and continued the relationship with your wife under the belief that she felt the same way. Now it turns out she does not and betrayed you and your son. She should be crying. Her pregnancy doesn't negate her choices.", "NTA. She\u2019s willing to forget and forgive a racist man that looks down on a child she claims to love. It\u2019s ok though because he would never treat HER pure child that way. \n\nOP you\u2019re having a child with this woman so this is going to be one of those pick your battle moments. Is this a hill you\u2019re willing to die on? Because even if you split she\u2019s definitely going to allow her father a relationship with your child. \n\nI would sit and talk with her and post some scenarios about if your father made disparaging comments about her child how would she feel and would she think twice to allow them in her life.", "Oh come on with all of the Y-T-A\u2019s in here; OP is NTA for stating a fact, that his wife wanting her racist dad back in their lives (which includes the life of his mixed child) not because he\u2019s seen the error of his ways and apologized, but because she\u2019s pregnant, does tarnish her image in his eyes and make her less than the woman he thought she was.  \nDon\u2019t defend racists and their enablers. Being pregnant does not make you immune from valid criticism, it doesn\u2019t make a special exception for allowing racism in your life, and it doesn\u2019t mean you can do whatever you want when you want it because you just feel like it. Like, has anyone read what the grandfather said to make OP write him off after a single dinner? You\u2019d really be okay with that person being around your kid after asking if the mom was in prison, implying that black kids have poor hygiene, and saying that you don\u2019t seem like the type to mix with \u201cthose people\u201d? You\u2019d just sit back and keep your mouth shut so a pregnant woman doesn\u2019t get her feelings hurt?", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Were your words a little harsh? Mmmm, maaaaybe, but if that\u2019s how you feel why should you lie to her? Her being pregnant doesn\u2019t give her a pass to go behind your back, does it?! NO!!! Her dad is a blatant racist, unless he changed? Did she mention that at all? Or is he still the same guy he always was and now because she\u2019s pregnant she\u2019s rethinking her NC relationship with him? \n\nIt seems like she should have just talked with you about all this before acting on it, because now you\u2019re left feeling hurt and betrayed and I totally get that. Do you owe it to her to apologize for your hurtful words? I think so, absolutely. But you\u2019re right to not want racists in your life, even by extension. She is ok with racists in her life, apparently. Everyone has to make choices.", "NTA your racist FIL should never be around your children again after his vile comments at that meeting. He verbally associated your young child with prison and filth! It is also vile that your wife asked about FIL being in your younger child\u2019s life specifically, not the elder. She\u2019s allowing him to make a distinction and divide in your family. She did betray you by secretly meeting with him for months. Your word choice was not the best, but her actions led you to respect her less. Focusing on your \u201cinsensitive\u201d reaction rather than her actions is a way to deflect. Ultimately this does speak to her character and what she is willing to condone.", "NTA your wife\u2019s father thinks of your son as less than a person. You initially wanted to break up with your wife so you would not expose your biracial child to racists. She said she would cut her dad off and you continued the relationship based on that promise. Now that you are married with a kid on the way, ie stuck, she let you know she actually didn\u2019t cut her dad off as promised. She expects him to have a relationship with the child you have together but what about your oldest son? Who is going to protect him in this situation? Your wife betrayed you. Your wording was harsh but your wife did go back on her word. Now you\u2019re in a lose lose situation where your oldest will either be exposed to racists or excluded from the extended family while your other child will be included but also exposed to racists.", "NTA - unless he has completely undone his racist ways you were harsh but not wrong.", "NTA. You could have been more sympathetic to your wife\u2019s situation, but you absolutely don\u2019t have to tolerate racists or racist sympathizers in your life.", "I go against the majority here and say NTA. \n\nBc everybody, pregnant or not, who would ask me \"hey, can we let this racist father of mine back in our lifes so he can have a relationship with my kid, oc only the white one\" is automatically an asshole and i would maybe also react with harsh words (ok, not the words you used and you should maybe apologize for it). I would make it VERY clear to her that only bc you guys are married and having a baby together does NOT mean your son will be less of a priority to you and at least as long he is a minor you will priorize protecting him from racists higher than her needs for getting back in contact with her dad.", "NTA\nMaybe you could have used different words. However, it does take a weak person to cave and bring a racist person back into your child's life.", "ESH. I get you, i\u2019d be mad too. I mean what would happen down the line when her father is in the presence of both kids, but treats your son differently? I feel like your feelings of betrayal are valid at this moment, but I do think that it was an asshole move to call her less of a person. It\u2019s her father and I get wanting to have him back in her life. You both could\u2019ve had a more constructive conversation about this, regarding expectations moving forward and her dad\u2019s behavior towards both kids.", "NTA Your word choice was not ideal but if someone asks how you would feel about something and you proceed to tell them how you would feel, and they get upset about the answer that's on them.", "NTA, she asked you how you felt and you were honest with her. Sometimes being blunt is effective at getting your feelings across.", "NTA every step forward you've taken was on the basis you were on the same page about this. I'm horribly disgusted for you.", "NTA she\u2019s okay with talking to her racist dad and that means she\u2019s okay with betraying your son. I\u2019d divorce over it tbh.", "NTA - You're protecting your children. People are acting like being called \"less of a person\" is the worst thing; it's not being welcoming to a racist is.", "ESH. She should have told you that she was talking to her dad and looking for a job at the old company. However, you way overreacted. She cut off someone very important to her. Even if it was for a very good reason, that\u2019s definitely not easy. And now, she\u2019s pregnant and emotional. Of course she is feeling emotional about her family. Have you talked about what she and her dad have been talking about. Has he apologized? Is he working on changing and becoming a better person?", "Nta", "NTA. Protect both of those kids from this kind of nonsense. I see this playing out with her father making his bio grandson feel superior over his younger sibling the same way gramps thought he was superior enough to make those comments. Stand your ground against racism especially when it comes to your kids. She was raised by that man.. keep that in mind, so it was easier for her to forgive him because your son isn\u2019t hers.", "As a human whose grandmother was a racist and I still loved her I say you need to apologize for how said it. Not for how you feel.", "As a native person, who has dealt with racist AHs before. I will say this. I understand that your protecting your son. But I will say the \u201cless of a person\u201d thing irked me. Because that is something that was said to me by a racist. You are a good parent for defending your son. But do me a personal favor. And don\u2019t use phrases like that in an argument. No one, should ever be told they are less of a person. I\u2019m going to go with NTA because you are defending your son. But you need to be more careful with your words, apologize to your wife, tell her that wasn\u2019t what you meant. And try to explain to her calmly why having this man in your lives is a bad idea.

There is a chance the father has grown since then and gotten over his beliefs but I'm far too pessimistic to believe he has.", "Here's the deal:  Her father will never regard your son as a real grandchild.  He will probably shower attention and gifts on his \"real\" grandchild and ignore your son.

She needs to hear your true feelings. It's ok to tell her that her choices have lead to you seeing her a different way. You also have to own up to your feelings. Exactly how do you feel about her now, and how is it different from before exactly? If I were to guess, a large part of this may be the loss of trust, and no longer feeling on the same page about things.

What I assume you meant with that was that your respect for her has dropped because she won't prioritise your child over her father's ignorant and racist ideas. You probably could have worded this a lot better, and should have led with the racists remarks being a deal breaker before. Still, I don't feel like you are the asshole here.\n\nThe reason I say that is because the argument you had was valid, she wants to welcome someone back into your life who has been highly disrespectful to your biracial son. For me (not a POC) that would be reason enough to keep them out of my life.\nAlso, the fact that during these months of reconciliation between your wife and FIL he has never reached out to you with an apology for his past behaviour, which tells me more than enough. If he was regretful of his past racist views and comments he would have already contacted you about this.\n\nI'm sorry OP but this is going to be a huge shitshow. Your wife is pregnant so probably feels validated in her decision to involve her father because \"FaMiLY iS FaMiLY\" \ud83d\ude44. You're going to be the one who has to look out for your sons wellbeing, so you have every right to not want that man in his life. \n\nThese Y T A verdicts are apparently all ignoring the racist aspect of this situation, and focussing on the wrong things. While you can't stop your wife from engaging with him, the fact that she disregards everything shows what kind of person she is. You can try and explain this again to her, but if she doesn't want to hear it, she actively chooses to ignore this behaviour and that makes her an enabler.\n\nEDIT: REPOSTING A COMMENT OF THE OP HERE ABOUT SOME OF THE RACIST REMARKS MADE:\n\n>Basically, when he met my son, he said \"I wasn't expecting that\" and asked \"is his mom in prison?\" (Which is so, so ironic.)

If FIL wants to change, he can pick up a book not a baby", "I feel like we're splitting hairs at this point. Call it a boundary or call it an ultimatum. I am unwilling to risk this man being around my black son.", "..it literally isn\u2019t. \n\nIf the wife cheated with her best friend, and then told OPA it\u2019s been a while and I feel like I want to reestablish that relationship, the wife has every right to do that, however hope he has the right to set a boundary that the reconciliation of that relationship would mean the end of theirs. \n\nIt is not an ultimatum it\u2019s a choice.\n\nThe wife on her own elected to cut contact with her father and family. \n\nThe wife elected onto herself to not invite her father or family to her wedding.\n\nSo this is her electing to allow them back. She is allowed to do that. And OP is allowed to protect his child from their bigotry.", "Nice reply there. It\u2019s super telling that you have no arguments. Just insults.", "No, every thing you said here was factually wrong.\n\nRacism is not \"reacting badly.\"\n\nThat diminishes what is happening and you know it does. \n\nSecond, \"judging someone's appearance\" and \"racism\" are in NO WAY the same thing.", "Then damn near every white person in America must be racist because the amount of racist apologist that exist in real life (because y\u2019all are only this hold on Reddit) is astounding! \n\nY\u2019all don\u2019t hold racist accountable in real life so stop it.", "I\u2019m so glad that was so easy for you. And I\u2019m glad that you never looked back. \n\nNo I don\u2019t lie to my partner. And this is not a clear lie. Sounds like you need to sit with why you have such visceral reactions and you\u2019re so easily at the ready to cut people off. \n\nAs for me, it took a lot of time for me to come to grips with what my life would look like without my parents when I got ready to come out to them. I knew that it may mean that they would no longer be apart of my life. Which was a lot, considering the only thing they had ever done to me was not be as accepting of my sexuality. So yea, it was hard. And thankfully it didn\u2019t come to that. \n\nBut I\u2019m glad your situation came out fine.", "I don\u2019t believe you.", "I think there was a lot of room between \u201ccut off family members\u201d and \u201cprioritize OP,\u201d and it could\u2019ve started with setting healthier boundaries. \n\nIf the root of her cutting her father off wasn\u2019t about racism what I would see is a woman who left her family, quit her job, and completely devoted herself to this man and his son without looking back because he was gonna leave her. \n\nAnd the moment she brings it up he calls her less of a person\u2026 this is not a black and white situation.", "That\u2019s a fucking pathetic interpretation of my comment. I\u2019m not \u201cworried\u201d he\u2019ll be single \u2014 I KNOW he\u2019ll be single. And for what? Did the wife say she wanted to include her dad in their shared lives like nothing happened? We have no clue what she wanted because OP made sure to hurt her so she\u2019d never ask again. That\u2019s not a marriage. Even if OP\u2019s answer was still \u201cno\u201d a real husband talks about it.", "Was there a separate comment or something I missed where OP said that his wife is addressing the racism with her father? Like why is everyone assuming that because they\u2019re back in contact it has to mean that her father has seen the error of his ways? Like that\u2019s not how people who have realized that they\u2019re wrong for being racist try to fix things.", "Call it whatever you want. You\u2019re doing the right thing by protecting your child from a racist.\n\nBut, I\u2019m not sure you can walk back calling your wife less of a person. Not that I\u2019m saying you need to walk it back. The insult was justified. To me, if you\u2019re saying stuff like that to your SO, the relationship is pretty close to being over if it isn\u2019t already over. \n\nEither way, do what\u2019s right by you and your child. You both don\u2019t deserve to be involved with a racist just because he\u2019s your wife\u2019s dad. NTA", "Then why didn't you just tell her that? \n\nI'm so wildly confused as to why you told your pregnant wife you view her as less than a person when you could have said \"hey, I'm really hurt by that shit\". I would say 'youre less than me/a person' to my enemy, never a person I chose to have a child with.", "As I said on another comment it\u2019s both, I\u2019m not trying to be antagonistic I\u2019m just trying to explain to you that you\u2019re telling her it\u2019s your way or the highway. Again it\u2019s understandable but I think you\u2019re probably better off filing for divorce now if there\u2019s no middle ground or compromise. Even if she agrees to not contact him, you probably won\u2019t believe her and she will probably resent you for not letting her give him another chance. However it should be pointed out that your kid with her will have a relationship with their grandparents if that\u2019s what she wants and you won\u2019t be there to mediate.", "Would it be so bad, if your wife sees her family without you or your kids?", "I've never insulted you once, you have though. So nice projection. I'm sorry me pointing out the truth about your character hurts your feelings though.", "[removed]", "While normally I would agree that there are comprises to be found, I do not believe that is the case here for multiple reason. One, racism isn\u2019t something you can reason with. Someone inherently thinking that whole classes of people are below them because of how they were born is not something that can or should be ignored. And here\u2019s the second reason, OP made his boundary very clear at the start of their relationship. Why should he have to change his boundaries?\n\nOf course she is welcome to get back in contact with her father. But it really should not surprise her if OP leaves her, since he\u2026 ya know\u2026 made it clear from the start that it wasn\u2019t acceptable to him and it was fine for them to just end the relationship.", "Okay, so I\u2019d genuinely like to know what the middle ground on relationships with bigots is?? Like what exactly does that look like?? People make it seems as it bigotry is something that sits on the sidelines and only pops out to effect people when the baddies tell it to. Like why does OP owe chancing his child\u2019s psychological safety within their family to this bigot who\u2019s already been cut out.\n\nShe knew about this man\u2019s black son, something and someone who will literally never change, and has now decided that \u2018well it won\u2019t be that bad, I mean at least not for me or my kid\u2019 and OP is just supposed to ok that???", "Who cares what you want to call it. When it comes to allowing a racist into your childs life, who is a person of colour, it is most definitely his way or the highway. Why are you so hung up on him forcing his wife to decide between her racist father or the father of her future child? OP is making the right choice in protecting his child.", "There is no middle ground or compromise for racists. OP has a responsibility to protect his children. I find it interesting your user name is \u201cThe Super Ally\u201d but you\u2019re advocating finding a compromise that would involve exposing children to racists.", "Except she wants to introduce their kid to a racist, so she's already pushing for a relationship between their kids and her dad.", "Yes. \n\nMy cousins, with whom I have deep & very solid relationships with but are still only my cousins, not a life partner, still have a relationship (albeit strained & superficial) with my homophobic (& narcissistically abusive) mother who refuses to acknowledge my existence & routinely discusses myself & my kid in a negative light & won\u2019t invite us to family functions. \n\nIt is very very very hard to look past them giving her & the other bigots in our family their time & space. And they are boat steadiers so advocating for myself & my kid doesn\u2019t happen either. \n\nIt\u2019s something I have to actively, daily, push outta my emotional center due to how much I value our relationship/s & bc I know it took me more decades than they\u2019ve been alive to fully stand up to my mother with my words and actions. It\u2019s something I work on with my therapist as well bc the pain their relationship/s with them cause me is very deep & has utterly broken my heart at times. \n\nAnd they are just my cousins. I cannot even fathom the amount of pain I would feel if I had a spouse that did the same. I would not be able to stay in that marriage for myriad reasons. I would not even have the capacity to continue to love someone that chose a relationship with a bigot over my [queer] child [of color]. \n\nI won\u2019t even make friends with bigots. If someone reveals their bigotry after we\u2019ve become friendly, that friendship is over. \n\nTypically the current elders in our society that are like OP\u2019s bigot-in-law have zero interest in changing their views & even if they put up appearances, the bigotry is still there, especially the systemic bigotry they refuse to acknowledge even exists. So I don\u2019t give much weight to the bigot-in-law \u201cchanging,\u201d they\u2019re just putting on a show (if even, bc wife is probably just spit shining his current behavior). \n\nSo yes. It would be so bad if OP\u2019s wife gives bigots the time of day, whether OP has a Black child or not tbh. If you make nice with bigots, you\u2019re gonna get their putrid existential stink all over you."]}
