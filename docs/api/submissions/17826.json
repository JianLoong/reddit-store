The family that Miranda removed herself and Maggie from that you are a part of will all be there for your wedding and Maggie can\u2019t handle it. Maggie is living the result of Miranda\u2019s choices and you shouldn\u2019t constantly have to feel like it\u2019s your fault every time you have to be around them.

Why would she be given heirloom jewellery when Miranda has made it clear Maggie isn\u2019t part of their family?  Their expectations were unrealistic in the first place.", "As much as you took it too far, NTA.\n\nWhen you do nothing but keep comparing stuff and creating unnecessary statements that are so passive-aggressive, anyone would be pissed off here.\n\nApologizing is highly encouraged, although it requires a lot of swallowing pride.

I had 5 step siblings that, like you, I never really lived with and while we got on ok, they would never have expected my father\u2019s family to show up to their family events. My dad went as their mum\u2019s husband, but no one else. \n\nThey were also significantly wealthier than us (my mother and my siblings), both because their mother\u2019s family had money and because my dad was wealthier by the time he and his second wife got together. We got some perks from that (my dad was generous later in life), but I had a small wedding at home while my step siblings had six-figure weddings at country clubs, resorts and one at the NY Public Library.  That\u2019s just how it is. Some families have more $ than others.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re still an AH. Not THE AH, because she was an AH first, but definitely an AH. You should apologize, not to keep the peace but because it was an unkind thing to say. Tell her what you told us. That it\u2019s hurtful that she\u2019s using your wedding as a way to air her grievances (especially that crack about how she should have married your fianc\u00e9 which is disrespectful not only to you, but also her own husband. Seriously big yuck on that comment). Then let it go. If she won\u2019t, then drop her with no remorse.", "NTa. People didn't care about her wedding. It's the truth.

You've been ranting about this nonstop. It's getting boring.\"\n\nThat said, this part really struck me as a particularly awful thing for Maggie to say.\n\n>She has gone so far as to say that she should have married my fianc\u00e9 since she\u2019s closer in age to him and they \u201cskipped\u201d her (she believes my marriage was arranged).\n\nDid she ever say this in front of her husband? Is this to say she would prefer your fianc\u00e9 to her own husband?\n\nIf I were her husband, I'd be very concerned about this.\n\nETA: Some of the other stuff that she complains about, I think are unwarranted. But I'd like some INFO: Why should her stepfather offer to pay for her wedding? Where is her father? Are her parents divorced or is he deceased?\n\nAs for the heirloom jewelry, I think she's being ridiculous about that. I assume this jewelry came from your parents' family. Why should she be offered heirloom jewelry from a family that isn't hers? As for the extended family that chose not to attend her wedding, would that be the same extended family that she intentionally chose to distance herself from?\n\nI get that this can be frustrating for stepchildren, especially since there's an obvious income disparity operating here. But on the other hand, Miranda and Maggie intentionally chose to not to connect with your family. And maybe it is difficult for them, but I assume that Miranda did not marry into this family ignorant of what she was getting into.", "YTA. She has obvious issues with not feeling important in the family and your response it to tell her in front of everyone no one cares about her. \nShame on you. You could gave handled this a million different ways and this is the way you chose.", "ESH, just apologize and move on. You didn\u2019t specify the \u201cchip\u201d they hold about the dads side of the family, but he\u2019s still a father figure for her too.

It\u2019s always possibly to ask someone to move on kindly, and have a conversation privately.", "ESH - whilst I understand your frustration you were incredibly mean to your stepsister who is clearly feeling vulnerable about her place in your fathers family.

A simple \u2018can we stop comparing weddings it isn\u2019t a competition\u2019 would have sufficed. Saying no one cares is rude and incredibly mean. I do think you owe her an apology for that.\n\nThat said your stepsister is also spectacularly obnoxious in all her other complaints. And the finance comment was outrageous, your dad needs to have a word with his wife and put a stop to all that. Should be made clear to your stepsister that this wedding is not about her and if she can\u2019t just be happy for you then might be best she doesn\u2019t attend.", "ESH yuck.", " kinda TA because that was not the way to address it lol \nAlthough she sounds super salty about the past and didnt have to be so passive aggressive . If she wanted to talk she couldve instead of dropping comments like that. Apologise to keep the peace but in all wouldnt give her the time of day. She seems insecure and perhaps other lingering emotions that she needs to confront.", "YTA. Listen to your dad. What you did was inappropriate and unnecessarily mean.", "Esh for being awful humans", "I almost want to say that everyone's the asshole in this situation. I might not word this the best so forgive me for that but, but her behaviour what was she expected to have happened, eventually acting that way in front of people is eventually going to rile someone up to the point that someone does exactly what you did or people start going no contact with people who behave in such a manner because they just can't seem to better themselves. So in a way I want to say you're a justified asshole in the situation given her behaviour. Ultimately it would have been nice if Maggie came to you and privately talked to you about all her concerns in an emotionally mature way but I simply don't believe the woman is currently capable of providing that currently to anyone given her behaviour. I would say it might be wise to apologize but at the same time given what I've read here I don't believe an apology will lead you to a place where her actions won't repeat again. I think over all she really needs to be emotionally vulnerable with you so you both understand each other to move forward but that might genuinely be expecting too much out of Maggie given her clear lack of emotional maturity especially for her age. But hey you know her better than I do and if you believe you can have a heart to heart with her and truly make amends then do it otherwise I'd say it might be wise to go no contact from here on out since she cannot respect you in any way shape or form.", "YTA.  You just had to rub it in Maggie\u2019s face that she\u2019s a second-class citizen in the family; didn\u2019t you.", "Edit to ESH based on OPs response. Maggie came into this family at 12 - not super young but still a child. It\u2019s obvious she has resentment of not feeling welcome into the family and you seem either completely oblivious or part of that OP. Dads aren\u2019t obligated to pay for their daughter\u2019s weddings but the fact that your Dad is the type to offer and didn\u2019t offer to contribute at all to the woman whose life he has been in since she was 12 is pretty hurtful; it makes we wonder what it was like for Maggie to live with him. That said Maggie is now a grown married lady, she needs to get therapy if she needs it and move on with her life. She shouldn\u2019t be bringing up bitterness from her own wedding every time you mention yours but you OP could also learn a little grace and understanding. I do think you owe her an apology for your out of line blowup. \n\nInfo: \n\nHow long have your Dad and Miranda been married? What\u2019s the deal with the extended family? These answers make the difference between ESH and YTA.", "ESH.\n\nMaggie has a whole bunch of issues. She's bitter about how the family has treated her. Whether her bitterness is justified is not for me to judge, but it is inappropriate for her to hijack a dinner party to air her grievances.\n\nHowever, you know what she's like. You knew there was a good chance she will cause some kind of scene. There are other ways you could have handled it. You could have said \"Maggie, I realize you're still upset, but now isn't the time or place. We're trying to have a pleasant evening here. Let's talk about this another time.\" Or you could have decided not to attend this dinner at all, knowing she would be there. Instead, you attended, you let her get under your skin, and you retaliated by being gratuitously mean.\n\nI understand the impulse to be mean. I have a sister who has been a pain in the ass for more than 50 years. She has created a scene similar to Maggie's at just about every family get-together we've ever had. Often she has to leave these functions early, because she works a job where she has to wake up at 4:30am, so she can't do late nights. After she walks out the door and gets in her car, everyone cheers. Literally cheers. They all find her as irritating as I do, but none of them are prepared to say so to her face. I used to say so, decades ago, but then I realized I was behaving as badly as she was. She got under my skin, so I retaliated. I tried to tell myself my nastiness was justified because she started it, but the fact was, I didn't like the person I was becoming when I was around her.\n\nSo how do I deal with her now? I go to as few family functions as possible where I know she is invited. I still see my other family members; I just get together with them in smaller, separate groups that don't include my sister. Sometimes my attendance is unavoidable (e.g. Christmas, or a wedding), but on these occasions the gathering is large enough that I can position myself as far away as possible from her, and there are usually plenty of people in between. In that way, I can nearly always avoid exchanging more than a dozen words with her. If she starts creating a scene, I leave the room.\n\nYou can find a way of dealing with Maggie if you need to, even if that way is by avoiding her. Don't let her bad behavior become an excuse for your own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like Maggie and Miranda have been bringing up their feelings about your Dad's family for awhile now. You spent a good chunk of time escaping to your Dad's family.

She and her mom always distsnced themselves from the family, why did she wanted them at the wedding in the first place?", "I guess they don't because OP didn't mention anyone standing up for her. How sad.", "Actually, she's been rubbing it in everyone's faces since the day I got engaged.", "They've been married for 12 years, together 15.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"deal\", and which extended family are you referring to? If you mean the ones who didn't attend Maggie's wedding and you're asking why, we're not especially close to them, see them maybe three times a year, they all live in different parts of the world...not sure what else to add?", "OP behaviour was extremely bad as well especially what she said. I have no issues with her saying something to her but it\u2019s how she said it it was cruel and downright mean. No excuse for it and it makes her TA.", "Most likely because step sister and mum never wanted to attend events with Op's father side of the family. If they never cared about them, why should they care about her wedding?", "Maybe she wanted her husband only to focus on her and her kid, instead of him spending time with his family. Maybe she tried to cause a rift in op's relationship with her dad, and the family didn't stood for it. \n\n>now is actively participating in perpetuating it.\n\nBy ... having her family at a wedding and wearing family jewels??", "Okay, let\u2019s roll with what you said. That, that\u2019s how it played out. Tell me how that is OPs fault when she was a child when it started and then Miranda removed herself from the situation so OP didn\u2019t even interact with them? Tell me how OP should be blamed for any of it bc even if we go with your way of how it played out it still isn\u2019t OPs fault, it\u2019s her dads. He was TA who let his new family get treated that way. He is the one who let the division happen (I mean either way he is guilty of this one). He was the one who didn\u2019t offer for Maggie\u2019s wedding, that\u2019s on him. So all OP is really guilty of is feeling some strong emotions in a moment of yet again being attacked by Maggie for something that either her step mom or bio dad caused and finally saying something to put Maggie in her place", "I think this is a difficult situation to properly judge.\n\nIt sounds to me as though this bad blood happened when both you and Maggie were young (since you mention in your OP that you 'grew up' pretty much apart from her and your step-mother, and spent a lot of time with your dad's family), so I'm going to be bold and assume that both of you have probably only ever heard one side of this story - one that makes the 'other side' look bad - and the result is that you both don't have very good things to say about each other. \n\nAs to the issue at hand: It is wrong of Maggie to keep on about your dad's extended family not attending her wedding (like, what was she expecting since her mother went nuclear on them) and comparing it to yours, as well as all the other crap she has said, so she's definitely the bigger AH in this situation. However, you could have told her to stop whining without being cruel about it. Telling her that nobody cared and never will care about her wedding was too much and untrue, since I'm certain that there were people at her wedding who clearly *do* care about her. \n\nI can really only conclude that ESH, but with the caveat that this is probably a far more complicated situation than it appears.", "Kind of like how you\u2019re unfavorably judging her?", "Yeah, that\u2019s just weird to me. I would never expect people to treat me the same way they treat their blood relatives even though our parents happened to get married.

That\u2019s like expecting Miranda to offer her heirloom jewelry to OP. OP has her own mother. Meggie has her own father, presumably.", "I wouldn't consider it \"bad blood\" per se. I've only ever heard about why Miranda stopped coming to things from my dad, and he told me not to bring it up to the rest of the family so I don't think they know/care. \n\nPrior to this issue I didn't have anything to say about Maggie at all and I presume she didn't about me, either. I might have been wrong on that score.\n\nBut yeah, people are complicated haha.", "I dont know. I felt when Step sis started saying the husband should have been hers it crossed a major line.....", "It's not a judgement, she really is like that. I'm not saying it makes her a bad person.", "She has been eagerly and constantly been drawing attention to the fact that that is her interpretation.

Then suddenly every time we see her she brings up my wedding just to compare it to hers. That's what I mean.", "No, maggie owes everyone an apology. Especially op for harping about how her wedding is this and that. Is not op's fault that people don't like maggie and didn't want to go to her wedding.", "So basically your step-sister decides to dislike people first before they get the chance to dislike her.

No, her commentary wasn't needed, and someone absolutely needed to tell her to hold her tongue, but publicly telling someone that no one cared about a major moment in their life when it happened and they're not going to start caring now, no matter how true it is, was harsh and hurtful.

It's baffling people can go around not addressing someone's emotions for months on end when they bring something up the first time and then be surprised they're behaving more and more low about it.", "I wish every relationship had this kind of open communication, but the reality is that they don't. This is a situation very unlikely to happen between two step sisters who didn't actually spend that much time together growing up.", "The only person who has ever told me about Miranda disliking the family is my dad, and frankly, considering how much he defends her in literally everything else, I believe him. She was the same to me when I was younger, she would complain to my dad that I didn\u2019t like her just because I would ask to go somewhere with just my dad, or because I wanted to stay with my mother for holidays so I could see my school friends. My dad and I ended up in family therapy because of him trying to cater to her need for attention from everyone around her. She\u2019s got better over the years, as has my dad at dealing with her, but that is how she is in my experience. \n\nMy dad treats Maggie and me differently because I\u2019m his child. There is no other way I can say that, and I know it\u2019s an unpopular thing on Reddit to admit it matters in some blended families, but there it is. My stepdad treats me differently to his sons. It doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t love me, it doesn\u2019t mean my dad doesn\u2019t love Maggie, but not every step-parent relationship develops into an identical parent/child bond. Taboo thing to say maybe but in my experience that\u2019s 80% of blended families. \n\nI\u2019ve said this elsewhere, but the family Maggie is referring to are my dad\u2019s cousins who we see a few times a year and live on different continents.

Maggie seems to have openly said she had an issue with your family not attending her wedding, yet everyone seems to ignore her, probably as someone else said, they genuinely didn't care about it, and in that case of course she'd be upset about it.\n\nThe way you make it sound, it's like everyone including you considers these displays of emotions as a nuisance, instead of seeing it as what it is, a symptom that she's not feeling good/has some issues, etc. What if you were upset, expressed it, and everyone brushed you off, ignored you, and shoved it under the rug until you had no choice but to turn into a bitter and petty, annoying person to get *some* level of validation?", "I'm VERY sensitive & I know others who are also VERY sensitive.

Italian people are from Italy and speak Italian\u2026etc.\n\nWhere are \u201cHindi\u201d people from? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Do you think your stepsister still has any lingering feeling for you fiance or even if she doesn't kinda resents you having getting the thing (i know he is a person) that she never could and is just being a petty child who even though she doesn't want him anymore doesn't want you to have him either?\n\nI have seen some real toxic dynamics like that where someone has zero interest in say a friend but magically shows interest when a third party shows interest and then that interest stops the moment that third party is gone.", "I agreed with the Hindi part, but since you brought it up again. Punjabi, and Gujarati are other ones. Languages, but also the demonym.", "RighteousVengeance   You please me and my long-deceased mother with that semicolon usage!!!!  Thank you for being a light in the darkness of today's either dismal or evolved grammar usage.", "I have family like this. I was a single parent for 4 years before they started having kids and never once got a call or a visit,  now it's all 'where's my village' \nIf you want a village then build one, don't come stomping into mine making demands.", "Thank you.  I will edit my post with the correct names.  I wish you well.", "No but she has to see the context here, that stepsister IS being left out", "No it\u2019s not easy to see that. I dint regularly imagine the fact that someone future husband is from an arranged marriage and that I should be the one to marry them. That is unhinged . She was \"shunned\" bc her mother decided to exclude themselves from those same family members.", "No, she said Miranda had perceived that no one liked her and removed her and her daughter from it. For no reason. That in itself is an insult to her husbands family.\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to care about their feelings at that point. The family probably doesn\u2019t think about them much at all.\n\nIf Maggie wants to talk about not being close to the family she needs to take that up with her petty mother.\n\nYou\u2019re \u201csurmising\u201d and assuming for no reason.", "Then why are you ignoring her crossing every boundaries ti just put it on op. In what word saying she deserved her fianc\u00e9 and it could only be an arrange marriage but vicious and terrible behaviour?", "\"A little extreme\"? She went straight to the most vicious thing she could imagine to say to her stepsister. She literally told her that every fear she had of not being accepted by her step-family was true, rubbed her face in it, in front of the people whose rejection she feared, and NOBODY questioned it. That's the kind of thing that doesn't just end the person's complaining, it ends the relationship completely.", "Hindia", "My exact thought!! Like was Maggie\u2019s husband there?? If I was her husband (and also a man lol) and she said that while I was sitting right there, I\u2019d file for a divorce right away. Definitely NTA", "Because everyone has right to feel whatever emotion rise in them. Processing the emotion is their responsibility.\n\nBut to the point of this story, she has right to be upset that all extended family members don't care. They have right to not care about her. But it is understandable she feels sad and hurt.", "I was really just wondering what the grudge and that Maggie and Miranda had with the family was all about and if it had anything to do with her constant jabs. OP explained it to me so I think her words were harsh but understandable after being provoked so much.", "I also wonder if Maggie was more like collateral damage to her mother's decision to stop attending things.", "Because she was viewing it as an arranged marriage and she is the older sister. You are imposing love marriage standards on an arranged marriage. It's not the same at all. Hence why I said she may have said different if OP had bothered to inform her that it was not in fact an arranged marriage. OP chose not to do this and instead opted to be cruel.", "She said this as the older sister in what she believed was an arranged marriage situation. This is completely different to what happens in love match marriage situations. And she\"d be right, as the older sister she should have the pick of suitors in an arranged marriage environemnt. She was giving another reason she had been slighted, not maligning OP.", "Same. It definitely seems odd that OP describes a chip on the shoulder when it comes to dad's family. It didn't just appear out of nowhere? My inkling is dad's family has been exclusionary and the stepsister is starved for attention from the family. YTA. Op- it is clear no one cared about her or her wedding.", "She made that shit up in her head . Why on earth is it on op to get her out of her delusion ? The only reason she said that was pure jealousy and victimhood mentality", "A reason that did not exist because no one said nor mentioned it was an arranged marriage. Don\u2019t go make lies and then justify your bad actions over something that doesn\u2019t exist. She isn\u2019t right because she is inventing everything", "But that\u2019s not her fault she can\u2019t control other peoples actions and her step sister seems to be taking her frustration out on her. She can\u2019t control that her family shows up for her and not for her step sister. She can\u2019t control that her step mom kept her step sister away from her dads family and that why the family isn\u2019t as close with her. Those things aren\u2019t her fault and her step sister bringing them up constantly isn\u2019t going to do anything to solve the problem it\u2019s just going to drive a wedge between step sister and the dads family.", "Hindi is a language NOT a religion or identity. Neither is Hindi language of South Asia.", "Her victimhood mentality seems pretty justified considering OP confirmed she was right and no one had cared about her wedding.", "I just don't see it as a \"the most vicious thing she could imagine\", especially considering Maggie told OP that she should have married OP's husband instead."]}
