The family that Miranda removed herself and Maggie from that you are a part of will all be there for your wedding and Maggie can\u2019t handle it. Maggie is living the result of Miranda\u2019s choices and you shouldn\u2019t constantly have to feel like it\u2019s your fault every time you have to be around them.

Why would she be given heirloom jewellery when Miranda has made it clear Maggie isn\u2019t part of their family?  Their expectations were unrealistic in the first place.", "As much as you took it too far, NTA.\n\nWhen you do nothing but keep comparing stuff and creating unnecessary statements that are so passive-aggressive, anyone would be pissed off here.\n\nApologizing is highly encouraged, although it requires a lot of swallowing pride.

I had 5 step siblings that, like you, I never really lived with and while we got on ok, they would never have expected my father\u2019s family to show up to their family events. My dad went as their mum\u2019s husband, but no one else. \n\nThey were also significantly wealthier than us (my mother and my siblings), both because their mother\u2019s family had money and because my dad was wealthier by the time he and his second wife got together. We got some perks from that (my dad was generous later in life), but I had a small wedding at home while my step siblings had six-figure weddings at country clubs, resorts and one at the NY Public Library.  That\u2019s just how it is. Some families have more $ than others.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re still an AH. Not THE AH, because she was an AH first, but definitely an AH. You should apologize, not to keep the peace but because it was an unkind thing to say. Tell her what you told us. That it\u2019s hurtful that she\u2019s using your wedding as a way to air her grievances (especially that crack about how she should have married your fianc\u00e9 which is disrespectful not only to you, but also her own husband. Seriously big yuck on that comment). Then let it go. If she won\u2019t, then drop her with no remorse.", "NTa. People didn't care about her wedding. It's the truth.

You've been ranting about this nonstop. It's getting boring.\"\n\nThat said, this part really struck me as a particularly awful thing for Maggie to say.\n\n>She has gone so far as to say that she should have married my fianc\u00e9 since she\u2019s closer in age to him and they \u201cskipped\u201d her (she believes my marriage was arranged).\n\nDid she ever say this in front of her husband? Is this to say she would prefer your fianc\u00e9 to her own husband?\n\nIf I were her husband, I'd be very concerned about this.\n\nETA: Some of the other stuff that she complains about, I think are unwarranted. But I'd like some INFO: Why should her stepfather offer to pay for her wedding? Where is her father? Are her parents divorced or is he deceased?\n\nAs for the heirloom jewelry, I think she's being ridiculous about that. I assume this jewelry came from your parents' family. Why should she be offered heirloom jewelry from a family that isn't hers? As for the extended family that chose not to attend her wedding, would that be the same extended family that she intentionally chose to distance herself from?\n\nI get that this can be frustrating for stepchildren, especially since there's an obvious income disparity operating here. But on the other hand, Miranda and Maggie intentionally chose to not to connect with your family. And maybe it is difficult for them, but I assume that Miranda did not marry into this family ignorant of what she was getting into.", "YTA. She has obvious issues with not feeling important in the family and your response it to tell her in front of everyone no one cares about her. \nShame on you. You could gave handled this a million different ways and this is the way you chose.", "ESH, just apologize and move on. You didn\u2019t specify the \u201cchip\u201d they hold about the dads side of the family, but he\u2019s still a father figure for her too.

It\u2019s always possibly to ask someone to move on kindly, and have a conversation privately.", "ESH - whilst I understand your frustration you were incredibly mean to your stepsister who is clearly feeling vulnerable about her place in your fathers family. You didn\u2019t say how long your dad and his wife been married but sounds like been a while so you can understand why she might be upset about the lack of attendance. A simple \u2018can we stop comparing weddings it isn\u2019t a competition\u2019 would have sufficed. Saying no one cares is rude and incredibly mean. I do think you owe her an apology for that.\n\nThat said your stepsister is also spectacularly obnoxious in all her other complaints. And the finance comment was outrageous, your dad needs to have a word with his wife and put a stop to all that. Should be made clear to your stepsister that this wedding is not about her and if she can\u2019t just be happy for you then might be best she doesn\u2019t attend.", "ESH yuck.", " kinda TA because that was not the way to address it lol \nAlthough she sounds super salty about the past and didnt have to be so passive aggressive . If she wanted to talk she couldve instead of dropping comments like that. Apologise to keep the peace but in all wouldnt give her the time of day. She seems insecure and perhaps other lingering emotions that she needs to confront.", "YTA. Listen to your dad. What you did was inappropriate and unnecessarily mean.", "Esh for being awful humans", "I almost want to say that everyone's the asshole in this situation. I might not word this the best so forgive me for that but, but her behaviour what was she expected to have happened, eventually acting that way in front of people is eventually going to rile someone up to the point that someone does exactly what you did or people start going no contact with people who behave in such a manner because they just can't seem to better themselves. So in a way I want to say you're a justified asshole in the situation given her behaviour. Ultimately it would have been nice if Maggie came to you and privately talked to you about all her concerns in an emotionally mature way but I simply don't believe the woman is currently capable of providing that currently to anyone given her behaviour. I would say it might be wise to apologize but at the same time given what I've read here I don't believe an apology will lead you to a place where her actions won't repeat again. I think over all she really needs to be emotionally vulnerable with you so you both understand each other to move forward but that might genuinely be expecting too much out of Maggie given her clear lack of emotional maturity especially for her age. But hey you know her better than I do and if you believe you can have a heart to heart with her and truly make amends then do it otherwise I'd say it might be wise to go no contact from here on out since she cannot respect you in any way shape or form.", "YTA.  You just had to rub it in Maggie\u2019s face that she\u2019s a second-class citizen in the family; didn\u2019t you.", "Edit to ESH based on OPs response. Maggie came into this family at 12 - not super young but still a child. It\u2019s obvious she has resentment of not feeling welcome into the family and you seem either completely oblivious or part of that OP. Dads aren\u2019t obligated to pay for their daughter\u2019s weddings but the fact that your Dad is the type to offer and didn\u2019t offer to contribute at all to the woman whose life he has been in since she was 12 is pretty hurtful; it makes we wonder what it was like for Maggie to live with him. That said Maggie is now a grown married lady, she needs to get therapy if she needs it and move on with her life. She shouldn\u2019t be bringing up bitterness from her own wedding every time you mention yours but you OP could also learn a little grace and understanding. I do think you owe her an apology for your out of line blowup. \n\nInfo: \n\nHow long have your Dad and Miranda been married? What\u2019s the deal with the extended family? These answers make the difference between ESH and YTA.", "ESH.\n\nMaggie has a whole bunch of issues. She's bitter about how the family has treated her. Whether her bitterness is justified is not for me to judge, but it is inappropriate for her to hijack a dinner party to air her grievances.\n\nHowever, you know what she's like. You knew there was a good chance she will cause some kind of scene. There are other ways you could have handled it. You could have said \"Maggie, I realize you're still upset, but now isn't the time or place. We're trying to have a pleasant evening here. Let's talk about this another time.\" Or you could have decided not to attend this dinner at all, knowing she would be there. Instead, you attended, you let her get under your skin, and you retaliated by being gratuitously mean.\n\nI understand the impulse to be mean. I have a sister who has been a pain in the ass for more than 50 years. She has created a scene similar to Maggie's at just about every family get-together we've ever had. Often she has to leave these functions early, because she works a job where she has to wake up at 4:30am, so she can't do late nights. After she walks out the door and gets in her car, everyone cheers. Literally cheers. They all find her as irritating as I do, but none of them are prepared to say so to her face. I used to say so, decades ago, but then I realized I was behaving as badly as she was. She got under my skin, so I retaliated. I tried to tell myself my nastiness was justified because she started it, but the fact was, I didn't like the person I was becoming when I was around her.\n\nSo how do I deal with her now? I go to as few family functions as possible where I know she is invited. I still see my other family members; I just get together with them in smaller, separate groups that don't include my sister. Sometimes my attendance is unavoidable (e.g. Christmas, or a wedding), but on these occasions the gathering is large enough that I can position myself as far away as possible from her, and there are usually plenty of people in between. In that way, I can nearly always avoid exchanging more than a dozen words with her. If she starts creating a scene, I leave the room.\n\nYou can find a way of dealing with Maggie if you need to, even if that way is by avoiding her. Don't let her bad behavior become an excuse for your own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like Maggie and Miranda have been bringing up their feelings about your Dad's family for awhile now. You spent a good chunk of time escaping to your Dad's family.

She and her mom always distsnced themselves from the family, why did she wanted them at the wedding in the first place?", "I guess they don't because OP didn't mention anyone standing up for her. How sad.", "Actually, she's been rubbing it in everyone's faces since the day I got engaged.", "They've been married for 12 years, together 15.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"deal\", and which extended family are you referring to? If you mean the ones who didn't attend Maggie's wedding and you're asking why, we're not especially close to them, see them maybe three times a year, they all live in different parts of the world...not sure what else to add?", "OP behaviour was extremely bad as well especially what she said. I have no issues with her saying something to her but it\u2019s how she said it it was cruel and downright mean. No excuse for it and it makes her TA.", "Most likely because step sister and mum never wanted to attend events with Op's father side of the family. If they never cared about them, why should they care about her wedding?", "Maybe she wanted her husband only to focus on her and her kid, instead of him spending time with his family. Maybe she tried to cause a rift in op's relationship with her dad, and the family didn't stood for it. \n\n>now is actively participating in perpetuating it.\n\nBy ... having her family at a wedding and wearing family jewels??", "Okay, let\u2019s roll with what you said. That, that\u2019s how it played out. Tell me how that is OPs fault when she was a child when it started and then Miranda removed herself from the situation so OP didn\u2019t even interact with them? Tell me how OP should be blamed for any of it bc even if we go with your way of how it played out it still isn\u2019t OPs fault, it\u2019s her dads. He was TA who let his new family get treated that way. He is the one who let the division happen (I mean either way he is guilty of this one). He was the one who didn\u2019t offer for Maggie\u2019s wedding, that\u2019s on him. So all OP is really guilty of is feeling some strong emotions in a moment of yet again being attacked by Maggie for something that either her step mom or bio dad caused and finally saying something to put Maggie in her place", "I think this is a difficult situation to properly judge.\n\nIt sounds to me as though this bad blood happened when both you and Maggie were young (since you mention in your OP that you 'grew up' pretty much apart from her and your step-mother, and spent a lot of time with your dad's family), so I'm going to be bold and assume that both of you have probably only ever heard one side of this story - one that makes the 'other side' look bad - and the result is that you both don't have very good things to say about each other. \n\nAs to the issue at hand: It is wrong of Maggie to keep on about your dad's extended family not attending her wedding (like, what was she expecting since her mother went nuclear on them) and comparing it to yours, as well as all the other crap she has said, so she's definitely the bigger AH in this situation. However, you could have told her to stop whining without being cruel about it. Telling her that nobody cared and never will care about her wedding was too much and untrue, since I'm certain that there were people at her wedding who clearly *do* care about her. \n\nI can really only conclude that ESH, but with the caveat that this is probably a far more complicated situation than it appears.", "Kind of like how you\u2019re unfavorably judging her?", "Yeah, that\u2019s just weird to me. I would never expect people to treat me the same way they treat their blood relatives even though our parents happened to get married.

That\u2019s like expecting Miranda to offer her heirloom jewelry to OP. OP has her own mother. Meggie has her own father, presumably.", "I wouldn't consider it \"bad blood\" per se. I've only ever heard about why Miranda stopped coming to things from my dad, and he told me not to bring it up to the rest of the family so I don't think they know/care. \n\nPrior to this issue I didn't have anything to say about Maggie at all and I presume she didn't about me, either. I might have been wrong on that score.\n\nBut yeah, people are complicated haha.", "I dont know. I felt when Step sis started saying the hisband should have been hers it crossed a major line.....", "It's not a judgement, she really is like that. I'm not saying it makes her a bad person.", "She has been eagerly and constantly been drawing attention to the fact that that is her interpretation.

Then suddenly every time we see her she brings up my wedding just to compare it to hers. That's what I mean.", "No, maggie owes everyone an apology. Especially op for harping about how her wedding is this and that. Is not op's fault that people don't like maggie and didn't want to go to her wedding.", "So basically your step-sister decides to dislike people first before they get the chance to dislike her.

No, her commentary wasn't needed, and someone absolutely needed to tell her to hold her tongue, but publicly telling someone that no one cared about a major moment in their life when it happened and they're not going to start caring now, no matter how true it is, was harsh and hurtful.

The root of her anger is over her belief that no one in her family cared enough to support her in her wedding and you just told her that it\u2019s true that no one cared and how exactly is she supposed to feel when you said that?  Happy?  Like she deserves to be cared about less?  Why would you say that to her? Why are you surprised that she feels angry and has a hard time being involved with a family that has made it clear that they care less about her?", "Why wasn't Maggie offered the heirlooms?

Do you want to ask your sister if she is ok? Before, during, and after that confrontation were all great times to check in with her and see if she was ok or needed help and support with processing anything.

I'm sorry she has to deal with the lot of you.", "sounds like maggie has felt excluded for her whole life. \n\ni'm sure she's irritating, but it seems as if she's dealing with some pretty serious issues.\n\nNAH", "\"I'm sorry everyone heard me say my true feelings about you \"\nShe is not biologically related to you so you and your family are under no obligations treat you identically.

That was your choice, but you can't expect them to have strong feelings for you when you never had strong feelings for them.\"\n\nBTW, (not that dad should point this out), but it seems the hurt is not at all about \"Oh, step-paternal family didn't care enough to do these nice things for me!\" It seems pretty clear that it's \"Hey, OP is getting these nice gestures and attention. I didn't get that, too. Waaahhh!\"\n\nAlso, please note: most entitled whiners are much more likely to be greatly wounded by one comment from you but can't comprehend that you might have been sick and tired of their relentless barrage. That doesn't mean you have to cater to their claims of victimhood.", "NTA remind your father of everything she has said or did leading up to this moment. Tell him she can dish it out as long as no one snaps back. He may want to tolerate her bad behavior but no one else does any longer. Sadly it may be better if she and probably her mom don\u2019t attend the wedding. She will most definitely do something and only embarrass herself more with bad behavior.

She obviously has a lot of hurt feelings, especially since her stepdad refused to help pay for the wedding, but what you said was beyond rude.

She wasn\u2019t involved with your family, but expected to be praised, gifted, and honored by people she basically ignored. Maggie is stupid and who cares about those tears. How can she manage to be the VILLAIN and the VICTIM at THE SAME DAMN TIME?!!", "ESH. As a step-daughter who is genuinely close to my step-family, I understand why she\u2019s upset. Yes, she took it too far, the passive-aggression was unnecessary, but WOW that comment was uncalled for on your end. She\u2019s already insecure about feeling left out and you really twisted the knife. You could have discussed it in private with her like an adult, but you didn\u2019t. You were both being petty and self-centered, so if you want to be the bigger person, go apologize and have a long talk about why you blew up at her.", "I believe YTA, because you know the family don\u2019t fuck with her like that, and you dug that knife in and twisted because what? She wasn\u2019t even talking shit about you or the wedding. She was talking about her experience with the family.", "ESH.

That was cruel.", "NTA\n\nYour dad didn't see that it was the final straw so to him, it looks like you came at her out of nowhere even if she was still being super rude at the moment.  I wouldn't apologize, obviously, as she had it coming but maybe your dad needs some backstory. He might not care about the backstory, esp since he is closer to her than you are, but even so.", "ESH and just so you know no one cares about yours either.

In a couple months no one will remember any of the details of your wedding.", "NTA - Your Dad is only pressuring you to apologize because Miranda is giving him a hard time.  I'm so sick of AHs being AHs and then when they get a taste of their own medicine they freak out and whine and cry and expect everyone to cater to their hurt feelings.  She humiliated herself.  And she's got some beef with you that has nothing to do with the wedding and she's probably irrationally jealous of you.  She sounds exhausting.  \n\nShe needs to grow up.  Tell you father that you'll sincerely apologize if she first apologizes o you for being mean spirited about your wedding and agrees to stop comparing the two events.", "I'm going to say ESH because even though she kept bringing it up, being passive aggressive, and at inappropriate times, maybe someone should've sat down. But you did humiliate her in front of everyone and you did hit her where it hurts. I think an apology would be a good opportunity to talk to her about how she's feeling, the reality of things, and how she went about to was also inappropriate.", ">obvious Maggie is feeling left out but they need to direct that loss to her mom and not you\n\nMaggie is a goddamned adult and needs to grow TF up.  If this were teenagers andd about some comparable child scenario, I'd agree on attempting niceness and not punishing the step sib. This ain't it. Maggie is nearly thirty and this is toddler behavior. Maggie keeps inserting herself.", "The whole rest of the family seems like they are united in their disregard for Miranda and Maggie. They don\u2019t care enough about them to put forth anything more than a cursory attempt at politeness so I think this is actually going to silence Maggie which will make everyone much happier.", "Exactly, the Dad should be upset with both for behaving like children.", "I had to scroll too far down to see this. OP, your comment was unnecessary and cruel. Your Father is right and she wasn't complaining about you, but the people who didn't bother to come to her wedding. You sound like a very spoiled bride.  Word of advice, be generous while getting married, it's hard when you have \"veil vision\" but in the long run it is much better.  You tearing her down, made you as self-absorbed sounding as she did, ESH.", "And for what? Cause she wasn\u2019t even shit talking the wedding she was shit talking the family.", "I'm surprised it took this long to find a YTA.

She thinks everyone is unfavourably judging her all the time, to the point where she regularly gets upset about random people looking at her \"judgmentally\" as they pass in the street. So, when my dad's family didn't immediately fawn over and treat her like the Second Coming, she decided they obviously despise her and think she's trash. She decided it wasn't a \"good environment\" and skipped everything she reasonably could.

When the entire extended family RSVPs no, that\u2019s not a scheduling conflict, that\u2019s a statement of what they think about you.  And if Miranda is as awful as OP has made her out to be, she probably wasn\u2019t a very good mother to Maggie growing up, and certainly wasn\u2019t attending to Maggie\u2019s emotional needs.  So who did Maggie have after all that?  What was her family?\n\nAnd as that all was going on, she got to watch OP, just a few years younger, have the opposite experience.  To get to have both her parents alive (even if divorced).  Who was embraced and loved by the extended family that had rejected Maggie.  Can you imagine how painful that probably was to her as a teen/tween?  Of course she\u2019s sad and angry and probably doesn\u2019t know what yo do with it because she probably doesn\u2019t feel safe taking it to the real sources of her anger in case they reject her again/as well.\n\nMaggie\u2019s behavior is not okay.
