The family that Miranda removed herself and Maggie from that you are a part of will all be there for your wedding and Maggie can\u2019t handle it. Maggie is living the result of Miranda\u2019s choices and you shouldn\u2019t constantly have to feel like it\u2019s your fault every time you have to be around them.

Was your statement diplomatic? No. You absolutely could have phrased that better. But in the post and your comments it\u2019s clear that Miranda never tried to cultivate a relationship with your dad\u2019s family, and kept Maggie away from them too, perhaps even encouraging her to develop a negative view of the family. \n\nSo the real question is why Maggie would even expect people who she has an extremely limited relationship with to go out of their way to attend her wedding? Why would she be given heirloom jewellery when Miranda has made it clear Maggie isn\u2019t part of their family?  Their expectations were unrealistic in the first place.", "As much as you took it too far, NTA.\n\nWhen you do nothing but keep comparing stuff and creating unnecessary statements that are so passive-aggressive, anyone would be pissed off here.\n\nApologizing is highly encouraged, although it requires a lot of swallowing pride.

Do you get one for that? Are you not entitled to an apology for being for being torn apart for something YOU are not involved in at all?\n\nAsk him WHY you don't get an apology for her bringing you into bs drama?\n\nMaggie took it too far and you put an **END** to it.

That if she is not happy with her lifestyle that is entirely on her and HER CHOICES.  \n\nIf Miranda continues to give him a hard time then he needs to handle his own wife and leave you out of it.

I had 5 step siblings that, like you, I never really lived with and while we got on ok, they would never have expected my father\u2019s family to show up to their family events. My dad went as their mum\u2019s husband, but no one else. \n\nThey were also significantly wealthier than us (my mother and my siblings), both because their mother\u2019s family had money and because my dad was wealthier by the time he and his second wife got together. We got some perks from that (my dad was generous later in life), but I had a small wedding at home while my step siblings had six-figure weddings at country clubs, resorts and one at the NY Public Library.  That\u2019s just how it is. Some families have more $ than others.\n\nThat being said, you\u2019re still an AH. Not THE AH, because she was an AH first, but definitely an AH. You should apologize, not to keep the peace but because it was an unkind thing to say. Tell her what you told us. That it\u2019s hurtful that she\u2019s using your wedding as a way to air her grievances (especially that crack about how she should have married your fianc\u00e9 which is disrespectful not only to you, but also her own husband. Seriously big yuck on that comment). Then let it go. If she won\u2019t, then drop her with no remorse.", "NTa. People didn't care about her wedding. It's the truth.

She didn't attack you personally, but the same cannot be said for you when it came to attacking her.\n\nI would have just said something like, \"Maggie, give it a rest. You've been ranting about this nonstop. It's getting boring.\"\n\nThat said, this part really struck me as a particularly awful thing for Maggie to say.\n\n>She has gone so far as to say that she should have married my fianc\u00e9 since she\u2019s closer in age to him and they \u201cskipped\u201d her (she believes my marriage was arranged).\n\nDid she ever say this in front of her husband? Is this to say she would prefer your fianc\u00e9 to her own husband?\n\nIf I were her husband, I'd be very concerned about this.\n\nETA: Some of the other stuff that she complains about, I think are unwarranted. But I'd like some INFO: Why should her stepfather offer to pay for her wedding? Where is her father? Are her parents divorced or is he deceased?\n\nAs for the heirloom jewelry, I think she's being ridiculous about that. I assume this jewelry came from your parents' family. Why should she be offered heirloom jewelry from a family that isn't hers? As for the extended family that chose not to attend her wedding, would that be the same extended family that she intentionally chose to distance herself from?\n\nI get that this can be frustrating for stepchildren, especially since there's an obvious income disparity operating here. But on the other hand, Miranda and Maggie intentionally chose to not to connect with your family. And maybe it is difficult for them, but I assume that Miranda did not marry into this family ignorant of what she was getting into.", "YTA. She has obvious issues with not feeling important in the family and your response it to tell her in front of everyone no one cares about her. \nShame on you. You could gave handled this a million different ways and this is the way you chose.", "ESH, just apologize and move on. You didn\u2019t specify the \u201cchip\u201d they hold about the dads side of the family, but he\u2019s still a father figure for her too. She\u2019s hurt and displaying it incorrectly, and your comment went too far. It\u2019s always possibly to ask someone to move on kindly, and have a conversation privately.", "ESH - whilst I understand your frustration you were incredibly mean to your stepsister who is clearly feeling vulnerable about her place in your fathers family. You didn\u2019t say how long your dad and his wife been married but sounds like been a while so you can understand why she might be upset about the lack of attendance. A simple \u2018can we stop comparing weddings it isn\u2019t a competition\u2019 would have sufficed. Saying no one cares is rude and incredibly mean. I do think you owe her an apology for that.\n\nThat said your stepsister is also spectacularly obnoxious in all her other complaints. And the finance comment was outrageous, your dad needs to have a word with his wife and put a stop to all that. Should be made clear to your stepsister that this wedding is not about her and if she can\u2019t just be happy for you then might be best she doesn\u2019t attend.", "ESH yuck.", " kinda TA because that was not the way to address it lol \nAlthough she sounds super salty about the past and didnt have to be so passive aggressive . If she wanted to talk she couldve instead of dropping comments like that. Apologise to keep the peace but in all wouldnt give her the time of day. She seems insecure and perhaps other lingering emotions that she needs to confront.", "YTA. Listen to your dad. What you did was inappropriate and unnecessarily mean.", "Esh for being awful humans", "I almost want to say that everyone's the asshole in this situation. I might not word this the best so forgive me for that but, but her behaviour what was she expected to have happened, eventually acting that way in front of people is eventually going to rile someone up to the point that someone does exactly what you did or people start going no contact with people who behave in such a manner because they just can't seem to better themselves. So in a way I want to say you're a justified asshole in the situation given her behaviour. Ultimately it would have been nice if Maggie came to you and privately talked to you about all her concerns in an emotionally mature way but I simply don't believe the woman is currently capable of providing that currently to anyone given her behaviour. I would say it might be wise to apologize but at the same time given what I've read here I don't believe an apology will lead you to a place where her actions won't repeat again. I think over all she really needs to be emotionally vulnerable with you so you both understand each other to move forward but that might genuinely be expecting too much out of Maggie given her clear lack of emotional maturity especially for her age. But hey you know her better than I do and if you believe you can have a heart to heart with her and truly make amends then do it otherwise I'd say it might be wise to go no contact from here on out since she cannot respect you in any way shape or form.", "YTA.  You just had to rub it in Maggie\u2019s face that she\u2019s a second-class citizen in the family; didn\u2019t you.", "Edit to ESH based on OPs response. Maggie came into this family at 12 - not super young but still a child. It\u2019s obvious she has resentment of not feeling welcome into the family and you seem either completely oblivious or part of that OP. Dads aren\u2019t obligated to pay for their daughter\u2019s weddings but the fact that your Dad is the type to offer and didn\u2019t offer to contribute at all to the woman whose life he has been in since she was 12 is pretty hurtful; it makes we wonder what it was like for Maggie to live with him. That said Maggie is now a grown married lady, she needs to get therapy if she needs it and move on with her life. She shouldn\u2019t be bringing up bitterness from her own wedding every time you mention yours but you OP could also learn a little grace and understanding. I do think you owe her an apology for your out of line blowup. \n\nInfo: \n\nHow long have your Dad and Miranda been married? What\u2019s the deal with the extended family? These answers make the difference between ESH and YTA.", "ESH.\n\nMaggie has a whole bunch of issues. She's bitter about how the family has treated her. Whether her bitterness is justified is not for me to judge, but it is inappropriate for her to hijack a dinner party to air her grievances.\n\nHowever, you know what she's like. You knew there was a good chance she will cause some kind of scene. There are other ways you could have handled it. You could have said \"Maggie, I realize you're still upset, but now isn't the time or place. We're trying to have a pleasant evening here. Let's talk about this another time.\" Or you could have decided not to attend this dinner at all, knowing she would be there. Instead, you attended, you let her get under your skin, and you retaliated by being gratuitously mean.\n\nI understand the impulse to be mean. I have a sister who has been a pain in the ass for more than 50 years. She has created a scene similar to Maggie's at just about every family get-together we've ever had. Often she has to leave these functions early, because she works a job where she has to wake up at 4:30am, so she can't do late nights. After she walks out the door and gets in her car, everyone cheers. Literally cheers. They all find her as irritating as I do, but none of them are prepared to say so to her face. I used to say so, decades ago, but then I realized I was behaving as badly as she was. She got under my skin, so I retaliated. I tried to tell myself my nastiness was justified because she started it, but the fact was, I didn't like the person I was becoming when I was around her.\n\nSo how do I deal with her now? I go to as few family functions as possible where I know she is invited. I still see my other family members; I just get together with them in smaller, separate groups that don't include my sister. Sometimes my attendance is unavoidable (e.g. Christmas, or a wedding), but on these occasions the gathering is large enough that I can position myself as far away as possible from her, and there are usually plenty of people in between. In that way, I can nearly always avoid exchanging more than a dozen words with her. If she starts creating a scene, I leave the room.\n\nYou can find a way of dealing with Maggie if you need to, even if that way is by avoiding her. Don't let her bad behavior become an excuse for your own.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like Maggie and Miranda have been bringing up their feelings about your Dad's family for awhile now. You spent a good chunk of time escaping to your Dad's family.

She and her mom always distsnced themselves from the family, why did she wanted them at the wedding in the first place?", "I guess they don't because OP didn't mention anyone standing up for her. How sad.", "Actually, she's been rubbing it in everyone's faces since the day I got engaged.", "They've been married for 12 years, together 15.\n\nWhat do you mean by \"deal\", and which extended family are you referring to? If you mean the ones who didn't attend Maggie's wedding and you're asking why, we're not especially close to them, see them maybe three times a year, they all live in different parts of the world...not sure what else to add?", "OP behaviour was extremely bad as well especially what she said. I have no issues with her saying something to her but it\u2019s how she said it it was cruel and downright mean. No excuse for it and it makes her TA.", "Most likely because step sister and mum never wanted to attend events with Op's father side of the family. If they never cared about them, why should they care about her wedding?", "Maybe she wanted her husband only to focus on her and her kid, instead of him spending time with his family. Maybe she tried to cause a rift in op's relationship with her dad, and the family didn't stood for it. \n\n>now is actively participating in perpetuating it.\n\nBy ... having her family at a wedding and wearing family jewels??", "Okay, let\u2019s roll with what you said. That, that\u2019s how it played out. Tell me how that is OPs fault when she was a child when it started and then Miranda removed herself from the situation so OP didn\u2019t even interact with them? Tell me how OP should be blamed for any of it bc even if we go with your way of how it played out it still isn\u2019t OPs fault, it\u2019s her dads. He was TA who let his new family get treated that way. He is the one who let the division happen (I mean either way he is guilty of this one). He was the one who didn\u2019t offer for Maggie\u2019s wedding, that\u2019s on him. So all OP is really guilty of is feeling some strong emotions in a moment of yet again being attacked by Maggie for something that either her step mom or bio dad caused and finally saying something to put Maggie in her place", "I think this is a difficult situation to properly judge.\n\nIt sounds to me as though this bad blood happened when both you and Maggie were young (since you mention in your OP that you 'grew up' pretty much apart from her and your step-mother, and spent a lot of time with your dad's family), so I'm going to be bold and assume that both of you have probably only ever heard one side of this story - one that makes the 'other side' look bad - and the result is that you both don't have very good things to say about each other. \n\nAs to the issue at hand: It is wrong of Maggie to keep on about your dad's extended family not attending her wedding (like, what was she expecting since her mother went nuclear on them) and comparing it to yours, as well as all the other crap she has said, so she's definitely the bigger AH in this situation. However, you could have told her to stop whining without being cruel about it. Telling her that nobody cared and never will care about her wedding was too much and untrue, since I'm certain that there were people at her wedding who clearly *do* care about her. \n\nI can really only conclude that ESH, but with the caveat that this is probably a far more complicated situation than it appears.", "Kind of like how you\u2019re unfavorably judging her?", "Yeah, that\u2019s just weird to me. I would never expect people to treat me the same way they treat their blood relatives even though our parents happened to get married. I still think \u201cno one cares\u201d is harsh, but I just don\u2019t understand where her anger is coming from.", "In light of this. I'm going to change my vote.", "She\u2019s been rubbing it in people\u2019s faces that she\u2019s a second-class citizen in the family?  That doesn\u2019t even make sense.", "YTA and your comments are making it worse. She\u2019s hurting about alot more than the wedding. The wedding is just the most blatant example of her being disregarded. \n\nA small amount of kindness in your heart would make all the difference to her right now. \n\nYou owe her an apology.", "Maggie is another man\u2019s daughter. That\u2019s like expecting Miranda to offer her heirloom jewelry to OP. OP has her own mother. Meggie has her own father, presumably.", "I wouldn't consider it \"bad blood\" per se. I've only ever heard about why Miranda stopped coming to things from my dad, and he told me not to bring it up to the rest of the family so I don't think they know/care. \n\nPrior to this issue I didn't have anything to say about Maggie at all and I presume she didn't about me, either. I might have been wrong on that score.\n\nBut yeah, people are complicated haha.", "I dont know. I felt when Step sis started saying the hisband should have been hers it crossed a major line.....", "It's not a judgement, she really is like that. I'm not saying it makes her a bad person.", "She has been eagerly and constantly been drawing attention to the fact that that is her interpretation. At no point has she attempted to have an open conversation with anyone about her feelings. In fact, she didn't say a word about any of this until I got engaged. Then suddenly every time we see her she brings up my wedding just to compare it to hers. That's what I mean.", "No, maggie owes everyone an apology. Especially op for harping about how her wedding is this and that. Is not op's fault that people don't like maggie and didn't want to go to her wedding.", "So basically your step-sister decides to dislike people first before they get the chance to dislike her. Then when she decides she wants to be apart of their lives she thinks she can just act like it all never happened? I can see how that\u2019d make someone not want to attend a wedding.", "And you couldn\u2019t resist putting her in her place.  You wanted her to feel lesser, and now you want reassurance that it doesn\u2019t make you look like a mean, self-centered brat.  I\u2019m not going yo give you that absolution.\n\nAnd deep down, you know it was a shitty thing to say or you wouldn\u2019t be questioning whether YTA.", "So OP should let maggie insult her and be quiet about it?? Maggie is the one acting like a self centered brat because some people she's not related to didn't give her jewelry for her wedding.", "I mean questioning whether YTA sure as shit doesn't mean they're the asshole... otherwise every post would result in a YTA rating.", "This!", "Which is why it\u2019s a bit odd when people come in to ask if they are TA and argue vehemently with people who suggest they might be."]}
