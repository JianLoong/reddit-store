Time to put your phone on do not disturb at night. \"Cool uncle\" needs AA not rides.", "Funny that the siblings that turned out better didnt get called first eh?\n\nDrinking to the point you can't drive, and then calling your nephew sounds like an alcoholic. Don't enable him. And tell whichever adult is responsible for him that he's doing this bullshit \n\nNTA", "NTA. If he doesn\u2019t decide to organise a way home for himself from the bar, it\u2019s not your responsibility to be at his beck and call. To be honest it sounds like your uncle may have a serious alcohol problem if he is starting to turn on his family and say those horrible things to you for not enabling his night of drinking. \n\nAlso, both your roommates are AHs too. Saying that it would somehow be your fault if your uncle made a terrible decision to drive a car drunk is just ridiculous. If he done that, you would absolutely not be the cause of that.", "NTA. This is what uber, lyft and local taxi companies are for.\n\nIf you called him at 6am and demanded a favour (not necessarily driving) how likely is he to think that is reasonable?", "NTA. it's not your responsibility to sponsor his binges or prevent him from making mistakes, even ones that could cost someone else their life. He can and should get an uber. What he said to you was horrible and so out of line and undeserved. You always have the right to say no, and from now on, i suggest you make use of it.", "NTA.\n\nWell, he should have called a cab or uber, or maybe even consider public transport. If you have the money to get drunk in a bar, you also should have the money, to let you drive home. Also it's rude to call anyone at 2am. If it's a one time thing, he could have asked in advance, but not every night.   \n\n\nAlso it would have been his decision, if he drove home under the influence.", "While I think you could have done it once since you are close, his response to you declining is reprehensible, so I will say NTA. While inconvenient, I think it\u2019s ok for him to ask if his other mode of transportation fell through (as long as it doesn\u2019t happen every night), but he should have accepted your answer. Was he unable to get an Uber or a taxi or something or just too cheap to do it? \n\nHave you talked to some specialist about your depression btw.?", "NTA. Drunk uncle needs to plan better, and he absolutely needs to be more responsible. I\u2019m not a fan of the \u2018but he\u2019s FAMILY\u2019 argument when talking about non-dependents (obviously parents have responsibilities to their underage kids and at times to adult offspring with disabilities that prevent them from living independently). If an adult is making crappy choices and trying to insist I help them deal with the consequences of those choices, I feel no more or less obliged to help based on their DNA.", "NTA. You\u2019re not responsible for chauffeuring your uncle around at the wee hours of the morning, depressed or not. Your uncle is old enough that he can find his own way home like everybody else when they\u2019re drunk.", "Dude is 46 and should know his limits.\n\nNTA.
