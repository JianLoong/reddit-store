I\u2019ve known his wife Chrissy since college and during their wedding I met Becca who was the maid of honor (28F). Really cool person, she has a 6 year old who she brings to Trenton/Chrissy\u2019s when I\u2019m there so I\u2019ve gotten to know Becca well. \n\nRecently I broke up with my GF and I was hanging out more at Trenton\u2019s because Chrissy is pregnant (with permission). Chrissy suggested that since I don\u2019t have anyone to do things with right now that I should get closer to Becca because she likes to try new places too. Becca is fun, easy on the eyes and would provide great company. We made plans to check out a new brewery and I was clear that it was as friends.\n\nWe texted back and forth a few times during the week leading up. Saturday comes and 2 hours before she calls franticly saying her kid was having a meltdown because of her dads parents and was sick so she had to cancel. I told her it was all good. The next week we didn\u2019t talk as much and Chrissy asked if I was gonna give the friendship another go. I said maybe. \n\nOn Monday, Becca called me apologizing and asked if I wanted to check out the brewery Friday. I said absolutely. Literally 1 hour before she calls me almost in tears. Saying babysitter canceled and asked if I\u2019d be okay waiting for another hour. She was going to take her kid to her parents who lived 30 minutes away and then would meet me. I told her I wasn\u2019t gonna wait around another hour because the whole point of this was to have friends to do things with. I had been bailed on twice, so I was gonna go. \n\nShe offered to have me come to her place and she\u2019d make us a drink on the back deck and we could hangout there for the night till her kid went to bed. I said that wasn\u2019t the kind of friendship I was wanting and it just felt like our schedules were not aligning. I wanted a friend who I could do things with consistently. My time is valuable and two weekends in a row I made plans that feel through. I said maybe there was too much baggage here. She apologized and said she wanted to make it up to me. I said there was no reason to do that. We could just be casual friends like before. But if she ever wanted to hangout late night when she has more time then she had my number. That was the end of it. Well starting on Monday Chrissy has been pissed at me. I stopped at their place last night she had comments for me. I told her my side and she said I knew Becca had kids and that things would pop up. I said I knew they would, but I don\u2019t my time being wasted. While Becca was cute her lifestyle is not something I\u2019m into. So we could go back to the way things were. Chrissy kept going at me in a way I\u2019ve never seen before. Me and Trenton gamed last night and he said she\u2019s still mad. But thinks it might just be pregnancy hormones.

You explicitly stated the sort of thing you were looking for wasn\u2019t going to happen but you could still be casual FRIENDS. And go back to the way things were BEFORE. You said she had your number and could call later at night while she had free time, but you weren\u2019t going to keep trying to make plans that were going to fall through every time, as they have the past two times you tried to do so. Idk, just seems a bit ridiculous to me.", "Overall, NTA. She\u2019s not in a place where she can hang out the way you want to.

You're too busy to wait an hour to hang out with someone who's having kid problems, but you'e also not so busy that you admittedly have no friends. Also, blowing her off then asking her to call you late night was pretty shitty. What if she calls and then needs a half hour? I can't imagine the post you'd put on reddit about her wasting your time.", "NAH and this comment section is weird af. You are allowed to not date someone if your priorities clearly dont match up, and she is the one who brought up the idea of a late night hang out.

Also, Chrissy is not respecting that Becca can handle her life; no need to rescue something that is not drowning.\n\nLet's talk booty call: Several posts assume this goal was in play and voted Y - - while painting OP as awful and ignoring Becca went in the booty call direction first (intentionally or not). (Becca asked him to her house for drinks on the patio until her kid went to bed.) \n\nThis sub vibe often perpetuates helpless female fallacies by assigning a 'Y' vote toward the male when a female does the same action (N- - vote).

If she fully canceled the plans or something for a second time sure that is more understandable imo but not for being a bit late. But to be honest if being a bit late is so much a problem I can kind of see why you dont have many friends to explore new things with. \n\nAnd the second thing is the whole \"But if she ever wanted to hangout late night when she has more time then she had my number.\" whilst can sound innocent.

I dunno.\n\nIt's clear you are a selfish dude and was right to be honest about that to Becca.

Not knowing her, I don't never know if putting herself in a friends-with-benefits situation would work well for her.\n\nThe only criticism I would give Becca was to just be more upfront with you about HER needs and wants.

For example, crime generally occurs at a higher rate in impoverished areas. So, an informed bias would lead one to take precautions, e.g., favor lit, well-traveled streets. However, it's prejudiced to not hire someone who is poor because you assume they will steal.\n\nPropogating the highlighted passage spreads a bias and then features it as a personality trait on which a person can reasonably act. There was little in the way of hedging language. In this case, a prejudice can be infered but it isn't reasonable to assume one holding the bias is prejudiced as a matter of fact.\n\nPeople do hold the stated belief and data supports the real-world application. According to census data, a married person makes more than their single counterparts.  Further analysis has stratified and shown it applies for people of similar education and experience.  \n\n> Context is also important\n\nYour response is reasonable and makes some good points.
