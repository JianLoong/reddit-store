I\u2019ve known his wife Chrissy since college and during their wedding I met Becca who was the maid of honor (28F). Really cool person, she has a 6 year old who she brings to Trenton/Chrissy\u2019s when I\u2019m there so I\u2019ve gotten to know Becca well. \n\nRecently I broke up with my GF and I was hanging out more at Trenton\u2019s because Chrissy is pregnant (with permission). Chrissy suggested that since I don\u2019t have anyone to do things with right now that I should get closer to Becca because she likes to try new places too. Becca is fun, easy on the eyes and would provide great company. We made plans to check out a new brewery and I was clear that it was as friends.\n\nWe texted back and forth a few times during the week leading up. Saturday comes and 2 hours before she calls franticly saying her kid was having a meltdown because of her dads parents and was sick so she had to cancel. I told her it was all good. The next week we didn\u2019t talk as much and Chrissy asked if I was gonna give the friendship another go. I said maybe. \n\nOn Monday, Becca called me apologizing and asked if I wanted to check out the brewery Friday. I said absolutely. Literally 1 hour before she calls me almost in tears. Saying babysitter canceled and asked if I\u2019d be okay waiting for another hour. She was going to take her kid to her parents who lived 30 minutes away and then would meet me. I told her I wasn\u2019t gonna wait around another hour because the whole point of this was to have friends to do things with. I had been bailed on twice, so I was gonna go. \n\nShe offered to have me come to her place and she\u2019d make us a drink on the back deck and we could hangout there for the night till her kid went to bed. I said that wasn\u2019t the kind of friendship I was wanting and it just felt like our schedules were not aligning. I wanted a friend who I could do things with consistently. My time is valuable and two weekends in a row I made plans that feel through. I said maybe there was too much baggage here. She apologized and said she wanted to make it up to me. I said there was no reason to do that. We could just be casual friends like before. But if she ever wanted to hangout late night when she has more time then she had my number. That was the end of it. Well starting on Monday Chrissy has been pissed at me. I stopped at their place last night she had comments for me. I told her my side and she said I knew Becca had kids and that things would pop up. I said I knew they would, but I don\u2019t my time being wasted. While Becca was cute her lifestyle is not something I\u2019m into. So we could go back to the way things were. Chrissy kept going at me in a way I\u2019ve never seen before. Me and Trenton gamed last night and he said she\u2019s still mad. But thinks it might just be pregnancy hormones.

You\u2019re going to get decimated on here though.

Your title indicates a \"douchey\" text, but in your story this all happened in a phone call. What's the text?", "NTA - You're not an asshole for knowing what you want and don't want. Chrissy was trying to set you and  Becca up, under the disguise of having a \"friend to do things with\", because Becca probably mentioned she liked you. What neither of them thought about was that you're (presumably) childfree and that you aren't trying to get in a relationship with someone who has a child, because that takes time and effort that you aren't willing to put in.", "You are allowed to feel how you want and date who you want but reading this gives off ick vibes.

Becca isnt a long time close friend so i dont think anything is owed.

There\u2019s a lot about how you\u2019ve described your approach that I personally find much too Type A for what I can be arsed with but it doesn\u2019t make you an AH.

YTA for how you talked to her. You don't have to want to be friends, more than friends, into her lifestyle, etc. You could at least be polite and keep it to yourself that her emergencies with her kid are a waste of time and indication of baggage in your eyes. \n\nPS: She didn't bail on you the second time, she was running late. *You* bailed.", "Way to bury the real reason YTA.     You basically sent her a text that said \u201cI\u2019m not gonna put any effort in, but if you wanna bang, hit me up.\u201d    And yes, that\u2019s gross.     I was going with a n t an until that point.", "NTA for respecting yourself and your own time, you owe nothing to her or Chrissy. But it does sound like Chrissy was trying to set you up and Becca was probably into you. It\u2019s hard having kids and replying in babysitters all the time, so you may want to consider that your expectations for her are a bit high. Only an hour delay the second time is not really that bad. So you\u2019re definitely not an asshole but you probably could\u2019ve been nicer about it.", "NTA. As a single mom, I also value my time and would be upset if someone cancelled multiple times in a row. Being single and childless doesn\u2019t make your time any less valuable. \n\nMy friendships/relationships are heavily based around people that are cool with me being a single mom, and I\u2019m not mad at those who aren\u2019t interested in that friendship or relationship wise. \n\nIt sounds like they were trying to set you up and are upset that it\u2019s not a dynamic you\u2019re interested.

Life happens and she appeared to be genuinely remorseful. YTA for responding to the situation with a text message suggesting that she would only be good to you as a booty-call. So crass and so, so stupid.", "I meant that I had permission to be over at their place more given they are having a kid lol", "Becca made the first move for him to go to her home and drink. Why is there a fixation on OP dropping a booty call invite and Becca was not? Lets not tip the scale toward OP is an awful person.", "he wanted a platonic friendship?", "But were they attempting to date or just be friends? I'm confused by OP's story and what his motivations were.", "I started texting her during the second meeting right after she asked me to wait another hour. Sorry should have been clearer on that.", "Don't forget \"but if you want to hang out late at night, you have my number\"\n\nBasically, she's got too much baggage for OP to waste his valuable time on, but she's good enough for a late night booty call (but just barely).", "Is luggage preferable? Perhaps dunnage? Paraphenalia?", "I had to read that sentence a bunch of times, but I think he meant he was at their place hanging out and gaming with permission. The use and placement of parentheses are confusing in the first few paragraphs.", "He told Becca that if she ever wanted to hang out late at night he's down.

But she had my number.", "If he just wanted to bang, wouldn\u2019t he have taken her up on the offer of hanging out at her place? It feels like that was the intent.

Yes she had reasons, but that would be a pretty big indication that dating a single parent won\u2019t work for him. So he\u2019s acknowledging that dating isn\u2019t going to work, but never said he wasn\u2019t attracted to her, and so laid another option on the table.", "A platonic friendship, except she has \"too much baggage\" and isn't worth his \"valuable time\"....unless she wants to \"call him late at night\". \n\n\nYeah, OP made it clear that the only thing she's worth to him is a late night bang.", "What did he mean by this?\n\n>But if she ever wanted to hangout late night when she has more time then she had my number.\n\nThe implication here seems to be \"booty call\", unless OP can clarify.", "This is a stretch and it's not necessary. Why is OP being degraded on how he communicated and yet the same evaluation of Becca's offer is not? \n\nBecca asked him to her house for drinks on the patio until her kid went to bed. --- Was Becca wanting a booty call? .", "Yes, except for those. I see your point but she had legitimate reasons. It's obnoxious to blow her off but add the suggestion that he'd be up for just a fuck.", "It might not be what you intended (is it?) but it\u2019s definitely what I understood from your message.\n\nIf you genuinely just meant she should message you when the kids are definitely asleep so that plans won\u2019t be broken, you need to circle back and just explain the mix up", "\"Late at night\"? \n\n\nYou basically said she wasn't worth more than a booth call. Either be PLATONIC friends or date, but you just came off as a skeeze", ">I don\u2019t think that is what I said\u2026\n\nValid but I think you should consider it might have been taken that way because people sure do say things like that to single moms and they mean exactly what is being suggested.", "You also said is she ever wants to hang out late at night - you're all in?", "To be honest, it read to me like that\u2019s exactly what Becca was suggesting", "This! She set that up first.\n\nAnd he tried to date her. She flaked. I don\u2019t get why it\u2019s unreasonable to say well we\u2019re not going to work as a couple, but you\u2019re hot so we can have fun. Maybe I\u2019m too gay for this."]}
