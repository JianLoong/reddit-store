I\u2019ve known his wife Chrissy since college and during their wedding I met Becca who was the maid of honor (28F). Really cool person, she has a 6 year old who she brings to Trenton/Chrissy\u2019s when I\u2019m there so I\u2019ve gotten to know Becca well. \n\nRecently I broke up with my GF and I was hanging out more at Trenton\u2019s because Chrissy is pregnant (with permission). Chrissy suggested that since I don\u2019t have anyone to do things with right now that I should get closer to Becca because she likes to try new places too. Becca is fun, easy on the eyes and would provide great company. We made plans to check out a new brewery and I was clear that it was as friends.\n\nWe texted back and forth a few times during the week leading up. Saturday comes and 2 hours before she calls franticly saying her kid was having a meltdown because of her dads parents and was sick so she had to cancel. I told her it was all good. The next week we didn\u2019t talk as much and Chrissy asked if I was gonna give the friendship another go. I said maybe. \n\nOn Monday, Becca called me apologizing and asked if I wanted to check out the brewery Friday. I said absolutely. Literally 1 hour before she calls me almost in tears. Saying babysitter canceled and asked if I\u2019d be okay waiting for another hour. She was going to take her kid to her parents who lived 30 minutes away and then would meet me. I told her I wasn\u2019t gonna wait around another hour because the whole point of this was to have friends to do things with. I had been bailed on twice, so I was gonna go. \n\nShe offered to have me come to her place and she\u2019d make us a drink on the back deck and we could hangout there for the night till her kid went to bed. I said that wasn\u2019t the kind of friendship I was wanting and it just felt like our schedules were not aligning. I wanted a friend who I could do things with consistently. My time is valuable and two weekends in a row I made plans that feel through. I said maybe there was too much baggage here. She apologized and said she wanted to make it up to me. I said there was no reason to do that. We could just be casual friends like before. But if she ever wanted to hangout late night when she has more time then she had my number. That was the end of it. Well starting on Monday Chrissy has been pissed at me. I stopped at their place last night she had comments for me. I told her my side and she said I knew Becca had kids and that things would pop up. I said I knew they would, but I don\u2019t my time being wasted. While Becca was cute her lifestyle is not something I\u2019m into. So we could go back to the way things were. Chrissy kept going at me in a way I\u2019ve never seen before. Me and Trenton gamed last night and he said she\u2019s still mad. But thinks it might just be pregnancy hormones.

You said she had your number and could call later at night while she had free time, but you weren\u2019t going to keep trying to make plans that were going to fall through every time, as they have the past two times you tried to do so.

Also, blowing her off then asking her to call you late night was pretty shitty. What if she calls and then needs a half hour? I can't imagine the post you'd put on reddit about her wasting your time.", "NAH and this comment section is weird af.

But to be honest if being a bit late is so much a problem I can kind of see why you dont have many friends to explore new things with. \n\nAnd the second thing is the whole \"But if she ever wanted to hangout late night when she has more time then she had my number.\" whilst can sound innocent.

Or her invitation to hang out with her and her kid?", "So why does the OP saying you have my number automatically mean sex?", "Friendship is still a relationship\u2026", "To me it sounds like Becca dodged a potential bullet. Bc you know by the way he sounds entitled he\u2019d probably shift to wanting to bang and so on. The fact that he\u2019s not understanding of the fact that her CHILD comes first is a major red flag. This man\u2019s vibes has me more nervous than a porcupine in a room full of balloons.", "Yeah, you\u2019re making a lot of sense here. Its just an hour, and its not like he did anything else that night. He could have even told her he would go ahead and she could join up when she was ready, since he was going alone anyway\n\nYeah it seems there was some hurt feelings/resentment in how he chose to handle that, which is a ridiculous emotion to have towards a single mother in a situation like this", "Yeah that part was weird. I don't understand why he wouldn't wait an hr. Everyone values time, but she was putting in effort to make up for it and make the plan still happen. My only guess is he thinks based on experience seeing her irl at his mates. That she's lying.", "I remember when I had plans to hang out with this cute girl from work almost 10 years ago.  Fell through (she cancelled).  Tried again, this time I had to cancel.  I really wanted to get to know her, but wound up leaving to go travel quite some distance for a one-month seasonal job.  That was one of the most brutal months of my life for a number of reasons, so when I got back I made sure to make plans with this gal as soon as possible\u2026 we got married a couple years later, and even though she wasn\u2019t perfect she is by far the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me.", "So you didn't mean \"booty call?\" \n\nJust checking", "Direct question:\n\n**What does it mean when you say you don't want to sit indoors and do nothing and have to be quiet but in another section of your post you offer to her you can hang out late night when she has time at her place where you have to sit indoors and be quiet because a kid is sleeping?**\n\nWhat are you able to do at her place late at night that you can't do in the daytime? I can understand if you're saying you don't want to burn daylight at someone's house when you want to go out, as most places have business hours, so what activities did you plan to do at her house in the late hours of the night? I don't care what your intentions were, you repeatedly invoke 3 things multiple times in this post:\n- her looks\n- her kid/ baggage\n- wanting a specific type of friendship\n\nYou're treating her like a booty call and you know you low key implied it. Sorry sir, no one here believes the two of you are just going to meet up platonically 12 midnight for crackers and tea to discuss taxes and the weather. Most people I know that are meeting up that late are either good friends with an established platonic relationship or fucking. Take your carefully crafted and diplomatic language out of here because it doesn't matter how nicely you articulate, you're trying to feed us 2+2=10 when we see the reality of what's transpiring here", "No one is arguing with your lack of desire to date this woman.  The problem is you referenced in your post that you made it clear you were only looking for friendship and then asked reddit whether your friend was justified in being angry with you for sending a super douchey text suggesting she would only be good for late-night hangouts (ie a booty call, for anyone with a brain). The answer is yes. Super douchey.", "Normal people can entertain themselves for an hour.", "So he's supposed to just sit there for an hour and hope she doesn't fully cancel? Na, she had a kid and that's priority. He doesn't need to prioritize someone that already has such a large commitment. That was twice she cancelled/postponed. He doesn't owe her anything, they just don't mesh. That doesn't make him an AH", "I find it so weird that this needs to be said.", "Sounds like he was never trying to date her in the first place though. At most it seemed like he was open to the possibility in the future if they got on well but I don't think he was trying to treat these outings as dates at all right now.  He even clarified that in planning the first outing he'd clearly established this was a 'friends hanging out and doing fun activities together' situation with her.\n\nMy thinking is that the the wife was trying to set up OP and Becca now that OP is single and she probably got Becca's hopes up for this turning into a relationship/dating situation and the wife is now embarrassed and upset that it didn't work out how she had been hoping and is taking that out on OP by acting like he did something wrong.", "I've literally never heard of a person saying to another person in this context \"hey, if you want to hit me up late at night, I'm cool with that\" and have it not mean they were DTF. \n\nI think the matchmaker is equal parts annoyed that it didn't work out AND that OP was, at best, not very thoughtful in his phrasing when it came to speaking to the matchmakers very close friend.", "I don\u2019t know which part of my comment you are replying to.

He even states he made sure she knew that. \n\nSo, his response was basically \u201chey, you\u2019ve got too much baggage for me to even want to be your *friend* anymore but if you wanna bang after your kid goes to bed let me know\u201d \n\nHe\u2019s an AH.", "If you absolutely need people to meet you at a brewery at an exact time instead of just rolling with an adjustment, that's sad.

Sad! Still doesn't make her \"flaky\".", "That's weird, it's just an hour and she gave him notice so it's not like he'd have to wait for her at the brewery. If it were me I'd just take the extra time to tidy up or put on more makeup or make a playlist, there's never nothing to do. And then you still get to go out and hang, no real loss. My friend was late meeting up with me last weekend because of subway delays so I just went into a couple boutiques and looked at clothes until she got there, nbd. I ended up being late to a different friend's house because I couldn't find my keys, I just let them know what was happening.

He wanted a friendship with someone who wanted to go and do things. Given that they\u2019re talking about breweries, it sounds rather like her kid wasn\u2019t in his thinking.

It seems like he was like \u201cdon\u2019t waste my time,\u201d and then proceeded to do nothing lol.\n\nTotally cool being annoyed with multiple cancellations or reschedules, but you also have to understand who you\u2019re dealing with.
