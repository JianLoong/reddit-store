We met at work through her boyfriend introducing us (me and him were friends before me and her were) and were really close from the beginning and I never saw any problems in our friendship. I used to spend the night at her house and vice versa and we would talk daily and facetime all the time. We went everywhere together. We often made jokes with each other, like \u201cyour mom\u201d jokes, \u201cyou suck at this\u201d, \u201cyou\u2019re not very smart\u201d, \u201chow dare you\u201d and things like that. It was mutual, we made the same jokes to each other regularly. But suddenly, she was rarely speaking to me and never answered my calls or texts. I thought she was just busy with work, since she still worked at the place where we met so I tried to bother her as little as possible. Sunday Morning I woke up to see a text message from 3am saying, and i quote :\n\n\u201ci have thought about this for a little bit now and i have decided i don't want to be friends anymore. i feel completely mistreated every-time we talk. the things you say to me are hurtful but it seems you pass them as jokes but i don't take them as jokes, i just feel hurt...that's all i have to say, i'm really sorry.\u201d\n\nI was extremely surprised and genuinely confused about what I had been doing wrong considering we make very similar jokes and nothing she said ever offended me so I assumed it was okay. I often told her  throughout our friendship that if I ever said anything that made her uncomfortable or upset to please let me know and I would apologize and fix my behavior. She never said that anything bothered her and even reassured me that I wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong and I didn\u2019t make her upset with what I said. (I often asked if my jokes were too far just to make sure since she has a previous history of having shitty friends and letting it slide. She also has asperger\u2019s, and things that don\u2019t normally both others can bother her.)\n\nI guess I can understand that sometimes my jokes can seem over the top or possibly rude. But I truly never believed I ever made a joke like that to her, especially since she made similar or even the same jokes. I got a few of my jokes from her, I honestly became her mini me. I often mimic people\u2019s personality and humor to fit with them, so after we had been friends for so long we were practically the same person. everyone said that, even our moms.

Not every person who makes these jokes is an instant bully like the internet jury has deemed you to be for some reason, but I think you're a friend who misread another friend. You're suffering here too, you don't need to be lectured by internet strangers.\n\nYou're a young girl who is hurt that her friend abruptly cut ties with her and instead of seeing you as someone who made an innocent mistake completely unintentionally, you're being spoken to like a bully to that's oblivious to their awful nature, and I don't think that's a fair treatment of you as you don't come off that way at all in your post. You come off to me as a victim of the overcorrection of such jokes. It was a correction that needed doing since bullying was and is a problem, but don't let society or reddit make you feel terrible for who you are, as you said in a comment you grew up around brothers and boys tend to have thicker skin and appreciate darker 'meaner' humor. \n\nThis shouldn't instantly make everyone judge you based on their own mental image of a toxic male and what you must have grown up around solely due to that comment, but unfortunately I've noticed that tends to be the case too often in this community and people will assume what you and your brothers must be like with zero evidence. \n\nI think you made innocent jokes, that in a friend group like mine would probably be mild, but did not work with this friend. Teasing your friends and making them laugh at themselves and laughing at yourself is allowed. If that particular friend of yours isn't comfortable with that humor then she should be free from it, but that doesn't make you an AH for attempting to share your humor with your friend, when you were careful about doing so and even asked her to let you know if you did overstep boundaries.\n\nI do believe your friend was too shy to confront you over it, but that doesn't make you a bad guy and in fact I applaud your self awareness to try and navigate todays sensitive society knowing perhaps your humor was darker than average and attempting to be empathetic to your friend by extending the invitation to let you know if she didn't care for it. The fact that she was too shy to communicate this to you does not make you the AH. You were blindsided by her message and it's unfortunate for both parties involved.\n\nI'm sorry you went through this and I'm sorry the comment section lectured you like you were unforgivable in all if this and not a victim in the situation as well.

I don't think you had any malicious intent.\n\nFor the future, \"mean\" jokes are easy and can be quietly hurtful even in a group where it's okay. I had a friend group like that in my early 20s, it was culturally acceptable and \"funny\" and it hurt. The insults were extravagantly mean and that's how you \"knew they were jokes\". But it still stung.  One guy in the group, the one everyone wanted to hang with, never did that. He made jokes by saying extravagantly kind things. It had the same joke factor but always left people feeling warm. He also always paid attention to who was a bit left out and made sure to talk to them and draw them in. I learnt a lot from him.

So I made an effort to dial back my own teasing, not respond to theirs, and we stayed friends for years.

This situation is a bit shit huh?  NAH.  The key here is that your friend is autistic.  Her brain functions differently than yours, not better, not worse; just different.\nWords hurt.  As jokes they need to go.\nThe autistic brain hears words as meaning just the one thing, the truth. Black and white.  Your friend has been masking (acting neurotypical) with you to fit in, however privately she has been hurt.\nI suggest you do some reading about the autistic brain.  It will help you understand her.\nTry sending her a letter (actual paper) of apology.  Explain that you misread how things were coming across, that you are sorry you hurt her, you miss her and would like to be friends again.\nI hope it works babe.

I also have lost friends from petty situations and things that I said that I didn\u2019t understand were unacceptable, so I tried to make sure she was never upset.

That was my case for so many years. Women are often educated this way.\n\n- they are afraid of conflict\n\n- they are afraid of losing the friendship.\n\nIn short, people lie, all the time.

Thank you.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying, however i just want to explain that she said similar jokes to me as well. that\u2019s why i thought it was okay. but thank you and i will continue to work on this.", "You\u2019re right, I should\u2019ve fixed my humor regardless because I have always had a feeling they weren\u2019t appropriate but she always assured me I wasn\u2019t going overboard so I never bothered. I will work on this, Thank you.", "Whatever it was, i do truly wish she had communicated with words. this is a hard time for me and it will take some time to heal, but while i heal i will improve for future friends so i don\u2019t make the same mistakes. thank you for your feedback.", "I understand, thank you for understanding me and thank you for your feedback.", "We often had conversations where I told her that I truly valued her, and she was the best friend i\u2019ve ever had. I told her that I loved her often and that i related to her more than I have with anyone before. She told me that she cared for me as well and that I was important to her. We also had deep conversations about things we felt and about world topics. It wasn\u2019t always just jokes, we were serious as well. Thank you for your feedback.", "I didn\u2019t belittle her, like i said in my post we made the same jokes. I never took hers as offensive or rude or mean, so I thought it was okay to make the same jokes.. :/ Thank you.", "hm, right. thank you.", "It is possible, however she didn\u2019t really change the way she interacted with me. I changed how I interacted with her, I became different (in a good way) after we became friends and somehow it still went bad. Idk. Thank you.", "Gimme a sample, we talking 4chan level cringe?", "Is she definitely? Or did she say that after you said you were? \n\nI have a feeling she might just be an untrustworthy manipulative person, because it was her behaviour you were mirroring and you checked in a lot before.", "When you would say these things how would they know you don\u2019t truly believe them?", "I hear ya.  I guess it may not seem your mom's jokes are negative, but...", "I think it's mildly TA, bc people should be able to just say \"hey i don't like that\" bc if you're as reasonable as you say you would have modified your behavior right? If not then yes, YTA. The friendship started at a certain status that i wouldn't feel comfortable with, but you both said those things, and if either of you were upset about it, would you have said that? \n\nMaybe you're just young and don't have much experience with assertiveness, but i will say, in my experience, friends enjoy people who lift them up, call them out only when they need it, but will be on their side if they need it. \n\nCalling names and being playfully mean, can be misconstrued. Be nice to your friends :)", "OP, you sound genuinely remorseful, but I seriously doubt your perception on what happened. You don't lose friends because of normal yo mama jokes. Either they were harsher than you thought, or you made more of other types of jokes/insults than you believed. I would find someone who can be honest with you about your behavior.", "that good to hear, and if the people on this post get too much, turn off notifications and hide the post from yourself. You have gotten a lot of feedback but take it all with a grain of salt, your therapist is a better source to help you to sift through all these emotions surrounding the loss of such an important friendship to you than a bunch of faceless accounts on reddit.", "Did she start the jokes, or were they usually in response to yours?", "A lot of people don\u2019t like conflict. Especially against someone with an over the top, brutally honest \u201cjoking\u201d personality. When she laughed it was likely nervous laughter. As others have said, if you had to keep asking, it was time to knock it off.  I do appreciate you taking peoples feedback to heart though instead of justifying.", "No, I typically made your mom jokes or sent her funny tiktok\u2019s  and made jokes like \u201cthis you?\u201d but it wasn\u2019t ever insulting tiktok\u2019s. I also sometimes said \u201cyou suck at this\u201d which she would laugh at so I assumed she found it funny? idk maybe she didn\u2019t.", "she was diagnosed when she was 5, and i was diagnosed when i was 8. at least from what i was told. I will never have anything bad to say about her, because she meant a lot to me. but everything is a possibility so i can\u2019t rule it anything out.", "I usually made it clear it was a joke in fear that she would take it in the wrong way, and she did the same.", "Right. thank you for your feedback.", "I would have for sure fixed my behavior had she communicated that she was upset with my humor and if i was upset i would\u2019ve communicated that. i will improve, thank you.", "When we began our friendship, I noticed she had a great sense of humor and we quickly developed a series of jokes we made to each other. I would make a joke and she would laugh and vice versa or we\u2019d make jokes in response to the others joke. it went both ways.", "You\u2019re right, that is a possibility. Thank you, I learned years ago that I have made mistakes and i cant push the blame off of me just because i\u2019m upset.", "She probably internalized it, or hid her discomfort in an attempt to not seen hurt by your jokes. Meh NTA. I can\u2019t abide by folks that can\u2019t take a joke.", "Okay. But you do say you checked in with her lots and you mirrored her behaviour. I don't think you're to blame here. But for your own health and kindness, maybe don't mirror \"mean\" joking. You can lead the way with kindness instead.", "Thanks for responding - did you say \u201cI am joking\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s just jokes\u201d or \u201cI actually think the opposite\u201d after or just laughed as you said it? And the same for her? How did she let you know it wasn\u2019t actually what she believed about you", "Thank you.", "right. and of course, thank you.", "I typically said \u201ci\u2019m just kidding i love you\u201d or \u201cjk\u201d \u201ci\u2019m just messing with you\u201d and sometimes i did just laugh. for her she just laughed mostly but i knew she was kidding.", "TY so I\u2019m going to refrain from judgement bc not everyone is the same but I wouldn\u2019t do well with that. There\u2019s a lot of heavy crap in the world right now and with my friends the goal is to lift up not tear down. \n\nThere\u2019s very few things that make me think put down jokes have truly no shred of truth. I think for some it can keep you humble others it can wreck them, and again with everything so heavy, I think making folks laugh without negativity or ways to assuage our own anxiety is the way to go. \n\nWishing you peace"]}
