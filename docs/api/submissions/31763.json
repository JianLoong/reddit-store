The first thing I want you to know, is that NOBODY is looking at you, other than a casual glance. They mostly won't even think anything - you are just another nameless body on the beach. If they are looking - so what? Relax - have fun. Little kids don't worry about themselves - because they are unaware, and don't care. Magazines and media make us feel terrible about ourselves.

I\u2019m all down with body positivity and it\u2019s great that she he it, but not everyone shares that. As a friend she should have been way more sympathetic and supportive of your feelings.
