You have the right to be \"too busy\" to see your friend.  You're married with children; he's single.  If anything, it seems like your friendship with him is intruding on other friendships and your family's time with you.  That is not healthy. A compromise might be to include him in some of your family events such as trips to the Zoo, kids' sporting events, and similar.", "INFO why do you have to hang out alone? Does he not like your wife?", "NTA, anyway you can include him when you see other friends or are all your visits one on one. People without family (wife, kids) do not understand just how much time can be taking up with just family stuff let alone, work, other friends, down time.", "NTA. I'm also married in my 30s, and there's no way I'd agree to see anyone who doesn't live in my home once a week. That's too much. I think it's a weird expectation to have unless there was some prior conversation/agreement about it.\n\nIf it were me, I'd just drop the rope. Make the plans you want to make and decline the ones you aren't into or can't make. If your friend wants a makeup day, say, \"Sorry, can't make that work, but I'll see you for coffee next week.\" If this guy gets salty about it...okay? He can go find other friends with more availability, I guess.", "You have a very busy life.  You aren't obligated to squeeze him into your already busy schedule.  Yet friends are generally a welcome relief from the demands ones family requires.   And work is an obligation that actually comes before anyone because without work there's no food on the table nor a roof over their heads.   \n\nDon't let guilt control your decision making.   A friendship is one of devotion, love, compassion, respect and understanding.    An understanding that you can't just drop what you're doing to even have a cup of coffee, nor catch up on the latest of what's going on in your lives.  Appears he needs the time he spends with you.  Your plate is full.   \n\nI've been married fifty years.  We've raised our family.  We have grandchildren.  We have our furry babies.  We have retired.   And now I have plenty of time to spend with my friends.   I remember being pulled in all directions.  I know exactly how you feel.  I too had friends that didn't understand and some friendships fizzled out and others well... we've been friends for fifty some odd years.   Best of wishes to you and yours  \n\nNTA", "NTA. As you get older and move onto new stages of your life (i.e. new jobs, marriage, children, etc.), things change. I have had friends like that who weren\u2019t respectful of the fact that my job is demanding and always tried to make me feel bad about missing out on things. They are not in my life anymore as I didn\u2019t need that. \n\nThe fact that he makes you give him a make up day for a day you missed it super weird. I\u2019d put my foot down and let him know how you feel. If he\u2019s not cool with a \u201csee you when I see you\u201d type of friendship, I\u2019d dump him. I think your wife is right about this guy and I think you know it too.", "He\u2019s not being respectful of your time or boundaries, and he\u2019s using you for all of his social needs.

Whoever can make it makes it, but we don\u2019t change the day or do makeup days.  I\u2019m in my 40\u2019s w/ no kids and I\u2019m like you I have responsibilities and a job so just changing the day or schedule is not that simple", "NTA", "NTA. That\u2019s major clingwrap. He wants a substitute day? LOL that\u2018s not how it works. You don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d him your time. He\u2019s going to need to learn the meaning of the word NO. Tell him you are spread too thin, and feel you have not been making your family a priority, therefore you are dialing back on personal outings with friends.  Hang out once or twice a month - sure, but thats it as you will be spending more time with family.", "NTA you want different levels of commitment etc", "NTA. I know couples who struggle to spend this much time together!!!", "Bro I have zero responsibilities and would hate this, NTA.", "NTA- he\u2019s just being too much and very needy. If something comes up, just say, \u201cI\u2019ll see you next week\u201d. If he\u2019s upset, you\u2019ll see less of him.", "Something everyone has to deal with as we age is that free time becomes a precious fucking commodity. Hanging out with someone at 16? Easy. 23? Should be fine. 30-40 with kids? It's a fucking unicorn. My friend group is lucky to get a ***group*** gathering ***once a month*** where we can all physically be present.\n\nYou have had the serious conversation with him about this, and he is unreceptive. It might be time to distance yourself and only see him on your terms. People who refuse to accept that they aren't the main character in everyone's world will do all they can to disrupt your life to monopolize your time. Gotta shut that down.\n\nNTA.", "You could make it a monthly thing for some consistency and to make sure your friend knows you're not completely bailing on them, if you want to keep them as your friend. I would still mention that things may come up but you will try to give him advance notice if possible. NTA.", "NTA at all\n\nThis is simply the classic \u201clives going separate ways\u201d part of people\u2019s lives.\n\nYou\u2019re in two different stages of life and you are being a responsible adult taking care of family and work duties. He unfortunately won\u2019t understand now but later he\u2019ll come to learn what you meant.\n\nSo no NTA", "NTA He hasn't discovered what I learned after my divorce. Hanging out with married people kinda sucks when you're single. Didn't spend time with most of my married friends after my divorce. mostly went fishing/hunting with the dudes.\n\nReasons why: It's hard to get married people to go out, and if they do, usually want to go home too early.\n\nThe dude is lonely obviously. He needs a wingman, not a married friend.", "NTA. I've lost countless friend dates to \\*gasp\\* my friend's CHILDREN. It is as it should be.", "NTA, but as a mediterranean it will always wonder why you won't just take your children with you to meet your friends.  \n\nStill, if you don't feel comfortable with your current situation set a boundry, 1ce every 2 weeks, count the coffee as the weekly meet up. Maybe invite him along when you meet other people.", "NTA, your friend needs to expand his friend group because you just don't have the time.", "Your friend is the issue, not you. I've been where you are - it ended the friendship eventually. Hopefully you guys can sort it out. NTA.", "NTA\n\n Does he have a crush on you?? Just tell him you're busy with your family.", "NTA towards him....verging on AH to all your other responsibilities. Every time you hang out with him, your wife is home with 3 kids.\n\n\nIt sounds like he's at an age where many of his friends are probably at a different stage and he's lonely. But he's not making an effort to do different things....there are meetups, hobbies, classes, etc that he can do with his time. You're probably the one friend who regularly says yes. \n\nDid you hang out all the time before marriage and kids?\n\n\nExplain again that you can't see him that often. He needs to hear the hard truth that you have kids, a wife, a job, and other friends, and you need some of that time. Make an effort to invite him out occasionally...1-2x a month so he doesn't feel completely like it's person (\"I hate hanging out with you,\") but hopefully gets it that he can't be your biggest priority.", "NTA. If you want to solve this problem, get your wife on board and set him up with someone. Once he\u2019s in a relationship he\u2019ll stop bugging you.", "He doesn't get you now but he will someday. Try compromising, like once every 2 weeks or once every month. It really depends how good of friends you are. Otherwise, just distance yourself from him and eventually stop talking to him. he needs to find other friends.\n\nNTA", "You need to get on top of this sooner rather than later. How about suggesting the first Monday of every month or something like that? NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She thinks he\u2019s majorly clingy and has no real interest in spending time with him, plus when she\u2019s out I\u2019ve got the kids and when I\u2019m out she has the kids", "Oh, most of us understand. I have no partner nor children - but it would be pretty lacking empathy, to not understand friends (with family) now have less time. And indeed, many people (without partner/children) often change around that age, anyway - for other reasons.  I began to lose interest myself in my late 20s/early 30s, in hanging out with friends so regularly.\n\nWith me, it was more like I was growing into my identity, and my own self-confidence. Earlier in adulthood, you're still working out more who you are, navigating how to deal with adult life, problems, relationships, etc. Frequent contact with friends, can be valuable peer support at that developmental stage. \n\nBut as you get older, and develop - many people don't have the same emotional needs anymore. You function better as your own independent person. In my early 20s, there would be many personal situations that would lead to a same-day meeting between friends, to analyse/brainstorm on. But by my early 30s, it wouldn't even occur to me to consult friends on similar issues (at least not so quickly). \n\nYou still love and value your friends, and enjoy the time you spend with them. But to be brutally honest, the novelty also wears off, re: spending time three times a week with the same friend, doing similar things. You just don't have the same emotional need for it. \nOP's friend sounds like he's struggling a little. He's not comprehending the logic that OP has less time. And he's relying on the same one friend, to keep meeting his emotional needs. \n\nBut it's too needy - he needs to develop wider friendship circles, if he still wants a lot of contact with friends. And work out ways to be more emotionally independent.", "Fair enough. Neither parties in that situation are wrong I guess, just different", "Yeah. My ex & I were friends with several couples since our 20's. Some of the men, I was friends with before I met her. We have things in common, hobbies like hunting & fishing. \n\nMarriage & kids transitions your life. Your friend either has to adapt to that if he wants to remain your friend. \n\nThis was true for me. Maybe for some other people You immerse yourself in your family. Your family becomes part of you. I never realized til after my ex and I split & my time with my kids went to 50/50."]}
