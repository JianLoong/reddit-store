You have the right to be \"too busy\" to see your friend.  You're married with children; he's single.  If anything, it seems like your friendship with him is intruding on other friendships and your family's time with you.  That is not healthy. A compromise might be to include him in some of your family events such as trips to the Zoo, kids' sporting events, and similar.", "INFO why do you have to hang out alone? Does he not like your wife?", "NTA, anyway you can include him when you see other friends or are all your visits one on one.

I'm also married in my 30s, and there's no way I'd agree to see anyone who doesn't live in my home once a week. That's too much.

Make the plans you want to make and decline the ones you aren't into or can't make.

He can go find other friends with more availability, I guess.", "You have a very busy life.  You aren't obligated to squeeze him into your already busy schedule.  Yet friends are generally a welcome relief from the demands ones family requires.   And work is an obligation that actually comes before anyone because without work there's no food on the table nor a roof over their heads.   \n\nDon't let guilt control your decision making.   A friendship is one of devotion, love, compassion, respect and understanding.    An understanding that you can't just drop what you're doing to even have a cup of coffee, nor catch up on the latest of what's going on in your lives.  Appears he needs the time he spends with you.  Your plate is full.   \n\nI've been married fifty years.  We've raised our family.  We have grandchildren.  We have our furry babies.  We have retired.

You're probably the one friend who regularly says yes. \n\nDid you hang out all the time before marriage and kids?\n\n\nExplain again that you can't see him that often.

I have no partner nor children - but it would be pretty lacking empathy, to not understand friends (with family) now have less time. And indeed, many people (without partner/children) often change around that age, anyway - for other reasons.  I began to lose interest myself in my late 20s/early 30s, in hanging out with friends so regularly.\n\nWith me, it was more like I was growing into my identity, and my own self-confidence. Earlier in adulthood, you're still working out more who you are, navigating how to deal with adult life, problems, relationships, etc. Frequent contact with friends, can be valuable peer support at that developmental stage. \n\nBut as you get older, and develop - many people don't have the same emotional needs anymore. You function better as your own independent person. In my early 20s, there would be many personal situations that would lead to a same-day meeting between friends, to analyse/brainstorm on. But by my early 30s, it wouldn't even occur to me to consult friends on similar issues (at least not so quickly). \n\nYou still love and value your friends, and enjoy the time you spend with them. But to be brutally honest, the novelty also wears off, re: spending time three times a week with the same friend, doing similar things. You just don't have the same emotional need for it. \nOP's friend sounds like he's struggling a little. He's not comprehending the logic that OP has less time. And he's relying on the same one friend, to keep meeting his emotional needs. \n\nBut it's too needy - he needs to develop wider friendship circles, if he still wants a lot of contact with friends. And work out ways to be more emotionally independent.", "Fair enough. Neither parties in that situation are wrong I guess, just different", "Yeah. My ex & I were friends with several couples since our 20's. Some of the men, I was friends with before I met her. We have things in common, hobbies like hunting & fishing. \n\nMarriage & kids transitions your life. Your friend either has to adapt to that if he wants to remain your friend. \n\nThis was true for me. Maybe for some other people You immerse yourself in your family. Your family becomes part of you. I never realized til after my ex and I split & my time with my kids went to 50/50.", "NTA, I guess, but this just sounds like a weird scenario. Contrary to american hyperindividualist culture, your friendships are as important as your romantic relationships. One of the biggest reasons marriages fail is bc men usually are terrible at maintaining support systems outside their wives, and this leads to burnout. Do you not have a support system to handle the childcare burden? Can your friends not spend time with you and the kids? Also, it is probably healthy for your children to have other adult figures that they can rely upon or confide in beyond their parents, so...", "NTA.  This guy is the type of guy that believes friends have to see eachother often.  This is not true.  As we age & our lives change so do our friendships.  And so does the time we spend with these friends.  He cannot understand this as he is single with no obligations.  This friend seems to be high maintenance.  And at some point high maintenance friends become exhausting & it's time to end the friendship.", "NTA. Our lives change as we get older.  I am the friend without kids or a husband. I worry about bothering everyone who does have children. Am I cutting into their family time? Are they busy doing homework or bedtime? I\u2019m the kind of person that can go king periods of time without seeing friends though. I\u2019ll see them when it\u2019s convenient for us all. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d tell him that you can only give him one guaranteed day a month. Any other times will have to be on a case by case basis.", "NTA at all, he\u2019s being way too clingy", "You've hit the crux of the matter. The 'friend' believes he's OWED and ENTITLED to OP's time - regardless of OP's needs. True friends compromise, consider the other person's needs, and respect boundaries. But just as people can be selfish in obtaining everything else in the world (money, possessions, fun, whatever), they can be selfish about meeting their emotional needs, also. \n\nAnd this 'friend' is being wholly selfish. He knows OP doesn't have the time, and OP is suffering because of his demands - but he keeps at it, because he feels others are responsible for meeting his needs (at detriment to their own). And unfortunately, it's very difficult to induce a personality transplant in those people. They attach themselves like leeches to people who are 'too nice' to say no. \n\nBut you're responsible for meeting your own needs, as adults - which means you try to increase your friend circle, if you want more time hanging with friends (instead of exhausting just one friend, like OP). Here's OP feeling all guilty, but that's because the 'friend' is deliberately guilting him with these expectations. NTA, OP. But you have to learn how to set boundaries with him.", "Hell, I'm in my 40s now, without partner/children. But meeting once a week, every week, with the same friend...it would generally be too much for ME, also. Even though I love and value my friends, and enjoy the time I spend with them. \n\nIt's not just about having other commitments with family, etc (though that's a major factor for many people, of course). I do think many people (as they get older), just don't have the same emotional need, to spend so much time with the same friend. You've already 'been there, done that' with more intense friendships in your youth - and many people are also more emotionally independent, so don't need the same emotional input from friends. \n\nSure, it's fine if both people want to. But plenty don't, and/or plenty also have other time commitments. So OP's friend needs to wake up, before he alienates OP.  For whatever the reason, the friend isn't realising friendships often change as you get older. Unless a friend is available and willing, you can't expect them to meet so many of your emotional needs. It's needy and unrealistic, to make such demands on their time.", "That thought popped into my head, too.", "It's not necessarily a crush. It's maybe just because he's single - and he also hasn't become very emotionally independent, it seems. So he's unrealistically trying to rely on OP, to meet his emotional needs (for company and support) so regularly.\n\nSome people are just selfish in that way. They don't adapt to a changing situation. They still want everyone to meet THEIR needs, on their terms - without compromise and consideration for other people's needs. Really, if OP has tried to explain his time commitments, and the friend still isn't taking it into account...it's time for OP to set boundaries.", "Sounds like your friend's social circle consists of you and him. Wonder if he has trouble making friends, which is why he clings to the only one he's got.", "I think he's in the wrong. By demanding 'substitute' days (plus business as usual the following week), he clearly thinks you OWE that time to him - and you have to 'compensate' him, if you 'shortchange' him. That's quite the entitlement complex, unfortunately. \n\nSure, he may be lonely, but a lot of people are. They can't going around EXPECTING other people to meet their emotional needs - at detriment to the other people. \n\nYou've explained to him your time commitments. It shouldn't be that hard to understand (married or not), that every week is a large chunk of your available FREE time. A reasonable friend would respect your boundaries. Instead, he just continues to selfishly demand you meet his needs, regardless of your own.\n\nHE is principally responsible for meeting his OWN needs, in a way that respects other people's needs and boundaries. So if he's lonely, he needs to expand his circle of friends - not demand you meet his needs for him. You need to just say 'no', and stick to it. HE needs to learn how to be a better friend - not you.", "Stop hanging with him weekly, how about that? There is absolutely no need and he is being very needy and intrusive. \"I have to cut back on these hangouts to like once or twice a month. I have too many family commitments with my children and wife and I need some me time and time with other friends, and I can't do these as often as you want. I'm think this will upset you and I'm sorry for that, but this is going to be how it is going forward.\" NTA and do this in a place where you can easily get away, do not let him argue with you.\n\nHe starts text bombing you or calling to argue or just phone bombing, 20 missed calls type stuff and he gets blocked until the next time you want to talk to him. I suggest filling your voicemail before you have this encounter.", "NTA.  Just say no, can't do it today.", "Oof, I can relate to this...unfortunately on his side. NTA btw, he's overextending. I have a friend that I probably put too much on to hang out as well, and it's been a real journey to come to terms with the idea that them hanging out with other people might make me jealous/make me feel like they don't like me as much as I like them, but that's not reality. Your friend needs a good reflecting period to understand that he's putting a strain on your relationship. \n\nBy getting your time and hangouts now, he's overall destroying the chances of consistent and pleasant meetings between you in the long term. He's tapping the well a little too dry, basically, and will wind up ruining the relationship he so badly wants to preserve. I would have a gentle and honest discussion with him that you value and enjoy your time together but he's starting to impose a bit too much and its making it harder to satisfy his expectations. Does he want a long term consistent friendship with you, understanding he won't always be your priority? Or does he want to try and scrounge for every scrap of time with you he can get and ultimately tire you out and make you avoid him? Sustainability, you know? Sorry you're going through this, it cannot be easy.", "Fully onboard with everyone who says NTA, and that you don't \"owe\" him your time. That said, you don't say anything about your work situation. If you work outside the home, how about agreeing to meet him for lunch (as often as you are willing, i.e., not necessarily once a week)? That is not family time, won't impact your wife, and is strictly time limited - \"Sorry, bud. Gotta go back to work now! Nice seeing ya.\"", "A \"substitute day\" you don't owe him your time. NTA You're busy, you have a job, you have kids and you have a wife I'm sure you want to spend time with. He can't rely on you for all his social needs and he isn't entitled to your time at all. If it's possible to do this without him getting super upset, gently encourage him to find more friends. Tell him you like him and like being with him but you aren't very available and it's nice to have multiple friends.", "NTA\n\n\nAlso perhaps your friend can come visit you at your house sometimes so you combine family and friend at that time? It is much easier to find a time where you can  invite a friend over to hang out with you and your family than it is to find time for one-on-one time outside of your house.", "Your friend has no other friends, and no respect for your time.\n\nYou have a life.  You have a family, a job, and other commitments.\n\nHe hasn't heard you in the past and is taking advantage of you.\n\nI would start turning him down every time he makes a request to see you, or if he pops up for an impromptu coffee.  \n\nIf he starts asking why you aren't spending time him, tell him that you are busy and he didn't hear you when you have said you were busy in the past. \n\nNTA", "Unfortunately I work in London a lot and I live up north, about 2 hours away", "NTA.

I am also struggling with trying to keep up with and keep in contact with even my closest friends from all these previous life stages while also keeping up with the people I am surrounded by and know now. It was really relieving to read your perspective and understand that the nature of what we need from friendships and what we can provide for ourselves is supposed to change as we age.", "This is what came to my mind.
