(It\u2019s not like a free prize you still have to pay) And I actually won 2 tickets in October for one of the shows last week. \n\nIn the past I told Molly if I someday won the tickets I\u2019d take her but my boyfriend Lucas also really wanted to go. And when I won he told me if I took him he\u2019d pay for gas, a nice meal out and a hotel which is a big help as otherwise it\u2019s pretty tricky to get home the same night as the show ends late. And I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a hotel for me and Molly. So we turned it into a date 2 day trip away for us. \n\nSo I didn\u2019t tell Molly I won the tickets, I only told her after I went that Lucas had bought me tickets (a lie I know but I thought it was a white lie). She was a bit sad but fine. Then our mom told her that I got the tickets in the raffle and she freaked. Saying I know how much she wanted to go and im her sister and I should have her back over some guy etc etc. I said I always wanted to go too and he\u2019s not just some guy he\u2019s my bf of 1 year and he turned it into a proper trip away for us which we\u2019ve never done before. And that the last time we spoke about the raffle was like a year ago when I barely knew Lucas and things have changed quite a bit with us since then. and I will still keep doing the raffle so she can go. She\u2019s still mad at me tho \ud83d\udc80\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanna say that we are totally fine and still texting and talking and stuff, she\u2019s not devastated and despite what some of you are implying our friendship is not irreparably destroyed. Tho I am about to send her this post because she will get a lot of joy out of you all calling me a douche lol.

Molly is going remember you bailed on her for a guy you've known for 12 months and you're going to have basically the same memory, just with some weak self-serving rationalizations sprinkled on top.

Now though, she is probably sad about the show, but it probably upset her more to find out that you lied to her.", "YTA.

I think the reason you didn't tell her is you know your decision is hard to justify, or you're embarrassed. You basically exposed the price you would accept in exchange for your sister's happiness.

So you think sister would have been happier if OP had won tickets, been unable to manage the logistics and then sold them and nobody got to go?  Because that's how it sounds. \"If I can't go, then nobody should go\" rather than- \"well, I'm glad you got to go, I still hope we can go someday.\"  the problem is that OP did lie to her instead of just be honest and explain the reality that at this point in time, the dream that the two sisters had wasn't likely possible, even with won tickets.", ">The fault was in lying to her as a child rather than just being honest. \"I won the tickets but I cannot manage the transportation stuff at this time.

That name checks out. Also glad to know you consider lying to someone, especially your own sister, is a-okay, as long as it covers your tracks when you break promises.\n\nBy the way, I didn't say that OP's sister would never ***talk*** to her again. I said she would never ***trust*** her again. And there's no reason she should. When OP says she \"promises\" something that means, \"I promise unless a cute guy comes along and I'd rather spend a two day outing with him.

Then, to cover her tracks, she lies again.\n\nAlso, I never said that the relationship was over, per se. What I meant was, it will never be the same. And it won't be.\n\nIf your sibling promised you something, something that they ***knew*** was very important to you, then ditched you in favor of a significant other that they've only known for about a year, how would that make you feel?\n\nBut we're not done. Suppose, to cover their tracks, your sibling then lies to you about  it.\n\nBut we're still not done.

I mean, OP is here, asking if she did anything wrong. \"Oh, tee-hee-hee, it was just a little white lie.\"\n\nI mean, I haven't read that the OP's apologized. What's she waiting for? Our judgment to know if she needs to apologize for breaking her promise and lying about it? Apparently, she doesn't think she did anything all that terrible.\n\nWould your relationship with your sibling be the same after that? Would you trust them again? If your answer is \"yes,\" I submit you need to acquire some self-respect.", "People are pretty over Hamilton now tbh, even in the theater world in my experience. The novelty is pretty much over. But yeah most NYC Broadway shows have tickets starting at about 70-90 a pop if you want the nosebleeds.", ">it wasn\u2019t about choosing one person or another.\n\nNo, that is exactly what it was about.", "Because you did, and broke a promise on top of it. You can joke in this reddit all you want, the damage is done and you've forever changed how your sister will see you", "You know, there's one thing about you that really, really bugs me.\n\nYou haven't even told us that you apologized to your sister. You're here asking us whether it was okay for you to ditch your sister in favor of a cute guy so you could have a nice two-day outing. Then you lied to her about it. No, you didn't tell a \"white lie.\" A \"white lie\" is telling someone that their new dress that they absolutely love is gorgeous even when you think it's hideous.\n\nThis was not a \"white lie.\" It was a \"cover-your-ass lie.\" Props to your mother, by the way. You lied to your sister, and she didn't let you get away with it. Sounds like you have a good mom who's willing to call you out on your bullshit.\n\nIncredibly, you don't seem to think you have anything to apologize for!", "I was able to buy two tickets when I won the raffle.", "Well that is righteous lol", "I asked if both you and your friend  bought raffle tickets?", "And you didn't even notice that she spelled it wrong.", "if she can't do it, she can't do it. I don't know what else to tell you, but you do see that they're both young, right? So if you're hanging your hat on the fact that OP said it and she was unable to make it happen, therefore she's an AH, then I'm just not going to agree to that. With age and experience one learns to temper one's words more carefully.\n\nIt was an aspirational goal as much as it is a promise. And it can still be in effect for a time when she is actually able to do it. So, in that sense it was unfortunate that she won the tickets at a time when she was unable to make the rest of it happen. But THAT doesn't make her an AH. Going with her bf who was able to take care of the logistics doesn't make her the AH.  \n\nBut she shouldn't have lied. I get why she did it. It's the sort of \"white lie\" that one will tell a child to spare them a harsh reality. But as I often have told my own children... the coverup is almost always worse than the crime. Just own it. OP should have owned it and explained to her sister what the real choices were. (I go with BF or nobody goes)\n\nIn another sense, the entitled reaction of sister does go some way to explain why OP wanted to avoid the conversation because if she argued that in her view, sister was never going to understand the reality, she just wants to go or be pissed, everything else be damned- well- from the reaction we read in the post- I got no grounds to disagree with her.", "Respectfully, YTA. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is why no one trusts each other anymore, Promises are always broken :(", ">In the past I told Molly if I someday won the tickets I\u2019d take her\n\n>So I didn\u2019t tell Molly I won the tickets, I only told her after I went that Lucas had bought me tickets (a lie)\n\nWe done here? Seriously are you an asshole if you set expectations, don't follow through, then lie to cover your ass? You tell me OP", "YTA if your bf can afford all that he could have gotten his own ticket. I hope you\u2019re saving up to get your sister that ticket.", "YTA. You TOLD her you would take her if you won. Then you won and took your BF because he made the trip a more attractive option. You need to own going back on your word.", "My parents did to me all the time. Made a promise and then would never follow through and if I called them on it they would do some amazing mental gymnastics to justify why they broke another promise. As a result, I don\u2019t really trust their promises anymore.\n\nYTA OP, and though as you said in your edit this won\u2019t cause irreparable damage, what it will do is likely cause your sister to think twice before trusting the next promise you make. Glad you can at least admit you were wrong, because that\u2019ll be the first step in gaining trust again.", "Right? Acting like siblings can\u2019t handle conflicts in their relationships like mature adults. Healthy people move on , my sister and I have had some big fights and at the end of the day she\u2019s still my best friend. Things aren\u2019t always so extreme and black and white. Also think it\u2019s toxic when people would cut a loved one out of their life for a lie that isn\u2019t even that serious, if your love and trust is that fragile you need therapy.", "I won the raffle and doing so, I was able to buy two tickets so I gave her the second. She didn\u2019t have to pay me back.", "Again, did both of you buy (separate) raffle tickets?", "I don\u2019t know how to make this clearer. We both entered the raffle. I won the raffle. I was able to buy two tickets, one for me and one for her. She did not buy anything. She was given the second ticket I purchased when I won the raffle.", "So that is more of a commitment.  It is not clear in this OP if both OP and her sister bought raffle tickets and agreed to take the other.  It is like sister had no skin in the game, other that she loves Hamilton.", "YTA\n\nYou made a promise and you broke it. She has a right to be upset.", "YTA. Did you at least apologize? Or are you making more excuses for yourself?", "YTA\n\nThere's something to be said for keeping your word.", "Missed out on a wholesome bonding sister trip even if you cannot afford a hotel, it would\u2019ve been enough for me, so it\u2019s hard for me to understand but ig you do you", "And btw a lie is a lie. No such thing as a white lie.", "It's a ticket lottery, not a raffle. It's free to enter (link on the Hamilton web site or through the app), you indicate whether you are entering for one or two tickets. When you are notified that you won, you have an hour to pay for the tickets ($10 each,  i.e., a Hamilton). Source: have received tickets multiple times.", "Oh that weird, ok", "YTA but that's not why I'm commenting. Manhattan hotel rooms can be had for $100 a night right after the Holidays and tickets will surely be reduced as well. How about making it up to her if you can?", "YTA don't write checks you cant cash. No one forced you to say you'd take her but you did, why say it if you weren't going to do it", "YTA", "YTA. Not only did you go back on your word, you lied about it. How are you even asking if your the AH. Explain to me how you aren\u2019t?", "YTA. The tickets aren\u2019t even that expensive. The t-shirts are. Take the poor girl.", "YTA. As a younger sister this would put a decent dent in the relationship. Especially over a bf of a year? Not cool at All"]}
