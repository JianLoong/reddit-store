He then called me a brat for expecting everyone to pay for me while I waste my money on HRT and surgeries I don't need. \n\n>-They replaced my weight gain powder with weight loss powder.\n\n>-Oh they have stolen from me before. They broke my very expensive art set, stole my food that I got from my doctor due to my ED (it's a special supplement) and even hid my medication from me.\n\nThis is a pattern of abuse from OP's brother. OP, you are not safe, your mental health is suffering, and you need to find a way out.", "They don't work. I did mention it somewhere but can't find the exact comment. Basically, they just don't want to. They always use uni as an excuse to be too busy to work but I think they still fail to understand that we are all the lucky few who don't have to work and study at the same time. \n\nThey can afford it, they just don't want to pay me back and at the end of the day that's okay. Even just anapology would be enough.", "How is that relevant, when clearly OP isn\u2019t in the US?", "It seems like a lot to me. Most people eat 1 or 2 in a day. That would be 4 per person, so I could see them eating 8. 10 in one weekend seems like a lot.", "The second point isn't from this post and and don't think it's needed here. Please remove it as it mentions things I'm not comfortable having here this point in time.", "Please OP look at this it very much is abuse even if you aren't seeing this pattern yourself. Trans people experience abuse at a rate over 4 times higher than cis gender averages. Changing someone's food powder/eating all of there baked goods is not normal behavior and is especially bad considering you are recovering from an ED that almost hospitalized you. You should attempt to limit the contact they can have with you food in the future to protect your own physical and mental health. OP you are NTA, but please try to get yourself to a position you dont have to live with these people because there actions only show they will continue to escalate not change there behavior.", "I celebrated my ED recovery in a totally different way, but whatever floats OPs boat...is what I thought for a couple minutes until the lightbulb lit.", "Maybe not.  It's a basic tactic, so basic some people don't even realize they are doing it.\n\nBtw -are you in South Africa?  I'm just guess due to the currency mentioned.", "Hey OP if you can budget for a new fridge lock there\u2019s locks that glue onto the fridge, you can also use them for cabinets. I have them in my work space (a shared leased space) because I pay for things that my cohabitant doesn\u2019t and we had an issue with this in the past. \nI\u2019ve been told \u201cgood locks make for good neighbors\u201d ironically by the same person taking my stuff. But that quote still stuck with me I guess.", "Yes I am! I'm pretty sure many people don't even take note of it or at least just skipped over it.", "I might buy the locks and lock my room after stuff gets done. I'm just wondering how they're going to survive when I'm not home for 3 weeks since I'm taking my food (that they often eat) with me.", "Your roommates suck and owe you the money for replacement items.  I'm so sorry they're being such jerks. Congratulations on your achievements.  I wish you continued success.", "ok with the addition of the detail about the weight gain powder switch up \u2026 yeah thats a different level of toxic and their intentions  seem harmful \u2026 sending you love :/", "I randomly learned how to change locks a few years ago doing side work for my uncle. It\u2019s actually not super difficult and probably worth learning to have peace of mind", "It sounds like you are in a tough position already and I\u2019m glad to hear about the locks. But Feeding themselves is their problem to deal with", "Its quite easy but the contractor will need to get into my room so this way I'm not worried about them making a copy since I told the contractor to only give me a key to the new locks."]}
