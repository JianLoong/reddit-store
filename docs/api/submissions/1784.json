They also went on to call me selfish and entitled for assuming they had money to waste on food that they won't even eat.\n\nI'm still upset they ate all the muffins but I'm wondering if maybe I should have not have asked them to pay me back?

This means you can also eat their food.", "NTA. You clearly set the expectation that they could have a few.  They are them all. This is on them.  \n\nThey are trying to throw up smokescreens by saying that you should have hid them,  or that they can't tell the difference between high and low quality chocolate,  or that they can't afford to replace the ingredients.  Those are distractions.  The only point that matters is that you said they could have a few and they ate them all.

I get that they can\u2019t tell the difference between cheap and expensive ingredients and may not have been aware of the expensive ingredients you used.

I would come home with gifts from my friends, planned to eat them the next day after work and when I come back from work, the food would already be gone.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA for being upset about your brother and his gf eating all the muffins you made. They didn't even leave you one. You put in a lot of time baking, and the ingredients were not cheap. If they have any decency left, they will pay up for the cost of ingredients.\n\nI hope you make a new batch. But learn from this mistake and keep them in your room next time.", "NTA.

Despite the fact your brother and his gf are older than you, they still act like children. You were clear about them having one or two, but for them to eat the entirety of what you made without even telling you is just greedy and rude. *They should 100% pay you back!*\n\nMoving forward I suggest you sit them down and have a discussion about food sharing moving forward. Make your boundaries clear. Come up with a system. If they continue to disrespect you - I suggest rigging your food so they stop taking it. There are other precautions you can take in the future too if they continue to steal your food with no regard. \n\nIf they act like this, they might be more inclined to use/take your things without asking as well. So i\u2019d double check on that front. \n\nSounds like you made some really tasty treats though. Kudos! All the best.", "NTA\nYou should not have to hide food from adults to make sure they don't eat it.  They ate 10-20 times the amount you said they could have, then had the audacity to blame you.

It sounds to me like the brother\u2019s GF is causing a wedge between OP and their Brother. If she is living there full time, then the bills need to be split in thirds. End of discussion. They need to pony up the $10 they ate, and move on. They\u2019re gaslighting and trying to deflect by not paying or replacing said muffins.
