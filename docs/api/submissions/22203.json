The classic example of this is Korchnoi vs. Kasparov in 1978 \u2014 [Korchnoi wore mirror sunglasses to break Kasparov\u2019s concentration, plus all kinds of other shenanigans](https://chess24.com/en/read/news/the-dirtiest-match-in-chess-history-michael-stean-on-karpov-korchnoi-1978). \n\nSmoking at the table lends itself to all sorts of nasty behavior like blowing in your opponent\u2019s face or flicking hot ashes at them. This is why it\u2019s usually banned at tournaments. What the other player did was a major, flagrant breach of the rules and deserved to be disqualified.", "NTA!\nAnd a win is a win.\nForget this and make the very best if your education. Never look back.\n\nAll the best to you", "NTA. The arbiters should have seen the rule violation and instead waited for someone to complain. What if you were asthmatic or smoking triggered migraines? That would have given your opponent an unfair advantage. Your opponent chose to flaunt the rules and you called him on it. Good luck in college!", "NTA\n\nSomeone that breaks the rules of the game during game play deserves to be called out. \n\nThe arbitrator made the call and decided they DID break the rules and disqualified them. (*seriously - what were they thinking?*)\n\n>Other players started turning around and giving me angry looks.\n\nMaybe they were giving *him* angry looks for smoking. \n\nIn any case, Your not the AH for expecting everyone to follow the same rules while playing a tournament with a huge prize pool.", "Of course not! I played in tournaments in elementary school (although of course no 5th grader ever even thought of bringing cigarettes into the building so smoking wasn't an issue) and rules are rules. Period. \n\n\nI am playing chess in the daycare center where I work this summer, and I have a co worker who taught kids wrong rules. I say \"if you play with me we play by the standard rules...\"; kids don't like it and say the co teacher is who they believe. Fine. But find another opponent. I am sorry you got bad information, but I won't further fees into it...even if a daycare center environment.\n\nBut there are also valid reasons this is a rule:\nIt's a distraction...to all players.\nThe smell and smoke can make people uncomfortable or even sick.\nIt's a health hazard for anyone to breathe in second hand smoke.\nIt could even be a fire hazard to have lit cigarettes near the papers where people write down games.\nIt makes the set smell like smoke. \n\nI am amazed that anyone thought they could just light up during a game, and you did the right thing to report it.\n\nOf course in adult tournaments players smoke...top kid players who move to adult tournaments are often surprised that between moves players leave the board and smoke. But you can't do it while playing, and that isn't a like winning by not saying check and then declaring victory because the opponent didn't see check and move. It's not an AH move.", "This sounds odd.  Smoking is forbidden yeti her starts doing so publicly?  Too bad I guess.  What did he expect to happen?", "NTA. \nRules of the tournament say 'no smoking', they busted that rule therefore they forfeit their position.\nSubjecting anyone to smoking without their consent is not cool.", "NTA. Rules are there for a reason. Some people might not want to inhale toxic gases.", "Nta if you did it for rule violation or because you don't like cigarette smoke. Slight ah if you didn't care about the rules or smoking and only did it to get him disqualified.", "NTA. You are technically correct, the best kind of correct!", "NTA - You did the right thing. Money or not, rules are rules. Maybe the smoke can disturb you? This rule makes sens and should be enforced.", "It depends if you noticed it earlier. If you noticed in, say, an earlier round even if he wasn\u2019t near you, and you didn\u2019t report it and you waited until the end on purpose, knowing he would be DQ\u2019ed, you would be the AH. \n\nHowever, if you just noticed and immediately reported it, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s definitely not a way you should be proud of winning, however you followed the rules and smoking is dangerous, even just to inhale. Like as long as you don\u2019t go around bragging to everyone how you got him DQ\u2019ed, you are okay.", "NTA. Everyone understands the rules and the penalties for violating them.", "Yeah you are bc this isn\u2019t real. You don\u2019t automatically get third place bc you called someone out for smoking lol. It would move you to third place to compete for first or second. Plus you just happened to compete in a competition and \u201cwon\u201d third place by chance because someone broke the rules and it just happened to be the amount you needed to go to college?

The tournament arbiter(s) should have been paying attention and if it was in the middle of the game they could have.\n\nPlayers are always free to point an arbiter's attention to an opponent's behaviour when it's against the rules. It's up to the arbiter to decide on how to respond to the infraction.   Depending on circumstances an immediate loss may or may not be in order, but that was not for OP to decide anyway.\n\nNTA", "Thanks!", "Yeah, you do. \n\n1. When 3rd place gets removed from tournament table everyone below him move up the place. 4th to 3rd, 5th to 4th, etc.\n2. I got de-facto win in the game, since my opponent was disqualified in the middle of the game. This was also the final round as I pointed out in the post.\n3. I specifically picked the competition where I could get enough money. There is no shortage of them.\n4. Survivorship bias. If the game wasn't smoking this wouldn't have been made into AITA post."]}
