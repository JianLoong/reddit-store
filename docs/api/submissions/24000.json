It is a serious problem if you had to force her to apologize. You couldn't have raised her well if she is making those kinds of jokes.

However, the point still stands. If she marries him, he will want her to cut ties with her niece, someone she views as a daughter. I wouldn't want to marry someone like that, would you? Of course I wouldn't want to marry someone possibly racist either, so both parties should rethink this situation.", "Then he needs to leave altogether, the niece is basically OPs surrogate daughter and isn't going anywhere.", ":O\n\ni totally missed that comment!\n\nwell I can totally why it was left out of the original post! Thanks!", "It was two years ago so not 17 but 15, she's apologised, arguments about how she was forced are irrelevant, I've never seen a teenager apologise without an authority figure forcing it.\n\nAlso, while I agree it's a decent reason to not like someone the dude need to understand that girl is her surrogate daughter and like any daughter she come before the spouse.\n\nIf he can't accept the niece, then he needs to leave.", "Ya, I read that. After this comment I made. I still stand by it though. Just from the other side. She now needs to resolve this by making her neice/child truly make amends. It's not just an apology.
