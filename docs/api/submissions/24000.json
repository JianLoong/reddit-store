It is actually a lovely gesture to ask her and it is also, absolutely, up to you who choose. It seems pretty odd that he dislikes a child who is important to you.

Why doesn't he like her?", "What  would his side of the story be?\n\nIs the niece very rude to him or have behaviour problems?

It is frankly insane that your fiance dislikes your niece that damn much. \n\n\n(Although help me out, doesn't a maid of honour normally help plan the bridal party/hen night? Would that not be difficult for a 17 year old?)", "NTA.  Does he pick things to dislike, even though you do? A narcissist cannot stand it if they aren't the center of attention and are jealous that your attention is somewhere else. Just a thought.", "NTA. Don\u2019t marry this person.", "Oohh, NTA\n\nBut please rethink this marriage. HE doesn't like her? And you're still with him? \n\nThis sounds like a marriage that will have built in levels of resentment from both sides.", "NTA.  Get to the root of why he dislikes her. I really think you two are incompatible.", "NTA. As far as I know, the bride and the groom get to pick who the bridesmaids are and who the groomsmen are. It\u2019s weird he is so dead set that she isn\u2019t your MOH. First off, this should set off a red flag because he is trying to control your decision. If this is how he\u2019s starting off the wedding planning and the engagement, think how he would be while you two are married. I would rethink this marriage", "NTA... \n\nIf you marry him without resolving their relationship to at least some civil degree, you become one, though. No real parent (bio or chosen) worth a damn would marry someone who craps on their kid if their kid did nothing wrong. I am sure she may not be a perfect person, but you definitely made it clear this is a him problem. Do not make his problems your child's problems. Also, if she does have fault in this you need to hold her accountable as well. \n\nKeep her, ditch him.", "yeah it has really made me rethink this marriage", "The niece made a racist joke towards the fiance and that's why he doesn't like her.

That\u2019s what I wanna know.\n\nAnd if he names a person, why did he pick *them*?\n\nIs is somebody he trusts to keep an eye on you? \n\nWhy is it so important it *not* be your seventeen year old cousin.

A rethink is definitely in order.", "Oh sweetheart, if he can treat a child this way then he isn't the man for you. He doesn't deserve you or your niece. I know it's hard to hear but you should be with someone who adores her like you do. Who gets why your relationship is so important and supports it wholeheartedly. He's not it. \n\nPlease take some time to really think hard about whether you want to be with someone who is so needlessly mean to a young woman who is almost a daughter to you. \n\nGood luck.

The joke was directed at him.  Did you defend him?  Do you have his back?\n\nCan you give other examples of her cheeky-ness?\n\nI ask because what you view as being cheeky, could be entitled behavior to others.", "So your niece is racist and you can't understand why he doesn't want her there? You left out important details yta", "You were NTA until I got to this comment. Now, ESH. \n\nINFO: Did your niece apologize? Did you speak with her about why racist jokes are unacceptable? Or did you let it slide and enable her ignorant behavior? \n\nI understand she is only 17, but if you consider yourself one of her parents, it is your responsibility to help her develop a strong set of ethics, or at least become educated on the harm done by racism.", "Interesting that you left that out and even now won't say what she said... teenager or not racism is pretty unnacceptable. It's one of the few reasons that can justify his actions big time.", "OP refers to her niece as the only child she'll ever have. She's helping to raise her. It's an AH move to bring a cruel person into a child's life as a 'stepfather'. Already at their wedding he's letting the child know she's not part of their new family.", "she is not racist it was just that one joke and she had learned it from a tv show. she is still my child no matter how she is", "THE WEDDING HASN'T HAPPENED YET. OP has not yet made a decision about her MOH. OP states in other comments that she is rethinking this marriage. She is NOT TA."]}
