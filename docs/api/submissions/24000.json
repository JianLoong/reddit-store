Obviously it wasn't and isn't, but when a kid (and 15 *is* a kid, she's in 9th or 10th grade) hears something that's said on a popular TV show she might think it's acceptable unless the show itself makes it clear that the remark or joke is not okay.\n\nI'd give the teenager the benefit of the doubt on this one, PROVIDED she apologized (even if told to do so - you need to understand the underlying offense before you can offer your own apology) AND (this is key) now understands exactly why that \"joke\" was racist and awful. If she has learned this, REALLY learned it, then it's now on the adults to understand that kids say stupid, thoughtless things without understanding what they're saying, and act accordingly.\n\nETA - if OP thought it was funny, then her fiance's problem should be with her and not the then 15-year-old niece.", "yes especially since OP doesn\u2019t get why he is upset that he is hurt. Red flag", "You don\u2019t get to be a racist and expect people to just accept your apology and welcome you with open arms.", "Jesus christ it was an edgy joke made by a 15 year old.", "the op said she thought it was funny and *she* wasn\u2019t a teenager. she definitely reinforced the behavior and encouraged it. she didn\u2019t use it as a teaching moment.", "As a teenager, she\u2019s literally a teenager in the 21st century not a fucking 4 your old saying what they heard on tv. It\u2019s pretty easy to not be racist, and especially not make a racist joke towards someone you barely know. Idk what context any normal teenager finds that appropriate. It doesn\u2019t matter if she was 14 when she said it", "She's 17.", "it\u2019s objectifying, dehumanizing, with that extra zing of reminding the person they\u2019re mocking that people like her used to keep slaves that looked like him. ever so funny. i may just bust a gut.", "I had to read it several times. I was like \u201cwhat is in their hand?\u201d. But the \u201cjoke\u201d is the first person is pointing at what is in the hand and the kid is talking about the person.", "Look no offence but they are all good points, but OP said she - an adult with a boyfriend of a different race - found it funny so I find it hard to trust her judgment.", "Yeah well when I remember stupid shit I said as a kid I'm mortified and extremely apologetic! Doesn't seem like that's the case here at all, especially if her mom is minimizing it and continues to minimize her very own husbands feelings??\n\nLike....... how is the niece meant to learn if everyone keeps going 'it's just a joke' 'you're just a kid'.. the fuck?", "Truth. It lets me hit edit, but when I try to send it, it says try again later and I can see its not updating. \n\nI hate technology \ud83d\ude11", "Then the bigger problem is with OP and not the niece. I wonder that OP's fiance didn't end things with OP, rather than placing blame on the teenager.", "My bigger concern here is around the two adults in the room. If OP, an adult, thought the \"joke\" was funny at the time then her fiance's real problem is with her and not the teenager.\n\nAnd even if the then 15-year-old WAS told to apologize, if that instructed apology was followed by a discussion of why the \"joke\" was racist and unacceptable, and if the teenager both expressed real understanding and remorse AND has not shown any evidence of racism since then, then it's on the adults to understand that teens say stupid things, and they also learn and grow. \n\nPersonal anecdote. When I was a teenager (can't remember the exact age) I owned the Broadway album from the show \"Hair\", and one song on the album had extremely racist lyrics. For some reason I liked that song - I SHOULD have understood the OBVIOUS racism of a White girl playing that song repeatedly, but clueless me was so focused on the beat and how strange the different pejoratives were that I didn't think it through. My father heard my playing that track several consecutive times and came into my room, asked my why, of all the songs on the album, I liked THAT one, and how would (name of Black family friend) feel if she heard me playing that song? And I had a real moment of clarity. Light-bulb moment. I learned something that day, namely, that just because a song was included on an album that had been popular for some years didn't mean that the words in the song were okay. So I am willing to give this teenager a pass if she learned something. On the other hand, OP initially finding the \"joke\" funny? That's a problem."]}
