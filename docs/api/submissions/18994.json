If her heart was absolutely set on a Pug, at least find a reliable breeder, because most purebred puppy store get their dogs from puppy mills.\r  \n\r  \nDespite asking for it, Emma ended up ignoring all of my advice. She went and bought the Pug \u201cMax\u201d from a puppy store because the nearest reputable breeder lived \u201ctoo far away\u201d from where she and Todd were willing to drive.

Emma and I spent most of our lives in Scottsdale. Where we live now, days are in the high eighties for most of the year.

I told Emma no way. I have actual human children that I need to provide for and they come first. Emma suggested that I ask my daughter if she would be okay with cancelling her swim classes to be able to afford Max\u2019s bills. I told Emma no and that I am not going to put that on my child\u2019s shoulders.\r  \n\r  \nThis is where some family members and a friend have called me an asshole; I told Emma that she isn\u2019t able to be a good owner right now.

Pugs are riddled with health issues, it\u2019s the harsh reality of how they\u2019ve been bred and it\u2019s incredibly unethical. \n\nTo then also not invest in pet insurance? I would see that as a *stupid call* even if they had chosen a breed that was less likely to suffer from health conditions. \n\nIt sounds like Max is a typical Pug when it comes to health complications.

Have often found people find honest, hard truths to be offensive though. Not having pet insurance is being an irresponsible owner. Queue people without insurance being raging though, so important to get it at the start because as here if they are sick later no one will insure them. It\u2019s possible to love your dog and have made bad decisions and it\u2019s easier to blame you than accept that she is responsible for this situation. Your words might have hurt her feelings but that doesn\u2019t mean she is entitled to your money at the expense of your kids.", "NTA \n\nYou warned her about purebred dogs, and pugs In particular.  She disregarded your advice and went to a pet store. Even though it is well known pet store dogs are often from puppy mills with lots of health issues. Then she decided to skip on pet insurance to boot and now going into debt. \n\nListen, I'm a pet lover. I have several special needs dogs that have a myriad of issues between them. I made that choice and put forth the money and sacrifices like no longer going out because a cat and a dog both needed emergency procedures that cost $3600 between the two of them. I do not ask others to help out. I cut my cable, streaming, and eating out instead. That's what a responsibility person does or they give the pet up to rescue.

Getting a purebred dog - or any dog, frankly - and not insuring it should be illegal for exactly this reason. \n\nI feel really sorry for Max, but you were upfront it was a bad idea.

If others feel that good pet owners should drain their savings and ask for handouts in order to care for the pet, tell them they are 100% free to praise those efforts and financially support said animal, but that you'll have to agree to disagree because you said what you said and meant it. I'd say it too. Asking a parent (who forewarn the owner about this breed's medical problems and was ignored) to take cultural/performance experiences/training away from their own child, in order to pay medical bills for their sister's dog is totally unreasonable. And suggesting the child be drawn into the debacle and make HER responsible for the decision is tantamount to child abuse. Your sister is NOT being a good pet owner, nor a good human.

This breed needs to end, it is cruel to breed dogs to be unhealthy.", "NTA, she's not. Truth hurts. That poor dog is going to suffer because of her selfishness.
