{"id": 8658, "submission_id": "10oqlb2", "title": "AITA for not wanting to give my estranged mother US citizenship?", "selftext": "I (20F) got into a huge fight with my father and brother about not wanting to complete a petition to U.S. citizenship for my estranged mother whom I have not seen nor spoken to in years. My \"mother\" who had no part in raising me or supporting me financially, abandoned me when I was 8 years old. I was born in the US and am a citizen, but she is not. She lives in Spain, and I don't know much about her life because I have no contact with her. My dad raised me and my brother by himself without any child support, and life was pretty rough in a single parent household. What was so rough about it was that since my dad had to work all the time I had to do a lot of the housework myself and would often get seriously hurt because what 8 year old child should be in charge of making meals. My brother was only 4 when she eft and so I had to watch him a ot and take care of him which should not have been my responsibility as that was not my child and I was a child myself. \n\nWe had a really rough childhood experienced severe poverty I often feared we would end up homeless because my dad could not cover the bills. I have a lot of trauma from growing up poor and in a household where my emotional needs were not met. I've done so much to try and heal and move forward. I'm on track to graduate college in the spring and go on to graduate school so I would say l've done okay. What bothers me is that despite never receiving any support from my mother she now is planning to come \"visit\" in the US and my dad expects me to make her a citizen because I will turn 21 soon. He said I owe her that much because she birthed me but I was never raised by her and so I don't consider her my mother. He said I was denying her the chance at a better life and that I am entitled and don't know how good I have it compared to what her life was like. As bad as her life is she created the life she is living and chose to leave us behind. \n\nNow that I'm almost 21 she suddenly wants to be a mother again. My dad called me a horrible person and said I was selfish even though I have tried helping him financially despite being a broke college student myself. I have helped him make rent on times he could not and always call him to check on him so it hurts that he would say that when I always tried to help. I don't want any contact with her but my dad and brother are now against me and it feels like I have no one. I don\u2019t really have any other family in the US other than my brother and dad so now I\u2019m all alone with no support and they\u2019re taking her side.

It is not your responsibility. Focus on studying and have a better life", "Your father can't force you to do this. He can't take your phone away or ground you. If anything, it sounds like they're financially dependent on you. So you have more power than you think. If your father and brother disown you, so be it.

Skype was definitely around and free 10 years ago and you'd think that if you loved your kids enough to leave them a better life, you'd want to talk to your kid.

You have no obligation to a parent that abandoned you.", "NTA Tell your dad that if he thinks you're selfish, you'll show him selfish. Tell them you'll help them as much as your mom helped you growing up. Then stop helping him and your brother. Completely - no money, no nothing. Whatever you do, DO NOT help your mom immigrate. As others have mentioned, you would be 100% responsible for her, and would have to pay everything for her if she flakes, and you KNOW she'll flake.", "NTA.

Your brother can do it when he is 21 if he cares that much. Don\u2019t let them guilt you into it because if you sponsor her than you are liable for any government aid she receives For at minimum the next like 10+ years and that\u2019s on the low end if she has a job the whole time.

The citizenship isn't really in your gift anyway, although you can petition for your mother's status when you are twenty-one (which I assume is what they are talking about) when giving out green cards for the relatives of US citizens. And isn't your brother a US citizen?\n\nIgnore your father. He does, by the way, bear quite a bit of the responsibility for your difficult childhood, and I wouldn't be shocked if what you have heard is not the whole story.\n\nDo you have any idea if this is even something your mother wants, or is this all your dad's idea?", "NTA. \n\nIf your mother really wants to become a citizen, she doesn't necessarily need your approval.
