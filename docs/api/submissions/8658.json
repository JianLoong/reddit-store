{"id": 8658, "submission_id": "10oqlb2", "title": "AITA for not wanting to give my estranged mother US citizenship?", "selftext": "I (20F) got into a huge fight with my father and brother about not wanting to complete a petition to U.S. citizenship for my estranged mother whom I have not seen nor spoken to in years. My \"mother\" who had no part in raising me or supporting me financially, abandoned me when I was 8 years old. I was born in the US and am a citizen, but she is not. She lives in Spain, and I don't know much about her life because I have no contact with her. My dad raised me and my brother by himself without any child support, and life was pretty rough in a single parent household. What was so rough about it was that since my dad had to work all the time I had to do a lot of the housework myself and would often get seriously hurt because what 8 year old child should be in charge of making meals. My brother was only 4 when she eft and so I had to watch him a ot and take care of him which should not have been my responsibility as that was not my child and I was a child myself. \n\nWe had a really rough childhood experienced severe poverty I often feared we would end up homeless because my dad could not cover the bills. I have a lot of trauma from growing up poor and in a household where my emotional needs were not met. I've done so much to try and heal and move forward. I'm on track to graduate college in the spring and go on to graduate school so I would say l've done okay. What bothers me is that despite never receiving any support from my mother she now is planning to come \"visit\" in the US and my dad expects me to make her a citizen because I will turn 21 soon. He said I owe her that much because she birthed me but I was never raised by her and so I don't consider her my mother. He said I was denying her the chance at a better life and that I am entitled and don't know how good I have it compared to what her life was like. As bad as her life is she created the life she is living and chose to leave us behind. \n\nNow that I'm almost 21 she suddenly wants to be a mother again. My dad called me a horrible person and said I was selfish even though I have tried helping him financially despite being a broke college student myself. I have helped him make rent on times he could not and always call him to check on him so it hurts that he would say that when I always tried to help. I don't want any contact with her but my dad and brother are now against me and it feels like I have no one. I don\u2019t really have any other family in the US other than my brother and dad so now I\u2019m all alone with no support and they\u2019re taking her side.

If you sponsor someone trying to get citizenship.  You have to take financial responsibility for them for many yeats(I think 10). If they have no income.

You will be glad too. With inflation.  80,000USD is what the average family makes in a year", "NTA.  You simply can not afford to sponsor your mother at this time, and you are not obligated to do so.  Your father and brother can sponsor her themselves some day since they feel so strongly about it.  \n\nIMO your dad and brother are very selfish to ask you to sponsor your mother after all you have done for the two of them.\n\nYou *could* change your mind and agree to help her AFTER you finish school, have a secure job, and are no longer helping to support your dad.  But be sure to consult an immigration attorney to learn more about the process before making any commitments.", "NTA. You have no relationship with the person. Apart from the financial implications, what your parents are telling you to do is *immigration fraud*. \n\nStay far, far away from their nonsense.", "NTA tell them she can wait till your brother is 21 and he can be responsible for her then \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Info: Is your father a citizen as even if he was not born here, he's been in the country for at least 21 years, and I don't think a Visa could be extended that long.", "NTA.", "\nNTA\nInfo: has your father ever given you a valid reason as to why he didn't sponsor her...

It is not your responsibility. Focus on studying and have a better life", "Your father can't force you to do this. He can't take your phone away or ground you. If anything, it sounds like they're financially dependent on you. So you have more power than you think. If your father and brother disown you, so be it. The alternative is to reward your mother for abandoning you and to give in to your father who made you become a parent when you were still a child. If your father keeps harassing you about this stop giving him money or tell him you won't help him anymore if he won't stop. NTA", "First, you can't make her a citizen. You can only sponsor her for residency (green card).\n\nSecond, sponsoring her makes you financially responsible for her for the next 10 years: feeding her, paying for all medical care, and everything she needs so that she doesn't cost the US any money. \n\nAre you ready to completely and absolutely support all her needs for 10 years? If not,just say no thanks and let her wait for your brother to sponsor her when HE turns 21.", "NTA.  \"Dad.  I will never sponsor her.  I don't want to loose our relationship.  But will not have you pressure me.  Ever.  She abandoned me.  Because of that.  I lost my childhood.  It has taken a lot to recover.  I will not slide backwards.  I will not sponsor her.  And if you keep pressuring me.  I will go low contact with you.  That is how strongly I feel about it.\"   \n    \nInvest your time.  Your energy.  In making friends.  In building your family.  One that will love you.  Not leech off of you.", "NTA. It\u2019s hard going against your only family. But sometimes we have to create our own family, a family we choose and they will be our support. We know it will not be easy to tell your father and brother you cannot sponsor your incubator. You would definitely strangle yourself with that heavy financial weight and you just cannot do it. If that means they don\u2019t want to continue contact with you, you will understand but you will no longer support them either. You choose to move forward.", "In addition, OP has to show he can support his mother.  Here is the financial requirement:\n\n\"You\u2019ll need to show sufficient income or assets to support your parents at 125% of the U.S. poverty guidelines (in addition to supporting your own family). If your parents can\u2019t support themselves, this measure helps to ensure that they won\u2019t depend on government assistance.\" \n\nI wouldn't do it either.  Not just because of the financial piece but also because he doesn't know if his mother can pass the criminal, medical and immigration background checks or even what her current health status is or what kind of person she is.  OP may be inviting a whole lot of trouble for himself which is no way to start your life after graduating from college. \n\nOP, congratulations on succeeding in spite of your circumstances.

Not the same thing!", "NTA, tell her to f off, and also wth is wrong with your dad and your brother, that woman sounds manipulative, set your boundaries and stick to them, and if the others don't respect it, it's time to cut some people off your life, what makes others family isn't blood but feelings ans actions, go look for youw own family who appreciates you.", "NTA. She doesn't want to be your mother again. She just wants citizenship. Your father is wrong. You owe her nothing. You didn't ask to be born. She owed you a childhood which she didn't provide. Tell your dad, if he wants her to be a citizen so badly, he can sponsor her.", "Do not. If you sponsor her, that makes you legally liable to repay the government if she qualifies for any public assistance. She sure has some audacity. NTA", "NTA. If they're that keen then your dad can do it or your brother when old enough.\n\nI would very much doubt you completing a form would 'make her a citizen' just like that anyway, I'd imagine it could still get declined, but americans can weigh in on that one.", "I'm sorry, did i read this right? She lives in spain but wants to go to the usa for a better life? In what world is living in the usa right now a better life?!  She's getting older and thinks oeh let's live somewhere where medical bills will bankrupt me! Something else is going on because the whole living the dream in the usa, is dead", "Nope, you don't owe her shit. Don't do it because then the same arguments your dad is giving you now about her citizenship will be you have to let her live with you, you have to take her to job interviews, you have to take care of her when she's sick, etc etc etc. Don't do it. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m gonna guess she and your dad will expect you to foot the bill for her citizenship, which is not cheap. \n\nDon\u2019t do it. If you give them an inch, they\u2019ll take a mile. This would be worth going LC or NC with your dad and brother over, if they keep taking her side.\n\nTell them if she sends you the equivalent of 10 years of back child support for you and 14 for your brother, you might do it. She never will, because she just wants to use you.", "What I was thinking. Spain isn\u2019t a poor country. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "*SHE* OP is a she.", "You are right.

In Spain there's free universal healthcare, a guaranteed minimum wage and unemployment benefits that are easier to access than in the US.\n\nI think the US is a great country in many ways, but I wouldn't want to be poor there.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, you would be legally responsible for her financially if you sponsored her.  So, if she took government aid or ran up hospital bills, you could be charged for those expenses.  Don't do it.\n\nIf it's so important to your Dad, he could figure out how to sponsor her, himself.", "OP's brother can sponsor her when he becomes eligible to.  NTA", "Yeah, plus she lives in Spain, the hell they mean \"come to the US for a better life\" It's Spain not a 3rd world country, how the hell is emigrating to the US a better life? Especially when you're in your 60s? How is moving to the US where absolute basic health care is more than many can afford an improvement?", "This. Your brother should do it when he turns 21.", "Yeah is dad still hopelessly in love with mom? Have they been in constant contact this whole time? Was this one of those I can make more money in another country, but can't afford to bring the whole family? But then why has OP had zero relationship with mom???\n\nI can get the younger brother wanting the mom he never had, but I don't understand how dad can be so OK with all of this with the context we've been given.", "I thought this too at first except that there's been no contact between OP and the mom in all this. Skype was definitely around and free 10 years ago and you'd think that if you loved your kids enough to leave them a better life, you'd want to talk to your kid. Even if she didn't have any electronics (but really in this day and age in Spain?), she could've written letters. International letters cost $1.45 to send right now, I imagine they were even cheaper before.", "u/Glum_Warning3809 If you're a broke college student this hopefully solves your problem. \n\nLet it sit for a couple days so it seems like you're thinking it over and then slow drip them, even if you don't mean it. \"I've thought about it, I'll do some research.\" Wait a couple weeks and then, \"Based on this info, I don't think it'll get approved.\" Do a little more research so you have more reasons why it won't work, but present it in a less \"I researched so I wouldn't have to sponsor her\" kind of way. \n\nMost larger universities in the US have a student run legal aid office and they might be able to help point you in the right direction.\n\nOpenly standing by your principles is great and all, but if you wanna maintain relationships with your dad and brother.....\n\nBut also if you don't want to do this, she waited ten years to come back into your lives, she can wait 4 or 5 more for your brother to turn 21. NTA", "Welp, I think it certainly could be the case.  She deserves to know whatever the law is in her case.\n\nI don't think she should have any qualms about saying no.", "Nope, that\u2019s not how that works. You can petition for them to come here but that does not grant them any legal status whatsoever, they\u2019ll need to file the petition to have someone SPONSOR them and then they can apply to become a lawful permanent resident ( green card) and then after 5 years of being in the us and not doing anything heinous she can apply to naturalize"]}
