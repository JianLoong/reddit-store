They deserve more than a \"pissed off\" atmosphere. \n\nI wish people would look for the joy more often than they look for the anger.", "INFO: how exactly did your brother \"take the limelight\" here? Was there a flash mob? Did he hire a plane to fly by your wife's window pulling a banner?\n\nIf it was \"hey, we're expecting!\" to you and your parents, YTA. That in no way is lessening the joy of your son's birth, and it's actually sweet - the excitement of seeing what you will be experiencing relatively soon.\n\nAlso your wee fella has no clue his limelight was stolen. It's just you getting your nose outta joint.", "INFO:\n\n>decided to announce to us\n\nDo you mean that they chose to tell you and your wife privately? Or that relatives were there to see your baby, and they took over and made a huge \"we have an announcement\" speech?\n\nBecause I can see how the latter would be a bit annoying. If it's the former, you're kind of ridiculous.", "Based on this sub, pregnancy announcements are becoming the new social minefield!! I need a manual on this in case I'm ever pregnant again.\n\nRegarding the post, I'd say YTA, just be happy for them. They probably thought it made sense to share that news then and there, when you're all surrounded by babies, and it's easy to bring up that topic.", "One of the best advice I ever got was you can\u2019t control what people say or do, you can only control your reaction. Was it the most tactful thing to do? Probably not but I wouldn\u2019t get all worked up about it. NAH.", "I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nThey've probably gotten excited and announced it. I highly doubt it would have been said to intentionally steal the limelight from you & your family.\n\nHowever, I also completely understand why you're annoyed with the situation as the timing could have been better.\n\nEnjoy your time with your newborn son, babies change and grow so quickly and then enjoy the times your son will have with his little cousin as they get older.\n\nDon't let resentment and annoyance ruin your joy.", "NTA, same situation as not getting engaged at a wedding, it\u2019s tacky and rude. Everyone wants to be excited for them but let the other people have their day", "YTA. Why am I seeing so many posts about people getting angry because someone \"stole their thunder\"? Are people so insecure that they cannot just be happy for the person making an announcement? I seriously don't understand it. Yes, there are situations where making an announcement would be inappropriate (don't announce your pregnancy/engagement/impending death at your sister's wedding, for instance) but really ... Your brother and his GF told you and your parents about their pregnancy. That does not diminish the arrival of your son. \n\nJust be happy for them and don't be so snarky. It's unbecoming.", "NTA - it\u2019s like announcing your engagement at someone else\u2019s wedding. \n\nYour brothers announcement is a bit \u201cyou have one, I\u2019m getting one too so yours isn\u2019t that special\u201d\n\nThey did a very tacky thing", "YTA. they were excited and wanted to share", "NAH.  You are not an asshole for being annoyed, this is pretty similar to someone announcing their engagement at someone else's wedding.  It's tacky.\n\nBut it's best to just let it go.", "There are so many of these posts and they are so baffling to me. Literally every one of the 8 billion people on the planet were born on some random day. I get it\u2019s a big deal and I\u2019m happy for you and your wife but how could you possible care about this? Does it make your child any less born?", "YTA. I promise the wee fella is entirely unbothered by this.", "Wee fella won\u2019t know any different. It\u2019s you & your partner who got your thunder stolen. Definitely they are the bad guys here but don\u2019t pretend like the baby has any idea whats going on. But don\u2019t worry your baby will be much older than their baby and you can brag about how your baby is walking and talking and reciting the alphabet doing all the things part because you have a Headstart so when they\u2019re doing it it\u2019ll be like yeah OK cool but this baby just did it all first. Also, you can be gracious and pass down baby club if your baby was probably bigger than their and you can brag about how healthy Armenians all the time. Sorry that happened to you Auntie and uncle aren\u2019t very cool. NTA", "YTA.  The didn't take anything away from your family.  And if you can't handle not being the center of attention, parenting is going to be a huge reality check for you.", "YTA.  This is a joyous occasion.  It's a joyous announcement.  Your child doesn't know the difference.\n\nAccept the news gracefully, and hug and kiss your newborn. He made it safely into this world and not every one does.", "I\u2019m gonna say YTA, because the limelight wasn\u2019t necessarily taken. Your baby is already here (congrats, BTW). They have a couple months before they reach where you are. Your baby will be the focus for now. Just be happy for them! You have your little guy to focus on at the moment.", "Unless they CLEARLY were out to steal your spotlight, which doesn\u2019t seem the case here, see this for what it is: your brother coming to congratulate you, who also had news he was excited to share with you. Was he supposed to somehow know you didn\u2019t want to hear his good news, that you wanted all the attention on your son today (as well as the day before and the months before that)? YTA. \n\nThere is always more room in your life to celebrate good stuff.", "Yta. Get over it, the world doesn\u2019t resolve around you and your son.", "YTA.  This whole thing where people expect to be the center of attention and everyone else must blend into the wallpaper for their special day is just getting ridiculous.  This was the perfect time for that announcement - the family was all together, your wee fella is getting a cousin, it\u2019s all very sweet.  Except that you had to be a self-absorbed prat over it.", "YTA. They didn't announce it at a shower or even while she was giving birth they announced after the baby was born. This will take zero excitement away of a new baby. How long is someone supposed to wait? It's ok to be excited for more than one thing at a time.", "OP, you might be hormonal. People did not stop celebrating your kid because of this and he is not loved any less.\n\nAlso, why are you not happy for your brother?\n\nI'd be thrilled if my kid had a cousin their age that they can play and grow up with.", "YTA", "YTA, who cares! Your baby was already born, it's pretty hard to claim they're stealing pregnancy thunder.", "i am sure he was so excited for you and also excited for himself and his wife and didn\u2019t think about messing up your child\u2019s birth - I bet he is excited about the cousins being close in age snd being  playmates like the two of you were. He was wanting to share their exciting news with his loved ones.  I don\u2019t know why people always get offended by family members wanting to tell their happy news. You messed up your child\u2019s day by getting upset of a new baby in the family. Good Lord take a chill pill everyone is still excited and loves your baby - I just don\u2019t understand all the jealousy in these announcements", "YTA. Chill out. The world doesn\u2019t stop just because something exciting happened to you. It\u2019s healthier to share joy than to nurse resentment.", "Was the pregnancy difficult or any complications?", "Soft YTA. One of my cousins had been trying to conceive for 2 years when I had my first baby. Her & her husband came to meet the baby once we were home, and they both expressed being happy for us. The next day, she came back over & told me they were expecting. I was so happy for her that I broke into happy tears but scolded her for not telling my the day before so we could\u2019ve celebrated a day earlier. Someone else\u2019s happy news doesn\u2019t have to take away from yours. Babies bring plenty of joy to share. They might\u2019ve just gotten too caught up in the moment & a glimpse into their future to stay quiet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Now that's not a big deal but we throw my sons birthday party the weekend of the 26th (his birthday) so usually falls on that Saturday. She doesn't see her nephews a ton and I have a feeling we will probably have that baby a couple of times for her.\n\nBut they couldn't have announced at any other day? I got pissed off when my cousin who is a known dingbat posted about being pregnant literally on my sons birthday (I had JUST announced his birth and I saw that, so did she and didn't post shit but then turned around for that).

They can be happy for two people at once! When my oldest was born he was the first grandkid, and first great grandkid as well. Everyone was excited. A family member announced their engagement at the hospital while visiting me and I was just so excited. Like it didn\u2019t even occur to me to be jealous or something.
