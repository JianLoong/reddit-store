Are people so insecure that they cannot just be happy for the person making an announcement? I seriously don't understand it. Yes, there are situations where making an announcement would be inappropriate (don't announce your pregnancy/engagement/impending death at your sister's wedding, for instance) but really ... Your brother and his GF told you and your parents about their pregnancy. That does not diminish the arrival of your son. \n\nJust be happy for them and don't be so snarky.

He was wanting to share their exciting news with his loved ones.  I don\u2019t know why people always get offended by family members wanting to tell their happy news.

The next day, she came back over & told me they were expecting. I was so happy for her that I broke into happy tears but scolded her for not telling my the day before so we could\u2019ve celebrated a day earlier.
