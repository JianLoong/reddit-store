Hell, I work a mixture of field and office work these days and often don't wear my wedding ring whenever I got out to work beyond the office, and sometimes in office I take it off as it can occasionally interfere with typing. My wife is the same.\n\nA tattoo is a very reasonable accommodation. Her dismissing your needs here, and especially putting down both you and your father, is a very big red flag.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You have a phobia and dislike wearing rings; you\u2019ve given her reasonable alternatives.  You could also wear it on a chain around your neck, if that would placate her and feel OK to you. If you\u2019re comfortable, you could also offer to wear it for non-working/special occasions.  (NB: my husband also has a job that makes it unsafe for him to wear a ring, so he only wears it when he\u2019s not working, and it doesn\u2019t bother me at all.)", "NTA. I was going to suggest a tattoo but then you suggested the same thing. I don\u2019t know why your girlfriend has a problem with it. My father never wore a ring either. My mom said that was common practice back then. My dad grew up on a farm as well and guys just didn\u2019t wear jewelry. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re being sneaky about it", "NTA\n\n> I hate things on my hands\n\nBeginning and end of this, right there, as far as I'm concerned.\n\nAnyone who cares *strongly* about public-proof-via-jewellery is **getting married for the wrong reasons**.", "NTA !\n\nI have friends who are machinists, and they save their rings for \"special occasions\".\n\nA couple do wear the silicone rings, and feel ok about them. They tell me that the silicone is soft enough that anything strong enough to damage their hands would tear the silicone off first, so getting \"caught\" isn't an issue. If that helps your mind a little...\n\nRings do take getting used to if you've never worn one. If you wanted to try silicone again, you could get one that's actually your size, to see if you could adjust to it.\n\nBut your GFs *insistence* that you *must* wear your ring *for her comfort* is off-putting. You have a reasonable concern, you have offered a compromise, but she doesn't seem to care what you think. It may SEEM like a small thing, but she's being irrational about it.", "NTA, alternative offered and refused, the only acceptable option for her is for you to wear something you would hate. Someone needs to get over something but I don\u2019t feel its you.", "NTA my husband is same , not a phobia but a hazard due to his job, he offered to get a tattoo as well but I don\u2019t care if he doesn\u2019t wear one I trust him 100%, Wearing one does not automatically make someone faithful so if that\u2019s her concern she needs to get over it", "NTA; many people don't wear them. I (M) work in an office, but still only wear mine when \"dressing up\" like it's fancy jewelry. Many professions have it being dangerous, as you noted.\n\nMy sister was military and had a a similar issue; I can't recommend the tattoo like she did because you already offered that! I will say it's worked for her.", "NTA, although for similar reasons I wear a silicone one and I did get used to it, but thats because I personally wanted to wear one for the symbolism. I'm not suggesting you must keep at trying it obviously. \n\nIf my husband didn't trust me to turn down anyone asking me out because they didn't know I was married that wouldn't work for me.", "NTA\n\nMany people don't wear their wedding ring for many reasons. Having a thing about stuff on your hands is valid, since its about everything and not just something you're feeling because of the wedding ring. (I could see a potential red flag if this only arose at the thought of wearing a wedding ring in public.)\n\nCould you compromise with your partner and wear it as a necklace? \n\nAlso, yeah, there are plenty of people With a wedding ring on that still cheat. It doesn't stop any of that from happening.", "NTA.. My parents haven\u2019t worn their rings in 15 years at least and are just as married as my aunt and uncle who always wear theirs. \nIt\u2019s a comfort thing, and you work with machinery constantly and could get the ring caught on any one of those things at any time.", "Def NTA. My Dad could never wear a ring for the same reason. He didn\u2019t even like wearing a watch and would roll up long sleeve shirts. I know when I was a kid he would wear it for my mom on their wedding anniversary; no idea if that\u2019s still in practice to this day or not. But that\u2019s another idea you could suggest", "NTA. Lots of men don't wear them. Not many due to a phobia but phobias are very valid. The other compromise since she's not wild about the tattoo is you use the rings for the ceremony then put both yours  in a jewelry box and she can put hers there too.\n\nIf she knows she wouldn't cheat if someone hit on her and you know you wouldn't cheat if someone hits on you it's a good compromise. She can wear hers or not when she wants and you don't have to wear yours \u00e0t all.", "NTA. This is a valid concern to have when working with heavy machinery, and having a phobia as well. The rings have become more symbolic and arent completely necessary. Your soon to be fiance sounds more insecure than she does sympathetic to your concerns. What does it matter if people dont identify you as being married when you're out in public? Either she trusts you or she doesn't.  I think an honest conversation regarding her concerns about this needs to be had. This has more to do with her feeling insecure than it does about you having a phobia. Remind her that you not wearing a ring doesnt mean you're not committed or that you love her any less. But she needs to respect your boundaries here.", "NTA - a ring is the common/traditional sign of someone being married, but that doesn't mean it had has to be the case for you and your GF, especially if you have this phobia. You have a valid reason for not wanting to wear one and your GF is being a bit unreasonable. You offered to get a tattoo, a more recent thing couples are doing, and there are other alternatives to wearing a ring on your hand (like maybe on a chain around your neck?)  Do what makes you comfortable OP, relationships are about compromise and your GF/future wife should be more understanding.", "NTA. My husband has a silicone band that he only wears when he wants to. He does so much with is hands and we would both prefer him not to lose a finger.", "NTA especially with the compromise of getting a tattoo because that's hella more of a commitment than marriage! Also it will let everyone know you're married.\n\nI kind of get where your gf is coming from, if my husband refused to wear a ring I can't pretend it wouldn't bother me. But again a tattoo is a great compromise and those tough feelings are HERS to deal with, not yours.\n\nSide note: I just got us silicone rings because I'm insanely pregnant nothing fits me anymore and I can barely feel that it's on. Obviously you had a bad experience and I totally get that but if you actually tried on a ring that was your size you might not have the same negative reaction. You can get silicone rings for $20 so even if you get one and don't like it you're not throwing hundreds of dollars away.", "NTA, but maybe think about wearing it dog-tag-style on a chain around the neck, if that could work for OP?

Tattoo is actually damn good idea too.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a legit phobia and issue, and you've offered an alternative via a tattoo", "NTA. This isn't a new phobia or one specific to wedding rings, and you offered alternatives which she refused. Either she trusts you to tell people you're taken or she doesn't, and if she doesn't trust you, there's no point in even staying together because relationships don't survive without trust. Likewise with her unwillingness to find an alternative  - never stay with someone who is unwilling or unable to compromise.", "NTA! I think the tattoo should be a good compromise! It\u2019s more of a commitment than a ring anyway. Did she not like that idea?", "NTA. I\u2019m older and know a lot of married people who don\u2019t wear wedding rings. You have a good reason for not wanting to wear one. Could you get another piece of jewelry to symbolize your bond?", "NTA.  Perhaps a compromise could help.  I had a boss once who never wore his wedding band on his finger.  He instead put it on a necklace and wore it that way every day.  Maybe a compromise like that might be amenable to you both?", "NTA: I don\u2019t wear my wedding rings either and honestly there isn\u2019t a reason other than I hate cleaning them all the time.

When I was 17 this actually happened to me with my high school class ring. I was fooling around and jumped and held onto the edge of a patio. The ring got caught on the edge and when i let go the ring didnt. Thankfully I didnt loose my finger. My dad worked in construction and my mom's side was full of farmers.  I grew up hearing horror stories about accidents and never thought it would happen to a kid like me.   \nI was started with NAH but you are willing to compromise with a tattoo. You cant hide a tattoo and you cant take it off when the wife isnt looking. only downside is that you would need to get it touched up now and then since it will likely fade and blur as time goes on.", "NTA. Woman here\u2026 I never say my dad wear his. My BIL LOST his less than three weeks after getting married (23 years ago) and hasn\u2019t worn a new one.

It sounds like she just wants to win the argument. Youve given her reasonable alternatives to declare to the world that youre a married man.

Good luck man", "Honestly, this is why I hate the marriage institution so much some time.\n\nYet again another couple arguing over superficial stuff like a ring. \n\nYour love for her is more important than a stupid ring.\n\nNTA. You are not feeling safe wearing a ring and it's totally fair.

It\u2019s not a big deal to me. I think the tattoo idea is very sweet of you to offer because that\u2019s a very painful process to go through.

Personally, I care a whole lot more about him keeping all his appendages than him wearing a ring.

She shouldn't get mad at you for it. \n\nBut also, if you are marrying someone who otherwise is very reasonable (and if she's not, why are you marrying her?), it's very worthwhile discussing why she cares so much, and come up with an action you can do that satisfies her concerns. My wife told me before we got married it was really important to her I wear a wedding ring. I wasn't very opposed, but was curious why, since she otherwise isn't very traditional. And it was because her parents were divorced, but several years before the divorce, they stopped wearing their rings.

I on the other hand only take off my rings when I'm working with something messy or cleaning my rings. It doesn't bother me that he doesn't wear his and I can't see why that would bother someone.
