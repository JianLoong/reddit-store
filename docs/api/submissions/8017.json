Everything is being very new for me and my husband (28m). I am currently 7 months, but I manage to do things at home normally. My husband works many hours a day while I work from home. We recently had a small family event to announce the baby's gender (it's a boy). My friends helped with the decorations while I cooked. My husband and his family are Italian, but I am Brazilian. My food has always been praised, as I know how to season things very well and I make several typical dishes from my country. After the baby's gender was revealed, we all went to eat. All the food was great, my family and my husband's loved it, they all said things like \"I've never tasted anything like that\". The problem is that my BIL is a restaurant chef and everything he tastes he makes remarks about how bad it is and he could do better. And not even that day was different. Everything he tasted he complained, saying \"That's from your country? I don't think i'm going there so\" and \"When the party end i'll teatch you how to cook\" and laughing. His family was laughing too, and that hurted me a lot. I cooked for 4 plus hours with all my love to show them my culture and skills and still heard that. I immediately burst into tears and said \"how can you be such an asshole?\", soon after I went upstairs and locked myself in the room to cry. My husband and some family tried to take me downstairs again, but I put on my headphones and ignored them. A while later I finally opened it and my husband told me that I should have gone back and listened to his brother's apologies, but I don't know if I should have. Now he's on my side but want me to forgive his brother, but i don't want to do this for now. Some friends understood but said i had a bad reaction. So AITA?\n\nPs: English isn't my first lenguage, i'm using a translator.

Keep blame where it belongs.\n\nNTA (added by edit as per the below suggestion)", "NTA at all.\n\nHe was a guest and was incredibly rude. The fact that he's a chef doesn't excuse his bad behavior and the entire family should be ashamed of him instead of laughing at his rudeness.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s not sorry, honestly stay away from him in the future.

Even if he didn\u2019t enjoy the food, comments like that should not be made. Ever.", "NTA. \n\nHe was horrifically mean to you, after you tried showing him your culture. He should\u2019ve treated you better, and your husband\u2019s family should\u2019ve put an end to his comments rather than let him continue.", "NTA Your brother in law was rude and condescending. He deserved to be embarrassed and put in his place for being an insufferable oafish guest in someone else's home during their celebration. Let him stew in it. Maybe he'll think twice before he does it to someone else.", "NTA, he sounds like a jerk (and possibly racist?)", "NTA, at all! Your BIL is clearly arrogant, and also an insecure bully if he feels the need to insult others\u2019 food as a chef himself. I would have been upset too \u2013 very inappropriate of him. You had no obligation to accept an apology for that rude behavior.\n\nAlso, congrats on soon-to-arrive baby boy! \ud83d\udc76", "You are NOT the asshole.", "NTA. Your brother in law was begging for a fight. You didn't even give him one, you just cried and then ducked into headphones... a perfectly reasonable response for a pregnant person who's been understandably upset.\n\nWhether or not you forgive him is up to you. At least he appears to have realized he got it wrong and apologized... I can't tell how much of this was that he was a true jerk from the start and how much was that he could completely not read the room and this was his badly done form of teasing. Not that it necessarily matters, but it might affect your assessment of how likely he is to cause future scenes, and of what kind, and that would all be information I would want to know before deciding whether or not to forgive.", "NTA. If it were me, I would have kicked his ass out. The unabashed rudeness!", "NTA. No one is required to accept an apology. Also, if he does this for every food then he isn't sorry. He genuinely believes this or feels the need to put everyone down. He may say sorry, but he isn't. Stick to your guns OP. \n\nAlso, congratulations! I wish you and the baby the absolute best. He will love your cooking, I'm sure :)", "NTA it's a shame your nasty ill-mannered BiL ruined the party. What a pig. Take care of yourself and your baby.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry that happened -  it sounds like you are a really good cook and spent a lot of time preparing a beautiful meal.  I think that your reaction was on par with the horrible comments that your BIL made.  \n\nHe really owes you an apology but don't be in a rush as this will take some time to heal.  He's probably jealous of how good a cook you are!!", "NTA instead of retreating upstairs you should have kicked him out. Your BIL owes you a huge apology.", "NTA, you decide if you want to hear his apologies. You decide if you want to forgive him. You don't have to but consider hearing him out if he wants to apologize though. Since he's your BIL, you're stuck with him so this is a chance for you to remind him that he being a chef doesn't give him the right to be rude about your cooking.", "NTA - he was a total jerk. IF you want to give him a chance to apologize (and you definitely don't have to) let him know that you'll give him a chance but if you ever hear him insult your or anyone else's food that he'll be asked to leave your home and not return.", "NTA. He made a scene by being extremely rude to you (the host), not you.", "NTA BIL thinks he is a Chef and a Comedian, he is definitely not funny. He was being a complete ass and his family laughing was the cherry on top. Don't feel bad about the way you reacted.", "NTA. Openly insulting someone's food when they've cooked for you is never acceptable and he knew what he was doing was rude and hurtful. I doubt his \"apology\" is anything other than \"I'm sorry you overreacted\" (bonus points if he chalks it up to pregnancy hormones), and even if it is he knew how cruel his behaviour was and did it anyway. You don't need to pretend everything's okay.", "NTA.  If you decide to be INCREDIBLY and unnecessarily kind and forgiving, if you invite him to another event, it should be on the condition that he not offer opinions on any food he doesn\u2019t bring, himself.  One chance more, at most.  Or, \u201cI\u2019m having a party.  You have a choice.  YOU cater it, or you attend as a guest, and are polite and don\u2019t disparage on the food.  No damning with faint praise.  Act like a polite adult\u201d.", "NTA fuck that arrogant asshole", "NTA - I would have politely reminded the BIL if my cooking was \"subpar,\" he could go eat somewhere else because I'm not entertaining his rude ass comments. He needs to get over his conceited self.\n\nI went off on a family member for being rude about my mother's cooking. When you don't offer to help cook or pay for the meal, you get to keep your mouth shut or take that shit somewhere else.\n\nAnd I wouldn't apologize or need an apology from him either. You do that when YOU are ready.", "NTA. BIL was being rude. Take some time and accept his apology when you feel up to it.\n\nGood luck w the new baby soon!", "NTA.", "NTA, at all. There was absolutely no reason for him to make those comments just because the food wasn't up to his standards (which doesn't even matter, by the way). He was just being an ass to be an ass. From the way everyone else praises your cooking, I have no doubt that your food is delicious. And congratulations on your baby boy!", "NTA- he\u2019s definitely TA, it\u2019s bad to do this to anyone but he played with fire doing it to a pregnant woman and got burned. Someone else mentioned it\u2019s probably worth accepting his apology later on when your up-to it for family peace, but you didn\u2019t over react.", "NTA. Your reaction was quite tame compared to my would-have-been screaming and anger. BIL should\u2019ve known better and someone should\u2019ve freaking defend you or told him to stop being rude. Hell, I would\u2019ve had that reaction even if I wasn\u2019t pregnant.", "NTA-BIL was so rude. It bothers me that you were told to go accept his apology right then and there. You needed space and you shouldn't feel bad about that at all!!", "NTA. Your BIL was a dick. You can listen to his apology as and when you want to.", "NTA, your BIL is rude and needs to learn what is appropriate for work and for home. I\u2019m a dermatologist, and when I\u2019m outside of work and people are talking about some MLM aloe Vera products, or other cosmetic moisturisers I think are rubbish, I smile politely unless they ask me for my opinion as a doctor. There\u2019s a time and a place to pull rank because of your job and a baby shower isn\u2019t it. If he\u2019d spotted a massive food poisoning risk and highlighted it, like raw chicken juices dripping into the repast, that would be the only appropriate time to pick apart the cooking.", "NTA - Those kinds of comments are racist and hurtful in the best of circumstances.  It was your party, and you're pregnant, and had every right to react that way.  You didn't cause a scene - BIL did by being a terrible guest.\n\nAdvice though - Listen to the apology, see how sincere it is.  Forgiveness is not the same as going back to the way everything was.  It doesn't mean you have to forget.", "NTA. Your BIL couldn't stand that you were getting so many compliments on the food and he felt he needed to take you down a peg. He's an insecure jerk and felt threatened by your good cooking.", "NTA but you should sit down with BIL and here his apology, then decide whether to accept it or not", "NTA for leaving, but when you're pregnant you definitely should not lock yourself in the room AND block everyone out.

You certainly aren't required to forgive and forget.\n\nPersonally I'd say congratulations to him, because he got his wish I certainly wouldn't be offering him food that I'd prepared, any time soon. I would go out of my way to order in single portions of take out at the next family gathering I had to cook for. Everyone else can have my cooking but him, he can have a burger from the take out joint or whatever.\n\nIf he complains, just blame it on the cultural differences, and repeat what he said about the food as justification for not giving him any.\n\nItalians often put a great level of cultural importance on family, and sharing food with their families.

Whether or not you forgive him is up to you\n\nSomething to remember here. Forgiveness does not mean excusing his behavior, dismissing what he did, or saying \"it doesn't matter\". He still did something wrong, and it will always be wrong. Forgiveness only means you don't continue to punish him for it. Forgiveness isn't automatic, it is a choice you make.

What I have done in a similar situation is listen then expressed that I needed  time to process and would do so.  I'm not the type to just automatically accept an apology or say, \"Oh, it's okay.\"\nThat said, if OP didn't feel like listening, she didn't.  Can't force someone for sure.", "Agree... But again.
