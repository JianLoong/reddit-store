Everything is being very new for me and my husband (28m). I am currently 7 months, but I manage to do things at home normally. My husband works many hours a day while I work from home. We recently had a small family event to announce the baby's gender (it's a boy). My friends helped with the decorations while I cooked. My husband and his family are Italian, but I am Brazilian. My food has always been praised, as I know how to season things very well and I make several typical dishes from my country. After the baby's gender was revealed, we all went to eat. All the food was great, my family and my husband's loved it, they all said things like \"I've never tasted anything like that\". The problem is that my BIL is a restaurant chef and everything he tastes he makes remarks about how bad it is and he could do better. And not even that day was different. Everything he tasted he complained, saying \"That's from your country? I don't think i'm going there so\" and \"When the party end i'll teatch you how to cook\" and laughing. His family was laughing too, and that hurted me a lot. I cooked for 4 plus hours with all my love to show them my culture and skills and still heard that. I immediately burst into tears and said \"how can you be such an asshole?\", soon after I went upstairs and locked myself in the room to cry. My husband and some family tried to take me downstairs again, but I put on my headphones and ignored them. A while later I finally opened it and my husband told me that I should have gone back and listened to his brother's apologies, but I don't know if I should have. Now he's on my side but want me to forgive his brother, but i don't want to do this for now. Some friends understood but said i had a bad reaction. So AITA?\n\nPs: English isn't my first lenguage, i'm using a translator.

Keep blame where it belongs.\n\nNTA (added by edit as per the below suggestion)", "NTA at all.\n\nHe was a guest and was incredibly rude. The fact that he's a chef doesn't excuse his bad behavior and the entire family should be ashamed of him instead of laughing at his rudeness.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s not sorry, honestly stay away from him in the future.

Your BIL is clearly arrogant, and also an insecure bully if he feels the need to insult others\u2019 food as a chef himself. I would have been upset too \u2013 very inappropriate of him. You had no obligation to accept an apology for that rude behavior.\n\nAlso, congrats on soon-to-arrive baby boy! \ud83d\udc76", "You are NOT the asshole.", "NTA. Your brother in law was begging for a fight. You didn't even give him one, you just cried and then ducked into headphones... a perfectly reasonable response for a pregnant person who's been understandably upset.\n\nWhether or not you forgive him is up to you. At least he appears to have realized he got it wrong and apologized... I can't tell how much of this was that he was a true jerk from the start and how much was that he could completely not read the room and this was his badly done form of teasing. Not that it necessarily matters, but it might affect your assessment of how likely he is to cause future scenes, and of what kind, and that would all be information I would want to know before deciding whether or not to forgive.", "NTA. If it were me, I would have kicked his ass out. The unabashed rudeness!", "NTA. No one is required to accept an apology. Also, if he does this for every food then he isn't sorry. He genuinely believes this or feels the need to put everyone down. He may say sorry, but he isn't. Stick to your guns OP. \n\nAlso, congratulations! I wish you and the baby the absolute best. He will love your cooking, I'm sure :)", "NTA it's a shame your nasty ill-mannered BiL ruined the party. What a pig. Take care of yourself and your baby.", "NTA.  I'm so sorry that happened -  it sounds like you are a really good cook and spent a lot of time preparing a beautiful meal.  I think that your reaction was on par with the horrible comments that your BIL made.  \n\nHe really owes you an apology but don't be in a rush as this will take some time to heal.  He's probably jealous of how good a cook you are!!", "NTA instead of retreating upstairs you should have kicked him out. Your BIL owes you a huge apology.", "NTA, you decide if you want to hear his apologies. You decide if you want to forgive him. You don't have to but consider hearing him out if he wants to apologize though. Since he's your BIL, you're stuck with him so this is a chance for you to remind him that he being a chef doesn't give him the right to be rude about your cooking.", "NTA - he was a total jerk. IF you want to give him a chance to apologize (and you definitely don't have to) let him know that you'll give him a chance but if you ever hear him insult your or anyone else's food that he'll be asked to leave your home and not return.", "NTA. He made a scene by being extremely rude to you (the host), not you.", "NTA BIL thinks he is a Chef and a Comedian, he is definitely not funny. He was being a complete ass and his family laughing was the cherry on top. Don't feel bad about the way you reacted.", "NTA. Openly insulting someone's food when they've cooked for you is never acceptable and he knew what he was doing was rude and hurtful. I doubt his \"apology\" is anything other than \"I'm sorry you overreacted\" (bonus points if he chalks it up to pregnancy hormones), and even if it is he knew how cruel his behaviour was and did it anyway. You don't need to pretend everything's okay.", "NTA.  If you decide to be INCREDIBLY and unnecessarily kind and forgiving, if you invite him to another event, it should be on the condition that he not offer opinions on any food he doesn\u2019t bring, himself.  One chance more, at most.  Or, \u201cI\u2019m having a party.  You have a choice.  YOU cater it, or you attend as a guest, and are polite and don\u2019t disparage on the food.  No damning with faint praise.  Act like a polite adult\u201d.", "NTA fuck that arrogant asshole", "NTA - I would have politely reminded the BIL if my cooking was \"subpar,\" he could go eat somewhere else because I'm not entertaining his rude ass comments. He needs to get over his conceited self.\n\nI went off on a family member for being rude about my mother's cooking. When you don't offer to help cook or pay for the meal, you get to keep your mouth shut or take that shit somewhere else.\n\nAnd I wouldn't apologize or need an apology from him either. You do that when YOU are ready.", "NTA. BIL was being rude. Take some time and accept his apology when you feel up to it.\n\nGood luck w the new baby soon!", "NTA.", "NTA, at all. There was absolutely no reason for him to make those comments just because the food wasn't up to his standards (which doesn't even matter, by the way). He was just being an ass to be an ass. From the way everyone else praises your cooking, I have no doubt that your food is delicious. And congratulations on your baby boy!", "NTA- he\u2019s definitely TA, it\u2019s bad to do this to anyone but he played with fire doing it to a pregnant woman and got burned. Someone else mentioned it\u2019s probably worth accepting his apology later on when your up-to it for family peace, but you didn\u2019t over react.", "NTA. Your reaction was quite tame compared to my would-have-been screaming and anger. BIL should\u2019ve known better and someone should\u2019ve freaking defend you or told him to stop being rude. Hell, I would\u2019ve had that reaction even if I wasn\u2019t pregnant.", "NTA-BIL was so rude. It bothers me that you were told to go accept his apology right then and there. You needed space and you shouldn't feel bad about that at all!!", "NTA. Your BIL was a dick. You can listen to his apology as and when you want to.", "NTA, your BIL is rude and needs to learn what is appropriate for work and for home. I\u2019m a dermatologist, and when I\u2019m outside of work and people are talking about some MLM aloe Vera products, or other cosmetic moisturisers I think are rubbish, I smile politely unless they ask me for my opinion as a doctor. There\u2019s a time and a place to pull rank because of your job and a baby shower isn\u2019t it. If he\u2019d spotted a massive food poisoning risk and highlighted it, like raw chicken juices dripping into the repast, that would be the only appropriate time to pick apart the cooking.", "NTA - Those kinds of comments are racist and hurtful in the best of circumstances.  It was your party, and you're pregnant, and had every right to react that way.  You didn't cause a scene - BIL did by being a terrible guest.\n\nAdvice though - Listen to the apology, see how sincere it is.  Forgiveness is not the same as going back to the way everything was.  It doesn't mean you have to forget.", "NTA. Your BIL couldn't stand that you were getting so many compliments on the food and he felt he needed to take you down a peg. He's an insecure jerk and felt threatened by your good cooking.", "NTA but you should sit down with BIL and here his apology, then decide whether to accept it or not", "NTA for leaving, but when you're pregnant you definitely should not lock yourself in the room AND block everyone out.

Like, word for word", "NTA. Forget about being pregnant. Forget about the food being from a different culture. Your BIL is a major AH. After that you aren't required to listen to an apology from him. You certainly aren't required to forgive and forget.\n\nPersonally I'd say congratulations to him, because he got his wish I certainly wouldn't be offering him food that I'd prepared, any time soon. I would go out of my way to order in single portions of take out at the next family gathering I had to cook for. Everyone else can have my cooking but him, he can have a burger from the take out joint or whatever.\n\nIf he complains, just blame it on the cultural differences, and repeat what he said about the food as justification for not giving him any.\n\nItalians often put a great level of cultural importance on family, and sharing food with their families.

You should give him a chance to apologise, but on your terms and in a place where you are comfortable.

Whether or not you forgive him is up to you\n\nSomething to remember here. Forgiveness does not mean excusing his behavior, dismissing what he did, or saying \"it doesn't matter\". He still did something wrong, and it will always be wrong. Forgiveness only means you don't continue to punish him for it. Forgiveness isn't automatic, it is a choice you make.

What I have done in a similar situation is listen then expressed that I needed  time to process and would do so.  I'm not the type to just automatically accept an apology or say, \"Oh, it's okay.\"\nThat said, if OP didn't feel like listening, she didn't.  Can't force someone for sure.", "Agree... But again.

I am saying you can't get if he us by this story", "I think it\u2019s insulting to imply that pregnant women are behaving stupidly by engaging in low risk behavior that no one would have batted an eye at if they weren\u2019t pregnant. \n\nThere are lots of things that pregnant women shouldn\u2019t do for legitimate safety reasons, but implying they shouldn\u2019t lock a door inside their home is infantilizing.", "Ok I never said locking the door was the problem I said locking the door AND blocking them out ( by wearing headphones) was dumb. Which it fucking is. Even with no health issues, locking the door and blocking everyone out is dangerous, what if something had happened to the house?? Or someone in the house??

(on the assumption it's genuine)", "Brother in law is giant asshole, you are not one. I personally would have gotten nasty with him in front of everyone and not let him ruin *my* party, but that's not something everyone can do.", "OP is NTA. BIL is chef for a porta potty.", "NTA. He was SO rude! Also, Brazilian food is delicious!", "NTA   I can't say what I think about your BIL I'll get banned.", "NTA. Your brother in law sounds very insecure. As a chef myself I would never criticise someone else\u2019s cooking like this, and would most likely be asking for tips as is hard to find authenticity if your not from the region yourself. \n\n It\u2019s hard but try to have confidence in your cooking, you know your food is bad ass. Next time tell him if you need a prep cook you will give him a call.", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s jealous that the attention is on your cooking. It\u2019s his one skill he\u2019s proud of and can\u2019t stand to be shown up. That\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m getting. His ego is bruised that the family loves your cooking. He\u2019s just a rude, childish, self cantered man.", "NTA op and congratulations on your baby \ud83d\udc76.", "NTA. BIL is a total knob.", "Your BIL was being very condescending about your food and your country. He should be the one apologizing and if your husband is asking you to apologize to his brother, you need to put your foot down. He came to your house, ate your food, and disrespected you. He attempted several times to humiliate you. You did nothing wrong. NTA. You didn\u2019t create a scene you reacted like a hurt person and you had every right. I hope things get better", "YTA for caring what this YTA BIL says. You went down to his level. You gave him the reaction he wanted. Next time take his plate. Pit it the trash if that's how he feels about it", "Italians and Brazilians. No drama there /s", "NTA. No one asked for his critique. People can be good at cooking and not be a chef. Hell I\u2019d argue that some people who just cook for fun cook better food than actual chefs. And considering everyone else seemed to like your food, I\u2019m sure it tasted great.\n\nJust because your BIL is a restaurant chef doesn\u2019t mean he gets to tell you what\u2019s good and what\u2019s not. Frankly, he might not be experienced with Brazilian food", "Sounds like my older brother. NTA! He\u2019s the AH. Chin up sweetheart maybe tell your husband that you need less stress and after the baby is born you will speak to your BIL.", "NTA, is this guy really a chef? Or is he just a line cook?", "NTA. It may be his way of joking but he\u2019s literally insulting you", "NTA. BIL is mean. You don't go into someone else's house and insult their cooking. He also sounds like a bigot.", "NTA. If that had happened to me, there would be no relationship with BIL.", "NTA. You sound like a sweet person, who has married into an insensitive family.\n\nThe BIL is a restaurant chef therefore he will be TA in 99.9% of any situation.", "You didn\u2019t make a scene, your c*** of a BIL did. Whatever made him think that was acceptable behaviour. If you can\u2019t say anything nice, don\u2019t say anything at all. Rather than retreating upstairs, you should\u2019ve just thrown him out. NTA.", "NTA. My favorite restaurant is a Brazilian steak house.  You can tell that Brazil is a country that seriously loves food. Who can hate on that? He is a racist.", "The BIL is TA! You are NTA", "NTA. Even  without all the pregnancy hormones playing havoc with emotions, your BIL is the AH", "I have been to some potlucks with some legitimately *bad* food, and I still have never *told the people* I thought that. Terrible manners", "NTA, OP!\n\nI remember my son's godmother once added barbecue sauce to the marinara she was making because she was out of anything else that could remotely work in the dish. Her logic was that barbecue sauce had tomatoes in it.\n\nI bought her a series of recipe cards for her next birthday. They had color pictures, step-by-step instructions and a shopping list. All she had to do was read the cards and do what they told her. She never gave her family food poisoning again.", "The only way I can see it is if was was being sarcastic and it was a joke to actually get her secret recipe. My family jokes like that, but it\u2019s beyond obvious and not the person\u2019s job. Like my mom telling my aunt she could bake a MUCH better cake. My mom culinary skills include instant ramen and frozen pizza, EVERYONE KNOWS this.", "He's probably jealous that everyone loves her cooking, when that's what he normally gets all the attention for.", "It's the unholy unity of the brother's heritage, and being a chef. A lot of chefs, and even kitchen workers, can be stupidly critical of other foods to the point it's not just rude, but absolute ah territory. Add that to the mentioned heritage aholery, and you've cooked up a well done, underseasoned steak of a ah \"BIL\" who thinks he's the Italian Gordon Ramsay.", "Here I was assuming it was the case of those weird Americans who call themselves Italian because their great-grandfather immigrated from Italy at age 7", "[That story is epic](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/o5pzzy/aita_for_calling_my_sil_a_racist_after_she/).", "That's what racist people say to make themselves feel better.", "Damn. Now I\u2019m hungry. I love Brazilian food.", "We ate at one.  I enjoyed everything about it!", "That\u2019s the one!"]}
