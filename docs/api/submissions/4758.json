My parents live about 2 hours from my sisters and an hour from me. (And I am 2.5 hours from my sisters). My mom is supposed to pick up my 3yo Friday and take her to spend the night and then we would drive over Sunday morning early to do celebrations. My sisters intended to drive over Saturday at some point and hang out and spend the night as well and then leave Sunday after dinner when we leave. \n\nSo one of my sisters calls today to say she's pregnant, which is great, but said she is telling us early because she is worried she will be car sick and can't drive to my parents Sunday. Without asking me or discussing it my mom just says it's fine we will all drive up to her. This infuriates me for a ton of reasons and I don't know if that makes me an asshole.\n\nFirst off, I am also pregnant. I am going to tell my family Sunday, but was going to do something cute whatever. But I'm much further along than her and have TWICE driven 2.5 hours to my sisters houses, incredibly nauseated and tired, but in the interests of wanting to keep my pregnancy a secret until Christmas I sucked it up.\n\nI also am incredibly salty at how my sisters needs/wants  are always placed higher than my own. A few years ago when I was SICK and pregnant with 3yo (I lost 30 lbs from nausea and vomiting) we had a trip planned. They decided last minute without me to move the cabin we had initially agreed on to one 2 extra hours away up a winding mountain path. I get car sick regardless, but I was miserable for the entire 12 hour drive. My mom's memory of the trip was that I was \"fine\". Then the second day they made me go on a 3 hour hike when I was miserable and pregnant and having sciatica pain.\n\nI also want to point out I was almost exactly as far along with 3yo in Christmas 2018 and I still had to drive to my parents. Then two weeks later I had to drive and stay for my sisters wedding where I threw up during the rehearsal dinner because I was so ill.\n\nThe issues I have with just going to my sister's are that I now have to take my incredibly active child on a 5 hour round trip on the same day in a car instead of the 1 hour ride home she would have if we kept the initial plan. She also has frequently gotten car sick when driving to my sister's. I am also pregnant and not feeling great and don't want to drive 5 hours round trip for the 3rd time in 2 months. My mom also wants us together all day on Sunday, but realistically with a 5 hour trip we will not be able to spend a ton of time together before we have to leave to get 3yo in bed at a regular time. To top it off my husband and I both have to work Monday so it's not like we can stay late or stay over.\n\nMy mom says I'm being difficult and selfish and I need to just suck it up and go to my sisters. I'm at the point where I almost don't even want to go. Am I being an incredible asshole here for not being empathetic about my pregnant sister?", "created_utc": 1671068860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm8tcd/aita_for_not_changing_plans_for_pregnant_sister/", "score": 1033, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\n>At some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\n>The boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\n>The boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\n>Ballast!\n\n>And the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\n\n>A born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\n\n>When you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\n>Now you and your DH (dear husband) get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.\n\n>While a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\n>So the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady?

I'm the scapegoat in my family and woke up when I watched my parents ignore the needs of my child in order to cater to the whims of my adult brother- the golden child.  I suddenly realized all of the times my parents had placed my brother's whims above my wellbeing. I was also pregnant as I came to this realization and worked through the emotions that came with it.  In the end,  I decided to put my foot down and NOT allow my child to be hurt physically or emotionally by the golden child/scapegoat child dynamic that my parents had created. My husband listened to me and supported me in every way.  We decided to withdraw our child from any and every situation where he may be hurt. I then confronted my mom.  She denied everything until I listed instance after instance where they had treated my poorly compared to my brother from childhood until present and THEN listed when they had done it to my child.  And I was done.  Get counseling, change your ways,  or say goodbye to my family. Because I will NOT allow you to continue hurting my child as you have hurt me. \n\nIn my case,  my parents DID go to counseling and change their ways.  But I don't know of any other scapegoats who got that result. Including my husband with his mom.  He walked away to protect our family.  He did that before I even realized I was the scapegoat in my family, so they KNEW it wasn't an empty threat to be done with them.  \n\nNot gonna lie - it was very hard to confront my mom.  But I love my kids and just cannot watch them suffer. Your child will physically suffer if you choose to appease your mom and make that trip.  All because your mom is placing the whim of her golden child above the wellbeing of her supposedly beloved toddler grandchild. No. Don't allow it.  Be done.

Whatever it is, this situation sucks, but it's on you to tell them no.", "This will never change. You need to really think about what YOU want from your relationships with your biofamily. It sucks but you deserve to be happy too, you deserve to be a first thought.", "It's okay to do things that don't please everyone in your family when you know they are best. Your child comes before your mother and she knows it, she's just pushing because she thinks she can. I'm sorry you are dealing with this.", "Obviously I don't know all the particulars of your situation, but I've found that the shitstorm often isn't as bad as feared, and that it gets less and less in subsequent iterations.", "Sorry to hear that. I would go NC with them. The way they treat you is wrong. Your children will see it as they get older and it could affect how they deal with people in the future. For their sake move on without your mom and sisters.", "You say simply this. I am only available for the original plan. If that doesn\u2019t work then I will be staying home. I am not available to do that much driving given the issue with your child, and if you wanted to also disclose your own pregnancy you could.", "I think try and make boundaries things that you will or will not do rather than hinging on what your family will agree to. So a reasonable example boundary is \"I will not do 5 hours of travel time on Christmas because it will be detrimental for me and my child as we both get car sick. You are welcome to come to mine or if the festivities are at 'closer location' we will attend.\". But your boundary can't be \"you will come to me\" because you're not in control of their actions? You can hold your boundary of not travelling long car journeys by just not getting in a car! \n\nIf you need it, you have permission to just have Christmas at home without seeing anyone from your family. Much love.", "You seem to be a person who is easily guilted and coerced into falling in with family plans instead of having a backbone to put your daughter first and yourself, it looks like you will allow your 3 year old to get carsick instead of letting your family down. YTA if you put your carsick daughter through a 5 hour drive (one way) because you don't want to disappoint FaMiLy and accept that your wants and needs will never be a priority with your family.", "OP, it\u2019s time to embrace being \u201cthe difficult person\u201d or \u201cselfish\u201d or whatever ridiculous names they throw at you.

You deserve some empathy and consideration!  Stay home and celebrate with the people who really care about you.

I have those and the glasses on the way from Amazon lol", "Apologies, you are right, I assumed she was referring to this upcoming Sunday.", "We Canadians are too. Five hours doesn't register to me as a particularly long trip to go see family. I don't think OP ought to go with all of her context but in general I just sort of shrug at five hours.", "NTA. You are an adult. You don\u2019t have to go along with their shenanigans. Stay home, enjoy a stress free holiday.\n\nMy mom pulls this crap. My sisters dictate holidays. I\u2019m never asked what works for me. So I make my own holiday plans now with my immediate family. If whatever they plan works with what I have going on, I\u2019ll go. If not we don\u2019t, simple as that.", "NTA.  It sounds like it is time to start a new Christmas tradition for your family.  Stay home, celebrate, and if they want to see you then they can.  You can do an announcement now about your own pregnancy and let everyone know that is why you will stay home this year due to your own nausea.  After that, you can casually drop how wonderful it was to just spend the time with you husband and child and going forward this is the new tradition for you all.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA- go pick up your child & don\u2019t go. Do something small at home.", "NTA. Honestly, I would just stay home. 5 hours is too much car time when you and your little kid get car sick. That sounds horrible.", "NTA. Say no. Your mom has a choice to make. Christmas with your sister or Christmas with you and your grandkid who has already been born.", "NTA.  Honestly I'd back out completely and stay home with my immediate family.  I would though tell them why- that you'd been planning on suprising everyone with a pregnancy announcement too, but since they didn't even CONSULT you on the change in plans, happy fcking holidays to them and you won't be driving 5 hours in one day with a 3 year-old on top of everything else.   NTA at all and I'm sorry OP.", "Boundaries need to be set. \nYou need to for your sanity.\nWhat you do shows your children what is acceptable,  example: the other family members can walk all over you. So the kids can too. And they will pick that up and run with it. Shut down the family's entitlements,  and choose to be in charge of your life.", "ESH - it sounds like they are always more accommodating to her, which gets annoying I know, but you're also mad at them for not catering to your situation either...which you haven't told them about.  You can't get mad at them for not considering information you have kept from them.", "NTA but... you never asked anyone to make accommodations for you. Your sister asked and people are overall agreeable to these kinds of things. You can't expect that others will anticipate your discomforts when you don't say anything.", "INFO:\nAre you saying they don't know you're pregnant? That it's still secret?", "Tell her no and that u will be at your parents on Sunday. Talk to your parents.

So I guess technically it's does she want to do Christmas with two daughters and two grandchildren or with just me.", "I did end up telling them and the solution for them was that they will still travel to my sister and I can just stay home so it's clear now where I stand. Just sucks to feel this way with family.", "I did end up saying something today and the resolution was that they will not change the new plans and I can just stay home so \ud83d\ude44 My husband pointed out that if I had announced first and made the same request I would have been called difficult then too so it's a lose/lose and better off for us to just stay home.", "It was until this morning. My mom started just stating the new plans and I said look I'm not driving to my sister's. I've done it twice in the past few months and I've gotten sick both times, and I'm pregnant too. And that it's too much to ask me to do that when the initial plan was a much shorter trip.\n\nThe solution was that they will still go to her and I can just stay home so, at the very least it's been made extra clear to me where I lie on the importance totem pole", "That'd be a bit useless because my mom is the one insisting we move it to my sisters, so they won't be at their place either.", "Read Glennon Doyle\u2019s Untamed and Nedra Tawaab\u2019s Set Boundaries, Find Peace. Great starters for boundaries and self care. Boundaries are set by you, for you, not to control others. Good luck. Total shitty situation. I would honestly not go, and plan something sweet with your husband and kid.", ">Please read the book \"Codependent No More\" because your need to please smacks of Codependency.\n\nThis was the first thing I thought of. \n\nI don't see OP saying she tried cancelling activities when she wasn't feeling up to it in the past. She talks about traveling long distances with car sickness; she doesn't say \"I declined the invitation\". She talks about going on an excruciating hike when she was pregnant and not feeling well; I don't hear her say \"I told them I wasn't feeling up to it and would stay back.\" \n\nCodependency makes you feel like you're obligated to do things just to keep others happy. It makes you feel like stating your own needs and caring for your own well-being isn't an option without pissing off other people. OP felt obligated to tag along on the hike and drive to the cabin a long distance away. OP was willing to suffer through those past episodes rather than sticking up for herself, and now is annoyed that sister is being treated better -- when it sounds like sister DID state what accommodation she'd need. \n\nI understand why OP feels the way she does, but having been through codependency myself, now that I'm (mostly) on the other side of it, I can also see that OP likely has some trouble advocating for herself in the first place -- and nobody else is going to care for her needs properly if she can't state what those needs are.", "They know from past experience that if they berate or nag you, they'll get their way. Teach them otherwise by clearly stating your needs and then not giving in. They'll catch on eventually.", "I apologize. I misunderstood. \n\nI have a roughy relationship with my mom, so Christmas without her is not a bad thing for me. But then I suggest asking yourself what will make you happier: driving further or having Christmas at home with your husband. You can always share the baby news over a video call.", "Oh gotcha. I\u2019m so sorry!! :(", "> You have a little girl and you as her mother are her primary teacher and she will learn about life not just from what you say but what you do.\n\nThis part, right here. \n\nMy mom was a life-long people pleaser from a manipulative family, and very often gave in to \"make things easier\", only to be resentful and emotionally injured later on. She would do way too much, and then be resentful of everyone for expecting so much from her and draining her dry. But she never said no. \n\nGuess who learned all those terrible life skills from her mom, who has now gone through her own extensive therapy to try to learn how to actually be happy and care for her own needs: \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Op I hope to see this on best of Reddit and see that you didn\u2019t go.

Once the shock and excitement wore off the new plan was that they would still travel to my sisters and I can just stay home so, guess that's been decided. I definitely will be much more aware of how much I bend for my family since it's obviously clear I will never be a priority to them.", "You set boundaries by staying whatever it is doesn\u2019t work for you and offer compromises that you are comfortable with (if you even have any concessions to offer).

It\u2019s hard, I get it, but at some point you have to be brave enough to say no and then not show up at their command. They are always going to try to stomp. You can\u2019t control them. You can control you.", "At this point i would just shoot them all a text letting them know your preggo and decided to stay home\n\nIf they give you sh1t you can give above reason they gave for sister as you are much farther along than sister\n\nAnd if they still give you crap just ignkre them at this point because there is nothing you can do\n\nAnd plan a nice night with the fam", "Right?\n\nIt's so painful watching people pretzel themselves on the alter of 'Family' and crappy holidays.", "Yep, here in Australia, dad and I are doing a 16 hour trip one way for christmas.

Because if you wait and your sister does it first you will be accused of trying to upstage her.", "Yes, OP, try \"I'm more pregnant and more sick so actually you all need to come to me\"\nNTA", "I'm rolling my eyes about how OP keeps saying how her family \"makes\" her do things. Grow a backbone OP and stop being such a whiny victim.", "And if they refuse to negotiate, then don\u2019t go.", "NTA, but it's time to grow a spine and say you will not go because you're also pregnant and have history with being car sick.
