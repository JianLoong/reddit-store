My parents live about 2 hours from my sisters and an hour from me. (And I am 2.5 hours from my sisters). My mom is supposed to pick up my 3yo Friday and take her to spend the night and then we would drive over Sunday morning early to do celebrations. My sisters intended to drive over Saturday at some point and hang out and spend the night as well and then leave Sunday after dinner when we leave. \n\nSo one of my sisters calls today to say she's pregnant, which is great, but said she is telling us early because she is worried she will be car sick and can't drive to my parents Sunday. Without asking me or discussing it my mom just says it's fine we will all drive up to her. This infuriates me for a ton of reasons and I don't know if that makes me an asshole.\n\nFirst off, I am also pregnant. I am going to tell my family Sunday, but was going to do something cute whatever. But I'm much further along than her and have TWICE driven 2.5 hours to my sisters houses, incredibly nauseated and tired, but in the interests of wanting to keep my pregnancy a secret until Christmas I sucked it up.\n\nI also am incredibly salty at how my sisters needs/wants  are always placed higher than my own. A few years ago when I was SICK and pregnant with 3yo (I lost 30 lbs from nausea and vomiting) we had a trip planned. They decided last minute without me to move the cabin we had initially agreed on to one 2 extra hours away up a winding mountain path. I get car sick regardless, but I was miserable for the entire 12 hour drive. My mom's memory of the trip was that I was \"fine\". Then the second day they made me go on a 3 hour hike when I was miserable and pregnant and having sciatica pain.\n\nI also want to point out I was almost exactly as far along with 3yo in Christmas 2018 and I still had to drive to my parents. Then two weeks later I had to drive and stay for my sisters wedding where I threw up during the rehearsal dinner because I was so ill.\n\nThe issues I have with just going to my sister's are that I now have to take my incredibly active child on a 5 hour round trip on the same day in a car instead of the 1 hour ride home she would have if we kept the initial plan. She also has frequently gotten car sick when driving to my sister's. I am also pregnant and not feeling great and don't want to drive 5 hours round trip for the 3rd time in 2 months. My mom also wants us together all day on Sunday, but realistically with a 5 hour trip we will not be able to spend a ton of time together before we have to leave to get 3yo in bed at a regular time. To top it off my husband and I both have to work Monday so it's not like we can stay late or stay over.\n\nMy mom says I'm being difficult and selfish and I need to just suck it up and go to my sisters. I'm at the point where I almost don't even want to go. Am I being an incredible asshole here for not being empathetic about my pregnant sister?", "created_utc": 1671068860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm8tcd/aita_for_not_changing_plans_for_pregnant_sister/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if not, then you have a family of your own to worry about.", "Hmm sounds tough \u2026 what would make sense for everyone considering everyone has things they have to work around? Is there a happy middle ground?", "Because she asked.", "Yeah I totally understand that they can't read my mind about being pregnant but asking me to keep my 3yo in the car for 5 hours while she gets car sick and I get car sick just to appease my one sister and to change all the plans around because she \"might be nauseous\" is driving me crazy. I don't know how to set and hold the boundary when requests that I make are stomped on.", "I feel the only competitive part is that I'm comparing my past treatment as a pregnant person to the way she is being treated. I can call and tell her but I know she will insist she can't drive. She offered to just not go and my mom wouldn't accept that and instead just volunteered that all the plans should change.", "I'm just so tired of conflict that I fold a lot. And I am so tired of being labeled the difficult one and then being difficult in their eyes and they are like \"see\", so it sucks a lot. I do definitely need to hold boundaries better, it's just so difficult to do when you're used to being stomped on", "I don't know. The middle ground is quite literally and geographically my house and I never mind hosting but my sister would still claim she can't drive that far. To my mom and sisters the middle ground is that it's moved to my sisters house and I go there, no exceptions. If I tell my family I'm pregnant and don't want to drive that long they will absolutely not take my consideration over my sisters. I really don't know what to do because I'm so tired of bending over backwards and being disregarded but I also hate being labeled the difficult one and standing up for myself too because it's so difficult", "When I asked in the past we never made any changes though and I was just expected to suck it up. I think if it was an isolated thing I wouldn't be so upset by it but I literally went through this with my first pregnancy and was told to deal.", "Confront them with it. You are their daughter if they give a shit about you and value you they will try to make it work. Just tell them about pregnancy, you getting carsick because of it and your toddler too. If they still insist on you driving there I guess you need to fall into the house with the front door (Why they would expect you and your family to take all these boundaries on you to get there just because they don't want to be flexible as they are with switching the locations towards your sister. If all strings burn it's time to get some distance between your family and all of them, for the sake of you, husband and daughter. Nobody wants a toxic family which doesn't give a FCK about their not favourite kids.", "Just play the same record back.. but you don't have to do your big reveal yet.. just say you can't drive to sisters or you can't be there.  Let mom then make the call after that. If she refuses to change her mind then you can make a decision after that.. and now you've kept your pregancy secret for so long.. maybe the better way to surprise is later with the baby NTA", "Just remembered they are the difficult ones for not respecting your boundaries. Respecting someone boundaries is not hard.", "Own being the \"difficult\" one.  That is their label, not yours. So, then that makes it their problem, not yours.\n\nThat places the issue back on them.  And you can just shrug them off as they push back.\n\nOWN that boundary and let them squirm.", "Yeah \u2026 unfortunately, with family and that far of distances, someone is going to be put out. Just be grateful that you\u2019re able to spend time together and be the bigger person (it\u2019s annoying for sure). But, it is what it is, right? It\u2019s only a few times a year. Next year, offer to host as early as possible!", "Ok, so the problem isn\u2019t that you don\u2019t want to accommodate your sister, it\u2019s that you wish they had been equally considerate with you.", "I always offer to host but they complain about having to drive to my house too. There's just no good answer other than me bending over again and that could result in me being sick, my daughter being sick, and huge amounts of stress day of which is like, not great when you're pregnant", "Essentially. And I know it's a bit fortune teller of me but if the roles were reversed there's no fucking way they'd all pivot and come to my house. My house is a shorter drive for my sisters and my parents, but they complain every time they have to drive here.", "Maybe next year say \u201cI am going to host at my house and would love for you all to come. If you are unable to make it, I completely understand, but I want to stay at my place for the holidays. Next year, we can rotate - that\u2019s only fair.\u201d Or, have a convo this time about future holidays since you\u2019ll all have kids. Spread out the driving", "You should tell them about your pregnancy, and ask them not to change the plan for Xmas.", "Yeah I always offer to host and even though I'm in the middle for whatever reason I'm last choice. I hosted Thanksgiving this year because I love to host and had always done it. However the last two years my sisters took turns because they thought they wanted to host but they did NOTHING but open their house and then complained about hating hosting and cooking so now it's back at my house again. However now this means they don't want to do \"two holidays in a row\" here. I put my foot down about not traveling on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day so that's part of why we do it on a different day, which is also seen as difficult."]}
