My parents live about 2 hours from my sisters and an hour from me. (And I am 2.5 hours from my sisters). My mom is supposed to pick up my 3yo Friday and take her to spend the night and then we would drive over Sunday morning early to do celebrations. My sisters intended to drive over Saturday at some point and hang out and spend the night as well and then leave Sunday after dinner when we leave. \n\nSo one of my sisters calls today to say she's pregnant, which is great, but said she is telling us early because she is worried she will be car sick and can't drive to my parents Sunday. Without asking me or discussing it my mom just says it's fine we will all drive up to her. This infuriates me for a ton of reasons and I don't know if that makes me an asshole.\n\nFirst off, I am also pregnant. I am going to tell my family Sunday, but was going to do something cute whatever. But I'm much further along than her and have TWICE driven 2.5 hours to my sisters houses, incredibly nauseated and tired, but in the interests of wanting to keep my pregnancy a secret until Christmas I sucked it up.\n\nI also am incredibly salty at how my sisters needs/wants  are always placed higher than my own. A few years ago when I was SICK and pregnant with 3yo (I lost 30 lbs from nausea and vomiting) we had a trip planned. They decided last minute without me to move the cabin we had initially agreed on to one 2 extra hours away up a winding mountain path. I get car sick regardless, but I was miserable for the entire 12 hour drive. My mom's memory of the trip was that I was \"fine\". Then the second day they made me go on a 3 hour hike when I was miserable and pregnant and having sciatica pain.\n\nI also want to point out I was almost exactly as far along with 3yo in Christmas 2018 and I still had to drive to my parents. Then two weeks later I had to drive and stay for my sisters wedding where I threw up during the rehearsal dinner because I was so ill.\n\nThe issues I have with just going to my sister's are that I now have to take my incredibly active child on a 5 hour round trip on the same day in a car instead of the 1 hour ride home she would have if we kept the initial plan. She also has frequently gotten car sick when driving to my sister's. I am also pregnant and not feeling great and don't want to drive 5 hours round trip for the 3rd time in 2 months. My mom also wants us together all day on Sunday, but realistically with a 5 hour trip we will not be able to spend a ton of time together before we have to leave to get 3yo in bed at a regular time. To top it off my husband and I both have to work Monday so it's not like we can stay late or stay over.\n\nMy mom says I'm being difficult and selfish and I need to just suck it up and go to my sisters. I'm at the point where I almost don't even want to go. Am I being an incredible asshole here for not being empathetic about my pregnant sister?", "created_utc": 1671068860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zm8tcd/aita_for_not_changing_plans_for_pregnant_sister/", "score": 406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.\n\n>At some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.\n\n>The boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.\n\n>The boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?\n\n>Ballast!\n\n>And the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.\n\n>A born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .\n\n>When you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.\n\n>Now you and your DH (dear husband) get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.\n\n>While a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!\n\n>So the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady?

She wanted me to clear out the loft and garage. I said that was impossible, as she knew I couldn't walk even with a cane. Hubby would drive me down, he would clear stuff and I could stand, or sit and wrap and pack it into boxes and he would drop donations off too. She kept insisting I drive down alone and to borrow my husband's company car. (Not legal.) She told friends and family I had refused to help her and I got calls about how I could be so cruel. She never mentioned that her conditions made all help impossible to fulfill. I learnt after that just to say no, as it leads to far less drama and family going to hear the wrong story anyway. You have to do what is best for you. (The happy ending for me was I moved house too and my new doctor realised at once what was wrong with me and I got meds and learnt to walk again!)", "NTA there is no point to discuss tbh. Just tell them your family wont be joining. That you and your partner and child are having xmas at your home on the 25th and if they cant come to let you know so you can make less. Your family is them is you partner and child, you are the head of your family - everyone else now takes second place.\n\nDont bother arguing or anything. Unless you are upset at not having your mother there - then tell her how far along pregnant you are and that you cant do that journey. Dont make it a comparison, dont say i did that before, this happened before.\n\nYou shouldnt have accepted the further cabin during the trip, nor the 3 hr hike. You shouldnt suck it up constantly. You bring this on  yourself.", " NTA. , and I understand completely. Maybe it\u2019s time to start to start your own holiday traditions. I had to do that with my mother. It was hard there was a lot of push back and guilt. But in the end it was worth it.", "NTA stay home and start new traditions with your smaller family.", "NTA. Here\u2019s what you say: \u201cSorry, all, the new plan doesn\u2019t work out for me, so y\u2019all go ahead and me, DH and kiddo will celebrate at home this year.\u201d\n\nThen do it. Enjoy a peaceful holiday without seething over everyone catering to the golden child. I guarantee you won\u2019t regret it.", "NTA\nJust don't go. Have a great day with your children instead. Maybe text your mom exactly why you are angry with her so she can't spin it differently later. They won't change and it's time to accept it. Keep your distance and be with people that actually care about you.", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t take part in any plans that were changed without taking your needs into consideration", "NTA. You literally do not have to do any of this. You didn't have to go hiking either. So many issues would be solved if people put their foot down and stuck up for themselves.", "NTA but you're an adult. Just don\u2019t go", "Nta. Tell your mother that you wouldn't get to spend the day with them because 5 hours in the car will eat up the entire day. And you don't think that's fair for your three-year-old to spend the majority of her Christmas in a car. Stay home and enjoy the time with your little one, hopefully nausea free.", "NTA.  Just text everyone and say.  Sorry, that won\u2019t work for us.  I\u2019m x number of months pregnant and am once again really struggling with morning sickness on top of my normal car sickness.  When  I drove up for x and y occasions, I got sick both times and don\u2019t want a repeat of that.  I hope everyone has a wonderful holiday and that we can get together after the holidays.", "NTA - why on earth should you put yourself through this? Tell them that this doesn't work for you and your family, your 3yo is not going to be well during the trip and they should understand this. \n\nTell them that, either you keep to the original plan or you and your family will stay at home and celebrate Christmas alone. \n\nDo not feel obliged to tell them about the pregnancy - tell them when it suits YOU\n\nCongratulations on adding to your beautiful family.", "I'd tell them that you are pregnant and their @ssholery ruined the surprise you planned for them and so no, you won't be making the 5 hr round-trip for a one day event to her house and they can stuff it.  \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nAnnounce the pregnancy early and say if she can come as you are farther along. Do not put yourself through this. Your resentment will continue to build. \n\nI hope you are getting some counselling. Set boundaries op!", "NTA. Honestly OP if I were you I just wouldn\u2019t go. They are used to bulldozing you and if you keep letting them, they will keep doing it. If it\u2019s no longer easier to back burner you versus giving in to Golden Child, at the very least they will notice. Congrats on your pregnancy, take care of you and your kiddos!", "You know you can say \"no\" right?", "NTA. Time to start a new family Tradition. It's Happy Holidays you sound anything but. I'd Miss them but I wouldn't miss being car sick and stressed.", "NTA, also you need to start thinking about what sort of behaviour you are modelling for your child, at 3 they are starting to see the world around them - what sort of mother do you want them to see? One that is strong and confident in her boundaries, or one that will capitulate to avoid rocking the boat?", "NTA. Just tell your mom you\"re in the mood to be srlfish and don't feel like sucking it up this year, so you and your family going to skip the Xmas thing. She doesn't need any other explanation and screw her if she gets mad.", "NTA - but stay home.", "NTA. But I would straight up say I am pregnant too and cannot make that drive either. So it's either our parents house or see you next year.", "NTA. I'm mad for you. I highly suggest not going. Your mother changing plans for an event a few days prior for the golden child is just rude. \n\nYou're definitely not being selfish, OP. Your mother should've discussed with the rest of the family attending to see how they felt about it first before collectively deciding for everyone what was going to happen. I'd stay home with my family if I were you, and have your own dinner.", "NTA  I feel like at this point you should stay home with your family and send them all a text with a picture of you guys snuggled up pointing at your belly with some caption  about being pregnant.", "YTA. Just because you don\u2019t communicate your needs and ask for accommodations doesn\u2019t mean your sister is wrong for doing so. Advocate for yourself", "A soft YTA\n\nYour sister has told your family that she's too sick to travel and they have agreed to visit her. You've not told your family about your pregnancy yet so they can't take this into consideration. You can tell them that you don't want to go that far with your 3yo and their travel sickness. You can stay home, you can avoid travelling, avoid your child stuck in the car, avoid their travel sickness and just have a quiet day at home. But you do need to tell your family why... They can't adapt things when you haven't told them that you're pregnant", "Just don\u2019t go. You will be amazed how much more you will enjoy your Christmas at home by yourselves.", "My first pregnancy I developed almost an aversion to ginger stuff because I kept trying to use them to stave off nausea but ended up nauseous anyway and I think my brain is connecting ginger with nausea now lol I tried some ginger pops and \ud83e\udd22\ud83e\udd22 I've been doing unisom and b6 and its helping some but I'm still sensitive to certain foods and the car", "Yeah thats been my rule for Christmas eve and day as well, which is part of why my family has Christmas on a different day", "It\u2019s not Christmas though. OP is already spending Christmas at her house. What she\u2019s missing is her family gathering.", "You\u2019ve made a practice of being accommodating to your family and they\u2019ve gotten to expect it. That\u2019s why your mother is calling you \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cselfish\u201d\u2026not because you are those things (you\u2019re not), but because you\u2019re monkeying with the status quo.\n\nFamily and friends often resist when we try to change our roles, particularly if it inconveniences them. Stand strong\u2026taking care of your own wellbeing doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t care about your mother and sisters, whatever they say to the contrary.", "Learn how to not JADE (justify, argue, defend or explain). You don\u2019t need to provide a list of reasons why something doesn\u2019t work for you. \n\nAnd embrace being \u201cdifficult\u201d. It means you have a spine.", "\u201cSo my family\u2019s Christmas is meant to be this Sunday.\u201d My point is exactly as I stated it. Stay home and enjoy the peace and quiet (ha who are we kidding with a 3yo!) and don\u2019t bother with the family bullshit this year.", "This is the most important thing - you are a mom now. If you think it\u2019s upsetting for them to walk all over you, wait until you watch it happen to your kid. Set boundaries now so your kid isn\u2019t the one expected to always be second to sister\u2019s kids.", "I cannot highlight this enough.  Frankly I think that message needs to go to the entire family.", "The conflict ends when you say no and mean it. You have established a pattern of saying something doesn't work for you then doing whatever they want. They have learned you don't mean it when you say, no!\n\nDon't tell them that the plan doesn't work for you. Tell them what you are willing to do. What this means for this trip is you tell them that you will stick to the original plan or stay home.\n\nSo they complain and say you are difficult, and? Don't engage. Wish them a nice time and enjoy your day like it is the most normal thing in the world.  The main part is not to get sucked into the arguments. \"Maybe next year! This year is decided.\"\n\nIt is normal that families don't spend every holiday together as their own families change and grow.", "Stay home. Five hours in a car with a toddler is too much and definitely no fun for her. I would tell family, Sorry I can't make it this year. Merry Christmas and we'll try to make the next get together.", "Sunday is not even Christmas, why can't they just pick some other arbitrary day to celebrate with OP? I'd also vote staying home this weekend and tell your mom you'll see her some other time.", "This exactly!!!", "No, she shouldn\u2019t confront them..,they\u2019ll just get defensive and attack her. The best way to deal with people like this is to refuse to play the game. Plans that were agreed upon change for no real reason? Fine, I won\u2019t go.", "I\u2019m so tired of that be the bigger person shit.  That\u2019s always said by someone wanting someone else to play complacent victim.", "But those people won\u2019t change by refusing the game. If they start attacking her for confrontation, she knows she should get distance towards them.", "Why do you want to spend your holidays with people that have no respect for you and your needs?"]}
