At the end of the month we have very little income after we pay rent and bills. She gets very restless and wants to go out of the house. Today we got into a huge fight because I was trying to do things that don\u2019t cost money. I offered to go for a walk, but our dog started to eat rocks and she got super mad and we went back home. When we got home I asked if she wanted to do a puzzle and she said no. I asked if she wanted to do a craft I was working on. She said no. So now she\u2019s yelling at me that I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to work from home and how isolating it is. She\u2019s wanting to do out and we can\u2019t afford it. I have barely any gas in the car, and I have 20$ to my name until next Thursday. Am I the asshole for not taking my wife out?\nEdit: I should mention she could be working from the office in the city but prefers to work from home since we only have one car and doesn\u2019t want to take the bus.\n\n\nUpdate: I showed my wife this post. I decided to make her a dinner that could mimic a dinner out. I made a cauliflower pur\u00e9e with roasted broccoli, caramelized carrots and pan seared haddock with a lemon butter sauce. I put candles on the table and when we sat down after I invited her to have dinner with me, she asked what I got from this post. I said perhaps we divid the money each pay so that at the end of the month we aren\u2019t so tight. I thought things were going in a positive direction but she lost it on me and said I should feel justified that I am not the asshole and she is. This post wasn\u2019t for that. I wanted a third party response to help give their opinion. Thank you for all your opinions and tips.

I go stir crazy at home too long.  I think she just needs something to do with you outside.  A picnic in the park or the beach,  find a pond to feed ducks (maybe leave the rock eating dog at home).  Spend some time and see if there are free ( or cheap) community activities.  They used to have movie night out in a park near me, and there\u2019s free band concerts, even a farmers market.", "NTA. Your wife has options for not being so isolated that are fully within her own control. She needs to pick one instead of getting mad at you.", "NTA. Asshole isn\u2019t the right word at all because you\u2019re both living in an extreme circumstance a lot of us can\u2019t truly empathize with. Living paycheck to paycheck is a real burden, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in these circumstances.

I do feel for your wife as I also need to go out at least on the weekends.  You might consider moving to an area where there\u2019s a lot to do outside without breaking the bank?\n\nI live close to a lot of parks, downtown, and also some beaches.  There are things that don\u2019t cost a lof of money like getting ice cream or a drink.\n\nConsider joining a gym.  It would be awesome to include working out as a hobby and you can take fitness classes together.  Some gyms have pools/jacuzzi/sauna.  I think this would help your wife not feeling so isolated. Maybe she could make friends there too.\n\nIf you have a patio, you can also set it up with a table and some lights and music, at least you guys can get some fresh air. \n\nSit down with your wife and see how you can cut expenses in order to afford $30 every now and then to go to the movies.\n\nI know the economy is so f***ed up right now", "Nta, your wife is just a caged animal right now but with your money troubles theres really not much you can do. \n\nOn a side note no offense but ya dog is really dumb.

Your budget is too tight, that causes issues most of the time.", "Could it be possible that your wife wants your attention and needs your love? Why don't you take her on a surprise date, have a picnic in a park, go to a free museum or visit the place you got married.\nFrom my personal experience, working from home is very isolating. I ended up depressed and my marriage suffered. You are her husband, you are supposed to notice that she is lonely and sad. Of course, she should take care of herself too and go out with friends or for a run. But it wouldn't be asked to much if you put in some effort to try make her happy?", "INFO: how would her needing to either pay for a monthly pass for the bus, or pay for per-ride access to the bus improve your monetary situation as a couple? It seems like that would result in even less money at the end of the month if your budget is that tight and her going to the office for her social exposure would make your situation worse.", "NAH", "NAH. Working from home is very isolating. There are plenty of things you can do outside for free though. Going for a walk is a great idea \u2014 why couldn\u2019t you leave your dog home and walk if he can\u2019t behave? I\u2019m confused why you all have to stay inside the house all the time?", "NTA, and sympathetic but firm AH for your wife. Working from home can be very isolating and stressful (especially if you struggle to turn off, having no hard barrier between work and home can absolutely mess with some folks), so I understand her being antsy and upset at being unable to go out and decompress. *However* it's massively unfair of her to take it out on you when you are working a very demanding job full time and are at a point in the month where you're very tight on cash. You offered to do some things with her, she wasn't in the mood for any of them, and was letting her restlessness be a trigger for lashing out. \n\nUltimately it sounds like the end of the month is just going to kinda suck until further notice and if she wants to change that it should be on her to keep a \"getting out of the damn house\" budget, even if it's only enough to go out for a coffee then go straight back home.", "NTA. I don\u2019t go out because I can\u2019t afford it. Would I like to? Yeah sometimes.", "NTA for not taking her out but I think your wife has a valid point about WFH being isolating.  I WFH and last week I had an entire day where the only conversation I had was with Google.  It was glorious. Not everyone feels that way.  I hate to put it this way, but it sounds like a her problem.  She needs to take responsibility for her own mental health and find an outlet within the confines of their budget that will work for her.  While I firmly believe that spouses should support one another in every possible way, you are not her entertainment director.", "NTA but look for other free stuff out of the house.", "Sounds like your wife needs friends.", "Nta, your wife is unreasonable. But of she feels cooped up she just generally be frustrated you should tell her to try working hybrid she will get the best of both worlds.  And maybe feel less lonely", "     Nta, if you working from home is making you depressed then start looking for another job. As long as you are actually trying to hang out with her. \n    But you are her partner so it is part of your responsibility to help her out of this slump. This is most likely poor communicating, you can talk all the time and still not be communicating. You guys need to have a real discussion. Make a fun budget it is a necessity. Do this together, you guys are a partnership you need to do budgets together anyway. \n    You didn\u2019t mention any kids so realistically she shouldn\u2019t need to always be home. If she\u2019s only working 4 days from home. She could get a part time job, even only working 2 days a week could be very beneficial for her mental health. She could try to work at an animal shelter or something like that. And it would get you guys a little extra money. \n    Now let\u2019s not forget about you, I can tell you really do care for her and it is stressing you out even more seeing her like this. You are a nurse so you are most likely over worked, underpaid, and constantly stressed. You need to vocalize this to your wife. You both are going through problems and communicating them poorly. That is sadly the reality for majority of relationships. \n    You guys need to plan dates. Plan movie nights at home, picnics in the park, walks, whatever you guys can afford and make work do. Make sure you have the home time too, bc you need your home time. \n     In conclusion the only way to get through this is to have a real conversation. No interruptions, if that is hard for your relationship I suggest getting a talking stick. A lot of relationships would benefit from a talking stick. There is no shouting, name calling, or hate towards one another in this conversation. You take turns with the stick voicing your concerns, feelings and opinions, and solutions. There will definitely be some compromises.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren't your spouse's activities director.

Who made it, you? It\u2019s both your money. If you are dictating how she can spend her money, I\u2019d be pissed like your wife too. We can\u2019t afford it, if we can\u2019t afford to go out once a month we sure as hell can\u2019t afford the bus to work!", "TA for saying she could go into the office for socialization. \n\nIn all reality she couldn\u2019t go to the office for socialization if they share one car and don\u2019t have any extra money for transportation costs. \n\nNTA in general, you\u2019re struggling financially and it\u2019s stressful. You\u2019ve tried to find free things to do but they aren\u2019t social things and that\u2019s what she needs. Maybe find a free concert, museum, or someplace in the world that is very cheap or free.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy doesn't SHE pay for it?", "I think it's the intention to be so \"structured,\" that doesn't sit well. Even if realistically it's what you need to do.", "Then you need to sit her down with the checking account and credit cards and simply ask her...OK, how do you expect to afford this?  That said...until you get your finances squared away, save some pennies and take her to taco bell just as a 'something'.", "YTA. Your wife has let you know what she requires to feel loved and you dismissed her. \n\nThe only thing she sees is that you don\u2019t value her and to you she is worth nothing. Not even the effort of making a plan. \n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to take her out every week. Figure it out! Go to museums of their free day. Take her to the movies on a goddamn Tuesday. Drive to the park and go on a hike. Make a picnic and go to the park. Do something! You must plan it NOT her. \n\nThis isn\u2019t difficult. Plan something and execute it. Or else you will lose your wife. That is a promise. You are already losing her. She is angry now. The moment she stops caring. It\u2019s already done. \n\nWomen leave the relationship emotionally before the leave physically. She is on her way out. This is 100% not about working from home. Read between the lines!\n\nAy yi yi.
