I also read academic books and articles about how slight changes in environment can induce large changes in behavior.\n\nI began preparing homemade hummus every day. I would make hummus from scratch and cut up bell peppers, carrots, and celery for her to eat. Each day I would offer her a hummus and veggie plate a couple of hours before lunch and dinner. My aim was that she would have a healthy snack before meals and therefore eat less carbs/unhealthy food during meals.\n\nThis program worked well, and she lost 10lbs in the span of 2 months.\n\nI was very happy with the results.

This can be considered ethically immoral bc of the reasons stated above. In your case, as her partner, you're choosing to interfere in her life and diet without her consent. Since she did not consent for you to help, what you did can be seen as manipulative, or ethically ambiguous at the least.

Had she regularly weighed herself prior to that to create a weekly running average? I\u2019m a small woman and my weight can fluctuate up to 6 lbs from one day to the next and that\u2019s normal.

I have suggested exercise and diet changes; however, she gets upset every time I suggest a change, even if I don't explicitly mention weight loss.\n\nI did research online about weight loss and learned that the most important thing is to reduce calorie count while maintaining proper nutrition. I also read academic books and articles about how slight changes in environment can induce large changes in behavior.\n\nI began preparing homemade hummus every day. I would make hummus from scratch and cut up bell peppers, carrots, and celery for her to eat. Each day I would offer her a hummus and veggie plate a couple of hours before lunch and dinner. My aim was that she would have a healthy snack before meals and therefore eat less carbs/unhealthy food during meals.\n\nThis program worked well, and she lost 10lbs in the span of 2 months.\n\nI was very happy with the results. The program allowed my girlfriend to lose weight without damaging her self-esteem or body-image, but when I told my best friend and parents about it, they argued that I had taken away her agency and was acting highly paternalistically.

Aren't you happy?\"\n\nYou clearly do not understand boundaries and think you are entitled to \"fixing\" people's insecurities. Maybe you wish others would come in and fix all your insecurities, but don't project that onto us.", "Well yes, she's obviously insecure about it, but that doesn't give him a free pass to go behind her back. Plus, losing weight is about learning to make healthy choices for oneself, he's not even helping her in the long run.", "I don\u2019t see any manipulation. He looked up how to lose weight/live a healthy lifestyle. Then he offered his girlfriend healthy food options. He didn\u2019t limit her to only what he made. He didn\u2019t stop her from eating other foods. He didn\u2019t force her to get up at 5am to run 6 miles. If she didn\u2019t want the hummus and veggies, she didn\u2019t have to eat it.", "Then why doesn\u2019t he own up about his \u201cprogram\u201d to her??", "Ok. So she can lose weight on her own terms, in her own way. If she wanted help, she would ask for help.\n\nAdditionally, what one vents about one day might not be what they really want. Sometimes I vent to my husband and say things like \"I've been contemplating dying my hair this color, what do you think? Getting tired of my blonde\". That is not an invitation for him to dye my hair or secretly put hair dye in my shampoo and keep track of my hair color changes. JFC. I am just simply venting, and then the next day I'll probably be back to liking my blonde as maybe it was just a moment of insecurity.", "Yeah. How could I be so heartless to think that quietly and subtly supporting someone in reaching their goals to help deal with their insecurities was ok?", "Perhaps that is true. That doesn\u2019t mean the correct solution is for the woman to censor herself and not share her worries with her partner.\n\nThat\u2019s fine for dating. But for a solid committed relationship, you need to be able to talk about that stuff. Perhaps, depending on the man, she needs to preface it with \u201cI\u2019m not looking for solutions. I just need to vent.\u201d", "How do you know that? He said he told his parents and best friend about what he did. He didn't say he bragged. You're assuming he was bragging rather than asking for advice.\n\nThere's no trick here. There is nothing deceptive about making someone wholesome, nutritious food. It's good for you. It will make you healthier. **BUT YOU JUST DID THAT BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO BE HEALTHY AND LIVE LONGER SO YOU WON'T BE LONELY IN YOUR OLD AGE! THAT'S SELFISH!**\n\nI mean, ffs, it's hummus and vegetables. It's good for you. That's deceptive?\n\nThis is what couples do. They try to help each other and respect each other with shared goals like being healthy.", "All actions are manipulative and selfish to a large degree.", "The first read I also didn't read it as aggressive, however I do think that of she is getting continuously upset every time he mentions it then it's not helpful for him to keep providing this sort of input.\n\nIt's too hard to say without being there if he is aggressive, demanding or otherwise asshole-ish with the way he approaches it, if she is sensitive, or a bit of both.\n\nBut to feed her specific foods to actively prevent her from eating other foods at lunch and dinner to bring down her weight without letting her do it herself is controlling and not cool. If it was just that he wanted her to be healthier then sure, but the focus on the weight specifically (even if she has complained about it herself) is what makes it a bit yuck for me personally, and so OP YTA\n\nTo add: he could literally have just said at the start \"I want to eat veges before lunch and dinner to be healthier. I'll make a snack tray for us everyday and see if we like it!\" And this would have completely changed this whole scenario and he would be N T A.", ">I didn't read it as aggressive pressuring. I read that she expressed that she wasn't happy with her body and he suggested ways to approach it\n\nThat is because this is what the OP freaking said. So many people make OP out to be some evil fella that crushes the willpower and autonomy of his GF.", "If he told the partner about it??  No\n\nBehind their back??  Yes\n\nEdit-They even wouldn\u2019t be an AH for cooking a healthy meal for dinner.  They would/are an AH for doing it secretly. \n\n\u201cI was very happy with the results. The program allowed my girlfriend to lose weight\u201c\n\nA secret program OP set up and delivered without his girlfriend\u2019s knowledge.", "Yeah, he did research on nutrition, etc, but again- he didn\u2019t force anything on anyone. Sounds kinda thoughtful to me. In fact, I wish he\u2019d teach my SO how to do this! ( he\u2019s a diet saboteur!)", "No she did. She decided to eat the hummus and veggies. She has made active changes to her diet or lifestyle. Honestly, it is super offensive that you denigrate the GF's agency. You act like she is some dolt incapable of making decisions by herself for her own reasons. Just because HE has his own intentions behind giving hummus and veggies to his GF does not mean SHE suddenly has been stripped of the power to CHOOSE what she wants to do.", "He did not go behind her back. He gave her the choice. I agree that losing weight is about making healthy choices for oneself. That is what he is aiding her in doing. She is making the choice to snack on hummus and veggies instead of eating lots of carbs during dinner.", "I agree. I used the analogy in my comment to show how silly that line of logic is.", "it\u2019s actually quite simple, because she didn\u2019t ask for his help. she wanted him to be emotionally available for her to vent about having a hard time, which is a pretty reasonable expectation for a relationship. she never mentioned any sort of \u201cgoal\u201d she simply just wanted to be heard. \n\nalso, not to mention the fact that he did it in secret. she already expressed multiple times that she didn\u2019t want his help. but he decided to keep pushing and completely disregarded her feelings. \n\nSHE DID NOT CONSENT TO HIS HELP you weirdos\n\n***edit because i want to reiterate what i saw another comment say\n\nnotice how he only brings up his feelings about the results? he doesn\u2019t care whether or not she feels better. he is using her to feel accomplished with himself. SO weird.", "I would say that should be said no matter who the person is. It's just good communication. I'm not saying the woman has to censor herself but again these kinds of talks just don't end well typically so maybe not have high expectations on the outcome", "I\u2019m getting that from the parent\u2019s reaction, and OP not stating they asked.", "He devised a sneaky way to get what he wanted. \nCase closed", "You can't be serious. It's not like he's forcing her into eating hummus/not eating carbs, he's just providing an alternative that she enjoys.", "> he didn\u2019t force anything on anyone\n\nManipulation by definition isn't forceful. OP was manipulative - he identified a goal, didn't communicate with his SO, and deliberately did things to encourage her to change her behavior based on his identified goal.", "I\u2019m saying that saying yes to a snack is not the same as making an active change. This is passive. She did not make the decision to eat differently or prepare the humus to lose weight.\n\nAnd of course she can say no. I didn\u2019t say he was limiting her choices. But his intention behind the snack matters. And her level of involvement determines if this was her decision or not.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re the one arguing for the person trying to trick her into losing weight. And who then BRAGS about tricking her into losing weight. What else will he trick her into in order to do what he think is best for her?\n\nThis is a red flag. Might be a repairable one, but that doesn\u2019t negate that his intentions are gross.", "He *did go behind her back* \n\nHe devised and planned this and then bragged about it.", "Their reaction is they thought he somehow deprived his girlfriend of agency by offering her hummas, not that he was bragging. \n\nYou're assuming all sorts of things then holding your assumptions against OP. That's not reasonable.", "World's shittiest detective work right there.", "In the attempt to make her full so she eats less carbs.\n\n\u201cI was very happy with the results. The program allowed my girlfriend to lose weight\u201d\n\nTell me how his \u201cprogram\u201d is healthy??  Not physically but mentally and emotionally healthy??  He\u2019s keeping his \u201cprogram\u201d a secret from her.", "And bragging about it behind her back.", "Manipulation as a term carries a lot of baggage that is not applicable to the given situation. A ton of stuff everyone does, including you, can be considered manipulation. \n\nYou don't like fighting with your significant other? Have you tried subtly steering conversation in a more pleasant and less confrontational manner? Then you, my good friend, have engaged in manipulation.", "Going behind someone's back implies that they had no say/control in the whole scenario. She had the choice whether to eat the hummus and veggies. The bragging about the plan crossed a line, and I called him the AH for it.", "The bragging part I agree with you, he's a total asshole for it.", "> not applicable to the given situation\n\nWhy not? I think it's fully applicable to the situation.\n\nYes, we all engage in manipulation to some degree. OP IMO took it to a creepy place when he consciously RESEARCHED & planned how to manipulate his partner.", "If you extend your logic to different scenarios, then someone would be a manipulative AH if they had marital problems, wanted to visit a counselor with their spouse, their spouse refuses, they go to counseling themselves, learn a lot about how to better connect with their spouse when they are angry in a way to dispel their anger, and used this knowledge without telling their spouse, used what they learned to help improve their relationship.\n\nThe baggage associated with manipulation generally comes from the manipulator gaining something from their victim at their victim's expense. That is not what is going on here."]}
