She's a nurse\n>\n>I am very careful about this and I always challenge myself to stay updated so I corrected her by saying that her response is no longer is accepted in the medical community and I mentioned the studies that had lead to a change in that area.\n\nNTA but idle curiosity, was the topic the \"brain plaque\" studies and the recent findings that they were fraudulent?", "NTA\n\nyou where right to tell your knowledges to your family. On the contrary, you would have let false informations circulating and you would have indirectly approved her response. \n\nBut I personally found that someone who cite specific articles by name can sound pretentious from an outside point of view. Maybe it was the way you formulated it?   \nAnd I understand her feeling embarrassed. She is maybe working in a environment where she is always feeling inferior to the other doctors, and now she maybe feels the same way in her own family.", "NTA.\n\nShe shared outdated knowledge about something in your field. When you told her it was outdated and referenced advancements made in her field, she took it as an attack on her ego rather than learning updated information.\n\nThere's a quote from a Korean philosopher I heard once that I think applies here. \"A master is an eternal student.\"", "Instead of saying that she\u2019s not up on her facts, you could have said that there\u2019s new research, new studies that invalidate ( whatever she said), this way it does not become a family fight\u2026 I mean, who would dispute facts? This way it wouldn\u2019t be personal, and there wouldn\u2019t be a personal conflict.", "in every job it should be common to be up to date. in medical jobs even more so. every first aid lesson there is a diffrent approach on CPR and how to do it. because science behind it gets better. that isnt just to confuse ppl. NTA", "I don't know if this is specifically what OP is referring to, but for a long time it was believed that a buildup of \"brain plaque\" was a significant contributing factor to Alzheimer's. Last year there were findings published that suggest the original study on brain plaque [may have been fabricated.](https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease)\n\n(This is why *replication* is an important part of science.)", "I mean, are doctors unable to be \"outshined\" just because they're doctors? People are just people in all situations. No one is perfect and no one knows everything.", "Thank you, very interesting.  A little sad too, so much deceit in the world."]}
