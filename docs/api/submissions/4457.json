Sorry for him :(", "NTA\n\ni\u2019ve been left home alone for as long as i can remember, and i\u2019m still here, completely fine. a 15-year old can fend for themself, it\u2019s not even like you left him overnight. SIL sounds awful, and to drag it out for two years?? she needs to chill out and get over herself", "My parents left me home alone all of the time, lock the door tell me not to open it to anyone and there was never any problem. Your SIL sounds like she has major double standards if this was her reaction and she herself leaves him on his own regularly.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  OMG, he was 15, nit 5.  SIL is beyond a moron to continue this after 2 years or one hour.  You need to tell her to shut the hell up or just get out of your lives forever.", "NTA.  At 15, he was old enough to be left alone.", "NTA. He\u2019s 15, he can be left home alone. She overreacted and seems like she was waiting for any excuse to drag your name through the mud. She hasn\u2019t tried to resolve the drama\u2026", "NTA\n\nHe's 15 and he didn't want to go. \n\nIt sounds like this was more of a 'make sure kid doesn't die' looking-after than a 'spend quality time with the kid' kinda stay, so it wasn't mean or bad to go do something else. And again, he did not want to go.\n\nObviously he didn't starve in an hour and presumably you fed him at the normal meal times. \n\nAnd he's old enough to stay home for an hour by himself without being in danger. \n\nYou SIL sounds like a dramatic sh\\*t-stirrer.", "NTA\nMy kids were regularly alone long before 15, the know how to nahe frozen pizza and ramen.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s 15 not 5 and he was invited but declined.", "NTA, he\u2019s 15, he\u2019s fine, he wanted to be left alone. SIL was probably embarrassed in front of her friends and thought she looked like a bad mother and wanted to find someone else to blame. Ignore her.", "INFO\nI was just going to say NTA, but there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m wondering. If you were 15 mins away and only gone for half an hour, then you would have only had time to drive there and straight back.\nIs it possible you were gone longer than you remember? Have you ever had an opportunity to talk only to your nephew about his memory of this event? \n\nI still think you are probably NTA, and I\u2019m sorry your SIL\u2019s persistence is causing you to question this.", "NTA, he didn't wanna go, you didn't make him go, you shouldn't miss the tea neither, BUT, probably he lied to his mother about that night, maybe because his mom could get mad at him for staying in the PS so he blamed you, maybe you should ask her what did he tell her that night and clarify the situation like adults, not like preteens spreading rumors.", "NTA. Just look at her next time and ask how often she left him alone with a presumably fully stocked fridge and kitchen. He is clearly capable of making a sandwich.", "NTA. SIL should stop whining.

A 15-year old can stay alone for longer periods of time.", "NTA - He\u2019s 15, he\u2019s legally old enough to work ffs. SIL needs to calm down and stop coddling him.

Some fear or something?\n\nI assume the only reason he'd get picked up early is if *he* called his mom because he felt abandoned, scared or left out. Maybe he wasn't comfortable in your home?", "NTA. I was staying home alone after school and watching my younger brother at around 11. I could make easy dinners for us by like 13. Kids younger than 15 babysit other kids all the time. Your SIL sounds way overbearing and a teenager can take care of himself.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a 15 year old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe would have been fine if you had left him overnight.", "NTA . Psycho Mom was probably looking for an excuse to make a scene. I hope the kid goes nc on her as soon as he's able.", "NTA \u201cI left for an hour while you\u2019ve left him frequently for longer. Do you ever even miss your son while you\u2019re out partying?\u201d\n\nNeglect is a form of abuse and if she has neglected her son before, she should really look to fixing herself before screaming at others. Any future favors will just mean more performative tantrums from this unhinged person.", "He was 15. His mother left him alone for nights to work and party (nights are more dangerous than afternoons) but it would not be okay for you to leave him a short time? When I was 15 I was home alone all day when my parents had to work and I was free all day. I was also home alone in the afternoons when I finished school and my parents weren\u2019t home from work yet since I was 12. I don\u2019t know about the USA or UK but it is very common here in the Netherlands. Children ride their bikes to and from school and stay home alone if their parents are working. Hell, I was having a job at 15 already. And no I am not that old :p (forever 21 but in real life 28). It sounds like your SIL was trying to pick a fight. Let her read alllll the comments here. \n\nNTA.", "She sounds like she failed as a mother if her 15 year old can\u2019t make his own dinner or sit at home for 45 minutes alone. NTA", "I doubt she bothered to listen to him. What 15 year old is going to appreciate afternoon tea?", "I don't expect a 15yo to jump to my defence either, I don't know how he would have felt to have his mother yelling and screaming at us - at 15 I would have been to scared to intervene and say what actually happened.\n\nWhat I had hoped was that SIL would let us explain ourselves, and we have tried since then and she still goes on about it to the point where I've started to doubt myself and that we did the right thing.", "She really does love him and care for him, and does the best job that she can despite some intergenerational family trauma that her and my partner have experienced. Unfortunately, we did end up with him in our care again 12 months later when she required hospitalisation for mental health (made worse by drug use), but she seems to have forgotten about that and keeps going back to this one incident that she swears proves that I am a \"nasty person\".\nHe is actually a really good young man now :)", "It was less than an hour. \nWe rushed home pretty quickly after all the pleasantries were done, even brought a scone home for him \ud83d\ude44", "Sorry, I worded it incorrectly. We were only at Mum's for around half an hour max. We left as quickly as we could so as not to be impolite. So we would have been gone for less than an hour all up. It was definitely a shock to see him getting picked up when we hadn't been gone for that long.\n\nI'm new to Reddit AITA, should I edit my main post to correct it?", "No, SIL had gotten back from her weekend away early and had asked that we look after him the extra night because she had taken drugs that weekend and wanted them to leave her system before she collected him. While we were out she called him to see how he was, and he mentioned that we weren't there. \nSIL then lost her mind, raced over and collected him. We wouldn't have even known if we hadn't got home right at that time, she didn't tell us she was going to pick him up and we would have just found him missing.\n\nI was concerned he might feel abandoned or left out, but he really didn't want to come with us, and we really weren't gone long. His mum leaves him at home all the time, which I had reservations about leaving him but my partner said it would be fine because SIL leaves him alone (often overnight) frequently. I do appreciate though, that being in someone else's house can feel uncomfortable", "Fortnight was more interesting than scones \ud83d\ude02", "yeah I wouldn\u2019t expect ot in the moment either but you\u2019ve said it\u2019s been years and the kid didn\u2019t even mention he didn\u2019t want to go to his mum after hearing her repeatedly badmouth his aunt and uncle?", "With all that extra info\u2026 DEFINITELY NTA. People with trauma have overblown reactions and fixations. It\u2019s like saying swimmers get wet. Let your conscience be clear.", "I wouldn't be surprised if her anger is misdirected anger at herself, as well as embarrassment and shame that she's neglected her son herself.\n\nAs when she leaves her son it's due to neglect and/or drug abuse, I suspect she's assuming you leaving her son was aldi for unsavoury reasons.", "On the plus side, she'll never ask you to babysit again. (not that a 15 yo needs a sitter)", "NTA. Oh man, what a nut job. But at least she cares deeply for her kid...maybe? Or maybe she was just projecting her own feelings of neglecting her kid (taking drugs) onto you.\n\nIf she's refusing to speak to you then all you can really do is take it up with any family member directly. A young adult says they don't want to go, they are responsible and regularly on their own, and you left them for an hour. This is normal.\n\nBut, for the sake of the peace, I'd also probably try apologizing to her in person for not realizing she didn't want him left alone under any circumstances. If you had known that you obviously would have taken him with you.\n\nShe's still wrong and nutty but family peace would probably be worth more than the satisfaction of being right.\n\nGood luck!", "I'll agree to differ with him on that. Give me a lovely scone with jam and cream any day.", "I don't know, maybe he has and she just still hates me so much over this that she doesn't care. I'll never know, I just feel extra shitty every time this gets brought up and it starts another family feud.", "I thought her anger may have been due to coming down from her big weekend, and that maybe she had misunderstood and thought we had gone out to dinner without him (as opposed to just afternoon tea). She thinks I'm stuck up and privileged and is jealous of everything I have/do (including my relationship with her brother). She doesn't realise that I've got and had my own struggles, and is ultimately jealous that I have what appears to be a functional family (actually, I don't). So, she has accused me of choosing my family over hers and then abandoning her son.\n\nShe really does the best she can, and does limit the drug use to times when her son is not in her care. She does love and care for him.", "Unfortunately, we have apologised. At one time she said it doesn't matter and fobbed it off/pretended to forgive us, but now continues to bring it up all time as ammunition about how awful I am. She seems to have forgiven my partner, and it's now all my fault and I am the villain (which is funny, because it was my partner that said our nephew would be okay anyway).\nIt just keeps coming back again and again, and every time I think it's forgotten about, it emerges again.", "He missed out. Mum's scones are the best! Our family friends were from the UK and they were even happy with them \ud83d\ude02", "She can be a person doing her best and still be a negligent parent.\n\nYou're clearly a good person and parent, and it's easier for her to assume you're life is easier and that's why you don't have the same issues as her or other problems, otherwise she has to realise that her choices are the problem.\n\nUnfortunately drugs change brain chemistry permanently with a lot of abuse, so it's quite possible she can't do a lot of reasoning and/or emotional control at this point.\n\nI wish you all the best dealing with her in the future."]}
