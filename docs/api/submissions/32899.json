Please look at comments if you have a question May have been answered \n\ndon\u2019t know if I am the asshole or not for this. Usually my mom will host for Christmas but this year she just can\u2019t keep up. My SIL has been in the family for years and in my opinion she is a food snob. She has multiple allergies, nothing life threatening just unpleasant for her. Since we all understand allergies we make sure to keep everything separate and not cross contaminate. We don\u2019t want to risk her eating something and instead of getting a rash she needs a hospital visit.\n\nNow the reason I think she is a food snob isn\u2019t  due to her allergies, it\u2019s nitpicking the dish mom makes each year. I have watched year after year she makes backhanded comments about the food. My mom told me to stay out of I so I did\n\nTwo years ago there was a mess up and it caused a reaction. It was a huge deal and last year my mom wanted her to bring her own dish since she was worried she would mess up again. This caused a huge fight between them and she threatened to pull the grandkids away if she couldn\u2019t be a good host and give something she could eat. My mom caved. The dinner came and went and she got backhanded comments about the food.\n\nMy mom can\u2019t host anymore and none of my brothers were doing it so I stepped up. I gave SIL a call and told her she needs to bring her own meal. I told her I am not experienced handling allergies and I can not guarantee the food will be safe so I will not make her something. I didn\u2019t tell her but the other reason was I don\u2019t want her bitching about my food.\n\n\nThis caused an argument about me being a horrible host. I made it clear I wouldn\u2019t accommodate her and she doesn\u2019t have to come.

Your SIL is pissed you won't bow down to her demands. She can suck it, lol.", "NTA, \n\nI absolutely believe a host should accommodate guests, when they can be accommodated. For example, most hosts can make 1-2 vegan dishes, or something gluten free (not a gluten free kitchen, but a safe dish), and I think it is rude when a host is like \"I'm not accommodating anyone.\"\n\nHowever, you are not demanding to host, the rest of your family can't/doesn't want to, and you don't feel comfortable making safe accommodations. That's totally fair and it's okay to make that a condition of you hosting. Your brother could host, with SIL and then all the food could be to her liking and safe for her allergies. \n\nAnd then you add in she is a rude guest, even when accommodated, and you are under no obligation to bend over backwards to make her food.", "NTA\n\nSometimes the only winning move is not to play.\n\n(Why am I suddenly craving a Whopper?)\n\n>  she threatened to pull the grandkids away if she couldn\u2019t be a good host and give something she could eat.\n\nBut watch out! You don't want her to withhold access to her children! Oh, the horror! /s", "NTA\n\nThis isn't about the allergies.  This is about power.  She threatened your mom with access to grandkids.  I'll also point out that she and that brother did not step up to take over cooking.\n\nI think you handled this the way she deserved.  Shut it down early and put the onus on her.  Don't be her door mat.", "I'm celiac and have food allergies.

But, it sounds like you all have been accommodating and she has behaved ungraciously. I have many friends with special diets and allergies. The ones I happily accommodate are the ones who are nice, pleasant, and complimentary. I have one friend who, no matter how hard you try, will always have complaints. Complaints about what she can\u2019t eat, complaints about what she can, and new allergies that just popped up and forgot to tell me about. So no, I no longer even try with her and tell her she should probably bring her own meal. This isn\u2019t about you not accommodating your SIL, it\u2019s about you SIL being a pain in the ass.", "NTA I can understand it being considerate to accommodate allergies but your mom has been doing this for years and gotten nothing but grief.

I don\u2019t think this is about her allergies. I thinks it\u2019s more about the lack of appreciation she has shown for your moms efforts all these years. I\u2019m a vegetarian and have been for 7 years now. My brothers girlfriend hosted for 2 years and made sure i had my own main and that I had safe sides I could eat. When my mom did it the next year she was honest that she lacked the time and expertise to make me anything vegetarian for the main part so she asked me to make that part myself and bring it but she made sure the sides were safe for me making different gravy and roast potatoes for me. I appreciated that effort and didn\u2019t have a problem making my own main. The fact is she doesn\u2019t appreciate the time and effort your mom has put into this and to then make back handed comments that\u2019s just so rude. You were right to lay down a clear boundary.", "NTA- if she has so many restrictions then she should bring her own.  Example: if I host I make a normal holiday dinner and then stuff for my restrictions (example: GF stuffing/GF crackers for charcuterie ) \n\nIf we are Invited to a holiday dinner and I know I will want a certain thing (example:stuffing/dessert etc) I will bring my own so that the host doesn\u2019t have to jump through hoops to accommodate and create extra work and spend extra money. 9/10 times I am not the only one enjoying and most of the time my gluten free desserts go quicker than the regular so I always contribute enough to share :) \n\nIs she coming empty handed? If so, who even does that.. she sounds like an entitled brat when you\u2019re Mom was trying her best. \n\nShe can host, stay the fuck home alone and mope or bring her own dishes as she is the one with the \u201crestrictions\u201d and seems to be the only person causing problems for everyone", "Info: what do you mean by backhanded comments? \nI think there needs to be an example of what you consider as her being rude.", "NTA. I have to admit, at first I was going for a different judgement. That was until I read how your SIL have treated your mother who actually have tried to accomodate for so many years. She can bring her own food since nothing is ever good enough. She is flat out rude and entitled.\n\nHOWEVER, do not downplay how severe allergies can be.", "Has your SIL volunteered to host?

If you're going to request a special menu, be grateful that your host has made the effort to accommodate you; don't nitpick the quality of the food. And if the host lets you know in advance they don't think they're going to be able to accommodate you, you either try to work with them to find an acceptable solution or you stay the fuck home!\n\nImagine having the unmitigated gall to respond to an invitation with \"You're a horrible host.\"", "NTA. Your SIL sounds like one though. Threatening to keep away the grandchildren bc of food? She should just stay home.", "NTA My son is allergic to gluten. If another family member is hosting, I will make dessert he can eat, such as a pumpkin pie with a gluten free crust. We help him select his items for the rest of his dinner. \n\nIf someone else is taking care of our son, then the expectation is they will make sure he has food to eat.\n\nThis has never caused any issues. I would never expect a host to plan their menu around my son\u2019s allergies.

Hold your head high for both you and your mom.", "ESH\n\nSIL definitely sounds like a pain, at the same time, OP sounds entirely unsympathetic. You don't have to accommodate everyone at the table, but it's certainly something a good host will generally attempt. \n\nIs it a breech of Xenia to tell her \"bring your own eats or stay home\"? I mean, yeah actually, it is, but so is being discourteous to the host. Not that SIL has had a chance to do so yet, since you assumed she would have been before she could, but the assumption was based on your perspective of how she's treated others.\n\nY'all both ought to be kinder to each other.", "Nta let her say you\u2019re a horrible host. Personally I would let her know that your kitchen is actually open and she can do all the cooking like your mother did as to not risk it.

Good for you for not tolerating her rudeness. NTA", "What are her allergies?

Sometimes allergies aren't going to cause you to stop breathing, but they can make you sick.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t about allergies.

It\u2019s definitely more severe a reaction, especially timing/reaction wise with cheese, but cream-based items can put me there too. \n\nWhile it is always NICE and APPRECIATED when people make me something that I can eat, I never expect it, and always make sure to bring along something I know 100% is safe for me to eat. So so so so so many times people forget that something has dairy in it. It\u2019s so common. Even my own mom forgets sometimes lol. \n\nSounds like SIL loves the attention and getting to be the b**** she really is. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong.

I guess what I\u2019m stuck on are the specific allergies.. typically thanksgiving/Christmas meals are a range of things including meats, casseroles, vegetables etc, and I can\u2019t seem to understand how someone could have an allergy to ALL the foods. \n\nI do suggest having SIL host and do all the cooking herself. It\u2019s very difficult and overwhelming to host so maybe she needs to better understand that by doing it first hand.", "Nta, people with multiple allergies usually being their own food to outings due to not truly knowing of anything is contaminated. Plus she's being an AH to any dishes served to her, she can make her own the exact way she likes them then!", "You follow the logic just fine. \n\nOP is not going to kowtow to SIL.  She either brings her own food, takes her chances, or doesn't come.

It's completely reasonable to ask her to bring her own food if she has complicated requirements. But if your reason is you don't want comments on your cooking, that's a bit petty. \n\nA compromise is to offer to make _something_ that you will do your best to meet her requirements with. It might not even be a main dish, and she'd have to bring her own main dish. And it would be up to her to decide on the risk of eating it. Another option would be to offer to order out for her.", "Nta, sounds like SIL needs to start hosting", "NTA- normally I would jump all over someone not wanting to accommodate an allergy\u2026BUT\u2026your SIL is entitled and just looking for a reason to be snippy and moan about how awful things are and how mean everyone is to her. If there\u2019s something I can\u2019t eat at a gathering, I either bring my own, or I skip the dish. I don\u2019t have an issue doing that. Her threatening your mom over it\u2026is not ok at all. That\u2019s a game I don\u2019t play, and I don\u2019t blame anyone else for not wanting to play it either.

I'm allergic to fire ants.. If I get bit by one I get a hive at the location... but 50 I'm jabbing myself with an EpiPen waiting on the ambulance... So you are wrong for acting like this is a non issue.\n\nHer freaking out about being asked to bring her own dish and calling people poor host and threatening to cut contact with children is unhinged. I may be wrong but it is far more common place for things like this (especially if it is a large family) to be Pot luck style... The host is providing the main dish and the Setting (IE House). Apart from that the host gets to decide the remaining factors and delegate as needed. I've hosted 100s of dinners and never once have I been solely responsible for the entire meal. That is not only an astronomical undertaking but also a huge expense. So for her to be so visceral about this is just weird.

Normally, I would say that you should try to provide a few items your SIL can eat.  However, this is about more than just food allergies and it seems she'd likely complain no matter what.  The fact that your SIL won't even make an attempt to bring something for herself says a lot about her unreasonable sense of entitlement.  You are not her slave here and she needs to be willing to help herself.  Your brother needs to stop being such a wimp and help convince her of that.  \n\nLastly, making the family holiday meal is typically a big effort (and expense).

While I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s allergic to or how hard it is to accommodate (even though it sounds like your mom was able to make a whole meal that was safe), if there\u2019s a potential for her to end up in the hospital, you shouldn\u2019t have those allergens there. Period. Hosts shouldn\u2019t be putting their guests in a position to deal with \u201cjust unpleasant\u201d things either.

It seems to me like your interpretation of her behavior is that you're attributing to nitpickiness what could equally be attributable to her reasonable fear that the food won't be safe for her to eat.\n\nYou also say she \"threatened to pull the grandkids away\" but that is also missing information. Does \"pull the grandkids away\" mean that your SIL threatened to not come over for Christmas?  Or, does \"pull the grandkids away\" mean never seeing the grandkids again?\n\nOther info I didn't see is how far away do this brother and SIL live. I get that redditors think it should be fine for them to travel 4 hours by car with her Christmas dinner in the cooler but I've done it, many times, with food for me and for my allergy kid and frankly, it sucks.

She's one for being rude to your mom, that is never acceptable.. You're one for picking a fight with her and calling her a food snob, and especially for making your brother have to choose sides (FYI, he sleeps with her and she's the mother of his children, he's definitely picking her, as he should.) I have a couple of severe food allergies and one of my cousins once deliberately made a dish with something I'm allergic to (that usually would never contain it) so they could find out how bad my reaction REALLY was. One joyful holiday ER visit later, at their expense, we no longer speak, and never will.

I used to host themed dinner parties and my friends knew how much work went into them so thankfully I wouldn't need to say anything but one time there was a rude guest that made a few snide comments that one of my friends heard and let her have it and she was never invited again even though she wanted to come.", "NTA I think that at a large gathering if you have allergies or eat a different diet, vegan, keto ect, you should bring at least one dish you can eat.

Usually my mom will host for Christmas but this year she just can\u2019t keep up. My SIL has been in the family for years and in my opinion she is a food snob. She has multiple allergies, nothing life threatening just unpleasant for her. Since we all understand allergies we make sure to keep everything separate and not cross contaminate. We don\u2019t want to risk her eating something and instead of getting a rash she needs a hospital visit.\n\nNow the reason I think she is a food snob isn\u2019t  due to her allergies, it\u2019s nitpicking the dish mom makes each year. I have watched year after year she makes backhanded comments about the food. My mom told me to stay out of I so I did\n\nTwo years ago there was a mess up and it caused a reaction. It was a huge deal and last year my mom wanted her to bring her own dish since she was worried she would mess up again. This caused a huge fight between them and she threatened to pull the grandkids away if she couldn\u2019t be a good host and give something she could eat. My mom caved. The dinner came and went and she got backhanded comments about the food.\n\nMy mom can\u2019t host anymore and none of my brothers were doing it so I stepped up. I gave SIL a call and told her she needs to bring her own meal. I told her I am not experienced handling allergies and I can not guarantee the food will be safe so I will not make her something. I didn\u2019t tell her but the other reason was I don\u2019t want her bitching about my food.\n\n\nThis caused an argument about me being a horrible host. I made it clear I wouldn\u2019t accommodate her and she doesn\u2019t have to come. My brother is pissed but my I laughed when I told her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These big get togethers are often more trouble than they are worth.", "How about just going to a restaurant? We started going to the Chinese Buffet for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's a lot easier on everyone, less stress, and everyone gets what they want!", "Well couldnt she host. Oh right. She wants to be catered to.", "NTA. The person with the allergies is responsible for their condition.  It is best when you are not comfortable accepting that responsibility to let them know.", "I have an aunt who is somewhat similar to OPs SIL. Generally, I\u2019m very understanding about food allergies and sensitivities and I enjoy cooking and experimenting enough to want to find alternative dishes or substitutes to accommodate those. But when she starts criticizing, then I\u2019m fully on board with saying that she can cater to her own diet herself.", "NTA. If this were JUST about the allergies I might call you the asshole in the situation, because you seem very glib and dismissive of what can be very serious issues. But the fact that your SIL used the grandchildren as a weapon to try and extort food out of your mom is batcrap insane and immediately made her the asshole in this situation.", "NTA. Tell your SIL since she has a problem every year that she can host and do all the cooking next year.", "SIL can host.\n\nShe seems to know everything about being a great host.", "Nta. In general.  But I would switch these dinners to potluck anyway. There\u2019s no reason that a host has to do all the work when everyone is a grown ass adult. Set up a family text thread and everyone commits to bringing whatever dish/drink/dessert they say. This avoids one person taking on all the work, spreads the family responsibility around so it\u2019s less stressful, and everyone knows there\u2019s something they will or can eat. \n\nI would say, though, that considering SIL has been in the family for years, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to know what she\u2019s allergic to and to keep something separate. In that sense, any host taking on all cooking duties should be able to handle that considering this is family. You\u2019re kinda the AH for acting like her allergies are no big deal and that it should be ok for her to deal with the discomfort those reactions bring her.", "Nta, but since in my culture \u201cbeing a good host\u201d is something we dont care about at all, i cant really judge. Id say she\u2019s already lucky she\u2019s being fed, and you\u2019re supposed to eat whatever is served. And if you cant or wont eat that (due to allergies or other reasons), a good guest is supposed to offer to bring something themselves (which after offering, most people would accommodate to that person, but the polite thing to do as a guest is to at least offer to bring something yourself) \n\nBut anyway, hospitality is more important in most cultures. But to me she\u2019s just sounds very entitled", "NTA: As someone with many food allergies I never expect to be accommodated and always bring something I can eat. If I am accommodated wonderful!

Especially not family. We just bring our own food.", "NTA. The absolute disrespect SIL showed your family who bent over backwards to accommodate her dietary needs is astonishing.

Quite the contrary, you're a very good host, as you take SIL's allergies serious and own up to the fact, that you have no experience with that and don't want to take the risk of her getting ill because of that. So, it's reasonable for her to bring her own food.\n\nIn her eyes, you are horrible, because this way you deprive her of the opportunity to make the backhand comments about your food. Seems that's her only pleasure she has at those events.", "NTA. I have people with similar food sensitivities in my family and they simply bring their own food, and enough to share. It\u2019s polite to bring something, even if you are a guest. The burden is not on the host to be a personal chef.", "NTA, my daughter and I have severe food allergies and I NEVER expect people to accommodate us. Either we don't eat or we bring our own. Your brother is an asshole too.", "NTA. Your mom laughed from relief.", "Oh, I thought you were going to be the AH, but under the circumstances, you are NTA.  She can bring her own food; you AREN'T experienced with dealing with allergies, and she's been an AH before about people trying their best.  Don't do it.", "NTA, Why can't they host since she has such requirements?", "NTA\n\nI would always have her bring her own dishes from now on. I understand you don't want to be nitpicked but as someone who has a life-threatening food allergy, that's the safest and easiest option for everyone. Nothing is worse than a guest pestering you about what YOU ARE MAKING FOR THEM. \n\nYears ago, my MIL made something trying to accommodate multiple dietary restrictions (five all together - mine was the only life-threatening one). I almost took a helping of it before she realized that she had accidentally used my worst allergen (nuts) in an attempt to accommodate her vegan daughter. She stopped me just in time and from then on, I haven't eaten anything she's made if it's been made to work for another restriction. While this was a genuine mistake that was caught in time, there have been plenty of other scares partly because I didn't think to ask (I never thought anyone would blend nuts into butternut squash soup, like my friend did and told me after I took one bite) or because the cook doesn't have allergies and had forgotten (which I can understand if they aren't part of your life it'd be easy to forget, especially if it wasn't made clear). \n\nHowever, if I'm not confident in the cook I always check ahead of time and often feel more comfortable bringing my own stuff. Or prepare it onsite. There are a LOT of options here. I would rather do almost anything that have to use my epi-pen.\n\nYour SIL sounds like a nightmare and I think it was a good call telling her to figure it out. You probably saved yourself a HUGE headache. If she doesn't want to come, she doesn't have to. :)", "INFO: \n\nIf your sister is so critical of everyone's cooking, why doesn't she host dinner?", "NTA. She is being horrible. I have celiac disease and don't trust most people to know what to serve me.

The company of others is why I go to holiday meals not the food.", "You are definitely NTAH. I came here to offer some advice if she is rude again and starts acting entitled. Stay calm, and whatever rude thing she says, repeat it back slowly and say \u201cyou really feel good about making that comment?\u201d And nothing else. The repeating it back forces her to hear her own horrible words again and the second comment drives it in how dickish she\u2019s being and hopefully (but not guaranteed) hits her guilt and shame. This works on narcissists because they often don\u2019t think about what they say (why would they, a narcissist always thinks they are right). The key is staying calm. If you\u2019re calm, matter of fact she won\u2019t feel like lashing out. And if she does, it just highlights her true colors. Keep riding it out on the high road and let her wreck herself on the low road.", "Definitely nta! Tell them next year they have to host and make all of your favorite dishes! Then you make back handed comments about her cooking. She sounds entitled and spoiled!", "I think NTA. Some allergies can be managed in house and some can't, even for people with experience. Stating that you don't feel comfortable cooking for her is completely appropriate. Sending a few restaurant options etc to ask if there's anything you can facilitate ordering for her or ensuring there's a safe place for her to prepare food in the house could be a nice bridge. For example, there's a gluten free bakery in my town I could order some things for.  But it sounds like she isn't quite worth extending those bridges out for. \n\nI'm seafood plus semi nightshade allergic and I'm used to having allergy conversations with friends. As adults, we're generally used to these conversations and understand how to facilitate a host with different tips or requests depending on the hosts attention budget.

People with life threatening food allergies know what to do to reduce the risk and sometimes that means we have to bring our own food and our epipen. Some allergies are relatively easy to work around, others are not. If a person's allergies are solely to one thing (for example, to eggs or gluten) it's not that hard to cater to. The more allergies a person has, the harder it is to accommodate them in a wider group meal and they should probably take responsibility for bringing things they can eat. A family meal is not like dining at a high end restaurant, you don't get to complain about the food, the ambience or the service BECAUSE YOU ARE A GUEST NOT A CUSTOMER.", "Kudos to you!", "NTA.

This way, SIL can be guaranteed she will have food that isn't subpar and will not have allergens in it. \n\nI also have a sister who LOVES to make backhanded snide comments about what a **/s** \"wonderful\" cook she is.

She wouldn't know, she doesn't live in the same state I do. She got to my Mom's (flew in), sat down, and begrudgingly fixed herself one small teaspoon of my Great-grandmother's stuffing. Took a bite of it, looked at my Mom, and asked her when she cooked it. I just rolled my eyes and finished taking the rest of the shit out of the oven. She never once offered to finish helping me cook. My Mom told her I cooked it. She went and looked in the TRASH FOR THE BOXES!

The family has made it a point to have absolutely no peanuts or peanut products anywhere near gatherings, and I have told people, don't worry about the intolerance, I can pop a few lactaid and go about eating. Some allergies or intolerance are harder to accommodate because or expenses. I usually get told that I can just eat vegan stuff, the issue is that most, if not all vegan products have peas in them, which I'm severely allergic too as well. On top of that, it's too expensive. Point is your SIL should be more worried about her health and take her allergies into her own hands and not rely on other people to cater to her. Of course family should try their best, but her allergies are her own problem and should mitigate them as much as possible. The fact that she threatened people to cater or else, means that she feels entitled to people bowing down to her and her allergies.

As for the bitching about the food, I would tell her \"You know, you always have something to say about the food at Christmas, how about you host this year and you can cook something up to your standards as well as make sure your allergies aren't irritated.\" Watch how fast she turns that down.

On the other hand, at least SIL knows where she stands with you.", ">I told her I am not experienced handling allergies and I can not guarantee the food will be safe\n\n>This is perfectly appropriate, especially given the need for safety. \n\nI'd try to keep the focus on the issue of safety. Tell her that you don't want to cook something that *might* be safe for her. You don't want to take the risk of missing something or having cross-contamination and sending her to the hospital.", "Let's be real. If she was nice about it, everyone would be willing to try and make that effort for her. But she is not. And this is a consequence of her actions. She was nasty and now op won't turn her kitchen upside down to make a special dish only to be insulted. And that is completely fair. OP decided to say that they weren't comfortable with it because a confrontation with SIL is not winnable or worth it since she won't take it well or change her behavior. \n\nAnd that is a very reasonable response.", "Don't threaten me with a good time", "I have a tree nut allergy, and I\u2019ve run into the same thing. Every holiday my grandma would make some incredible homemade dessert *that had nuts in it*. There were plenty of times when it would have been entirely possible to make the dessert without the nuts too. My dessert would be a scoop of freezer-burnt vanilla ice cream. It tasted bad, and I felt really hurt being excluded. I\u2019ve also run into people who will tell me to just scrape off the nuts or eat around something then get upset when I say that I can\u2019t. \n\nI really have to wonder what context the SIL\u2019s comments are coming from and what she\u2019s actually saying. If it\u2019s something along the lines of \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable eating that,\u201d especially after she\u2019s been exposed to something she\u2019s allergic to in the past, then I don\u2019t thinks she\u2019s the one on the wrong.", "Mom only said to stay quiet when mom was in the firing line. Mom is no longer the target. All heckers can break loose and mom gets to stay quiet, laugh herself silly afterwards.", "NTA.

It won't be the same as everyone else, but she can safely eat her gluten free, dairy free, no garlic pizza, and everyone else can have a nice dinner?", "Wow, I thought I was the only person in the world who had an issue with raw and not cooked??? Mine isn't anaphylaxis but gastro in a truly miserable way.  People think I'm lying because I can sometimes tolerate small amounts of cooked but raw will make me miserable within an hour.", "Same, allergic to chicken. There's no way I'd be that awful to someone over my allergy. SIL sounds quite nasty.", "Yes it\u2019s your responsibility but that doesn\u2019t negate anyone else\u2019s responsibility.  Knowing someone has a food allergy and doing nothing about is just plain mean.", "Of course. Any parent is perfectly allowed to not let anyone, whoever, see their kids.\n\nBut if it is response to a concerned grandparent not wanting to unwittingly induce an allergic reaction in someone, and thereby requesting they bring their own dish, then it's a pretty shitty reaction. They are still perfectly entitled to say whoever can see their kids, but in that case it is a total arsehole move.", "I have coeliac and have the attitude that when I eat something I didn't prepare, it's my responsibility. If I get sick from cross contamination, that's a risk I take for eating out or at the home of someone who doesn't have a gluten free kitchen. It's great when someone wants to make food I can eat but if they're not confident to do that, I'll bring a dish (or two)I know is safe. \n\nHonestly, if a host is upfront about not being able to provide food I can eat safely, I'm fine with that, so long as they tell me before I arrive at their house hungry!", "It wouldn't work on me either if her kids are ill-behaved poop bags.", "I won't eat food other people made. My family was pushy about it, and kept contaminating my safe foods that I had made, so I quit going to any family gatherings involving food.  I can eat food my daughters made, but that's really it. I can't even eat food around my mother in my own house because she'll put her grubby peanut fingers in it.", "I\u2019m allergic to peanuts, tree nuts, peas, chickpeas, and soy. \n\nI attended my boyfriend\u2019s family\u2019s Thanksgiving this year and you know what? There was stuff I couldn\u2019t have like stuffing, gravy, or the salad (it had peas in it), but I just went on with my day because the world doesn\u2019t revolve around my allergies. I didn\u2019t even bring up I was allergic. If I insisted on having those things, I would\u2019ve just made and brought them myself.", "Yeah, I've got celiac, and my family acts like this. Once they told me something was gluten-free, then after I ate it, they revealed they weren't sure what all the ingredients were or if it was safe. When I then became anxious that I was going to get sick, they called me dramatic and overreacting. \n\nFor years after, I'd get passive-aggressive comments at every holiday that I better bring my own food so as not to cause drama about things being safe, and if I eat their food, then that's my own risk to take. Was told that I was too picky and nagging and stuck up. \n\nI don't invite my family into my home anymore because they always bring in gluten despite me asking them not to. The adults have also made \"accidental\" messes of their gluten filled food on my furniture and then made fun of me for trying to thoroughly clean it up. As if I should enjoy leaving my allergen sprinkled into my couch. \n\nMaybe due to my history with my shitty family I'm reading too much into this, but there seems to be more to this story. I can definitely see myself getting to the end of my rope and telling them they can't see my kids anymore. Especially since allergens/autoimmune issues are often genetic, there's a chance the kids also have this allergy and are being treated shitty too.", "The thing is, OP doesn\u2019t clarify what the \u201cnitpicking\u201d or \u201cbackhanded comments\u201d are (and based on the edit, it won\u2019t be clarified either). SIL has every right to be wary about what\u2019s being cooked, especially since OP\u2019s family is still cooking with whatever SIL is allergic to (is it possible for them to avoid the allergens completely? Are they just refusing to do so? Guess we\u2019ll never know) and since OP\u2019s mom\u2019s carelessness caused her to have an allergic reaction (did mom even apologize? Another detail OP left out). Another commenter also pointed out that allergies can be hereditary. If SIL\u2019s kids develop allergies (or currently have them), OP\u2019s family refuses to accommodate allergies, and they berate SIL for being concerned about allergies, why would she put her kids in that kind of situation? There\u2019s a lot of missing context there, and OP is refusing to provide it. \n\nWhat *is* provided is this: OP\u2019s family is clearly capable of providing a dish or two that can accommodate SIL\u2019s allergies. SIL isn\u2019t even asking for the entire meal, just to be able to eat something. It\u2019s rude to invite someone for a meal but not provide anything they can eat.", "I don't think \"if you can't accommodate my allergy, we'll have Christmas dinner at home/at their other grandparents/etc\" is necessarily an AH move. I wouldn't spend every Christmas with someone who cooked for everyone but me.", "Than she can shut up about it.", "Tell her your house is too small for her sense of entitlement.", ">What *is* provided is this: OP\u2019s family is clearly capable of providing a dish or two that can accommodate SIL\u2019s allergies\n\nYes.... That's the whole point; they can, and have done, only for SIL to be insulting and whinging about the dish. \n\nSo... Op and their mother doesn't want to cook for SIL anymore. I don't blame them, it is not enjoyable to specifically cook for someone who then makes you feel bad about it. Year after year.", "Yeah but the mom has been cooking to include her DIL's dietary requirements and still getting mistreated for it regardless. I wouldn't want to spend every Christmas with someone who was an ungracious and ungrateful guest with nothing nice to say.", "To add to what other commenters said, things you may dip into need to be considered. You can\u2019t use the butter stick that is used for buttering toast, or a jam jar for example. If a utensil has touched a gluten source and then touched another food source is contamination. \n\nMy parents have a friend who has severe celiac reactions, they will buy new butters/sauces/etc to prepare a meal for him to ensure no cross contamination has occurred.", "Celiac isn't life or death.  My sister was diagnosed when she was 2 as she had massive problems, she was skin and bones with a huge bloated tummy before they figured it out.  So yeah, it's pretty bad but it's not like you go into anaphalactic shock.  It's nothing to be scared about, just cook with real food (it's the boxed, frozen stuff you need to be careful of) use cornstarch instead of flour and bob's your uncle. Yes, different utensils but literally turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy can all be made, naturally gluten free.  It's more that you're preparing the things 'with' gluten separate. (stuffing for example). Just make it put it in a dish and label it 'gluten'. There really is no cross contamination...if you stir a sauce with gluten in it and that spoon rests on the counter then another spoon touches the 'wet mark' from the last spoon, you literally won't have any trouble.  Again, it's not like peanuts.  There really is no freak-out.  My sister even eats cheesecake and just scoops it off the crust.  If a crumb or two is attached, she won't notice. IF she has a bit too much she gets red faced and sore tummy but that's if she goes in for an entire bite or two of something.", ">One of my coworkers traveled form Kansas to Chicago by car over Thanksgiving and made several dishes that traveled with her. It's possible.\n\nSafe long distance, multiple hot-dish transport is a midwestern core competency.  I'm pretty sure it's on their drivers' tests.", "> She's not malicious, just incredibly dim.\n\nThis is what I've learned to assume.  \"Mashed potatoes\" don't contain dairy in my dad's mind.  He considers them a single mass even though he's the one who added the butter and milk to them.", "TIL that you should wipe down the oven if you are trying to avoid cross contamination with gluten.... I would have never considered that (I have never had to cook for anyone that has celiac) even though I knew you needed to use freshly cleaned counters, pots, and utensils.", "We use the toaster for gluten free bread...why not? Becuase gluten has touched the side coils?  No way man, that's not needed.\n\nUnless your doctor has said differently, celiac does not give you life-threatening reactions from eating a bit of something. It's not like peanut allergies.  Celiac is autoimmune and you can get reactions like red itchy skin, sore stomach, etc. but it's not happening from a crumb.  She's not going to eat a bun or something but if she has a bite of something with gluten gravy on it, it's no biggie.", "Good grief, 4 hours is not a long time to transport pies or cole slaw in an ice chest.", "Have you ever been camping? Food can stay fine in a cooler for an entire weekend let alone a 4-hour trip. Assemble, then cook at the host's house. Or re-heat.

But I use my oven about 3 times a year \ud83d\ude06 I would however do a quick check that there aren\u2019t any crumbs inside. I do occasionally heat up pizza in it, so at least the bottom would get a wipe (oo-er missis). I can imagine someone who cooks a lot in the oven and maybe doesn\u2019t clean it much might have more debris in there.", "If I ate a bite of something with gluten gravy on it, I would be sick for weeks. In my house we have two toasters; one toaster for gluten free bread and one for gluten containing bread.", "This is the correct take IMO. There\u2019s so much context missing (and it\u2019s a bit fishy OP refuses to provide it), and conversations are so easily misinterpreted, especially when emotions are running high. Maybe SIL is an unhinged jerk. Maybe OP\u2019s family is a bunch of uncaring AHs. Hard to say without full context. \n\nThe concrete facts that we do have are that OP\u2019s family still cooked with whatever SIL is allergic to despite there being a potential for it to put SIL in the hospital (and side note: OP refuses to elaborate on what the allergies are/ how hard or easy it would be to accommodate them), and it caused SIL to have an allergic reaction. I have food allergies that are easy enough to work around, but I\u2019ve had to deal with people who don\u2019t take them seriously and/ or interpret me looking out for myself as a personal affront. Hard to be the nice guy when people don\u2019t care about their actions putting you in the hospital or get mad at you for being genuinely concerned for your health.", ">would you eat cornbread that was in the car for 4 hours? would you eat cookies that were in a car for 4 hours?

Also, I've driven 14 hours with ice cream on ice in a cooler and it was still frozen solid so I don't know why people are concerned. IDC if you're driving LA to NYC. There are places along the way to top off the ice.", "How quickly people forget.  When I was in school, my mother would make my lunch at 7:30Am to be eaten at noon, and nobody had coolers or refrigerators for that.
