He and I had been friends for 5 years. \n\n\nSo, I year ago I got hired in as a manager at an auto parts store. I did not know my friend S worked there too because he was on vacation when I was hired. We have been friends for about 5 years and made jokes with each other all the time. I\u2019m able to turn off \u201cfriend mode\u201d when at work and that\u2019s something S has always struggled with. \n\nBeing the only female in the parts store had me it easy for customers to make judgements and lewd comments. I\u2019m used to it. From customers. My coworkers know my boundaries and don\u2019t make such comments. \n\nAbout 2 weeks ago, S and I were closing and I was working on a shelving fixture when he called for me to come up and put in my manager code. I don\u2019t remember what for. I answered that I\u2019d be right there with my pen in mouth because my hands were full.\n\nWhen I came up he was laughing because I sounded funny when I answered him. I told him it was because my pen was in my mouth. He laughed and said \u201cyou like things in your mouth, don\u2019t you?\u201d IN FRONT OF A CUSTOMER!!!! \n\nBeing that we\u2019re friends, if he had said that same line outside of work, it probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered me. But I\u2019m his boss and he said in front of a customer. \n\nI notified my boss, who notified his boss, who notified HR. Now S is being transferred out of the store and is being put through the \u201crespect in the workplace\u201d course. Which goes on his record with the company and he\u2019s being moved to a store with no female employees. \n\nS is obviously very mad about the transfer and blames me. He told me to never talk to him again and called me a petty bitch. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683598447, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ccdfm/aita_for_reporting_my_friend_to_hr/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s called common sense. I\u2019ve been personal friends with supervisors before. Joking around and being inappropriate is fine outside of work (if that\u2019s their sense of humor too) but I never even thought of saying something inappropriate at work. Because it\u2019s work.", "NTA. Work is work, and a certain level of professionalism ought to be expected, regardless of prior relationships. His reaction at the end only solidifies that you did the right thing.", "NTA. Sounds like friendship is over. Clearly he doesn\u2019t understand that jokes on the clock aren\u2019t acceptable like they would be when drunk at the bar joking around.", "NTA - maybe you could have handled it better but that was inappropriate for him to say. But how good of friends could you have been if you didnt know where he worked?", "Nta. He knew that was wrong. He thought he could get away with saying things like that. You could have addressed it directly but if you already had conversations about boundaries, he was given more than enough notice that work and play are different. Either way that is sexual harassment. Things like that don't require multiple warnings.", "NTA! What he said in front of customers was not acceptable.", "NTA. Gross and good riddance.", "NTA. I get the difficulty of having friends be under you as a manager. I\u2019m currently in that position myself. However, we have all, on several occasions, had the discussion of work life and behavior versus personal life and behavior. \n\nI might not have been upset if a friend that I managed made a comment like that to me at work if nobody else was around, but the fact that your friend did it in front of a customer was completely unprofessional and he should receive some form of reprimand for it. It was his own actions that got him in trouble, not you.", "NTA. I haven't even read the comments yet, but I'd guess many of them are saying something along the lines of, it's not your behavior that got him transferred \u2014 it's his behavior.\n\nI guess you could you show him the posts if he talks to you again. But otherwise, I would say you are well rid of him. Anyone who would call someone a \"petty bitch\" is not your friend.", "NTA.\n\nHe attempted to humiliate you in front of a customer as some kind of weird flex. Super inappropriate both for the innuendo and trying to make you look bad. Good for you for not tolerating that garbage, maybe he'll give up the gross behavior moving forward.", "NTA - Your 'friend' needs to learn some manners at work.  Work is work and you're the boss.", "NTA, what is he 12?? \u201cHur dur penis joke aren\u2019t I funny?\u201d  He needs to learn how to behave in the workplace. Though I would say if you are his boss, I expect it would have been up to you to discipline him with a write up. 3 bosses and HR for a jackass comment is a little overkill.", "NTA, not even a little bit.  Although common sense isn't all that common, he should've known on some level that his words were completely inappropriate in the workplace.\n\nIf this is how he treats his friends, consider yourself lucky to no longer be a part of that club.\n\nI think you also made a wise decision to directly report him to HR over this; based on his behavior towards you both before and after being reported, it seems like he doesn't have much respect towards women.  His reaction to you confronting his behavior could've been worse, and you handled it safely and professionally.", "NTA it's his stupid comment. You have the right to a harassment free workplace", "NTA", "NTA. Just because you're friends doesn't mean you should out up with that garbage. Too many dudes use any excuse to demean women, and it's getting old.", "NTA - OP always remember that you pay your bills, not your friend or anyone else there, so there's no reason to jeopardize your job.  It could have been worse if he wasn't reported and the customer made the complaint - then it would have reflected on your skills as a manager.  Never forget you can't always be friends with people you work with - they probably won't be paying your bills if you try to cover for their stupidity.", "NTA", "NTA. Your friend needed to learn not to treat colleagues like that. He's just upset you're the first manager to hold him accountable", "NTA.  What he said was completely inappropriate, and just telling him that would not have caused h to respect that (or you).", "NTA.", "NTA there is a time and a place for that and it is not at work.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to look in the mirror, cause when he does, he will see who's fault it really is. It's one thing to make a joke like that in private with a friend, it's quite another to do that in front of a customer. If I were that customer, I would have told him off and called the district manager myself. That shit ain't cool.", "NTA - though I think it might have been better if you'd given him a warning first, simply because he is your friend, I understand why you would just report him immediately and you were 100% in the right to do so.", "NTA. \n\nI would have probably made it less official at first, because some dumb people really do think it\u2019s funny and don\u2019t realise how demeaning it can be. \n\n\nBut even though you didn\u2019t i still think NTA because ultimately you don\u2019t have to burden yourself making it a teachable moment", "Doesn\u2019t really sound like your friends. I can tell you for a fact i wouldn\u2019t jeopardize anybody\u2019s job, never-mind my friends because he made a joke, your mental", "I hate the fact that victims have to question if they were wrong to not want to be abused. Like because he thought of you as a friend, he thought it was okay to say that to you? When you've never previously accepted such behavior? And then blames you when he got in trouble for his bad behavior? He's lucky the customer didn't complain to corporate either. You are NTA. You don't have to accept comments from customers, guests, strangers, coworkers, friends, aquantainces, family or anybody else.", "Did you give him a warning first? Did you have had a conversation with him about why that\u2019s not appropriate? I only say that because you had a prior relationship and while you have a right to do whatever you need to do to feel comfortable in the workplace - it does feel just a tad extreme.", "Yeah, yeah kinda. Is your friend way out of line, of course. But people slip up and especially if this is how you behave outside of work, you've gotta expect an accident or two. Whats really gross is that you went straight to the rabid hyenas at HR rather than just, y'know, ironing it out with your lifelong friend. \n\nI mean, that's the end of the friendship. He slips up and embarrasses you, so you coldly toss him to dogs. You've permanently stunted his career because of an ill-timed joke that you otherwise wouldn't have had a problem with. \n\nYou're soulless lizard, ma'am. I'd have that checked out if I were you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
