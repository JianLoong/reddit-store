He\u2019s made comments about our female delivery driver and a few customers when they were out of your shot.

But how good of friends could you have been if you didnt know where he worked?\n\nEdit - with edit 2, escalating this was really your only course of action as he already had a history in inappropriate behavior.", "Nta. He knew that was wrong. He thought he could get away with saying things like that. You could have addressed it directly but if you already had conversations about boundaries, he was given more than enough notice that work and play are different. Either way that is sexual harassment. Things like that don't require multiple warnings.", "NTA! What he said in front of customers was not acceptable.", "NTA. Gross and good riddance.", "NTA. I get the difficulty of having friends be under you as a manager. I\u2019m currently in that position myself. However, we have all, on several occasions, had the discussion of work life and behavior versus personal life and behavior. \n\nI might not have been upset if a friend that I managed made a comment like that to me at work if nobody else was around, but the fact that your friend did it in front of a customer was completely unprofessional and he should receive some form of reprimand for it. It was his own actions that got him in trouble, not you.", "NTA. I haven't even read the comments yet, but I'd guess many of them are saying something along the lines of, it's not your behavior that got him transferred \u2014 it's his behavior.\n\nI guess you could you show him the posts if he talks to you again.

Anyone who would call someone a \"petty bitch\" is not your friend.", "NTA.\n\nHe attempted to humiliate you in front of a customer as some kind of weird flex.

Although common sense isn't all that common, he should've known on some level that his words were completely inappropriate in the workplace.\n\nIf this is how he treats his friends, consider yourself lucky to no longer be a part of that club.\n\nI think you also made a wise decision to directly report him to HR over this; based on his behavior towards you both before and after being reported, it seems like he doesn't have much respect towards women.  His reaction to you confronting his behavior could've been worse, and you handled it safely and professionally.", "NTA it's his stupid comment. You have the right to a harassment free workplace", "NTA", "NTA. Just because you're friends doesn't mean you should out up with that garbage.

It could have been worse if he wasn't reported and the customer made the complaint - then it would have reflected on your skills as a manager.  Never forget you can't always be friends with people you work with - they probably won't be paying your bills if you try to cover for their stupidity.", "NTA", "NTA.

It's one thing to make a joke like that in private with a friend, it's quite another to do that in front of a customer. If I were that customer, I would have told him off and called the district manager myself. That shit ain't cool.", "NTA - though I think it might have been better if you'd given him a warning first, simply because he is your friend, I understand why you would just report him immediately and you were 100% in the right to do so.", "NTA. \n\nI would have probably made it less official at first, because some dumb people really do think it\u2019s funny and don\u2019t realise how demeaning it can be. \n\n\nBut even though you didn\u2019t i still think NTA because ultimately you don\u2019t have to burden yourself making it a teachable moment", "Doesn\u2019t really sound like your friends.

Is your friend way out of line, of course. But people slip up and especially if this is how you behave outside of work, you've gotta expect an accident or two. Whats really gross is that you went straight to the rabid hyenas at HR rather than just, y'know, ironing it out with your lifelong friend. \n\nI mean, that's the end of the friendship. He slips up and embarrasses you, so you coldly toss him to dogs.

First, how can you be friends with someone for five years and not know or have ever touched on where each other works? Since adults spend most of our waking hours working at some type of job, I'd imagine talking about work, even in passing, would have come up in five long years. Secondly, how would you know your friend has trouble with boundaries between work and his personal life if he hadn't touched on the matter with you prior to your making such a conclusion?\n\nAll that being said, you had every right to feel offended at having a lewd comment made in the workplace. I hope you do not fall into the trap of even considering if you were too \"sensitive.\" The comment was disrespectful, unnecessary, and inappropriate. It's unfortunate that it resulted in your friend being transferred to another store, but that outcome was still mild. In my experience, any lewd or sexist word or act that creates a hostile working environment results in termination.", "I find that these comments are really revealing in regards to how men and women respond to sexual harassment. (Some) Men love to downplay harassment as \"jokes\" and \"cheeky comments,\" and they routinely tell women we're \"overreacting\" when we don't appreciate their inappropriate comments. The whole thing feels tangentially related to the ridiculous \"men just can't be comfortable *talking* to women anymore!!1!\" adage that becomes popular anytime women start to loudly and collectively speak out against sexual harassment. Lots of men would most likely feel far more comfortable knowing that they can make sexual suggestions whenever they want to, without having to consider the feelings or reaction of the person to whom the suggestion was made. And that every woman they sexually harass should take them aside and ever-so-gently admonish them in private each time they make a \"joke.\" Which is why I believe that any commenters insisting that \"it was just a jOkE, you should have spoken to him about it pRiVaTeLy\" are men who genuinely think the distaste and offense of the person being joked at/about is irrelevant and doesn't compare to their desire to make women feel uncomfortable.", "NTA.  You did the appropriate thing and he suffered the consequences for what is apparently an ongoing issue with him. Did you talk to him personally about it before reporting him?  Would you have done so if he wasn't a personal friend? I think the awkwardness of your personal relationship may have made it harder for you to talk to him as his manager. \n\nIf you had given him a verbal warning, do you think it would have been the last time he did something like that?  I doubt it, given the company's swift action in reprimanding him and relocating him.  It's unfortunate, but maybe he will learn from his actions this time.  \n\nIt's bizarre that he didn't speak to you like that during your friendship yet thought it was okay at work in front of a customer.  Sounds like he has problems with women in a position of authority over him.  \n\nJust remember, you are not responsible for his actions.

That's how it works. OP would get blamed by her management for allowing that behavior, and OP's management would get blamed by corporate for OP's lack of professional management of the store.
