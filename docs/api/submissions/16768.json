I\u2019m able to turn off \u201cfriend mode\u201d when at work and that\u2019s something S has always struggled with. \n\nBeing the only female in the parts store had me it easy for customers to make judgements and lewd comments.

I don\u2019t remember what for. I answered that I\u2019d be right there with my pen in mouth because my hands were full.\n\nWhen I came up he was laughing because I sounded funny when I answered him.

Now S is being transferred out of the store and is being put through the \u201crespect in the workplace\u201d course. Which goes on his record with the company and he\u2019s being moved to a store with no female employees. \n\nS is obviously very mad about the transfer and blames me.

But how good of friends could you have been if you didnt know where he worked?", "Nta. He knew that was wrong. He thought he could get away with saying things like that. You could have addressed it directly but if you already had conversations about boundaries, he was given more than enough notice that work and play are different. Either way that is sexual harassment. Things like that don't require multiple warnings.", "NTA! What he said in front of customers was not acceptable.", "NTA. Gross and good riddance.", "NTA. I get the difficulty of having friends be under you as a manager. I\u2019m currently in that position myself. However, we have all, on several occasions, had the discussion of work life and behavior versus personal life and behavior. \n\nI might not have been upset if a friend that I managed made a comment like that to me at work if nobody else was around, but the fact that your friend did it in front of a customer was completely unprofessional and he should receive some form of reprimand for it. It was his own actions that got him in trouble, not you.", "NTA. I haven't even read the comments yet, but I'd guess many of them are saying something along the lines of, it's not your behavior that got him transferred \u2014 it's his behavior.\n\nI guess you could you show him the posts if he talks to you again.

Anyone who would call someone a \"petty bitch\" is not your friend.", "NTA.\n\nHe attempted to humiliate you in front of a customer as some kind of weird flex.

Although common sense isn't all that common, he should've known on some level that his words were completely inappropriate in the workplace.\n\nIf this is how he treats his friends, consider yourself lucky to no longer be a part of that club.\n\nI think you also made a wise decision to directly report him to HR over this; based on his behavior towards you both before and after being reported, it seems like he doesn't have much respect towards women.  His reaction to you confronting his behavior could've been worse, and you handled it safely and professionally.", "NTA it's his stupid comment. You have the right to a harassment free workplace", "NTA", "NTA. Just because you're friends doesn't mean you should out up with that garbage.

It could have been worse if he wasn't reported and the customer made the complaint - then it would have reflected on your skills as a manager.  Never forget you can't always be friends with people you work with - they probably won't be paying your bills if you try to cover for their stupidity.", "NTA", "NTA. Your friend needed to learn not to treat colleagues like that. He's just upset you're the first manager to hold him accountable", "NTA.

It's one thing to make a joke like that in private with a friend, it's quite another to do that in front of a customer. If I were that customer, I would have told him off and called the district manager myself. That shit ain't cool.", "NTA - though I think it might have been better if you'd given him a warning first, simply because he is your friend, I understand why you would just report him immediately and you were 100% in the right to do so.", "NTA. \n\nI would have probably made it less official at first, because some dumb people really do think it\u2019s funny and don\u2019t realise how demeaning it can be. \n\n\nBut even though you didn\u2019t i still think NTA because ultimately you don\u2019t have to burden yourself making it a teachable moment", "Doesn\u2019t really sound like your friends.

Did you have had a conversation with him about why that\u2019s not appropriate?

Is your friend way out of line, of course. But people slip up and especially if this is how you behave outside of work, you've gotta expect an accident or two. Whats really gross is that you went straight to the rabid hyenas at HR rather than just, y'know, ironing it out with your lifelong friend. \n\nI mean, that's the end of the friendship. He slips up and embarrasses you, so you coldly toss him to dogs.

This is a fat nothing burger that OP turned into a real issue.", "Who\u2019s Andrew Tate?", "NTA", "Not to mention he was saying that to his friends' girlfriend. Makes it even more inappropriate imo.", "Why would written warning be necessary? Like not making sexual innuendo/remarks in a professional setting (unless possibly your work in a sex toy store but that is not the case here) is not something that needs explaining to any adult who is capable of holding down a job.", "Well *maybe* don't blame victims of sexual harassment for how they handle it, and you won't have any problem with people arguing with you", "I just added in the edit. Thank you.", "It was wildly inappropriate in a professional setting.", "Wow, your options really do suck, you are clearly a man, I'm guessing from the southern US or Midwest? It's not a \"funny joke\", it's sexual harassment because it's rude and demeaning. You've clearly never been in a management position before because when one of the two parties involved ARE management, that changes her response. This woman is clearly good at her job and knows how to people manage effectively because she did the thing you are supposed to do.\nEdit: it's really common for misogynistic men to claim sexual harassment is a \"joke\" in attempt to gaslight them into thinking they did something wrong. That's like sexually harassment 101.", "A fellow misogynist like yourself", "How did I blame OP?", "No problem! I know some ppl have friends that often joke like that but even if that were your type of friendship, it still doesn\u2019t excuse his behavior. I just think ppl will be more fair to you if they know that this type of joking isn\u2019t even a part of your friendship in general. NTA btw, of course.", "Oh you\u2019re a \u2026ist labelling type. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "By saying she could have handled it better", "Saying that maybe it could have been handled differently is not attributing blame. \n\nI dont work there and I didnt witness this harassment. Did you?", "It absolutely is a assigning blame. If you read this post, and your takeaway was, maybe she could have handled this better, I'm sorry to say super king, but that's blaming somebody for not handling sexual harassment the way you think they should. If she didn't even handle it the wrong way, she took it, and then reported it to HR. So I don't understand what your comment is about. It comes off as blaming her. If you don't think she handled it the wrong way, then don't put that statement in your comment."]}
