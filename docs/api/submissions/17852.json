I'm finally getting married in two months time (\ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc83) after a year of planning and everything has been going to plan so far with no hiccups. That was until my mother called me earlier in the week to ask me to postpone my wedding by at least a month. My sister is currently pregnant and her due date is July 17th. My sister asked my mother to be there for her for the whole of July since the due date is just an estimate and this is her first baby. Long story short, the father of her child is my ex boyfriend- whom she was sleeping with while we were dating. So we don't have a relationship with one another. I'm not willing to postpone my wedding for my sister and I told my mother that and also that she just simply needed to choose who she wanted to support. She's been fence-sitting and that's why we're here. She says I'm forcing her to make an impossible decision and my aunts are also trying to convince me to postpone.\r  \n\r  \nDon't get me wrong, I know she's also mom's child and wants her there for her but I also want her there for me and i've already waited a year for this and everything is already planned.

She can either make it or not. You have a venue and vendors and your spouse's entire side lined up. \n\nYour sister wants you to inconvenience ALL OF THEM in order to have your mother with her FOR \"AT LEAST A MONTH\"? Don't make me laugh. Your sister and her issues sound like they could fill a psychologists' convention for a month.\n\nI'd let your mother know that everything has been booked, for a long time. Be very very very nice. Tell her you are so sorry that the dates don't work for her, and will be happy to show her pictures when she's able. Be extra sweet, do NOT rise to the bait and do NOT lose your temper. \n\nGet a couple of sentences you can say \"So sorry it won't work for you, we've had everything booked\" or \"We have such a large group and this was the date we had decided on long ago\", etc. etc.", "NTA feels like a power play by your sister. This could of been asked 6 months ago when it wouldn\u2019t of been such a big deal. I\u2019m sure she can cope for one day with out mum", "NTA.  You're only asking for a day, not a whole month.  Expecting you reschedule everything and everybody is pretty unreasonable.  The child probably won't even arrive on the same day.", "Don\u2019t for a second even consider postponing. Sounds like your sister is devoted to ruining everything in your life that she can. That seems like a deep rooted psychological problem or just pure evil. \n\nYour mother can make her own decision. You don\u2019t specify how she reacted to your sister\u2019s betrayal. But you should celebrate your happy marriage with people who want to be there for you. \n\nObviously NTA for refusing to postpone.", "NTA. Insensitive request from your mother and aunts.", "NTA ! So sorry you\u2019re in this predicament. I too have a sh*tty sister who pulls stuff like this.

It's unreasonable to wait this late to ask to postpone. Your mother can spare one day. \n\nI'd make an offer though, if they are serious about postponing.  They have to pay the full cost of the loss of the deposits,  an inconvenience fee, and the full cost of rebooting the wedding.  They have until 5 pm Monday to have the full amount in cash delivered to you.", "NTA it\u2019s too difficult to postpone weddings for a myriad of reasons. Your mum is either there or not.

Your sister is the one selfish and entitled enough to think she gets to have your moms attention for the whole month.\n\nTell your mom she needs to make a choice. You will not postpone the wedding. If she choices your sister then your relationship will be forever changed. Your not forcing her to choice. You are asking for one day. Your sister is being entitled, spoiled and greedy for demanding a whole freaking month but then again what can you expect from someone who sleeps with their sisters boyfriend!", "NTA. Your sister is the ah for sleeping with your boyfriend. Your mom can go to your wedding it is one day then come back to help sister.

I'd also consider putting her in time out for a while.", "Lol NTA but your mom and sister are", "NTA. You've been planning the wedding for a year.

I'm assuming that you haven't broken up with him after finding she was sleeping with him, met someone else, and made plans to marry in under six months?\n\nIN/FO: how much physical distance is there between you and her - would your mother be able to come to your wedding and return home (or to near your sister) without much difficulty?\n\nedit: I requested more info, on the back of that, I'm convinced NTA. This feels like sister trying to throw a spanner in the works at a time when it's not monstrously disruptive for your mother to alter travel plans, but hugely disruptive for your wedding. She screwed you over (literally) with your ex - feels very much like a time to say sorry but I'm not prepared to upend my life for her again.", "NTA. I was expecting to go the other way until I got to the part where your ex is the baby daddy. Babies come when they come whereas weddings can be changed. But you don\u2019t owe your sister anything.", "NTA. Hold your ground. You planned this out and its insult to injury to postpone this for someone, especially a sister, who went behind your back with your then boyfriend. \n\nI understand your moms at a crossroad, but I wouldn\u2019t necessarily hold it against her. But to your credit - you have the date confirmed. Your sister doesnt even know the specified date. the least your mom can do is understand where youre coming from and be with you for the wedding then go to your sister.", "I feel like this story was posted a week or so ago...", "NTA-  Live your life with the people that love you,hon.\n\nYour mom made her choice a long time ago when she decided to support your cheating sister in any shape way or form after she betrayed you like that.\n\n\nLet her have her time with her grand baby because we both know THAT IS ALREADY MORE IMPORTANT TO HER Since she has the gall to ask you to postpone your wedding for your poor excuse of a sister .\n\n\nCongratulations on your big day, your mom doesn\u2019t deserve to be there anyway.", "NTA and your sister sounds awful", "NTA  she can't leave your sister  for a day to be at your wedding ??\n\nYour wedding  has been planned and paid for.  Postpone a couple of months ??\nThat's stupid.\n\n she wants to be with sister,   tell her thanks for the heads up so you can adjust table seating.\nDon't  tell her it's  okay,  because it's not", "NTA. Although it is a tuff situation. How far away does your sister live? Would it possible for your mother to travel to your wedding for one or maybe two days but still be with your sister the rest of the month? \n\nIt is really a bad situation for your mother and yourself. And maybe your sister, but if she has her husband at her side, I don't see why she would need her mother there all the time (exept if it is a cultural or traditional reason).\n\nBut postpone a wedding is expensive and most likly that not everyone will be avalibe then, especial, if it is during holiday season. Maybe try to talk to your mother, and if there is any change your sister will be reasonable also with her, if there is a solution - like the one mentioned before or something else. \n\nINFO: could it be, that your sister activly tries to keep your mother from your wedding, by beeing more important because of the future grandchild and 'I need help the whole month'-thingi?", "NTA\n\nA wedding involves lots of moving parts.

And should have made it before now - she\u2019s had enough notice of both, right?\n\nDon\u2019t yell at her or express frustration or she\u2019ll make you the bad guy. Just restate the wedding date and say that while you hope she\u2019ll be there to support you, you\u2019ll show her pictures afterward if she can\u2019t. Say the same words every time, to everyone who brings it up. \n\nSave any anger and ensuing fallout for afterwards.\n\nI hope you have a wonderful wedding day and a long and happy marriage, OP.", "NTA, I think your mother and aunts are terrible saying that to you, especially when they know what your sister did. As for your sister... what a disgusting pig! I hope your in-laws are the family you deserve, and you can ditch the lot you're biologically attached to!!!", "NTA - but expect that even if you do postpone, your sister would say she\u2019s need your mom. She\u2019s been horrible to you and continuing that by trying to make your mom choose with an unreasonable request.", "NTA absolutely do not change your wedding date. It will cost you a fortune in fees and cancellations, and I assume everyone else has been invited and made their arrangements to come. \nYour sister is trying to monopolize your mom in an effort to hurt you, don\u2019t let her. If your mom can\u2019t be there at your wedding, say you\u2019re very sorry to hear that, and have a great time anyway.

NTA, sister got issues, horrible situation all round and I genuinely feel for your mum, she's stuck between a rock and a hard place, whatever you do, go easy on her, and be nice as pie about it all if you can (her lack of involvement in your wedding) because you know she'll be hurting about it m", "ESH You've been planning this wedding longer than she's been pregnant and will incur costs at this stage if you delay. It is unfortunate the clash but it is what it is. You have other guests and suppliers to consider.\n\nBut your Mum is in a very hard situation. You say she is fence-sitting about a situation where you have the right to be angry at your sister. But she has two daughters both needing her. Her decision will likely be based on need not want. And you are likely to lose. Daughter on own with baby coming or daughter marrying into another support network. If that is her choice, try not to blame her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
