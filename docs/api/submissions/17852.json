It is not the entire month of July that Entitled Sis wants to monopolize Mom's time.", "Oh I love it! Do it, OP!", "LOVE THIS", "I wouldnt be surprise if sister planned this pregnancy just to ruin the wedding", "Yep AFTER she even fucked her boyfriend!", "Nope, OP's mom would probably let sister attend virtually with her.", "I love Zoom weddings as it was how I got to take parent in my cousin's wedding in 2020, when all 4 parents were unable to travel to be physically present. However, I feel awkward suggesting this because it's not a global pandemic outbreak preventing the mom from attending but rather an estranged sister demanding the mother to be present the entire month surrounding her due date.", "I was just thinking this. Sister sounds like she would absolutely do this to OP.", "Then say \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t let me choose a different date!", "Exactly! The mother can figure this out. And it is telling that the mother does not appear to be trying and only is asking OP to shift. Does the mother always support the sister in all things? Sorry that OP has to go through this.", "Getting rid of dead weight is so freeing! I\u2019ve cut out 98% of my dad\u2019s side. They supported me being abused for my entire childhood, then were wondering why I was struggling as an adult. I feel incredibly fortunate to have had the clarity at 25 to start to let them go. I gave them to redemptive chance, they failed to rise to the occasion. Uh buh byeeee \ud83d\udc4b Don\u2019t let the door hit you on the way out. Family are those who care about you and your well-being. Same for friends.", "Are they still together?", "My favorite saying is I can burn that bridge I know how to swim. Op needs to take this stand with her family", "so how is OP's the AH then", "With her ex", "Yup! She slept with her sister's ex partner when they were together, Mom/family is apparently supporting the cheater sister, and so the sister knew exactly what she was doing as a power play just to f-with her sister. Mom is not in an impossible situation. Mom is \\*choosing to support her adulterer child over her other one\\*. So, handle that how you will.", "This. Banged her older sister's boyfriend when they were still together, and is popping out a show stealer at just the right time..  telling mommy dearest, she has to ignore her other daughters wedding to stay with her for the entire month!!", "He\u2019ll probably be fucking her best friend that day.", "That's what my first thought was. 100% she is doing this deliberately and mom is foolishly playing into it.", "Mom is not going to turn her back on her child or grandchild for that matter because she\u2019s a cheater. Its an unfortunate situation, and she should absolutely not postpone her wedding. NTA.", "Or..... sister will start having \"labor pains\" right when the wedding starts, so mother has to rush her to the hospital.  Only to find out they were Braxton Hicks contractions and the baby is still a week or more away.", "I got married in 2016  in the middle of a blizzard! Why? Because \u201cjust postponing\u201d was too expensive and impractical.", "Not OP, the person whose comment I replied to. OP is obviously NTA.", "Her sister made a terrible mistake. Yes. OP is now happily engaged and getting married. Why is she holding a grudge? Her life worked out for the best. It's called being a bigger person. She doesn't need to change her wedding, but the entire family needs to learn the words forgiveness and compromise. There is a middle ground here.", "Its not clear. Odd that OP would be with the ex then, and meet and make wedding plans that quickly.", "Sad", "Here, have an upvote.", "She doesn't need to be away at the sisters a whole month....she would prolly give birth the month after anyway.  I don't get why the mom can't just take one day away from her precious cheating backstabbing daughter to also see her other daughter get married...besides if mom choosing the sister, don't let her be there for your children.", "It\u2019s a 12 hour drive and mom refuses to fly. It\u2019s not clear how soon the due date is and the wedding date. It\u2019s her first baby, and baby can come at any time. My mother lives out of town and I have requested she be here for the month before I give birth because the baby can come at any time. It would be different if they lived in the same town. It\u2019s a tough situation for mom to be in no doubt."]}
