Children's interests ebb and flow so much, and year-to-year their other responsibilities change (e.g. school demands, navigating growing up). I honestly think any parent adopting a pet \"for\" a child has to understand that ultimately the animal is that parent's responsibility.

No - but I am an adult who wanted a dog \n\nAs a teenager I hated walking my dog even though I loved him.

Dogs need a lot of attention and interaction. \n\nGood for you for this.", "Personally, I think your requirements are a bit too high.  You are requiring three people to take collectively walk six miles a day.  That can be overkill for some dogs, plus it doesn't give them the \"fun\" exercise time of running around in the backyard, playing catch, etc.\n\nYou also require them to do a job of collecting garbage which is completely different from feeding an animal.  Your also saying your two oldest kids, which implies there are more than two, but no concept of the ages of them.  In my household, we have cats, not dogs, but I have had dogs in the past.  My three year old is the one who has claimed the responsibility of getting the dry food and filling the bowl.  My five year old refills the water.  I didn't make them do these things, they love taking care of an animals and do this every day.   I also can't get them to do anything with the garbage.\n\nAll of that being said, I really wish I could vote differently, but I have to vote NTA.  You don't want the responsibility and set rules for them to follow that they agreed to.  They failed to meet the requirements they agreed to, which means they lose.  I still think your rules are too strict against actual ownership of an animal, but that doesn't mean there isn't responsibility and they need to own that.  A compromise, if you actually would be willing to have a dog, is to find a breed that matches the cadence of your family.  Your husband, however, should have had these conversations with you BEFORE involving two kids and siding with them.  So still, you're not the asshole.", "Not going to lie.

It\u2019s much harder to stick with it for 6 months. A dog requires years and years. I think it\u2019s fair.", "It's kind of funny.  I've seen the kids have to drag their dad out for a walk in the morning and after work.", "There's no way you would be. True dog lovers want the dogs to be happy comfortable and cared for. The fact that the people who want the dog are not willing to step up and take care of the dog is the problem. You don't have a dog because you don't want a dog and that is completely fine.

I mean, as a kid, I remember my first dog, and that I had to take it for walks, and clean up the poop in the backyard, and feed it, etc.  Most of it wasn't a chore to me because I had a bond with that dog and I loved him.  I guarantee that I would have failed OP's test at the time, but I passed dog ownership with flying colors for over a decade with that dog.  That said, my parents still had to schedule vet appointments and manage that, and buy and pay for the food, so it was never 100% my responsibility.  A dad and two kids should be able to handle it though.  There is no chance OP would have zero responsibility though, so I can respect the challenge, I just don't think it really equates to have it works in the real world.", "Can't say I'm surprised - the kids likely were more excited about getting the dog but less likely to sustain the actions without support from a parent ... having to motivate the parent essentially doomed them ... not in a bad way, but as a reality check.

I got downvoted for saying something I didn't think.was rude or contraversial.", "That's depressing :-/", "My husband and I did this with our 9-year-old who wanted her \"own\" cat. We already had a cat, and dogs, but we discussed that she may be taking this cat with her when she's an adult and needs to prove that she can also care for it properly. She had a 3 month checklist of chores to complete: helping with the current cat's litter box, feeding the animals, etc. At the end of 3 months she wasn't even close and had to start all over.

I\u2019d also do 40 or 45 days; that\u2019s about how long they say it takes to build a habit so it\u2019s a good stretch of time to go for.

It'll be a lot of work for you esp in the beginning getting used to it. It sounds like your husband is willing to help, though you'll probably do most and have to get on his case - same with the kids. But it's one of the best ways IMO to teach kids responsibility. You can't shirk it like taking out the trash because it's a living thing. It has to eat, it has to go out, it has to exercise, it has to have structure and be disciplined. You'll definitely have to do work taking care of the dog and being the family leader to get help. You aren't up for that and you know it, but more often than not if the family really wants a dog, you'll get more help than you think. Kids and dogs have a crazy bond so the reward of taking care of the dog is that love and makes it less of a chore.", "I would say half AH, you were right to set boundaries but you took it to the extreme. How you responded to the in-laws was perfect though.

Collecting all the garbage in the house and taking it outside likely takes a lot longer than feeding a dog.  It takes like 15 seconds to feed my 2 dogs and make sure the water bowl is full.  And there\u2019s no way they\u2019re letting anyone forget it\u2019s meal time!  Also 2 separate mile walks is  a task for sure without a dog.

As a dog owner/lover, I\u2019ve seen too many people not -really- understand the time it takes. I walk twice a day everyday (unless boyfriend takes a turn), he needs food and water everyday, and you need to keep track of shots/preventative care. That doesn\u2019t even take into account training, play time, guarding your stuff against chewing, picking up poop, etc. \ud83d\ude02\n\nHowever, making your husband talk to your kids alone is kind of petty.

I wouldn\u2019t say much if I were you, but at least sit with him when he tells them.", "NTA.\n\nThough I do think that your terms were a bit overly strict and could have offered some compromise. For example, there are plenty of small breed dogs that don't need multiple mile long walks per day (my parent's senior dachshund is a lazy weiner, these days I *drive* him to the park when I pet-sit because he tuckers out if we try to walk there). And likewise, instead of requiring a hairless breed they could have demonstrated their willingness to vacuum every 2-3 days or something.\n\nBut that's also something *they* could offer. You know, like \"maybe we could adopt an older dog that doesn't need as much exercise? Could we show we can clean up after the dog instead of needing a hairless one?\" The fact they didn't think to do that suggests they're enamored with the fantasy of a dog instead of the reality of one.", "YTA.\n\nYou seem to think that your children's attitudes and work ethics somehow have nothing to do with you.

I can't be waking up every 2 hours to take a puppy out, to house train a puppy, and to make sure they don't chew their way through my home. He always gets sad when we talk about it, kind of making me feel guilty because I refuse to sacrifice what little sleep I get to begin with to take care of an animal like this. It wouldn't be healthy for the dog, or for myself, and I refuse to make that commitment simply because he misses his old dog who passed away years before we even met.

So we got another cat at his request with the understand we were to split the duties equally. That lasted a week. My family cat wasn\u2019t well and We had to put him down 2 years ago.

He's also going blind and cant always see if he is stepping into poop. A couple times a month I have to steam clean every carpet in the house because he stepped in doodoo and ran around everywhere afterwards. Nothing like getting off work and finding every carpet covered covered in poo prints.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on puppies. Absolute nightmares for essentially the first two years of their life. They may be cute but its like living with a moody tornado.\n\nPeople always underestimate how much work you need to put into a dog to end up with a well adjusted, well behaved family member.", "Our dog tried to make friends with skunk. She then had the nerve to look offended when we bathed her.", "My toy eskies had long hair, and poop would stick from time to time.  You know you love dogs when you have one tucked under your arm at 2 am, butt over the utility sink, washing crap off their hiney.\n\nOr my personal favorite, 2 am skunk showers because your 45 lb dog thinks skunks are the funnest toys EVER!", "I have a lovely 11 year old lab who I adore. And because I'm a single woman with a job and a limp (not bad but still) I pay upwards of $800 a month to make sure that my lab is taken on long hikes and not bored while I'm earning a living so she can live the luxury life I'd like to become accustomed to :-) \n\nMy point-if you aren't going to be able to take care of your wonderful dog it's an expensive proposition", "We have a greyhound-very short coat and no undercoat. Every day I ask him where he is hiding his German Shepherd friend; he sheds that much!", "Borrow a dog!  If you have a friendly neighbor/local friend/family member with a friendly dog, go on a few walks with them to learn how to walk their dog.  And offer to do solo walks when you\u2019re comfortable.\n\nMost dogs are happy to be walked.  If you like the dog, making it happy motivates you to walk more.\n\nI don\u2019t want a dog, they\u2019re far too needy.\n\nBut I happily offer to walk my parents dog as needed or when they\u2019re doing things and can\u2019t bring him along.  I walked for 45 minutes yesterday just because he loved sniffing all the things at the park so much.  I\u2019d not have set foot outside my house without that encouragement.\n\nAnd yeah, aim for at least 2 miles daily.  When my parents dog was younger, unless he had an acre or two to run around on he needed at Least an hour and a half of active walking pretty fast per day to get some exercise at my place.  When I was babysitting him in my apartment it was wake up, 30 minute fast walk/breakfast/15 minute sniff and pee and poop walk right before leaving for work/(dogwalker lunch break if long work day)/30 minute fast walk after getting home from work/dinner/30 minute evening long slower walk/pee break right before bed.\n\nAnd he\u2019s just a goldendoodle, not something really overactive like a border collie or husky.\n\nGranted, he needed more walking than a Yorkie or English bulldog or whatever.  But it\u2019s a Lot easier with multiple people to switch off.", "A mile or two is good to be prepared for that type of need but not every dog needs that. \n\nI had a high energy dog and throwing the ball for 20-30mins was good enough. Of course she would want to do it longer but over time that wasn't good for her body.", "My dog runs 5 miles a day and walks 2 miles in addition to that. He also plays fetch for 30 min a day on days he doesn\u2019t run (maybe once or twice a week). He is 7 years old and not slowing down. People think he\u2019s a puppy because of how healthy he is. Most dogs do not get nearly enough exercise and it is so sad.", "One thing you have to remember, is you have to take the dog out in ALL weather. Rain and snow. So you have to walk the dog for a mile in those weathers. I have a dog and I live in a very snowy state and I hate taking her out in the middle of the night (when i get home from work) during a snow storm. Me and my bf have a deal that if we both don't want to take her out, for whatever reason, we both then have to take her out together. That way there's no resentment about 1 of us being forced to do it.", "This is a great solution because not only did your kids learn a lot, also the rescue place got some assistance!", "Lmaoooo just like owning a dog, \"what do you mean you don't want to go out, I have work now and in 30 minutes you'll want to go out\"", "Stellar reply!", "I've gone on walks with them.  It's harder because we have a baby in a stroller.", "Puppies not only need to go out more than twice, but usually can\u2019t do a whole mile at once!

A basic shorthair with no undercoat is going to be much easier to deal with. Deshedding shampoo and a good, thorough brush out at the end of winter and then weekly brushing/regular bathing would be easy enough.", "I've got 2 Aussies and the one that had surgery had diarrhea for almost 2 weeks after her surgery. She's well potty trained so she won't go inside unless she has no other option, so it resulted in multiple 30ish minute walks 24/7 followed by gently hosing her off in the tub. I love her to bits but the unintentional sleep torture made me have a nervous breakdown. Things would've been 1000x worse if it was a dog I never wanted and was forced to care for", "We have had two keeshonden and loved them! Not many know about them.", "As a side note to wanting one that doesn't shed,  the not shedding comes at the expense of a LOT of grooming or bathing (looking at you doodles). But NTA. If they really wanted a dog they'd do this", "Thanks, will do. I work from home so I don't think I would need a dog walker.", "That's a good point. If you are an adult person ready for the responsibilities but not entirely up to the walking, having A Dog for a bit can make training more fun. And it builds up relationships for if you get one yourself.", "Oof. That would be an awful situation for a bunny. I had a cat that used to festoon our front porch with bunny bits every Spring, even when she was 17 years old. That cat was a force to be reckoned with.", "AITA is kind of weird. In some threads, people get so invested in stuff like petty revenge that they start downvoting people who don't argue for the most dramatic, escalating resolution to whatever OP's problem is.", "I asked once since I genuinely didn't understand how I was being uncivil.  They sent me a link to the rules that I had already read and never actually told me what I did wrong.

If you've got an off leash dog park or trails near you, that can help immensely. So can teaching then to run alongside a bike.  Smaller dogs are also good with shorter walks, or you even could keep an eye out for an overweight dog that needs to work up to longer walks along with you.", "You\u2019ll Want one.  Not daily, but it\u2019s a type of relationship you need.  As well as a vet and a boarding kennel.\n\nYou want to have an occasional walker/boarding place already vetted that you trust with your dog (and your house access) for the inevitable minor or major catastrophe where you can\u2019t be home for 10 hours for some reason.  Kennels often need temperament tests and vet records for daycare or boarding.  Can\u2019t do that last minute in an emergency.\n\nYou\u2019ll have a car accident, emergency gallbladder surgery, sister is eloping and wants you to witness the wedding, you sprained an ankle and can\u2019t do walks for a few days, family member needs help, you lose your job or need to work in person for some other reason, whatever.", "Are we talking about walks for exercise, or to go potty?", "Also Scandinavian. My dog got 20 min walk before work, 45 min to an hour after work, and 30-45 min before bed, with some play inbetween. But it also depends alot on the breed. I'm going for a pretty active sheepherder next time and I expect it to need more physical exercise in the morning and middle of the day.", "There are many factors to consider. Age, energy level, access to a yard/play area, etc. It's not one-walk-fits-all.", "Most Americans have yards that dog does thier business and some light exercise. Walks are pretty much just for exercise.", "I asked twice.

I also might just go to a shelter to pick whatever dog wants me. The shelter might be a bad idea though, I might end up with 2, lol. I definitely don't want that.", "I will check into these. When I get my dog, I want to be well prepared. Thanks again.", "Yes thank you! Idk why im getting downvoted so much and why so many people think im insane for going on 3 walks \ud83e\udd72 Literally everyone does that in Finland.", "If it is a Border Collie it will need sheep. Or if you can't do that, agility, and lots of it. I worked German Shepherds on other people's sheep for many years, got asked to try a BC pup on sheep once because I was known to have patience, and boy HOWDY! First time that little dog saw sheep, and she moved them just the way I wanted her to before I consciously gave her any cues. I thought, go left, she ran around to their left. Her owner did plan to do agility with her, and was just curious if she had herding instinct, but I always thought how sad that she could not be a working sheep dog. It was not nearly just her need for exercise, it was her need to problem solve.", "I was having lunch a bit ago, and out of morbid curiosity, the first channel I clicked on was Judge Judy.  OMG!!!!", "...as will studying cognition", "Well, you do have two hands \ud83d\ude1c", "I would advise against a German Sheppard as a first time dog if you are having difficulty with the athletic portion of dog ownership; they require a LOT of exercise. German Sheppards specifically are surrendered a lot due to this, and also bc when they have issues (resource guarding, being overprotective, reactivity) they become BIG problems bc they are big and strong and intimidating. They're great dogs, but you have to know what you're getting into imo.", "Does your dog have access to a yard? I think the typical American with a dog situation includes a fenced yard with a dog accessible door, so the dog can take itself outside to run around, and people throw a ball for the dog in the yard. People who live in cities and don\u2019t have yards generally do  before and after work and before bed (or pay a dog walker to take the dog out midday) but in rural and suburban America the assumption is that the dog has free access to a yard."]}
