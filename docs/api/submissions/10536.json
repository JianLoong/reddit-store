Children's interests ebb and flow so much, and year-to-year their other responsibilities change (e.g. school demands, navigating growing up). I honestly think any parent adopting a pet \"for\" a child has to understand that ultimately the animal is that parent's responsibility.

No - but I am an adult who wanted a dog \n\nAs a teenager I hated walking my dog even though I loved him.

Dogs need a lot of attention and interaction. \n\nGood for you for this.", "Personally, I think your requirements are a bit too high.  You are requiring three people to take collectively walk six miles a day.  That can be overkill for some dogs, plus it doesn't give them the \"fun\" exercise time of running around in the backyard, playing catch, etc.\n\nYou also require them to do a job of collecting garbage which is completely different from feeding an animal.  Your also saying your two oldest kids, which implies there are more than two, but no concept of the ages of them.  In my household, we have cats, not dogs, but I have had dogs in the past.  My three year old is the one who has claimed the responsibility of getting the dry food and filling the bowl.  My five year old refills the water.  I didn't make them do these things, they love taking care of an animals and do this every day.   I also can't get them to do anything with the garbage.\n\nAll of that being said, I really wish I could vote differently, but I have to vote NTA.  You don't want the responsibility and set rules for them to follow that they agreed to.  They failed to meet the requirements they agreed to, which means they lose.  I still think your rules are too strict against actual ownership of an animal, but that doesn't mean there isn't responsibility and they need to own that.  A compromise, if you actually would be willing to have a dog, is to find a breed that matches the cadence of your family.  Your husband, however, should have had these conversations with you BEFORE involving two kids and siding with them.  So still, you're not the asshole.", "Not going to lie.

It\u2019s much harder to stick with it for 6 months. A dog requires years and years. I think it\u2019s fair.", "It's kind of funny.  I've seen the kids have to drag their dad out for a walk in the morning and after work.", "There's no way you would be. True dog lovers want the dogs to be happy comfortable and cared for. The fact that the people who want the dog are not willing to step up and take care of the dog is the problem. You don't have a dog because you don't want a dog and that is completely fine.

I mean, as a kid, I remember my first dog, and that I had to take it for walks, and clean up the poop in the backyard, and feed it, etc.  Most of it wasn't a chore to me because I had a bond with that dog and I loved him.  I guarantee that I would have failed OP's test at the time, but I passed dog ownership with flying colors for over a decade with that dog.  That said, my parents still had to schedule vet appointments and manage that, and buy and pay for the food, so it was never 100% my responsibility.  A dad and two kids should be able to handle it though.  There is no chance OP would have zero responsibility though, so I can respect the challenge, I just don't think it really equates to have it works in the real world.", "Can't say I'm surprised - the kids likely were more excited about getting the dog but less likely to sustain the actions without support from a parent ... having to motivate the parent essentially doomed them ... not in a bad way, but as a reality check.

I got downvoted for saying something I didn't think.was rude or contraversial.", "That's depressing :-/", "My husband and I did this with our 9-year-old who wanted her \"own\" cat. We already had a cat, and dogs, but we discussed that she may be taking this cat with her when she's an adult and needs to prove that she can also care for it properly. She had a 3 month checklist of chores to complete: helping with the current cat's litter box, feeding the animals, etc. At the end of 3 months she wasn't even close and had to start all over.

Not all three of them need to go on a dog walk every time.

I\u2019d also do 40 or 45 days; that\u2019s about how long they say it takes to build a habit so it\u2019s a good stretch of time to go for.

It'll be a lot of work for you esp in the beginning getting used to it. It sounds like your husband is willing to help, though you'll probably do most and have to get on his case - same with the kids. But it's one of the best ways IMO to teach kids responsibility. You can't shirk it like taking out the trash because it's a living thing. It has to eat, it has to go out, it has to exercise, it has to have structure and be disciplined. You'll definitely have to do work taking care of the dog and being the family leader to get help. You aren't up for that and you know it, but more often than not if the family really wants a dog, you'll get more help than you think. Kids and dogs have a crazy bond so the reward of taking care of the dog is that love and makes it less of a chore.", "I would say half AH, you were right to set boundaries but you took it to the extreme. How you responded to the in-laws was perfect though.

Collecting all the garbage in the house and taking it outside likely takes a lot longer than feeding a dog.  It takes like 15 seconds to feed my 2 dogs and make sure the water bowl is full.  And there\u2019s no way they\u2019re letting anyone forget it\u2019s meal time!  Also 2 separate mile walks is  a task for sure without a dog.

As a dog owner/lover, I\u2019ve seen too many people not -really- understand the time it takes. I walk twice a day everyday (unless boyfriend takes a turn), he needs food and water everyday, and you need to keep track of shots/preventative care. That doesn\u2019t even take into account training, play time, guarding your stuff against chewing, picking up poop, etc. \ud83d\ude02\n\nHowever, making your husband talk to your kids alone is kind of petty.

I wouldn\u2019t say much if I were you, but at least sit with him when he tells them.", "NTA.\n\nThough I do think that your terms were a bit overly strict and could have offered some compromise. For example, there are plenty of small breed dogs that don't need multiple mile long walks per day (my parent's senior dachshund is a lazy weiner, these days I *drive* him to the park when I pet-sit because he tuckers out if we try to walk there). And likewise, instead of requiring a hairless breed they could have demonstrated their willingness to vacuum every 2-3 days or something.\n\nBut that's also something *they* could offer. You know, like \"maybe we could adopt an older dog that doesn't need as much exercise? Could we show we can clean up after the dog instead of needing a hairless one?\" The fact they didn't think to do that suggests they're enamored with the fantasy of a dog instead of the reality of one.", "YTA.\n\nYou seem to think that your children's attitudes and work ethics somehow have nothing to do with you.

I fully understand the requirements with owning a dog, and this test doesn't even include the possibility that there is a disobedient dog that requires additional training or special routines for anything.  All I'm saying is that kids tend to rise to these kind of challenges vs something like collecting trash or doing dishes.\n\nI shared my current experience with cats because I have young children that, by their own doing, have involved themselves in caring for our cats.  We don't know OP's children's ages.  My five year old could not care for a dog, but myself at ten could.  At fifteen, a kid can, but I would be concerned about them not wanting to put the work in, but again, it all depends on the kid.  Personally, I think pet ownership is a good experience for kids as it helps teach responsibility, empathy, and respect, but I would not force that on every family.\n\nIt's clear OP doesn't want a dog or responsibility.  There is no way a dog can exist in that house where she won't have some level of responsibility, even something as simple as making sure you don't leave a door open.\n\nI'm even stating she's not the asshole here, her husband is 100% for not doing this behind closed doors before siding with two kids.  I just think if she doesn't want a dog she should just say it, instead of hiding it behind the game of responsibility which I just don't agree with.  If doing so would somehow make her the bad guy, then again, that's 100% her husband's fault.", "I do! I\u2019ve had a dog on my own for the past 6 years.

If you don\u2019t want a dog and you will refuse to do anything for a dog brought into the house, then yeah YWBTA. \nA dog is a member of the house, and while your husband and kids should be the main caregivers, if you want no part of the dog, then yeah you need to say that out loud and absolutely ban a dog in the house no matter how responsible your kids and husband are, and you need to own that to your kids.", "Agreed, NTA.

If you ever had a dog you know it is pretty much impossible to go a day without feeding it, everyone would know.  Same thing with walks/bathroom/playtime.
