This was brilliant planning", "NTA. A+ parenting and life lessoning!", "NTA. AITA is literally full of posts about people taking care of pets they didn't want.  Dogs are a long term commitment. Has your husband taken into account that your kids will be in school, extracurriculars, dating, etc. Depending on how old your kids are they may even move out. Who will be taking care of the dog then?", "NTA - Even though every step along the way was pushing the fuzzy border of Asshole-dom, I'm giving you N-T-A clearance on this.  Most people don't understand the responsibility required to own a dog.  Many dogs are neglected and mistreated because of it.  And often the responsibility for preventing those things from happening falls on the most responsible member of the household, which sounds like you.  Only thing I'll add is this: give them another chance.  People can learn discipline and change.", "NTA this was smart and prevented the possibility of a dog being neglected and rehomed in the future. Love how you handled the grandparents too!", "NTA and great tactic to show them the responsibility that comes with a pet. Also, beautifully handled with the grandparents. Watch out, I could see grandparents buying someone a dog for a birthday..", "NTA. I don't even think what you did was petty. It seems like a reasonable way to determine if your kids are ready for the responsibility of having a dog, and your husband proved that he is not willing to make up for where they're lacking.  You absolutely would have had to look after the dog.\n\nYou already told the kids you don't think they should have a dog.  I don't know why you'd have to do it again.  They need to hear it from their dad too.", "Found this a really interesting read!\n\nLove the addition of household chores to mimic dog care responsibilities as a practice run.\n\nI do think dog walking would be a lot more motivating than walking without a dog, so I have some empathy for your kids for struggling to stick with that.\n\nI think a mistake a lot of people make is to adopt a pet that \"belongs\" to a child. Children's interests ebb and flow so much, and year-to-year their other responsibilities change (e.g. school demands, navigating growing up). I honestly think any parent adopting a pet \"for\" a child has to understand that ultimately the animal is that parent's responsibility. You were right to include your husband in this, OP.\n\nI reckon that these rules feel harsh as a reader, but ultimately you've protected a dog from being neglected or unnecessarily uprooted and rehomed. NTA, OP.", "NTA. \n\nWell done. \n\nYou wanted to be proven wrong, and you were proven right.\n\nYour family is not ready to be pet owners. And your grandparents adding their 2 cents, fair enough. If they can talk the talk, they can walk the walk.\n\nYou already said no. Your husband can add his now.", "NTA at all.\n\nI love my 2 dogs very much, but they\u2019re so much work. Picking up the dog poops from the garden when it\u2019s been raining for hours is a special kind of hell.\n\nYou\u2019re just trying to make them understand how much work is involved in having a dog. That can\u2019t be a bad thing. It\u2019s the truth.", "NTA every family that wants a dog should do that ... genius \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. You\u2019re not being petty.

Stand firm.", "NTA, I have seen this way to many times in my life, everyone wants the dog then no one wants to care for it so the only responsible person winds up doing all the animal care. And your husband needs to be the one to have the conversation with the kids and explain to them they are not ready to take on the responsibility of a dog and that has been proven, a good life lesson for sure.", "NTA.

You seem the be the only one considering what is good for the dog", "NTA - in the context of the question, but you make me smile with the way you laid out an absolutely petty yet objective test. If they wanted to - they would. And it shows very clearly that WAY too much would have fallen back onto you.", "NTA this is genius! Very good lesson for your kids too about learning the responsibility of life things without an actual living animal having to bear the weight of that lesson in missed walks / feeds etc", "NTA \n\nBeautifully done!", "NTA", "NTA, DON'T TELL THE KIDS, let your husband do it, don't take the fall and be the bad guy so he can be like \"oh no, mom said we can't get a dog, I have no say\" he can take responsibility for telling them they're not getting a dog.", "I stupidly showed this post to my wife.

Daughter is younger and I know most of looking after it will fall on me, the not a dog person at all. I know I\u2019ll likely be an our dog person, but we weren\u2019t getting a dog unless the current pet (hamster) ceased to be my pet by default, and wouldn\u2019t you know, I\u2019m no longer having to feed it every day (supervise he\u2019s been fed to make sure he\u2019s not being starved, but I\u2019m no longer the only one feeding him and cleaning his cage!). I\u2019ve said I don\u2019t want a dog (never had one), but if we do get one, I\u2019m his biggest advocate, no one is neglecting him on my watch (we\u2019ve decided a medium sized boy, but the hamster was supposed to be a short haired golden and he is not, he\u2019s a black and white long hair that looks like a little furry slipper). The difference is I know I\u2019ll be doing a lot of the looking after because my daughter is fairly young, but I think it\u2019s fair to make sure they\u2019re capable of doing what they can.", "NTA. I refused the dog request until I was ready for a dog because I KNEW I would be the one taking care of the dog.  Oh the promises\u2026the we will take care of the dog you won\u2019t even know! I stood my ground.  When I was ready we got the dog and everyone maintained they would show me\u2026.guess who takes care of the dog?? I can count on one hand the number of times they have even walked her in the last 3 years.", "Nope NTA! Taking on a dog is a huge responsibility! That helpless animal is 100% dependent on its owners. I own dogs myself, big dogs at that, and I\u2019ve had the same argument with my kids over cats. The novelty wears off after awhile and they think mom will just take on another chore. Nope, stick to your decision! And your right, your husband should be explaining this to the kids, not you. Be the asshole here to them if that\u2019s what it takes.", "NTA. Absolutely reasonable and very creative. Well done! \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "NTA if your open to helping/hiring someone in emergency situations. People get sick. People have to travel for work. \n\nWhile it\u2019s highly unlikely three people will all be unable to care for a pet, part of living in a family with animals is being okay in rare, one off situations to help out.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to do that then your no is a final NO and should be treated as such.\n\nOtherwise this sounds like a great way to both prepare the kids for a pet *and* get them outside.", "NTA\n\nI am a dog lover with a dog I adore - but he is a commitment. Some days if I\u2019m in pain due to some of my health issues I really don\u2019t want to walk him - I clean way more often (he drools on the couch) and all our plans now involve thinking about the dog \n\nDo I regret this? No - but I am an adult who wanted a dog \n\nAs a teenager I hated walking my dog even though I loved him. As a child I was no help with the dog. \n\nIf your husband was able to demonstrate he was meeting there it might be different but he wanted a dog and also has not demonstrated that he\u2019ll put in the effort - so I agree he should be the one speaking to them and saying look you didn\u2019t meet these requirements and neither did I so we can\u2019t have a dog", "NTA - We are dog lovers and our dog is a big part of our life, but a dog is a many year commitment and they do not deserve to be forgottten about or not taken proper care of.  Dogs need a lot of attention and interaction. \n\nGood for you for this.", "Personally, I think your requirements are a bit too high.  You are requiring three people to take collectively walk six miles a day.  That can be overkill for some dogs, plus it doesn't give them the \"fun\" exercise time of running around in the backyard, playing catch, etc.\n\nYou also require them to do a job of collecting garbage which is completely different from feeding an animal.  Your also saying your two oldest kids, which implies there are more than two, but no concept of the ages of them.  In my household, we have cats, not dogs, but I have had dogs in the past.  My three year old is the one who has claimed the responsibility of getting the dry food and filling the bowl.  My five year old refills the water.  I didn't make them do these things, they love taking care of an animals and do this every day.   I also can't get them to do anything with the garbage.\n\nAll of that being said, I really wish I could vote differently, but I have to vote NTA.  You don't want the responsibility and set rules for them to follow that they agreed to.  They failed to meet the requirements they agreed to, which means they lose.  I still think your rules are too strict against actual ownership of an animal, but that doesn't mean there isn't responsibility and they need to own that.  A compromise, if you actually would be willing to have a dog, is to find a breed that matches the cadence of your family.  Your husband, however, should have had these conversations with you BEFORE involving two kids and siding with them.  So still, you're not the asshole.", "Not going to lie. I got so many ideas from reading this sub.", "Sadly she also needed to parent her husband.", "I know. I usually comment in this sub using my main account but I was afraid of being downvoted into oblivion by dog lovers.", "They can try for sixty days as many times as they want.", "I would insist on the evidence of the service being set up before we could accept such a lovely gift.", "Poops in the rain \ud83d\ude2d our dog gets the runs due to digestive issues and I\u2019ve nearly thrown up trying to pick them up - had to invest in a little trowel just for scooping those ones", "You have sixty days, MichiganMainer! I believe in you!!", "LoL", "I think it\u2019s less about the type of work/amount and more of- can they stick to a consistent schedule once they have made a commitment. If the requirements to get the dog are a bit harder than the actual caring for the dog, then it shows they are ready for a dog! It\u2019s easy to do things for a month or two. It\u2019s much harder to stick with it for 6 months. A dog requires years and years. I think it\u2019s fair.", "It's kind of funny.  I've seen the kids have to drag their dad out for a walk in the morning and after work.", "There's no way you would be. True dog lovers want the dogs to be happy comfortable and cared for. The fact that the people who want the dog are not willing to step up and take care of the dog is the problem. You don't have a dog because you don't want a dog and that is completely fine. You also don't want to be sandbagged either which is even more fine.", "Not at all! As someone who has two dogs, I admire the fact that you challenged your family before taking on this huge responsibility that comes with having a dog. Too many times I\u2019ve seen on this sub animals having to be rehomed because their owners neglected them. Good for you \ud83d\udc4d", "That's  perfect!!!", "You need increase it to 3 walks a day though, (adult) dogs need 3-4 walks a day. Puppies need to be taken out like every 30min though...", "MichiganMainer can do it!!!", "I can understand that, but still, it's not quite an equal equation.  I mean, as a kid, I remember my first dog, and that I had to take it for walks, and clean up the poop in the backyard, and feed it, etc.  Most of it wasn't a chore to me because I had a bond with that dog and I loved him.  I guarantee that I would have failed OP's test at the time, but I passed dog ownership with flying colors for over a decade with that dog.  That said, my parents still had to schedule vet appointments and manage that, and buy and pay for the food, so it was never 100% my responsibility.  A dad and two kids should be able to handle it though.  There is no chance OP would have zero responsibility though, so I can respect the challenge, I just don't think it really equates to have it works in the real world.", "Can't say I'm surprised - the kids likely were more excited about getting the dog but less likely to sustain the actions without support from a parent ... having to motivate the parent essentially doomed them ... not in a bad way, but as a reality check.  Pet ownership can be very rewarding but it is a ton of work.", "You are probably right but I can understand her concern. People vote weird here sometimes.  I got downvoted for saying something I didn't think.was rude or contraversial.", "That's depressing :-/"]}
