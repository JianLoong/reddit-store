We were relocating from a big city and were unable to tour the home in person. We entrusted our parents and our realtor to do so and we \"toured\" via FaceTime. Our house is in a perfect location. It's in a walkable neighborhood (in a non-walkable city) close to downtown. There's a nice mix of residential homes and businesses. One of the things we liked about the location of the house is there are no neighbors behind or to the left of the house. The empty lot behind us is owned by one of the businesses close by and the lot to the left is owned by the city.\n\nA few months after the move, we learned there was a homeless man who slept in the empty lot to the left of us. He slept on a mattress under a tree on the other side of our fence. This didn't bother us. Again, we're from a big city and my spouse also works in housing and is sensitive to the issues of homeless people. This homeless man also wasn't there all the time, maybe 2-3x per week and mainly at night for sleep. We'd also see him around the neighborhood and have sparked up a couple conversations. During the winter, he vacated the space and a new couple took the spot. They're there all the time and they live in a tent. \n\nWe do spend a lot of time in our backyard because of our toddler and our energetic puppy. Often times, we have conversations around upcoming plans, etc. Because of the proximity to our home/fence, they are within earshot of our conversations. Even if they couldn't hear our conversation, being so close to our home they're able to pick up on patterns of when we're home or not. We have a trip coming up and we'll be away for a week and a half. I'm starting to feel a bit nervous about being away from our house for fear something could happen while we're gone. My husband thinks we should leave them alone, but I can't shake the feeling. We're not able to agree on what to do.

These are valid concerns. This is not the same as having a next door neighbor with a vested financial interest in the neighborhood who knows when you come and go. These are random people, likely trespassing depending on the ownership of that lot, with almost nothing to lose. It would be very easy for them to disappear with whatever they take if they actually wanted to rob you.\nAnd honestly, a little advice from someone who lives in a city with an overwhelming homeless problem - I would have the lot cleared either way. The fact that a new couple took the other guy\u2019s spot suggests that people feel comfortable camping out there. This is not something you want to encourage. We\u2019re going through this right now. The old tenant on our side of the duplex used to let people hang out on the porch, even put a free food box out. Now we\u2019re constantly having to chase junkies off the property. Literally caught one guy shooting up and one guy lighting a crack pipe within a week of each other. Like it or not, there are huge problems with drugs and mental health in the homeless community. These are not problems you want plopped on your doorstep, especially with young kids around.", "NTA.

You cannot do it based upon your anxiety around a future POSSIBLE reason.\n\nYou cannot action based on the anticipation of a crime.\n\nThat's just not ethical.", "I don't know the right answer. I personally think YTA. I hate that the police would get called on someone for sleeping on the ground outside. Maybe I'd do it if we were talking about my house.

It\u2019s a complicated issue as you want to help and be kind to people but if you feel in danger, that is hard to shake.  Call around to see if there is help for them also. Maybe they can qualify for shelter and other help.  Maybe an organization can stop by and talk to them. I\u2019d caution about getting too directly involved though as that can be a slippery slope.

If you're assuming someone is a criminal based on knowing one thing about them, that's not compassionate.", "If you don\u2019t want them evicted, than what do you realistically want to happen?", "I guess it\u2019s easy for people to virtue signal when it\u2019s not their home in question.", "You're correct that 10 years is to take over the property however 30 days and mail addressed to the property establish tenancy which means u have to legally evict which is several court dates.", "I agree with that, but once again that isn't really OP's fault. It's not the OP's fault that the state both creates the problem through idiotic legislation, and then tries to solve the problem by sending people with badges and guns who invariably exacerbate the problem.\n\nOP is worried about their home being broken into, and once again, while the scenarios I outlined are unlikely, they are possible.", ">I agree with that, but once again that isn't really OP's fault. It's not the OP's fault that the state both creates the problem through idiotic legislation, and then tries to solve the problem by sending people with badges and guns who invariably exacerbate the problem.\n\nthere is no scenario in which these people are able to claim squatter's rights. Your description here is completely inaccurate, and yet you're using it to justify calling the cops on poor, vulnerable people.", "They in no way implied they were less than anyone else. They simply state the true fact that these people have no stake in the neighborhood, it's quality, or it's people. They do not own any land that appreciates if the neighborhood stays nice, they do not have any true reason to stay and make bonds other than convenience of not finding a new tent spot, and OP is concerned about the classic \"the most dangerous person is someone with nothing to lose.\" \n\nA homeless person has nothing to lose, but a whole hell of a lot to gain. \n\nFinally, OP got to know the previous person who inhabited the lot, but clearly has not gotten to know this couple. You seriously blame OP for having reservations given these facts?", "What? The couple is literally committing the crime of trespassing if they don't have permission from the property owner.", ">Trespassing on an empty lot is a victimless crime.\n\nRight. Like I said. It is a crime.", "To clarify, I don't think all homeless people are criminals. I do think crime is driven by poverty and desperate situations. I've interacted with this couple and they seem like nice people. This is why it's so conflicting for me and I was looking for some outside thoughts.", "They are valid because they are hers. She gets to decide that, not you. Your neighbors are fellow property owners with a vested interest in protecting said property.\n\nThe couple may have permission from the property owner. They may also care about the neighborhood too. Or, they may be trespassing. Or on the run for murder.\n\nPoint is, we don't know anything about them so there are only 2 assumptions that can be made. Either they are criminals, or they aren't. There is ZERO way of knowing. So to assume someone is *not* a criminal is no more wrong or right than to assume they are.\n\nIgnoring the fact that they *are* criminals if they are trespassing...\n\nAGAIN... Yes, OP WBTI if she called because of many reasons you stated. My point is, you called on the OP to \"speak to them like humans\" in the very same sentence you disparaged her for just having feelings... Which she thought COMPASSIONATELY enough to seek guidance rather than jump to conclusions about the couple's intentions.\n\nBeing an asshole because someone has a honest thought in their mind, and have the wherewithal and humility to crowd source for help unpacking... That's not compassion.", "Unnecessarily bringing the police into the equation is where OP would be TA. Of course OP isn't responsible for the housing or policing systems, but OP has other options to ensure the potential risks to their property are reduced.", "This is not true. I live in a city with a high rate of homelessness and I have had friendlier relationships with my unhoused neighbors than homeowners. They are absolutely part of the community and invested in it. \n\nOP can take precautions that do not pose a material or physical risk to her neighbors.", "Yes, I do. The couple she had gotten to know also had \"nothing to lose\". And to imply they have nothing to lose because they don't live in a house, in their neighborhood, is ridiculous. They have a great deal to lose. If a crime is committed, they'll be the first suspects. And it's likely they chose that neighborhood because it's safe. Just like OP, they want a safe place to live.\n\nOP could also get to know this couple, if that would make her feel better.", "[deleted]", "Yeah, and so is sodomy (in my state and several others). In Tennessee, being trans is a crime. In many states, having an abortion is a crime.\n\n\nMeanwhile you can marry an underage child in about forty states.\n\n\nIf you're relying on the law for your morality, you are lost.", "Why are you more worried about the house than your own family's wellbeing? Do you keep guns in the house? Have you shared that tidbit aloud in the back yard?  I am neither recommending nor discouraging this. It just seems odd that your concerns didn't arise until your departure plans arose.", "Maybe. I agree that I personally would only involve the cops as a last resort, and there might be alternative solutions for OP.\n\nBut it's easy to envision scenarios where that's perhaps not the case. Maybe you live in a new area and have 0 friends or family nearby, and you don't really know your neighbors yet, for example. So if you have nobody available to even keep an eye on your home, it can be tough.\n\nAgain, OP is not the asshole for being concerned with the safety of her property, which is almost certainly the most valuable things she owns, if she's like most people. \n\nAs a side note, in my experience people who downplay the crime concerns caused by the issue of homelessness often haven't seen how bad things can get. When you've seen someone OD and die up against the fence of your property, you get a better appreciation for just how fast things can get horribly depressing and ugly.", "Never said that. They're trespassing on the business who owns the property if they don't have permission. Never said OP should call the cops for trespassing either. Just pointing out that you said they weren't committing a crime.", "The original comment I responded to said they weren't committing a crime. I simply stated that if they are trespassing, they are literally in the act of committing a crime. That's all. It's a fact. Sorry if you don't like facts.\n\nI also haven't said one way or another whether or not I agree with the law. In fact, I have stated MANY times in this thread that I don't think OP should call the cops.\n\nThe hilarious issue that OP has uncovered here is that people get really angry when they think other people are making assumptions... Meanwhile they ignore the fact that they, themselves, are doing just that. And in reality, they shame the person who is *actually* exercising MORALITY by seeking advice. But then again, I guess not everyone can have a perfectly calibrated moral compass, like you.", "To be fair, I would also be concerned about my home when I leave for extended periods of time. Especially if there's people that often living, hang out or chill near my house. It's not odd. It would be odd to call the cops on them.", "I definitely agree they are reasonable in their concerns, and they should take steps to reduce any risk, but even in a new area there are professional housesitters. That's what I do when I am away. It helps to know it is someone's job to look after my home.", "[deleted]", "\n>What business are you talking about?\n\nOP said they were on an empty lot owned by a business.\n\n\n>You seem like you hate the homeless.\n\nBecause I literally said OP shouldn't call the cops? Makes sense.", "I see it. Well if it was an issue you'd think the owners would\u2019ve notice and did something within the months", "Correct. One of the several reasons I would take issue with OP calling the cops in the first place."]}
