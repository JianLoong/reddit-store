Another of my best friends, steve, said they'd come with and asked me to stay behind to get candy from houses and keep an eye on my friends and to meet up at the oval of a park nearby at 7:00 PM.\n\nfast forward a few hours and steve calls another friend, saying \"hey are you guys coming, it's 7:00 PM we need to meet up\". The other friend asks where and he says \"at the kumon park\" (kumon is the name of an education thing that i used to go to and it was right next to the park). apparently nobody thinks of telling me anything because they all decide to bunch up and head to a completely different place before steve calls again, sounding more pissed off; \"pass the phone to TheEqualizer1212\", they give me the phone and i hear where he meant to meet up and i tell the group to start moving in that direction, however, i am known as the group dumbass so literally nobody follows me and then after a while, steve calls me again, sounding incredibly pissed off \"Dude i got fucking robbed by some dickheads who go to our school\" (he specified who it was, im just not mentioning it because this is the internet.), i tell the group that he got robbed and that he sounded very pissed and they all dont believe me and start scouring more houses for candy. Eventually i get pissed right the fuck off that nobody wants to help my friends who got robbed and say \"you know what? Fuck this!\" and start running in the direction that he wanted us to go to.\n\ni get there and he asks where the group is and i tell him the truth; nobody believed him, thought i was lying, started scouring the neighbourhood for candy, and, he gets even more pissed off that nobody believed him, his friends get pissed off too that they had to fight people for their shit and nobody but me came to help, my mates, steve, tyler and their friends never got any candy because they were meeting up and trying to not get robbed. i gave them my candy and stuck with them, eventually we told tyler and his friends to leave and enjoy halloween, found the group, tried to ask why the fuck they didnt believe us and their excuse was: \"he said it in a way that didn't sound like it was true!\" and then victimised themselves, screamed at me and steve and we both left angry. tommorrow will be an interesting school day.", "created_utc": 1667252629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yipv8r/aita_for_leaving_my_friend_group_to_help_my/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
