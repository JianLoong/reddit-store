I would be revoking your sisters rights to any discounts immediately since she clearly does not appreciate you pr your assets.", "op=NTA\n\nYou get to offer discounts on your property, she does not. \n\nAn apology is appropriate, but at the same time, if you sister understood what was appropriate behavior she wouldn't have offered the discount without checking with you first.", "Your sister is the ah.. how the hell can you offer up someone else\u2019s established for a discount and you have no stake in it? Ridiculous", "Lol! A discount for being Christian! Wow. Just\u2026wow. I used to get requests for discounts on the platform. I\u2019ve never given discounts on Airbnb, unless they are my own offers.

That would make you look like a stingy person, and validate your sister. You just need to take a hard line on a case by case basis, like this one."]}
