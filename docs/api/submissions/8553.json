If she'd approached you and said 'Look, niece is really hard up and could do with a break, is there any chance you could offer her a good rate?' you could have maybe looked for an off peak time when you'd be less likely to get another booking and offer her a discount for then, or offered her any cancellations that come up at a discount if someone has paid a non-refundable deposit already. If she's wanting to go in the middle of peak season that's a whole different plate of biscuits, she shouldn't even be asking you if you'd give a discount then, let alone doing it without your permission.", "NTA.

That is a solid approach. I actually would have been ok with the discount, if I\u2019d been asked first.
