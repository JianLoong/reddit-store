But it hasn\u2019t come without struggle. \n\nA few years ago my father was diagnosed with dementia and she suggested we should move him in with us so we could take care of him and look after him. However, once we moved him to our home, she started being very aggressive towards him. It started small, little things like, put your dirty clothes in the hamper or, don\u2019t leave your wet towel on the bathroom floor, both I agree with. \n\nBut then it got\u2026 nit-picky. Little things like, screaming at him for not emptying his trash can in his den when it was only half full, leaving a half full water bottle on the counter, not rinsing his utensils off fully. I mean full on screaming at him where I would have to step in and separate them. \n\nEventually, we had a child. As any parent knows, you buy certain things for your child to eat since kids are stupidly picky. Our son was specific with yogurt and would only eat a certain yogurt. My dad would eat yogurt every morning with breakfast but one day, he was out, so naturally he ate one of my sons \u201ccertain yogurt\u201d. When my wife discovered this it was FULL on WWIII.\n\nNow was he in the wrong. Yes. Was he told many times that those are for the kid. Yea. We even wrote on the lid \u201cDO NOT EAT\u201d. However, he had dementia. So while yes, he was in the wrong, I can\u2019t fully blame him. I believe in his mind he just saw yogurt and thought \u201cthis is fine\u201d \n\nI say all this to get to this point.\n\nMy father just passed away a couple months ago. \n\nTonight I walk into the house and my wife and her mom were sitting on the couch. My wife was laughing because her mom handed her a bag of goldfish with only one piece left in it. Now, these are my sons goldfish. Not for us, not for guests, for the kid only. It was also the last bag we had in the house. When I left this morning it was unopened.  I don\u2019t eat them, she doesn\u2019t eat them. But apparently it\u2019s okay if her mom does and eats an entire bag in one sitting. \n\nI brought it up to her that, hey, these are for our son. She shrugged it off and said \u201cso what?\u201d\n\nI reminded her of how she would get on my dad for eating our sons food and that it\u2019s a double standard that it\u2019s okay when her mom eats his food, but when my dad would do it, it was a full on scream fest. She was not phased in the least. She told me I was being ridiculous for even bringing that up and that it\u2019s not the same.  \n\nIn my mind, yea, you\u2019re right it\u2019s not the same. One yogurt for him is one day. However one bag of gold fish is 3-4 days worth for him. We argued, in front of her mom, for a few minutes. Finally I said \u201cI guess if it\u2019s your family it\u2019s a perfect world and no one does any wrong\u201d and walked out to the garage. \n\nSo AITA for thinking she has a double standard and let\u2019s her parent get away w things she would never let mine get away with?\n\nETA: I did not in any way tolerate the way she treated him, for those asking. I had cut out an entire paragraph due to the character limit on this sub. The way she treated him almost ended our marriage.\n\nTo be more clear:\n1. I did not tolerate it\n2. I stopped it MANY times\n3. I absolutely would try to talk to him about it, but he would completely forget anything had even happened 30-60 minutes later\n4. The whole yogurt thing was over a year ago, it\u2019s just one example I used. \n5. Her parents are actually amazing people who I love to death and I would never treat them the same way\n6. I have tried to talk to my wife about all of the things everyone has, so far, mentioned here but she turns it around on me. \n7. I\u2019m starting to think I married the wrong person, for the second time..\n\nEdit 2:\n\nAfter reading some of your comments I want to say a few more things. \n\nFirst, remember, there is a child involved as well. But reading what some are posting about her behavior is teaching him it\u2019s okay to be verbally abusive, definitely a wake up call for me. I guess I didn\u2019t see it or was ignoring it but it makes sense now. \n\nI want to add as well and this is not defending her, she would help A LOT with my dad, including bathing him and feeding him in his final months. I\u2019d like to think she did love him, as he did so much for us, but I am now as I have been, questioning that. \n\nI do attend therapy weekly (VA) and have talked about this with my therapist who has chalked it up to \u201cstress\u201d on her part. I have asked her to go to sessions on her own as well, but she says she doesn\u2019t have time. \n\nI also will try to respond to as many of you as possible but holy shit, y\u2019all are much faster than I am lol.\n\nEdit 3: I adjusted something\u2019s to make this less recognizable in case she some how sees it.", "created_utc": 1667788628, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yoaerj/aita_for_getting_on_my_wife_about_her_double/", "score": 90, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And not just general-purpose-food that's in the house that he can eat if it's around?", "Thanks for clarifying, that was the only other option. My dude, it seems you picked shrews both times.

Sometimes it would be a week or two in between. Sometimes a month in between incidents.  But we also had a 6 month old child and I couldn\u2019t exactly kick her to the curb. My son isn\u2019t even 2 yet. So tell me, how can I manage a father with dementia, work, my wife and my child all on my own? I couldn\u2019t. For every 10 good days, maybe we would have 1 bad day with them arguing. \n\nI also had to listen to my dad constantly bitch about her as well. So it\u2019s two fold. \n\nI did what I had to do, made the choices I had to make for my son. Not for me, not for her, not for my dad.

One day as I was walking towards the living room I heard my sister arguing with our Mom (Mom was a difficult parent I admit), what angered me was hearing my young nieces and nephew verbally telling their grandmother off. I asked my sister to come talk to me in private, I told her the next time I heard her disrespecting our mother I was kicking her ass, I was that angry. Years later my sister told me she never disrespected our mother again, not because of my threat but being shamed for treating our mother like that. The sad thing is her own kids have no qualms screaming and yelling at my sister and their Dad. My sister has called me crying about the disrespect from her grownup children, we live states apart and I have visited my sister, her kids keep their lips sealed around me on how they treat their mom, they are well aware I will verbally shred them if I hear them disrespect her.\n\nOP will learn the hard way as their son gets older, he is a sponge that soaked up how his mother treated his grandfather", "While I was at work, both on and off of remote and then after layoffs, a job out of the house, I was the primary, she was secondary. Even after working full days I would be 100% in charge of his care. She would only help when I wasn\u2019t home, or sick. \n\nEven with the DPOA, which my dad never had until my wife insisted on getting, I was still number one and she was number two. \n\nTo clarify, I have no siblings and my dad had no remaining family. So at the time I was happy to have her be willing to accept the role of POA in case something happened to me. \n\nMy dad had no money or anything like that, so she didn\u2019t stand to gain anything by being the second POA, I just thought she was being nice. But now after reading what everyone is saying here, I\u2019m second guessing her intentions. Although I will say this,  I\u2019m thankful she insisted we got the DPOA put in place because it definitely helped me a lot in the final years and months."]}
