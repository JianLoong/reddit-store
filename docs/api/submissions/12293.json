And it's just so frustrating being treated like a blank slate to project whatever the fuck onto when I'm a person in my own right.\n\nI don't want to be some guys side character who's conveniently \"just like them but talks less and has tits\" lol. I've already been boxed into \"gamer gf\" and \"party gf\"  \"goth gf\" and \"hunting gf\" boxes despite none of those being my passions, they were just things the men who were into me projected onto me, and I'm getting such a bad vibe he's looking for his own side character here..", "So how harshly do you have to shut a guy down for the reaction to be \"she's an autistic lesbian\"?", "Holy hell - you do realise you\u2019re talking about an autistic person?

I can fix you\" - while being 100% off base and blatantly not making an effort to know me at all.\n\nI think he was saying I was autistic because....

If that adult is capable of living on their own and taking care of themself, the only thing an autism diagnosis is going to do is explain things that adult is thinking or feeling. \n\nSo even if this guy was right, he doesn't have to push because it is none of his business and of no use to you.

I\u2019m autistic, an autistic mum and a professional in the field. I\u2019m sorry he was so persistent but persistence is a common trait of autism. It\u2019s something we all have to practice as a skill. Don\u2019t see it as someone trying to say \u201cthere\u2019s something wrong with you\u201d - for us autistics, it\u2019s much more a case of \u201cHey!
