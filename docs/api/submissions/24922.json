I suppose from our ages the circumstances of her birth are very obvious, and because of this and the subsequent drama, she was never in my life growing up. I would say I\u2019ve met her less than 10 times in my life. When she was 16 she started consistently reaching out to me via social media but I was never interested. This stopped when we were about 20.\n\nSince then, I mostly forgot about about her existence until she reached out to me again at the start of this year, saying she\u2019d got engaged. She wanted me to come to her engagement party and help her get in contact with the rest of my dad\u2019s side of the family. I told her I wasn\u2019t interested but I did ask the rest of the family (granddad, aunts, cousins) if they wanted me to put them in touch with her and they said no, so I told her that, too. \n\nAbout a week later I got a message on social media from her fianc\u00e9, digging me out for how I treated her. He told me he understood that it was tough being the product of an affair and he gets that I would be jealous of her since I was shunned by the family, but that she felt terrible about it and had always wanted a relationship with me. I was as confused as I was angry because he had the entire story arse backwards. \n\nI forwarded the messages to Hannah with a question mark and she admitted that her fianc\u00e9 and his whole family don\u2019t know that she is affair baby, that they think she stayed in contact with Dad\u2019s family, that she went to the schools and university and basically lived the life I did. I didn\u2019t blast her for the lies, I just told her that if I ever heard from any of the people in her life again, I would tell them the truth. \n\nThe months went by. A few days ago, I received more messages, from the fianc\u00e9 and the fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister, calling me a heartless bitch for refusing Hannah\u2019s attempts at contact. The sister said I needed to get over my jealousy of Hannah. The fianc\u00e9 called me a spiteful witch for \u2018emotionally blackmailing\u2019 Hannah\u2019s dad into not going to the wedding. It took everything in me not to reply and read the lot of them to filth. \n\nSo, now I\u2019m contemplating whether I would be the AH for messaging them back with the truth. It can\u2019t go on like this, I told Hannah to handle her business and she didn\u2019t. Also, her lies are pretty creepy. She\u2019s marrying a guy who has no idea who she is. Then again, it\u2019s not like she sent these people after me, so maybe I would be the AH for tearing apart her whole life over something that isn\u2019t technically her fault.", "created_utc": 1692355940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15uh6rx/wibta_for_telling_my_half_sisters_new_family_that/", "score": 7320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not tearing her life apart, she is. It is technically her fault that she lied to everyone. She not only lied but she outed you, and after having some family harrass you, she still didn't tell them the truth and let more family harrass you. She is perpetuating the lies even knowing you know she's lying, and she's adding more lies - she's now making them think things are your fault! This is 100% on her.\n\nWrite up a message that's the truth, simple and honest.

She has been mistreated by your father's family because of his behaviour. Not her own. And it's clearly done a lot of damage to her.\n\nThat said, you haven't done anything wrong. And you are being slandered. You also don't seem to understand the greater repercussions of what she's doing. Identity theft is a serious problem. She could be messing with your future. She could interfere with your career, with your educational records. These lies she's telling will spread and influence the way people look at and treat you. It could prevent you from getting jobs, ruin friendships, and even affect your physical safety if shes getting people this fired up with rage against you. You can't let this slide.\n\nTell her fiance the truth; that she was the affair child, that she has borrowed your educational history, and that you passed on her request for contact, and have done nothing to prevent your father from attending the wedding. Send screenshots of the messages as proof. Then state that if you continue to be harassed by them for Hannah's lies, you will go to the police. Tell Hannah the same; she stops telling lies about you, or you will take it further. You have to protect yourself.\n\nIt's up to you how to handle your family, but they did abandon an innocent child. If the situations were reversed, they would have done it to you. They should be ashamed of themselves for their behaviour. It's not up to you to reconcile them, and clearly, Hannah is not safe or stable for you to be around, but please do ensure that you are safe if they ever turn their displeasure onto you.

And maybe see if it's possible to get a restraining order, this girl sounds unhinged. I speak from personal experience, my dad also had an affair daughter and she caused me and my brother a lot of troubles until dad got a restraining order against her (we were underage). Where is your dad in all of this? He should go and talk to those people and ask them to stop harassing you.", "I think you have to say something because she\u2019s basically Single White Female-ing you and now you\u2019re a target of random people\u2019s anger and hate because of it.

This is HER responsibility, SHE is causing this. And if they don't stop, escalate. Whatever you need to do to stop these AHs.", "NTA. I just want to add my vote with everyone telling you to tell Hannah's fiance and future inlaws the whole truth before this gets worse. Please do not make yourself their target anymore.", "NTA but I think just saying \"look, y'all got it backwards. My age speaks for itself\" likely would suffice.

Don\u2019t let this guy and his family be defrauded by her! \n\nAs someone else pointed out! How have they not worked out the age difference is the give away?", "NTA - You have warned her, and you have made it quite clear. Why should he be hounded for her own lies and guilt. Give her the ultimatum one more time, and should it continue, tell the truth only if it is not possible for you to block them all.", "NTA and you need to tell your father. I feel sorry for her and it's sad but it's not your problem.\nBlock all of these well-intentioned people and tell \"Hannah\" to tell the truth before you send the messages to her husband.\n\nThis sounds like the plot to a movie for real.", "NTA - I say tell them the truth! She told these people about you and gave them your contact info. Also update us.", "NTA say it all, why would you have to suffer all this war against you? It's her fault , she must face the consequences of her lies.", "Nta.

Stop contacting me or I will be forced to get lawyers involved in your harassment.\u201d Copy, paste, and send to each person who has reached out. \n\nNTA.", "OP, you warned her and the messages keep rolling in. Just set the record straight with screenshots and what not, and tell the flying monkeys that you asked Hannah to put a stop to it but she didn't. And then block them and live your life in peace. Your dad is an AH however, but that's none of your concern.\n\nETA: please keep us updated!", "NTA. It\u2019s not her fault that her existence is the result of an affair, but she has no business trying to bulldoze her way into your life and allow you to get caught up in her lies.", "NTA\n\nBut isn't there smthg between blowing up her engagement and doing nothing?\n\nLike you can write back that you have no idea what they are talking about and you can assure them with good conscience that you never blackmailed anybody emotionally to not attend her wedding, in fact the topic of your stepsister never comes up when you speak to your dad and you are perfectly fine with you and stepsister not being close and living different lifes and nobody in your family ever shunned you for anything surrounding your stepsister. And they should pls stop harassing you and contact your dad directly if they want to know why he doesn't want to attend the wedding. Thats his decision and you can't speak for him. You yourself are not gonna attend bc like stated you were never close or family or something. \n\nAnd then block them.  This way you don't reveal her lies and still make sure they stop contacting you by blocking them. If they then go out of their way to find your dad, well, your stepsister will have to answer a few question. If it ends bad, at least she can't blame you and you don't have an enemy for life.\n\nThey will find out her lies sooner or later anyway, no way she can hide this for long, now inspector fiance and future sil are on it. But this way you don't get involved in the drama. You know how they say, if you get bad news, shoot the messanger first, and then go from there. And you would be the messanger.", "NTA. Spill the tea.

Especially the man intending to marry her. \n\nNTA", "NTA they can\u2019t speak to you like that wether it\u2019s true or not. Also they are lying to the fianc\u00e9 about their whole life?

Idk how she thought she was going to get away with this when she\u2019s never been apart of your life or your dads family. Simply take a SS of you asking her about the first message and send the fianc\u00e9 that.  If her relationship blows up, that\u2019s not your fault. She\u2019s the one entering a marriage based on lies. To be honest, her fianc\u00e9 deserves to know the truth and who he\u2019s marrying.", "NTA He deserves to know the truth.", "NTA- you gave Hannah plenty of time to either set the record straight or at the very least make sure they never contact you. She didn\u2019t. I would simply send them the messages where you confronted Hannah and she admits to lying to them all. The fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t deserve what he\u2019s stepping into", "NTA.\n\nBut you made an ultimatum, it is now up to you to keep it.\n\nAs back-up it might be wise to get your dad involved in this mess, because honestly, it is his mess to clean up more than it is yours.", "NTA, nah you gotta message them the truth (and if you have screenshot of your family saying no send those) because he deserves to know he has a liar for a fianc\u00e9 (also you\u2019ve gotta update their reactions if you do decide to do it, pretty pls)", "Next time they message you all you have to say is \"I'm older than Hannah.\" And let them figure out the rest.

I\u2019m petty AF so I completely understand what you want to do and lying is never the answer so Hannah has kind of dug her own grave and you are under no obligation to have a relationship with her. I do feel bad for her though. She didn\u2019t ask to be born under those circumstances. That\u2019s not her fault. I can\u2019t imagine half of my family refusing anything to do with me just because I existed. Has your dad had anything to do with her? Are your parents still together? I won\u2019t call you an asshole but I feel shitty calling her one too.

Just the family. And also the half sister is a bit unhinged for her lie tbh.", "NTA but I would just send the screenshot to the father, ask him to deal with his child and block all those crazy people. Don't engage with her fiance and other family members at all. The more you interact with them, the more you'll get sucked into the whatever alternative universe they have going on. Also make sure that you don't have anything work related on social media that they can find so they don't start messing with your work by any chance.", "First half of the story I felt sad for her, second half I felt kind of indignated. For sure she has some trauma in her past, she has no guilt about the affair and how she came to this world, but she suffered all the consequences. Is clear as day that her lies are creepy and a bad thing not only for you, but for her. She is living in a big lie! I'm not sure that the good thing is to tell the truth to all them, but maybe only one person that could help her to start living her real life because she needs help not something that would ruin her life for sure.", "NTA - you told her that you don\u2019t want to be in contact with her for whatever reason and that\u2019s valid. She needs to respect that. If they would think of you as heartless but leave you be then so be it. Nothing that would \u201churt\u201d you.

Imagine being rejected by ones whole family.

Or just to get her husband and sister to stop it.\nAs for OP block everyone from Hannah's side ever being in contact.", "ESH", "I\u2019d say give her another chance to stop them. Block their info. \n\nEncourage her to tell them the truth because in reality it does not matter that she\u2019s the affair baby - but it will be hard for her to not have this blow up eventually. \n\nIn your shoes, I wouldn\u2019t want to add to her hardship because clearly, being the affair baby did it\u2019s damage.\n\nPersonal advice to you, stop even thinking of the term \u2018affair baby\u2019 (I only saw it online and it is disturbing!!). You\u2019re both kids and have NOTHING to denote that, a baby is a baby - there is no such thing as \u2018illegitimate\u2019 or \u2018affair\u2019 baby. There are affair partners and illegitimate extramarital relationships - none of it is the baby\u2019s fault or problem. You\u2019re both a victim in this respect. I\u2019m speaking as someone with awesome siblings, not all of us share the same mom but our parents\u2019 stories are not ours. The \u2018main\u2019 babies were always and always are fair to our siblings - we make it a level playing field. It doesn\u2019t hurt you to be kind basically, it\u2019s sad she felt the need to make this lie up. She\u2019s tried to be your sister and this needs professional help now. \n\n**I wouldn\u2019t out her lies, you have no reason to hurt her and leave her in the wreckage. I do not think she can handle that.**\n\nI\u2019d definitely encourage her to seek counselling and be there for her to get to that - knowing how much damage this has done to her. And she will likely lose her fianc\u00e9\u2026cause it\u2019s a massive lie. He may have got over it had it been earlier but now his family is planning a wedding around her stories \u2026she\u2019s gonna have a hard time talking it back. You blasting her makes her a villain to them when she\u2019s not, and this maybe the only family she has\u2026", "YTA - your sister isn\u2019t responsible for her parents mistakes.. she just wants to connect with you.

You have nothing to gain by ruining her life. Just block them all if you feel you need to, even if I think your anger is misplaced. The person that is most to blame, your father, is still in your life and you don't feel you need to ruin his life...", "YWBTA - don't go nuclear.\n\nBy getting involved and intentionally to stir things up when you don't have to, you have no interest, and all you would do is make things worse for that family by dropping a bomb on them and then disappearing. \n\nWhy? - because you got messages you didn't want from someone who was always desperate for your friendship?\n\n\nBlock their numbers and leave it there.", "NTA\n\nBlow her life apart.\n\nShe's manipulating that whole family, building a life on a lie with a guy that doesn't deserve to be screwed by a fraud, and causing you hell.

However, my father\u2019s affair which resulted in Hannah pretty much blew my family apart, hence why I have no interest in forming a relationship with her.

I suppose from our ages the circumstances of her birth are very obvious, and because of this and the subsequent drama, she was never in my life growing up. I would say I\u2019ve met her less than 10 times in my life. When she was 16 she started consistently reaching out to me via social media but I was never interested. This stopped when we were about 20.\n\nSince then, I mostly forgot about about her existence until she reached out to me again at the start of this year, saying she\u2019d got engaged. She wanted me to come to her engagement party and help her get in contact with the rest of my dad\u2019s side of the family. I told her I wasn\u2019t interested but I did ask the rest of the family (granddad, aunts, cousins) if they wanted me to put them in touch with her and they said no, so I told her that, too. \n\nAbout a week later I got a message on social media from her fianc\u00e9, digging me out for how I treated her. He told me he understood that it was tough being the product of an affair and he gets that I would be jealous of her since I was shunned by the family, but that she felt terrible about it and had always wanted a relationship with me. I was as confused as I was angry because he had the entire story arse backwards. \n\nI forwarded the messages to Hannah with a question mark and she admitted that her fianc\u00e9 and his whole family don\u2019t know that she is affair baby, that they think she stayed in contact with Dad\u2019s family, that she went to the schools and university and basically lived the life I did. I didn\u2019t blast her for the lies, I just told her that if I ever heard from any of the people in her life again, I would tell them the truth. \n\nThe months went by. A few days ago, I received more messages, from the fianc\u00e9 and the fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister, calling me a heartless bitch for refusing Hannah\u2019s attempts at contact. The sister said I needed to get over my jealousy of Hannah. The fianc\u00e9 called me a spiteful witch for \u2018emotionally blackmailing\u2019 Hannah\u2019s dad into not going to the wedding. It took everything in me not to reply and read the lot of them to filth. \n\nSo, now I\u2019m contemplating whether I would be the AH for messaging them back with the truth. It can\u2019t go on like this, I told Hannah to handle her business and she didn\u2019t. Also, her lies are pretty creepy. She\u2019s marrying a guy who has no idea who she is. Then again, it\u2019s not like she sent these people after me, so maybe I would be the AH for tearing apart her whole life over something that isn\u2019t technically her fault.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I imagine dad was not getting as much sex as he wanted during his wife\u2019s pregnancy and went looking else where.\n\nReally the dad is the biggest asshole in this story. Hannah is a woman that now requires therapy because of the circumstances of her birth and subsequent treatment by dads family.

Oh, that makes me wonder if it was really the mom's lie all along and she's just been forced to go along with it since she was a teen or something. Not that it matters, the OP still doesn't deserve to be harassed over this.\n\nI'm guessing this has become an issue now because she's getting married and she's told everyone she's still in contact with her dad's family, so when none of them show up to the wedding, people are going to wonder.

I am in no way jealous of her and I am not preventing anyone from attending your wedding. She asked for my help contacting them, I forwarded her request on, and they declined. This whole thing is confusing to me, If I had been shunned by the family, why would she need my help to contact them? What power would the shunned person have here?

The sins of the parent(s) are their own and the offspring are innocent victims. Use of the term just further victimizes/stigmatizes people for something completely out of their control.  \n\n2. I don't doubt that you have your facts straight, but Hanna just being the younger of you isn't evidence in itself of \"the circumstances of her birth\". It is not hard to imagine scenarios which would result in the *older* child being the product of infidelity instead, such as a long term affair before having a child with their spouse. Further scenarios are possible where *neither* child is the result of infidelity. The couple might have separated then later reconciled, or the couple was adventurous and invited a third to join them in bed. Even the father staying with one woman over the other isn't really evidence on its own, as in the first scenario, it would be reasonable for the wife to leave when they eventually learn of the affair, and in the last scenario, it may be more socially acceptable/easier for him to admit to an affair that didn't happen than for them both to admit to the adventurous behavior.", "I assume this is your Dad's daughter.

Instead, I only told a few people, and because not everyone knew the truth, this person escalated\u2014 and by the time things got *really* bad, they\u2019d (without my knowledge) been working to destroy my reputation for months.

How did you even come to the decision of not wanting anything to do with her?", "NTA. Your dad seems like he might suck, though.", "NTA. Hannah not only started this, apparently she is nearly obsessive with becoming: you.

However, if ripping off the blinders means she loses both her adopted identity and her victimhood, along with her fianc\u00e9, she could pose a very real danger to you. I would write up the full reveal, send it only to her with the warning that anymore contact will lead you to telling everyone the truth, plus get a restraining order filed against her to boot. Also warn her that any formal identity theft will be dealt with swiftly and legally. Then, apologize for \u201dour\u201d father who absolutely is the AH. Tell her you can\u2019t choose her over your mother, who would be re-injured and humiliated over and over were she to become a part of your life. Also tell her that you are sorry that she believes you are so much better than her when you are certain that isn\u2019t true. Advise her to work on loving herself as herself and not as pseudo-you. Ask her to consider telling her future husband the truth now rather than letting it come out later, devastating their relationship. Decades ago, I represented the minor children of the second family who only discovered their deeply religious father was an adulterer after his death.

Can you imagine Falling in love with someone only to find out that they lied to you about everything about their childhood into adulthood (she also lied about university)?

IDGAF about Hannah being the product of an affair. I care about her being a lying liar who lies. Sure, her childhood was fucked up. But that doesn\u2019t excuse her lying to her fianc\u00e9.

Father is an AH for sure.", "I feel like family was pressuring Hannah about if Dad was going to be at wedding.  She had already lied about her life and probably doesn't have Dad's contact info, but she can't tell new family about that, so she decided to blame it on her half-sister.  She's a bitch and is blocking Dad from coming to the wedding.

She must have her life totally silo\u2019d off from her fianc\u00e9s. That said it\u2019s not that hard to search social media for someone\u2019s relatives and that\u2019s the first thing most people would do when there is affair baby drama.

You seem completely detached from her other than her lies, so inform the others about this in an objective manner and then block them all. You don't owe her a relationship. She is a ton of trouble.
