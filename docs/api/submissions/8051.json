I was probably the only one in a serious relationship not given an extension to bring the partner.\n\nI contacted him asking if I was allowed to bring my partner, and he said the guest list had grown too large and if there were to be a cancellation I would be one of the first to get the extension. This seems nice until you have to factor in that my partner would need to book a flight last minute, which significantly ups the cost. The wedding is in 2 months.\n\nThis made me a little upset, as he is asking me to travel across the country  (where after plane tickets, hotels, tuxedos would cost 1500+), an extra $600 for a bachelor party, and he gave other long term partners the invite, but not mine.

You figure out how big of a invitation list you can really afford, invite that number of people - however you determine who gets invited - and the number of positive RSVPs you get by the reservation deadline is it, all of the \u201cNo\u201ds you get don\u2019t get turned into second-tier guests, they turn into money saved on plates and drinks, which can either be spent on attendance-independent reception extras, or extra cash for the honeymoon, or just post-nuptial savings. \n\n\nAnyway, second, you\u2019re right that last-minute flights are much more expensive, and if you\u2019re flying together, getting seats on the same flight, god forbid actually sitting next to each other, may not be possible; coordinating multiple flights times for the two of you could easily end up being a major hassle, behind the expense. \n\n\nThird, and not really related to the main point, $6k for a bachelor party, *in advance*?!? What, are they reserving a VIP room at a high-end strip club?\n\n\nIn your shoes, I would tell the bridal party, straight up, \u201cthis is the date I need to make hotel and airline reservations, to both be assured of getting the reservations, and not get hit with last-minute upcharges; if my partner is not my +1 by then, then I\u2019m sorry, but I will not be able to attend, I hope you have a lovely day\u201d. That gives them a firm deadline to make their choice, and saves you extra hassles and complications, and will also show how close of a friend they view you; after all, you\u2019re spending $2k+ to attend, not including a wedding gift, all they\u2019re spending is the cost of your plate (which in my experience is usually less than the price of the wedding gift).", "Dude, wtf? $600 for the bachelor party.

Sorry that's me.", "Maybe the wedding has grown to expensive which is why they are now downsizing on the plus 1s, when I saw the cost of the stag do my first thought was that the groom would spend $600 on the stag night, and save the $5,400 to put towards paying for the wedding.", "Why would anybody expect the wedding party to pay for their wedding?\n\nOutrageous.", "What makes you think bride and groom told the truth about the reason for the plus one?", "Wow what a bjtch", "I guess the stag do was such an outrageous sum of money my mind jumped to an extreme. Couldn't think of any other reason why 1 night would cost so much!", "They have 20 people in the wedding party (not including the bride and groom). I am sure that they could have afforded a plus 1 for OPs partner.", "If they lied about it then that makes them even more in the wrong.", "How are you so sure? Where you privy to their budget?", "\u201cSorry can\u2019t go\u201d is a reason. \n\nIf you feel offended you not required to expound on why you are offended.", "NTA\n\nLongterm partner, flights involved, and groom was shady about it. Etiquette is either all the wedding party gets a courtesy invite or none do. He's run afoul of this.\n\nThe rules of weddings are you do not get to dictate who is invited, but you do get to decide if you go. Not going would likely tank the friendship, but you are likely to be resentful over your partner beings slighted for the future anyway", "NTA \n\nPolitely let him know that you cannot attend his wedding without your partner. Tell him you care about your friendship but unfortunately you and your girlfriend are a package deal.", "NTA. I would not go too.", "NTA \n\nYou're the groomsman, not a friend who got invited out of courtesy. \nIt's totally reasonable for you to decide jot to attend the wedding. I would be hurt and annoyed too", "NTA however there is more to this story whether you see it or not. There is zero reason why they would allow everyone else a plus one but not you. That's nit a \"guest lost\" issue. That's a personal issue. The problem isn't that they didn't warn you beforehand, the problem is they excluded her at all.", "NTA and to be honest, if I was your partner, I would feel hurt if you did attend. A polite declined RSVP and gift would suffice.", "NTA. Don\u2019t forget to factor in any vacation time you would be taking for this vs with your SO later this year.", "NTA\n\nIt is acceptable to not go when partner is not invited, especially when there is major travel and expense involved.", "Nta", "NTA even IF what he was saying is true and u just happen to be the one chosen to get his partner cut from the wedding i still wouldnt have gone, on the other hand im pretty sure he couldve invited her it seem intentional that he didnt.", "Would I attend a wedding across the country, a 2/3 day trip without my partner? Absolutely not especially if the bride and groom actually get along or are at least civil with the partner. NTA and either they secretly don't like her or they are trying to set you up. Either way it's a no go.", "NTAH.  This is suspicious at best.  If you\u2019re in the wedding party it\u2019s expected you have a +1.  Don\u2019t let them know you are hurt, but just say to some logistics you can\u2019t go.  Just like how they used logistics to. Or invite her.  If it\u2019s not malicious then keep the cordial relationship with them.  Probably will be happy to have one extra seat open.  As for the $600 bachelor party, just give them the cash as their wedding gift if you want or something off their registry and let them know you got them something.", "Also, I find it suspicious that OP\u2019s partner had to be on the cut list. There weren\u2019t any friends of their parents they don\u2019t know well? Distant cousins they haven\u2019t seen in years? It\u2019s super rude to go right for one of your groomsman\u2019s long-term partners.", "What's an appropriate gift in this context? A fart sealed in a box?", "Yea but it sounds like everyone in the party got a plus one except them. Even though theyve all been friends for longer. Seriously what is one extra person? If guest list is truly a problem, then they needed to look further down the line than the wedding party.", "This has zero to do with money, even if OP mentioned it as an aside. It's the fact that everyone got to bring a us one except him, even though his plus one is friends with the bride and groom. That makes zero sense.", "A gift card to Walmart. So they can buy something tacky.", "It's more the social ettiqute. As long as numbers stay on or under their licensed amount, venues don't care all that much. It was more the kick in the guts of \"you're a dispensable friend. We don't actually really want you there, we just invited you because you're attached to him\"", "He wasn't on the couch but he certaintly didnt get much out of me for a week or so. In amy capacity! he's no longer on speaking terms with the friends and nor am I. He's ridiculously brilliant as a partner in many ways but having the \"correct\" response i social scenarios like this fly over his head like some sort of plane banner.....", "Except all the other groomsmen got plus one's.", "wow...great way to start a marriage. Not allowing your groom's childhood bf to bring a +1? I'm surprised you bf didn't makes this a hill to die on.", "True! Unless the OP hasn't paid his share for the batchlor party yet and that's why they took the plus 1 away from him?\n\nJust trying to make sense of the wedding craziness now and making some super leaps!", "And why exactly? He absolutely can say that. Why can't this supposed \"friend\" be honest about why they don't want the partner there?", "You're right. There is a real reason that they are not sharing.\n\nReal friends and real adults are honest about any issues. They don't hide behind fake excuses.", "In a real friendship, friends are honest with each other. \n\nBy your logic, is anytime someone speaks up and says they are offended and explains why considered emotional blackmail? \n\nI'll save you the trouble: it isn't."]}
