His wedding party is quite large, around 10 guys. I have been with my partner for a long  time, about 6 years, lived with her for about 4. The future groom and bride know her, and have hung-out with her on several occasions, she is not a random to them. However, now we live across the country from them, and have for some time. We haven't hung out with them much the past couple years due to this, outside of their engagement party, which both me and my partner attended.\n\nThe groom gave me no warning - the invite just didn't mention my partner. I contacted other groomsman who I am close with and they were given an invite for their partner. I was probably the only one in a serious relationship not given an extension to bring the partner.\n\nI contacted him asking if I was allowed to bring my partner, and he said the guest list had grown too large and if there were to be a cancellation I would be one of the first to get the extension. This seems nice until you have to factor in that my partner would need to book a flight last minute, which significantly ups the cost. The wedding is in 2 months.\n\nThis made me a little upset, as he is asking me to travel across the country  (where after plane tickets, hotels, tuxedos would cost 1500+), an extra $600 for a bachelor party, and he gave other long term partners the invite, but not mine. I would have been entirely understanding had he contacted me beforehand and let me know, but it felt a little rude to receive the notice by the mailed invite with no explanation or forewarning.\n\nWould I be the a hole to decline this invitation and tell him I was hurt?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT to say the bride and groom do not have a problem with my partner.

It is pretty standard etiquette to invite the bridal party with plus ones. If, for whatever reason, your close friend and future wife decided not to that, then the ONLY way it would be minutely acceptable is if it was a broad swath. This is not the case here: some groomsmen got plus ones, you did not. Your bridal party is not where you cut the guest list. \n\nI\u2019m all about healthy relationships where people do things without their partner, like hang out/vacation with friends. This is not one of those things. \n\n If I and one of my best friends Meghan were in Jane\u2019s bridal party, and Meghan\u2019s husband was invited but mine was not, I would question my whole relationship with Jane, what she thought of my partner, how much she valued me, and ultimately would not go if I was told my husband was on the back up cancellation list.", "NTA\n\nI would seriously re-evaluate my friendship it this happened to me.\n\nWho is going to be hurt the most by your decision?

They truly needed to cut guests, and it came down to a close friend of people that live close by, and your long term girlfriend.

A childhood best friend of his got married and the bride wouldn\u2019t let me come, because she didn\u2019t know me- even though it was a 1,000 person wedding.

But people are shady and will pull this shit.", "He has the option of not attending. You can't force people to extend invitations to others.", "No it isn't. Perhaps they could only pay for those to whom invitations were extended. Is there some pot of gold somewhere from which they can cover all costs for everyone? It's called a budget for a reason. Maybe they can afford to pay for 8 and not 9. Should they not invite 8 because they can't pay for 9 just to make 9 happy? Perhaps they are much closer to 8 than the 9th. We don't get to call shots on other people's events. Go or don't go. \n\nIt's like a bus with a capacity of 30 persons max that comes to a bus stop and with 25 persons already onboard can only take 5 persons. However, 8 persons are at the bus stop. Should the driver not stop since he can't take all 8 persons? Or should he take the 5 and carry them on their way? If he stops and all 8 tries to board his bus and somehow they all fit what happens if there is a supervisor at the next stop coming to perform checks. Should he now lose his job because he didn't follow regulations? Should the groom go take out a loan to cover the additional expense.

I really only care about the insinuation that OP was getting a free ride to a wedding and therefore should be chill about being the odd-one-out. Because he's not getting a free ride there.\n\nThat's what I care about. That you implied that OP wouldn't have to pay to go. That's patently inaccurate. He's currently set to pay 2k between wedding and bachelor party.", "OP is financing his attendance and participation if he chooses to go. Is he paying for the venue, decor and food? People can plan whatever wedding that they like and invite whomever they like. Invitees can choose to go or not. Simple. If I was OP I wouldn't attend. Surely by now he sees that he isn't all that important to the couple. Jeez."]}
