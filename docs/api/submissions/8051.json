His wedding party is quite large, around 10 guys. I have been with my partner for a long  time, about 6 years, lived with her for about 4. The future groom and bride know her, and have hung-out with her on several occasions, she is not a random to them. However, now we live across the country from them, and have for some time. We haven't hung out with them much the past couple years due to this, outside of their engagement party, which both me and my partner attended.\n\nThe groom gave me no warning - the invite just didn't mention my partner. I contacted other groomsman who I am close with and they were given an invite for their partner. I was probably the only one in a serious relationship not given an extension to bring the partner.\n\nI contacted him asking if I was allowed to bring my partner, and he said the guest list had grown too large and if there were to be a cancellation I would be one of the first to get the extension. This seems nice until you have to factor in that my partner would need to book a flight last minute, which significantly ups the cost. The wedding is in 2 months.\n\nThis made me a little upset, as he is asking me to travel across the country  (where after plane tickets, hotels, tuxedos would cost 1500+), an extra $600 for a bachelor party, and he gave other long term partners the invite, but not mine. I would have been entirely understanding had he contacted me beforehand and let me know, but it felt a little rude to receive the notice by the mailed invite with no explanation or forewarning.\n\nWould I be the a hole to decline this invitation and tell him I was hurt?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT to say the bride and groom do not have a problem with my partner. They have always gotten along and have never had a fight or any sort of awkwardness or argument.", "created_utc": 1674451422, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10j4rec/wibta_to_decline_a_wedding_invite_i_was_supposed/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No excuse need be stated. Keep it muted and civil. \n\nSend a nice gift if you feel that's appropriate and include a card signed from both you AND your partner.", "DEFINITELY NTA. It is pretty standard etiquette to invite the bridal party with plus ones. If, for whatever reason, your close friend and future wife decided not to that, then the ONLY way it would be minutely acceptable is if it was a broad swath. This is not the case here: some groomsmen got plus ones, you did not. Your bridal party is not where you cut the guest list. \n\nI\u2019m all about healthy relationships where people do things without their partner, like hang out/vacation with friends. This is not one of those things. \n\n If I and one of my best friends Meghan were in Jane\u2019s bridal party, and Meghan\u2019s husband was invited but mine was not, I would question my whole relationship with Jane, what she thought of my partner, how much she valued me, and ultimately would not go if I was told my husband was on the back up cancellation list.", "NTA\n\nI would seriously re-evaluate my friendship it this happened to me.\n\nWho is going to be hurt the most by your decision? Your long term partner is most likely already hurt because she was not invited with you and will be even more so if you go. Your friend will probably just get another groomsmen.\n\nIt sounds like they have a stand by list anyway.", "NTA. Just decline the invitation but there\u2019s no need to give reason.", "nta. your friend is a big one though. How can he expect a groomsman NOT to bring a plus one to a wedding? Even if he told you beforehand, he can't have one rule for others and one for you. I mean if all the other groomsman are having a +1, so should you. One more person isn't going to break the bank.\n\nIf it were me, I'd just politely email/text/call and say you can't attend. Don't wait for him to 'accommodate' your partner last minute.", "NTA\n\nYou should not go. Many reasons and none of which you need to share with the groom. \n\n1. You got no warning. That\u2019s not polite or courteous. \n\n2. Others were invited - with their partners. \n\n3. You were subsequently told that your better half is on a backup list - further underscoring what they think of you/her. \n\nSend an appropriate gift and decline politely.", "NTA.

NTA.\n\nThere's at least 3 rude faux pas' on your friend's part. 1 - it is standard etiquette to invite SOs of the bridal party, and in most cases considered rude not to give them a +1 even if they don't have a long term partner. 2 - it is rude to exclude someone who was invited to the engagement party from the wedding, and 3 - extremely rude to invite other bridal party SOs but not yours. \n\nDon't go to this wedding lol", "NTA. Good for you for declining the invite. If you were a guest, then sure, but to be part of the wedding and everyone else\u2019s SO were invited and not mine?

If he could give the other groomsmen a +1, there is no reason for you to not get one, it's quite rude.", "NTA, my husband was invited to a wedding of some friends of ours one year after our own. The friends came to our wedding, but they only invited my husband to theirs. They blamed it on numbers. The problem was they'd sent rsvp for both of us, we had organised child and dog care, arranged a few days off work, and then just cut me off the list closer to the time. I was and still am extremely hurt both by their actions and the fact my husband didn't see anything ering with this and went anyway. Thank you for standing by your partner.", "NTA but this is how I would see it if I wasn't given an actual explanation. They truly needed to cut guests, and it came down to a close friend of people that live close by, and your long term girlfriend. People that live nearby cause more frequent awkwardness about not being invited. It's even possible they are sort of hoping you do cancel to make more space. It's also possible that while he likes your girlfriend just fine, the groom wanted some buddy time without you worrying about the old ball and chain. Either way, there are better ways they could have handled the situation, but they are planning a wedding, so...", "Nta \nIs there a possibility of some type of bigotry on the part of the wedding couple against your partner?\n\n(Either way answer is the same .)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that they are singling you is weird, particularly as you live so far and it would not be practical or cheap for you to do a last minute. I would confront the groom about this, and the fact that it is ok for others but not you. It might be that they don't value your friendship the same way you do (e.g. growing apart). Unless, this couple really means something to you, I would not go, because if you leave your partner behind you may resent them on the day seeing others partner particularly if you realise they could have fitted her in.", "NTA if they can't invite a wedding party members partner... then I consider that a lack of respect.", "NTA", "NTA\nIt's rude from your friend not to give you a +1 in this case.", "YMBTA I don't believe plus ones are automatic.

But if you make it about your partner, then it\u2019s emotional blackmail.", "This.  Talk about tacky.  Are you sure they aren't trying to set you up with someone?  NTA.", "This.  Wedding party attendants in a relationship get invites for their SO's per EVERY etiquette guide. If they had to make cuts somewhere, it shouldn't be there. Backing out is the appropriate response.

I didn't have a wedding, but it seems like a bad idea to cut the guest list down AFTER the invitations have gone out?

Then count how many rsvp no and send out some more.", "I disagree on all of this.\n1) That's insane to extend the plus one to everyone else except for OP. If he's important enough to be asked to be in the wedding party, he damn well sure should be able to bring his partner. \n\n2) The OP said $600. I'm assuming that that money is for paying for the groom's drinks and buying rounds for others. Who knows. \n\nI don't think he would be able to be a guest since there's no room for his partner there wouldn't be room for him. \n\nNTA You do not need to provide an explanation for declining. If you'd like to send a card, gift, or money, you certainly could with a \"sorry I couldn't be there, congratulations.\" Per etiquette,   a person is not obligated to send a gift or card, just the decline reply as soon as possible. \n\nBTW, the groom is a major asshole.", "No it's not and you definitely have the wrong verdict.

This is not about the guest trying to control the guest list.", "Yes, they control the list, but then the op doesn't have to go. It's still not emotional blackmail. They feel slighted and not valued, so then why be a groomsman or even go to the wedding. I just don't see how they're an ah for doing so.", "They can cancel without citing to the list.  We are not the bride and or groom. So we don\u2019t know whether the line about the guest list getting too long is the real reason. It seems to be that this was the excuse .", "But why should he not state the reason why he's not going? That's ridiculous. 'No, I won't be going, and I won't stay why, you figure it out' is way worse."]}
