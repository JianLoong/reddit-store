We recently (6 months ago) moved into a new neighbourhood, with a big garden and extra-friendly neighbours, much to my wife's request. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, when I came home I noticed there were three kids in our house. They were about the same age as our kids and my wife told me they were our neighbours' kids, and that they'd met our kids when they were playing out in the snow. I brushed it off and didn't think much of it, especially since my wife told me it was pretty common for kids in this area to come over to their friends' house.\n\nThree days ago, I noticed my wife was extremely down. I asked her what happened and she said the neighbors had given her a call and said that their kids were no longer allowed to come into our house. I don't know what their problem is (they didn't really give my wife a reason for this request of theirs.) but I was like that's what they want for their kids so we should respect that.\n\nMy wife got mad at me and said if the neighbour's kids were to ask her to come in, she couldn't tell them to stay out. She's a kind person and that would be the opposite of what she'd do. I said maybe kids could go out to play together but she insisted that it is too cold for that\n\nShe also mentioned the only reason she could think of was us being a same-sex couple. I said it did not matter anyways. I told her that we should still respect our neighbour's wishes or we could go have a face to face conversation with them. My wife simply said she can't leave those kids outside if they showed up. She called me heartless for even suggesting it.\n\nSo am I really in the wrong here? They're kids and they're neighbours their house is literally on the same street as ours.", "created_utc": 1674829730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mm639/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_shouldnt_have/", "score": 179, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lived there before we were born, facilitated the friendships. Our parents knew that we did this.

This actually makes people like you because people like feeling valued. Try something like this a couple of times, and then try inviting them round for dinner.\n\nIt could be they have some homophobic tendencies, but oftentimes this is because people just dehumanize the 'unknown' and there are plenty of stories out there of certain types of bigot actually changing their ways and becoming friends with those they were once intolerant of.\n\nMaybe that won't happen in this situation. Perhaps even probably. But if, through a small amount of effort, you give yourselves a reasonable chance to have a more ideal neighborly friendship with this people, it can improve lives for everyone involved.\n\nBut then again, I'm a straight, white, neurotypical male that hasn't had to struggle with this sort of thing so I've no idea how hard it actually is...", "NTA. If the kids show up, the correct course of action is to contact their parents or guardians. Absolutely do not let them inside without parental permission.

Of course we were allowed in if invited by the parents.\n\nI think your wife is right about it being because you are a same sex couple, but she should still just honor the others parents wish.

I respect that your wife is choosing to respect these kids and be kind to them despite their parents. Maybe it's safer than their home, maybe having more adults in their life can help them. I also understand why parents wouldn't want children that young in a stranger's house, they have no way to tell if you are a threat to their children.\n\nThe right thing is going to be highly subjective, but I don't think either one of you is being an AH for your different approaches.", "NTA.

Grow a friendship and once everyone is comfortable you might get where your wife wants to be.\n\nMy neighbor and I have a great relationship like that. We added a ladder on the wall so his daughter and mine can easily jump over and play in each other's back yard. Sometimes we watch the others little one when the other has errands to run.

And reasonably all she has to do is send the kids back across the garden and have them ask their parents to phone her for permission, and let them know unless their parent's give her the okay they can't come in and play. That was the norm when I was growing up", "NTA. You're right that you need to respect their wishes. And while bigotry is a common reason for this kind of thing to happen, there are plenty of other reasons they may not want their kids just coming over willy nilly (e.g. one of them has a severe allergy). I also agree that a face-to-face discussion might be warranted.", "Exactly - just stop the kids at the door & say - you can come in if you parents call me & say it is OK. Not that hard to put the responsibility on their parents.", "Hopefully the kids can just go to their own home before freezing to death.", ">I would never let my kids into someones else's house unless I regarded them as family. \n\nWhat?!??\n\nDo your kids not have friends?", "Your kids aren't allowed to go into their friends' houses even if you know the parents? Is this a common practice? Where do your kids hang out with their friends?", "Wait so your kids can't go to their friend's houses?  That seems to be a bit... much.", "That's kinda creepy and inhospitable, isn't it?", "Your vigilance is definitely keeping them safe. Socialized, well...not exactly, but definitely safe. \n\nSafe's the important one. As a person who had bad parents, I can't imagine how horrible I'd feel if one of my friends had gotten hurt by my creep of a father.", "Seriously. The wife is making is sound like she has to let the kids inside or they\u2019ll be re-enacting The Little Match Girl in the front yard.", ">Is this a common practice?\n\nI highly doubt asking the person that made that ridiculous claim if it's common practice is going to result with an accurate answer.", "With kids who are too young to have a phone, if they have five or six houses they could visit in a small area, makes it hard to find them at dinner time.", "We have parks. We have public libraries. We have public events like music festivals. None of their friends will be allowed in our house. This is a cultural practice unless they are friends we have had for years. I have friends that I regard as family and our kids are the same age range. They come over. I have a large circle of friends of both my own people and friends. They have plenty of friends that ARE allowed in our house because they respect our cultural rules. End story. I dont want just anyone in my house. \n\nSorry this is so foreign to you, but it is normal for our people", "It is a parents duty to protect their kids. I wouldn\u2019t even trust my parents with my kids life, let alone a neighbor", "Theres also a cultural element youre missing here and its none of your business. \n\nWe have friends and our kids are all the same age. My children are free to pass out my number for playdates, but no, absolutely not. They can go inside houses when they are teens and the dynamics are different. \n\nVirtually no one is allowed in our house. Different people have different customs and the internet isnt America.", "Completely agreed. Sure, they might be trustworthy kids but you should never just take the kids' word on what the parents are OK with. Go straight to the horse's mouth. There could be any number of reasons why the neighbours don't want them in OPs house - they could be germaphobes, religious zealots, vegans worried about what food they are having, the kids could have allergies or epilepsy or they might just not like the kids to be unsupervised with other adults that aren't in their trusted circle. And since OPs wife already let them in without checking it's reasonable they don't trust her now.\n\nNTA OP but your wife is. You don't get to ignore parents' rules for their kids unless they are being neglected or abused. Playing in the cold and not letting them in a neighbor's house doesn't count as either.", "This is very interesting. Can you tell us what is your culture? Thank you!", "That's a reflection on you and your worldview more than anything else.", "This you?\n\n> I live in the Midwest. I remember being a teenager so the year had to be between 2004-2007.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/eyquyx/i_cant_let_this_go", "you brought it up so yea it kinda is our business if you're gonna bring up your experiences", "You either live on sex offender block or not in our reality lol.", "I'm like this and I DO live in America. My mom didn't allow us (as children) to go into anyone's house (unless she was there with us) and I raised my children the same way. She would say you never know what goes on in people's houses.\n\nI RARELY have visitors at my house. \ud83e\udd37", "> but it is normal for our people \n\n\"Her people\" according to her own comments are midwesterners, as in Midwest of America.\n\n>> I live in the Midwest. I remember being a teenager so the year had to be between 2004-2007.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Glitch_in_the_Matrix/comments/eyquyx/i_cant_let_this_go", "LMAO \u201ctheres also a cultural element you\u2019re missing here\u201d Midwest culture is to not let anyone in your house?!?", "And now you unironically post on numerous conspiracy subreddits. Not very persuasive.", "Could be fundamentalist, Amish/Mennonite, or evangelical. All three are wary of those situations.\n\nNot precisely cultural, more theocultural. But it's a possibility. \n\nEither that or she's just embellishing things like people do on Reddit, meh.", "Dude right?\n\nMidwesterners, as a group, are probably the most overly friendly and welcoming group out of any group of Americans.", "She has 650+ comments on /r/exchristian\n\nThis sounds like new age fundamentalism tbh.\n\nOr as you say, just full of shit, which I think is most likely", "Sounds like paranoia. And this is coming from somebody who lived in a place that wasn't safe for kids."]}
