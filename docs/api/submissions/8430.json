We recently (6 months ago) moved into a new neighbourhood, with a big garden and extra-friendly neighbours, much to my wife's request. \n\nAbout two weeks ago, when I came home I noticed there were three kids in our house. They were about the same age as our kids and my wife told me they were our neighbours' kids, and that they'd met our kids when they were playing out in the snow. I brushed it off and didn't think much of it, especially since my wife told me it was pretty common for kids in this area to come over to their friends' house.\n\nThree days ago, I noticed my wife was extremely down. I asked her what happened and she said the neighbors had given her a call and said that their kids were no longer allowed to come into our house. I don't know what their problem is (they didn't really give my wife a reason for this request of theirs.) but I was like that's what they want for their kids so we should respect that.\n\nMy wife got mad at me and said if the neighbour's kids were to ask her to come in, she couldn't tell them to stay out. She's a kind person and that would be the opposite of what she'd do. I said maybe kids could go out to play together but she insisted that it is too cold for that\n\nShe also mentioned the only reason she could think of was us being a same-sex couple. I said it did not matter anyways. I told her that we should still respect our neighbour's wishes or we could go have a face to face conversation with them. My wife simply said she can't leave those kids outside if they showed up. She called me heartless for even suggesting it.\n\nSo am I really in the wrong here? They're kids and they're neighbours their house is literally on the same street as ours.", "created_utc": 1674829730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mm639/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_shouldnt_have/", "score": 707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if they're shitty, even if I disagree with them, you guys can't really step in and try to change it. It is what it is.

You're merely telling her that *she should respect the stated wishes of the kids' parents* that they not be in your house.\n\nI hope she's wrong and it's not because you're a same-sex couple. It could be that their ages are young enough that the parents don't want them in anyone else's house. Maybe the neighbors don't feel like they know you two well enough yet. I dunno.... Perhaps you & your wife should reach out to the neighbors, invite them over for coffee or something, and get to know them. That often changes things.", "Where did your wife get the idea that it's common for neighborhood kids to just go to other houses? Did your wife actually ever talk to them? It sounds like your wife is projecting her desire for an old TV suburbia. \n\n\nWhen I was a kid, I went back and forth pretty freely to my neighbor's house. But our parents were friends. Lived there before we were born, facilitated the friendships. Our parents knew that we did this. They wouldn't have wanted us to go into someone else's house.\n\n\nIt sounds like your wife just decided that it was \"common,\" and took it upon herself to invite these kids inside, not having spoken to their parents about it at all.", "NTA.

It's standard for kids to go hang out with neighbors, but it's not standard to go against the requests of another child's parents (as much as that request sucks in this instance) when it comes to this sort of thing.\n\nI think it's worth trying once or twice to make friends with these parents though, you're going to be living next to each other for a long time, and it's likely your kids will become good friends with their kids.\n\nThere's an interesting psychological trick that can help in this sort of situation - ask them if you can borrow some salt, or sugar, or something super cheap that they're likely to have. This actually makes people like you because people like feeling valued. Try something like this a couple of times, and then try inviting them round for dinner.\n\nIt could be they have some homophobic tendencies, but oftentimes this is because people just dehumanize the 'unknown' and there are plenty of stories out there of certain types of bigot actually changing their ways and becoming friends with those they were once intolerant of.\n\nMaybe that won't happen in this situation. Perhaps even probably. But if, through a small amount of effort, you give yourselves a reasonable chance to have a more ideal neighborly friendship with this people, it can improve lives for everyone involved.\n\nBut then again, I'm a straight, white, neurotypical male that hasn't had to struggle with this sort of thing so I've no idea how hard it actually is...", "NTA. If the kids show up, the correct course of action is to contact their parents or guardians. Absolutely do not let them inside without parental permission. If they call the police and say you\u2019ve kidnapped or abused their children, you will have a lot of unpleasant problems.", "NTA. The parents of these kids don't know you. You are new to the neighbourhood. You could be anyone. Children don't have the same level of awareness of danger, they just want to play. Why not invite the parents round for drinks, let them get to know you and the will start to feel more comfortable.", "I am an old hetero white male. I know things are very different today, but I see no problem with kids playing outside and not going into other people\u2019s houses. That was the norm for me growing up. We would run the block playing outside. If we needed to warm up, a bathroom break etc. we would go to our own house. Of course we were allowed in if invited by the parents.\n\nI think your wife is right about it being because you are a same sex couple, but she should still just honor the others parents wish. Although if it was a bigotry issue I would expect the neighbors to not let their children play with yours at all.\n\nUnless the neighbors show other signs of being bigoted I am going to say NAH as long as your wife respects the rules of the neighbors", "NAH - There's no objective answer here. I respect that your wife is choosing to respect these kids and be kind to them despite their parents. Maybe it's safer than their home, maybe having more adults in their life can help them. I also understand why parents wouldn't want children that young in a stranger's house, they have no way to tell if you are a threat to their children.\n\nThe right thing is going to be highly subjective, but I don't think either one of you is being an AH for your different approaches.", "NTA.

Especially one where the parents didn't invite me and my wife so the kids could play, but one that wants to just play with my kids. It just doesn't sit right.\n\nYour wife also have no idea what these kids needs are. One might be a diabetic that needs insulin, or have severe nut/gluten allergies and she's making sandwiches. The parents might have been frantically looking for their kids while they were at your house. Or it might be that they don't approve of your life's. But you simply have no way of knowing that. \n\nI think you must slow this thing down. \nInvite them for dinner and get to know each other while the kids play. Grow a friendship and once everyone is comfortable you might get where your wife wants to be.\n\nMy neighbor and I have a great relationship like that. We added a ladder on the wall so his daughter and mine can easily jump over and play in each other's back yard. Sometimes we watch the others little one when the other has errands to run.
