Some context, my husband and his brother have been funding the lifestyle of their parents & younger sister for quite some time. Initially I was supportive because I understood it was a cultural thing, but over the years it feels more like mooching than anything. I am the one who takes care of all the important stuff in the house, including finances/budgeting. We aren\u2019t talking about small amounts of money. The family has fought over money before & random (smaller) inheritances from relatives. For example, my husband\u2019s parents convinced him to give not one, but two inheritances he received from his grandparents and uncle to them. My in-laws are hard core gamblers, so I\u2019ve always been iffy about him giving them money. It got to a point where we were having some financial difficulties & I had to put an end to the funding of their lifestyle. Especially because they are both capable of working. Even his sister, who is in her early 30s, with a son, has never had a full time job. She would come to her brothers for money, but turns around & buys designer bags & shoes. I know my husband still gives them money on occasion & I look the other way, as long as it doesn\u2019t get bad again.\n\nNow my BIL\u2019s wife recently passed from cancer. Shortly before her diagnosis, both her parents had passed within a short time and left her with quite a bit of money. As my SIL went through chemo, I was mainly the one taking her to appointments & we became really close. I tried to make her end of life as fulfilling as I could. No one else from the family ever really cared about her or the situation. \n\nThe day of her funeral, we were at BIL house & immediately the conversation turned to money. Not once did my in-laws ask how their son was doing, or mention anything about my SIL. The first question out my MIL mouth was \u201cwhat did she leave you? How much did her parents leave her again?\u201d I lost it. My husband said I was overreacting, so I left. \n\nI immediately looked into changing my will & life insurance policy, so only my kids and sister get everything. I have a decent safety net stashed to the side and I am considering putting additional assets in my sister\u2019s name. I trust her with my life & she loves my kids, probably more than anything. I had savings accounts for my kids which are now in a trust only my sister will have access to until they\u2019re 18, in the event of my death. If go before my in-laws, I don\u2019t want them to get a single penny of any money that\u2019s for my kids & taking measures to ensure they are protected financially. I\u2019m also considering keeping more of my husband and my finances separate from this point forward. I am concerned only for my children & making sure my in-laws don\u2019t scam or worm their way into anything.\n\nI haven\u2019t told my husband I changed the policy, my will and moved the kids savings.

Make sure you will your husband $1 in your will, so he doesn't have room to challenge it on the basis of being \"forgotten/left out accidentally\"", "Fkn do it.", "Tell him, I bet he agrees.\nProbably will be thankful for taking that stress away from him in that situation", "NTA, but in your shoes, I would have divorced a long time ago. Your husband's priorities are all screwed up, if he's financially supporting his parents to the detriment of his own kids.\n\nAlso, I hope you have sought legal advice on writing the will in such a way that it can't be contested.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds like an enabler to your in-laws. I don\u2019t see that you have much choice if you want to protect your children\u2019s inheritance from your husband signing it away. \n\nOP, I think you are completely NTA however I\u2019m not sure how healthy this is for a long term relationship. I think seeking counseling may be necessary, but then again maybe it makes things worse if he and his parents take offense to you designing your will to only benefit your kids (and indirectly your sister). I could see once your husband informs his parents, it turns into a hell storm", "NTA.  But be aware that in many states it's not possible to fully disinherit a spouse.  Should you pass first, your husband may be able to challenge the will in court and receive a significant portion of your estate.\n\nSpeak with an Estate Attorney in your state and figure out what the laws are.  If you want to move money out of your estate.  Ask them if an Irrevocable Trust might be a good way for you to transfer funds out of your possession so that they're not subject to probate or any other situation where a surviving spouse could sue for their share.  Irrevocable trusts are considered full transfers where the assets leave your posession.  \n\nAlternately, divorce will prevent your husband from having any claim to your estate upon your passing.", "Nta. But leave him something,  like $100. This way he can't contest the will claiming he was accidentally left out. If you have any jewelry of value consider a vault box for them. Leave the code with sister", "Exactly. I understand the cultural thing of taking care of elderly as it happens in my culture as well. Generally, in such cultures the elderly spent their life savings on their kids unselfishly. Hence, the responsibility falls on children to provide financially as the parents may not have much left to look after themselves in later stages of life.\n\nOP's in laws are selfish and are using  culture as a tool to exploit their children which is a terrible behavior and should never be entertained. If the husband can't see the light, it's on him.  Please separate your finances from the abusers and protect your kids.\n\nNTA.", "You mentioned his parents being gamblers so I would look into resources concerning addiction, childhood trauma, financial abuse etc. Therapy is the best resource ever, imho, and www.outofthefog.net is a personal favorite of mine when it comes to these types of people. I hope your husband is willing to do the work to get out of the FOG (fear, obligation, guilt) and begin healing. Best of luck!", "This is correct.  OP Needs to speak to an Estate Attorney to establish a legally compliant will or, preferably, a Divorce Attorney to make the point moot.", "Why would they need the trust funds of the kids to raise them?", "To be fair, she literally has a point to do so. Qt this point she should just get him to go to couples therapy but I don't think the husband is going to agree since he gets defensive about Familial issues lol", "Hard to do that when your partner isn't being one", "You have interchanged the genders of OP and her husband. \n\nHe can raise his kids with the money he earns from his job.\n\nHis parents are not mean to her, they are money hungry and manipulative and her husband either can\u2019t see that or he chooses to ignore.", "Apparently not all of their children.       \nThe sister is as bad as the parents.", "This isn't just a cultural thing if the first thing out if your ILs mouths is\"what did the cancer victim leave you?\" It's awful and lacks empathy.", "Your husband can\u2019t be too much of a good man if you are worried he will take money from your children and give it to his parents and sister ?", "You should discuss this with an attorney.  If you\u2019re in the US, some states do not allow for a spouse to be written out of the will and will automatically calculate a minimum percentage to go to a spouse (whereas children can be written out in these states).  So just make sure that whatever you have planned, it is in line with the law and will withstand any contests. You may even want to discuss a legal separation depending on how strongly you feel - in many jurisdictions, this operates to legally separate finances, as well.", "If you\u2019re in Ontario then he can challenge the will and take what he\u2019d get in a divorce.", "An attorney will be able to show how the assets go to her sister in trust for the kids. The sister can then be gatekeeper to ensure the kiddos get the money\u2026"]}
