Some context, my husband and his brother have been funding the lifestyle of their parents & younger sister for quite some time. Initially I was supportive because I understood it was a cultural thing, but over the years it feels more like mooching than anything. I am the one who takes care of all the important stuff in the house, including finances/budgeting. We aren\u2019t talking about small amounts of money. The family has fought over money before & random (smaller) inheritances from relatives. For example, my husband\u2019s parents convinced him to give not one, but two inheritances he received from his grandparents and uncle to them. My in-laws are hard core gamblers, so I\u2019ve always been iffy about him giving them money. It got to a point where we were having some financial difficulties & I had to put an end to the funding of their lifestyle. Especially because they are both capable of working. Even his sister, who is in her early 30s, with a son, has never had a full time job. She would come to her brothers for money, but turns around & buys designer bags & shoes. I know my husband still gives them money on occasion & I look the other way, as long as it doesn\u2019t get bad again.\n\nNow my BIL\u2019s wife recently passed from cancer. Shortly before her diagnosis, both her parents had passed within a short time and left her with quite a bit of money. As my SIL went through chemo, I was mainly the one taking her to appointments & we became really close. I tried to make her end of life as fulfilling as I could. No one else from the family ever really cared about her or the situation. \n\nThe day of her funeral, we were at BIL house & immediately the conversation turned to money. Not once did my in-laws ask how their son was doing, or mention anything about my SIL. The first question out my MIL mouth was \u201cwhat did she leave you? How much did her parents leave her again?\u201d I lost it. My husband said I was overreacting, so I left. \n\nI immediately looked into changing my will & life insurance policy, so only my kids and sister get everything. I have a decent safety net stashed to the side and I am considering putting additional assets in my sister\u2019s name. I trust her with my life & she loves my kids, probably more than anything. I had savings accounts for my kids which are now in a trust only my sister will have access to until they\u2019re 18, in the event of my death. If go before my in-laws, I don\u2019t want them to get a single penny of any money that\u2019s for my kids & taking measures to ensure they are protected financially. I\u2019m also considering keeping more of my husband and my finances separate from this point forward. I am concerned only for my children & making sure my in-laws don\u2019t scam or worm their way into anything.\n\nI haven\u2019t told my husband I changed the policy, my will and moved the kids savings.

He did nothing for his dying SIL either, only you helped her. And he defended the people who didn't care about her instead of the person who actually helped, was grieving, and was his wife. He wasn't being a good person, he was either being a pushover and a coward to his parents or he just honestly agrees with them.

Imagine what a heartbreaking betrayal that would be, especially because you couldn't even confront him with it and talk it out; you'd just have to live with it, live with knowing that your husband didn't trust you and never told you. Or, imagine finding out somehow, again years down the line but while he was still alive and not from him; do you think your marriage would survive it? It doesn't matter how justified your concerns are \u2013 and I absolutely agree that they are valid \u2013 but you yourself said that you don't trust your husband; you said that you don't trust him financially, but that means *you also don't trust him to prioritize and care appropriately for your children.* Lack of trust is corrosive to a marriage. In fact, I'd probably recommend marriage counseling, and telling him in the course of that, with the counselor present, because this is going to be a huge blow to him \u2013 but you really can't justify hiding it from him.", "This.
