If the baby suffers for her own decisions, it's time for CPS, not endless charity.", "I don't see where you did anything you might be worried about, so NTA.  Nobody is an asshole for their feelings.\n\nThat said, I think it's a little unfair of you to expect your sister-in-law to hide exciting things happening in her life just because her celebrating might not have synergy with your own celebrations.

You did nothing wrong and lingering over your internal dialogue does nothing but cause you extra stress. You are not a terrible person for thinking this way.\n\nIf Leah cannot support her child, then that isn\u2019t your fault either. She absolutely chose to get pregnant, is choosing to keep it, and is choosing to bring a child into a poor situation. This is, without a doubt, not your circus. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be guilted into giving handouts you know won\u2019t ever stop. Let her mother and her boyfriend supply her, and if they can\u2019t, let it be a sharp reality check when she finds out being the golden child can\u2019t magically float her through life.

Try to get therapy for your boyfriend. Maybe online. So he can deal with his feelings about his family and understand that he is not the problem. It will reduce his stress especially now with a baby.

And you may want a second child, so will of course be keeping everything for that baby.\n\nI understand that you don't want an innocent baby to suffer - it won't. Your MIL *will* cough up the cash. There are countless charities and swap sites that your SIL can go through. The only reason she comes to you first is because you always say yes, but that needs to end now.

The baby you need to worry about is your own. Your SIL is older than you and has a support network (mom) that your husband doesn\u2019t have. Unless you and your boyfriend are rolling in dough, unlike most people your age, you need to put your funds toward taking care of your own baby. You will need to spend money on things you may not even have thought of yet, like \n\n* life insurance in a pretty good amount to care for your child if something happens to you;\n* attorney fees to get wills drawn up and provide for guardianship, hopefully not with the golden child or her mom;\n* maybe a bigger place to live;\n* college fund for your child.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to give away your baby furniture because you will need most of it for a two or three years. Depending on what you bought, you may use some of this stuff for longer. By the time you are finished with it, SIL\u2019s child shouldn\u2019t need it either since they are so close in age. And you may have another child on the way.\n\nYou should not begrudge your SIL her baby announcement. However, I share your concerns about a decision to have a child when you already can\u2019t pay the heat bill. Your concern for your SIL\u2019s child, however, should not cause you to contribute. Instead of mooching off family, SIL and her husband should sign up for benefits like SNAP, medical services, and even low-income housing. Or get jobs. Lots of people work a full time job plus a part time job.", "NTA If they can't pay their bills now, they are going to be a financial black hole when the kid's born. I think it will be important for you to pretend that you're really broke and ask them for money!", "I'm hijacking the first post to add that when SIL starts asking for the baby's furniture and other big stuff, OP and her husband should be an united front and tell SIL that they don't want to give any of those things yet in case they want to have another baby in the future because sadly SIL is the golden child and probably already feel entitled to those things and wouldn't take a NO from OP and hubs.  \n\n\nForgot to add NTA", "I had a bad experience in loaning two baby dresses out, and that gave me the necessary spine to tell people No, I don't loan anything unless I'm okay with it being damaged or not coming back. It's not that I don't trust you, it's that literally anything can happen and I don't want any strain on my relationships due to *items*. If they act like they don't understand or accept my decision, I just shrug and get on with life. Learning that No can be a complete sentence was very freeing. \n\nOP has done well not being a shit-stirrer, now she just needs to start setting herself up to succeed in keeping the leechy behavior off her own small family. Harry has *got* to do the work on himself as well, OP can't always be the lone Guardian at the Gate.", "This. My SIL got pregnant just a few weeks after I did. She announced it at the same time we did. On her part there was a little bit of competition because we were both having boys and whichever was born first would be the 1st grandson (which in dh's family is a big deal). They ended up being born only 3 weeks apart so they were often treated like twins when the family got together. \n\nWe were also the \"poor ones\" of the family because I was a SAHM. We asked for nothing but I know there was a lot of silent judgment on their part about whether we should have a 2nd child on only one income. \n\nSo while you're entitled to your feelings about her digs this is not a competition. Enjoy your baby and ignore her. If she asks for money the answer is \"sorry, we are taking care of our family and don't have any extra.\" Don't elaborate on that. \n\nSince she's the golden child her parents will help her out anyways. \n\nSlight YTA based on being upset about when she announced it. You knew they were trying before you ever got pregnant so you know she didn't get pregnant just to upstage you. I don't think there would ever be a good time for her to have announced it in your eyes. Based on your post you enjoy judging her and finding fault with her.", "Agree with this comment.", "God this comment hit me really hard. I\u2019ve been avoiding that thought but honestly you\u2019re completely right. I just don\u2019t see a world where our kid will be treated with the same enthusiasm. I\u2019m thankful my family are as supportive as they are (and adore Harry). \nBut we\u2019re actually in a tough situation with telling his mom about when I give birth. We don\u2019t have a car at the minute and my mom is too far away to pick us up quickly so our only option is to tell MIL and have her take us to the hospital as she\u2019s much more local", "We\u2019re very much on the same page with giving out our purchased items but I\u2019m worried once they start pressuring him, he\u2019ll relent and offer stuff. That being said it\u2019s all hypothetical but I can definitely see it happening. MIL isn\u2019t in the best financial spot herself so I\u2019m not even sure realistically how much help she\u2019ll be either \ud83d\ude15", "This has opened my eyes a bit. There\u2019s probably some level of truth to that", "Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t have that sort of money to support her daughter either, that\u2019s why I\u2019m pretty confident in saying they\u2019ll both turn to us to lend her our items", "Also there isn't enough of a gap in ages for this to be a real problem. Most of the big items will still be in use when her baby is born so they can just say they still need it. Very little baby furniture is going to be not needed when the baby is barely 9/10 months old.", "Can you afford to buy a car? Or rent one for a few weeks.", "Just say sorry you\u2019re saving them for your second baby. It might or might not be true but who cares. Or if not \u2018sorry I already sold it\u2019. You should get her to look at bundles of baby clothes on eBay or fb marketplace as that\u2019s way more economical than buying it all new.", "Everything they ask you for, say NO. \u201cCan you..\u201d NO! \u201cWill you\u2026\u201d NO! Block them, go NC. Move, if you can and don\u2019t give out your new address to anyone that is in contact with them. Your MIL and SIL are grown adults- it\u2019s up to them to figure it out without relying on you.", "We live in a rural area so renting agencies are extremely few and far between especially as we could be renting it for potentially 3wks", "Tricky. If you can afford a car could be worth the investment as there a lot of appointments/doctors trips with a baby and if you MIL is likely to unreliable it could be a lifesaver.", "It\u2019s very true. Though our maternity unit is only 15 minute away from where we live, I have a lot of anxiety of the thought of our baby needing urgent care and the hospital is too far away especially without immediate transport. It\u2019s definitely a discussion we need to talk about more"]}
