They weren\u2019t in the best place but I knew it wasn\u2019t my place to say.\n\nFast forward 3 months and surprise! IM PREGNANT! Yes this was an oops baby but we\u2019re steady, got a house, savings & we\u2019re jumping for joy when we found out. Everyone was so ecstatic when we announced it, but Leah\u2019s first reaction was complaining that Harry always beats her to milestones in life. This really struck a chord with me. To preface, Harry\u2019s family aren\u2019t supportive towards him. They only have their mom and throughout Harry\u2019s whole life Leah was clearly the favourite & his mom would gladly say it in front of him with no shame. She\u2019s the embodiment of \u2018the golden child that could do no wrong\u2019. This has left him with insecurities and rejected feelings into adulthood but he struggles to talk to them about it because it never leads anywhere. I have truly never seen a family treat someone they\u2019re supposed to love like this. Anyways.\n\nLeah being upset we \u2018beat her\u2019 put a bad taste in my mouth but I kept quiet as I didn\u2019t want to disturb the peace. This came up a few times over the months but I managed to ignore the digs being made and comfort Harry.\n\nI\u2019m now 39wks pregnant. We've bought all the baby's stuff ourselves and are excited to meet her\ud83d\udc95 I\u2019m so proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished. That was until Leah announced she was pregnant a couple of days ago. We immediately congratulated her and bought her a hamper for the first trimester as we knew she couldn\u2019t afford much.

They\u2019d only told us last week they couldn\u2019t afford to have the heating on at all because they were already in debt to their gas supplier too.\n\nThis is where I feel like the AH. I\u2019ve had my family strongly warn me that Leah will start asking for financial support & ask for our baby furniture once she\u2019s further along. They\u2019re also saying that it was purposeful of Leah to not wait for us to have our baby before announcing hers as this behaviour is extremely common for her. She has really struggled to cope with Harry having any sort of spotlight from their mom and honestly I agree. Over the past couple days their mom was already back to practically ignoring him. I\u2019m upset Leah didn\u2019t just wait a week. I\u2019m jaded by the way my partner has been treated over the years. I\u2019m dreading Leah asking for our baby\u2019s first items.

The next time they bring up money you state clearly that you have your own child to raise and are not in the position to lend out one dime. Period. No guilt, no thinking about it. No. They will stop asking after you make it clear the well is dry.", "I understand you feel like you have to help but then it will never stop. Yes the baby is innocent but you are not the irresponsible ones and should not financially support them.\n\nharry also need therapy for his emotional abuse he has grown up with. I would go LC with all of them.", "NTA. You reacted appropriately, but you kept it private. You dissembled successfully to her.\n\nYou owe Leah nothing. You are not her parent. If she asks for (or demands) anything from you, a simple NO suffices. If the baby suffers for her own decisions, it's time for CPS, not endless charity.", "I don't see where you did anything you might be worried about, so NTA.  Nobody is an asshole for their feelings.\n\nThat said, I think it's a little unfair of you to expect your sister-in-law to hide exciting things happening in her life just because her celebrating might not have synergy with your own celebrations.  It's not like she announced it in the middle of your event or while you were in labor.  More than one exciting thing can happen in a week.", "NTA, as it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve expressed your feelings to Leah or MIL, which would probably cause lots of drama. \n\nYou can\u2019t be held responsible for their baby though. If she starts asking for stuff, either you aren\u2019t ready to part with it or you are saving it for any more children you may decide to have down the road. And no, it can\u2019t be \u201con loan\u201d because what if you both end up pregnant again at the same time? It stays at your house until you decide otherwise. \n\nGet Harry to see a therapist. You didn\u2019t mention much about his dynamic in the family other than how they treat him, but I suspect he will probably try to do a lot to \u201cearn their approval\u201d, perhaps to the detriment of your little family. It will also help him to learn some coping mechanisms as your baby grows- I\u2019m sure his mom\u2019s treatment of him might accidentally come off poorly in his own parenting.", "NTA\n\nYou are under no obligation to provide anything for Leah's baby.  The thing is that it's not like you are going to be able to give much to Leah anyway.... because your own baby will still be using it ie the cot, the pram.\n\nAnd you might want to keep the things you don't want wrecked or never returned... for your next baby.\n\nI would actually consider not announcing the birth of your child to your husbands family for a few days.  Let your husband enjoy learning about his child before he's disappointed by his family's reaction to the news... because, let's face it, they aren't going to be that ecstatic about your child's birth like they will about Leah's child's birth.  Sad as that is.", "Don\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll soon get over that guilt when MIL starts supporting Leah while ignoring your baby. By giving Leah your baby stuff you are basically taking things from your own child since you can sell those things to by the next thing he needs. Leah will nag for those things then sell them. NTA", "NTA. Leah is having the baby as a bid for attention to \u2018win\u2019 her sibling, which is pathetic. Sad for baby, but not really your business. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be expected to support her pregnancy/aftercare just because she can\u2019t afford it. Mummy dearest is there for her golden child anyway. You and spouse don\u2019t NOT be guilt tripped into providing for her just because your baby is \u2018just a bit older\u2019! \n\nCongratulations and I wish you a smooth delivery!", "NTA and it\u2019s interesting that so often the golden child is incapable of being self-sufficient and the ignored or despised kid is the one who has the gumption to stand on their own two feet and take care of themselves.", "NTA. They announced they were going to try for a baby before you got pregnant, so what was their plan for providing for the child? They didn\u2019t know you would have baby items. She hasn\u2019t asked yet and she might not. But just tell her that you can\u2019t spare anything and let her mother help her. Just make sure Harry is on the same page - his mother and sister might try guilting him into helping if they get nowhere with you.", "NTA.  You are going to have your hands too full in a week or two to worry at all about Leah.  You don't owe Leah your baby stuff... realistically, with babies 8 or 9 months apart you're still going to be using all of it anyhow.  If she asks, you just say no.  No is a complete sentence.  \n\nCongrats and enjoy your time with your new baby and don't let any feelings about your ILs rob you of your happiness.", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all, congratulations. \n\nSecond, you need to go LC with all these people for your own sake as well as the well-being of your BF. \n\nWhich brings us to the third thing. Say no. No, you aren't supporting SIL financially.  No, you aren't giving her your baby items. No, you aren't responsible for her child at all. No, you shouldn't feel guilty or allow others to guilt you for saying no. \n\n*You* have your own child you need to focus on and care about.

This post feels like you\u2019re less concerned about your own reaction and more concerned about looking like TA if you nipped the financial manipulation in the bud and told her \u201cno\u201d. If that\u2019s the case, then still NTA. \n\nYou and your own come first. Leah\u2019s poor decisions are Leah\u2019s poor decisions. In regard to your initial reaction, you were polite, kept your opinion to yourself, and made a socially acceptable level gift as a congratulations. You did nothing wrong and lingering over your internal dialogue does nothing but cause you extra stress. You are not a terrible person for thinking this way.\n\nIf Leah cannot support her child, then that isn\u2019t your fault either. She absolutely chose to get pregnant, is choosing to keep it, and is choosing to bring a child into a poor situation. This is, without a doubt, not your circus. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be guilted into giving handouts you know won\u2019t ever stop. Let her mother and her boyfriend supply her, and if they can\u2019t, let it be a sharp reality check when she finds out being the golden child can\u2019t magically float her through life. If you become that concerned about the child\u2019s welfare, call child services and leave it at that. It\u2019s not your business.\n\nIt might also be a good idea to sit down with your boyfriend and explain this. Giving that he\u2019s already vulnerable due to his family\u2019s treatment of him, it might be far more difficult down the road for him to say \u201cno\u201d. Start bracing him for the spectacular disaster that will be coming when he has to say it and make sure he knows you have his back 100%. \n\nCongratulations on the small human!", "NTA but please try not to take their anything personally. Yeah you probably will pass on things once you are done with them but by then you\u2019ll be done with them and ready to pass them on. You\u2019re tampering your experience by focusing on tomorrows that aren\u2019t here yet. Stay present for this, you\u2019ll be glad you did when it\u2019s over. \n\nAs per your worry about their lack of responsible living\u2026 it\u2019s been my observation that becoming a parent IS the make it or break moment in maturing. Set a good example and cheer them on if you really want to make a difference in their lives but also your own and the baby. \n\nIt\u2019s stress you don\u2019t need, not have to take on right now. Wearing sweaters because they don\u2019t have heat won\u2019t hurt them. Everyone alive. \n\nNow go get ready to hit that proverbial brick wall that is the transformation from maiden to mother. lol\n\nYou\u2019re a good sister to worry.", "NTA. Try to get therapy for your boyfriend. Maybe online. So he can deal with his feelings about his family and understand that he is not the problem. It will reduce his stress especially now with a baby. The way to deal with her is to firmly say \"sorry we also have expenses with a new baby so we don't have anything to spare\". Keep repeating. But you must be on the same page with your boyfriend. Make sure they have no access to your house. Like keys.", "NTA op but don't help them out in anyway, no money, no materials, no nothing, you already gave them a congratulatory gift, and u can give them occasional gifts, but please don't give them anything extra. Once they ask and you give, it will become a lifelong thing, and they will keep expecting too much from you, if they ask for your used stuffs, give if u need to, or if u are planning for another child, store it safely for the future.", "NTA\n\nLet her have this week - you'll have the baby soon and she can't steal the thunder twice. You'll be far too busy with your lovely bundle of joy to care what she's doing.\n\nBut be very firm about not giving her anything. Say *now* that all of this stuff is sentimental to you and you won't be able to part with any of it. And you may want a second child, so will of course be keeping everything for that baby.\n\nI understand that you don't want an innocent baby to suffer - it won't. Your MIL *will* cough up the cash. There are countless charities and swap sites that your SIL can go through. The only reason she comes to you first is because you always say yes, but that needs to end now. You have your own child to care for, and your child will always come first. If they really can't afford their child, you're actually making things worse and more long-lasting by bailing them out just before things reach a point where CPS will step in.", "get harry into therapy and go \"no contact\" or \"low contact\"", "NTA you are a champ. Babies are expensive, blah blah blah.  No is a complete sentence. Also, get some family counseling so your husband to let go of his family as it\u2019s only going to become more and more of an issue.", "NTA\n\nMy SIL asked if we had the mamaroo that came with the house or another swing. I said no, we gave away the mamaroo to our neighbors for their baby and I'm not sure about the other swing. It's in our attic, our kids like to sit in it and swing. Plus it's busted. \n\nShe asked again, I told her we have one but it's broken and I'm not giving it away anyway. She sounded upset but oh well. I'm not giving out hand outs from my kids things.", "Yeah. Why stress about how she will act in the future. \n\nPlan to say no!\n\nLie. We are struggling too. Kids are expensive. I totally understand how you feel! Hugs!!", "This is the answer, OP. Harry needs help getting over this and to work his way out of seeking the love/approval he didn't get. You can't take care of people when you're about to birth another person who needs you more than they need handouts. If they're truly in a bad way, there are tons of charities/churches/community centers/etc. out there looking for people to assist. NTA for taking care of your family first.\n\n\\*edit spelling", "Honestly, endless charity doesn't always help the innocent child anyway. Sometimes it delays the inevitable and makes the child suffer needlessly longer.\n\nOP, just say no. You have your own child to provide finances for not just in the now but there future too. Don't let your child suffer financially trying to help the people who have caused the father of your child to suffer emotionally his whole life. I think it time for your husband to think about LC and NC options with his family and therapy to start healing himself.", "Agreed, if she'd waited until right after OP's baby was born that would probably have been worse. Or OP would have still thought it was terrible.", "I\u2019ve found that too, I guess because the less liked kid has learned they can\u2019t depend on family like the other child. Too much support on the other hand leads to complacency and they never get anywhere truly meaningful", "Sadly he\u2019s tried therapy a few times since he was a teen and it\u2019s never worked out for him. He\u2019s even tried cognitive behavioural therapy but it never really helped or he was just given more antidepressants. I have no idea how to help :("]}
