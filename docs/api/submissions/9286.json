Recently, one of my sisters (31f) asked to temporarily move in with us because of repairs being done to her home, which is not up to code. She has a husband (31m) and a son (10m). \n\nMy nephew is not a good kid, he\u2019s a bully and frequently misbehaves. However, I decided to let her family stay anyways.\n\nOur 13 y/o is autistic, he\u2019s a very bright boy and actually quite popular, but he still struggles with sensory issues, social interactions, ect. As I mentioned, he\u2019s still popular and social, mainly because he\u2019s an athlete. Our son plays baseball and lacrosse and is friends with the popular group of athlete boys in his school. These boys do everything together, they hang out pretty much every day until bedtime, they help each other with homework, play video games, ect. It\u2019s really sweet how close they are. The boys helped manage my son\u2019s successful run for school president and are always each other\u2019s biggest supporters. Our son is closer to these boys then he is to family, our son doesn\u2019t like hugs, except for these boys, he tells them secrets he doesn\u2019t tell family. \n\nMy nephew seems to have an issue with this, and has pushed my son\u2019s boundaries since arriving.\n\nYesterday, I was dropping of my son at one of his friend\u2019s houses. The boy he is friends with collects all sorts of stuff, including fragile busts of athletes. My sister and her son decided to tag along with us while dropping him off. It turns out that my nephew is in the same class as this boy\u2019s sister. Judging from the stories I\u2019ve heard, my son\u2019s friend\u2019s sister is also a little terror. My son went with his friend, my nephew with his friend, while we sat in the car talking to the mom of the boy and girl. \n\nWhile we were sitting, the boys come rushing out to tell us that while they had left the room to go in kitchen, my nephew went in the boy\u2019s room and was touching with stuff, he ended up breaking 2 busts. Thankfully, with the boys help, we found replacements online and bough them. The total cost came to around $500, which their parents could afford, but so could my sister. My sister said she didn\u2019t want to pay for them because she didn\u2019t want to make her son feel bad for making his mom have to pay for this. The other mom went in the house, while we argued in the car. I told her that if she didn\u2019t pay back, she\u2019d have to find someone else to stay with, so she ended up forking over the money. She told her son about it and he said we were being unfair and this wouldn\u2019t have happened if my son and his friends just \u201cdid what I say\u201d. My sister is still upset at me and some of our siblings have chimed in to take her side, saying I was being too punitive on her son.

Smh.", "Sounds like a future cop in training.", "oh you can do punitive on top of that because of lack of parental oversight etc, but that is neither here nor there for now.", " She's ultimately responsible for what he did.", "Sure, I'm just saying that in this case it's not about punishment, it's about paying what you owe.", "He went into the room while the boy it belongs to went to the kitchen, to me that sounds like there was no reason for him to be there and he was not invited to come in.", "agreed", "Could be. There were a whole group of boys over there - hanging out in the kid's bedroom definitely isn't uncommon.\n\nI don't think OP did anything wrong, but I still think there can be issues when making snap judgments and not slowing down long enough to communicate. It's easy to see how this might have gone from zero to \"you need to pay the $500\" and everything after that was going to be tuned out.\n\nWe're hearing OP's recall of the story, which includes the nephew saying this went down in an unfair way. Over $500, someone should ask him what he means by that. If it's bullshit, then it can just be discarded.", "There was no whole group of boys over there hanging out, there was two 13 year old boys hanging out and a 10 year old boy hanging out with a girl from his own class. And since he went into the room when the older boys left, they were obviously not hanging out together in that room before since then he would have already been in the room.", "You weren't there and are making loads of assumptions about how the whole thing went down.\n\nYou're absolutely proving my point about why it is important to slow down and actually communicate instead of making snap decisions like this.\n\nOP and sister are probably both assuming very different ideas of what actually transpired.", "It says in the text that the nephews friend is a girl and that her son went with his friend and her nephew went with his friend (the girl). So it actually says it was not a bunch of boys hanging out but two boys hanging out and a boy and a girl hanging out.  \nIt also says in the text that the nepehew was not in the room when OPs son and his friend were in there but went in after they left to go to the kitchen. So if they were not in the same room, how exactly were they hangign out together? The only person making assumptions or actually inventing stuff directly contradicting the text, is you...", "You're a strange character. I'm talking about slowing down for OP to find out what really happened. You're talking about headcount between boys and girls at the house. Who cares?", "You are making up a whole group of boys that were hanging out together when there was no whole group of boys and they were not hanging out together. I find that pretty strange.", "NTA. If your sister doesn\u2019t stop his behaviour now then he will grow up to be a nightmare. She\u2019s basically teaching him that he can do what he wants and have no consequences because his mum will protect him, and it won\u2019t just stop at breaking things.", "So so NTA. Her boy broke $500 worth of items. And  says  she \"didn't want to make him feel bad\"?? Don't offer her to stay at your house again. Her problems aren't your problems.", "NTA. But don't expect this to be the last thing the little AH breaks.  Hope they move out soon.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re tolerant enough to let your sister and her family live with you. You must be a saint.", "NTA. She's an enabler and she's setting her son up to be a toxic human being. If she doesn't pay for it, kick her ass out.\n\nETA: actually, kick her ass out anyway. You don't need that around your family.", "NTA. Wow. W o w. Your sister is enabling this kid and he will learn the hard way how life treats bullies.", "Mostly NTA.  \nI would never knowingly allow a bully to live under my roof, which is why I say mostly not. Even temporarily. I'd have made her pay for it and then make her find other accommodations. I'd tell your sister that her a-hole kid isn't welcome back until he learns how to respect others and their belongings too and neither is she until she learns why and does something about it. Your house. Your rules. Plus you \"hoped\" this wouldn't go badly but you also knew it would likely go something like this.", "NTA. The nephew thought the boys should just do what he says? He should absolutely be made to feel bad for making his mother have to pay for it. And his mother should be mad at him and have given him additional consequences. And you should be reconsidering whether they can stay with you if it happens again - and you should tell your sister and her family that in advance of anything else happening.", "Asking someone to pay for damages they cause is totally appropriate \n\nBut...\nYou should read back the way you describe other children. Are you sure you aren't the bully?", "I guess we know why he's a terror.\nNTA", "NTA - you break you buy. It\u2019s that simple.", "NTA\n\nYour nephew SHOULD feel bad that his mom has to pay for it, but he doesn't. He's obviously been trained by his mother to believe that nothing is his fault and nothing is off limits to him. I'd send them packing whether she paid for his damage or not.", "Nta, if your sister thinks her child's behavior is acceptable, she better get used to forking over money.", "NTA she expected you to pay to replace items her son broke? The entitlement is strong in this one...", "NTA, but your sister and nephew are major assholes. This is the kind of shit that would make me cut someone out of my life, but you sound a lot nicer than I am, probably.", "Honestly, I\u2019d be putting cameras up in my house because who knows what he or his mother are going to break, damage, or whatever else in your house now that they\u2019re mad at you. With that evidence, if it happens, I\u2019d be sending them a bill.", "NTA.  Two parties are at fault here. Nephew who broke the items and sister who hasn't taught son right from wrong. \n\n1: Nephew went into the other boy's room while the boy was out. Obviously wasn't invited.\n\n2: No one is disputing that he broke it\n\n3: Breaking something just because someone \"wasn't doing what he said\" is no reason to break something. \n\n4: Kid should feel bad for making his mom pay for something he broke, obviously on purpose because he didn't get his way. Next step should be for mom to make the kid earn money to pay mom back for what he broke. Then he wouldn't have to feel bad for making mom pay for it.\n\n5: Kid is a bully. Apparently, mom never taught him not to be, so maybe he will actually learn something from this if he has to pay mom back.", "NTA", "Honestly. YTA for allowing this demon child who keeps pushing your son\u2019s boundaries to continue staying in the same house. Put your own kid first", "NTA", "I\u2019m on the spectrum and I have ADHD- speaking from personal experience I\u2019d advise you to kick your sister out of your house immediately. Your son and his sense of security hangs in the balance", "Obviously this. But also if you want to raise your child to be a terror and not want him to feel bad about this just\u2026don\u2019t tell him. Bullshit flowing out her her in every direction", "It will. That mom's never going to do anything about it. We will see this kid on the news some day after he's beaten some innocent person to death.", "Manners? This is so far beyond manners.", "I would have paid it because I brought them there and this is not something I would have put on my son's friends parents to deal with. It sounds like OP's son has an amazing group of friends and I would not jeopardize that over money. I'd put the bully out of my house though, he wouldn't have been there to start with actually.", "He did something  wrong, and he SHOULD feel bad. That's how we learn  not to do bad things. NTA,  but the sister is.", "Oh, I don't think she had to worry...there's NO WAY that kids is going to feel bad. NTA.", "How is it being punitive to pay for a replacement for an object that her son destroyed", "That's what I was thinking, tbh, poor kid", "That's my thought, I wouldn't bring a bully into a house with my child(ren), family or no.", "This will only get worse. The siblings taking her side can definitely house her.", "talk about punitive\u2026the nephew admitted that he broke the busts because the other two boys didnt do \u201cwhat he said\u201d\u2026it wasnt even a accident, he did it on purpose. unless im reading that wrong."]}
