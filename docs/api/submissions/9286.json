Recently, one of my sisters (31f) asked to temporarily move in with us because of repairs being done to her home, which is not up to code. She has a husband (31m) and a son (10m). \n\nMy nephew is not a good kid, he\u2019s a bully and frequently misbehaves. However, I decided to let her family stay anyways.\n\nOur 13 y/o is autistic, he\u2019s a very bright boy and actually quite popular, but he still struggles with sensory issues, social interactions, ect. As I mentioned, he\u2019s still popular and social, mainly because he\u2019s an athlete. Our son plays baseball and lacrosse and is friends with the popular group of athlete boys in his school. These boys do everything together, they hang out pretty much every day until bedtime, they help each other with homework, play video games, ect. It\u2019s really sweet how close they are. The boys helped manage my son\u2019s successful run for school president and are always each other\u2019s biggest supporters. Our son is closer to these boys then he is to family, our son doesn\u2019t like hugs, except for these boys, he tells them secrets he doesn\u2019t tell family. \n\nMy nephew seems to have an issue with this, and has pushed my son\u2019s boundaries since arriving.\n\nYesterday, I was dropping of my son at one of his friend\u2019s houses. The boy he is friends with collects all sorts of stuff, including fragile busts of athletes. My sister and her son decided to tag along with us while dropping him off. It turns out that my nephew is in the same class as this boy\u2019s sister. Judging from the stories I\u2019ve heard, my son\u2019s friend\u2019s sister is also a little terror. My son went with his friend, my nephew with his friend, while we sat in the car talking to the mom of the boy and girl. \n\nWhile we were sitting, the boys come rushing out to tell us that while they had left the room to go in kitchen, my nephew went in the boy\u2019s room and was touching with stuff, he ended up breaking 2 busts. Thankfully, with the boys help, we found replacements online and bough them. The total cost came to around $500, which their parents could afford, but so could my sister. My sister said she didn\u2019t want to pay for them because she didn\u2019t want to make her son feel bad for making his mom have to pay for this. The other mom went in the house, while we argued in the car. I told her that if she didn\u2019t pay back, she\u2019d have to find someone else to stay with, so she ended up forking over the money. She told her son about it and he said we were being unfair and this wouldn\u2019t have happened if my son and his friends just \u201cdid what I say\u201d. My sister is still upset at me and some of our siblings have chimed in to take her side, saying I was being too punitive on her son.
