My \u201cfriend\u201d of 12+ years allowed me to stay with them temporarily, and we\u2019d planned on me taking over her lease when she moved 11/30. She has no car and no job (relevant later) but gets severance pay and has made a couple hundred bucks with things I\u2019ve set up for her. I took her grocery shopping, and let her hold a copy of my car key, in case she needed to use my car while I was sleeping or with a date (which she did). \n\nI got a unionized job quickly with good pay and benefits. I asked the friend if she wanted to make some $$ before she left, she said yes, and I had her hired on. \n\nWe carpooled to work everyday, since we lived together. 2 days into working together, I learned my best friend of 20+ years was in the hospital with a perforated bowel and a serious case of sepsis. If you know about either of those things, they\u2019re potentially deadly.\n\nI told my \u201croommate\u201d I\u2019d be leaving work early to be at my best friend\u2019s bedside before she went into surgery. I asked if she wanted me to take her home early, she said no, I should go and she understands fully. \n\nThe hospital my best friend\u2019s at is 60mi away. When I PARKED at the hospital, the \u201cfriend\u201d / roommate said she couldn\u2019t find anyone to drive her home and expected me to turn around to take her. Mind you, the job and house are both on transit.\n\nShe told me \u201cthe only reason I took this job was because I knew we\u2019d be riding together and I could have just stayed home\u201d. I said there\u2019s buses, trains, Uber, Lyft, and that I wasn\u2019t going to prioritize driving her home over seeing my severely ill best friend, and to not act like her taking the job was beneficial to me. \n\nShe said that\u2019s what she\u2019ll do, and to get my sh*t out of her house. I came back after visiting hours were up, and she said she couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d \u201cdo her like that\u201d. I told her she was acting like a toddler and that I\u2019m not solely responsible for getting her around, as she\u2019s 33yo and this was an emergency. I\u2019ve been the only one to visit her at the hospital & since I\u2019m estranged from my family, my best friend is really all I have. \n\nShe said she \u201cdidn\u2019t have her wallet\u201d (which was a lie) and I said you could have asked me for an Uber or left early like I\u2019d suggested. She also DIDNT MENTION any of this before I left. \n\nShe said I should have offered to get the Uber, I responded that \u201cyou told me you\u2019d work it out, and I trusted that you would.\u201d\nAnyway.

Sheesh, this girl needs a reality check. She is an adult, she should be more than capable of independently transporting herself to and from her place of employment. These are like bare minimum life skills. Instead of taking responsibility for herself and her choices she has decided to make herself the victim and throw a temper tantrum. You have done absolutely nothing wrong here.", "NTA. This person isn\u2019t a friend and certainly isn\u2019t someone I\u2019d live with or do favors for ever again.", "Absolutely NTA. You've been generous at every turn, landed her a job, made sure she was ok before you left for the hospital in a completely dire emergency, and now she's spitting the dummy. What did she think would happen if you had a sick day, or anything else? I'm very sorry for the position this has put you in, but this definitely doesn't sound like a friend, or anyone to keep around.", "NTA, she is , and an ungrateful one at that. It's her loss, make sure you get your key back from her, and look for another place.", "NTA.  She's a grown adult that doesn't seem to function on her own.  That's not your problem.", "NTA. Sooooooooooo not the asshole. You offered to get her home early, she declined without bothering to assess her options. Be glad you found this out about  her. \n\nI'm sorry for your housing issue though. Good luck.", "NTA - She sounds like a 'delightful' mix of delusional and self-centered. You did what you needed to do, and she's just being REALLY unreasonable. It's not like you didn't tell her, or give her the option before you left", "Nope, definitely NTA. You did her favor after favor and gave her fair warning. What more could she possibly ask for? Even if you hadn't, given that you were visiting a friend in the hospital, it still wouldn't have been reasonable for her to be upset. Her refusal to take any responsibility seems extraordinary. Beyond that, she sounds a bit heartless.", "Of course NTA. And crazy behaviour comes along with crazy people. Was she a reasonable, decent friend before this situation?", "NTA She is an adult. You did nothing wrong. At least you haven't signed a lease that would have tied you to her for a long time.", "NTA, and you probably have legal grounds to stay in the house/apt until you find a place properly.", "NTA. You help her get to work because you sound like a nice person that wants to help out. You're not her personal chauffeur. You're allowed to have emergencies and you even offered her an early ride home. She needs to grow tf up. She has money, she can get a ride home.", "NTA. 100% NTA. She sounds like a jealous woman who's upset you went to another woman's bedside. If you had just left work saying nothing then you'd be the jerk but you gave her an option to leave and she said no. She is fully grown and can figure it out then. Not on you.", "NTA\n\nSome people need to be a victim, if they are not they will take offence at a friend's slight inconvience to make them the enemy.", "NTA- even if you weren\u2019t going to visit your seriously ill friend in the hospital you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. You let her know you wouldn\u2019t be able to drop her home and you offered her an alternative (which she declined). It\u2019s ultimately her responsibility to get herself home.", "NTA - Sounds like you are better off without her. Not sure how she was planning on getting a new place if she didn't have a stable income beyond severance. Most places require proof of income/employment. My guess is that she was going to have you take over the lease (and payments) and then she was going to live with you for free - because she did that for you, right? But in this case, with no end date in site. Not sure how the current situation plays into that, but I wouldn't be surprised if she lets you back in because \"she is such a good person\" and she's sure you will make it up to her. Altogether just making you feel like the bad guy that owes her things, and then she will collect.", "On no planet in the galaxy are you wicked for this. NTA. If her friends think otherwise this is only going to bite them on the behind when she starts treating them the same way.\n\nWishing a smooth recovery to your friend and hoping you and your dog find new accomodation soon.", "NTA. You offered to take your friend home early. There are other ways she could get home. You weren\u2019t partying or going shopping, you were at the hospital with a friend who was in a serious situation. It\u2019s not like you left her on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere. Good grief.", "NTA\n\nSince when do you need your wallet for Lyft or Uber? That's all on the phone. Kicking you out that fast and her attitude before makes it feel like she was looking for a reason to kick you out.", "> Her friends think I\u2019m a wicked bitch.\n\nEither she's feeding them lies about what happened or there is something massive that is missing from your story. \n\nFrom what we can read, clearly NTA. How can someone be so petty and ungrateful towards someone (1) who is doing them so many favors and (2) who has an emergency? It's such a disgusting reaction.", "NTA\n\nWhy cant she get herself home? She agreed to make her own arrangements so why expect you to turn around and collect her after?\n\nIf she was a minor, I'd be more inclined to agree with her but 33?!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
