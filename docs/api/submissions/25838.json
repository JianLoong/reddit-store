I was young, naive, and much easier to manipulate (early 20s). I fell for the guilt trip but learned a valuable lesson to monitor my credit. I wish I would've reported the identify theft instead of paying it off over 5 years. She never really apologized and even had the audacity to ask me to co-sign a loan a few years later.

Stealing your identity can cause serious harm and its a shame when a parent does it.", "NTA.

Mom can call an Uber.", "NTA I hate this shit my mom did that same shit to me, her sister fucked up her credit so she opened up one on my name and ss, while she used some for me like buying both of us a phone and helping pay my college I didn't realize it was under my fucking name and credit. Most of it she used for bills and utilities, but it took me 5 years to pay it off, and my credit was fucked, and she didn't pay a dime to help me pay this shit off. Whenever I bring it up she gets fucking pissed like it wasn't a shitty thing to do to her own child and we argue a lot but I still live with my parents so I can't do anything.\nBut trust me, when I leave, I'm staying gone and going NC because while this is a big thing, it's only one of many reasons and my resentment has only been festering since she has always treated me like a wallet and atm since I started working and I'm so over it.\n\nSo coming from someone that understands and has been through it, don't forgive her she knew what she was doing and she isn't sorry so why should you forgive her", "NTA", "INFO\n\n#TELL ME you pressed charges.", "Say you'll pick her up then don't, ask her what it feels like being let down.

Keep firm to your boundaries and don't give a lift, but keep it dignified and respectful and don't get drawn in to any drama.", "That is a lot kinder than many people would have been, especially since it sounds like you haven't taken steps to ensure she faces criminal prosecution.", "So honestly, I\u2019m going to say NAH on that.

Absolutely not.\n\nYou're well within your rights to refuse to do that.", "I know this is mostly about the serial identity thief mother, but what is the story with the credit card companies giving credit cards out like Halloween candy?

Some things are just unforgiveable & if this is for you, then don't \"put it aside\" for one day.  Stand your ground.  Your mother needs to understand how she wronged you & she probably is not grasping the seriousness of what she did.  Your siblings are enabling her behavior.", "NTA The act was disgraceful.

Those kinds of people do not change\u2026but even so, I think you should forgive her only because I think you deserve to not be tied down to bitterness in the form of your mom.

You have proof, by the age you were when it started that this is a clear case of identity theft. You should have been able to get that taken off your credit. Always I am surprised how this so easily happens. I mean it's not just the access to your social, but the companies that allow this to happen knowing what your birthday is. You can't get utilities, credit cards, etc without being 18 and even if mom lies to make you older running the social would prove it was not a correct birthdate.", "then why are you saying that what OP's mother did is beyond the pale but your friends...well, they were force by circumstance?
