So she not only stole your identity, but she didn't actually pay for the things she's ordered? \n\nI'm spiteful so I'd say \"when she's paid the bill she ran up in my name.\" But good on you for sticking to boundaries.", "NTA. Forgiveness is never owed. It's as simple as that. It's between you and your mother. Your siblings have no say in it, I wouldn't blame them if they were trying to help mend burnt bridges, but putting pressure on you?...\n\nForgiveness should at the very least start with her coming forward to you apologizing for what she's done.", "NTA:  I've forgiven a family member for stealing from me.\n\nThere was a lot of apologizing and taking responsibility though.  It was a one off situation that I know won't happen again.\n\nDoesn't sound like you got any of that.  \n\nPs.  If family members push you to forgive her ask them to reimburse you.", "NTA. That is a massive beach of trust,  and very harmful to you and your credit.  One of your siblings can make some kind of arrangement to pick her up.", "NTA. Who in your family is going to miss her at the funeral? She's probably trying to figure out how to steal the dearly departed's identity right now.", "NTA, that is not only criminal, but also wildly selfish to mess with your credit.", "Info:  why can\u2019t they get her an Uber?", "NTA. Your siblings don't want to deal with their mom and are only asking you to fold so that you can do what they want.", "NTA. Your mother is a criminal and she is lucky you didn\u2019t go to the police. Your siblings can spring for a taxi or Uber for her to get to the funeral.", "NTA. Your mom not only violated your trust by stealing your identity, but she also has a history of doing this to others. Forgiveness is a personal choice, and it's understandable that you're still hurt and angry about her actions. Attending the funeral doesn't mean you have to forgive or forget what she did. Your siblings should respect your feelings and not pressure you into a situation you're not comfortable with, especially given your mom's track record. Your decision to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries is valid.", "NTA, and what your mother did is just shocking. Your own mother stole money from you and then lied about it.\n\nI would never forgive that, but this is your story and yours to conclude as you wish. If you want to drive her to the funeral, do so. If you don't, you won't\n\nNo one else has a right to offer an opinion, and if someone does, get VERY SALTY ABOUT IT so it doesn't happen again.", "It took my sister years to clean her credit after my mom opened a cable and phone bill in her name when she was 10! SMH let her take the bus NTA!", "YTA for not reporting her to the police.\n\nBecause she will do this again unless something happens to her that makes her regret her decision.  \n\nIf you have siblings they should check their credit reports as well.", "NTA. That's beyond selfish, or a thing to just be forgiven for a day. That's abhorrent behaviour. I'm so sorry that happened to you.", "NTA, although I do agree that you should, for the funeral at least, put it aside, and simply assist your siblings in this (and it is purely your siblings).\n\nYou don't have to say a word to her, just let her step in your car and ignore her further, and at the funeral stay away from her. The time which you depart from the funeral is your decision, she has no say in it and can only follow, and after that everything goes back to how it was.", "NTA Frankly, it's been less than a year. What she did was a felony. So no you don't owe her anything.  However I would at least forgive  her, personally/ not the debt financially,  but this doesn't mean you have to rebuild the bridge she immolated, sacrificing your trust, for her narcissistic spending spree. \n\nI don't know how you refrained from involving law enforcement. Maybe lay it out to your siblings that people don't change, she did this to them too. How hard was it for them to get credit. How much time and effort and money it can, and maybe will cost you. Tell them to put up or shut up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
