Forgiveness is never owed. It's as simple as that. It's between you and your mother.

Forgiveness is a personal choice, and it's understandable that you're still hurt and angry about her actions. Attending the funeral doesn't mean you have to forgive or forget what she did.

Your decision to prioritize your own well-being and boundaries is valid.", "NTA, and what your mother did is just shocking.

I'm so sorry that happened to you.", "NTA, although I do agree that you should, for the funeral at least, put it aside, and simply assist your siblings in this (and it is purely your siblings).\n\nYou don't have to say a word to her, just let her step in your car and ignore her further, and at the funeral stay away from her. The time which you depart from the funeral is your decision, she has no say in it and can only follow, and after that everything goes back to how it was.", "NTA Frankly, it's been less than a year. What she did was a felony. So no you don't owe her anything.  However I would at least forgive  her, personally/ not the debt financially,  but this doesn't mean you have to rebuild the bridge she immolated, sacrificing your trust, for her narcissistic spending spree. \n\nI don't know how you refrained from involving law enforcement. Maybe lay it out to your siblings that people don't change, she did this to them too. How hard was it for them to get credit. How much time and effort and money it can, and maybe will cost you.
