He fraudulently took out a loan in his mother's name.  He's selfish and neglecting his daughter's needs to meet his own personal wants.  He's an asshole AND a criminal. \n\nYou might consider a legal separation which should protect you from future financial issues he is bound to cause, and warn his mother to lock down her credit. She should be made aware of what he did and might do in the future.\n\nAlso, lock the credit of yourself and your children too.

And it's a crime... To take out a loan in someone else's name when they don't know about it.... and if he did this because she's disabled and in his care... Elder abuse. \n\nSo no, you're not wrong to make sure he pays off the loan (the fraudulent identity theft based loan) and no you're not wrong to prevent him from accessing your half of the money as it is split. And you need to set up your mother in law with a credit monitoring system. You can do this through any of the major credit bureaus and 'freeze' your name and social security numbr for six months to a year to prevent someone opening a new account anywhere without a bunch of extra steps (like presenting an ID in person).\n\nAlso time to do the same for your kids. Because the next person people are most likely to start account names under is their children and/a spouse. And there will be a next time. You husband has a problem. A serious one.", "NTA You're not overreacting, you're *underreacting*.\n\nHe's financially irresponsible to an extreme. He fraudulently obtained a loan under his mother's name without her knowledge. The identity theft alone is unforgivable, but then add in the fact that she's been very generous to him and has memory issues? This is literal elder abuse, and I'm sure this isn't the first time he pulled he took advantage of her, it's probably just the first time he was caught. Your husband also doesn't take care of his kids properly, and he puts his wants above his children's actual needs.\n\n...And when you call him out on his literal crime, he gaslights you and acts like you're what, jealous? Mad at him for treating himself?\n\nIt's time to get legal advice on how to separate from him. Not just because there's nothing in this marriage worth saving, but because your main focus right now needs to be protecting both yourself and your children. And you need to take the necessary steps to ensure there is no way whatsoever he can access money or get credit cards or take out loans under your name, your MIL's (talk to whoever is in charge of her accounts or get legal help with this) or *any* of his children. Because I can guarantee you that is absolutely what is going to happen next. ...*If* it hasn't already happened.\n\nSince we know your husband clearly has no issue with identity theft, I suggest checking everyone's credit history just to be safe. Do some serious digging. There's no way he hasn't done other stuff you're not aware of yet.", "NTA but your solution may not be possible and it doesn\u2019t even touch issues much bigger than a laptop.

If anything, you are not being dramatic enough about this!! Taking out a loan in someone else's name is not only highly illegal, but also this might be elder abuse if he's taking advantage of his mother with dementia. This is beyond a Reddit advice situation. You need a real life lawyer, pronto. And take steps to ensure your own identity is protected. Check all your credit reports and freeze your own credit, right now. Freeze your kids' credit if you can, too.", "...there is no world where an adult should be buying themselves a gaming laptop when their child needs clothes. Period. I'm also vaguely confused why 'kid stuff' money isn't budgeted into bills/why all the 'leftover' money is split between the adults when there are also kid and general household expenses. Aka, this financial split doesn't sound like it makes sense. Why is there just bill money and personal money and no household funding? \n\nAnyway. NTA for the actual question, at least.", "NTA and that probably is illegal what he did to his mother.", "NTA but you need to protect yourself, the children, and family members from his criminal behavior.", "NTA, and not dramatic.

You're never an asshole for returning money that was stolen from a loved one. That MIL has dementia makes her son's theft especially vile.", "NTA.
