When the stakes are so high, your uncle and his family should be immediately given the option to stay elsewhere, or respect the requirements of a healthy home.  And if they purposely violate it again, kick them out.   \n\n\nAllergies are no joke.", "NTA I cannot stress enough that bringing food into a home that you know someone is allergic to is the poorest manners I can imagine.  There is no excuse for this, it is dangerous and hugely selfish. Tell them to respect your wife's SERIOUS MEDICAL condition or get a hotel.", "NTA, but you need to go a bit further than this. Be blunt with them. What\u2019s rude is to bring home something that will make one of your hosts ill, on purpose. If they cannot accept your hospitality and respect your home because the idea of not eating peaches for a few days is that important to them, then that\u2019s unfortunate and they aren\u2019t going to be able to stay at your house. Tell them to take an hour to think about it and decide if they are going to apologise, admit bringing the peaches into your home was not acceptable, and drop the attitude about it; or if they would prefer to go and find a hotel.\n\nThose are their options, and you should enforce them as calmly as you are able. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise that bringing peaches into the house was a dealbreaker for you, or we wouldn\u2019t have offered to host. It\u2019s been lovely seeing you up until this; we hope you enjoy the rest of your trip, and let me know if you need me to help you find transport to the hotel.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThey are testing your boundaries. Good on you for backing up your wife, and being direct!", "People who are saying \u201cit could still be done safely\u201d don\u2019t know about severe allergies.  I have a friend that had a severe peanut allergy.  If someone had peanut butter for breakfast and then talked to her two hours later, it could trigger a severe reaction.  \n\nNTA for keeping your wife safe", "Obviously NTA. The only ones being rude are your guests. The nerves to willingly bring allergens into the house of your host\u2026", "You\u2019re NTA as they just brought peaches over without even notifying you.\n\nMAYBE tossing peaches outside was a dick move, but I wouldn\u2019t blame you.", "If it\u2019s an actual allergy then that tops everything, so NTA. Your wife has every right to be comfortable in her own home", "NTA.\nYour Aunt should\u2019ve asked to put \u2018em in there.", "NTA, you were protecting your wife. You absolutely can dictate what someone eats in your house. You don't go to a Muslim family's house and bring your own pork. You don't go to the house of someone with a nut allergy and bring your own peanuts.\n\nHowever, I think putting the peaches temporarily somewhere they wouldn't come in contact with your wife and then asking your family to take them away would have avoided conflict. Your wife isn't deathly allergic, and while she shouldn't have to deal with allergies in her own home, I think throwing them away was always going to upset your guests. If they had still refused to take them away, then throwing them away would have been your only option.\n\nThat being said, it's your house, and they were in your fridge. People can't put something in your fridge without telling you and being upset when it disappears.", "NTA - Your house your rules", "Your uncle is a dick looool. No. Your house, your rules. Sometimes, I may feel someone's house rules are stupid, but I will *still* falter on its your house, your rules. On top of that, your wife is allergic to the shit they brought in. NTA on multiple fronts.", "NTA - but they certainly are. I think they can restrict their fruit consumption temporarily so your wife doesn't suffer from allergic reactions in her own home. Here's a novel idea, maybe they can eat their peaches outside. How are some people so self absorbed and selfish?", "NTA - but maybe you should\u2019ve told them before you threw it out so they knew instead of just finding out. It\u2019s so entitled how they expect respect but are willing to put someone in danger for a little bit of fruit. Frankly if they decide to do something like that again, you should recommend a nice hotel with no food restrictions :)", "NTA. If someone has a severe allergy to something it should not be anywhere near them. It is not some brat demanding from you and your relatives should be more understanding. \nAllergic reactions can be death serious and it is not some kind of a childish behaviour to not allow fruit that may harm your wife.", "NTA\n\nTurn that host bit around on them. They are impolite guests. When you are a guest in a persons home you do not perform actions that will harm your host. Next time make the rules about fruit/allergies clear before they arrive and make it clear if they can't follow rules a hotel is the other option. \n\nHave you given then a list of fruits that your wife does not react to?", "NTA, good manners are not good excuse to put your wife in a hospital. Where are their good manners to think of their hosts wellbeing? (However, throwing away the fruit might have been overreaction - you could have told them to eat them on the spot while your wife is away or to eat them outside of the house).", "NTA. What you told them about allergies is serious, and they can't just violate rules you set in the home for your guests to follow.\n\nI take you at your word that this was something of an emergency situation. Emergency situations trump manners.", "NTA\nThey should stay elsewhere", "NTA.\n\nI personally hate fruits. All of them. It's like a phobia. I won't touch them and I even hate the smell of them. However I am not allergic to them (or at least I don't know about it since I have never tasted one). I live with my boyfriend who loves fruits. He understands my issues and buys only fruits that doesn't smell, keep them away from my sight, washes those kitchen accessories that were in contact with fruits and if he is starving for a fruit that would trigger me he just buys it before work and eat it in lunch break. \n\nYou told them beforehand to not bring those things into your home yet they did. This is what I call poor manner. \nI wouldn't just throw the fruits away but also kick them out. They were disrespectful, never tried to apologise and brought things into your home that were dangerous for your wife.", "NTA - let them get Airbnb.", "NYA. Your house, your rules.", "Nta. They need to know you keep your house allergen free for your wife.", "NTA. They can book a hotel room if they don't like your rules.", "NTA. Allergies are serious and should be taken seriously.\n\nThey are GUESTS for crying out loud! Shouldn't guests respect their hosts?", "Info:\n\nDid you tell them about the severity of the allergy as well? \n\nIf you did then n t a, but they very much are for bringing them \n\nIf you didn\u2019t then n a h, it\u2019s not that common to get a reaction just from touch so they probably didn\u2019t know", "NTA - I don\u2019t think it was the right thing to throw them off though, maybe give them away to neighbours or something. But that\u2019s totally normal to protect your wife from getting allergy symptoms", "NTA\n\nThat was a deliberate power play. There are plenty of other fruits they could have chosen. \n\nTell your aunt that good manners don\u2019t involve imperiling your host.", "Every day I learn about a new allergy.  \nIs there anything anywhere that someone isn't allergic too?  \nHumans are weird.", "[deleted]", "ESH\n\nYour fam shouldn\u2019t of brought the fruit into the common areas where your gf will be exposed to allergens- possible cross contact in the fridge. That said I hope you made it clear with them to begin with. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t of just thrown the fruit out. You could of put them aside and spoke to your family nicely and remind them about the allergy, and ask them to eat the fruit outside of the house or whatever. Peaches don\u2019t even need to be stored in the fridge so could easily consume them elsewhere.\n\nSide note, I think with anaphylaxis allergies that people can also manage them a bit better and not just have a blanket ban. Otherwise how would you ever eat out? Some ways of doing that is by segregation, we do this in manufacturing all the time.", "ESH:\n\nYou shouldn't have thrown out their fruit they bought with their own money. You could have put it in a safe spot outside of the house and given them the option to eat it outside or away from your home.\n\nThey reacted terribly by demanding to eat fruit in someone's house where they were a guest and where there's a life threatening allergy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
