There is no excuse for this, it is dangerous and hugely selfish. Tell them to respect your wife's SERIOUS MEDICAL condition or get a hotel.", "NTA, but you need to go a bit further than this. Be blunt with them. What\u2019s rude is to bring home something that will make one of your hosts ill, on purpose. If they cannot accept your hospitality and respect your home because the idea of not eating peaches for a few days is that important to them, then that\u2019s unfortunate and they aren\u2019t going to be able to stay at your house. Tell them to take an hour to think about it and decide if they are going to apologise, admit bringing the peaches into your home was not acceptable, and drop the attitude about it; or if they would prefer to go and find a hotel.\n\nThose are their options, and you should enforce them as calmly as you are able. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise that bringing peaches into the house was a dealbreaker for you, or we wouldn\u2019t have offered to host. It\u2019s been lovely seeing you up until this; we hope you enjoy the rest of your trip, and let me know if you need me to help you find transport to the hotel.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThey are testing your boundaries. Good on you for backing up your wife, and being direct!", "People who are saying \u201cit could still be done safely\u201d don\u2019t know about severe allergies.

You absolutely can dictate what someone eats in your house. You don't go to a Muslim family's house and bring your own pork.

Your wife isn't deathly allergic, and while she shouldn't have to deal with allergies in her own home, I think throwing them away was always going to upset your guests.

It\u2019s so entitled how they expect respect but are willing to put someone in danger for a little bit of fruit. Frankly if they decide to do something like that again, you should recommend a nice hotel with no food restrictions :)", "NTA. If someone has a severe allergy to something it should not be anywhere near them. It is not some brat demanding from you and your relatives should be more understanding. \nAllergic reactions can be death serious and it is not some kind of a childish behaviour to not allow fruit that may harm your wife.", "NTA\n\nTurn that host bit around on them.

We don\u2019t fuck with life threatening allergies, ever. It is beyond rude (aka negligent) for your uncle and aunt to not get this. Also, there is a lot of old school thinking around allergies, and not being serious, not understanding how even touching food protein residue or air born vapors can cause anaphalaxis, there is also an misunderstanding of what anaphalaxis is (not just breathing people!) so there is an opportunity to sit them down and educate them. If they can\u2019t handle it, that is why we have hotels and air bnb. Best of luck!", "Some people don't believe in allergies. It seems to be their case.\n\nNTA.

Just like how people with bee allergies can be bee keepers. \n\n\nSo many people get freaked out, and fair enough because they don\u2019t understand the science, and just do a total ban when infact there are various ways to manage depending on several factors; how it\u2019s transmitted (Ingested/airborne), what\u2019s the effects, how severe is the allergy, etc. These are all valid questions and can significantly improve one\u2019s life if understood. \n\nSome allergens mild exposure is actually good to provide low levels of tolerance, but depends.", "As one who has anaphylaxis when I eat peanuts or tree nuts, it CAN be done safely, but it requires a concerted effort by all parties.

Don\u2019t understand your comment here but whatever. \nAnd when I say \u201cmade it clear with them\u201d is that when he told them did he explain exactly? Did he tell everyone. I know for me coming from an ethnic family I have to really explain things in detail a few times so my fam understand, it\u2019s not always malicious but just ignorance form their end and that\u2019s ok.\n\nFirstly he did not say she is anaphylactic. \nSecondly peaches from my understanding are some sort of pollen allergy which I think it\u2019s mostly harmful when ingested. So breathing it in I\u2019m guessing is relatively low risk because it\u2019s a peach? These are all questions that could be asked. \nThe main problem would be cross contamination. \nAll I\u2019m saying is if you learn more about things and understand the risks and how to mitigate them, you can actually manage rather then ban.. it\u2019s actually way easier to do it at home than a commercial facility.\nAlso when I mean manufacturing I mean food manufacturing, you know, so that when food is made on a large scale you don\u2019t kill someone who buys it on shelf.
