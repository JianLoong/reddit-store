When the stakes are so high, your uncle and his family should be immediately given the option to stay elsewhere, or respect the requirements of a healthy home.  And if they purposely violate it again, kick them out.   \n\n\nAllergies are no joke.", "NTA I cannot stress enough that bringing food into a home that you know someone is allergic to is the poorest manners I can imagine.  There is no excuse for this, it is dangerous and hugely selfish. Tell them to respect your wife's SERIOUS MEDICAL condition or get a hotel.", "NTA, but you need to go a bit further than this. Be blunt with them. What\u2019s rude is to bring home something that will make one of your hosts ill, on purpose. If they cannot accept your hospitality and respect your home because the idea of not eating peaches for a few days is that important to them, then that\u2019s unfortunate and they aren\u2019t going to be able to stay at your house. Tell them to take an hour to think about it and decide if they are going to apologise, admit bringing the peaches into your home was not acceptable, and drop the attitude about it; or if they would prefer to go and find a hotel.\n\nThose are their options, and you should enforce them as calmly as you are able. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise that bringing peaches into the house was a dealbreaker for you, or we wouldn\u2019t have offered to host. It\u2019s been lovely seeing you up until this; we hope you enjoy the rest of your trip, and let me know if you need me to help you find transport to the hotel.\u201d", "NTA\n\nThey are testing your boundaries. Good on you for backing up your wife, and being direct!", "People who are saying \u201cit could still be done safely\u201d don\u2019t know about severe allergies.

You absolutely can dictate what someone eats in your house. You don't go to a Muslim family's house and bring your own pork. You don't go to the house of someone with a nut allergy and bring your own peanuts.\n\nHowever, I think putting the peaches temporarily somewhere they wouldn't come in contact with your wife and then asking your family to take them away would have avoided conflict. Your wife isn't deathly allergic, and while she shouldn't have to deal with allergies in her own home, I think throwing them away was always going to upset your guests.

It\u2019s so entitled how they expect respect but are willing to put someone in danger for a little bit of fruit. Frankly if they decide to do something like that again, you should recommend a nice hotel with no food restrictions :)", "NTA. If someone has a severe allergy to something it should not be anywhere near them. It is not some brat demanding from you and your relatives should be more understanding. \nAllergic reactions can be death serious and it is not some kind of a childish behaviour to not allow fruit that may harm your wife.", "NTA\n\nTurn that host bit around on them.

Peaches don\u2019t even need to be stored in the fridge so could easily consume them elsewhere.\n\nSide note, I think with allergies that people can also manage them a bit better and not just have a blanket ban. Otherwise how would you ever eat out? Some ways of doing that is by segregation, we do this in manufacturing all the time.", "ESH:\n\nYou shouldn't have thrown out their fruit they bought with their own money.
