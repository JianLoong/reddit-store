They asked me to meet them at a cafe and I decided to go, just to hear what they have to say. It's been 20 days since I last saw my dad. They asked if I would consider helping babysit the kid after he is born. They are thinking of having me over for three hours each day when the baby is born, so that they can have their time outside by themselves.\n\nWhen I asked my dad's wife if she would still try to control what I read, she said yes, and that she doesn't want me bringing certain books to their home. I told them that I won't do it then since they expect me to just sit there doing nothing for 3 hours except watching the kid. Won't even allow me to use TV since she doesn't want anyone else touching their remote.\n\nMy grandparents said I should be a bit willing to consider the idea since the kid's my half-sibling.\n\nUPDATE : I told it to him straight.

Nope, I\u2019d be out of there. \n\nAs for your grandparents saying you should babysit because it\u2019s your half sibling, that\u2019s a hard no.
