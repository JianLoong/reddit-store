They asked me to meet them at a cafe and I decided to go, just to hear what they have to say. It's been 20 days since I last saw my dad. They asked if I would consider helping babysit the kid after he is born. They are thinking of having me over for three hours each day when the baby is born, so that they can have their time outside by themselves.\n\nWhen I asked my dad's wife if she would still try to control what I read, she said yes, and that she doesn't want me bringing certain books to their home. I told them that I won't do it then since they expect me to just sit there doing nothing for 3 hours except watching the kid.

Nope, I\u2019d be out of there. \n\nAs for your grandparents saying you should babysit because it\u2019s your half sibling, that\u2019s a hard no.

I don't know if they ever really knew, but, I still read them. I just hid it from them. Out of sight, out of mind type thing. \n\nIf your Step Mom has an issue with LGBT, then you and she need to discuss it, and YOUR sexuality. They need to understand that this is part of who you are. If they have a problem with THAT then you have your answer. But if they don't want Romance Novels in general in their house, you have to respect THEIR rules. It is THEIR house. \n\nBTW...I wouldn't babysit my younger half-sibling unless there was pay. Not for 3 hours a day so they can \"go outside\". They can do that while the baby is asleep.
