I typically charge $40/night and recently took up a housesitting gig for my dearest coworker while she (50+F) and her husband travelled abroad in the UK. She advertised the job as though I would be staying in a nice house in a small town with her two dogs, who could remain in the yard for a majority of the day so I could go out and about and was not trapped in the house.\n\nI was not able to see the house or meet the dogs up until the day before my gig would start. Upon my arrival, I was informed that instead of staying in her home, I would be staying in her deceased fathers trailer house that had not been lived in for MONTHS and is quite literally something that could be featured on the show \u201cHoarders: Buried Alive\u201d. It was tucked away on the edge of town, right outside the woods, there was junk and trash everywhere, it reeked like body odor and moth balls, everything had about half an inch of dust on it, there were cobwebs and spiders in every corner. However, my coworker assured me she was working on cleaning it up for me, stocking the fridge for me, and making it live-able. \n\nWhen I arrived the next evening to begin my gig, I found the trailer house to be in the exact same condition I had seen it in the day before, aside from the mixed scent of body odor and Febreze. Being an asthmatic and having terrible allergies when it comes to dust, I decided to try to open some windows to air it out, however, they were all sealed shut. I looked for a fan or an AC unit, but could locate none of the above in the home. After feeding the dogs and giving them both some love, I decided to turn in for the night. \n\nI was kept awake all night by the mice running around in the walls, in the closet, under my bed. I fell asleep for maybe 30 minutes before I woke up wheezing. I found mouse poop in my shoe the next morning. \n\nI am only on Night 1. She left me a family members contact in case of emergency. I cannot tough it out. My gut is telling me I need to get out of here. I am tempted to call when the sun rises and let the family member know that this is not working out for me and that I am uncomfortable staying here. So, users of Reddit, if I end up doing that, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692871153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zxhvo/aita_for_bailing_on_a_housesitting_job_that_was/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If a customer cancels with more then two weeks notice they get the full deposit back. Less then two weeks notice they get half the deposit back. Less then 48 hours notice no refund and less then 24 hours they have to pay the full balance.\n\nUnfortunately over the years I\u2019ve encountered multiple customers who\u2019ll try and change the conditions or underpay so it\u2019s best to protect yourself as much as possible.", "Unfortunately I do not have access to the house.

Plants watered, mail collected, that kind of thing?\n\nI can't help thinking they just needed someone to look after their dogs but didn't want to pay for kennels, and didn't want to trust you with their nice home?

Only reason I ask is if it is a thing with a formal contract she could be in breach of contract. You were paid to house sit, and if it is a contract that unusually involves living conditions. Not provided then she can\u2019t pursue or ask for it back. \n\nWorking with her will be awkward whatever you do, but if she is in breach of contract then let your shared boss know, as it may become a whole thing if you choose to pursue that.

Probably more actionable than the human living conditions.", "NTA\n\nShe changed the conditions, made them worse and you still agreed to do it. Risking health for 40$ doesn't seem worth it.", "NTA. And I just want to say - your coworker knows how bad it is. She knows. She might try to guilt you about it, because it's inconvenient for her to be called out in any way, and also to have to go with another plan for pet sitting.

Just say no and leave ffs", "NTA I\u2019d tell you to tough it out, but with nice running around, that changes everything. You can get really sick from airborne viruses from it.", "NTA. Bail, document the hazards and anything misleading coworker said in writing, and let coworker and the emergency contact sort it out.

Because you like the co-worker, and if you want to stay friends-\n\nI would call the emergency contact and say that you cannot do it because of asthma and allergies. It is a health issue.

The owner didn\u2019t give you permission to go into/stay at the house, and since she\u2019s so dishonest and untrustworthy, she might accuse you of causing damage and/or stealing things. \n\nIf my daughter were in your position, I\u2019d tell her to document the conditions in the trailer and call the non emergency line of the local authorities. If the dogs\u2019 owners have given written permission for the emergency contact to take the dogs, then I\u2019d tell my daughter to contact them first (via text so it\u2019s all in writing) to immediately come and get the poor dogs. If the emergency contact didn\u2019t immediately reply, then I\u2019d tell my daughter to call the authority\u2019s non emergency number so they can take the dogs to a safe place. \n\nYour physical health is in jeopardy, and the dogs\u2019 health is in jeopardy. Your co-worker is dishonest and cannot be trusted. Take video and photos of the trailer, both inside and outside. Try to get the sound of the mice on video. When/If the authorities arrive, let them do their job and possibly gain entrance to the trailer. Ask the authorities what you legally should do (for example, give the dogs to the emergency contact if there\u2019s no written permission from the dogs\u2019 owner). \n\nPlease do not spend one more night in that unsafe environment.
