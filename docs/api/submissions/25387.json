I typically charge $40/night and recently took up a housesitting gig for my dearest coworker while she (50+F) and her husband travelled abroad in the UK. She advertised the job as though I would be staying in a nice house in a small town with her two dogs, who could remain in the yard for a majority of the day so I could go out and about and was not trapped in the house.\n\nI was not able to see the house or meet the dogs up until the day before my gig would start. Upon my arrival, I was informed that instead of staying in her home, I would be staying in her deceased fathers trailer house that had not been lived in for MONTHS and is quite literally something that could be featured on the show \u201cHoarders: Buried Alive\u201d. It was tucked away on the edge of town, right outside the woods, there was junk and trash everywhere, it reeked like body odor and moth balls, everything had about half an inch of dust on it, there were cobwebs and spiders in every corner. However, my coworker assured me she was working on cleaning it up for me, stocking the fridge for me, and making it live-able. \n\nWhen I arrived the next evening to begin my gig, I found the trailer house to be in the exact same condition I had seen it in the day before, aside from the mixed scent of body odor and Febreze. Being an asthmatic and having terrible allergies when it comes to dust, I decided to try to open some windows to air it out, however, they were all sealed shut. I looked for a fan or an AC unit, but could locate none of the above in the home. After feeding the dogs and giving them both some love, I decided to turn in for the night. \n\nI was kept awake all night by the mice running around in the walls, in the closet, under my bed. I fell asleep for maybe 30 minutes before I woke up wheezing. I found mouse poop in my shoe the next morning. \n\nI am only on Night 1. She left me a family members contact in case of emergency. I cannot tough it out. My gut is telling me I need to get out of here. I am tempted to call when the sun rises and let the family member know that this is not working out for me and that I am uncomfortable staying here. So, users of Reddit, if I end up doing that, AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for the feedback and advice!! I was able to resolve something with the emergency contact and I will NOT being staying there any longer.

I wouldn't housesit in someone else's house, for a variety of reasons. The condition of the house would be one concern. Their \"rules\" would be another. That's why I would only take care of the dogs in MY home, because I know the condition of my house and that it's dog safe and safe for me.", "She's 19 they knew she'd be too meek to deny it and lied to her. No way she's TA for still believing in people", "Did she give you a reason for not allowing you to stay in the house?", "I\u2019m on rover and because I\u2019m 19 I don\u2019t have a dog safe home so a lot of my income comes from house sitting. You do a tour of where you\u2019ll be staying and go through expectations. And if there\u2019s an issue you contact the owner, it\u2019s not really an option to just not house-sit tbh especially if you\u2019re younger and have say an apartment that doesn\u2019t allow pets", "Yes, I think if they wanted her in the house, they'd have offered that. But that's the reason I'd cite. Main house or GTFO.", "This is 100% someone taking advantage of the naviety of a 19 year old.", "I would go straight to GTFO after getting the emergency contact to the trailer. After how she was lied to and mistreated, I would not help them at all anymore. And who knows how their house looks like. Maybe it is a nightmare, too. Not to mention maybe they could make shit up about her like she stole stuff in their house if allowed into it. There is no reason to trust them at all after what they have done.", "No, don't demand that they put you in the house after they mistreated you like that. Giving you a place to sleep with tons of dust, spiders, mice and likely bedbugs and who knows what other vermin is just totally disgusting, unhealthy and a huge AH move. Also a trailer, right outside the woods, feels far less secure to sleep in than a proper house. You are a young woman alone after all. Okay, if the dogs are big, they might provide some extra protection, but if not it sounds really not save to me. \n\nThey lied to you for weeks about what they wanted from you. They just wanted a cheap dogsitter as they don't trust you and likely others with their house. I wouldn't forgive that in your shoes.\n\nCall the emergency contact, tell them they should come to the trailer, say that you won't stay in that disgusting place one minute longer and the dogs are their responsibility now and then just go home.", "This.  The expert stuff I\u2019ve read is that heat is \\[enough) heat is 100% effective.", "This is not house sitting, this is dog  sitting. If you were house sitting you would be at her house. Instead you are stuck in a trailer that\u2019s basically been abandoned for months. I highly doubt she cares about the trailer enough for you to \u201cwatch\u201d it. It would almost be better for you to take her dogs to your house and take care of them there since you are dog sitting", "NTA at all- this lady tricked you. You don\u2019t have to stay any where that makes you feel uncomfortable. I\u2019ve done plenty of dog sitting in strangers homes and I would never accept something that would cause me to feel uncomfortable. Thank goodness I\u2019ve never had an issue. I\u2019m happy to see that everything has been resolved.", "NTA. You had every right to bail immediately.", "Isn\u2019t it the other way round? If there\u2019s mice you know there\u2019s no rats? I read that in a book as a child and thought it was true until your comment lol", "Thank you, I appreciate your response :) I reached out to the emergency contact and she agreed with me, so we worked something out to tag team it so that no one has to stay and the dogs are still taken care of. Appreciate you!!", "What a *shitty* coworker \ud83d\ude12", "One possible explanation is they don\u2019t want any bed bugs or fleas from the dogs spread to their house.  I wonder if these dogs have a vet or shots etc too.", "They are the lady\u2019s dogs. They already live with her. They are temporarily staying at the crappy trailer with OOP just while their owners are out of town.", "I live in a mid-sized city and pay around $40 per night. My dog\u2019s kennel is a small room with a barn door. So he\u2019s never really caged. He\u2019s just contained to an area. He also gets lots of treats, time outside, and a massage before bed. He loves going there.", "Yep - that matches with my experience!", "NTA - but if the trailer looks like that, imagine what her house looks like.", "NTA.", "Nta id bail as soon as I saw the trailer", "Did she give you any reason for why you were stuck in this trailer rather than the house? NTA regardless but I\u2019m fascinated by the audacity of some people", "It's a coworker, not sure if there was an ad", "OP referenced an advertisement but even if it wasn\u2019t an advertisement there was some communication that was likely done electronically", "NTA, but INFO: Why didn't your coworker allow you and the dogs to stay in the house? Were they the father's dogs that now he has passed now are doomed to have to live in that horrible trailer?", "NTA.\n\nI can't believe you even tried to stay for a minute, let along a night!  100% false advertising, hell no!", "NTA", "Update?", "NTA\n\nTell the emergency contact to take the dogs.\n\nTake photos of the place so when your co-worker tries to make you look bad... show everyone the photos.  Actually just show everyone at work where you were expected to live.\n\nIf the transaction was all verbal and she tells people that you agreed to stay in the trailer... ask them would they be happy to stay there instead...\n\nActually you could just say you had an asthma attack in the trailer and can't stay there full stop... if someone says something... mention something about mice, bedbugs and fleas but you weren't going to bring that up... but seeing as they are painting you out to be the bad one you thought you'd better clear your name."]}
