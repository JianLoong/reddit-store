I typically charge $40/night and recently took up a housesitting gig for my dearest coworker while she (50+F) and her husband travelled abroad in the UK. She advertised the job as though I would be staying in a nice house in a small town with her two dogs, who could remain in the yard for a majority of the day so I could go out and about and was not trapped in the house.\n\nI was not able to see the house or meet the dogs up until the day before my gig would start. Upon my arrival, I was informed that instead of staying in her home, I would be staying in her deceased fathers trailer house that had not been lived in for MONTHS and is quite literally something that could be featured on the show \u201cHoarders: Buried Alive\u201d. It was tucked away on the edge of town, right outside the woods, there was junk and trash everywhere, it reeked like body odor and moth balls, everything had about half an inch of dust on it, there were cobwebs and spiders in every corner. However, my coworker assured me she was working on cleaning it up for me, stocking the fridge for me, and making it live-able. \n\nWhen I arrived the next evening to begin my gig, I found the trailer house to be in the exact same condition I had seen it in the day before, aside from the mixed scent of body odor and Febreze. Being an asthmatic and having terrible allergies when it comes to dust, I decided to try to open some windows to air it out, however, they were all sealed shut. I looked for a fan or an AC unit, but could locate none of the above in the home. After feeding the dogs and giving them both some love, I decided to turn in for the night. \n\nI was kept awake all night by the mice running around in the walls, in the closet, under my bed. I fell asleep for maybe 30 minutes before I woke up wheezing. I found mouse poop in my shoe the next morning. \n\nI am only on Night 2. She left me a family members contact in case of emergency. I cannot tough it out. My gut is telling me I need to get out of here. I am tempted to call when the sun rises and let the family member know that this is not working out for me and that I am uncomfortable staying here. So, users of Reddit, if I end up doing that, AITA?", "created_utc": 1692871153, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zxhvo/aita_for_bailing_on_a_housesitting_job_that_was/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they\u2019re at the house, or the house is at least accessible, I might say you\u2019re willing to continue the gig only if you can stay there.\n\nEither way though, NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to stay in a hazardous situation, and this is. You don\u2019t have to sacrifice yourself for a gig, especially one you were tricked into. It would have been better to just say no as soon as your coworker made the change and not start the gig in the first place once she changed it, but also you\u2019re 19 and it can be hard to stand up for yourself in a situation like that.\n\nMake sure you take lots of pictures and videos to document the condition of the trailer in case your coworker tries to retaliate in any way.", "NTA use the emergency contact and tell them either you stay in the house or you are done.", "NTA.  Bail.   Call your coworker and quit.  Check in on the dogs a couple times a day if you are able.  Or she can arrange a kennel from the uk. \n\nDon\u2019t call your references unless she offers hazard pay like 2-3 x the rate.  \n\nYour coworker is taking advantage of you. In the future maybe it\u2019s actually better to house sit for people you don\u2019t know as well.", "NTA. Get out of there. Your coworker is the asshole.", "Leave at sunrise. And bill her for the entire gig. Totally unacceptable", "Definitely NTA. A family member can handle this situation and maybe they\u2019ll be allowed to stay in actual house. You have no obligation to risk your health and safety when you were obviously lied to. Get outta there.", "As soon as you saw the place you should have bailed!!!!!!!!", "NTA, a rodent infestation to the degree you described is considered a biohazard. She probably doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s been overrun at this point. And where there\u2019s mice, the rats will show up shortly. \n\nCall the ER numbers, explain the issue with the property, and see if there is some kind arrangement you can make for the dogs.", "I\u2019m going to give you some advise. Next time don\u2019t even step into the place if it\u2019s not as advertised, that\u2019s when you get into abandonment and other issues. Know your worth and safety risks and when to say no. Grow a backbone.", "You should never accept before seeing the place in final stage before you can be there.", "I can't believe you actually stayed!\n\nNTA\n\nAnd it's more than uncomfortable, you need to use the word 'unsafe' when calling the emergency contact. It's a biohazard and you can get very sick for being exposed to mice urine etc.", "NTA.  Your friend was less than truthful about where you would be staying and its condition. She even misled you with the promise that the place would be cleaned up before you went there.  You should have canceled the very first time that you saw the place.", "NTA your health is too important. It is mind blowing to me that they would have you in hazardous conditions instead of just staying in the house.", "NTA. These are plainly unsanitary living conditions. I wonder if the house owner has liability insurance for any health issues that ensue? I'd contact the emergency contact at first light and just say you cannot stay here because it is affecting your health.  Give distinct choices - you stay in the main house with the dogs or you hand over care of the dogs to them. I hope you are preparing a checklist and T&Cs for the next time you house sit, including viewing properties/residential arrangements before accepting the job.", "NTA. Take pictures of the place she expected you to stay in, then get the emergency contact person in place and leave. If she kicks up a fuss later, ask if she\u2019d like you to share the pictures of what she thought was suitable accommodation with anyone she has the nerve to badmouth you to. Or all mutual acquaintances, depending on how nuclear you want to go.", "Do it. Hiring you to live there is abusive. She had to have known the place was uninhabitable. Forty clams a day ain't worth *that*.

Why wouldn\u2019t you just stay at your house and visit the house during the day?

Do not spend another night there, this is a risk to your health.\n\nPlease keep taking care of the doggos (or make sure they are put up with someone who can care for them, AT THE OWNER'S EXPENSE), notify the owner that you are immediately out of there due to unsanitary conditions, and demand payment for the nights you spent there, but DO NOT STAY no matter what.", "Mice can be a big health hazard.

Also if you\u2019re not already doing so I\u2019d get customers to sign a contract that has clauses relating to the house being in a liveable condition etc. I\u2019d also suggest taking a deposit and having a cancellation policy in your contract. \n\nFor example I require a 50% deposit to hold dates for a booking. If a customer cancels with more then two weeks notice they get the full deposit back. Less then two weeks notice they get half the deposit back. Less then 48 hours notice no refund and less then 24 hours they have to pay the full balance.\n\nUnfortunately over the years I\u2019ve encountered multiple customers who\u2019ll try and change the conditions or underpay so it\u2019s best to protect yourself as much as possible.", "Unfortunately I do not have access to the house.

THAT would be an asshole move, but I don\u2019t want to leave my coworker or their family member hanging.", "In that case, all you can do is make sure the dogs are handed off to the emergency contact and get out of there. Your coworker is definitely an AH for pulling a bait and switch and expecting you to live in unsanitary and hazardous conditions.", "I think it was very nasty of the coworker to think it was ok to stick you in those conditions and not in her home which is presumably lived in and thus up to living standards. It says a lot about how she views you or others who work for her in general and it is not kind. Bail without regret my friend because she never had good intentions", "Tell the emergency contact that you're leaving if they can't get you into the house.
