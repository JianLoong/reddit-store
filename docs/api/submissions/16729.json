Hopefully, your mother and half sister will one day recognize him for who he is.", "NTA at all. I can\u2019t imagine anyone would want a person like that in your life. Cut him off! Just be prepared to have to cut off your mom and half sister since it seems like they\u2019ll take his side", "NTA, your \"father\" is an abusive misogynist asshole. A parent's job is to build their kids up, not tear them down. Your mother must have some major self-esteem issues, to tolerate mistreatment of herself & her kids.\n\nUnfortunately, some women still get told that it's a normal part of marriage. It isn't - it's emotional abuse.Putting a roof over a kid's head is basically the bare minimum of what a parent is supposed to do. It doesn't oblige anyone to tolerate abuse.\n\nYou might want to have a look at r/raisedbynarcissists.", "Nasty business all around. I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this. He is abusive, probably an alcoholic, and who knows what else he\u2019s doing. Your mother is silly to keep taking him back. You\u2019re not obligated to continue being there for him to abuse verbally, and emotionally. Is it  some sort of sick entertainment for him? Obviously, he gets some kind of kick out of it. Your mother and sister suck. If that\u2019s the only kind of dad available, then why have a dad at all?\nSuch bullshit. NTA\n\nEdit: I forgot to add you\u2019re 18 and legally an adult and perfectly within your rights to decide who you want in your life and who you don\u2019t.

He has been emotionally abusive to you and your mom, and it's not okay. It's also not okay that your mom is making you feel guilty for not wanting to have a relationship with him. She should be supporting you and your decision to cut him out of your life, not making you feel bad about it. It's important for your mental health and well-being to surround yourself with people who treat you with respect and kindness, and it sounds like your dad doesn't fit that bill. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for prioritizing your own well-being.\n\nSorry for what you've been through and I wish you all the best in life.", "NTA so much. Stand your ground. You are not a GD pawn in a game.", "NTA\n\nTake it from someone else who is autistic and curvy, you can remove people like this from your life and feel happy", "NTA.  As you are 18, I hope you are able to get out of there soon.", "NTA. I would go no contact with the lot of them, this is some seriously toxic BS.", "That's impressive, snapping a phone in half. Seems you had a lot of nice things growing up. I'm not going to tell you how to live your life or what you should do. I will say many children around the world have to fight battles every day just to stay alive. Many of them don't make it to adulthood. You get out of life what you put into it. If you put negativity into it, that is what you will get out of it.", ">When my dad found out, he snapped my laptop and phone in two with his bare hands and yelled in my face.\n\nEhhhhhh. \n\n>He has currently left and is trying to get back into contact with me. I refused\n\nGood. That's the way. You don't only get one dad. I had a dad, a step dad, and a FIL. I only actually liked my FIL but the other two still existed. You'll find other people to meet your needs. NTA.", "I'm going to say nta for a very specific reason, because you and only you get to decide who you associate with. My dad was never abusive but he definitely was negligent in raising me. I couldn't put a face to name until he showed up at my mother's doorstep when I was 6 to take me back because she crossed state lines. Then when my mother got custody I didn't see him for a good while until they decided to share and I was bouncing between states on the opposite ends of the US. Needless to say we didn't have a good relationship until I was around 17. At this point I tried bonding and doing things with him and it went well until about 5 years ago when my grandfather passed. After that he moved to Florida with his new wife and it's been about two years since I've talked to him. I've seen his truck in town but would never let me know he was here, I'd talk to my brother and he'd ask why I didn't show up at the family party our dad hosted and I had to tell him I didn't know. So eventually I just deleted his number. If yours is worse than mine then I would say get a restraining order and look into assault charges since he destroyed your devices, depending on how long it's been", "NTA.\n\nAll I'm about to say are just advices, please don't take it as if I'm telling you what to do.\n\nI'd suggest you to cut your mother and sister off from your life as well as your father if they keep pressing on you like that.\nI'm not diagnosed yet, but I'm suspected of having autism, and I know how stressful it is to have someone yelling at you constantly for things you can't even change about you, and punishing you for reacting (lucky me it wasn't my parents who treated me like that).\n\nYou deserve to be happy and healthy, and your family isn't a reason for you to give up on your own sanity and possibly even your body (who knows, things might get pretty ugly if that rotten man feels safe to raise his hands against you or your mother).\n\nAgain, take it as an adivce and stay safe. You're not alone.", "NTA. He is a shitty human being and a poor excuse for a father and husband. Your mom and half sister are willing to tolerate the bullshit to maintain some jacked up idea of family, but you don\u2019t have to tolerate him if you choose not to.", "NTA- I wouldn't want someone who was abusive in my life either. I undersatnd 100% why you're no contact and I would keep it that way for your mental health.", "NTA. Your dad is an abuser, and growing up with that can effect you for the rest of your life. Whenever you have the ability, it would be a good idea to spend time talking to a therapist.", "Not only are you NTA for not wanting to interact with this abusive jerk, but your mother is also participating in his abuse of you, by not removing him from your life, and actively pushing you to interact with him. Your sister is likely too young to understand she\u2019s part of an abusive household, and is unfortunately learning to victim-shame from her parents.", "NTA and I had a similar dad and also chose no contact. Thankfully. My mom was not like yours and trying to get him back. Honestly your mother is JUST as toxic.", "I can understand where they both side with him. My mother has borderline personality disorder, she obsessed over him. She idolised him after everything and still does because of her mental illness. My half sister\u2019s dad passed, she never got to experience what it was like so I get why she says im lucky to have a dad. I just wish they both took my feelings into consideration", "I\u2019m sorry :(( \n\nI hope everything works out. But, coming from someone who\u2019s dad also passed when they were young, you don\u2019t need to feel obligated to keep your dad in your life just because someone else lost theirs", "NTA. \n\nYour father sounds horrendous, better to have no father than a father that horrid.", "NTA. But the problem here is also your mom. She is manipulative and their relationship is toxic. Go to therapy.", "I\u2019m not even reading the other comments bc no amount of \u2018context\u2019 could change my vote from NTA!! Unquestionably NTA. You are not obligated to allow abusers a place in your life. Full stop."]}
