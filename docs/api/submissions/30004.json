My friend let's call her Stacey (30f) recently got married. About 6 months before her wedding she asked me to make 75 cupcakes for her wedding. Baking is a hobby of mine and I have gotten very good at it. I agreed even though I'm not part of the wedding party and was doing this as a friend. Stacey also had 5 other people helping make the food. Well she calls me 3 weeks before the wedding and asks me to make 1 hungry pan of baked beans. At this point I'm still under the impression that it is going to be a smallish wedding so I say sure. So fast forward to 1 week before the wedding and she calls me and tells me the guest list has grew slightly. She then tells me she needs 3 huge pans of baked beans and wants me to use a specific recipe instead of my own and now needed 300 cupcakes instead of 75. As well as she doesn't want me to use box mix for the cupcakes (which I had planned to use since I'm buying all the ingredients for everything I'm making) she wants them to be homemade including the frosting. Told me I was a life saver and ended the call. Before I had a chance to say anything. So for 2 days before the wedding I was in my kitchen baking and cooking. While also taking care of my kids. So the wedding comes I take everything to the venue and helped set everything up. Fast forward to about a week after the wedding a mutual friend called me to ask about my thank you basket from Stacey. Come to find out she sent everyone a thank you basket for helping with the wedding (including the other people that helped with making the food) except me. I called her and talked with her, I figured I needed to let her know I had not gotten mine. I know that sounds entitled. I just thought since everyone else had gotten one maybe mine got lost. That's when she told me that she never sent me one cause I'm a stay at home mom so it was no big deal for me to help with stuff for the wedding but everyone else had actual jobs so it was an inconvenience for them to help but not me. I told her that it was hard for me to help as well and to except a bill in the mail from me. Which I did. I charged her for everything I had bought to make the food (I included copies of the receipts), a delivery fee, a set up fee, and charged her for my time to making everything. It totaled to right at $900 now I have a few mutual friends telling me I'm an AH for charging her.

You never asked for a fee beforehand, and you agreed to make the food without ever discussing compensation. So while she's the asshole here, not you, I hope you understand that the bill--which was a great power move on your part--will likely just be for show in the end. She'll never pay it.", "NTA - she definitely desirous be billed for all of that food.", "NTA", "NTA - I\u2019m kinda on the fence here; the consensus is already looking like NTA but it does feel a bit petty to charge AFTER hearing about the basket; correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but there was no agreement previously about payment right?  Assuming it was not expected that she\u2019d pay, it would be a bit of a rude surprise.  That said she\u2019s definitely An AH that deserved a bill from the first addition to the order and forward: she clearly under-appreciates you and the lack of a gift basket is ridiculous.  In short, this feels like tit-for-tat which is always a bit rude, even if deserved; for the record, I would have done the same in the end even though I say it\u2019s a bit rude.", "NTA  I hate people who think because someone is a SAM their time doesn't matter.

You can't just make up a bill and expect someone to pay for your time if that wasn't talked about first.\n\nThe right way to handle it would have been to say sorry, I can't do it if you need 300, that's quadruple what you told me and you should get a professional for that many.", "ESH. Not you so much, you sound like a really nice person, but the bill part was kind of petty and, I assume, out of character. \n\nMy mom would slap me and tell all her friends what an embarrassment I am if I behaved like your friend. She would also probably not be too impressed if I reacted the way you did, either. Reacting in, even justified, anger is never a good look on an adult. \n\nI think you should reach out to Stacey and say your piece gently. She did put too much on you and you kept with it, I don't know why. \n\nMaybe Stacey is just a moron. Or maybe Stacey doesn't like you as a friend and that's why she did this. I don't know anyone who would act like Stacey. If my friends did anything for my wedding, I'd be tripping over myself thanking them. They would be annoyed with all the gratitude they'd get from me. I'd cry. Stacey sucks.", "ESH.  You agreed to do it for no compensation and didn\u2019t say no when the ask wildly escalated (you would absolutely not have been the AH if you\u2019d said heeeell no), and then tried to unilaterally change the terms of the agreement after she didn\u2019t appreciate your charity enough.\n\nThe time to negotiate terms was before you agreed, so sending a bill is ridiculous and makes you look petty and small.\n\nShe obviously totally sucks for her sense of entitlement and her abhorrent attitude towards you and your time.  But it\u2019s not her fault you didn\u2019t set the boundaries you obviously needed.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through this, it sounds awful.

I'll be surprised if you get the money, though. If you don't, just write off that friendship.

That OP was going to make from a boxed mix.\n\nBoth Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines average about 24 cupcakes a box (a little over 3 boxes). Box mixes run between $1.50 and $3.50 a box. Even at the high end, that's $14 for the mixes. Add some oil and eggs and OP would still be between $20 & $25. Add the cost of frosting. OP would still be running less than $50, maybe less than $40.\n\nNot having an agreement to be paid with that initial request and baking plan is not surprising. Thats well within \"consider part of the wedding gift\" range.\n\nBut then in the last 3 weeks, the bride quadrupled the cupcake amount, insisted that they be entirely from scratch and added 3 large pans of baked beans, made to a specific recipe.\n\nEven if the original cost to OP was going to be $50, the bride's last minute demands increased that cost 18x.\n\nSubmitting the bill may be a bit rude.
