My friend let's call her Stacey (30f) recently got married. About 6 months before her wedding she asked me to make 75 cupcakes for her wedding. Baking is a hobby of mine and I have gotten very good at it. I agreed even though I'm not part of the wedding party and was doing this as a friend. Stacey also had 5 other people helping make the food. Well she calls me 3 weeks before the wedding and asks me to make 1 hungry pan of baked beans. At this point I'm still under the impression that it is going to be a smallish wedding so I say sure. So fast forward to 1 week before the wedding and she calls me and tells me the guest list has grew slightly. She then tells me she needs 3 huge pans of baked beans and wants me to use a specific recipe instead of my own and now needed 300 cupcakes instead of 75. As well as she doesn't want me to use box mix for the cupcakes (which I had planned to use since I'm buying all the ingredients for everything I'm making) she wants them to be homemade including the frosting. Told me I was a life saver and ended the call. Before I had a chance to say anything. So for 2 days before the wedding I was in my kitchen baking and cooking. While also taking care of my kids. So the wedding comes I take everything to the venue and helped set everything up. Fast forward to about a week after the wedding a mutual friend called me to ask about my thank you basket from Stacey. Come to find out she sent everyone a thank you basket for helping with the wedding (including the other people that helped with making the food) except me. I called her and talked with her, I figured I needed to let her know I had not gotten mine. I know that sounds entitled. I just thought since everyone else had gotten one maybe mine got lost. That's when she told me that she never sent me one cause I'm a stay at home mom so it was no big deal for me to help with stuff for the wedding but everyone else had actual jobs so it was an inconvenience for them to help but not me. I told her that it was hard for me to help as well and to except a bill in the mail from me. Which I did. I charged her for everything I had bought to make the food (I included copies of the receipts), a delivery fee, a set up fee, and charged her for my time to making everything. It totaled to right at $900 now I have a few mutual friends telling me I'm an AH for charging her.

That said she\u2019s definitely An AH that deserved a bill from the first addition to the order and forward: she clearly under-appreciates you and the lack of a gift basket is ridiculous.

Even at the high end, that's $14 for the mixes. Add some oil and eggs and OP would still be between $20 & $25. Add the cost of frosting. OP would still be running less than $50, maybe less than $40.\n\nNot having an agreement to be paid with that initial request and baking plan is not surprising. Thats well within \"consider part of the wedding gift\" range.\n\nBut then in the last 3 weeks, the bride quadrupled the cupcake amount, insisted that they be entirely from scratch and added 3 large pans of baked beans, made to a specific recipe.\n\nEven if the original cost to OP was going to be $50, the bride's last minute demands increased that cost 18x.\n\nSubmitting the bill may be a bit rude.

A statement of how much time and effort OP put into helping her wedding come off successfully. That OPs time and efforts are just as valuable as any of those other friends. That OP is worth as much as any of those other friends.\n\nIt's a statement that the bride was a sh!tty friend with an f-ed up view of the value of people's time and efforts and who is and isn't worth appreciating for helping her out.", "The bride never would have known the difference.", "Unfortunately, the bride will not care that she lost OP and will find more people she can take advantage of because terrible people continue to be terrible.  I just feel terrible for OP.", "But did OP really agree to the change? In the post it said the bride made the request for all the changes then hung up before OP could respond. Just because OP made the food per the request doesn\u2019t mean she was doing it for free. I think a judge would see it as the bride should have had an expectation of being charged since she made such a huge change from the original agreement.", "first thing judge will say ask if there's a contract.\n\notherwise , one party is just donating their time/resources.", "I think there\u2019s a fair chance quantum meruit or unjust enrichment could apply here. Even if the original free offer was \u201cfree\u201d, that was for 75 cupcakes.", "I don't think you're qualified to speak on the law.", "For sure, OP was manipulated.", "She was capable of calling back and saying no.  I get why she felt obligated not to, but a judge would probably say the same.", "Legally it does. By dropping off the food without any prior agreement to charging, the original agreement stood. If OP wanted to charge for the increased number, she would\u2019ve had to say that before she made the items let alone drop them off. She cannot drop them off and then three weeks later get angry and have legal protection to enforce a bill that didn\u2019t exist until OP was upset.", "There\u2019s no reasonable expectation that she would charge. Monetary compensation was never discussed. And she did not object to any of the changes.", "This went from a favour for a friend to  \u201cI'll have three pans of that and 300 of those\u201d. That's not a friendly favour but a huge order. There's no reasonable expectation _not_ to be charged when you just order stuff like that.", "Unfortunately for the OP, that\u2019s not how the law works. There was no discussion or agreement at any point that even mentioned financial compensation. And when the bride increased the quantities, the OP went along with it without objection, to the point that she both produced the items & delivered them. The bride\u2019s reasonable expectation was that it would be at no cost since there was nothing said or done to indicate otherwise.\n\nI feel sorry for the OP. Her friend sounds like an awful person. She certainly can send a bill if she wants, but the law is not on her side here. Morally and legally are not the same. Hopefully lesson learned."]}
