Thanks for all of your suggestions and to the guy who said he will cover my legal fees, thanks but my union already does that. I couldn't add the link so I would be glad if mods ads it somewhere.\n\nThis is a positive Update, not about my family but about myself. My family is a shenanigan by themselves that I will talk later in the text.\n\n4 days later I posted this, I got a phone call from my hematologist. There is a new drug that was recently approved for the treatment of MM and he suggested me to try it and I accepted it. It is just approved at August 2022.We started it a week ago and I am feeling better, maybe it is placebo, maybe it is seriously working I don't know but I am currently in treatment, left the palliative care and turned back to treatment care.10 days later I will have a PET-CT scan to look if there are any regressions but my hematologist is really positive and thinks this is working and for once in the last 6 months, my blood count is near to normal. Yesterday I managed to walk a mile without a shortness of breath so this is a win.\n\nThese are the good news, and now there are the bad news.\n\nMy family did not take the news of me having a lawyer to arrange my funerals that well. They came to my city, tried to find the house I was living(not the building my hospice care took place where my parents have visited me before) and they even tried to pester my hematologist to give them my house address and my siblings tried to pester the Union office to give the information they have about me. If my hematologist haven't given me a head up, I would be clueless about all of that. Myself, him and the Union have filed for harassment to the police and all of them currently have demand(C&D equivalent in Canada) letters against them. There is also an inadmissibility case going on against them and they are deported to US. The last mail I got them from was disturbing and all of my hometown is bashing through my DMs and I know nothing will be right in their eyes. I am even planning to give my U.S. Passport up(I am also a Canadian citizen) so I won't have any ties with that place. They still think I am bound to death but I am not planning to say anything to them about the current treatment. After the treatment maybe I will send a letter via my lawyer.\n\nI also learned my lawyer consulted my case to his friend who does these kind of cases and he helped him to organize everything in legal sense. In case if everything goes south, I have a stern plan and will that I don't have to worry about, if I am in remission, well I still have my ducks in a line and I won't have to worry about a thing.\n\nMy last funeral plan is, I bought a land that I will be buried with a cotton shroud as Muslims do and that land will be forested after my burial. I won't have anyone in the funeral other than my lawyer and my union director. It is all written in the will with very clear details and Union director said \"Each and everyone should have their own right to decide how they should be treated after death.\" I am glad that I have this kind of support.

For you, sadness that at your age you have to be planning your funeral. For you, happiness because you have had a turnaround in treatment and care. For comfort that you have a team that is supporting you through everything.\n\nTears for me, because I buried my partner last year after his treatments stopped working and there were no other treatments available for his cancer. And tears out of jealousy that he didn't get your hope and turn around.\n\nBest of luck to you with your treatments and your life.", "> Yesterday I managed to walk a mile without a shortness of breath so this is a win.\n\nTearing up a little.

I trust that you, with your strong sense of self and clear-eyed regard for both the future and the present, will be able to find happiness in this life, regardless of what you believe might happen to you after you die.\n\nYou rock.

I hope everything turns around for you. God Bless You.", "NTA. Also, please look into turning the land you plan to one day be buried on time conservation land. I\u2019m not sure how Canada is with this, or even how the US is in regards to having a body buried there, but i would look into what happens to the land after you\u2019re dead. It would suck for someone to buy the land and cut the forest down because it just got publicly auctioned after your passing. I own a ton of land in the US where I live, and we put about 90% into conservation, so long after I\u2019m dead, and my children and children\u2019s children and everyone for eternity, none of our land will ever be developed, just left as nature for others to enjoy.", "I'm happy the new meds are working and you've got a plan in place for later. \nI'm Stage 4 uterine/cervical with liver mets.

I am sorry you are having family trouble, I hope you get enough legal help to shelter you from the bulk of it. I like the burial plan you have outlined.

Just indulge in every minute of energy and joy you can feel!  It\u2019s all we ever have!  Those moments of love and health and sensation.  The feeling of water over skin, the feeling of touching and being embraced, the feeling of caressing fur, the feeling of joy or sadness as you read a great story, the feeling of first love and first heartbreak, the feeling of sickness and the moment of feeling truly well again, the feeling of life.  It is always limited and you are feeling it again and please focus on that amazing feeling and let the others deal with the bs!

Your way of seeing the world, of handling all of this, of being mindful and intentional and incredibly brave in the face of devastating news and events -- you're amazing. Everything you have planned for yourself is beautiful and true. You ARE having a funeral. It is YOUR funeral. Compare that to the weird rituals where people put makeup and clothing on a corpse and enclose it in an impermeable box ... you're  not the asshole, buddy. Not by a longshot.", "I wish for you the best.", "I am sorry your family caused so much stress.\nYou have an amazing story, coming to Canada less than a decade ago and buying a house in one of the most expensive cities in the world.\nI wish the best for you and that you get to enjoy many more years in your home and your beautiful city.", "I\u2019m glad you are on this side of the border. The border definitely offers you a degree of protection you wouldn\u2019t normally have even if you put a state border between you.\n\n I think there\u2019s a fee for giving up your US citizenship (the US has some weird tax laws linked to your citizenship) so you should find out what\u2019s required.  It requires an in-person visit with a consular or diplomatic official.", "I\u2019m so sorry about your family situation and the extra stress that provides. \n\nCongrats on the new treatment. A family member lives for a bit over a decade with MM so it can be done- the vast majority of that was a good quality of life. \n\nShe did all the things. Every natural thing you can think of plus radio and chemo. \n\nI hope you enjoy whatever life has planned for you.", "Im so glad to hear this update OP. I was livid when I went back and read your original post. There were so many people trying to say that funerals are for the living and trying to persuade you to buckle in regards to your families wishes instead of recognizing that hello, it's YOUR funeral. \n\nThey also failed to recognize that your family treated you like crap while you were living, so why should you cater to them when you're dying? Especially since they utterly disregard and disagree with what you want in regards to your death. \n\nMy father always told me that funerals aren't meant for the living, it's to honor the ones who are dead. That includes honoring their wishes. So when my dad wanted to be laid to rest in our traditional ways, being wrapped in a buffalo hide and being put out on a scaffold so the air and the earth could claim his earthly remains, I honored his wishes. A year later, I went back to the scaffold and collected his bones and buried them. I did the same for my mother, who wanted to have her bones buried where my father's were buried. \n\nThere were so many people that tried to stop me from doing this, saying I was taking away their right to grieve. I felt what they were saying, but ultimately it was my father's body, my mother's body, and they had the right to decide how they wanted to depart this earth. They did so much for me, the least i could do was honor their wishes.\n\nThe same goes for you OP, your family treated you awfully, the least they could do is respect what you want in regards to your bodily autonomy, even in death. Just because they want to put on a show of their so-called grief, doesn't mean you have to placate them. They should be trying to celebrate your life while you're still alive, instead of fussing over what happens when you die. \n\nI'm so glad that you qualified for the brand spanking new medicine in regards to your medical condition. I honestly hope that it gives you a new lease on life and I'm so glad that you have people in your life that care enough about you to respect your wishes.", "Good luck, OP. I hope things work out for you.", "I don't know your story, just what's here. But I wish you ever better and better health. Walking a mile is wonderful! I sincerely pray \ud83d\ude4f for you.\n\nSomeday, of course we all must die. I wish you many happy years before that time. But a simple shroud, returning us to the earth, our mother, so our remains may nourish new life, plants, trees, that's just lovely.", "Even in my state of NC (US) there are options for green burials. That's what I want. Requirements are natural fibers, for a shroud, (no chemicals), and/or a compostable \"cardboard \" box, also permitted. The areas have natural wild plants in place. So ppl might get a tree, over time, but I think they can be purposely planted also.\n\nI had a stroke in 2021, needed to give some thought. Having my remains embalmed with dangerous (to the living) chemicals, placed in a metal box, encased in concrete is dreadful to consider. Cremation costs a large carbon footprint, not what I want for my last \"act\" on earth. Just return me to Mother Earth. Humans have done burials this way for eons, unless you are an Egyptian pharaoh, etc. Seems best.", "I hope the trials help you live longer.\n\nBut if they don't I hope your quality of life gets better at least. \n\nYou are lucky to have peace of mind about how your affairs will be handled at the end. And good idea on the burial. I bet that land is lovely.", "I lost my father to cancer when I was 20. I am so happy that this is working so far for you and I hope it continues. Keep being absolutely wonderful and kicking ass", "I wish you health and happiness.", "Your way of funeral sounds beautiful. Trees and nature coming back to the earth is so lovely. I'm glad you stood your ground on this and as for your family they need to accept you made your choice. I hope this works for you and you recover.", "On another point to consider that although your funeral plan is beautiful. Please consider what the possible effects the drugs that you will have in your body at time of death will effect the ecosystem. It might still be possible but I would hate for your plan to harm the forest you hope to leave behind.\n\nI know that this has become an issue in sky burials where the toxins in human medicines have had a damaging effect on the ecosystems surrounding the place of burials.", "There's also a chance that the land has to be officially approved as a burial site, in many countries you can't just bury human remains anywhere you want.\n\nAND! A will is **not** the place to put instructions on funerals and immediate after death care. It can be weeks until a will is opened and read. The person who will be contacted upon your passing needs that information. Whoever will be responsible for handling the funeral (or lack thereof). Sounds like that will be the lawyer or union dude.\n\nBut it sounds like that won't happen soon anyway! I hope the drugs work this time and OP keeps us updated!", "I hope with all my heart that you get your miracle \u2764\ufe0f"]}
