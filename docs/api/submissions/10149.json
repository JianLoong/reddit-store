Thanks for all of your suggestions and to the guy who said he will cover my legal fees, thanks but my union already does that. I couldn't add the link so I would be glad if mods ads it somewhere.\n\nThis is a positive Update, not about my family but about myself. My family is a shenanigan by themselves that I will talk later in the text.\n\n4 days later I posted this, I got a phone call from my hematologist. There is a new drug that was recently approved for the treatment of MM and he suggested me to try it and I accepted it. It is just approved at August 2022.We started it a week ago and I am feeling better, maybe it is placebo, maybe it is seriously working I don't know but I am currently in treatment, left the palliative care and turned back to treatment care.10 days later I will have a PET-CT scan to look if there are any regressions but my hematologist is really positive and thinks this is working and for once in the last 6 months, my blood count is near to normal. Yesterday I managed to walk a mile without a shortness of breath so this is a win.\n\nThese are the good news, and now there are the bad news.\n\nMy family did not take the news of me having a lawyer to arrange my funerals that well. They came to my city, tried to find the house I was living(not the building my hospice care took place where my parents have visited me before) and they even tried to pester my hematologist to give them my house address and my siblings tried to pester the Union office to give the information they have about me. If my hematologist haven't given me a head up, I would be clueless about all of that. Myself, him and the Union have filed for harassment to the police and all of them currently have demand(C&D equivalent in Canada) letters against them. There is also an inadmissibility case going on against them and they are deported to US. The last mail I got them from was disturbing and all of my hometown is bashing through my DMs and I know nothing will be right in their eyes. I am even planning to give my U.S. Passport up(I am also a Canadian citizen) so I won't have any ties with that place. They still think I am bound to death but I am not planning to say anything to them about the current treatment. After the treatment maybe I will send a letter via my lawyer.\n\nI also learned my lawyer consulted my case to his friend who does these kind of cases and he helped him to organize everything in legal sense. In case if everything goes south, I have a stern plan and will that I don't have to worry about, if I am in remission, well I still have my ducks in a line and I won't have to worry about a thing.\n\nMy last funeral plan is, I bought a land that I will be buried with a cotton shroud as Muslims do and that land will be forested after my burial. I won't have anyone in the funeral other than my lawyer and my union director. It is all written in the will with very clear details and Union director said \"Each and everyone should have their own right to decide how they should be treated after death.\" I am glad that I have this kind of support. Thank you very much everyone.", "created_utc": 1676586230, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1142ysq/updateaita_for_not_having_a_funeral/", "score": 150, "replies": ["[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lb862/aita_for_not_having_a_funeral/)", "I'll be honest, I'm crying for this situation for you and me.  For you, sadness that at your age you have to be planning your funeral. For you, happiness because you have had a turnaround in treatment and care. For comfort that you have a team that is supporting you through everything.\n\nTears for me, because I buried my partner last year after his treatments stopped working and there were no other treatments available for his cancer. And tears out of jealousy that he didn't get your hope and turn around.\n\nBest of luck to you with your treatments and your life.", "> Yesterday I managed to walk a mile without a shortness of breath so this is a win.\n\nTearing up a little. Best of luck!", "good luck and best wishes!!", "OP, I hope that medicine can make your life long.  I trust that you, with your strong sense of self and clear-eyed regard for both the future and the present, will be able to find happiness in this life, regardless of what you believe might happen to you after you die.\n\nYou rock.  The blood relatives who want to project their insecurities onto you aren't really family.

I hope everything turns around for you. God Bless You.", "NTA. Also, please look into turning the land you plan to one day be buried on time conservation land. I\u2019m not sure how Canada is with this, or even how the US is in regards to having a body buried there, but i would look into what happens to the land after you\u2019re dead. It would suck for someone to buy the land and cut the forest down because it just got publicly auctioned after your passing. I own a ton of land in the US where I live, and we put about 90% into conservation, so long after I\u2019m dead, and my children and children\u2019s children and everyone for eternity, none of our land will ever be developed, just left as nature for others to enjoy.", "I'm happy the new meds are working and you've got a plan in place for later. \nI'm Stage 4 uterine/cervical with liver mets. My plans are made and will be carried out when the time comes.", "Wow... I am glad your new treatment is giving you some relief- I hope it continues.  I am sorry you are having family trouble, I hope you get enough legal help to shelter you from the bulk of it. I like the burial plan you have outlined. I've always liked the idea of being wrapped in a blanket and a tree planted. Imagine if we each got a tree! Wishing you well", "I am so sorry for your loss. \ud83d\ude1e I cannot imagine your heartbreak."]}
