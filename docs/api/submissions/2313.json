I am American and what you did is not unreasonable at all.  I would do the same.", "NTA - Your GF sounds like she is trying to cause drama. It is your flat, and if you want to host your relatives that is your choice.", "NTA. My husband is British and has been chewing my ears about how in Britain-land it\u2019s \u201csimply polite for family to get a hotel rather than bunk together, don\u2019t you know\u201d. I\u2019m Eastern European so that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing with my family in either direction, plus hotels are just so expensive here. This was up until his darling sister wanted to stay over in our city and couldn\u2019t afford a hotel of course, then it suddenly became temporarily ok to stay with family \ud83d\ude02. You do you, OP!", "NTA. That's weird topic to get into a debate over. Also American. We've done both; stay with family or stay at a hotel while visiting. Neither are right or wrong. It was, however, very gracious of you to give up your bed to the older relatives. That was very kind of you.", "I\u2019m French and your gf is a dick, no way I would let older relatives sleep on the couch or at an hotel if I could accommodate them \n\nNTA", "NTA.  It was your decision, not hers, to make.  If her questions were just trying to understand the differences, nothing wrong with that, but if her questions were trying to convince you that you were wrong, she was way out of line.  Either way, your decision, not hers.", "NTA. It just depends on the family and how the dynamics work. Not a big deal. She really doesn\u2019t get a say. It\u2019s one week. It\u2019s not a long term commitment.", "NTA and based.", "NTA \nand also this aint sounds like a cultural difference. Shes just a Princess that comes from a house hold with money.

I'm an American, and you hosting your great aunt and uncle, and having them sleep in your bedroom, is completely normal here if you don't have an extra room.", "NAH.  You're not wrong, but neither is she.  She's wondering WTH you're doing and why, as it's an alien concept to her.  That doesn't make her an AH.  It means she has different boundaries than you.  Therefore, theoretically if you got married, there'd be no way in hell she'd give up her bed to your aunt and uncle.  Interestingly, you're taking it as a personal attack on your autonomy and choices.  She's probably noting that you'll let your family run roughshod over HER boundaries which are just as valid as yours.", "NTA, but you sure are a little clueless. Most ppl use dating to find out if the current bf/gf is a match in the long run. With her questions she just tried to find out what your view is on hosting extanded family in your home. Instead of using this as a discussion about your relationship and if your pov would change when you maybe share a home with her in the future you just brushed her off. I guess she has a lot of thinking to do now ;)", "Well, you're kinda the AH for saying it that way.

This is literally what dating is for, at least for most of us.", "I'm french too and I would definitely find a hotel for my not-so-closed relatives.

Bossy little minx, innit?", "NTA and this is a weird thing to have a hang up on... I would have a sit down after about expectations with family in the future.

But you better believe if her dad needed to stay with us, he'd get our bed and we'd camp on the couch. Because he's 80 and we aren't. Geez.\nNta", "NTA\n\nBecause yes its true that she gets no say in your home life while not living together. However i would just ask was she doing this in a rude way or a curious way? I only ask because if there are cultural differences then it would make sense for her to ask a lot of questions. I mean if family staying with her is a foreign concept then yes shes going to ask her boyfriend questions that she may not feel comfortable asking other people that are in the same situation.", "NTA probably it was a little harsh the way you said it but you are in your right and it wasn\u2019t anything out of the ordinary. If you see this Relationship as something serious you need a calm and deep talk regarding family and boundaries", "NTA\n\nYou clearly communicated that you had family over, and she started demanding info like A) she had clout in the situation and B) she had a say in who stays at your apartment. Frankly the 20 questions was just her triangulating an angle of approach, something to needle at until she eroded you on the matter. It's a common enough tactic, you find one thing, and then another, and just hammer the person until they backdown or get pissed, and if they get pissed than you flip things again and play victim.\n\nAlso, this doesn't sound cultural. Admittedly, I'm not exactly up there on English/French hospitality culture, but on the whole your girlfriend sounds more like she was talking out of her ass and using your lack of overall knowledge of french culture to compel you.", "Your rules and customs not hers. Vive le France.", "I can't even imagine putting someone in the position of having to sleep on the couch in their own home, like if that's the only sleeping arrangement where I have a bed I'd rather stay at a hotel and not feel guilty about being an obtrusive guest.", "What\u2019s wrong with a hotel? That sounds entirely comfortable to me", "I'm American and there is absolutely no fucking way you could send some random 60+ year olds I'm vaguely related to to my apartment and expect me to give them my room. \n\nHell I'd be a bit pissed if my mom showed up and expected that, I'd probably pay for a hotel just to get them out.\n\nThis guy seems ok with it though so good for him, but it is a bit overbearing for your parents to just see you as an Airbnb for random family members.\n\nI wouldn't date someone if they commonly had family staying with them/us, but I also wouldn't interrogate them.

I'm Filipino and my husband is American. Filipinos always host family. My husband is very understanding. We've given up our room for my parents when we only had an apartment and though now we have a big house, we gave up our room for my aunt (the guest room hadn't been furnished yet). Younger family can sleep on the couch but older relatives out of respect are more accommodated.", "She's dating a person from a culture where family is a very important thing. If her way of finding out if he's 'worth her time' is to be confrontational and insult his cultural values while trying to pressure him into surrendering his own beliefs to accommodate hers, then she's not worth his time either.", "I'm not convinced this was the motivation behind her ' interrogation'. When you want to learn about someone's relationship with their family you don't ask why you are helping them.....you're helping them because they are family.", "It's weird that you're acting like not paying to visit her boyfriend for the weekend is some kind of meaningful benefit when she presumably has a home of her own. Yeah she's probably a little put out she's not going to be able to spend the weekend and probably have sex with her significant other which is a normal thing to feel.", "I\u2019m holding it for the next time my parents visit to remind him of his words and the upcoming overnighter from sister & niece \ud83d\ude01.

That's just being a good human.)", "Chinese American here - I\u2019ve had multiple times in my life my parents have invited people into my home because I\u2019m \u201cavailable\u201d in whatever city I live in.\n\nIt\u2019s so culturally normal and it\u2019s not a big deal at all at the end of the day. \n\nNTA", "NTA but I think you missed the point of your GF\u2019s questions. She trying to figure out what a future would look like with you and would it entail being displaced from her bed when relatives come to visit. So, you two have exchanged an important bit of information about your cultures, expectations and compatibility.", "NAH, I absolutely get why you did it but I also understand why she thinks its weird. The interrogation is because she's now wondering if this would be a regular thing should she continue a relationship with you. If you eventually get move in together, would she be expected to give up her bed for your family? If so how often? These are all questions she now has to consider moving forward.", "NTA, I'm Indian-American, and relatives *never* stay in hotels.

Not would I let them get a hotel room unless they wanted to.", "American here and my mom is one of seven. Her home is tiny. I barely know my aunt's and uncles anymore but I'd happily give my room and take the couch so they could be more comfortable. We grew up poor tho and kids went on air mattresses so the adults could have beds. To see extended family would have been impossible if we had to pay for hotels.", "Lol, he's pulling your leg so his peace isn't disturbed.", "Yeah, that's rubbish.  (Also English) if you're posh or your family's loaded, then maybe.  Otherwise, no.", "Same! I would be ashamed if I made my elders sleep on the couch while I sleep on the bed", "Hotels cost money and add travel to each day.  Which way is better depends on the household, but GF definitely went about this the wrong way.", "As someone from a culture where family is an important thing, it's very important to me that potential partners have the same view on family (Keep them the fuck away, we can grit our teeth through a visit on holidays). \n\nI got lucky with my spouse.", "True, but not that often, sadly.", "They probably read \"Indian\" and immediately jumped to a racist conclusion.", "I believe it has more to do with the Indian culture.  They would be considered elders and would be offered a place in the home."]}
