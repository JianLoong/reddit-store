I am American and what you did is not unreasonable at all.  I would do the same.", "NTA - Your GF sounds like she is trying to cause drama. It is your flat, and if you want to host your relatives that is your choice.", "NTA. My husband is British and has been chewing my ears about how in Britain-land it\u2019s \u201csimply polite for family to get a hotel rather than bunk together, don\u2019t you know\u201d. I\u2019m Eastern European so that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing with my family in either direction, plus hotels are just so expensive here. This was up until his darling sister wanted to stay over in our city and couldn\u2019t afford a hotel of course, then it suddenly became temporarily ok to stay with family \ud83d\ude02. You do you, OP!", "NTA. That's weird topic to get into a debate over. Also American. We've done both; stay with family or stay at a hotel while visiting. Neither are right or wrong. It was, however, very gracious of you to give up your bed to the older relatives. That was very kind of you.", "I\u2019m French and your gf is a dick, no way I would let older relatives sleep on the couch or at an hotel if I could accommodate them \n\nNTA", "NTA.  It was your decision, not hers, to make.  If her questions were just trying to understand the differences, nothing wrong with that, but if her questions were trying to convince you that you were wrong, she was way out of line.  Either way, your decision, not hers.", "NTA. It just depends on the family and how the dynamics work. Not a big deal. She really doesn\u2019t get a say. It\u2019s one week. It\u2019s not a long term commitment.", "NTA and based.", "NTA \nand also this aint sounds like a cultural difference. Shes just a Princess that comes from a house hold with money. I did exactly the same several times with my relatives", "NTA. Your place, your family, your rules. She should be more understanding about the fact that different cultures treat family visits in a different way.", "NTA, but she is.", "NTA", "NTA. I must be experiencing some culture clash too bc I\u2019d never send my family to a hotel, and yes, I always give up my bed for my mom or elders.", "Whether or not this is french culture (and from the comments it sounds like it isn\u2019t) you aren\u2019t french, and you aren\u2019t in france.

Either way it's not your fault and she's the AH.", "NTA. I'm an American, and you hosting your great aunt and uncle, and having them sleep in your bedroom, is completely normal here if you don't have an extra room.", "NAH.  You're not wrong, but neither is she.  She's wondering WTH you're doing and why, as it's an alien concept to her.  That doesn't make her an AH.  It means she has different boundaries than you.  Therefore, theoretically if you got married, there'd be no way in hell she'd give up her bed to your aunt and uncle.  Interestingly, you're taking it as a personal attack on your autonomy and choices.  She's probably noting that you'll let your family run roughshod over HER boundaries which are just as valid as yours.", "NTA, but you sure are a little clueless. Most ppl use dating to find out if the current bf/gf is a match in the long run. With her questions she just tried to find out what your view is on hosting extanded family in your home. Instead of using this as a discussion about your relationship and if your pov would change when you maybe share a home with her in the future you just brushed her off. I guess she has a lot of thinking to do now ;)", "Well, you're kinda the AH for saying it that way. I mean you could have used it as a teaching moment about the culture you came from vs hers.", "ESH  these were vaild questions", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
