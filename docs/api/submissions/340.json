While the problem lies with your performance, I don't have enough INFO to know whether you are at fault for being lazy or not at fault because you are depressed, have a learning disability, freeze up when you take tests, etc. \n\nSo let's put aside the finger pointing. Your parents have already invested  three months salary over the past two years, which is a considerable chunk of their income. And they are frustrated, as well as fearful, that you will neither pass the test nor get a job. Forcing you to earn the money to pay for the test is your mother's way of moving you into the workforce and ensuring that you will be motivated to pass the test.\n\nUsing your academic performance this year as a metric, are you prepared to score well on your exams? Don't ask yourself if you can pass them. Students who aim for just high enough to squeak by usually fail. If your self assessment exposes weaknesses, what can you do to work on those areas? Try to convince your mother to change her mind only if you can show her that you are prepared. Otherwise it's time to find a part-time job while you continue to work on your skills", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Full stop.  \n\nIf you are not legally an adult then ESH since your parents have an obligation to care for you to an extent and they should not make you feel like a burden - but:\n\n* Adult or not, you've failed it three times and you expect your parents to continue to pay for you to take the exam?  \n* I notice you didn't mention anything you've done since failing the last time that would lead you to expect a different outcome - why should they continue to fund your lack of effort?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Both parents go to work and often I'm the one at home doing chores, buying groceries, etc. Just one day I forgot to go for it and she got mad, made comments about how lazy and ignorant I am about everything\n\nWow - you have to do chores and buy groceries (with their money, I assume) and you somehow forgot to do this?  I often choose to skip chores or put off buying groceries, but I've never just forgotten to do them.  This seems a little far-fetched.  What else did you do on the day you \"forgot\"?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I have absolutely no idea what's going to happen to me and how I can ever handle life.\n\nWelcome to adulthood - whether you are legally an adult or not - the time is coming where you are the only one responsible for your life.  Maybe getting a job and some perspective before you totally burn through any remaining desire your parents feel to support you is just what you need.  I promise that this will be infinitely harder if they stop supporting you completely and you have to pay rent and feed yourself.  Get out of the house (to go to work), meet new people, and if nothing else pay for the exam if you choose to retake it.  I bet you'll take the exam and preparations more seriously if you have to work for a few weeks or months to afford it - and you just might regain some respect from your parents (and for yourself).", "Mental health is a complicated issue, people can be in therapy for years so there are no easy reddit answers for you OP.  I do think your mom isn't helping you to get through this though.", "Thank you for this comment. I think as of now I'm insecure of myself so that's why I go on pointing fingers because I fear it's all my fault\n\nI was a great student from the very start right up to high school. Top of my class every time in almost every subject. You could say I was a 'gifted kid'. But it all fell apart few years ago when I was doing really bad and enjoyed nothing. Continuously questioning myself what's the meaning of anything\n\nI don't know if I'm mentally ill but I haven't noticed many symptoms. I'm probably not autistic, can focus if I'm at peace. I learned things well and fast. But it's only natural I've gotten bit rusty after not actively doing anything for 2 years. My academic performance was only good during this time because I used to cheat whenever I could, classes weren't online so it was easy. I sorta regret it now\n\nI feel like I could have big ambitions. I feel like maybe if I go after going the things I want I could do good. But honestly part of me is just totally indifferent and feel sad, defeated and hopeless. I have some problems in my life and in my family, some that used to really bother me like struggling financially, hating my environment, not being able with connecting to others. No idea, maybe my bad feels stem from them\n\nI can understand why my mom is worried and fearful of my future and I agree. Matter is she doesn't know how to help so it's just awkward as she expects me to do good. I don't know exactly how to help myself but I'm trying I suppose\n\nI don't wanna ask for pity but guess I just fear I'll never feel better and I cry every other day thinking about it. I don't know, maybe if I try to move into the direction of my ambitions and go out there in the world I can be okay. I wanna get into uni\n\nI feel like I can do things, if I try to work on it and see how it goes if I could be more confident in me. It's like I know that everything can be okay, I just don't know how, exactly\n\nThanks for your comment, I appreciate it<3", "Alright, I got it. I'm the one in the wrong in her. On the account of groceries I genuinely forgot it  \n\n\nI might've known this more or less before I posted. The matter here's that I'm having a tough time with my mental health, and that's my problem. And nobody knows what to do about that. Not my mom, not myself and her actions don't help either.  Although this is probably not the sub to ask for anything in that regard  \n\n\nI can see how it makes sense I lost their trust in me. And on other hand I know I'm on my own here. Regardless, thanks for the perspective", "I think that's it. It's quite nuanced. I do believe having a therapist would've probably helped, but oh well. Guess I'm on my own. I don't know we'll see what I'll make of this"]}
