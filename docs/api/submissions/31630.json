Is it out of spite? \n\nHave you tried talking to him about this? Are you somehow just trying to keep a tally of when you think you\u2019ve utilized $3000 worth of his time, things etc - and at that point will you forgive the grudge and drop it? \n\nYou say your parents did not reprimand him, however 3 years ago you would have been 26 and 27.

Especially if SIL has nothing to do with it. Their wedding has nothing to do with your car, and if you choose to ruin their day with your grudge, then yeah\u2026 YTA. If you get them nothing - no, you\u2019re NTA. Don\u2019t attend, get them nothing or simply get a plain card is my suggestion. Settle up with him some other time.

Wrecking a car is a use of it, in a sense.", "Not sure where OP is, but if in the UK, the V5 is the registered keeper of a vehicle i.e. the person driving it most often, and where any speeding tickets etc would go. Most of the time the registered keeper and the owner would be the same person, but the V5 does not prove ownership. In fact iirc it specifically says that it doesn't prove ownership on it.

Both of those are way lower for a vehicle that is non operational versus one that is actively being used and the only person using it is the one borrowing it.   \n\nSo there should not be any assumptions of a gift when you're paying title and insurance on a car since you should pay title and insurance even when you're borrowing a car that is otherwise not being used.", "With something that valuable, you check first before assuming", "Picture of the car in black and white and one piece in color glued on.

Geez!", "I learned this phrase recently and I'm continually astounded since then how often it's applicable to different situations. There's a difference between having the right, and doing what is right. The brother had the right to sell the car and keep the cash. Keeping his word to his brother would have been the right thing to do. \n\nYou're correct that OP can't sue for what his brother did. But I feel like everyone harping on that is kinda missing the point. OP is entitled to view his brother as a dishonest thief who deserves some kind of punishment for his selfish two-facedness.

Not, \"I could send you to jail,\" but rather, \"in a just world a backstabbing, selfish liar like you deserves jail.\"", "How did the neither manage to sell it then? Under the table?", "I'm betting he would feign ignorance and claim, \"But you signed it over to me so I thought it was a gift\".
