They are not sorry for their actions, just for how i feel about it. That's not a real apology.\n\nHe knew he had to return the car at some point, because I told him verbally.

Not because you share genes. In signing your car over to him, you gave him a gift, in the eyes of the law and everyone besides the two of you. He knew there would be no consequences, social or legal, for keeping it. If you two didn\u2019t already have a close, loving relationship, he really didn\u2019t have anything to lose in doing what he did. If your opinion doesn\u2019t really matter to him, then why would he care that you think he\u2019s an asshole? He got what he wanted and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.", "I missed that.
