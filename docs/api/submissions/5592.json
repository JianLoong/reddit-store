I ask because if your siblings were requesting 70 inch flat screen TVs, Coach bags and what not and actually got them and they couldn\u2019t get a book they could order for a few bucks on Amazon, I think it speaks volumes about your family dynamic.

There's no logical reason you *shouldn't* be ungrateful - what do you have to be grateful for when there wasn't even the tiniest hint of thought put into your gift?\n\nIf you're feeling sassy about it you could always say something like 'oh im so sorry, you're right, I should be grateful about the clear lack of thought behind this gift - that really must've taken some effort, to hunt down something you knew I had no use for at all instead of simply picking something up off my list - thank you so much for putting so much thought and effort into how to best disappoint me today.\"", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting NTA votes.

And the rest of the family got thoughtful gifts they wanted and had on their list. I got nothing off my list and none of it was even expensive.

She kept insisting on buying gifts (my birthday, etc) because I guess it's her love language?

Last year I gave her a list of things that she could buy me (things I would use like soap from a certain store she knows I love) and she bought me clothes that I knew I wouldn't wear, haven't worn, and won't wear.

He was always soooo excited for this. \n\nI think I got the same dinos a few years in a row, but it was always the best gift  ever!", "That\u2019s the sweetest gifting story!! I love it!", "Awwwwwww!!!", ">I can't figure out if I did anything wrong, or if so, what, because I honestly have no idea what's going on. Hopefully someone here can give me a clue. Here's the relevant info, as far as I know.  \n>  \n>My brother and his wife are expecting their first girl after two boys. I love Ricky and Jace, and so does my SIL, but she has always wanted a girl and is very excited to be having one. She also wants to name the girl Chloe, as she loves that name. My brother hates the name Chloe and really wants to name their daughter Stephanie. They have been arguing about it for a few weeks, since finding out the gender.  \n>  \n>I got to my parents house late last night and my SIL was the only person still awake. We talked for a little bit, and she asked me the weirdest question. She asked me if I knew any stories about great aunt Stephanie. I was so confused. I literally said \"who?\"  \n>  \n>SIL clarified that she was talking about our grandmother's older sister that died when grandma was a little girl. Our grandma had two sisters, but their names were Judy and Lynn. There's no one in our family named Stephanie, as far as I know. I told as much to my SIL. She changed the subject after that, and we soon went to bed.  \n>  \n>This morning my brother and his wife were both sulking during breakfast. Even the kids could tell. Ricky kept saying \"stop being grumpy on Christmas.\" So it wasn't just my imagination. I got my brother alone and confronted him. He snapped at me for \"meddling\" and told me to stay out of his marriage.  \n>  \n>My brother is pissed at me, and my SIL won't even talk to me. I'm afraid to say anything to my parents and drag them into this, especially since I still don't know what this is. Either my grandmother had a secret sister that I don't know about but my brother does for some reason, or my brother lied to his wife to convince her to name their baby Stephanie. Both options seem equally weird to me. Maybe there's a third possibility I'm not seeing?  \n>  \n>Reddit, am I the asshole? If so, please explain to me why. I don't want to be the reason Christmas is ruined.  \n>  \n>Update: Most awkward Christmas Eve dinner ever. Gotta keep this short; lots going on. Everyone now knows what my brother was doing with the kids names(except the kids obviously). They are pissed. Weirdly my mom is the most pissed. A Christmas truce is in place for the kids, so no fighting on the holiday. However the baby is definitely going to be named Chloe. My brother very quickly backed down when my mom said some few choice words to him. The topic is completely banned for the rest of festivities, so, for now at least, they've tied a bow on the situation.  \n>  \n>Christmas morning update: Aside from some glaring over a couple of the boy's stocking stuffers (Robin Funko pops) everything went well with the gift opening (as well as being woken up at 5:30 AM by being jumped on by one's nephews can). I think my brother realizes he crossed a line and has been very attentive to his wife. He mentioned getting Chloe's name embroidered on some stuff when they get home. He even told mom he would do the Christmas breakfast so she could have a break and he gave me an \"I'm sorry\" grin when I opened his gift.
