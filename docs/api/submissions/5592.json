What's the reason behind making lists, if they're not used. You are not ungrateful if you don't like an unwanted, thoughtless and useless gift. Kind of looks like they forgot about you, came up with an emergency present and now try to guilt trip you instead of owning up for their mistake. Ask for the receipt and exchange the pjs for something you will enjoy.", "Nta  when it's family it hurts when no thought and no effort is put onto you gift.

And it sends a message that they don\u2019t care or aren\u2019t interested in being thoughtful with gifts for you, but they are for your siblings - who let\u2019s remember got more than one thing from their lists, and you got one thing that wasn\u2019t on your list, pyjamas. \n\nI\u2019d be bummed too.\n\nI\u2019m never sure why we\u2019re expected to be \u201cgrateful\u201d for unenthusiastic, unthoughtful, crap, especially from family. \n\nI\u2019m curious though, is there a reason someone thought pyjamas were a good gift? You sleep naked. Do you get up in the morning and not put pants on before going to the bathroom or joining everyone at breakfast?

Then you can buy yourself something you'll enjoy. But if you're gonna sulk about it then YWBTA. You're a grownup and got a present you did not like, you'll be ok.

Sorry that they rather spend money on pricy gifts then practical ones for your hobby, you really wanted.\n\nbut gift giving is for both parties, sometimes if the giver finds nothing on the list they would want, they go and buy something generic, that the receiver then can not use, like in your instance.", "NTA because you were told to give lists and none of the things on yours were hard to get. It's an awful feeling to not ask for much and still not get what you wanted. I've been using a list for years, even divided it into price brackets with the smallest items being worth like a dollar and easily found online or in stores and I always get the answer that it is too hard and they don't know where to look so I always get flamingo themed shit I don't use because I once was fond of flamingo's when I was a child. \n\nAsk for the receipt so you can return it. Tell them you want to buy a book from your list with it or something.", "NTA but it is disappointing.
