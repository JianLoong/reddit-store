I ask because if your siblings were requesting 70 inch flat screen TVs, Coach bags and what not and actually got them and they couldn\u2019t get a book they could order for a few bucks on Amazon, I think it speaks volumes about your family dynamic.

There's no logical reason you *shouldn't* be ungrateful - what do you have to be grateful for when there wasn't even the tiniest hint of thought put into your gift?\n\nIf you're feeling sassy about it you could always say something like 'oh im so sorry, you're right, I should be grateful about the clear lack of thought behind this gift - that really must've taken some effort, to hunt down something you knew I had no use for at all instead of simply picking something up off my list - thank you so much for putting so much thought and effort into how to best disappoint me today.\"", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting NTA votes.
