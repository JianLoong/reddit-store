He said they meant something to him. I said I'm glad they do and I'm genuinely happy for him but unlike him I can't get legally married, doesn't mean I'll stop calling my husband, a husband. He also took that personally and called me TA for minimizing what marriage means to him. To this day he won't talk to me and I'm just so confused.

Just because the state won't recognize the seriousness of your commitment doesn't mean your brother and other people shouldn't.", "NTA. But , by definition, you\u2019re not married. I can\u2019t just call my girlfriend my wife and it actually be true, if we\u2019re not really married. Marriage is a word used to describe couples that have actually went through the process, and/or have a legal contract verifying the marriage. Saying that you\u2019re married doesn\u2019t make it true in the eyes of most people who are actually married. I\u2019ve never understood the point of getting married to begin with, aside from the stuff like financial benefits, it\u2019s pointless, and has no other purpose other than claiming to have a permanent relationship with that person. Really it should be inconsequential to other people whether you and your boyfriend are married or not, especially if you\u2019re dedicated to the person you\u2019re with. I wouldn\u2019t care about whether I was married. It\u2019s just a word, and doesn\u2019t change anything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
