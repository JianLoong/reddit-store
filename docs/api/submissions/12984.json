{"id": 12984, "submission_id": "11zan6r", "title": "AITA for insisting the bride let me wear makeup at her wedding because a burn victim is allowed to?", "selftext": "Title explains it all but I'll explain the rest. I had a verbal argument with my sister about her wedding next month.\n\nI am F24 and my sister Enca is F27. Unlike most sisters we actually get along for the most part, but that's not on today's menu. Enca got engaged to her male fianc\u00e9 in October and they promptly began wedding planning. I was chosen as maid of honor a while ago, and four women will be bridesmaids in addition to myself. Enca is not like most of us and instead decided on an outdoor beachy-type wedding. I have no problem with this, but I didn't quite realize how primitive she wanted it to be until yesterday.\n\nYesterday Enca showed me the five ivory one-size-fits-all \"bridesmaid dresses\" (thneeds) and let me choose which one I wanted since I'm the maid of honor (they all have different sleeves/cut-outs). This felt incredibly tacky and the one I liked most doesn't actually fit comfortably, but I didn't want to spoil the moment. And before you ask, yes she is entirely unprepared for her will-be flop wedding, and yes I did tell her to buy bridesmaid dresses back in November, and no she did not listen to me. Enca's wedding dress is navy blue satin, handmade and tailored by her fianc\u00e9's mother. It actually looks fine, but I addressed my concern that she wouldn't stand out as the bride in it. And here is where the train switches tracks and plummets down the grand canyon.\n\nEnca told me that she realized this too, and her plan is to have (almost) none of the women in the wedding party wear makeup but her. She will wear \"full glam\" and an updo, while us bridesmaids will wear beachy waves and a spray tan, at most. I was shocked at this because I am not comfortable going in public without at least some concealer and mascara, let alone a wedding. Plus I have a chronic skin condition, which Enca has and has worse.\n\nI told Enca that she couldn't possibly do this because a bridesmaid, our cousin Alicia, is a burn survivor and *always* wears makeup on her arms and face. Enca told me she will allow her to wear makeup anyways, which brought me back to whether she'd outshine Enca, and Enca said \"there's no way *she* would overshadow me.\" \n\nI pleaded with Enca and asked if I could wear makeup too. If she really cared about looking like the bride, she should've picked a white dress. She said no and that I should be grateful for being in her wedding because \"there's no telling when or if \\[I'll\\] ever have my own.\" I continued arguing, saying how uncomfortable and naked I feel without makeup, but she won't hear me out and wants me to suck it up. My insecurities are just as valid as Alicia's, if not more because I'm literally the bride's sister and should be allowed to look presentable.\n\nSo am I TA here?", "created_utc": 1679550930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zan6r/aita_for_insisting_the_bride_let_me_wear_makeup/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No complaining or judgment. \n\nSisters comment about your cousin, comes across like sister meant to insult cousin for appearance.  Very rude, burn survivor or not. It's not acceptable to put people down. The bridal party dress code is also strange. I feel minimal makeup would make everyone feel more comfortable. Especially since she knows you have this skin condition that leaves you feeling insecure about your appearance. \n\nYou always have the option to turn down being in the bridal party. Given it's your sister though....most likely this will lead to bigger conflicts. \n\nPersonally, I would do everything possible to enhance my makeup free appearance before the wedding. Microblade my brows (dont do this unless you can get an appointment basically before the end of this week). Dye my eyelashes or get eyelash extension. Quality skin care regime. Tinted moisturizer or sunscreen. Sun screen setting powder. Tinted chapstick. Spray tans do help with the appearance of some skin issues but can also make some more noticeable. This is morally questionable. But if you start wearing this makeupfree look asap, she might not notice the day of the wedding.", "NTA, though your experience is not comparable to that of a burn victim.  Frankly, I would just wear some minimal makeup anyway.  The only time I go anywhere barefaced is if I am having surgery. It\u2019s a weird thing to request and won\u2019t actually have the effect that she thinks.  I think it would just draw attention to the fact that bridesmaids who normally would be wearing makeup aren\u2019t for some reason, and people will be wondering why and talking about that instead.", "NTA\n\nDo you come across as rude in some of your lines ? Yeah. But if her wedding is poorly organized, it is poorly organized, and I can understand why you are frustrated about everything. \n\nBut mostly, you being rude doesn't compare to her being an ass. I have skin conditions myself, was even bullied during my childhood for them, and they weren't even that bad and only on my limbs, so I can fully understand why you'd wanna wear makeup. Wearing makeup to conceil skin issues or scars is not the same as wearing makeup to be pretty, your sister should make an exception for your cousin and you. Her comments about Alicia and you are horrible too, obviously. She just sounds very entitled and presomptuous. Like ... More than you should be on your wedding way, at least. \n\nAlso, while the way you said it was clumsy, I can assure you most people shitting on you because you say you need makeup like your cousin has never seen or had a severe skin condition.", "NAH, the bride is absolutely allowed to set (what i think are) unreasonable expectations of their bridal party. \n\nHowever, you all are absolutely allowed to decide to decline to be in the wedding party. if you would be significantly uncomfortable standing in front of the guests without makeup on, which, for what its worth, is totally valid and fine, there is the option of declining the invitation to be your sister MOH and instead choose to sit with the congregation. That probably wont go over well, but it may go to show your sister how uncomfortable you are with her request.", "NTA\n\nWhile its not your wedding, and your sister seems to want something that most would think is odd, it is her and her fianc\u00e9's day so its up to them.\n\nHowever telling someone they cannot wear basic makeup is a step too far.  If you are uncomfortable because of your skin condition then you should be able to.  \n\nI would say be happy for your sister though.  Don't talk her wedding down even though she seems to be being a bit of a bridezilla about some of it.  Enjoy they day for her even if its not what you would choose.", "NTA. Your sister\u2019s rebuttals are awful. While this is their wedding, you can opt to not partake in this given their stipulations. Moreover, their inability to plan accordingly unfortunately resulted in this mess, but you don\u2019t have to agree to any of it.", "NTA \u2026so far. You have every right to desire wearing makeup and it\u2019s definitely an unnecessary and sucky ask on her part. However it is her wedding. It was a good on your part that u talked to her, and that u now know she\u2019s gonna stand her ground. Personally, I\u2019d get the other bridesmaids together and have a group discussion if possible. But do not act like you\u2019re gonna go makeupless and wear it come wedding day, and do not try and push the envelope on your own. See what the others think and come up with a plan, back off and deal with it, or tell her you won\u2019t participate in the wedding if that\u2019s a deal breaker.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
