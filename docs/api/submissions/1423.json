{"id": 1423, "submission_id": "ymervw", "title": "AITA for being upset at the gift my boyfriends ex wife gave to him?", "selftext": "My boyfriend (M 33) and I (F 24) have collectively been dating for 1 year. He has an ex wife (F 33) they were together for 10 years and married for 7 of those years. They have not been together for roughly 6 years, yet she is still very much so in love with him. They do have 3 children together and I myself have one child from a previous relationship. Short back story, ex wife lives quite a few states away and only comes up a couple times out of the year to visit her children, she rarely calls and they do not like her due to her pretty much being non existent. She doesn\u2019t even keep them the full time she is supposed to, when visiting with them. I love my boyfriend and I trust him with everything and anything, he is a very good man and father to his children. \nMy problem ensues, when ex wife gifts him with eagles tickets for a Philly game, so he will be traveling and going to see them. Now I am very happy for him, and i am not mad at him in the slightest he is very excited and honestly from how hard he works, he deserves it! I did express to him the fact that I am not mad at him but at his ex wife for doing such and thing and for the fact he did say that yet again she has given him the best present he has ever received. She was also placed at the top for something else I do not want to mention, but that did bother me and I let him know that. His ex wife is a very shady person and does not do things from the kindness of her heart but to gain something from it. I feel as if it was a power play to buy his love. Ex wife has been making plans to move closer and has the idea that if she does he will break up with me for her and they can be a big happy family once again. He has told her that would never happen. Now he thinks I am over reacting and we haven\u2019t spoke much since, he also added that i made him regret telling me and me being upset stripped him of his excitement which I did apologize for and explain that was not my intent what so ever, but to share my feelings and I did explain why I felt the way I did. Again his ex wife is a true terror, my boyfriends kids absolutely love me and get excited to see me yet hate their mom and there is very good reasoning behind that. Not to mention that fact again that she is still very much so IN LOVE with my boyfriend and wants to be with him, she is a narcissist at its finest. Maybe I am looking at this one sided, but ex wife does know the eagles is his favorite team, and he has never seen them play in person, I could just be letting my emotions cloud my judgement and possibly overthinking the entire thing. I although really can\u2019t help but to feel she bought him that present to buy his love.\nI guess my question would be was I in the wrong to be upset over the situation at hand? Did I over react? How would you feel being put into that circumstance?

If he loves his kids, he'll never forgive her for abandoning them, and they don't like her so why worry about it? Jealousy and insecurity are not attractive traits. \n\nHowever... if he tells you the things that she is better at than you are, then he sucks. But maybe keeping you off balance is a game he likes to play. Maybe he likes it when you're jealous. Maybe that's why he chose a GF 10 years younger than he is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You bf is feeding that with his comments. The ex wants to be with someone who doesn't want to be with her.", "This whole post sounds very one sided without any concrete examples of why she's awful. I'm going YTA.", "I\u2019m unsure what YTA means, but, ex wife, she is still in love with my boyfriend, she has sent him many love letter through email proffering her love for him. She attempted suicide and blames it on my boyfriend for not wanting to be with her. She is very hot and cold, she never truly want to be around her kids just him, she wants to move up where we live for them to get back together. She will call to talk to my boyfriend but not her own children half the time. Within their marriage when they were together she was abusive towards him. She\u2019s not a good person in general she tried her best to get under the person my boyfriend is dating skin. She does things for her own benefit and any time she does something wrong everyone but her is to blame, no matter what.", "We have dated for all together a year but not consecutively, we dated for 6 months, broke up due to my boyfriend working 80-100 hour weeks just to come home to the same kind of stress (my son has autism). We got back together a few months ago, his hours are better, we were friends beforehand, collectively was what I felt to be a better word to use rather than all together.", "I\u2019m not insecure about the relationship per say, I\u2019m just bothered by the fact that she did that, we again have collectively been together for 1 year we did break up for a brief amount of time, during the time we dated previous to our break up, she sent him an email every week for 4 months about how she was still in love with him. It\u2019s very hard to explain the entirety of how the ex wife is, but I do have a huge feeling as to why she did what she did and I\u2019m upset with her, not with him, but he did think I was over reacting. Not to mention when ex wife knows he is in a relationship she does everything she can to try and sabotage it.", "I replied to you but I don\u2019t think it actually replied it is although in the comments.", "Your son is not his?  How old is he?", "My son is 3. He likes my boyfriend, myself and my sons father (26 M) broke up almost 3 years ago due to cheating, arguing and gaslighting pretty much. My sons father is still in the picture, we split custody, my boyfriend and my sons father have met."]}
