I also was let go from my job and didn\u2019t have the energy to find another one. My gf broke up with me after our lease expired and demanded I pay her back for the 2 months rent I couldn\u2019t pay because I wasn\u2019t working. After she left I moved back with my parents. I was pretty devastated because I didn\u2019t have a job and gf and it was like I was a teenager again living in my parents house who were looking down on me for failing at life.\n\nI don\u2019t think I treated her badly I just wasn\u2019t feeling great at the time. I had been going to doctors a lot for the last couple years. They could never find anything wrong with me. I was diagnosed with Arthritis previously. Finally I was referred to a specialist who did another blood test and found I was high in antibodies and diagnosed me with Lupus. I read about the symptoms and they fit better than Arthritis so I hope it\u2019s a definitive diagnoses. \n\nI was diagnosed less than month after she broke up with me and I told my friends about it. We share a lot of friends so when they asked why we broke up I said she just didn\u2019t like my attitude or something and they filled in the blanks and began accusing her of breaking up with me because of my diagnoses. She broke up with me before the diagnoses but I think she did break up with me because I wasn\u2019t feeling good and not giving her attention. \n\nShe texted me to tell me to tell our mutual friends she broke up before the diagnoses and I told her I didn\u2019t clarify the dates and they made their own assumptions. She accused me of intentionally ruining her friendships and not paying her back for the rent I owe her. Why should I when she broke up with me? But AITA for not clarifying with my friends she broke up before the diagnoses and not paying her back for rent?", "created_utc": 1673472400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109ghz2/aita_for_letting_my_ex_gf_take_the_blame_and_not/", "score": 1098, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You asked \u201cwhy should I when she broke up with me\u201d, but her breaking up with you doesn\u2019t negate the responsibility you had to pay rent when you were also living there. You owe her that money. Also, you\u2019re the AH for intentionally going along with their accusations that she left you because of your diagnosis when you KNOW that\u2019s not true. Also, your health problems aren\u2019t her responsibility.", "YTA. Letting people assume your ex is ableist is an asshole move just because you didn't feel like clarifying.", "Do you think that her breaking up with you means you no longer owe her money? That's not how that works. YTA\n\nAnd yes if you let your mutual friends continue to think she broke up with you for having lupus then YTA for that also.", "YTA. She broke up with you and it had nothing to do with you having Lupus.  You know that but you want her to seem like the AH to your friends.  You\u2019re also an AH for not paying her back the rent money.", "\"She accused me of intentionally ruining her friends and not paying her back for the rent I owe her.\" THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED\n\nYTA Pay her back, you owe her that rent money. You can't just get out of your responsibilities because someone hurt your feelings, that's not how adulting works. \n\nTell your mutual friends the truth. You're a manipulative asshole and you know exactly what you did.", "YTA, she covered YOUR rent when you were down and out without a job and your way of \u201crepaying\u201d her for helping you is to spite her. You\u2019re pathetic and she dodged a thousand bullets not being with you. Her needs weren\u2019t being met and my guess it was over a long period so rightfully so she left. Something\u2019s telling me you\u2019re leaving information out, but yep YTA.", "YTA. That was rent that you were supposed to pay. And there\u2019s no non-malicious reason to lie by omission to your friends about what went down. Them being under a false impression harms her and not you. I hope you\u2019re getting your health under control.

The relationship wasn\u2019t working, she\u2019s allowed to move on.", "YTA - There's no reason to *knowingly* let your friends believe she broke up with you because you have Lupus. Her breaking up with you also isn't an excuse to not pay back rent that was owed before the breakup. \n\nIf you had an agreement to pay rent prior to the breakup, then you have an agreement to pay rent after the breakup.\n\neta: OP states that he was responsible for half the rent. She temporarily covered the rent during his unemployment. He thinks he doesn't owe it because she didn't \"make him promise\" to pay it back.", "YTA. You  owe, you pay. And yes, don't let her take the hit for untrue callous behavior. Why should you when she broke up with you? Because otherwise you are an AH. Stop whining. It's exactly why she was exhausted with you.", "YTA for not clarifying with your friends. Letting them come to their own conclusions without all the information is misleading and petty.\n\nYou are also TA for not paying her back. At the very least, have a conversation with her about when and what you can pay her.\n\nI'm sorry about your health, and I hope you can get healthy again.

You lived together, you need to pay your part, even after break up. Yes, you are ill, but if your ex didn't say \"I'll cover these rents, no need to pay back\" you NEED to pay your part.\n\nTelling your friends is fine, if it went as you said. No need to clarify anything imo. But you are still responsible for the break up too.... Even when sick, so it's not all on her.", "YTA - Healthy, sick, diagnosed, suspected, or just a jerk. No matter what your tale is, you were on the lease and you owe the back rent.", "YTA. You got dumped and now you\u2019re being childish and petty about it, of course you shouldn\u2019t have let friends think that and obviously should pay her whatever money you owe her what gives you the right to think you should live rent free? She is clearly much better off without you.", "YTA.  Your refusal to accept that you owed your portion of the rent speaks volumes about your attitude. The further weaponization of your diagnosis to ruin her friendships is also gross.  Just because you are sick doesn't mean you aren't also an asshole.", "YTA - you're punishing her for breaking up with you, but what was she supposed to do if she was unhappy in the relationship? Sign the lease for another year? Keep paying your rent for you? \n\nSometimes relationships break down. That's just life. But lying to your friends, (and lying *by omission* is still lying, btw), is going to end up costing you your friendships, too. \n\nAlso, you just texted her the evidence to prove you were lying to make her look bad. She's definitely already screenshot it, mate.", "YTA. Having a condition can make life difficult, but it doesn't excuse you from responsibility to things you agreed upon. You lived there too; you ought to pay a fair share of the rent. And while you aren't obligated to clear up misunderstandings, it sure is an ass move to know about it causing issues between her and friends and not do anything about it. This all sounds like you're trying to get some form of lazy revenge on her for breaking up with you.", "YTA", "YTA on both fronts. Clear up the confusion and pay her back for the lease you BOTH signed up for", "YTA for a good number of reasons. Letting your friends think she was the AH, ruining her friendships, not paying her the rent, lying just so many.", "YTA.  You owe her the rent money.  Also, you're TA for letting your friends think she broke up with you because of your diagnosis.  You're being petty and dishonest.", "YTA, lupus runs in our family. Open lesions and gnarled joints have never been an excuse for any of my affected family members to scam someone out of two months rent or to ruin someone's social life - especially someone who supported you for two entire months while you did nothing to keep up your end of the bargain. Do better.", "YTA. Are you seriously 32 years old? Because this reads like you're 18. You don't get to withhold money from people and lie to friends because your girlfriend broke up with you. Man up here.", "YTA - You are lying to your friends about her in order to make her look bad because you're mad she dumped you because she wasn't being treated right in the relationship. I'm sorry you are having severe health concerns but that's not her problem anymore.", "YTA dude\n\nYou owe her for the rent. You not happening to have the money  because you didn't have the energy to work isn't a valid excuse - you still need to pay your share. Your emotions due to the breakup don't change the fact that you owe her for the rent.\n\nHonestly, I get going through difficult times, I've struggled too, but depression / low energy / oh I have this illness / being unemployed / being really upset a relationship ends /etc whatever are not valid reasons to skip out on rent or any other debt.\n\nPay what you owe. YTA, for both of your questions. You're better than this petty blame-shifting debt-dodging to punish your ex for daring to break up with you shit. Come on", "YTA and a manipulative one too. You owe the rent money, pay it. Also tell your friends the truth. You were moody and although the diagnosis explains the moodiness, there was no way of knowing at the time plus after the way you\u2019re still behaving I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to be in a relationship with you.", "Yes, YTA.\n\nYou didn't pay rent for 2 months. You owe her that money and should repay her. If you wanted to avoid paying rent, you should have moved back in with your parents right away instead of staying in an apartment with her. You live there, so you need to pay your share of the rent.\n\nSimilarly, YTA for not telling your mutual friends the truth. Letting them \"fill in the blanks\" and guess wrong is an AH move for sure.", "YTA - the debt is owed.  She paid the debt you were both liable for.  You want her to help pay the price for what happened as a result of your illness\n\n(1) I don't think I treated her badly but I wasn't well at the time = I treated her badly because I wasn't well\n\n(2) she wasn't as supportive as I needed and I looked foolish to everybody - living with my parents\n\n(3) if she had supported me like my parents and stayed, she would have seen I had good reason to be in a bad mood and unemployed\n\n(4) she took your mutual friends after the break because they didn't want to spend time with somebody sick, unemployed and living with his parents.", "Your illness is not an excuse to not pay your portion (it doesn\u2019t matter if you were dating or not. It was your portion. Pay it) of the rent, and there is definitely no excuse for allowing your friends to draw an improper conclusion about what is going on. You may not have felt good but from her perspective, you were shutting her out and not communicating. Lack of communication is a fine reason to break up with someone. In fact, she didn\u2019t need any reason to break up with you. She doesn\u2019t owe you anything, especially free housing. YTA and pay your rent.", "YTA. \n\nYou owe her the money for the roof that was over your head for that period of time. That\u2019s just a fact. She\u2019s not financially responsible for you, together or apart. \n\nYou\u2019re intentionally letting people make incorrect assumptions about the reason she broke up with you.

You\u2019re full of excuses and completely unable to take responsibility for your actions. YTA.", "YTA \n\nStop playing the victim. You owe her the rent money regardless of your breakup. You are blaming her for basically everything that is going wrong in your life. The bottom line is that she doesn't want to be with you. Be an adult and stop sharing details of your relationship. \n\nYou need to either get a job or apply for disability. Adults take care of themselves. You need to stop feeling sorry for yourself.

That money has nothing to do with your diagnosis.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nShe broke up with you because (for whatever the reason may be) you were neglecting your relationship, unemployed and leeching off of her financially.\n\nYou are now knowingly allowing people to think the worst of her, and still have not paid her what you owe her.\n\nI\u2019m sure your diagnosis relates to your behavior, but she also did nothing wrong and your attitude here tells me there was more wrong with your relationship than can be explained by illness. You sound selfish and apathetic to her experience dating you.", "At some level, it doesn't matter why she broke up with you.  She didn't want to be in a relationship with you anymore, period.  End of story.  \n\nYTA for letting people believe a certain context that you fully admit is not true and cast aspersions on her character in your social circle.  You are knowing let this misunderstanding continue.  That is cruel.\n\nAlso, you are a grown ass man, so YTA for not paying your debts.  You aren't doing yourself any favors by reinforcing your inability to Adult.  Even if you pay it off at a slow pace, she supported you when you couldn't support yourself.", "No comment on the friends issue, but YTA for not paying her back rent.\n\nYou guys were broken up at that point. You were roommates at best and would have been expected to split the rent evenly. The fact that you weren't working because you didn't have energy sucks, especially since it was from an undiagnosed autoimmune disease, but she's not responsible for that.\n\nCan you get your parents to help you out in paying her back?", "YTA.  Your ex could have broken up with you for any reason she wanted, if you owe her money for rent, you are obligated to pay her back.  I understand you may feel hurt and you may not be feeling well, but shirking your responsibilities and owing your ex money is not going to make you feel better about yourself.  Man up and pay her back, get on the right treatment, get back on track with your life, and you can move forward from there.", "YTA I\u2019m sorry everything in your life is going wrong, but that\u2019s no excuse to continue treating your ex poorly. \n\nPay her back and clarify to your friends what really happened. Are you not embarrassed by your actions here?", "I\u2019m sorry about the rough time you went through. But in this case, YTA.\n\nEven if she broke up with you, you still owe her the money. A debt doesn\u2019t stop being a debt just because you\u2019re broken up. She still covered you when you weren\u2019t working, and you owe her for that. And letting mutual friends believe that she broke up with you because of your diagnosis, when it happened beforehand, is just spiteful.\n\nYou need to tell your friends the truth and not lie by omission. How was your communication during this period? You say \u201cI don\u2019t think I treated her badly,\u201d but how well did you communicate how you were feeling at the time? Did you offer her explanations or brush her off? Did you still make some time for her during this period? My mom has also been diagnosed with Lupus but she still had time to spend with others, so while it\u2019s understandable that you may not have felt up to it *all* the time, did you still make some effort to spend time with her?\n\nYou\u2019ve been going through a rough time which I\u2019m sorry for, but spiting her and refusing to pay back your debt won\u2019t make you feel better. Do all you can to help yourself, including paying back the debt and clearing the air with your friends.", "YTA\n\nStiffing her on the rent because you are too lazy to get a job or keep it is definitely a dick move, and so is implying to your mutual friends that she broke up with you because of your health reasons is also a major AH move.  It's an AH move towards her, and you are essentially lying to your friends also, so you are being a double AH.", "YTA.\n\nYou still owe her rent money regardless of anything else. The fact that you're the kind of person who is not willing to means she probably made the right decision in breaking up with you.", "Do you even need to ask? YTA. Despite your hard times you still have responsibilities like maintaining your relationship and paying rent. Pay your owed rent and set the record straight with your friends. You\u2019re a liar, just to make you feel better.", "In what universe are you not the AH? Are you delusional? Jeez", "YTA. You still lived there. You owe her rent money. She has the right to break up with you if the relationship isn't working for her. I'm sure your overall sucky attitude has more to do with it than anything. You are a major asshole for not clearing up that she didn't know about the diagnosis.", "She was right to leave you. You\u2019re a dishonest, manipulative person.\n\nYTA", "My, you are a spoiled and entitled little piss-ant, aren\u2019t ya?\n\nYou lived somewhere and someone else covered your rent for 2 months when you couldn\u2019t, you need to be an adult and reimburse your ex for your agreed upon living expenses.  Rent has to be paid regardless of your current medical, employment or relationship status, period.  You have no honor or morals if you just stick your ex with the rent because your feelings are hurt that the relationship is over.\n\nYou allowed your mutual friends to come to an incorrect conclusion about the ex and didn\u2019t clarify when you KNOW they got it wrong, how are you not the ah, Seriously?!?  So, not only are you a crappy bf, but also have added shitty friend to your glowing resume.  Friend\u2019s don\u2019t lie to one another, or at least not anyone I\u2019d trust or respect to call a friend.\n\nAs to the actual breakup, I see how self centered you appear in a simple post, i can only imagine how difficult, harsh & inattentive you were prior to your diagnosis, live and in person for only your gf to experience.  Sounds like the best possible outcome for all, former gf is rid of you, your parent\u2019s can support you as you adjust to your diagnosis and hopefully you\u2019ll be ready to spread your adult wings and fly one day soon.  This was a great practice run, but you\u2019ve clearly still got some growing to do.\n\nYTA", "Yta", "YTA. You know she didn't break up with you bc you have lupus, it's a jerk and immature move to let your friends think that she did. Same for not paying her the money you owe her, just bc she broke up with you and you're mad at her.\n\nIt is with situations like this where people tend to show their integrity, and you are demonstrating that you have none.  You're entitled to feel upset and angry with her but not to engage in petty revenge to get back at her.  Smh. Karma is a B, how would you feel if you break up with a future GF and she did the same to you?", "YTA\n\nIf you were splitting rent and she offered to pay the other half until you could pay her back, yes you need to pay that back.\n\nIf the friends made the assumptions in your presence and you didn't correct them, you're double TA because you didn't correct them, but you definitely need to do so now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook, I've been in your situation before. It's a super crappy place to be, but that doesn't mean you can't bounce back. She doesn't seem like the most upstanding person anyway, if she's willing to leave just because you won't give her attention and knows you're struggling with what sounds like a small bout of depression. Pay her back ASAP, correct the friends' timelines, and show that you're the better person.", "YTA. I hope this shows up in some of those tik tok videos on your Friends fyp", ">I also was let go from my job and didn\u2019t have the energy to find another one.\n\nYTA \n\nSorry but if you were able to work before you should have found another job or got on some sort of financial assistance. Just because you \"didn't have the energy\" doesn't mean you get to burden other people and just swear off working all together. She probably broke up with you because she didn't want to provide for someone who refused to participate in household bills like an adult.\n\nSorry about your diagnosis but dragging your exes name through the mud and not paying her what she's owed is unacceptable.", "You sound just wonderful. YTA", "Lying by omission is till lying- YTA", "YTA\n\nSo you took her money and are now intentionally making people think your ex broke it off because you were sick, rather than the truth - that she couldnt deal with a miserable, emotionally absent partner relying on her financially and refusing to look for a new job, so she left.\n\nGive her back her money and stop lying by omission.", "YTA and I hope she sues you", "YTA.

I also was let go from my job and didn\u2019t have the energy to find another one. My gf broke up with me after our lease expired and demanded I pay her back for the 2 months rent I couldn\u2019t pay because I wasn\u2019t working. After she left I moved back with my parents. \n\nI don\u2019t think I treated her badly I just wasn\u2019t feeling great at the time. I had been going to doctors a lot for the last couple years. They could never find anything wrong with me. I was diagnosed with Arthritis previously. Finally I was referred to a specialist who did another blood test and found I was high in antibodies and diagnosed me with Lupus. I read about the symptoms and they fit better than Arthritis so I hope it\u2019s a definitive diagnoses. \n\nI was diagnosed less than month after she broke up with me and I told my friends about it. We share a lot of friends so when they asked why we broke up I said she just didn\u2019t like my attitude or something and they filled in the blanked and began accusing her of breaking up with me because of my diagnoses. She broke up with me before the diagnoses but I think she did break up with me because I wasn\u2019t feeling good and not giving her attention. \n\nShe texted me to tell me to tell our mutual friends she broke up before the diagnoses and I told her I didn\u2019t clarify the dates and they made their own assumptions. She accused me of intentionally ruining her friends and not paying her back for the rent I owe her. Why should I when she broke up with me? But AITA for not clarifying with my friends she broke up before the diagnoses and not paying her back for rent?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You chose not to clarify that she broke up with you before your diagnoses intentionally making it seem like something it wasnt.", "I relate to OP, having a chronic illness myself. Story time: I was dating someone and we went on a trip together. I'd been having strange symptoms and chronic pain for about a year before the trip. The first day of the trip I was incredibly tired. I couldn't shake it. My partner got angry with me because \"we didn't fly all the way \\[t\\]here to take naps in the hotel room.\" I really tried to force myself to get up and go do activities but it was hard. Long story short on that, I developed shingles on that trip and shortly after we returned I had a very big MS relapse that got me diagnosed.\n\nIn hindsight, the year of weird symptoms and the chronic pain (MS symptoms) as well as the intense fatigue at the onset of shingles (viral) made so much sense. I truly could not help it. At the time I felt so ashamed of myself. But once I had the chance to put the pieces together it made me angry that I was treated so poorly for something I truly could not help. She was supposed to be my partner who loved and supported me, not someone who treated me like I deserved to be poked with an electric rod when I'm not performing to her expectations. She should have seen that something was wrong because she knew that wasn't how I normally behaved, especially not on a long awaited trip I was excited for.\n\nBeing diagnosed was also a huge mindfuck. It took a lot of time and work to get to a place of acceptance. I can imagine that being out of work and feeling like shit yet not knowing why probably was a pretty big mindfuck for OP too. Getting dx'd with lupus was probably not easy. Given all of that I have a bit more empathy for OP not getting himself together and jumping up to get himself another job. He deserved compassion and empathy and patience since clearly even before this point he'd been seeing dr's and having symptoms affecting his health.\n\nAll that being said, turning her friends against her and using his illness as an excuse as to why he doesn't owe her money is crappy behavior. I think in light of the massive burden of dx, the struggle with managing symptoms and being unexpectedly unemployed give OP slightly more wiggle room to act in unexpected ways. However, OP needs to wake up and realize that his dx is his problem and no one elses. It shouldn't be used as an excuse for bad behavior. **OP, that's a weighty dx that I'm sorry you experienced but you need to clarify to the friends that she did not dump you for your dx, that you actually do owe her money and you need to take responsibility for paying her back that money.** She should have been nicer but that doesn't change any of those facts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nESH", "Oh my goodness, I was diagnosed with lupus 12 years ago.
