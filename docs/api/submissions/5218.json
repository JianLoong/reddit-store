Don't feel bad for setting reasonable boundaries. \n\nYou only have to be told this because you grew up this way, and it broke things inside you. Rest assured,  you are not the AH here.", "NTA, especially since she's leaving her 6 year old", "NTA.  She\u2019s using your place to escape her responsibilities.  Put her out.  There\u2019s not enough room for her.", "NTA.  It sounds like you need your personal space separate from your mother, and that's fine.  You told her, now make it happen.", "NTA\n\nShe's avoiding her responsibilities at your house. You had every right to call her out on that. I'm a little surprised her husband didn't do that earlier. If she wants to reconnect with you, you guys can meet up and do stuff together but she shouldn't be staying with you.", "NTA: Fact is that if there is no legal ties to her and YOUR place you can have her legally removed. I would approach this with caution though, as not to stir up drama. I would sit with her and simply state that she needs to be our by certain time frame or you will have her removed. Hold your ground, and do not let her bully you. Also I wouldn't mention the broken items. At least not yet. From the sounds of it, it's going to be problematic enough to get her out.", "Does she give a reason for staying at yours? That is very strange behaviour. NTA, but there is nothing inherently wrong with leaving her 6 year old with her husband. The reason she is the AH is because she's forcing herself on you when you don't want her round so often.", "NTA, she wouldn't respect your boundaries so you had no choice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's not normal behavior.", "NTA.  She should not be staying there at all.  It is a shared space and it is unfair to your housemates.

What does she do at your home when she's there?", "NTA. It's not like you kicked her out into the street.  She has her own spacious comfortable home that she can go to.   Going forward - maybe you could tell Mom that your housemates have asked that she not spend so much time there - and since they pay rent, they have a right to be comfortable in their own home.", "NTA.

She would not want to tell you about it because you're the kid and you should not have to deal with adult issues.  I know you are an adult, but from your mom's pov, you're still the kid.  Also it's not fair to dump her problems onto you.", "She just watches TV , eat and sleep mainly with sometimes sorting her (my) closet", "I don\u2019t find that could be true she has confided to me before about alcohol and addiction and bad relationships and she hasn\u2019t this time if she was genuinely worried she usually confides in me", "You shouldn\u2019t have to be her parent, OP.
