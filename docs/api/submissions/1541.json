Flight length is 7 hours.  The setup is 3-3-3, 3 seats on the sides, and 3 on the middle aisle.  Most people have their seats setup so it's x-o-x, 2 people in each row, with a space between them.  \n\nI get lucky and have a row all to myself o-o-x.  But i didnt want to take a chance to move so i put all my stuff in my seat pouch (tablet, water bottle, phone, earphones).  \n\nDuring takeoff I stay in my assigned seat, then when the seat belt light goes off I put on my earplugs and eyemask and lay down.  \n\nAbout 30 minutes in someone taps my leg, I wake up and reposition in the middle seat.  It was an old Asian woman that immediaately sat down in my original assigned seat when i got up. I thought she was sitting down to let people pass her by, but she stays there and starts putting her purse under the seat and water bottle in the seat pouch (my stuff is still inside).  \n\nShe gestures for me to move to the other seat. I'm just confused, and stare at her for a good minute thinking what is going on.  \n\nI call the help button. A crewmember comes and I explain that the woman is sitting in my assigned seat and the the other seats in the row were not occupied, so its obviously not her assigned seat, so I'm asking him to tell her to leave.  He says that since I moved seats she can too.  Visible confusion just radiates from my eyes.  At this time she didn't say anything to this crewmember.  \n\nShe gestures for me to move over to the other aisle seat again so it's x-o-x, but I tell her no. So I decide to just play hardball and get my tablet from her seat and start watching movies.  Another 20-30 minutes go by and they start serving drinks.  She gets a drink and starts having a long conversation to a different crewmember.   \n\nIdk what they said, but she chugged her drink, took her stuff (I was watching if she was trying to steal something) and left. Never saw her again. She wasn't even in the vicinity when I went to the bathroom, no idea where she came from.  \n\nWhen she left I laid down and went to sleep.  So AITA for not moving over to share the row with this woman?\n\nEdit:  \n\n1) I described her as old Asian lady trying to describe  a language and cultural barrier. I'll describe myself as young Asian-american man that doesn't speak their language.  \n\n2) The flight seemed about 60-70% full. Like I said most rows were x-o-x, but some people had rows to themselves like me.  I don't know what the lady's seat was since I didn't see her in the vicinity and didn't see her again.  I didn't see any rows near me that were full x-x-x.    \n\n3) I laid down on the row. Someone tapped my leg, I got up because I thought it was crew telling me to put on my seat belt. It just happened that when I sat up I ended up in the middle seat. Before I had the chance to say or do anything the lady took my seat without saying anything. I did not willingly move to the middle seat. I just sat up and she took it, so even if I wanted to move to my assigned seat, I couldn't because she was there.", "created_utc": 1667647808, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymrcwz/aita_for_complaining_about_an_old_lady_that_took/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This AITA isn't about whether lying across three seats is respectable behavior on a flight (imo it's fine).\n\nWhen you sat up, naturally you rotated upwards into the middle seat, but your original seat was still yours. Just as it'd be wrong for her to take it while you were in the bathroom, it's wrong for her to take it here.\n\nIf someone wanted to take one of these seats because they were in a row of three people, it'd be reasonable for them to take the farthest seat from yours in that row, so that it remains x-o-x. You can't lay claim to more than one seat if someone wants one. But you can lay claim to the seat you booked and never actually left.\n\nIf she wanted an aisle seat with nobody beside her, why didn't she take the seat she was gesturing for you to take?! Why should she get three seats to herself instead of you? She could have taken that other aisle seat for herself. You clearly didn't have the only available seats on the place.
