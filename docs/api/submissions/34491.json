In the interim we uprooted our lives to move to the middle of nowhere from a coastal town to help MIL raise my Husband's niece [11 F] due to his sister being unfit. We never wanted kids but it's family so here we are... We have been here for the past 4 years and have been crucial in her development [I.E. the kid had never been to school and SOO much more] and at this point we're considered 'Mom and Dad' but this blanket has been a point of contention. It's a basic Walmart blanket that has a bandaid stuck to it, when I asked MIL about it she said the bandaid was from when SIL was in her home and injecting and wants me to get rid of it as well. My husband had agreed but I just found it in our closet. I put it on top of the garbage pile and he lost his mind! He is saying it's the last connection to his sister, which in my mind is horrible because of everything we have had to deal with. I get it's hard to lose a sibling but YUCK! A nasty bandaid left by a junkie is not something I want in my home \ud83e\udd22 He says it's ok because he washed it but I don't want any reminders of this terrible woman, especially in the form of a friggin bandaid! AITA?\n\nUPDATE!! It's not a family blanket! It's a $10 zebra throw from Walmart that my MIL got for her daughter when she was living in her car, then she wrapped herself in it after almost ODing in my MIL's bathroom and left the bandaid that was covering her track marks on the damn blanket!\n\nMy niece knows NOTHING about it!\n\nThis \"woman\" left her child with men to be violated. This child had NEVER been to school at SEVEN when we got custody of her. We wish it had been sooner hence the reason I mentioned from the coast to the middle of nowhere \ud83d\ude11 She had scabies, cigarette burns, and a whole lot more of issues. \n\nMy MIL hates the stupid little \"blanket\" and my husband thinks it's gross that his [in his words] sister's germs are on it but he's sentimental. He has plenty of pictures and other momento's of when she was good and sober. I don't understand the want of something she literally vomited into while telling his mother to go fuck herself and getting dragged out in front of her kid but hey maybe I'm crazy \ud83d\ude12", "created_utc": 1704585256, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190e1lx/aita_for_throwing_away_my_husbands_sisters_blanket/", "score": 395, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Throw the damn blanket and bandaid away. This is ridiculous and childish. Commenters are treating OP like a villain for being enraged over how badly mistreated this child was. You don't need therapy for being justifiably angry and disgusted by the mistreatment of a kid. This should be the normal response?? It is not okay to abuse or neglect children in any way, shape or form, and you should be LIVID if you find out it is happening. WHY is there an argument about this???? OP is perfectly in their rights and right mind to despise the kind of person that could treat their child like this. And this weird obsession with a fricking bandaid/blanket/whatever? Is unhealthy. This is not grieving. It is unhealthy, it is unrational. Yes, it was his sister, yes, he can grieve, but clinging on to a damn bandaid is not healthy grieving. OP stated that he has pictures, videos, etc. It's not like this is the last scrap of a dead woman that he will never see ever again. Get him therapy if it's such an issue and throw the disgusting thing out. It is fricking wild that there is so many people here defending this. What the hell is going on in your minds? Also, way to encourage him to teach the niece weird and bad coping mechanisms. OP and MIL know what they're doing, ya'll need to get a grip and leave OP alone.", "I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s wrong with the comments. The sister is not dead. OP\u2019s husband isn\u2019t grieving. The sister pimped her child out and severely neglected her daughter, who in their right mind wants to keep a memento of an abuser\u2019s OD blanket. The blanket doesn\u2019t belong to OP\u2019s husband, it belongs to the mom who lent it to the sister. Mom wants the blanket gone. There are still photo\u2019s of the sister and other mementos of her for the husband and the niece. It isn\u2019t healthy to keep this blanket. If the sister came back sober, I doubt it would be healthy for the sister to see her OD blanket. OP should absolutely get rid of the blanket.", "These comments are sickening and insane. Absolutely NTA. This woman allowed her child to be RAPED. In addition to that she abused and neglected her child to the extreme. This blanket seems to be a symbol of why this girl ended up the way she did. There\u2019s no reason why you need to keep it. Get rid of it. You don\u2019t want your niece stumbling upon reminders of her past abuse and/or finding it and wondering why the people who are supposed to be her parents would want to keep something directly related to her abuse. Not sure if what you said about your niece knowing nothing of the blanket means she doesn\u2019t know about the conflict surrounding it or has never seen it before. Regardless, if you keep it and hide it, she will likely find it. Your husband should be prepared to explain it to her. You should all be prepared for any memento of her mother to be triggering for her as she gets older, let alone a disgusting Walmart blanket that\u2019s a symbol of the abuse she endured.", ">*He is saying it's the last connection to his sister*\n\nNah her daughter is. Quietly get rid of the blanket if you haven't already. **NTA**", "INFO: can you clarify the specific issue?  Did you throw out the blanket with the bandaid on it or just the bandaid?  Does he want to keep the blanket, the bandaid or both?", "NTA, everyone keeps saying that it's up to you husband, but it's not.  Your MIL bought that blanket, it was in her house, and she wants to gone, so it should be thrown away.  Her opinion is honestly the only one that matters since it was purchased by HER and left in HER HOUSE.", "NTA. Your husband needs THERAPY. His sister allowed unspeakable things to happen to her daughter. Her name should never even be thought of again. At the most that blanket could be put in a storage bin but it should be burned just like her memory.", "NTA for being grossed out.\n\nBut can't you just put the blanket in a box and put it away?", "I'm definitely in the minority and I'm definitely getting downvoted, but NTA. Your niece is not attached to it, it holds no sentimental value for her, same with your MIL. Your husband doesn't have any other piece to remind him of his sister? Her photos maybe. Why a blanket that represents the worst of the woman?", "NTA! Your niece is a better, living, and growing part (the good part) of your SIL. If your husband is so attached to the blanket, could you do the security blanket thing? That would be cutting a piece of it and storing it in a sandwich bag.", "You see a horrible blanket left by the person who made you uproot and change your whole life. He sees the last thing his sister touched. Don\u2019t make him get rid of it. Perhaps ask him to keep it somewhere you don\u2019t have to see it on a regular basis. And please if you\u2019re not already in counseling, consider it. It\u2019s good to have a place to let out your feelings with someone that\u2019s not invested in the situation.", "I would say NTA. Yes, she is his sister, but she is also the Person who abandoned the girl you are raising and let her get raped. The people who say you sound bitter because you called her a junkie are maybe missing the part where she is a child sex trafficker.", "Can't you get rid of the bandaid and wash the blanket intensely? There has to be a compromise here somewhere.\n\nEDIT: Since I asked - you've changed around from saying that the blankets been cleaned and yall tried to remove the bandaid to saying it's about DNA about the bandaid. You refuse to even seek to compromise on this and care nothing for your families sentimentality.\n\nYou just want to make excuses after excuses. So YTA.", "NAH\n\nYea, I know \ud83d\ude14 I'll probably be downvoted to the earth's core for it, but that's my vote. *(And this comment is long af with no tl:dr, sorry.)*\n\nI agree with those who said this isn't really about a blanket or a band-aid. I also agree with those saying OP is full of anger, resentment, and bitterness. But I think OP is feeling those things so strongly *because* she has become \"Mom\" to this little girl, and parenthood no matter how it happened tends to make you feel pretty fiercely protective of the one(s) you're parenting. Idk, maybe it's because I've been in a reasonably similar position to OP. But I feel like a lot of this rage she can barely contain could have a lot to do with feeling that protective \"mama bear\" wave rush in whenever she thinks of the horrible things this poor child was subjected to at the hands of the girl's biological mother. If that's the case, I really can not condemn OP for feeling this way. We are supposed to hate the disease and not the person, but it can be pretty fucking hard sometimes, especially if the person has done incredibly heinous things while in active addiction. No one is great at controlling their emotions 100% of the time, and OP's rage over the walmart zebra blanket (which is not really about the blanket imo) could very well just be the drop in the currently-full bucket that caused it to overflow onto reddit. \n\nI do think it's bizarre that OP's husband wants to keep the band-aid/blanket (and I can confirm that a band-aid *can* get permastuck to a blanket, esp after repeated machine washing and drying melts the adhesive into the fibers of the fabric and they harden into one entity). But trauma and grief make humans do weird shit that under other circumstances we would ask, \"What the fuck??\" if we saw someone else doing it. Everyone in this situation has experienced its inherent trauma, and each [adult] person needs to do what they need to do in order to deal with it while being respectful to the others' needs.\n\nOP, keeping this band-aid/blanket is clearly something your husband needs to do for the time being in order to cope, so completely tossing it right now is not an option. Your need to never lay eyes on it again is also valid. I think the suggestions to pare the blanket down to its smallest acceptable-to-your-husband size and put it out of sight in some kind of bag or container are really good ones. He will be the one to let it go if/when *he* feels ready to, and you never have to see it again. You will be the one to let go of the intense hatred of your SIL if/when *you* feel ready. A lot of people with ties to addicts/alcoholics would very much understand the fury you feel right now toward this woman. Have you tried any support groups? Semi-unsolicited advice here, but it sounds like you all still need some really intensive therapy, individually and together. I'm very sorry for the shitty situation in which SIL's addiction has landed the family. What you two have done for his niece is really admirable, and I'm so glad for her sake that you are able to do it.", "NTA, that woman sounds horrible, and your husband is being irrational. If he really must keep it, he should keep it in the basement, attic, whatever. \n\nYou uprooted your entire life to care for this kid who has been through hell, and people still want to claim you lack empathy. It's ridiculous. You did what the vast majority of people would never do. But apparently, getting rid of a nasty blanket is crossing a line smh.", "I'm so confused why everyone's mad at you for speaking badly of his sister....a literal sex offender/child sex trafficker... Idc WHOS sister she is that's disgusting?? Like should we excuse the behaviors of criminals because they are related to us? NAH except the horrible excuse of a \"mother\"", "Imma go against the grain, NTA\n\nIt's freaking wild everyone is calling you an AH for wanting to get rid of something no one wants. I would still toss it. The fact the niece has no love for it, was abused by her and no one has love for the junkie.", "OP, your inability to take criticism will only lead you towards further unhappiness. May you walk a better path. You are hurting the people around you.", "I don\u2019t really get everyone saying YTA. I\u2019d hate that woman too if I were you and I totally get you not wanting to look at that blanket. That being said, put it in a box somewhere and let your husband let it go when he is ready. Kudos to you for all the compromising you did and for raising the kid up out of what would\u2019ve been a shit life. Reddit people are weird. You\u2019re NTA.", "Originally I was going to say N TA, but having read the replies you\u2019ve posted and the justifications others have provided\u2026 I now firmly believe YTA.\n\nYou really don\u2019t get it. Just because you hate the blanket doesn\u2019t change the fact that your husband wants to keep it. Is it ridiculous because it\u2019s kinda nasty? Yes. Does that give you the right to throw it out? No.\n\nThe bottom line is he wants it, and you should respect that.", "NTA\n\nI completely understand not wanting reminders of a child abuser around. OP is doing a lot for this man and his family. He can get therapy, get rid of the blanket and drop the fucking attitude with her.", "After reading all the responses (and) your reply\u2019s, it\u2019s obvious that no matter how anyone tries to explain the significance of the throw/bandaid is to your husband - your not hearing it! How about doing this, tell your husband to put it in a bag and then YOU forget about it instead of causing all the drama.", "YTA - I get that your SIL did awful things in the depths of her addiction.  I get it isn't a homemade heirloom item.  \n\nYour husband is mourning the sister he had *BEFORE* her addiction and, for whatever reason, has formed an emotional connection to this blanket.  Your emotional connection to the blanket is anger, so you want it gone.  His is grief so he is clinging to it.  Put it in a clear bin so he can see it and leave it alone.", "Your husband should find a support group for family of addicts. You should seek therapy.\n\nYou both should agree to have the blanket custom made by a professional into a stuffed animal for the kid.\n\nYou don't get to decide who's feelings are valid. YTA\n\nYour feelings are also valid, but you are misplacing your rage.", "In the minority but NAH except the child\u2019s mom. I don\u2019t understand why your husband wants to hold on to this reminder of his sister but since he does put it in a plastic container and put it in the attic or basement. Then it is out of your sight and he gets to keep the strange reminder. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t want it in my house but really it is not worth this battle. \nI hope the child is able to heal from her traumatic past and thrive under better circumstances. Hurts my heart to think of what she has endured.", "The blanket does not belong to you. It is not causing you any harm.\n\nThe memories it invokes for your brother are of better times and obviously bring him some joy. Why does this cause you such discomfort? \n\nYWBTA if you threw it away. \n\nIf you don't like to look at it, put it somewhere out of your sight.", "Your both raising his sister's child and he's stuck on a nasty blanket? He might need some grief counseling.", "NTA, burn that shit! Plan A: Tell your husband it is a reminder of the person that severely abused your niece and it will not stay in your home. Plan B: Burn that shit and buy the same zebra blanket. Wash the zebra blanket and tell your husband the band aid came off in the wash. Any questions about the blanket looking different, the blanket looks better b/c you do laundry better than him.", "Just put it in a giant ziplock and bury it in the back of the closet, tell your husband where it is and then forget it.", "YTA\u2026 it\u2019s not just the blanket you resent is it?  Your post absolutely reeks of the sacrifice YOU have had to make for HIS family.  Are you looking for an award? Pity? An \u201coh aren\u2019t you wonderful\u201d?  Anyone with an ounce of empathy could\u2019ve seen what the consequences of your actions were going to be.", "NAH. You are understandably angry at your SIL for her criminal behavior toward a child. You resent what she did to your niece and, possibly, what she effectively did to the whole family, including uprooting your life and plans and generally causing pain all around. Any memento of her horrible behavior is repulsive.  \nYour husband's not on the same page. For whatever reason, he doesn't want to let go of something that he has assigned significance to. He's made that bandaid a symbol of the sister he had before addiction changed her. It's gross, it doesn't make sense, but -- here's the problem -- it doesn't have to make sense. This is where his brain has gone, so that defines your choices: \n1. You can ask him to show love to you by valuing your disgust more than his attachment. He tosses the item.\n2. You can show him love by valuing his attachment more than your repulsion. You stash the item and deal with it.\n\nThat's where you're at. Your call on how to play it.\n\nJust to note: he's lost a sister, essentially, and you've lost your freedom and child-free future - you're both grieving and angry. I'd really recommend talking this over with a pro before you two misplace your grief and anger and become resentful of each other.", "NAH \nHaving a family member who is sick with addiction and is likely going to die from this sickness is a really complex trauma. \nIt might not even be that the blanket is about sympathy but is a tangible reminder or motivation. \n\nSometimes trauma manifests in different ways for different people. \nIf this the only thing your husband is holding on to (for his own reasons) and the sight of it is upsetting to you and to his mother, I suggest a compromise where the blanket is folded up and contained in a clear plastic bag (like a ziplock or garment bag) and he can keep it somewhere with his things out of site. \n\nThere are a lot of reasons he might be holding on to it, all of those reasons are as real and emotionally visceral as your disgust towards it. \n\nCompromise first, don\u2019t push him to throw it away, do create boundaries so you and your MiL don\u2019t have to see or touch it. \n\nIf your family isn\u2019t already doing so, individual therapy for you and your husband would probably be helpful.\n\nGrief and the ways we process grief aren\u2019t always logical and losing someone so completely to addiction is a source of complicated grief so take a step back and see that blanket as your husband\u2019s way of dealing with that particular grief, and it is different from the way you are processing it but that is neither of you are wrong.\n\nI\u2019m glad your niece has the both of you", "Yta he put it away it\u2019s not hurting anyone I get being grossed out but it\u2019s sentimental", "As an adult child of drug abusers and having gone through a lot I never should have THANK YOU FOR TAKING CARE OF THAT BABY AND SET THAT NASTY THING ON FIRE!!!!

We have been here for the past 4 years and have been crucial in her development [I.E. the kid had never been to school and SOO much more] and at this point we're considered 'Mom and Dad' but this blanket has been a point of contention. It's a basic Walmart blanket that has a bandaid stuck to it, when I asked MIL about it she said the bandaid was from when SIL was in her home and injecting and wants me to get rid of it as well. My husband had agreed but I just found it in our closet. I put it on top of the garbage pile and he lost his mind! He is saying it's the last connection to his sister, which in my mind is horrible because of everything we have had to deal with. I get it's hard to lose a sibling but YUCK! A nasty bandaid left by a junkie is not something I want in my home \ud83e\udd22 He says it's ok because he washed it but I don't want any reminders of this terrible woman, especially in the form of a friggin bandaid!
