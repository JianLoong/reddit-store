She shouldn\u2019t have made that comment or given you a hard time, but it would be common courtesy to give up your seat. It sounds like you usually would have, so willing to give a pass - but navigating public transportation with a double stroller is tough. Elevators are often broken, getting through the turnstiles, balancing on the train with it and the kids. when i had my twin babies and a huge stroller, I would occasionally get eye rolls and comments for my big stroller - but that was what I needed to exist in a public space. I know AITA is generally upset at what they view as parental entitlement, but there\u2019s something to having awareness that someone else\u2019s walk through life (or ride on the subway) is more difficult than yours at that exact moment, and you have the power to make it a bit easier. I never ask for the seat or the help opening the door or someone to switch tables to give us more space - but when someone offers, it\u2019s a bit a sunshine and relief that is so greatly appreciated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm going with light NTA here, because I do think it's weird that OP's seat was singled out. Why their seat and not someone else's? \nBut the way OP worded this story just... really rubbed me the wrong way. The stroller price was absolutely unnecessary, as was the whole \"surprise, surprise\" bit.  Like... okay. Was that supposed to be funny? What point are you trying to make? OP's tone in this post just makes it seem like they had already decided they were NTA and in that case, why come to Reddit?\nIt's fine that OP didn't give up their seat because they were tired. That's why I'm light NTA. If they would have been perfectly fine standing, I would've said differently. \nHowever, regardless of Reddit's judgement here (which also appears to be NTA), OP definitely looked like TA to the family. This is where that whole critique of this subreddit focusing on what people are and aren't legally obligated to do comes in. Of course OP was not obligated to give up their seat, but to the people watching and especially to the family, it would have been a nice thing to do. \nI'm still NTA (weakly), just trying to be realistic here though.", "Yep. Different but similar thing happened to me. I was on the train to get to the airport on the west coast and I was waiting by the doors with my suitcase. Before I could get off, a family with a stroller rushed on and I missed my stop. I told him it\u2019s courtesy to wait for people to get off first but he didn\u2019t seem to care. I\u2019m a mom now and I never try to inconvenience others just because I have my kid with me."]}
