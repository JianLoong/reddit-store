He is the light of my life, and both my husband (M30) and I are overjoyed.\n\nMy mom (F61) lives overseas and came to help out with the new baby. She is a doting grandma, but tends to do things her way so there have been a few hiccups.\n\nThe paediatrician was very clear that NO ONE should kiss the baby other than my husband and I. The baby's little immune system is too weak, and God forbid he gets something. I was very clear about this to my mom, who was resistant but I was firm and told her no holdinb the baby at all unless she agrees to no kissing. So, no kissing was agreed.\n\nYesterday, I walked into the nursery to find my mom kissing the baby and generally playing with him. I was so upset, how long had she been doing this behind my back?! My mom justified it by saying that the baby was now two weeks old and nothing bad had happened, so we could start building his immune system. She also said rules like these were why so many children had allergies nowadays.\n\nI took the baby from my mom and called her a selfish cow. I told her that when the baby d*es from a preventable disease, it will be her fault and hers alone (I may have gone a bit far). I told her she was lucky I wasn't kicking her out, and the only reason I wasn't is because she has no place else to go. \n\nAs I type this my mom is busy packing her bags because she is \"clearly not welcome in [her] grandchild's life\", and moaning about how she will never have a bond with him.\n\nShe found time in all of this to text my aunt (F65), who called to tell me that I should be ashamed of myself and that my son should count his blessings that he has a loving grandmother. Now I wonder if I was a bit intense, and probably could have been a bit more relaxed.

Herpesviruses are suggested to be a cause or contributor to autoimmune diseases with CNS components (MS, lupus, etc.), as these viruses easily infect neural tissues. As these viral infections can be permanent, a dormant past infection can also reactivate later on, triggering various complications, including an aggressive type of encephalitis that can appear when a patient is immunosuppressed (due to treatment for an autoimmune disease or cancer, for instance).\n\nThe current public perception that herpesviruses are harmless is actually a serious problem, and a threat to general public health.\n\nAutoimmune lit review link: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6723519/", "My grandmother had one of her babies die from herpes because someone kissed the baby.

This infection can be very serious; primarily when the baby contracts HSV-2 and it is systemic, meaning that it affects the entire body. In most cases, when newborns exhibit symptoms it is almost always followed by an infection. *The severity of the infection is significantly heightened in newborns because their immune system is not fully developed and as a result, the virus can enter the brain and spinal fluid much easier and when it does, it can result in serious complications.*\n\n> Newborns that are infected at first may exhibit only mild symptoms, such as a low grade fever, poor feeding, or a few small skin blisters. These symptoms can occur anywhere from 2-12 days after transmission of the virus. For some infants, these symptoms will remain mild, but for others with a systemic infection, things can escalate very quickly. In these more severe cases, the fever may become high, the baby may experience seizures, lethargy may kick in where the baby becomes floppy, and eye inflammation, blindness, and respiratory illnesses could occur.\n\nThe baby's vital organs can also be affected such as the lungs, kidneys, liver and central nervous system. When the liver becomes affected, the baby will likely become jaundiced while when the central nervous system is affected, seizures, shock, and hypothermia could occur. In the most severe cases, HSV-2 can cause encephalitis which causes the brain to become inflamed and often results in brain damage. If you think your baby is experiencing any of these symptoms, mild or severe, it is very important to contact a physician immediately to have your baby examined.\n\nSo given how many adults have HSV and are asymptomatic carriers, and how easy it is to shed the virus and *not know* that you are shedding... Grandma is **absolutely** the asshole for not doing as directed and allowing her selfishness to supersede the doctor *and* the parents. \n\nDon't fucking kiss babies."]}
