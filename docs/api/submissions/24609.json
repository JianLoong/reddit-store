He is the light of my life, and both my husband (M30) and I are overjoyed.\n\nMy mom (F61) lives overseas and came to help out with the new baby. She is a doting grandma, but tends to do things her way so there have been a few hiccups.\n\nThe paediatrician was very clear that NO ONE should kiss the baby other than my husband and I. The baby's little immune system is too weak, and God forbid he gets something. I was very clear about this to my mom, who was resistant but I was firm and told her no holdinb the baby at all unless she agrees to no kissing. So, no kissing was agreed.\n\nYesterday, I walked into the nursery to find my mom kissing the baby and generally playing with him. I was so upset, how long had she been doing this behind my back?! My mom justified it by saying that the baby was now two weeks old and nothing bad had happened, so we could start building his immune system. She also said rules like these were why so many children had allergies nowadays.\n\nI took the baby from my mom and called her a selfish cow. I told her that when the baby d*es from a preventable disease, it will be her fault and hers alone (I may have gone a bit far). I told her she was lucky I wasn't kicking her out, and the only reason I wasn't is because she has no place else to go. \n\nAs I type this my mom is busy packing her bags because she is \"clearly not welcome in [her] grandchild's life\", and moaning about how she will never have a bond with him.\n\nShe found time in all of this to text my aunt (F65), who called to tell me that I should be ashamed of myself and that my son should count his blessings that he has a loving grandmother. Now I wonder if I was a bit intense, and probably could have been a bit more relaxed.

What are the dangers of kissing babies? Is it really that important? Yes, it truly is. Here\u2019s what you need to know about kissing babies and how to properly take precautions to protect your little ones from harm. \n\nThe Risks of Kissing Babies\nA parent or family member\u2019s love and affection is a vital part of each and every child\u2019s development. However, failing to take precautions can be seriously harmful to an infant. Here are some of the problems that kissing an infant can cause:\n\nRSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus)\nRSV is a very serious and potentially fatal condition that can be passed through physical contact or through the passing of infected respiratory droplets via a cough or sneeze. Even if you aren\u2019t feeling under the weather, if you\u2019ve recently had a cold or sinus infection, it\u2019s absolutely essential not to hold, touch, and especially kiss a newborn or infant. RSV can cause severe breathing problems and can also affect the heart and brain.\n\nImmune System Vulnerability\nNewborns are born with developing immune systems that have to work hard to keep their tiny bodies from fighting off disease and infection. Within the first few months of life, babies are at their most vulnerable stage. Though the soft and fluffy cheeks may be tempting, remember to pause and think about the risks of kissing the infant when you consider that the germs you are spreading are foreign invaders which can put up a fight against his or her little body. \n\nAllergic Reactions\nBelieve it or not, a kiss from someone with food particles or skin-care products can cause or irritate food allergies in a newborn. Whether it\u2019s just chapstick or moisturizer, some ingredients could be harmful to your newborn. Skincare products can also cause exposure to seriously harmful chemicals. It\u2019s also of great importance to remember that if an individual has recently consumed nuts, dairy, soy, or other foods that can be the cause of common food allergies, your newborn may be exposed to a substance which you are unaware he or she may be allergic to.\n\nHand, Foot, and Mouth Disease\nHand, foot, and mouth disease is common, but there are ways to prevent your child from getting it or spreading the disease to others. Hand, foot, and mouth is a virus that causes ulcers and rashes around the mouth, hands, feet, and leg area. Though anyone can catch hand, foot, and mouth disease, it\u2019s more common in children under the age of ten. While it\u2019s not typically life-threatening, it can cause problems in infants with weaker immune systems, and older siblings who contract the virus may have to miss school for an indefinite period of time. \n\nFever Blisters\nOne of the most serious risks that come from kissing babies is the transfer of fever blisters, also known as cold sores. HSV 1 causes fever blisters to form around the baby\u2019s mouth and can spread to other areas of the body, even their brain. Cold sores are very common in many individuals, so everyone should be aware before they go to kiss a baby. For some, this can cause long-term or fatal damage.", "My baby did almost die. Of RSV. Which she likely wouldn\u2019t have gotten if she wasn\u2019t being kissed on by every family member who picked her up. You are absolutely NTA. The only thing worse than sleeping in the hospital wondering if your baby is going to live through the night is going home without your baby because they didn\u2019t.", "Nope. My mom was so upset that my sister instituted boundaries with my niece. But complied because she knows my sister isn't fucking around.

Undeniably AH behaviour.\n\nYou were furious. I get it. I would\u2019ve been too. If it had stopped at selfish cow, I\u2019d be saying N T A. But you went to blaming her \u2018and her alone\u2019 for the hypothetical death of your baby. So yeah, you get AH points too. But far fewer of them, and with parent-of-a-newborn-levels-of-exhaustion as an extra mitigating factor.\n\nThen your mom gets extra AH points for moaning about \u2018never having a bond\u2019 with a baby she had the green light to cuddle to her heart\u2019s content.\n\nTo sum up, your mom won the AH Olympics, but you were beside her on the podium.

We then heard for months about how awful we were for \u201cthinking grandma would ever hurt the baby\u2026\u201d Well, if grandma thanks holding the baby RIGHTNOW is more important than it not getting the virus, idk, maybe she would? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOne of the suckiest things nobody talks about with having kids is growing up viewing people one way (smart, responsible, unselfish, and usually because we\u2019d been told that our whole life by them or others) and then being forced to see them through a new lens of reality because you are the person responsible for your kid\u2019s ultimate wellbeing vs the emotional comfort of grown ass relatives. Hold your boundaries, or they will continue to mow over them. There really are people out there that will go on day and night about how they\u2019d \u201cdie for their kids\u201d when in actuality, they\u2019d let their kids die to not ruffle grandma\u2019s feathers or cause a fuss or god forbid, ever make an elder feel disrespected.

This infection can be very serious; primarily when the baby contracts HSV-2 and it is systemic, meaning that it affects the entire body. In most cases, when newborns exhibit symptoms it is almost always followed by an infection. *The severity of the infection is significantly heightened in newborns because their immune system is not fully developed and as a result, the virus can enter the brain and spinal fluid much easier and when it does, it can result in serious complications.*\n\n> Newborns that are infected at first may exhibit only mild symptoms, such as a low grade fever, poor feeding, or a few small skin blisters. These symptoms can occur anywhere from 2-12 days after transmission of the virus. For some infants, these symptoms will remain mild, but for others with a systemic infection, things can escalate very quickly. In these more severe cases, the fever may become high, the baby may experience seizures, lethargy may kick in where the baby becomes floppy, and eye inflammation, blindness, and respiratory illnesses could occur.\n\nThe baby's vital organs can also be affected such as the lungs, kidneys, liver and central nervous system. When the liver becomes affected, the baby will likely become jaundiced while when the central nervous system is affected, seizures, shock, and hypothermia could occur. In the most severe cases, HSV-2 can cause encephalitis which causes the brain to become inflamed and often results in brain damage. If you think your baby is experiencing any of these symptoms, mild or severe, it is very important to contact a physician immediately to have your baby examined.\n\nSo given how many adults have HSV and are asymptomatic carriers, and how easy it is to shed the virus and *not know* that you are shedding...

A newborn baby has next to 0 immunity anyway, but one who has absolutely none, not even the immunity they should have gotten from mother, is absolutely at risk from even the smallest thing. Not to mention, even in a healthy baby, there are some illnesses and viruses that can indeed be passed in through a kiss or coughing that can wreck them. Consider this: whenever we get infected with a new sickness, our bloodstream carries the bacteria or virus into our lymphatic system, which is why our lymph nodes swell when unwell, and basically dissect the illness there in order to figure out how to combat it. One lymph node is in the neck, very close to our brain. If unable to properly handle the sickness, it\u2019s now in a position where something deadly serious can very quickly end up in or around the brain, lungs, or heart from its position within the lymphatic system. This means that it\u2019s not just a race against the clock that can take weeks or days like it might take with an adult, but hours. That\u2019s because the viral load needed to overwhelm an adults system is much larger than what is needed to overwhelm a newborns. Not to mention, an adult who is sick is sick with a stronger strain. For example: whenever I babysat my nephews and niece, I\u2019d usually come home poorly because two are in nursery and one is in primary school, and either set normally has a belly bug going around. I always end up picking up one or the other, and both strains are always weaker compared to what you pick up from an adult. While my nephews might be out poorly for a few days from the runs, I have them for one day and then is better. Why? Because my immune system is stronger, and they infected me with the weaker virus.

However, doctors are not gods. Most of what they say are very strict rules that are sometimes randomly set to minimize issues. Why are mom and Dad allowed to kiss the baby? Why not only mom? Why not only dad? Why not only mom and grandma? Because it's easy for the doctor to set the line there and set a rule that some people that don't have common sense follow blindly (like you OP). You're situation is different from most people because your mother lives with you and is exposed to the exact same things as you... it's OK for her to be kissing the baby, everything will be OK. With that said, it's fine for you to decide decisions that aren't rational regarding your  baby and your mother should have respected your boundaries. It was not OK of her to kiss him against your will... but to go as far as to calling her a selfish cow?! To blame her for the potential death of your child?!
