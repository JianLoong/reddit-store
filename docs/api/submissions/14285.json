I am simply not an individual who wants to focus on what a dog is doing all the time. I don't think that everything a dog does is cute or funny. I respect that some people are definitely the complete opposite and I never give people a hard time about it. I am simply just not that person. My husband IS that person though. We have a dog (2yo corgi mix) and absolutely everything she does is just down right adorable/hilarious to my husband. Even her laying normal and looking out the window is something he will start laughing over and telling me to stop what I'm doing to watch her. It doesn't matter what I'm doing honestly, he truly doesn't care. Reading a book, writing, drawing, cooking, doing the dishes, mopping, taking the garbage out, laundry, working, etc. He will 100% say \"babe come look at the dog, quick\" and she will quite literally not be doing anything at all but sitting there. I don't see the amusement. I don't see it as adorable. Maybe I'm broken, who knows. I love the dog. I simply just don't think everything she does warrants my complete undivided attention. I've tried explaining this to him so many times that I'm honestly just ridiculously tired of having the repeated conversation. He continues to ask me to stop what I'm doing to watch her while he's laughing hysterically regardless of these conversations. It's becoming quite exhausting, to be honest. \n\nSo I was on the porch in my hammock and reading my book. He comes out per usual and said \"babe, quick come look at the doggo\". I will admit that even hearing this kind of set me off because I'm trying to read and I know for a fact she was probably doing nothing. I go in anyways and I was correct. She wasn't doing anything. So I just kind of dead pan my husband and say \"what exactly is she doing that I had to stop reading for?\" He says something about how she was covering her face or something and it was funny but she apparently stopped. So I said \"okay well I'm reading now so..\" and I walk back outside. Not even 15 minutes later he comes back out and says \"quick, hurry, she's doing it again\". I honestly didn't even say anything to him. I just put my shoes on, grabbed my keys and left. I'm currently sitting at the park, reading my book. Or I was trying, but now I'm conflicted because he texted me saying that I have made him feel like shit for trying to share his joy with me and that he doesn't understand why I can't even pretend to be amused for his sake. A part of me knows he's right because I mean.. I could at least pretend to find it amusing like he does but it's so frequent at this point and like.. I am tired of being interrupted in general to watch a dog do absolutely nothing. I'm tired of feeling like my life has to be revolved around a dog doing nothing and I don't want to mentally strain myself pretending I understand the hype.

Tell him you are happy that he is all over that dog, but you don't have the same amount of enthusiasm. It's perfectly okay. If it makes him angry, you can counter that you don't run to him and force him to read a part of the book you really enjoyed.", "You have expressed your feelings to your husband yet he continues to ignore your request for him to stop.

I have three dogs and find the silliest things adorable, but I wouldn't expect anyone else to feel the same, especially after they have shared that they don't. You can love your dogsdogdogdogsdogdog and not be enamored by their every behavior. If it is bothering you enough that you had to leave from frustration it has gone way past him \"sharing his joy\". He needs to pay attention! I wish you luck, NTA!", "NTA, he needs to give you space to relax, and easily could just take a picture or send you a video  if the dog is doing something cute he wants to share.  Maybe he could start an instagram page for the dog, so he has sn outlet for sharing that doesn\u2019t involve bothering you.", "NTA. He cares nothing about your boundaries or about what brings YOU joy. To him, his desire to \u201cshare his joy\u201d with you far outweighs your boundaries or feelings. \n>\nThe fact that he literally wants you to *pretend to be amused for his sake* is an enormous red flag. He\u2019s literally telling you that he does not care how you really feel as long as you are faking it, for HIS sake and happiness.\n\nHonestly this entitled attitude would be a dealbreaker for me.

I have 5 dogs, and sometimes they do really dumb or funny things. I'll laugh at it, but if they are just sitting doing nothing, then why laugh.

I understand him wanting to share his joy with you, but that can become excessive after a while. You just aren\u2019t into the dog as much as he is, and this is fine. You have tried to talk to him and set a reasonable boundary, and he has showed you no respect by ignoring you entirely.

But I came to realize that I think everything they do is adorable and it\u2019s ridiculous to interrupt my partner every 5 seconds. You\u2019ve brought this up to him before so he didn\u2019t even need to have the self realization that I had because someone else brought it to his attention.

My son understood this, so your adult husband can too.", "NTA. I assume he is aware that you don't share his view of your dog's entertainment value, as you say this is a constant thing.

I'm an LMFT, which is more-or-less a marriage-specific therapist, and what your husband is doing is referred to as an \"emotional bid.\" Gottman coined the term to refer to when your partner basically reaches out to you to share in their joy. Imagine a husband saying, \"Honey, come look at this pretty bird out the window!\" It's not about the bird, however pretty it may be. It's about taking time out of your day to share something together, and it's a sign of a healthy marriage.\n\nYour husband isn't trying to annoy you, though he's certainly succeeding. He's trying to share a moment with you, and while he needs to be better about not interrupting you, don't shut him down entirely. The picture idea is a good one. You don't get interrupted, and he still gets to make his emotional bid.", "He already isn't listening when she talks. Actions speak louder than words.", "NTA. This is by far the best response here. If I could upvote it 1,000 times I wous", "Wow thank you for explaining this. I\u2019ve realized this is definitely something I do. Not to the extent of OP\u2019s partner, but I am the type of person who really enjoys sharing the joys and happiness of life with my partner. I do occasionally do the \u201clook at the cat!\u201d and she does too, but not excessively. I definitely do it with other things also. I\u2019ve realized it can really bother me if I\u2019m introducing my girlfriend to a show that is really special or important to me, or was a big part of my childhood, and they talk/get distracted during a really meaningful scene or something. I wonder if that\u2019s the same thing. I think I\u2019m very big on wanting to somewhat be able to walk in each others shoes and share mutual emotions about important things. Of course that will never happen perfectly and it\u2019s unrealistic and unhealthy to expect it to.", "Yea but it depends on actual conversation, if it just ok sit and she saids \"look I like my free time and don't want to be bother while doing chores/cooking ok? And he said ok don't correct the behavior. Questions like why do you asking me to drop what I'm doing to look at the dog? Once you ask why then it actually address the problem then you can come up with solutions to fix it like putting a new rule saying if the dog is doing something silly then just take a picture of it and show me later or just send it to my phone and I'll look at it later.", "There are easy ways to fix that like just saying no, just send me a video or picture of when he does it while just keep reading, she has multiple choices of just ignoring him, giving him option of sending it through phone and actually going to look at the dog. When I say conversation I mean actual deep emotional conversation and then actually going through with what you said you will do even if it one sided. The other partner will learn and will adjust to how you treat the situation.", "Yea which her actions can be multiple things, not one by leaving the house. \n\n1. Action of just saying no and then ignore him. \n\n2. Send a text saying anything silly dog related just send here."]}
