I am simply not an individual who wants to focus on what a dog is doing all the time. I don't think that everything a dog does is cute or funny. I respect that some people are definitely the complete opposite and I never give people a hard time about it. I am simply just not that person. My husband IS that person though. We have a dog (2yo corgi mix) and absolutely everything she does is just down right adorable/hilarious to my husband. Even her laying normal and looking out the window is something he will start laughing over and telling me to stop what I'm doing to watch her. It doesn't matter what I'm doing honestly, he truly doesn't care. Reading a book, writing, drawing, cooking, doing the dishes, mopping, taking the garbage out, laundry, working, etc. He will 100% say \"babe come look at the dog, quick\" and she will quite literally not be doing anything at all but sitting there. I don't see the amusement. I don't see it as adorable. Maybe I'm broken, who knows. I love the dog. I simply just don't think everything she does warrants my complete undivided attention. I've tried explaining this to him so many times that I'm honestly just ridiculously tired of having the repeated conversation. He continues to ask me to stop what I'm doing to watch her while he's laughing hysterically regardless of these conversations. It's becoming quite exhausting, to be honest. \n\nSo I was on the porch in my hammock and reading my book. He comes out per usual and said \"babe, quick come look at the doggo\". I will admit that even hearing this kind of set me off because I'm trying to read and I know for a fact she was probably doing nothing. I go in anyways and I was correct. She wasn't doing anything. So I just kind of dead pan my husband and say \"what exactly is she doing that I had to stop reading for?\" He says something about how she was covering her face or something and it was funny but she apparently stopped. So I said \"okay well I'm reading now so..\" and I walk back outside. Not even 15 minutes later he comes back out and says \"quick, hurry, she's doing it again\". I honestly didn't even say anything to him. I just put my shoes on, grabbed my keys and left. I'm currently sitting at the park, reading my book. Or I was trying, but now I'm conflicted because he texted me saying that I have made him feel like shit for trying to share his joy with me and that he doesn't understand why I can't even pretend to be amused for his sake. A part of me knows he's right because I mean.. I could at least pretend to find it amusing like he does but it's so frequent at this point and like.. I am tired of being interrupted in general to watch a dog do absolutely nothing.

I'm an LMFT, which is more-or-less a marriage-specific therapist, and what your husband is doing is referred to as an \"emotional bid.\" Gottman coined the term to refer to when your partner basically reaches out to you to share in their joy. Imagine a husband saying, \"Honey, come look at this pretty bird out the window!\" It's not about the bird, however pretty it may be. It's about taking time out of your day to share something together, and it's a sign of a healthy marriage.\n\nYour husband isn't trying to annoy you, though he's certainly succeeding. He's trying to share a moment with you, and while he needs to be better about not interrupting you, don't shut him down entirely. The picture idea is a good one.

He needs to understand how doing it over and over is annoying. You still love him and the dog.", "NAH My husband gets distracted by everything he sees. When he wants me to look and I don\u2019t want to I say no. \n\nIt sounds like you haven\u2019t told your husband that you prefer uninterrupted activities to constant interruptions. You might want to tell him that you plan on reading for the next hour and don\u2019t want to be interrupted unless the house is on fire.\n\nIn return, you can plan time to ooh and aah over everything he points out.", "Pretend to be amused for his sake says it all. \n\nNTA he knows you don\u2019t enjoy it but he still keeps doing it. How you feel should be enough to stop him doing it all the time. \n\nMaybe he can take photos of the dog each time he has the urge to share and you look at all the photos in one go at an agreed time? You not enjoying it should really be the end of this though.", "NTA. Your husband is inconsiderate and selfish. Your dog is the centre of his world but he won\u2019t respect it\u2019s not the centre of yours.", "NTA, your guy suffers from separation anxiety .", "NTA.  Ask him to set up a cctv to film the dog 24/7.  Then he can rewind the funny parts for you.", "NTA and while I agree it can definitely be annoying this is something that you should probably read.

Definitely NTAH.  Thinking 'it's adorable' that a dog is laying down looking out the window is kind of strange.  You could always turn the tables and call him to the window every time you see a bird outside or a bug or whatever...", "NTA. My brother recently got a dog, and it is very sweet watching him bond with the little guy and fawn all over him. I can also be the same way about my chihuahua. But you gotta read the room, and if folks aren't as into your dog as you are then you need to tone it down.\n\nAs far as how to address this with your husband, be frank but light hearted about it. Let him know that you understand how much he adores the dog, but clearly you two love the dog in different ways and you would appreciate it if he acknowledged that fact by refraining from calling you into the room every time the dog moves a muscle. Ask him to just take a quick pic/video to share if the dog does something he thinks you'd love. Let him know that you don't want this to become a bigger fight than it needs to be, and it's a good opportunity to practice your communication.", "YTA, but only for not loving dogs enough. You're justified in your feelings and your boyfriend isn't being respectful enough of your boundaries. You are in the right in every way. Just, dogs are always worth looking at so I assume you're fundamentally a bad person.", "NTA\n\nI too have a very adorable dog, but I can't remember the last time I told people around me to stop what they're doing to look at him. Even picture-wise I send a pic to my friend group maybe once a month because I recognize how annoying it can be for people to constantly have to recognize someone's pet or baby.\n\nYour husband is really weird and not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA, I empathize with both perspectives, because I\u2019m obsessed with everything my cat does. But he needs to find another outlet every-time he sees the dog doing something that he loves. \nI suggest he makes a social media account for the dog. The internet is filled with ppl that want to look at dogs.", "You have grown resentful of your husband and he is making \"cute\" bids to get you back. You should both be addressing the resentment; it's not about the dog for either of you.\n\nMild ESH (except the dog). Man/woman up and go to counselling. Bring the dog too, so it'll get a nice walk out of it.", "Well, I'm the worst person ever!  \nI didn't stop cooking when my daughter called that her 9 month old little sister put her foot in her mouth.  \nI mean this is baby #4 and I had seen her do it since she was 7 months old\u2026.  \nBut it was cute and sweet and I missed it!  \nYour husband is obsessed with that dog, more than a mother with her child!  \nI understand you needed a break, I love my kids more than anything in the world, but I also take breaks during the day from them, and some days I look forward to their bedtime!", "NTA. But my son and i (we went to pick our dog up from the shelter together when he was a puppy)...we do this exact thing. We say the same dog jokes over and over. I don't know why. Once, i asked him to stop doing it and he mimicked my jokes, to illustrate that i do it, too. Go figure.", "NTA. You\u2019ve made your disinterest clear, now it\u2019s time to make it an actual boundary and clearly define it. It\u2019s time for a real conversation without getting emotional about it.

Maybe he can start an instagram just for her?", "NTA OP - It is entirely possible for your husband to message you a picture of the dog.  Then you can see it in your own timing - if it brings you joy then, you can tell him and it'll double his enjoyment of the thing the dog did (when he viewed it, and then again when you did with all the joy in your heart, or whatever).  I routinely message one of my partners entire videos of my dog being an asshole, because he finds it hilarious.  But I don't drag him to my house to see it.", "Yes, he should start an Instagram account for the dog.\n\nMyself, I enjoy watching pictures or video of dogs, but I will do it when I am in the mood for it. I would find OP's husband annoying as hell.", "My dogs have an IG for sort of this reason. I think they are super cute and take a ton of pictures of them. IG is a way to show them off to people who want to look at cute dog pics. Most of their followers are other dog/pet accounts so it works out for everyone. \n\nMy hubs would be so annoyed if I frequently interrupted him to look at what the dogs are doing. Most of the time they have stopped doing whatever was cute within a 10-15 seconds, so by the time hubs got to the dog it would be over anyway.", "My boyfriend and I are exactly like OP's husband. Sometimes it feels like all we do in our spare time is look at the dog.
