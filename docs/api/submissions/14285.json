I am simply not an individual who wants to focus on what a dog is doing all the time. I don't think that everything a dog does is cute or funny. I respect that some people are definitely the complete opposite and I never give people a hard time about it. I am simply just not that person. My husband IS that person though. We have a dog (2yo corgi mix) and absolutely everything she does is just down right adorable/hilarious to my husband. Even her laying normal and looking out the window is something he will start laughing over and telling me to stop what I'm doing to watch her. It doesn't matter what I'm doing honestly, he truly doesn't care. Reading a book, writing, drawing, cooking, doing the dishes, mopping, taking the garbage out, laundry, working, etc. He will 100% say \"babe come look at the dog, quick\" and she will quite literally not be doing anything at all but sitting there. I don't see the amusement. I don't see it as adorable. Maybe I'm broken, who knows. I love the dog. I simply just don't think everything she does warrants my complete undivided attention. I've tried explaining this to him so many times that I'm honestly just ridiculously tired of having the repeated conversation. He continues to ask me to stop what I'm doing to watch her while he's laughing hysterically regardless of these conversations. It's becoming quite exhausting, to be honest. \n\nSo I was on the porch in my hammock and reading my book. He comes out per usual and said \"babe, quick come look at the doggo\". I will admit that even hearing this kind of set me off because I'm trying to read and I know for a fact she was probably doing nothing. I go in anyways and I was correct. She wasn't doing anything. So I just kind of dead pan my husband and say \"what exactly is she doing that I had to stop reading for?\" He says something about how she was covering her face or something and it was funny but she apparently stopped. So I said \"okay well I'm reading now so..\" and I walk back outside. Not even 15 minutes later he comes back out and says \"quick, hurry, she's doing it again\". I honestly didn't even say anything to him. I just put my shoes on, grabbed my keys and left. I'm currently sitting at the park, reading my book. Or I was trying, but now I'm conflicted because he texted me saying that I have made him feel like shit for trying to share his joy with me and that he doesn't understand why I can't even pretend to be amused for his sake. A part of me knows he's right because I mean.. I could at least pretend to find it amusing like he does but it's so frequent at this point and like.. I am tired of being interrupted in general to watch a dog do absolutely nothing.

I'm an LMFT, which is more-or-less a marriage-specific therapist, and what your husband is doing is referred to as an \"emotional bid.\" Gottman coined the term to refer to when your partner basically reaches out to you to share in their joy. Imagine a husband saying, \"Honey, come look at this pretty bird out the window!\" It's not about the bird, however pretty it may be. It's about taking time out of your day to share something together, and it's a sign of a healthy marriage.\n\nYour husband isn't trying to annoy you, though he's certainly succeeding. He's trying to share a moment with you, and while he needs to be better about not interrupting you, don't shut him down entirely. The picture idea is a good one.

The OP listed all the things she might be doing when she is asked to stop and go view the dog. What is the husband doing during these times? Simply watching the dog? if you took the dog out of the picture how is the division of activity in the home?\n\nIt could be one of two things. First it could be that the OP is bearing an inappropriate percentage of the household tasks. Nothing pisses me off more than trying to get something done while a freeloader has cute things to show me! Or it could be that the husband is recently retired or simply never cultivated at-home hobbies. Why isn't he reading or cooking or cleaning or building model ships or playing video games or gardening? \"I watch the dog do funny things\" is not a particularly appealing home r\u00e9sum\u00e9. I think there might be more to look at here.", "I agree with this. The IG idea is great. Then he can upload them and you can view at your leisure, \"like\" and comment to show involvement and also have other psycho obsessed people who wanna ooh and awwwwww over every dog fart to interact on the same level.", "That's perfectly reasonable! Not every emotional bid can be met with a positive response, which is why OP is N T A. She can't drop everything and look at the dog just because her husband wants her to. Same for your son. He's not interested? No big deal, that happens sometimes. Good on him for having boundaries, and also good on you for respecting them.\n\n*However,* (I'm sure you knew that was coming, ha ha), emotional bids have been studied. Think of the phrase, \"Come look at this\" as a verbal way of extending your hand to someone. That person can then either take your hand or smack it away. Having your hand smacked a couple of times is fine--even a couple of times a day is normal--but how many times can you endure that before you *stop* extending it? In behavioral psychology, it's called \"[extinction behavior](https://special-learning.com/article/extinction-in-aba/).\" When your emotional bids are consistently ignored, you stop making them.\n\nOne of the most famous examples Gottman cited was a married woman who said (I'm paraphrasing), \"He wouldn't come look at the tomatoes I grew. That's when I knew it was time to divorce.\" Like I mentioned above, it's not really about tomatoes. That woman's husband had certainly seen tomatoes before, and yet refusing to look at them was symptomatic of a larger issue. What she really wanted was for him to engage with her. His refusal was undoubtedly the last in a long line of failed emotional bids.\n\nEmpirically speaking, the \"how many times can you get your hand smacked\" answer is [not very many times](https://www.gottman.com/blog/an-introduction-to-emotional-bids-and-trust/).\n\n    Happy couples \"turn towards\" their partners approximately 20 times more than couples in distress during everyday, non-conflict discussions. Newlyweds who were still married six years after their wedding had turned towards each other 86% of the time while in the lab. Those who were divorced six years later, however, had only turned towards each other 33% of the time.\n\nYou raise an excellent point, though, and ftr, I do think the husband is the AH in this scenario. But assuming OP's issue isn't grounds for divorce, I hope OP understands it's not really about the dog. Or the bird. Or the tomatoes.", "Gottman's work is based on decades of real research.  Bringing in couples and hooking them up to sensors, videos carefully coded, follow up, the whole thing.", "Or even actually making pet ownership into a hobby for fuck's sake if he's so into it?

Why don't you wuv it enough? But it's his paaaaaaw! Like a hand and on his noooooooose?\" would absolutely cause me to flip my shit. *insert vomit noises here* I'm not 4. I don't care when my kids say shit like this. Hell, I didn't care when they DID shit like this, and I absolutely could not care less about a pet. . . doing what, exactly? Breathing? Contracting muscles? Using gravity? Just. Hell. No.  Want me to be impressed and engage? Do something impressive, worthy of engagement; just existing is in no way unique and you are undervaluing my time and overvaluing what is interesting and interruption worthy.

First it could be that the OP is bearing an inappropriate percentage of the household tasks. \\[...\\] Or it could be that the husband is recently retired or simply never cultivated at-home hobbies.\n\nThese are not the only two options. Many people are able to start and stop activities like chores and then continue them. Some people are multitaskers or do things in spirts. \n\nIf I was say folding laundry and saw one of the kids do something funny, then went to tell my husband, I could easily then just go back to doing laundry. Or if I was doing the dishes and the kids got into an argument or the toddler fell over and started to cry or whatever I could stop, deal with the thing, and then go right back to doing it. Yeah, being interrupted when you don't want to be can be annoying, but I don't think engaging in conversation or looking at the dog (who may well just be in the same room husband is doing stuff) is evidence he dosen't do chores. \n\nI often do stuff, stop and start, and continue. It's not evidence I never do any chores or cooking. Likewise my husband does show me things he finds funny and it's not evidence he dosen't do chores either. In fact, he might say be watching videos while doing and putting away the laundry, then see a funny short to show me, show me, and go back to laundry.", "Nothing hilarious, the fact remains she has plenty of options instead of leaving but she thought that was best which kind of proves there lack of judgement on both sides."]}
