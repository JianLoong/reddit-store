{"id": 14285, "submission_id": "12fne5f", "title": "AITA for leaving after he continuously told me to look at his dog?", "selftext": "I don't know how to explain this without people coming for my throat but I will try my best. I am simply not an individual who wants to focus on what a dog is doing all the time. I don't think that everything a dog does is cute or funny. I respect that some people are definitely the complete opposite and I never give people a hard time about it. I am simply just not that person. My husband IS that person though. We have a dog (2yo corgi mix) and absolutely everything she does is just down right adorable/hilarious to my husband. Even her laying normal and looking out the window is something he will start laughing over and telling me to stop what I'm doing to watch her. It doesn't matter what I'm doing honestly, he truly doesn't care. Reading a book, writing, drawing, cooking, doing the dishes, mopping, taking the garbage out, laundry, working, etc. He will 100% say \"babe come look at the dog, quick\" and she will quite literally not be doing anything at all but sitting there. I don't see the amusement. I don't see it as adorable. Maybe I'm broken, who knows. I love the dog. I simply just don't think everything she does warrants my complete undivided attention. I've tried explaining this to him so many times that I'm honestly just ridiculously tired of having the repeated conversation. He continues to ask me to stop what I'm doing to watch her while he's laughing hysterically regardless of these conversations. It's becoming quite exhausting, to be honest. \n\nSo I was on the porch in my hammock and reading my book. He comes out per usual and said \"babe, quick come look at the doggo\". I will admit that even hearing this kind of set me off because I'm trying to read and I know for a fact she was probably doing nothing. I go in anyways and I was correct. She wasn't doing anything. So I just kind of dead pan my husband and say \"what exactly is she doing that I had to stop reading for?\" He says something about how she was covering her face or something and it was funny but she apparently stopped. So I said \"okay well I'm reading now so..\" and I walk back outside. Not even 15 minutes later he comes back out and says \"quick, hurry, she's doing it again\". I honestly didn't even say anything to him. I just put my shoes on, grabbed my keys and left. I'm currently sitting at the park, reading my book. Or I was trying, but now I'm conflicted because he texted me saying that I have made him feel like shit for trying to share his joy with me and that he doesn't understand why I can't even pretend to be amused for his sake. A part of me knows he's right because I mean.. I could at least pretend to find it amusing like he does but it's so frequent at this point and like.. I am tired of being interrupted in general to watch a dog do absolutely nothing. I'm tired of feeling like my life has to be revolved around a dog doing nothing and I don't want to mentally strain myself pretending I understand the hype.

Or he can start an IG account for the dog \"to share his joy\". The internet loves cute dogs.  \n\nI have dogs, and love them, but I can't stop every 15 minutes to view them, or I'll never get a damn thing done.\n\nYou should not have to pretend to enjoy something \"for his sake\".  The husband is making you responsible for his feelings. If he can't be happy unless you do what he wants... that's a problem.  HIS problem.", "NTA.  Dogs are great but so is having a moment\u2019s peace.  If he texted you he presumably has a phone, that has a camera, that he could use to snap a picture of the adorable thing the dog is doing.  Wanting you to jump up this very minute to pay attention to the dog multiple times a day is not about the dog - it\u2019s about wanting you to pay attention to *him*.", "NTA. Keep leaving every time he wants you to look. Maybe an old dog can learn a new trick and let you read.", "NTA. Try to explain it to him. Tell him you are happy that he is all over that dog, but you don't have the same amount of enthusiasm. It's perfectly okay. If it makes him angry, you can counter that you don't run to him and force him to read a part of the book you really enjoyed.", "You have expressed your feelings to your husband yet he continues to ignore your request for him to stop. Is he wanting more of your attention and using the dog as a means to get it? Does he disregard your feelings in other ways? You are not broken for not feeling the same excitement as he does! I have three dogs and find the silliest things adorable, but I wouldn't expect anyone else to feel the same, especially after they have shared that they don't. You can love your dogsdogdogdogsdogdog and not be enamored by their every behavior. If it is bothering you enough that you had to leave from frustration it has gone way past him \"sharing his joy\". He needs to pay attention! I wish you luck, NTA!", "NTA, he needs to give you space to relax, and easily could just take a picture or send you a video  if the dog is doing something cute he wants to share.  Maybe he could start an instagram page for the dog, so he has sn outlet for sharing that doesn\u2019t involve bothering you.", "NTA. He cares nothing about your boundaries or about what brings YOU joy. To him, his desire to \u201cshare his joy\u201d with you far outweighs your boundaries or feelings. \n>\nThe fact that he literally wants you to *pretend to be amused for his sake* is an enormous red flag. He\u2019s literally telling you that he does not care how you really feel as long as you are faking it, for HIS sake and happiness.\n\nHonestly this entitled attitude would be a dealbreaker for me. I cannot comprehend living with someone who is so incredibly disrespectful of my time that I\u2019d have to (rightfully so) sneak off to the park to be able to read my book.", "NTA. I have 5 dogs, and sometimes they do really dumb or funny things. I'll laugh at it, but if they are just sitting doing nothing, then why laugh. Honestly, if my dog is laying down in a cute position, I'll take a picture, but I won't stop anyone else's life over it.", "NTA. My mom does this to me with my own son lol. Like, damn, I've seen him watch Frozen 2 before. Yes, he's adorable. Can I please get back to frantically cleaning while you're \"watching\" him?", "NTA. I understand him wanting to share his joy with you, but that can become excessive after a while. You just aren\u2019t into the dog as much as he is, and this is fine. You have tried to talk to him and set a reasonable boundary, and he has showed you no respect by ignoring you entirely. Basically, he had this coming for a long time, and him being blindsided by it shows just how self-centered he is and unwilling to see the world by anyone else\u2019s view. \n\nYour response of leaving to get some peace was a completely reasonable response, and he should have taken it as a hint as to how unreasonable he was getting as opposed to only thinking about how he feels. \n\nThe one consistent thing throughout this whole story is that your husband never once takes your feelings or wants into account.", "NTA. Surely he has a goddamn smart phone with a camera, right?\n\nI get it, my dogs crack me up doing literally nothing. My phone is full of ridiculous photos of them staring out the window. It is what it is. But I don\u2019t need to divert my loved ones away from their preferred activity just to force them to stare at a dog with its head tilted quizzically to the side. \n\nI\u2019ll turn it into a reaction meme and send it to my spouse/kids when they\u2019re doing something goofy and least expect it.", "NTA. \n\nI have two corgis. They are my whole fricken world. I absolutely love every little thing they do. Seriously I am exactly like your husband in that regard. BUT I don\u2019t expect anyone else to be that way with them.\n\nI even used to call my partner over every time they did something adorable. But I came to realize that I think everything they do is adorable and it\u2019s ridiculous to interrupt my partner every 5 seconds. You\u2019ve brought this up to him before so he didn\u2019t even need to have the self realization that I had because someone else brought it to his attention. He needs to be able to enjoy the dog without needing someone else to enjoy the dog with him. Sounds like co-dependency issues and he needs to be able to enjoy life alone.", "NTA\n\nHe's utterly disrespectful of your time and attention. And what kind of partner wants you to \"pretend\" to share his joy? Personally, I want an authentic emotional response from my partner. How else am I supposed to learn who they are as a person so I can nurture an authentic bond with THEM instead of some unrealistic fantasy version I've created in my head?\n\nAnd now he's trying to guilt-trip and emotionally manipulate you. He seriously needs some therapy to work through his issues.", "NTA. You shouldn't ever have to pretend to be happy or amused to anyone. Especially not your spouse whom you should be able to be completely yourself around.\n\nWhy do you have to pretend to be amused for the sake of his happiness, yet he doesn't seem to have a care about your happiness?", "NTA\n\nJust tell him to take a picture to show you later or something.", "I'm obsessed with my dog, but this behavior would drive me crazy too. NTA", "NTA. Some people just should not have dogs. By that, I\u2019m referring to your husband. It\u2019s a goddamn pet. Yes, they can be fun and you care for them and all. But when they develop this over the top worship of them, it\u2019s really sick. \n\nYou need to have a very sharp conversation with your husbands that his life seems totally out of balance and that he\u2019s should seek help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I only typed \"dog\" and it won't let me edit that error. Strange glitch!", "I mean faking enjoying or doing stuff is included in marriage. For example if you hate your in laws but still have to meet them so you just fake being nice to them to make your SO happy.\n\nAlso it being deal breaker over minor thing of him wanting to share what he thinks the dog is doing and having trouble understanding her point of view is ridiculous. Marriage is about communication, partners for life while taking on issues together. All OP need to do is sit down and actually discuss it with her husband. It really that simple. Divorce don't fix issues like these.", "How is asking to look at something is seeing someone as a object? I'm a therapist and I wouldn't even make this statement. There is a co-dependency  issue but it nothing like how you say it is. All they need to do is sit down and have a conversation about it. It really simple and positive the issue will be solved as soon they actually communicate.", "OP *has* discussed it with her husband multiple times.", "I agree with everything but:\n\n>All OP need to do is sit down and actually discuss it with her husband.\n\nShe stated that she HAS told him, many times, that she doesn't want to be constantly interrupted. He doesn't care. Communication is a two-way street, and he's not on it. She can keep telling him forever, but he won't listen. \n\nIf he were only telling her to come look once every few weeks or so, fine, pretend the dog is the cutest thing you've ever seen once every few weeks. But I would be irritated as hell with constant interruptions too, and far more irritated with a partner who doesn't listen to or care about my feelings."]}
