I am simply not an individual who wants to focus on what a dog is doing all the time. I don't think that everything a dog does is cute or funny. I respect that some people are definitely the complete opposite and I never give people a hard time about it. I am simply just not that person. My husband IS that person though. We have a dog (2yo corgi mix) and absolutely everything she does is just down right adorable/hilarious to my husband. Even her laying normal and looking out the window is something he will start laughing over and telling me to stop what I'm doing to watch her. It doesn't matter what I'm doing honestly, he truly doesn't care. Reading a book, writing, drawing, cooking, doing the dishes, mopping, taking the garbage out, laundry, working, etc. He will 100% say \"babe come look at the dog, quick\" and she will quite literally not be doing anything at all but sitting there. I don't see the amusement. I don't see it as adorable. Maybe I'm broken, who knows. I love the dog. I simply just don't think everything she does warrants my complete undivided attention. I've tried explaining this to him so many times that I'm honestly just ridiculously tired of having the repeated conversation. He continues to ask me to stop what I'm doing to watch her while he's laughing hysterically regardless of these conversations. It's becoming quite exhausting, to be honest. \n\nSo I was on the porch in my hammock and reading my book. He comes out per usual and said \"babe, quick come look at the doggo\". I will admit that even hearing this kind of set me off because I'm trying to read and I know for a fact she was probably doing nothing. I go in anyways and I was correct. She wasn't doing anything. So I just kind of dead pan my husband and say \"what exactly is she doing that I had to stop reading for?\" He says something about how she was covering her face or something and it was funny but she apparently stopped. So I said \"okay well I'm reading now so..\" and I walk back outside. Not even 15 minutes later he comes back out and says \"quick, hurry, she's doing it again\". I honestly didn't even say anything to him. I just put my shoes on, grabbed my keys and left. I'm currently sitting at the park, reading my book. Or I was trying, but now I'm conflicted because he texted me saying that I have made him feel like shit for trying to share his joy with me and that he doesn't understand why I can't even pretend to be amused for his sake. A part of me knows he's right because I mean.. I could at least pretend to find it amusing like he does but it's so frequent at this point and like.. I am tired of being interrupted in general to watch a dog do absolutely nothing. I'm tired of feeling like my life has to be revolved around a dog doing nothing and I don't want to mentally strain myself pretending I understand the hype.

I'm an LMFT, which is more-or-less a marriage-specific therapist, and what your husband is doing is referred to as an \"emotional bid.\" Gottman coined the term to refer to when your partner basically reaches out to you to share in their joy. Imagine a husband saying, \"Honey, come look at this pretty bird out the window!\" It's not about the bird, however pretty it may be. It's about taking time out of your day to share something together, and it's a sign of a healthy marriage.\n\nYour husband isn't trying to annoy you, though he's certainly succeeding.

The OP listed all the things she might be doing when she is asked to stop and go view the dog. What is the husband doing during these times? Simply watching the dog? if you took the dog out of the picture how is the division of activity in the home?\n\nIt could be one of two things. First it could be that the OP is bearing an inappropriate percentage of the household tasks. Nothing pisses me off more than trying to get something done while a freeloader has cute things to show me! Or it could be that the husband is recently retired or simply never cultivated at-home hobbies.

Not every emotional bid can be met with a positive response, which is why OP is N T A. She can't drop everything and look at the dog just because her husband wants her to. Same for your son. He's not interested? No big deal, that happens sometimes. Good on him for having boundaries, and also good on you for respecting them.\n\n*However,* (I'm sure you knew that was coming, ha ha), emotional bids have been studied. Think of the phrase, \"Come look at this\" as a verbal way of extending your hand to someone. That person can then either take your hand or smack it away. Having your hand smacked a couple of times is fine--even a couple of times a day is normal--but how many times can you endure that before you *stop* extending it? In behavioral psychology, it's called \"[extinction behavior](https://special-learning.com/article/extinction-in-aba/).\" When your emotional bids are consistently ignored, you stop making them.\n\nOne of the most famous examples Gottman cited was a married woman who said (I'm paraphrasing), \"He wouldn't come look at the tomatoes I grew. That's when I knew it was time to divorce.\" Like I mentioned above, it's not really about tomatoes. That woman's husband had certainly seen tomatoes before, and yet refusing to look at them was symptomatic of a larger issue. What she really wanted was for him to engage with her. His refusal was undoubtedly the last in a long line of failed emotional bids.\n\nEmpirically speaking, the \"how many times can you get your hand smacked\" answer is [not very many times](https://www.gottman.com/blog/an-introduction-to-emotional-bids-and-trust/).\n\n    Happy couples \"turn towards\" their partners approximately 20 times more than couples in distress during everyday, non-conflict discussions. Newlyweds who were still married six years after their wedding had turned towards each other 86% of the time while in the lab. Those who were divorced six years later, however, had only turned towards each other 33% of the time.\n\nYou raise an excellent point, though, and ftr, I do think the husband is the AH in this scenario. But assuming OP's issue isn't grounds for divorce, I hope OP understands it's not really about the dog. Or the bird. Or the tomatoes.", "Gottman's work is based on decades of real research.

I'm not expert but that sounds like a good compromise for both of them.", "I feel like that\u2019s just going to open a can of worms where she has to set his texts to silent or else her phone would constantly be going off, but then she\u2019s likely miss actual relevant and possibly time-sensitive messages?", "Or my personal favorite: You get the text with the picture of the pet just being a normal pet. And then they come beat your home office door down with \"did you get it did you look did you see it did you see the picture did you look?\"", "YTA. You must observe doggo. /j\n\nIn all seriousness, NTA, do what you want with your own fuckin eyes", "NTA.\n\nThere's sharing amusement/interest, and there's being an annoying AH (which he is).", "NTA. Is your husband 5? He sounds like a little kid at the pool constantly yelling \u201cmommy mommy look at me!\u201d He sounds exhausting. Maybe he could take over more of the housework if he has nothing else to do but stare at the dog.", "Just ask him to take a picture and you'll look at it later. Is there something that you like that he doesn't - there's your compromise.\n\nAlso I'm sorry but I laughed so much at this - and I love my dogs", "NTA- Unfortunately, you\u2019re going to have to start treating him like a dog with undesirable behavior. A human understands something once told, a pet must be reinforced with repetition. When he asks you to come see the dog, just say NO. Don\u2019t go into some long explanation of why, he knows why, you\u2019ve told him. He doesn\u2019t care, his amusement is more important than what you are doing. Pretty selfish behavior frankly. So..just NO. If this does not solve your problem after a week or so, stop answering him entirely when he says this. I think he will eventually get the message, but reinforcement is necessary in training. Good luck.", "NTA and the way you describe this playing out seems really manipulative and selfish. Is this the only instance he completely stomps all over your feelings and boundaries because his precious feelings are more important? This man sounds like a demanding toddler", "NTA. This isn't about the dog. This is about boundaries, ones that your husband clearly thinks are less important than his love of the dog. My parents have an adorable, beautiful cat, and there are some things she does that are cute. However, I don't feel the need to take photos of her every single time I'm visiting my parents, tell my family to see everything she does, or insist that my family tell me a minute by minute of her day. Keep setting boundaries for him.", "You\u2018re NTA. Your husband is demanding your attention in a way that isn\u2019t really about your dog. It\u2019s about his need to have you focus on him. If he doesn\u2019t have some of your attention every 15 minutes, he gets anxious, and as a result he\u2019s pestering you in a way that makes you incredibly anxious. It\u2019s not healthy, though. You love your dog very much and you find your own cute moments with her. You don\u2019t demand that he drops everything, every time, when one of those happens.", "I love dogs but really don't like Corgis. And the people I know that have Corgis are all like this. In fact, that might be why I don't like Corgis.", "NTA. My partner is the exact same way. I love dogs, but like I don\u2019t want to see 20 pictures of the dog just laying down with him going \u201coh my gosh the dog was so cute today!!! Did you see the pictures yet?!?!\u201d. I love my partner but it\u2019s a bit annoying sometimes.", "Nta, I would suggest asking him to take a picture or video and showing you later when you are not preoccupied or when you are snuggling in bed or some other designated time. I do not suggest texting you, because that would be disruptive.\n\nIt is great that he wants to share things he takes joy in, but he shouldn\u2019t be constantly interrupting you when you are focusing on things you enjoy or are working on. That is rude, disruptive, annoying, and disrespectful.", "I can understand he's excited to have a dog but bothering you all day to see what the dog is doing gets annoying pretty quickly\n\nNTA, your husband can enjoy the dog all he wants and take pictures for you to see but he needs to leave you alone and\n\n>he doesn't understand why I can't even pretend to be amused for his sake\n\nthis is even worse, because resentments only grow and this is what your husband is asking you, to hide what you feel until you inevitably explode, that's stupid AF.", "Love the the Insta idea", "My partner and I have 2 cats. He\u2019s not fond of cats. I laugh at his obviously over exaggerated irritation and then I send pics. He can look them, which I prefer, or he can ignore them, which I\u2019ll never know, but I have shared something that\u2019s important to me and I know that makes it important to him. \n\nThere\u2019s rarely anything I personally see that would require a partner to \u201cdrop everything and come instantly\u201d. NTA", "Truly. I don't have a dog, but have 3 cats which are very frequently being cute, dweebs, or otherwise. I also work, do chores, and love to read. Inevitably, I miss many of these moments. But if my partner was looking at them constantly and determined that I wasn't going to miss any of them, it would get very old, very fast. I'm willing to miss some cute moments to read and relax in silence, or to accomplish something uninterrupted.", "Lol classic Reddit. \u201cYou may be a professional speaking from years of experience and peer-reviewed research, but here\u2019s why you\u2019re wrong and I, Dipshit McNobody, am right.\u201d \ud83d\ude02"]}
