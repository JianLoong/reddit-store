My downstairs neighbor has been a source of stress for me because of his constant banging. He bangs when he feels I\u2019m too noisy. However I truly am not an obnoxious individual. I do not play loud music (or music at all), I do not host late night parties, I do not clean at odd hours, I do not have crazy loud hobbies, I do not exercise in my apartment. I feel as though I even take extra precautions to be quiet such as never wearing shoes in my apartment and walking in strategically placed towels and other pieces of cloth to dampen my footsteps. \n\nThe worst is in the mornings. The thing is my job necessitates me leaving for work at 5am. When my phone alarm goes off to wake me up he bangs. When I take a shower he bangs. Now because of my work, my sleep schedule can be out of whack sometimes. For instance I\u2019ll walk across my apartment to cook something at 2am, and he\u2019ll bang. The cooking itself is not the source of noise, no pots and pans clanging, but rather the walking. Or I\u2019ll be on my phone, and on accident it\u2019ll slip out of my hand, hit my face and then the ground and he\u2019ll bang. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m walking on egg shells in my own apartment. I feel like I can\u2019t use my TV without headphones because he\u2019ll bang. This morning, and the inspiration for this post, I literally just stood up out of my bed and put my feet on the ground to get ready for work, and he banged. Though am I an asshole for having a job that makes me leave for work at 5am? Am I an asshole for tripping over a shoe in my own apartment? \n\nI feel the real source of the problem is the cheap materials the building is made out of. We live in hands down the cheapest apartments in the cheapest neighborhood of the city. The rent is a steal. I feel like no matter who lived here, or how loud/quiet they were, he\u2019d be able to hear them, and he\u2019d bang.\n\nI have gone and spoken with him about this, and very tactfully explained that I do indeed make an effort but he just gets angry and then I say that I feel his expectations are unreasonable. I pay over a $1000 a month to live somewhere without roommates, I ought to be able to come and go as I please. I ought to be able to cook myself a meal in my own home. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682535503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12zuos6/aita_for_leaving_my_apartment_at_5am_to_go_to_work/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

INFO:  Do you ever hear noise from him?\n\nYou need to get your apt. Manager involved immediately.  Ask your manager to come over, show him the towels, etc. and effort you make.  Then demonstrate the walking, dropping a phone, etc. or make your alarm go off, so that he will start up. This to prove to the manager just how ordinary your actions are, when your neighbor complains.\n\nNo doubt (!!!) you will get lots of suggestions to start banging when you hear him, or to just start making lots of noise, walking in shoes, watching tv, etc. That would feel good, but would lose the leverage you could gain with your landlord if you first prove that you are not the bad guy, here.  Good luck!  NTA\n\nEdited for spelling", "Obviously NTA.\n\nWhat is your landlord doing about this? \n\nI just experienced this nightmare where the other tenant in our house expected zero noise in the house. We ended up calling the police to begin the work necessary to have him charged with harassment but then he moved out thankfully.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to talk to him and he got aggressive. Your next step is the office/landlord as escalate as needed. You have every right to make normal sounds and noise in your own home, regardless of the thinness of the walls. It sounds like you've already gone above and beyond to be kind and courteous, but some people are not able to be reasoned with. His harassment is not okay.     \n\n\nShared living environments come with the sounds of people living and moving around. Of course it's annoying to hear all the noises neighbors make, but as long as you aren't being overtly obnoxious he can go kick rocks - I say this as someone who has lived in apartments for the last 10 years as like many people, I'm priced out of houses both renting and buying.  It sucks, but it is what it is.", "NTA. It's great to be courteous to neighbors, if they return the courtesy.\n\nThis guy doesn't. Stop caring. You are allowed to walk, and cook, and experience gravity without constantly worrying about the delicate flower that lives below you. \n\nYou might want to let the landlord know about the damage that Downstairs Guy and his superhero hearing condition are doing to the ceilings.", "NTA\n\nBuy a basketball", "NTA at all! Your neighbour is harassing you. This is beyond unreasonable. You should not be made to feel bad for existing in your own home. You have a few options on how to handle this which I'm sure you've considered but really your neighbour is causing the noise issue with all the banging. It really is harassment.", "NTA. Sounds like he is far louder than you with all that banging. It could be a lot worse for him. You are going above and beyond being considerate. \n\nAre there neighbors on the side of his apartment? Below? If so, do they have anything to say about all this banging? He is harassing you. Living in an apartment means dealing with a certain amount of noise. His expectations are unreasonable. Talk to your landlord and let them know what is going on then go about your business. I assume the landlord will understand that you need to work to pay your rent.", "NTA. neighbors suck. if you're actively trying to account for noise, that's more than any of my neighbors ever did & I didn't make my irritation THEIR problem (except for this one time a couple living next to me had a screaming match & threw stuff- I spoke up for that one).\n\nTalk to your neighbor. You're being considerate - you still have to live your life- & they need to chill the f\\*ck out", "NTA at all.\n\nHe\u2019s being bothersome for no reason. Those sound like completely normal life sounds.", "NTA. You are way too agreeable man. Stop walking on eggshells, it's your home and as long as you aren't playing loud music or yelling then do what you want. Your neighbor has to suck it in and cope..what does he expect? You aligning your daily routine and lifestyle to his?", "NTA \n\nThis is what happens when the apartments are made with paper. \n\nI get that it's annoying to hear the people upstairs moving, but tell him next time he complaints that if he doesn't want to hear anything, he can move. \n\nThe only thing I'd suggest you change is taking the shower at night and not early morning because that is something that makes a lot of noise in those types of buildings. But besides that, I'd start watching TV without headphones and maybe even jump and make more noise when he starts banging on the wall when you're doing nothing too noisy.", "NTA. As long as you\u2019re being mindful of the amount of noise you produce, there\u2019s only so much you can do about noise of daily life. Living in apartments comes with the noise of other tenants, your neighbor can take a chill pill with the banging.", "NTA. Since he bangs no matter what I suggest a nice Viking Death Metal music from 5 am to 10am is in order", "NTA - he can\u2019t be a pain about you living in your space doing what normal people do. I would recommend you set up a camera to record your movements in case he makes complaints about noise to your building management / landlord. A friend of mine had this happening with her neighbor who shared a wall. The complaints would be even when she was asleep. She has some cameras on for watching her cats when she\u2019s not home and it captured her walking around her space and simply putting something down on a countertop when the neighborly loudly slams the wall. She sent it to her landlord for proof that she wasn\u2019t being excessively loud and the situation was handled from there.", "NTA, you should talk to building management as his actions are unreasonable. Geez, if I were you I'd probably do the opposite and make extra noise to show how quiet I normally am. If switching apartments isn't an option for you, your only recourse is to try to have management intervene.", "NTA, start becoming louder and pick up a weekly poker game or perhaps dutch folk dancing (you know, with the clogs ;D)", "NTA, personally I would become petty and start stomping everywhere I walked and actually give him something to bang about.", "NTA at all.  The guy may have sensitive hearing?  Or it could be the building?  Talk to the property manager about it?  Good luck.", "NTA this is harrasement. Report them", "NTA. Try to live normally from now one, he bangs? His problem. I'm not saying you should blast music but you should live normally walking in your house, cooking, having showers, ecc if he doesn't like it he can put on some ear plugs.", "NTA. It's his problem, not yours.", "NTA - you need to contact your leasing office about the harassment you're receiving.  He bangs on the ceiling when you take a SHOWER??  That's ridiculous.", "NTA...You have a right to reasonable enjoyment of your premises. Report him to your building management or landlord.  Document everything.  This is bordering on harassment.", "NTA bang back", "Do you live in Monica and Rachel's apartment? J/k :) \nNTA, he is.", "So here's the deal. Put down rugs and wear fuzzy slippers and then complain fo the manager. Your ok. Your NTA and when he bangs just record the noise", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I also lived in a super cheap apartment with very thin walls/floors + I had roommates and also had to wake up at 5AM. \n\nAs long as you're making an effort to be quiet, there's not much you can do. \n\nDoes this dude not sleep? It sounds like he's deliberately listening out for your noises in order to get mad.", "NTA His expectations ARE unreasonable.  You should be free to live your life in your space. I once lived above someone with PTSD from an abusive relationship. I really felt bad for her but I couldn\u2019t even walk to the bathroom barefoot without her banging on my door about the noise. My landlord finally, after many many complaints from her about my normal living noises, gently suggested perhaps she should find an apartment where she\u2019s not living under people.  She moved out a few months after that.", "NTA. I'm in a downstairs apt and I understand how loud simple walking around can be (there are times we wonder exactly when the upstairs neighbors took up pogo jumping) but some of that just goes along with the whole 'living in an apartment' territory. When you live in close proximity to other humans, you hear them moving around and living their lives. Most of us learn to laugh it off and go conveniently deaf to a lot of it.\n\nSo far as your alarm goes, as long as you're not letting it blare for long stretches of time, then ignore the downstairs guy. You have to get up when you have to get up for work, there's nothing you can do about that. I would start keeping a record of what you're doing when he bangs, what time it is, and how loud the bangs are, then turn that over to your apartment manager/rental company. As you've noted, you have the right to live your life without constantly fearing harassment from your neighbor.", "NTA- you arent breaking sound ordinance so get louder and eff him he's harassing you at this point.

Have a week without trying to be quiet, then ask him which he prefers", "\"walking in strategically placed towels and other pieces of cloth to dampen my footsteps.\"\n\nStop that immediately!

So regularly in fact that I now point out to tenants the regulations that cover noise complaints. What many people who complain about noise fail to understand is that there is a very big difference between noise and sounds. \n\nLoosely defined, sounds are the normal result of daily living which by their nature are unavoidable. These things are not defined as noise: children playing, children crying, people walking, furniture moving, people talking etc.. Noise is something that can be controlled such as amplified music, heavy machinery, construction, yelling etc.\n\nWhen I have a tenant screaming and yelling and banging in reaction to their neighbour doing normal things it is the complainer that gets the warning and possible eviction.", "NTA.
