My downstairs neighbor has been a source of stress for me because of his constant banging. He bangs when he feels I\u2019m too noisy. However I truly am not an obnoxious individual. I do not play loud music (or music at all), I do not host late night parties, I do not clean at odd hours, I do not have crazy loud hobbies, I do not exercise in my apartment. I feel as though I even take extra precautions to be quiet such as never wearing shoes in my apartment and walking in strategically placed towels and other pieces of cloth to dampen my footsteps. \n\nThe worst is in the mornings. The thing is my job necessitates me leaving for work at 5am. When my phone alarm goes off to wake me up he bangs. When I take a shower he bangs. Now because of my work, my sleep schedule can be out of whack sometimes. For instance I\u2019ll walk across my apartment to cook something at 2am, and he\u2019ll bang. The cooking itself is not the source of noise, no pots and pans clanging, but rather the walking. Or I\u2019ll be on my phone, and on accident it\u2019ll slip out of my hand, hit my face and then the ground and he\u2019ll bang. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m walking on egg shells in my own apartment. I feel like I can\u2019t use my TV without headphones because he\u2019ll bang. This morning, and the inspiration for this post, I literally just stood up out of my bed and put my feet on the ground to get ready for work, and he banged. Though am I an asshole for having a job that makes me leave for work at 5am? Am I an asshole for tripping over a shoe in my own apartment? \n\nI feel the real source of the problem is the cheap materials the building is made out of. We live in hands down the cheapest apartments in the cheapest neighborhood of the city. The rent is a steal. I feel like no matter who lived here, or how loud/quiet they were, he\u2019d be able to hear them, and he\u2019d bang.\n\nI have gone and spoken with him about this, and very tactfully explained that I do indeed make an effort but he just gets angry and then I say that I feel his expectations are unreasonable.

INFO:  Do you ever hear noise from him?\n\nYou need to get your apt. Manager involved immediately.  Ask your manager to come over, show him the towels, etc. and effort you make.  Then demonstrate the walking, dropping a phone, etc. or make your alarm go off, so that he will start up. This to prove to the manager just how ordinary your actions are, when your neighbor complains.\n\nNo doubt (!!!) you will get lots of suggestions to start banging when you hear him, or to just start making lots of noise, walking in shoes, watching tv, etc. That would feel good, but would lose the leverage you could gain with your landlord if you first prove that you are not the bad guy, here.  Good luck!

Your next step is the office/landlord as escalate as needed. You have every right to make normal sounds and noise in your own home, regardless of the thinness of the walls. It sounds like you've already gone above and beyond to be kind and courteous, but some people are not able to be reasoned with. His harassment is not okay.     \n\n\nShared living environments come with the sounds of people living and moving around. Of course it's annoying to hear all the noises neighbors make, but as long as you aren't being overtly obnoxious he can go kick rocks - I say this as someone who has lived in apartments for the last 10 years as like many people, I'm priced out of houses both renting and buying.  It sucks, but it is what it is.", "NTA. It's great to be courteous to neighbors, if they return the courtesy.\n\nThis guy doesn't. Stop caring.

Your neighbour is harassing you. This is beyond unreasonable. You should not be made to feel bad for existing in your own home.

Sounds like he is far louder than you with all that banging. It could be a lot worse for him. You are going above and beyond being considerate. \n\nAre there neighbors on the side of his apartment? Below? If so, do they have anything to say about all this banging? He is harassing you. Living in an apartment means dealing with a certain amount of noise. His expectations are unreasonable. Talk to your landlord and let them know what is going on then go about your business. I assume the landlord will understand that you need to work to pay your rent.", "NTA. neighbors suck. if you're actively trying to account for noise, that's more than any of my neighbors ever did & I didn't make my irritation THEIR problem (except for this one time a couple living next to me had a screaming match & threw stuff- I spoke up for that one).\n\nTalk to your neighbor. You're being considerate - you still have to live your life- & they need to chill the f\\*ck out", "NTA at all.\n\nHe\u2019s being bothersome for no reason.

But besides that, I'd start watching TV without headphones and maybe even jump and make more noise when he starts banging on the wall when you're doing nothing too noisy.", "NTA. As long as you\u2019re being mindful of the amount of noise you produce, there\u2019s only so much you can do about noise of daily life.

I would recommend you set up a camera to record your movements in case he makes complaints about noise to your building management / landlord. A friend of mine had this happening with her neighbor who shared a wall. The complaints would be even when she was asleep. She has some cameras on for watching her cats when she\u2019s not home and it captured her walking around her space and simply putting something down on a countertop when the neighborly loudly slams the wall. She sent it to her landlord for proof that she wasn\u2019t being excessively loud and the situation was handled from there.", "NTA, you should talk to building management as his actions are unreasonable. Geez, if I were you I'd probably do the opposite and make extra noise to show how quiet I normally am.

These things are not defined as noise: children playing, children crying, people walking, furniture moving, people talking etc.. Noise is something that can be controlled such as amplified music, heavy machinery, construction, yelling etc.\n\nWhen I have a tenant screaming and yelling and banging in reaction to their neighbour doing normal things it is the complainer that gets the warning and possible eviction.", "NTA.

He\u2019s the one infringing on your right to a peaceful dwelling. Not the other way around. NTA.\n\nA very similar thing happened to me when I was young and immature (and living in my first apartment - albeit with roommates). The 3 students downstairs had a gripe with us. To this day I\u2019m unsure what it is - we got along swimmingly for the first few months. All being uni students - we had similar schedules and activities. Though they had parties OFTEN - which didn\u2019t bother us because we were usually out. ANYWAYS they would do the exact same thing. Oven timer dings? BANGING. Get up off the couch? BANGING. One of us would dare to walk from one side of the apartment to the other. And guess what? YUP BANGING. It got to the point that they would add music to the mix and have multiple people bang on the ceilings in multiple rooms. Anyways we complained to the landlord over and over again but she continually wiped her hands of it. Until my mom - a legal professional - got wind and gave me sound advice. Between the three of us, we each started documenting EVERYTHING (there were many other incidents - including them turning off our heat manually - resulting in the landlord paying a premium to have an HVAC guy come out over the weekend). We amassed something like 6 full typed pages of incidents - times dates people present - matched with indexed evidence (photos, statements etc) in just 2 months or so. \n\nWe printed out the Landlord/Tenant law that indicated the landlord was responsible for keeping the peace. Called a meeting with the landlord. Presented her with the massive file of evidence and very gently explained we would be taking further legal action if she did fulfill this duty. \n\nIt was amazing. We had maybe one run in after that and then PEACE for the rest of our tenancy. \n\nI would suggest doing the same. File noise complaints with the landlord. See if they take any action\u2026 and really push them to. Find the local tenant laws and hold them to that. In the interim DOCUMENT everything. Dates, times, people present, location, and narrative.

They are NOT obligated to serve or protect, and 40% of cops self report committing domestic violence so who knows how many more actually perpetuate it. Biggest legal gang in this country.", "NTA, but, do you have all hardwood floors with no carpet / rugs etc? If so, those noises could genuinely sound really loud from below. \n\nNot saying he\u2019s in the right but it could be driving him nuts, or perhaps the person there before you was way worse and he\u2019s just massively on edge.", "nta - buy some wooden clogs and take up some sort of esoteric celtic dance hobby", "NTA- he shouldn't be living downstairs if walking bugs him that much. I would start recording how often he bangs and report to the office.", "NTA- this is harassment.  File a report with the landlord.  If he still bangs 24 hours later, file a police report.  I'm afraid he will get violent.", "Nta Dude, live your life. You pay rent. I would cut the towels and all that jazz immediately. Listen to music, dance, go to work. Maybe you\u2019ll be the reason he leaves. Good grief this is too much.", "NTA, you are just living life. like someone above said report his banging. If they do not do anything then take a sense of pride in his bangs. Drop a phone he bangs. Turn on the music. Cook and he bangs. Do some jumping jacks. Just go out of your way to make noise. F this guy. You shouldn\u2019t be walking on eggshells laugh about it this guy is a joke", "NTA. I think you need to start documenting the harassment and causes of it, report ot repeatedly to the landlord, call the police(I know, not preferable but with the harassment this might be needed) over the harassment if needed.", "I had a similar situation years ago. I tried numerous different things to remedy it and nothing worked. He escalated to yelling and threatening and cops were called a few times. A unit opened up in the complex and I jumped to move in. \nNTA", "NTA. He can\u2019t be that bothered by it if he makes an effort to actually get up and bang on his roof to make even more noise.", "I had issues with this too\u2026 my downstairs would complain about my footsteps (when I get up to use the washroom in the middle of the night) \n\nOnce he complained that my chair was rolling around too much (I was gaming) \n\nI was nice about the first two complains and tried to make as many accommodations for him as possible but after a certain point enough is enough.\n\nYour \u201cnoises\u201d are very ordinary and he honestly can\u2019t do anything about it. Just continue to live life as normal but remember to document the incidences. \n\nMy downstairs neighbour ended up moving \ud83e\udd23", "When he bangs, you stomp back. Only when he stops banging do you stop stomping. Do not feel bad, you are living your life, it's not your fault the old fart has his hearing aids turned to the max. Just because he bangs does not mean you need to try to be quieter. If you need to get up to go to work and shower you do that, ignore your bottom neighbour.", "Nta. He must have some mental health issues. My friend does this and he has severe ptsd. For some reason he took it like a personal attack like they were trying to annoy him. It's not your fault and he should get help.", "Do you have carpet? Often it's needed in old buildings with wood to put down carpets to muffle the sound.  But I did once have a paranoid neighbor who would sit awake all night and bang at the slightest sounds. She harassed all our building and they eventually asked her to leave.", "NTA, tell him this is harassement. I have the same neighbor except that we are not in an apartment but in semi-detached houses. She is constantly harassing me because she does not tolerate the slightest noise coming from my house. She asked me to stop using the stairs to go to my room.  Sure, when she explains me how to teleport or learn to fly, I won't put a foot on a step. In the meantime, she and her husband are the ones who organize parties until 4am with the bass blasting...", "Just bang back", "I dealt with this situation. This is the answer. Complain, repeatedly. Log every single time he does it. Try to get a recording of it. But complain over and over and over again to the landlord. File a police report for harassment.", "I am petty so I would scour the nearby town till I find a pair of wooden clogs. Next morning we would have an orchestra. Neighbour would quickly learn it can be worse"]}
