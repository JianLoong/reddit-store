We were deciding between moving to our second property for that duration or to rent another place while renting out that second place of ours. My wife's father insisted that we come over and stay with them so as not to waste unnecessary money on rent.\n\nI wasn't keen on that as my FIL due to a rather tense relationship. I'm not sure if he was always trying to talk me down or had insecurities of his own etc. When my wife and I started dating, he scoffed at my arts degree as useless etc. I ended up on a lucrative career and sold a co-owned start up, He then would made snide remarks about me being a show off because I drove a nice car, told my wife I definitely was selling drugs outside etc. \n\nSo anyhow, my wife convinced me that was all in the past and I agreed once I had assurances that our living habits did not clash with theirs. For one, I have a husky who I kept in a climate-controlled area at home as we live in a hot tropical climate. I offered to pay rent and that was rejected. My wife also confirmed they were ok with me leaving the AC on for my dog. The whole discussion was basically between my wife and him. \n\nSoon after moving in, my FIL either found out what I really meant or had a change of heart. He went on a rant about how wasteful it was to leave the AC on for my dog since it was just a dog etc. He was fine with us having the AC on when we were around but couldn't stand it being left on for my dog.\n\nI probably let slip of my tongue in my irritation and said the additional hour or 2 of AC being left on while we were out didn't cost much and I offered to pay that increase, if not our half of the utilities bill. FIL went on a tangent insisting this isn't about money and accused me of being a douchebag once I had money. He then stated that since we were living in his house, we should be grateful and live by their rules.\n\nI lost it and reminded him that it was him who insisted that we stay over and at no point did I ever request to move in as I could very well afford my own accommodation. I said we would move out ASAP. Wife and her father now are accusing me of being an AH and ungrateful.

It's about how much he hates you.\n\nHe hated you when you were a broke student and he hates you now for prospering\n\nI'm kinda surprised your wife thinks this will ever change", "NTA. It's fine if you wanted to keep the AC on for your dog. Especially if you offered to pay for it.\n\nHe sounds over controlling and unreasonable. Definitely would have moved myself", "NTA. You were forced into this situation so that you could be demeaned and your dog put in danger? No, bud. Just pack up yourself and the pup and find someplace else. Wife can join if she wants, but I'd be out of that place one way or another.", "NTA \n\nA husky is a cold weather dog. They do not tolerate hot weather well. You offered to pay rent, it was rejected. You offered to pay extra for the AC.", "NTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t ingratitude. Your FIL is a controlling AH, and your wife is co-signing it.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t stay. Wife can make her own choice.", "NTA. He's the one causing issues, not you. This isn't about you being ungrateful, he's trying to make you do something pretty awful to your dog just because he doesn't value pets like you do. \n\nYour dog is used to the air conditioning. If it's hot there, the dog quite literally needs it. He's just looking for a way to start issues. I would move out because I'm positive he will only cause issues between you and your wife at this rate. Plus, the dog doesn't deserve that.", "NTA - It's not \"just a dog.\" Animals are living creatures and as someone who also has a husky, leaving them in the heat can be dangerous. Why is your wife not understanding this? Does she also think it's \"just an animal?\" eesh. You also offered to pay the extra cost.", "NTA.\n\n>Wife and her father now are accusing me of being an AH and ungrateful.\n\nungrateful for what?  You already offered to pay or stay somewhere else.  What do they expect you to be grateful for?", "NTA\n\n- You were told you could keep the AC on for your dog so you did.\n\n- As soon as you found out it was an issue you offered to repay your FIL for the cost of running it\n\nI genuinely can't think of anything you could have done or do to be seen as an AH in this situation. It sounds like FIL was just trying to find a reason to belittle you.\n\nYour wife is also TA in this situation, she's the one who told you it was okay so she should have stepped up and told your FIL that it was her doing, something tells me if he thought it was your wife who did it he wouldn't have such a problem...", "NTA\n\nTake your dog and go.  Some adult children revert to old family dynamics when living with their parents again. I'd do no less for my pets, they are family.", "ESH\n\nYour FIL, obviously, a Husky is a cold weather breed, and can't handle tropical heat.\n\nBut you, for getting a Husky in a tropical climate!  Huskies can't handle tropical heat!  And Huskies are bred to run (and run and run and run) in a cold, snowy climate!  How can the Husky manage its running instincts when it has to be kept shut up in a room with AC all day!\n\nThe dog should be out in the snow practicing for the Iditarod, not locked up in a small air conditioned place. \n\nIn the future, find a dog that is a breed to handle your climate.", "You are NTA, but your FIL is. He persuaded your wife to move home so he could reestablish his influence over her and find opportunities to demean and criticize you and try to diminish you in your wife's eyes. And it would appear he's been at least partially successful in that, since your wife is siding with him. There's no reason you should be \"grateful\" for something you didn't want, didn't ask for, and is being used to undermine your marriage. If your 2nd place hasn't already been rented out, move there tomorrow. If it's already rented, find an apartment ASAP and get out of there while you still have a wife.", "NTA assuredly, somebody invites you in to stay, outside totally unreasonable behavior, and if you\u2019re up front on what you need, then it\u2019s on them to accept or reject and live with the consequences - however, think you unfortunately walked into this one. It\u2019s clear you have some particular demands on how you live your life and care for your dog that are fine but at least a mild variance from the norm, and there was already a seedbed of conflict with the FIL where ultimately yeah, conflict of some sort could likely have been anticipated and avoided. Sucks because it\u2019s extra out of your pocket, and doesn\u2019t justify his actions, but sometimes shacking up with family like this carries unseen costs.", "NTA \n\nI would get out of there ASAP. It\u2019s only going to get worse and with you wife on his side tell her she stay there with him and your out. \n\nThis man just simply hate you and that will never change.", "NTA. He seems like a man set in his ways. \n\nI will note there are cooling mats you can get for your dog to lay on. Some are wet.  We have one that isn\u2019t wet but feels cool when you lay on it. Not electric.  However for sure the doggo benefits from AC", "Nta....I've heard that huskies need to be in cold habitats and knowing how FIL I would have been like thanks but no thanks...wife is wrong for siding with her dad knowing how he is. She must in some way agree with his thought processs", "You are NTA. You even offered to pay for the extra cost plus even more and it was refused so you are not in the wrong here", "NTA. It cost more to turn off your AC when you are gone because then you use more energy at peak hours to cool off the house.    Reality aside, FIL agreed to your conditions and then called you a douchebag, for calling him on his breaking the agreement.  Your wife is an AH for not taking your side.", "No, you're NTA. Far from it.  \nIf you're FIL sounds exactly like mine, you'll soon recognize he's a narcissistic prick and anything you do is never good enough.  \nMy dogs are treated just like a member of the family and hell yeah we leave the AC on for him and he's a short hair. Tell you FIL to FO and find other accommodations.", "NTA\n\nPeople who say \"It's just a dog/cat/snake/rat/insert pet here\" gets immediately put on my do not talk to anymore list. Animals are a responsibility and FAMILY. If you can be criminally charged for mistreatment of an animal, then why are they \"just animals?\" Because they are living, breathing creatures.  Take the dog, leave the wife with daddy dearest. If she wants to come to her senses, then she can join you and the puppers in your own home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
