For me being an atheist in a Catholic Church made me feel like an impostor that is taking someone who actually wants to be there place.

I'm saying this so you don't trap yourself into a guilt sinkhole when you probably already feel really guilty about not following the religion your parents engraved into you. \n\nHeavenly father gave you freedom to choose.
