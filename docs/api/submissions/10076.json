So a week and a half ago (it was Friday afternoon), My water broke, I started having minor pains but I was familiar with the pain and immediately knew I was in labor, my due date was originally suppose to be Valentine\u2019s Day, but my baby had other plans. I told my husband I gotta go to the hospital, and he called my mom and asked her if she could pick up the kids, she of course said yes. She was originally suppose to take the kids on my due date.\n\nSo apparently, that weekend my sisters children had planned to stay the weekend with my mom because it was my sister and BIL anniversary and they booked a hotel for the weekend. My mom told my sister she couldn\u2019t have them tonight though, because she already had my children and there would be nowhere for her children to sleep. (There\u2019s a bedroom for the grandkids with bunk beds.) She even explained the situation, but apparently my sister was still unhappy. \n\nI spent longer in labor then I expected(16hours before I was even pushing) 11am our baby was born. Then we had to stay an extra night. My kids and mom came to visit me, and I didn\u2019t go on my phone till 6pm Sunday night.\n\nWhen I finally went on my phone, I had text from my sister saying I should\u2019ve called someone else because now she had to pay for a babysitter for the whole weekend, and how excited her kids were to go to grandmas.  She didn\u2019t ask about how the baby was or me. \n\nI didn\u2019t even know her kids planned to go to my moms till my mom told me my sister was upset when she visited Me. My mom just told me not to let her get to me, and that my sister was just being upset things didn\u2019t go her way. \n\nWell Friday night I found out my nieces had Covid so I texted my sister asking how they were doing and my sister responded back, \u201cWell now they have to miss grandmas again.\u201d She apparently has also been being rude with my mom saying how there was no way I was in labor that long and could\u2019ve stuck thru most the night with my kids, so my mom could have her kids a night and save money. My mom is telling me to ignore the things she saying but I feel bad, but I couldn\u2019t of known.
