But seriously, he needs to give them back, apologize, and then ask very politely if he can have one.", "NTA, maybe your wife doesn't want you to know that she sanctioned the taking.", "Before you ask for the rings back, be sure to confirm with your wife that he did not have her permission to take them. Maybe that is why she told you to let it be. NTA", "NTA. Brother trumps Uncle quite frankly. If it\u2019s truly all you have left. He needs to return them.", "Get the rings back and have a talk with your son. HE STOLE YOUR PROPERTY!!! That is never ok. Nta.", "NTA.  nah, you need to ask forthem back - god forbid he takes them to pawn for beer money.  ask for the rings back.", "NTA.  He took them without permission.  He needs to bring them back.", "any chance your wife told him he could take them? not saying it still isn't shitty - just maybe ask your son about it in a completely neutral way and see what he says, don't assume ill intent (he's your son, it will help a lot with your relationship going forward, even if he did steal them)", "NTA, he\u2019s 18. He should know better than to take something of value without asking", "So you can take things from someone without asking as long as you think they have sentimental value? NTA", "NTA. Of course you should bring it up! He took possessions without asking. If he wanted something to feel close to his uncle, he can ASK you for them. Or just ONE of them.\n\nEDIT: Don't know why your wife thinks this is okay, it's not. u/ReflectionBroad4009 had a good guess - maybe she told him he could take them. You need to have a conversation with her and see if this is the case.", "NTA\n\nFirst, it was wrong of your son to tale them when you have stored them away. Taking without asking is stealing, and your son should know better than to touch your things without permission even if he is your son. Sounds nasty, but would he like it if you went through his personal stuff?\n\nSecond, the rings mean something to you too. I think it\u2019s reasonable to ask for them back because that\u2019s all you have of your brother.", "Nta for wanting them back. Better judgement would if its for keepsake cause of missing home, get him custom family rings and ask for those back and trade him as a surprise but don\u2019t forget to mention why you wanted those back and the sentimental value. Communication is super key", "Nta the animals were his, the rings are yours. Get them back before he looses them and have a discussion with him about asking permission and not stealing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You can choose not to inflict consequences, but you have every right to demand the rings back. The argument of sentimentality is BS. Even if he was attached to the rings, why is his attachment worth more than yours? If he took an heirloom from your wife, I bet she'd feel equally betrayed.", "NTA. He should have asked.", "Not important. He stole them. Cut. Print. Go to commercials. His reasons mean Jack and shit. And Jack called out today. He could have asked. He didn't want to. Not a great way to start college life.", "NTA. He needs to respect your personal items. Where does he get off just stealing from you?! Geez, does he steal from friend's houses too? As his parent its your job to teach him to be a responsible adult. Just taking stuff you want without asking is not acceptable behavior.", "Ask for 1 back maybe? Let him keep one? \nNTA", "No you were correct. He stole them. He took something that didn\u2019t belong to him without permission. That would be theft.", "That's the correct word usage.
