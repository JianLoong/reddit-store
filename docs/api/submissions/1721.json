We have been married for 5 of those years. He has suffered horrific trauma at the hands of his dad. His parents were married and expecting twins when his mom suffered some kind of hemorrhage and she ended up with eclampsia. My husband's mom and twin sister did not make it. But my husband did after a period of time in the NICU. His dad told him it was his fault they died. He had grandparents who meant the world to him and tried to shield him from his dad's anger, but when he was 8 years old they died also. His father then blamed him. He spent the next 10 years hearing day after day that he was the reason. At no point did he have another person to reassure him it wasn't.\n\nWhen we met he had just started to heal. He was away from his dad and attending therapy. It was a very big fear of his that what his dad said was true.\n\nHe is a wonderful man and my nieces and nephew's adore him. He was always so good with them and the rest of my family.\n\nIn January 2020 I was pregnant and we went for a scan where we learned I had miscarried. As soon as my husband heard this, something inside of him broke. He started to unravel. He was in the middle of a mental health crisis. He was doing this weird manic laugh that was also a sob. He ran out of the room and I followed after him, concerned. My mom and sister both work at the hospital (sister's a nurse while mom worked in the little gift store). Both saw him in this worst moment. They saw as medical personnel were forced to intervene because he was in the middle of a breakdown, hysterical and totally out of it. He was totally broken and nothing could reach him. It was the scariest moment of my life. The worst moment of his.\n\nAnd they judged him for \"laughing\". Then when they told the rest of the adults in my family, they also judged him. All of my family were aware of his history. He told them about it years ago.\n\nMy husband ended up under the care of a psychiatrist who suggested he needed a lot more help than therapy could provide. Instead of understanding my family no longer wanted him around. They said a man who could laugh at his own wife's miscarriage was not the kind of man they wanted around the kids. I told them I would not leave him behind.\n\nMy niece is turning 12 this year and is having her first big party since Covid. She called and said she wanted us there but she hadn't seen us on her mom's list. I told her we wouldn't be able to come and that I was sorry, we both were. She was upset and asked why she never saw us. Why we wouldn't come to her birthday party. Why we missed them all now. I told her that my husband was not welcome by the other adults in the family anymore. She apparently yelled at her parents and mine. Then I got shit from them for telling her what I did. They said I had no business saying that.

My dad and brother were gone and my mom had a grand Mal seizure. Panic, turned to sobbing turned to hysterical laughing I suppose. Its not exactly an uncommon phenomenon and it doesn't make you the fucking Joker. People seem to use hysterical laughter to describe something funny when it's really hysteria, when you are so overwhelmed you cannot control it. What a joke that life would be this way is usually how I think about it these days. Ask each person individually what's the worst thing that ever happened to them.

I am so sorry for your loss OP and it was no one's fault, miscarriages sometimes happen without clear reason and I hope your husband has been able to process that. I also hope he has been able to process what his father did to him as the loss of his mother and sister were not his fault, could never be his fault. \n\nI hope you are able to someday teach your family how horrible they're being to the two of you.

Your family is horribly cruel and ignorant knowing his history. Your niece yelled at them because apparently at nearly 12 she is capable of compassion and smart enough to realize a psychotic break. Too bad the adults in that family apparently lack both intelligence and compassion. How is your husband now, if you don't mind my asking? I hope you two can heal together.

You did not tell them anything specific, which was the right thing to do. You must know that this is how guilty people act when faced with what they have done, and deep down I am sure you know that you are both SO MUCH BETTER OFF without these people in your lives. When your nieces and nephews are older, they can make the decision to come and look you up on their own.", "NTA\u2026I find it sad and scary that a nurse does not understand, that for some people, when grieving, they laugh instead of cry.

The company helps you after you're fired with resources and finding a new job and right after the poor woman told me this something just snapped inside me.

They have treated him all afternoon with the same kindness and dignity I've always recieved until the moment they learn of my condition. I generally avoid doctors now, but I started having chest pain last year and forced myself to go to a clinic. I nearly cried that day.
