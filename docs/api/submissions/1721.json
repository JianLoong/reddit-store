We have been married for 5 of those years. He has suffered horrific trauma at the hands of his dad. His parents were married and expecting twins when his mom suffered some kind of hemorrhage and she ended up with eclampsia. My husband's mom and twin sister did not make it. But my husband did after a period of time in the NICU. His dad told him it was his fault they died. He had grandparents who meant the world to him and tried to shield him from his dad's anger, but when he was 8 years old they died also. His father then blamed him. He spent the next 10 years hearing day after day that he was the reason. At no point did he have another person to reassure him it wasn't.\n\nWhen we met he had just started to heal. He was away from his dad and attending therapy. It was a very big fear of his that what his dad said was true.\n\nHe is a wonderful man and my nieces and nephew's adore him. He was always so good with them and the rest of my family.\n\nIn January 2020 I was pregnant and we went for a scan where we learned I had miscarried. As soon as my husband heard this, something inside of him broke. He started to unravel. He was in the middle of a mental health crisis. He was doing this weird manic laugh that was also a sob. He ran out of the room and I followed after him, concerned. My mom and sister both work at the hospital (sister's a nurse while mom worked in the little gift store). Both saw him in this worst moment. They saw as medical personnel were forced to intervene because he was in the middle of a breakdown, hysterical and totally out of it. He was totally broken and nothing could reach him. It was the scariest moment of my life. The worst moment of his.\n\nAnd they judged him for \"laughing\". Then when they told the rest of the adults in my family, they also judged him. All of my family were aware of his history. He told them about it years ago.\n\nMy husband ended up under the care of a psychiatrist who suggested he needed a lot more help than therapy could provide. Instead of understanding my family no longer wanted him around. They said a man who could laugh at his own wife's miscarriage was not the kind of man they wanted around the kids. I told them I would not leave him behind.\n\nMy niece is turning 12 this year and is having her first big party since Covid. She called and said she wanted us there but she hadn't seen us on her mom's list. I told her we wouldn't be able to come and that I was sorry, we both were. She was upset and asked why she never saw us. Why we wouldn't come to her birthday party. Why we missed them all now. I told her that my husband was not welcome by the other adults in the family anymore. She apparently yelled at her parents and mine. Then I got shit from them for telling her what I did. They said I had no business saying that.

My dad and brother were gone and my mom had a grand Mal seizure. Panic, turned to sobbing turned to hysterical laughing I suppose. Its not exactly an uncommon phenomenon and it doesn't make you the fucking Joker. People seem to use hysterical laughter to describe something funny when it's really hysteria, when you are so overwhelmed you cannot control it. What a joke that life would be this way is usually how I think about it these days. Ask each person individually what's the worst thing that ever happened to them.

I am so sorry for your loss OP and it was no one's fault, miscarriages sometimes happen without clear reason and I hope your husband has been able to process that. I also hope he has been able to process what his father did to him as the loss of his mother and sister were not his fault, could never be his fault. \n\nI hope you are able to someday teach your family how horrible they're being to the two of you.

Your family is horribly cruel and ignorant knowing his history. Your niece yelled at them because apparently at nearly 12 she is capable of compassion and smart enough to realize a psychotic break.

You did not tell them anything specific, which was the right thing to do. You must know that this is how guilty people act when faced with what they have done, and deep down I am sure you know that you are both SO MUCH BETTER OFF without these people in your lives. When you nieces and nephews are older, they can make the decision to come and look you up on their own.", "NTA\u2026I find it sad and scary that a nurse does not understand, that for some people, when grieving, they laugh instead of cry.

Okay, let's say she didn't... but then she's told it was and she still thinks he was laughing joy or funny haha sarcastic?  Even people without horrible trauma in their youth LAUGH at the worst moments because they are in shock and all that pent up emotion comes out anyway in laughter of the \"this is unbelievable\" kind.  A sensible person and surely a nurse would know this happens.

Personally I would send all the family a email or message on Facebook explaining the situation and how unfair they are treating your husband.  Let them know if they want to talk and work out the differences and everyone be a family. If not tell them unfortunately you will have to go no contact. Leave the ball in their court and you show you are trying.  I mean it seems so unfair how they are treating you.  Good luck!", "You told her the truth, that they are punishing him for having a mental crisis.  Hell, I usually laugh when I am most upset in a fight, but not because anything is funny.

Why should you keep their shitty behavior a secret?", "ESH.    \nPeople have a right to not want to be around the mentally ill for whatever reason.

Not theirs.  YOU brought an unknown wildcard into their lives and they are revoking consent.  This is their right.  \n\n\nYour niece asked, and MAYBE you told her the truth without spin, I'm not seeing you ACTUALLY told her the truth that he was under the care of a mental health professional, just a \"poor me\" type of answer.  I'm really surprised your family didn't get ahead of that.  That's why they suck too.  There were SO MANY lessons to be learned here about boundaries, consent, revocation of consent, choices, and owning those choices, along with how to weigh and balance what you want, what's in your best interests, and what other people want and their best interests.  You're not doing any of that either.  You aren't showing any empathy to the people that witnessed your husband's worst moment? i.e. not acknowledging their fear, their trauma, and have you even tried to ascertain if they have PTSD from that trauma?  Your mom may work at a hospital, but it's A GIFT SHOP.  Not acknowledging this very different nurse and gift shop experience, leads me to believe you're an unreliable narrator attempting to stack the deck in your favor, instead of Truth being paramount.    \n\n\nI wish you and your husband the best on your mental health journeys.  It's a marathon, not a sprint, and that's ok.", "Definitely NTA\nI come from a background of hypocritical racists on one side of my family who guilt me and my siblings for not keeping in contact while simultaneously never inviting us anywhere for anything, and hating my mother because she\u2019s the wrong color. They then tell their close friends and family when they ask where we are that my mother keeps us away. \nThese people can\u2019t be trusted. It\u2019s ugly and cruel that they would laugh at someone\u2019s pain like that especially in such a sensitive situation. \nHopefully, there will be an open and honest conversation in your future where you tell them about the hurt they caused, and the un truth they spread by I\u2019m inviting you and your husband. Perception tends to become reality, and without you there, only your family will get to answer when the questions of where are you and your husband come up. Good luck, hopefully this situation will clear if they let you shed some light.", "NTA ypu told the truth she is old enough to hear it.
