We have been married for 5 of those years. He has suffered horrific trauma at the hands of his dad. His parents were married and expecting twins when his mom suffered some kind of hemorrhage and she ended up with eclampsia. My husband's mom and twin sister did not make it. But my husband did after a period of time in the NICU. His dad told him it was his fault they died. He had grandparents who meant the world to him and tried to shield him from his dad's anger, but when he was 8 years old they died also. His father then blamed him. He spent the next 10 years hearing day after day that he was the reason. At no point did he have another person to reassure him it wasn't.\n\nWhen we met he had just started to heal. He was away from his dad and attending therapy. It was a very big fear of his that what his dad said was true.\n\nHe is a wonderful man and my nieces and nephew's adore him. He was always so good with them and the rest of my family.\n\nIn January 2020 I was pregnant and we went for a scan where we learned I had miscarried. As soon as my husband heard this, something inside of him broke. He started to unravel. He was in the middle of a mental health crisis. He was doing this weird manic laugh that was also a sob. He ran out of the room and I followed after him, concerned. My mom and sister both work at the hospital (sister's a nurse while mom worked in the little gift store). Both saw him in this worst moment. They saw as medical personnel were forced to intervene because he was in the middle of a breakdown, hysterical and totally out of it. He was totally broken and nothing could reach him. It was the scariest moment of my life. The worst moment of his.\n\nAnd they judged him for \"laughing\". Then when they told the rest of the adults in my family, they also judged him. All of my family were aware of his history. He told them about it years ago.\n\nMy husband ended up under the care of a psychiatrist who suggested he needed a lot more help than therapy could provide. Instead of understanding my family no longer wanted him around. They said a man who could laugh at his own wife's miscarriage was not the kind of man they wanted around the kids. I told them I would not leave him behind.\n\nMy niece is turning 12 this year and is having her first big party since Covid. She called and said she wanted us there but she hadn't seen us on her mom's list. I told her we wouldn't be able to come and that I was sorry, we both were. She was upset and asked why she never saw us. Why we wouldn't come to her birthday party. Why we missed them all now. I told her that my husband was not welcome by the other adults in the family anymore. She apparently yelled at her parents and mine. Then I got shit from them for telling her what I did. They said I had no business saying that.

My dad and brother were gone and my mom had a grand Mal seizure. Panic, turned to sobbing turned to hysterical laughing I suppose. Its not exactly an uncommon phenomenon and it doesn't make you the fucking Joker. People seem to use hysterical laughter to describe something funny when it's really hysteria, when you are so overwhelmed you cannot control it. What a joke that life would be this way is usually how I think about it these days. Ask each person individually what's the worst thing that ever happened to them.

Your family is horribly cruel and ignorant knowing his history. Your niece yelled at them because apparently at nearly 12 she is capable of compassion and smart enough to realize a psychotic break.

You must know that this is how guilty people act when faced with what they have done, and deep down I am sure you know that you are both SO MUCH BETTER OFF without these people in your lives. When you nieces and nephews are older, they can make the decision to come and look you up on their own.", "NTA\u2026I find it sad and scary that a nurse does not understand, that for some people, when grieving, they laugh instead of cry.

I have the advantage of working medical before mental health. In my hospital there\u2019s cooperation between psychiatric and medical.", "I hope they get to say with you instead of staying with your family members! Your family members need to learn that doing this to someone is just cruel!\n\nIt wasn\u2019t your husbands fault! He couldn\u2019t even understand how to react to the news of your miscarriage. Some people laugh, cry or completely have no emotion to terrible news(it could be all of the above). No one knows how they will react to terrible news. But I think that you should sue your sister for breaking the HIPAA law though. She should not be a nurse because she broke that.", "Have you thought about you and your husband inviting your niece out for a day to celebrate her birthday instead of going to the party?", "Not to mention this is the worst kind of violation that can happen, specifically where the business or employee should have known what they were doing was in violation, but willfully neglected HIPAA rules on PHI and did nothing to try to rectify the situation (obviously).  That's a fine for the business in question when the OCR comes calling due to a report, even if it's only $50K per violation to start.  If the person who violates HIPAA does it to multiple family members, that could be multiple violations and employees are the most expensive part of running any business, so making yourself more expensive to a business in a downturn probably isn't the smartest choice here and while I'm not sure it'd get them fired and/or in legal hot water, it could.  Either way it'd make life difficult for them, and in this instance, I'm not against it.  I also understand the law to say that you cannot sue a business (or a person) for violation of HIPAA if they're your employer, but otherwise it is possible.  That's what I remember, anyway, from training - perhaps I'm misremembering this though.", "I am always TA. I am good with that.\n\nHow exactly do you know he was not a danger to anyone? Medical intervention is not generally provided to people unless they are a danger to themselves or others.", "An orientation about bias is really different than bias being taught in statistics and touched on in every course for multiple years.", "I'm an ESL teacher and have had a fair few students from various medical fields from around the world. I've been absolutely shocked by the lack of critical thinking and mental rigidity of some of them. It's clearly very different circumstances, but I literally work with people every single day and I have done for quite a few years now... I'm not saying this based on their language skills, either.", "Yeah? \n\nFor your next trick, please explain where American nurses receive their virology and Youtube videography qualifications to denounce vaccines and spread preventable disease worldwide?", "Alzheimer's is definitely a mental illness because it effects the brain and it's ability to function fully and rationally. It just so happens we have soft-of identified a physical cause. Our Institute of Psychiatry has an entire senior care ward that mostly houses patients with Alzheimer's that have no other co-morbid medical conditions. Probably just a matter of semantics but I would consider chronic TBIs with defects in reasoning, impulse control, and decision make to be mental illnesses as well. I think we do a disservice to completely separate mind and brain. This dichotomy is part of what has lead to the stigma against mental illness.", ">They saw as medical personnel were forced to intervene because he was in the middle of a breakdown, hysterical and totally out of it. He was totally broken and nothing could reach him. It was the scariest moment of my life. The worst moment of his.", "Bull shit.", "Very true. I guess I just meant it as employers maybe are realizing there is bias in the workplace and are thinking they are doing something to change things.", "I\u2019m not denying that\u2019s how they may end up, but I wanted to set the record straight about what they are taught. \n\nI\u2019ve gained a lot of respect for nursing as a profession just seeing what nurses are expected to know and do.", "He was having a breakdown. In a hospital. Yes, it\u2019s scary to watch but I still don\u2019t see how he\u2019s now so untrustworthy that he can\u2019t go to family functions. OPs sister and mother are jerks. She\u2019s being nicer than me because I would block every single one of them.", "Which part is BS? If you are just being disruptive security will remove you. Medical intervention is not the first or even the second response to a breakdown."]}
