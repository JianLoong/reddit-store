We only have 1 son, 33M, who currently lives abroad and we see once a year, as it's very far away and expensive to go.\n\nWe live in a small town, he moved away when he was 18 for college and never came back. We expected him to move back after he graduated, but he decided to stay where he was, since he already had a job and a girlfriend there (they got married).\n\nOur town is close to our state\u2019s capital where his work field is very strong. Ever since his senior year in college I've been trying to convince him to move closer for a better career and to stay close to his family, he never showed interest, which I find it odd, specially since his wife also works on the same field.\n\n4 years ago, they moved abroad. I felt betrayed when he told me, he was already living 3 hours away from us, why would he choose to go even further to another country, but not the city right next to us?\n\nI never told anything besides let them know me and his father are always here if they needed us.\n\nUntil recently, things were \"fine\", I miss him a lot, we text everyday but we don't get to speak to each other often. The problem is my father (84M) whose health took a dive and is very fragile. And with my son living so far, he is missing a precious time he could be spending right here, his grandad is not likely to live many years now. I told the news to my son and he was sad about it, and he came to see us and left a week ago.\n\nI was honest with him, I said his grandfather will not stay with us for so long, and since he lives so far away, he will lose the opportunity to stay close  and enjoy the time he has left.\n\nHe was not happy about me touching this matter, he said I was trying to guilt him into moving back.\n\nI asked him why he was doing this to me, why doesn\u2019t he miss me and his dad? We are getting old and he is only seeing us once or twice a year. It\u2019s cruel to us.\n\nHe said he missed us, but he is happy where he is and does not plan on moving back, and he and his wife are already making plans on buying a house where they live.\n\nI couldn't take it and I burst out crying, I told him I felt abandoned, that he didn't seem to care for us and he should enjoy his family while he can because we will not be here forever.\n\nI asked what makes him think he cannot be happy living here, he didn't respond. The few days after this were very awkward and after he left, he seems to be even more distant, avoiding me and being very short on his texts.\n\nYesterday his wife called and said my son was feeling bad and told her what happened. She called me an AH and said I had no right trying to manipulate him like that, and I should be ashamed.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH for wanting my son closer to me, they are the AH for abandoning family behind. And I\u2019m including her as well, since she did the same (I talk to her mother often and she is on my side)\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t realize we could edit the original post, I just want to add some information.\n\n1. I\u2019m not asking my son to sell his happiness just to be by my side. I just can\u2019t see why he needed to be so far away, while he and his wife could have wonderful careers around our area.\n\nThey could earn more money while staying close to family, it\u2019s illogical for me to think about anything different.\n\n2. Some are under the impression I gave up my life to become his mother, and that\u2019s not true. I had my own career, and a good one. I worked hard to give my son the best I could. I retired 6 years ago.\n\n3. I realize the is a very strong cultural background where we come from. Family is expected to stay close, my son was the first member of my family that decided to move to somewhere so far away that makes visitations once every 2 weeks or even once a month impossible to do.\n\n4. I don\u2019t expect to be taken care of when I get old, me and my husband already talked about this, and unless my son wants to, we will not ask him to take care of us.\n\n5. Just to clarify, I am not Indian. While I love India and I've been there once with my husband, I just want to clarify I'm South American. My son currently lives in North America.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI think I'm getting it - it's really cultural.\n\nMost people here seem to be from the USA, and I understand it's really normal for families to be separated after children move to college, and they see each other just once a year at Christmas or Thanksgiving, for example.\n\nI was raised to believe family should stick together, I raised my son to have the same values, and I expected him to keep this tradition, but has broken it. It's not his fault but I will never understand this decision.\n\nEdit 3:\n\nThis will probably be the last time I'm editing the post.\n\nI realized that I will never understand my son's motivations to move away, and I will also never understand why he \"broke free\" from our culture of family closeness.\n\nNo, I am completely unable to see the world how he does, and I just have to accept it.\n\nI am still feeling abandoned, neglected and I'm resenting his decisions. I think he is ungrateful and I will probably rethink our will.\n\nThat said, I have to accept he adopted a new culture, and that is just who he is now. He changed. And I'm not able to change him back.\n\nSo I take the judgment, and I will work with what I have from now on.\n\nJust to add some extra info - I'm rethinking my will because, why should I leave everything for him, since he chose to be far away?\n\nHis cousins are all nearby and they help us when we need them, I'm closer to them now than I am to my son.\n\nI'm not taking him off the will, I'm just not going to leave everything to him. \n He gets to live where he wants, far away from us, and I get to choose whoever goes on my will.

He has a marriage, life and career in another country. He will never come back, and expecting him to move--for any reason at all--is just absurd. It's not \"cruel\" for a 33 year-old to have his own life. YTA, sadly.", "YTA\n\nYou were trying to emotionally manipulate him to move closer. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you move?", "You were manipulating him- sorry, no way to sugar coat this. Have you ever had a honest chat with him about why he moved away? Maybe the job is better there. Maybe he feels that his (future) children will have a better education or life in that country. Maybe the working environment in his previous job in your country was terrible and stressful. Maybe it was related to the home environment. You have not said about what the dynamics were when he lived in your country. The capital where he worked was close, but he lived 3 hours away. I am guessing this is more here you're not telling us.", "As someone who has moved far away from family and been through grandparents dying (and my father also), YTA.\n\nYour son needs to forge his own path in life, wherever that path may take him. You guilt tripping him into coming \"home\" is only going to push him further away. You need to understand that his home is somewhere else now. I get that it's difficult for you and it's not what you would have chosen, but it's not your life to live.", "YTA. \"He says I am guilt-tripping him\" and then the next thing you do is play mind games with him\n\n\"I asked him why he's doing this to me\"\n\nYou're right. Time is precious, but it's also his life and what decisions he makes are up to him. He will either be happy with his choices or live to regret them.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to control your son's life, his job, or where he chooses to live. You're a huge asshole for trying to make him feel guilty for living his life. \n\nStop trying to manipulate him. He doesn't want to live in his hometown. He has created a happy, successful life for himself and you should be proud of him. \n\nHe is where he wants to be and you are selfish because your own happiness is more important than his.\n\nYour username does not check out. You are the farthest thing from being a loving mom.", "YTA - he is enjoying his family while he can. Him and his wife sound like they have a lovely life together and are extremely happy where they live.it isn\u2019t fair to try to guilt and bully him to give all that up.", "YTA.\n\nYou're not entitled to see him and perhaps he's sick of you badgering him to move closer to you. He might also fear that you'll see him as a source of free care for your father. He does care about his grandfather, after all you admit he visited for a week. But he also has his own life and his own accomplishments, why can't you be happy for him instead of strutting around your empty nest, sulking and feeling sorry for yourself? Surely your husband is sick of this act?\n\nHe says you're trying to guilt him into moving back and he's correct. You wail about how cruel he is to you, how could he do this to you, and you use his ailing grandfather as a cudgel with which to try to beat him into submission. Were you my parent I would likely never return to you, so odious do I find your scheming.\n\nYou couldn't take him having his own independent life and you started crying. Oh no! Whatever. It's not cruel to you, you just need to grow up.\n\nYou keep demanding that he explain himself to you, and then you complain that he doesn't seem to want to talk to you and has become distant. Hmm, I wonder why that could be. Why don't you try ordering him around like a child again, I'm sure he'd be delighted to run back and be at your beck and call.\n\nChildren grow up and leave. It is the way of things. You are not owed their presence in your life. Your actions are only driving him further away. I suggest that if you want him to talk to you more then you begin by apologizing for your selfish actions. I also think that you need to build more of a life for yourself instead of trying to force him to entertain you.", "YTA. I get missing kids, but they aren\u2019t required to make their life decisions around what us parents want. They are their own person. And your behavior sounds quite manipulative. Why don\u2019t you move if you want to be closer?", "YTA. \n\nYour son has his own plans for his future and is living in a place he likes more. Sorry, there is no nice way of clearly describing this to you:\n\n1. To a lot of people, especially younger people, small towns just suck. There is little to do, pay is often pathetic and employees often treat employees as crap. In a big city, he has much more flexibility.\n\n2. He wants to live his own life without anyone using kin relationship to exert authority over him. Simply put, he does not want you to tell him what to do. He does not want to hear you complain that he is not having a kid. He does not want you to complain that he is going out with friends. He is making his own money and living his own life.\n\n3. You do not own him.", "YTA - You raised your son to be an independent, self-supporting, loving adult. You don\u2019t get to guilt trip him into moving closer to home with your tears and fears. Of course you miss him\u2026 that\u2019s understandable. But he\u2019s happy where he is! Be happy for him! You should be proud of him! Now go find some hobbies to do so you\u2019ll stay busy and let him be.\nBy the way, I\u2019m a Mom to a son AND daughter who both live and work in cities far from home. Yes, I miss them, but they are healthy, happy and thriving and that\u2019s what really matters!", "YTA. Your son's life does not revolve around you. He's not \"doing\" anything to you; he's living his life the way he sees fit just like most other adults. Just because he doesn't live close doesn't mean he doesn't miss you or care about you and it's not right to guilt him for that. The greatest thing you can go as his mom is be happy that HE is happy and thriving where he chooses to live. Love is not about proximity.", "YTA - he's an adult, he has found where he wants to live, he's married, and he's happy. You sound extremely manipulative. He's not doing anything \"to you\", he's living his life. If you miss him so much, move to where he's buying a house.", "YTA. Not for wanting your son to move back, or for expressing to him that you would like him to move back, but for refusing to honor his choice, and making his decision all about YOU and only you.", "YTA. My father did the exact same as you except without the crying and tears. I now have no contact with him nor do I want to. Sure I miss my family but I have my own life to live and children to raise and guess what I am my own person and have preferences to where I would like to live. Keep this up and you will not be a part of your future grandchildren lives, if they have kids. You use your father's failing health as a way to try and guilt him into moving home, there is a pretty good chance you will also try to use not seeing any future grandchildren as often as you want as a way to try and guilt him in to coming home. It's time to cut the cord.", "YTA. You are most definitely trying to guilt and manipulate your son into living near you. It sounds like he very much enjoys his life abroad and doesn't want to change anything about it. He came and visited you and his grandfather when you told him that his grandfather was very sick. He obviously cares about you and his family.\n\nWhy don't you want him to be happy?", "YTA. It\u2019s time to cut the cord on your son. He has his own family now, and it\u2019s not hard to see why he\u2019s chosen to be far from you. Your behavior was wildly manipulative and dramatic.", "YTA Something tells me that you weren\u2019t the best parents to your son growing up.", "YTA - your son owes you nothing, especially as you clearly are trying to emotionally manipulate him.", "yta\n\nyou sound extremely manipulative and controlling. stop guilting your son and let him live his life however he wants to, he doesnt owe you anything. your daughter in law was right.\n\nif you keep this up you will alienate your son even more.", "YTA he\u2019s entitled to live his own life. I get the vibe that you\u2019re overbearing and you treat him like he\u2019s a child. The more you push, the more he will push away.", "YTA You need to stop viewing his decisions to move away as personal attacks. You aren't the asshole for missing him and wishing he was closer, but you are for accusing him of abandoning you and the family when he is simply living his own life and paving his own path. If he is happy where he is, why would you want to take that from him?", "YTA. I\u2019m so sorry as a mother I understand how hard it is to let a child go. The best we can do is prepare our children for life and then let go of them so they can achieve the best things and help the world however they can. We cannot force them to stay. You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Someday he may encounter enough suffering to understand the precious time he has lost.", "You ARE the AH for being more worried about your feelings than his overall happiness and well being. YTA\n\nI bet you the reason he went silent when you asked him, 'why cant you be happy here?' Is most likley because of either the treatment he received as a child. Or maybe it was emotional neglect which is super common. Maybe theres some trauma somewhere that you probably dont even know about because you sound like you come from the group of people who laugh at those who say they are trying to have better mental health. \n\nThe only reason Im coming at you so harsh. Is because your making this about you, and your not even trying to see your ADULT sons perspective. He probably doesn't feel comfortable even trying to open up to you, youd take it personally and explode or try to blame him for you not being able to control your emotions. \n\nHe's a 33 yr old married adult. He can live as he pleases. You text everyday, thats huge! My mom lives 2 hours from me and we barley talk. Instead of being grateful for what you have your putting him in some box that he's selfish. \n\nWell isnt it selfish of you to want your son to give up everything he spent the past 15 years working for? \n\nIsnt it selfish that you want him to abandon anyone he knows. The connections hes made. Hobbies, friends, work camaraderie. All just so YOU can be happy because hes closer? \n\nLets say he does move closer. You gona get mad when he wants to spend Sundays with his wife and not you every weekend? You cant consume all his time and energy. Thats not fair. And frankly you should be ashamed of yourself. Good luck Op.", "Your son is an adult. He has made choices for whatever reasons. You may not like those choices, but that is your problem and not his. I suspect that given your descriptions of your behaviour, we can make reasonable guesses at why he\u2019s moved this far away.

Back the eff off or you never will see him again.", "Very gently, YTA. It is our job as parents to raise our children to be happy, successful people. It sounds like you have succeeded at that, congratulations!  It\u2019s his time to shine! I suspect you live in a culture where children are expected to stay close to their parents, but with all respect, that\u2019s not the way of the world anymore.", "YTA not how you feel but for trying to guilt him to stay you may realize it but that's what you were doing I can imagine it's hard for most parents not being able to see their kids all the time once they leave the nest but it's apart of life and you should be happy that he's doing well for himself and has a loving wife and is doing well for himself", "YTA.  You had a child.  That child grew up and made decisions about how he WANTS to live his life.  That's a GOOD thing.   It's not all about you.\n\n\nUntil 60yrs ago if someone moved away, odds are they would NEVER see their family again. And these days we have economy flights and Facetime!  This isn't really a big deal... you're just making it one for no good reason.\n\n\nBack off from your son and celebrate his choices.", "With all due respect, assuming none of you die from sudden events, he can reasonably be expected to outlive you. Therefore, maybe you and your father should move to his area so he will be happy with his location, his wife (and potential children), and his job/boss/coworkers. \n\nAt this point he has lived there for many years. it is not realistic to expect him to discard the life he has built and move back to where you live or where his wife's parents live. By making it a difficult topic, you are making him less likely to want to call and visit.  \n\nInfo: Do you think you can move past your disappointment and work with him to connect as much as possible? Do your credit cards earn you travel credits? Do you call and video-chat often? Do you have a set time planned to talk with each other? Can you make friends in his area who would like to visit your area? I have heard of people who swap houses for vacations with a friend and thus only have to pay for airfare and not hotels and restaurants. Good luck", "Ugh using dirty emotional tricks to try and manipulate him and guilt him into moving back.

Not for wanting your son to live closer, that's understandable, but YTA for the massive manipulative guilt trip. And yes, it's a guilt trip. When you bring up that he's going to miss time with his ailing grandfather and aging parents, when you accuse him of \"abandoning\" or \"not missing\" his parents, and when you assert that \"it's cruel\" of him or something that he's \"doing to you\"... all in order to make him feel guilty for not sacrificing his own adult life to live in perpetual anticipatory mourning, that's a guilt trip. He's an adult in his 30s, he has his own life and a wife, and you can't expect or demand that they both hold off on their independence and autonomy until you're out of the picture. He's clearly sad about his grandfather's health, and specifically YTA for piling onto his distress and weaponizing your own to use this emotional moment as a segue into pressuring him to make a major life change that he's already clearly declined. It makes perfect sense that he would be so much more distant after this interaction; he visits his family and learns of his grandfather's health, only for his mother to once again make it about how his visits are insufficient and his independence is a betrayal.", "For wanting? No. But you took it waaaaaaay too far. YTA", "YTA. There\u2019s a ton more to this story. There\u2019s definitely a reason your son does not want to live back to be near you. \n\nOtherwise, he would have moved back in a heartbeat.

You and your husband CHOSE to have him, so you had an OBLIGATION to feed and clothe him and care for him.  He doesn't owe you a life of servitude because of your choice to have him.

He's living his own life, stop trying to manipulate him into moving home because that's what YOU prefer!", "Alternate POV here, as a minority with (I think) a similar cultural mindset to where OP is coming from.\n\nIn my culture, our parents and grandparents do A LOT for us. They pay for school, pay for our first car, drive us to every school event/game, take care of  household chores so we can focus on school, give us money to go out with friends, pay our rent in uni, etc. We are effectively \"spoiled\" from that more real-word/real-life perspective (which comes with it's own set of problems when some struggle to become independent adults, but not the point of this post)\n\nAll that sacrifice on their part has been done with a very clear understanding that when the parents/grandparents are older, we will help them. Not necessarily that we're going to always be neighbours, but when things like sickness etc start coming around that we come back to help.\n\nIF this is that sort of situation, I can understand where OP is coming from/ why she would have this sort of expectation of her only son. That being said, OP, you didn't go about this in the right way. You should express your opinions/POV: i.e. told your son you miss him and that you need him home for XYZ reasons to help out.\n\nRe: the missing part - sucks, but you can't force him back. You WERE guilting him. You should have said you missed him and asked if he would be willing to visit more /  okay with you visiting him / learning how to use whatsapp / facetime video and communicate that way so at least you can see his face (helps with me and my parents since I live far away from them). You cannot force him to move back permanently, that is an unrealistic and unfair expectation. Also, small towns really can (sometimes) be awful places to spend your 20s/30s, from both career and recreational prespectives.\n\nRe: the XYZ reasons to help out - honestly it depends. If you're in a similar culture to mine, where you did those things for him, I can see where maybe there was potentially an expectation that'd he'd help you out. If that's the case, I think it's fair to say, hey son, we're really struggling with XYZ (doctors appointments, whatever). He may say okay, I'll come back to help out short term, or he may say okay, I'll hire someone to help you with XYZ things since I can't come back right now.\n\nWith how you handled it, OP, YTA. You very clearly attempted to guilt him into coming back. You should have shared your opinions/reasons, and worked together to find compromises. You may not be 100% happy with those compromises (i.e. it won't end in him moving back permanently) but at least you'll have some of your concerns addressed and hopefully work to build a stronger relationship with your son.\n\nI will warn that if every time you see him, you guilt him into coming back, the times you see him will grow fewer and fewer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: for those downvoting. I'm NOT saying that the cultural expectation is correct, I'm saying it exists, and that's why OP feels the way she does.

You are behaving childishly and selfishly.", "YTA\n\nWhile you are not an AH to want your son closer to you, you are one for how you are handling his choice to live where he wants to live. The more you try to push him into moving back home, the further you are actually pushing him away. Your actions are harming the relationship that you have with him. And even if you don't understand why he would would want to move away, you still should respect his choice. Just because you decided to remain close to family doesn't mean that he should have to. \n\nLook, I got two sons of my own who are very close to the age where they are going to want to spread their wings and move out of the house (and very likely the city we live in). Does it bum me out that they might choose to live states or countries away? Yes, it's going to be such a weird feeling not seeing them in person on a daily basis. But at the same time, I'm so excited for them to forge their own paths in life. Thank goodness for the technology that allows us to stay in touch!", "YTA.", "YTA.

They're amazing. I also don't see them often.  We don't talk every day and we wouldn't have if I lived closer either,  though we would definitely see each other more.  \n\nThey are not the reason I moved.  In fact,  they are the only reason I even go back to my country.  (Well and my friends) \n\nI have lived in that country for a long time.  So I KNOW I like the country I live in now a lot better, for me personally. That's not because my country is bad. It's just that my current one is a better fit for me. I'm a lot happier just being me. \n\nOf course I miss my family.  But I also know that moving back to where they live would make me unhappy. And they've seen it too. Both my brother and my mother told me I should not come back because they've never seen me so happy.  And to them,  that's more important than having me close all the time.  Because they love me.  And they know I love them too. \n\nYour son has lived in both places  so he KNOWS which he prefers.

If you had a kid and had the expectation that they will need to do what you want in order for you to be happy or there is something bad about them if they don\u2019t, you shouldn\u2019t have had kids. It\u2019s not fair to your children when they are made to feel guilty for not doing what you want them to. \n\nAlso, what about his wife? Does she want to move?

Notice how neither of them begged me to come running back across the country because I was too far away. Surprise, they understand I'm an adult with a new family of my own, minus kids. If my mom were constantly hounding me about how I did such a cruel thing leaving her behind, I'd probably stop talking to her entirely. I shouldn't feel guilty about being independent. She's allowed to miss me, but she understands that eventually you have to let go and let your kids live. He's a whole adult. Let him live.", "YTA. You are guilt tripping him.

The guilt trips ... aren't helping. \n\nOP, I've lived in a different country from my parents since 2014.  One of the reasons I had a desire to be so far away is that I had healing and growth to do away from my parents.  My parents are lovely people, truly, but there are/were some dynamics in the family that were unhealthy for me.  \n\nBeing further away has helped me be able to understand myself in the world, and shake off the family-defined version of me that I felt was inaccurate.

It doesn't seem like you're interested in supporting him in living his adult life unless it looks like the life that you personally approve of and imagine for *yourself*. I urge you to try to separate your needs and wants from your son's. They are different. He is not you, and has no obligation to behave as you would have.

However, your reasoning behind it appears to be: \"I gave everything to my son, now I'm only asking this in return\". From your own viewpoint, it can't be that much, especially when his work wouldn't be impacted that negatively. Let me tell you a story.\n\nMy father left my family when I was 3. I grew up without him, and only my mother. She became overprotective and overzealous, and focused her whole life on my brother and I. While my brother had meaningful interactions outside our bubble, I was bullied, shunned and ridiculed, making me more shut-in and more reliant on my mother's affection. She meant the best, but in her twisted views she kept belittling me and claiming my achievements were only made possible because she was there taking care of me, while at the same time limiting my interactions with friends and the outside world because \"this house isn't a hotel\", or the more toxic \"go live with your father, if you hate it so much here\" followed or preceded by \"my house, my rules\". I now *must* (for various reasons and an emotional manipulation I can't shake off) tend to her needs, and feel unable to move far away, but if I could, I would.\n\nMind you - she wasn't a bad mother, but she tried to suffocate me and keep me close to her so much that I felt chained and constantly judged and monitored. I was the instrument for her to live the life she wanted, and through which she could see the achievements she wasn't afforded to pursue. I'm now her only emotional support, and I hate her guts for it. I was brought on the brink of collapse and ghosted her for two weeks straight before telling her off and letting her know I wouldn't listen to her rants anymore, and now I'm looking for therapy.\n\nFar be it from me to tell you what your son is feeling, since your family dynamics look way better on paper than mine were, but this behaviour of yours feels entitled if not outright controlling. And please remember that your son may not like the idea of living close to you and see you often unannounced or having to help you on every task just because \"oh but you're right here, why can't you come by?\". Respect his boundaries. He may not be able to answer you why or he may not want to hurt you, but either way, your guilt-tripping hurts. And yes, it is guilt-tripping: your suffering is valid and understandable, but it's not his responsibility, and if you try to leverage your suffering to guide his choices, that's guilt-tripping.\n\nOne last note: your concept of family might not be the same as his. That's fine: accept it and respect his boundaries, and you'll still have a wonderful relationship with him. Understand that you failing to do so and trying to push your expectations onto him will eventually lead him to keep his distance from you.", "Ma\u2019am, your son is a grown man whose primary responsibility is to his wife and child.

(For reference my mom has lived in the same town her whole life). I learned quickly people only want to see you when you come home. Even living 2-3 hours away people rarely come to see you. So it doesn't matter how close you are unless you are <30 minutes from people.  \nI live across the country now and feel I'm in a much better place than if I had stayed home.

Just as I have to respect their choice for staying.  \nOf course death is hard (there have been 3 impactful deaths since the \"big\" move), missing events is hard, seeing how much people have aged 4 years later is hard, dealing with emergencies and situations is hard. But that doesn't mean I'm not happy with where my life currently is.  \n\nIf my family tried to guilt me into being closer or I tried to guilt them into following me, it would just create resentment and animosity.  \nWe all have to be happy with our own lives and be happy the people we love are happy. Even if we do all wish we were closer.  \n\nSo you have to respect his decisions, even if it's not what you personally would do. And just because you think he doesn't have feelings about missing you or not being around a grandparent, doesn't mean that's actually true. He came home and visited when you told him about the situation with said grandparent, which shows he cares. But you want to tell him that's not enough, and that's not fair.

So, Aunty, respectfully, YTA. \n\nYou should be proud that your son has grown up to be independent, a man who stands by his wife, with a good career and big life plans like buying a house. I'm sure you know some of your friends' children to be complete opposites - mummys' boys in their 30s-40s who run to their ma about everything, treat their wives like second best, don't contribute equally to the household, etc. \n\nThis is very foreign to our cultures, but your son does not owe you the rest of his life.

My mom also tries the whole \"I will die soon so you should spend all your vacation time with me\" tactic constantly (she is in perfect health).

It has been hard being so far away from family, but because they gave me freedom, I know I can go back whenever I want & they are there for me. I would bet that if you backed yourself off for a bit, stopped with the guilt trips, your son might be more willing to visit more often. You'll want that, especially when he starts having a family.

I COULD NOT WAIT to leave home and never come back. Joined the Army. Got calls all year long asking me to get out of the Army and come help her, always acting like a victim because she couldn't see her grandkids. When I was in my final years before retirement, she moved to within a mile of us and made our lives hell. There I was, 38 years old, two kids, same wife, house, swimming pool, cars, no debt and I'd been in a wartime Army for over 10 years, deployed for 4 of those years, and she's trying to treat me like I'm some errant 16 year old little boy. As soon as I retired, we moved to an area I knew she couldn't afford and I've never felt guilty for it for one single moment. \n\nChildren are supposed to move away, be happy, have their careers and family, and so on, and have supportive parents who are HAPPY for them. Not making demands of them. Both of our kids have had this kind of support from my wife and I so they come see us multiple times a year. We get invited to go see them multiple times a year and we do. Every family emergency, they've been here for us. We talk, text and video chat multiple times a week because my wife and I transitioned to more of a friendship/here if you need us relationship with them than the parental/teacher relationship. \n\nWe miss their presence constantly. My wife and I talk about that *between the two of us*! We will NEVER guilt our children because that is to burden them and USE them. \n\nBeing blood related doesn't give anyone the right to make demands of another.

You shouldnt have EVER tried to guilt him into moving back. Thats so selfish, especially as his mom. You should want him to live a happy and full life, even if its away from you, and try your best to video call and visit when you can. (Assuming you arent toxic, most parents that would guilt trip like this are, in some way. My gram has no boundaries and sees things that hurt her, as something being done to her. Like you did, \"why are you doing this to me?\" In response to a life decision someone else is making. She wants to visit and nobody that shes helped before had space for her to sleep, she took that a hige offense to her, and that they didnt care about her anymore. One of her siblings sold their house and she went on for weeks about how sad she was because theres so many memories there, how hard it is for her to lose the house. It wasnt even hers, its insane. Feel bad sure, but nobody did anything to you. \n\n\nThe rest of the comment i had typed to OP:\n\nY T A. My dad moved and his mom got sick a month later. She called me first, I moved in with her to help because she said she needed me. It was the most difficult year of my life, which is really sying something for me. Id never tell my gram that, of course. Since she knows about other horrible times in my life, and would feel terrible that caring for them was worse. \n\nMy grandfather died at home with my bf and i, whle my gram was recovering from a life altering (and saving) surgery. She almost died, but was resesutated. The next day was the day she found out.\n\nMy dad came to visit to support us when he passed, and then went home.\n\n3 months after my grandfather passed away, i gave birth. My dad video called. He visited when she was 3 months to see her and his mom. \n\nIve heard many of the things you said to your son, said to my dad by my grandma. Even more so (though understandably so) when she was fighting this cancer. I wanted him here too, so badly, and especially after having my own child. \n\nBut one day, when i still very pregnant, he asked me if he should come back. He could undo his job transfer that he had worked SO hard to qualify for, leave the place hes wanted to live in my entire life, leave the place that makes him happy, all because he felt bad because she was making him feel guilty.\n\nI told my dad, \"It'd obviously be nice to have you up here, and i miss you. But you deserve to be happy too. Dont come back here just for us, its your life too. You deserve to be happy, and she is awful for trying to guilt you into coming back, no matter how much she misses you. That isnt fair to you, at all. She will get used to it, its still fresh, and you can visit.\"\n\nWhen my baby was about 5 months old, i think, is when my dad came up and brought my gram with him. So now they all live there, and im alone with my small family. My dad drops hints sometimes that itd be cool for me to join them, but i never will. Ive always wanted to raise a family here. My gram is very torn, and always wants to see us. Shes always trying to ask of theres any way for us to come see her, trying to offer her room to us. We cant, but she brings it up every other week. \n\n\n\nThis was too long, but all to say. I 100% understand what it is like to have family in another state or country that you wish you could see more. You wanting to see them, would not ever justify uprooting his happiness and his life. What should matter most to you, is your sons happiness. If i read your post right, he spent 18 years where he grew up like we all have to. Then he went somewhere he chose, loved it, and lived there for 15 years, pretty much equal amounts of time when yoy favtor in the time he spent as a toddler where he didnt know enough to like ir dislike where he lives. \n\nHes had an entire life there, you dont mention if hes happy or not, but i assume he must be to want to syay there. And you still want him to be nearer to you.\n\nUnfortunately (for you) you're never going to be right, to ask your child to give up their happiness, and their life plans, to live closer to you. If you had wanted to be nearer to your son, and you were actually close, maybe youd consider moving to be near his family. Your son is movint forward, as he should. You're not, and you shouldnt be expected to. He can come back to visit and he does. (I havent seen my dad in person in over a year and a half now, i hope to surprise him later this year with one.)

My sister has two kids, 11 and 8, and four years ago sold her house and moved abroad. She's always had a contentious relationship with my parents, for other 1st gens out there, it's pretty standard stuff but my parents did this truly shocking thing--they learned and grew. \n\nI've stayed around. My parents are 68, signs of their aging, just little things (hand shakes, weaker vision) are starting to show. I'm 31. I might have kids some day but I'm far from ready or wanting to yet. I sometimes think about how my parents are more than parents, they are also a cultural anchor, they are generational memory, they are stories of a place and culture I carry (but woven in with Americanness), that I am racialized for here. I experience bigotry and isolation and also joy and grounding for/in my identities. \n\nI have done an immense amount of repair work with my parents and my therapy and their willingness to grow with me had meant everything to me. And it's mattered so much to me to cultivate a relationship with them as an adult. It's helped me and them heal. I also think about how my future kids may barely have an opportunity to know them, to have memories that they will hold and remember on their own. It crushes me. \n\nI feel envious and often hurt that my sister doesn't see enough value in her relationships with them to know them as whole adults, and to know herself as result (being multicultural without other familial ties is a whole mess, y'all). She doesn't visit often, she doesn't call or put the kids on the phone (my parents have spent years texting and calling, but after a decade, they match what she offers--they send gifts and call, don't think it's one sided). She is allowed to have her own value system. And i hope what she misses out on really isn't something she values, because, imo, OP is right--they aren't the kind of things she or her kids can get any other way. I couldn't and I will always want to know my grandparents, aunts and uncles who shaped my parents and therefore me. \n\nI'm so sorry to the OP who is born of her culture and the pain and differences that are born of having a child who is a third culture kid. It doesn't need to be a failing or cause for a rift. I hope you can find a way to express to your son why you think these memories and moments are so precious (it's easy to forget about mortality when you are yound and aren't confronted about it) without guilting him but from a place of loving and valuing, and find a way to visit more, him to you, you to him, half way in between--and if not, video calls, with you and grandpa. \n\nI don't know if this will help--but I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt that this isn't manipulation and struggle and grief over different values and a life turning out differently than imagined. \n\nUnpopular opinion but NTA.

My son currently lives in North America.\n\nAnswering this because if you're South American  your country's cultural background are likely very similar to mine, Mexico. We may even speak the same language. The use of state suggests you're Brazilian or Venezuelan.\n\nAs much as we would like to keep everyone we love together, the truth is that we just can't. Friends grow apart, relationships end and families move away. It's just nature. Our countries, any country in the Americas, were built on immigration, on people moving away from their birthplace to look for something else. Whether by war, poverty or simply a desire to have a better life, all of us have ancestors who left their hometowns, sometimes even their countries. \n\nWork isn't often the only motivation to move abroad and the longer we live away the hardest it is to return home. My family comes from Mexico City, while my uncle lives in a much smaller city. He could get a much more paying job here, but he's adamant that he will never come back to live here. Money isn't his only motivation. Have you ever thought that your son feels the same? Your state's capital may have better job opportunities, but it's not what your son wants.\n\nThe decision to live abroad was not made lightly. Everyone who moves abroad knows what it entails. Missing family functions and reunions is not always easy, but the hardest part is knowing that your time with relatives, specially older ones, is limited. You don't think about it all the time, but the fear of the dreaded call informing you that a relative has passed away is always there. \n\nYou are making your son feel bad because you want him close to you.

Let me guess, you'll be on the phone as soon as your will is changed to try to manipulate him that way.

Good luck ever seeing him again after that massively manipulative guilt trip you laid on him.", "YTA\n\n I love South America, been there quite a bit. I am also from the United States. There is relevant cultural differences (unless you live closer to the border of Mexico), and even in some hispanic/latino sub communities, having a tight knit family unit with 3 generations isn't unheard of - even here in the United States. \n\nThe issue is that your son found opportunities in the United States, and likely married someone from there, and is by all accounts (this is an assumption, but likely correct) an American citizen, and his children are being raised the same. While family is stressed here, it is usually separated by each generation as a \"nuclear family\", where as in central and south America, families are tied entirely together. \n\nThe thing you fail to recognize with tight-knit family units is the issue of individuality. People from tight-knit family units have an even harder time disassociating themselves as people from their family. There is also a LOT of co-dependency. Look at your communication - your son feels suffocated, and you continue to guilt him and try and find reasons WHY he shouldn't stay where he is - instead of asking him the important question - what does HE want? \n\nIt's easy to say he has the same opportunities in SA as in the US, but then again, I am not sure what industry he is in, or what country from SA he comes from originally to know exactly what kind of opportunities he's missing there or receiving here. So we are going to ignore those - especially since they have done nothing to sway him into reconsidering. \n\nYou haven't even considered the blow it may cause his career, financials, wife, and kids. If he were to move his family there, his kids would likely be in for a very hard time adjusting to the new culture. Its easy enough to tell a dog to sit or to stay, but telling a grown man to move back when he has other external factors to consider outside of you is self-obsessed and selfish. Especially when it sounds like his family has very little experience in SA or the culture there. That is just inviting them to be left out - which is the complete opposite of what you SHOULD want for them. \n\nAs for the extra info - your money is yours to do with, but you didn't need to tell us that information as it makes you seem petty and spiteful. The guilt trips you've given your son only further confirm your rather awful and narcissitic behavior - and so it's no wonder he doesn't want to move back. Look in the mirror before you try and guilt-trip your son into moving back, because you are likely one of the big reasons he doesn't want to.", "YTA. Get your nose out of his fucking business, jesus christ, you're being overbearing.\n\nHe's already texting you daily and sounds like he makes a lot of effort to keep in touch. \n\nHe has his own life, preferences, aspirations and choices.

It\u2019s his life, let him live it. \n\nThe comments about the Will, you\u2019re free to do what you want, but I\u2019d give it serious thought. Is that the last message you really want to send him? That you didn\u2019t approve of his choices and wanted to punish him for it. It will frame his memories of you whether he wants it to or not.
