We only have 1 son, 33M, who currently lives abroad and we see once a year, as it's very far away and expensive to go.\n\nWe live in a small town, he moved away when he was 18 for college and never came back. We expected him to move back after he graduated, but he decided to stay where he was, since he already had a job and a girlfriend there (they got married).\n\nOur town is close to our state\u2019s capital where his work field is very strong. Ever since his senior year in college I've been trying to convince him to move closer for a better career and to stay close to his family, he never showed interest, which I find it odd, specially since his wife also works on the same field.\n\n4 years ago, they moved abroad. I felt betrayed when he told me, he was already living 3 hours away from us, why would he choose to go even further to another country, but not the city right next to us?\n\nI never told anything besides let them know me and his father are always here if they needed us.\n\nUntil recently, things were \"fine\", I miss him a lot, we text everyday but we don't get to speak to each other often. The problem is my father (84M) whose health took a dive and is very fragile. And with my son living so far, he is missing a precious time he could be spending right here, his grandad is not likely to live many years now. I told the news to my son and he was sad about it, and he came to see us and left a week ago.\n\nI was honest with him, I said his grandfather will not stay with us for so long, and since he lives so far away, he will lose the opportunity to stay close  and enjoy the time he has left.\n\nHe was not happy about me touching this matter, he said I was trying to guilt him into moving back.\n\nI asked him why he was doing this to me, why doesn\u2019t he miss me and his dad? We are getting old and he is only seeing us once or twice a year. It\u2019s cruel to us.\n\nHe said he missed us, but he is happy where he is and does not plan on moving back, and he and his wife are already making plans on buying a house where they live.\n\nI couldn't take it and I burst out crying, I told him I felt abandoned, that he didn't seem to care for us and he should enjoy his family while he can because we will not be here forever.\n\nI asked what makes him think he cannot be happy living here, he didn't respond. The few days after this were very awkward and after he left, he seems to be even more distant, avoiding me and being very short on his texts.\n\nYesterday his wife called and said my son was feeling bad and told her what happened. She called me an AH and said I had no right trying to manipulate him like that, and I should be ashamed.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH for wanting my son closer to me, they are the AH for abandoning family behind.

He has a marriage, life and career in another country. He will never come back, and expecting him to move--for any reason at all--is just absurd. It's not \"cruel\" for a 33 year-old to have his own life. YTA, sadly.", "YTA\n\nYou were trying to emotionally manipulate him to move closer. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you move?", "You were manipulating him- sorry, no way to sugar coat this. Have you ever had a honest chat with him about why he moved away? Maybe the job is better there. Maybe he feels that his (future) children will have a better education or life in that country. Maybe the working environment in his previous job in your country was terrible and stressful. Maybe it was related to the home environment. You have not said about what the dynamics were when he lived in your country. The capital where he worked was close, but he lived 3 hours away. I am guessing this is more here you're not telling us.", "As someone who has moved far away from family and been through grandparents dying (and my father also), YTA.\n\nYour son needs to forge his own path in life, wherever that path may take him. You guilt tripping him into coming \"home\" is only going to push him further away. You need to understand that his home is somewhere else now. I get that it's difficult for you and it's not what you would have chosen, but it's not your life to live.", "YTA. \"He says I am guilt-tripping him\" and then the next thing you do is play mind games with him\n\n\"I asked him why he's doing this to me\"\n\nYou're right. Time is precious, but it's also his life and what decisions he makes are up to him. He will either be happy with his choices or live to regret them.", "YTA\n\nYou don't get to control your son's life, his job, or where he chooses to live. You're a huge asshole for trying to make him feel guilty for living his life. \n\nStop trying to manipulate him. He doesn't want to live in his hometown. He has created a happy, successful life for himself and you should be proud of him. \n\nHe is where he wants to be and you are selfish because your own happiness is more important than his.\n\nYour username does not check out. You are the farthest thing from being a loving mom.", "YTA - he is enjoying his family while he can. Him and his wife sound like they have a lovely life together and are extremely happy where they live.it isn\u2019t fair to try to guilt and bully him to give all that up.", "YTA.\n\nYou're not entitled to see him and perhaps he's sick of you badgering him to move closer to you. He might also fear that you'll see him as a source of free care for your father. He does care about his grandfather, after all you admit he visited for a week. But he also has his own life and his own accomplishments, why can't you be happy for him instead of strutting around your empty nest, sulking and feeling sorry for yourself? Surely your husband is sick of this act?\n\nHe says you're trying to guilt him into moving back and he's correct. You wail about how cruel he is to you, how could he do this to you, and you use his ailing grandfather as a cudgel with which to try to beat him into submission. Were you my parent I would likely never return to you, so odious do I find your scheming.\n\nYou couldn't take him having his own independent life and you started crying. Oh no! Whatever. It's not cruel to you, you just need to grow up.\n\nYou keep demanding that he explain himself to you, and then you complain that he doesn't seem to want to talk to you and has become distant. Hmm, I wonder why that could be. Why don't you try ordering him around like a child again, I'm sure he'd be delighted to run back and be at your beck and call.\n\nChildren grow up and leave. It is the way of things. You are not owed their presence in your life. Your actions are only driving him further away. I suggest that if you want him to talk to you more then you begin by apologizing for your selfish actions. I also think that you need to build more of a life for yourself instead of trying to force him to entertain you.", "YTA. I get missing kids, but they aren\u2019t required to make their life decisions around what us parents want. They are their own person. And your behavior sounds quite manipulative. Why don\u2019t you move if you want to be closer?", "YTA. \n\nYour son has his own plans for his future and is living in a place he likes more. Sorry, there is no nice way of clearly describing this to you:\n\n1. To a lot of people, especially younger people, small towns just suck. There is little to do, pay is often pathetic and employees often treat employees as crap. In a big city, he has much more flexibility.\n\n2. He wants to live his own life without anyone using kin relationship to exert authority over him. Simply put, he does not want you to tell him what to do. He does not want to hear you complain that he is not having a kid. He does not want you to complain that he is going out with friends. He is making his own money and living his own life.\n\n3. You do not own him.", "YTA - You raised your son to be an independent, self-supporting, loving adult. You don\u2019t get to guilt trip him into moving closer to home with your tears and fears. Of course you miss him\u2026 that\u2019s understandable. But he\u2019s happy where he is! Be happy for him! You should be proud of him! Now go find some hobbies to do so you\u2019ll stay busy and let him be.\nBy the way, I\u2019m a Mom to a son AND daughter who both live and work in cities far from home. Yes, I miss them, but they are healthy, happy and thriving and that\u2019s what really matters!", "YTA. Your son's life does not revolve around you. He's not \"doing\" anything to you; he's living his life the way he sees fit just like most other adults. Just because he doesn't live close doesn't mean he doesn't miss you or care about you and it's not right to guilt him for that. The greatest thing you can go as his mom is be happy that HE is happy and thriving where he chooses to live. Love is not about proximity.", "YTA - he's an adult, he has found where he wants to live, he's married, and he's happy. You sound extremely manipulative. He's not doing anything \"to you\", he's living his life. If you miss him so much, move to where he's buying a house.", "YTA. Not for wanting your son to move back, or for expressing to him that you would like him to move back, but for refusing to honor his choice, and making his decision all about YOU and only you.", "YTA. My father did the exact same as you except without the crying and tears. I now have no contact with him nor do I want to. Sure I miss my family but I have my own life to live and children to raise and guess what I am my own person and have preferences to where I would like to live. Keep this up and you will not be a part of your future grandchildren lives, if they have kids. You use your father's failing health as a way to try and guilt him into moving home, there is a pretty good chance you will also try to use not seeing any future grandchildren as often as you want as a way to try and guilt him in to coming home. It's time to cut the cord.", "YTA. You are most definitely trying to guilt and manipulate your son into living near you. It sounds like he very much enjoys his life abroad and doesn't want to change anything about it. He came and visited you and his grandfather when you told him that his grandfather was very sick. He obviously cares about you and his family.\n\nWhy don't you want him to be happy?", "YTA. It\u2019s time to cut the cord on your son. He has his own family now, and it\u2019s not hard to see why he\u2019s chosen to be far from you. Your behavior was wildly manipulative and dramatic.", "YTA Something tells me that you weren\u2019t the best parents to your son growing up.", "YTA - your son owes you nothing, especially as you clearly are trying to emotionally manipulate him.", "yta\n\nyou sound extremely manipulative and controlling. stop guilting your son and let him live his life however he wants to, he doesnt owe you anything. your daughter in law was right.\n\nif you keep this up you will alienate your son even more.", "YTA he\u2019s entitled to live his own life. I get the vibe that you\u2019re overbearing and you treat him like he\u2019s a child. The more you push, the more he will push away.", "YTA You need to stop viewing his decisions to move away as personal attacks. You aren't the asshole for missing him and wishing he was closer, but you are for accusing him of abandoning you and the family when he is simply living his own life and paving his own path. If he is happy where he is, why would you want to take that from him?", "YTA. I\u2019m so sorry as a mother I understand how hard it is to let a child go. The best we can do is prepare our children for life and then let go of them so they can achieve the best things and help the world however they can. We cannot force them to stay. You can lead a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Someday he may encounter enough suffering to understand the precious time he has lost.", "You ARE the AH for being more worried about your feelings than his overall happiness and well being. YTA\n\nI bet you the reason he went silent when you asked him, 'why cant you be happy here?' Is most likley because of either the treatment he received as a child. Or maybe it was emotional neglect which is super common. Maybe theres some trauma somewhere that you probably dont even know about because you sound like you come from the group of people who laugh at those who say they are trying to have better mental health. \n\nThe only reason Im coming at you so harsh. Is because your making this about you, and your not even trying to see your ADULT sons perspective. He probably doesn't feel comfortable even trying to open up to you, youd take it personally and explode or try to blame him for you not being able to control your emotions. \n\nHe's a 33 yr old married adult. He can live as he pleases. You text everyday, thats huge! My mom lives 2 hours from me and we barley talk. Instead of being grateful for what you have your putting him in some box that he's selfish. \n\nWell isnt it selfish of you to want your son to give up everything he spent the past 15 years working for? \n\nIsnt it selfish that you want him to abandon anyone he knows. The connections hes made. Hobbies, friends, work camaraderie. All just so YOU can be happy because hes closer? \n\nLets say he does move closer. You gona get mad when he wants to spend Sundays with his wife and not you every weekend? You cant consume all his time and energy. Thats not fair. And frankly you should be ashamed of yourself. Good luck Op.", "Your son is an adult. He has made choices for whatever reasons. You may not like those choices, but that is your problem and not his. I suspect that given your descriptions of your behaviour, we can make reasonable guesses at why he\u2019s moved this far away.

Back the eff off or you never will see him again.", "Very gently, YTA. It is our job as parents to raise our children to be happy, successful people. It sounds like you have succeeded at that, congratulations!  It\u2019s his time to shine! I suspect you live in a culture where children are expected to stay close to their parents, but with all respect, that\u2019s not the way of the world anymore.", "YTA not how you feel but for trying to guilt him to stay you may realize it but that's what you were doing I can imagine it's hard for most parents not being able to see their kids all the time once they leave the nest but it's apart of life and you should be happy that he's doing well for himself and has a loving wife and is doing well for himself", "YTA.  You had a child.  That child grew up and made decisions about how he WANTS to live his life.  That's a GOOD thing.   It's not all about you.\n\n\nUntil 60yrs ago if someone moved away, odds are they would NEVER see their family again. And these days we have economy flights and Facetime!  This isn't really a big deal... you're just making it one for no good reason.\n\n\nBack off from your son and celebrate his choices.", "With all due respect, assuming none of you die from sudden events, he can reasonably be expected to outlive you. Therefore, maybe you and your father should move to his area so he will be happy with his location, his wife (and potential children), and his job/boss/coworkers. \n\nAt this point he has lived there for many years. it is not realistic to expect him to discard the life he has built and move back to where you live or where his wife's parents live. By making it a difficult topic, you are making him less likely to want to call and visit.  \n\nInfo: Do you think you can move past your disappointment and work with him to connect as much as possible? Do your credit cards earn you travel credits? Do you call and video-chat often? Do you have a set time planned to talk with each other? Can you make friends in his area who would like to visit your area? I have heard of people who swap houses for vacations with a friend and thus only have to pay for airfare and not hotels and restaurants.

Not for wanting your son to live closer, that's understandable, but YTA for the massive manipulative guilt trip. And yes, it's a guilt trip. When you bring up that he's going to miss time with his ailing grandfather and aging parents, when you accuse him of \"abandoning\" or \"not missing\" his parents, and when you assert that \"it's cruel\" of him or something that he's \"doing to you\"... all in order to make him feel guilty for not sacrificing his own adult life to live in perpetual anticipatory mourning, that's a guilt trip. He's an adult in his 30s, he has his own life and a wife, and you can't expect or demand that they both hold off on their independence and autonomy until you're out of the picture. He's clearly sad about his grandfather's health, and specifically YTA for piling onto his distress and weaponizing your own to use this emotional moment as a segue into pressuring him to make a major life change that he's already clearly declined. It makes perfect sense that he would be so much more distant after this interaction; he visits his family and learns of his grandfather's health, only for his mother to once again make it about how his visits are insufficient and his independence is a betrayal.", "For wanting? No. But you took it waaaaaaay too far. YTA", "YTA. There\u2019s a ton more to this story. There\u2019s definitely a reason your son does not want to live back to be near you. \n\nOtherwise, he would have moved back in a heartbeat.

You and your husband CHOSE to have him, so you had an OBLIGATION to feed and clothe him and care for him.  He doesn't owe you a life of servitude because of your choice to have him.

They pay for school, pay for our first car, drive us to every school event/game, take care of  household chores so we can focus on school, give us money to go out with friends, pay our rent in uni, etc. We are effectively \"spoiled\" from that more real-word/real-life perspective (which comes with it's own set of problems when some struggle to become independent adults, but not the point of this post)  \n\nAll that sacrifice on their part has been done with a very clear understanding that when the parents/grandparents are older, we will help them. Not necessarily that we're going to always be neighbours, but when things like sickness etc start coming around that we come back to help. \n\nIF this is that sort of situation, I can understand where OP is coming from/ why she would have this sort of expectation of her only son. That being said, OP, you didn't go about this in the right way. You should express your opinions/POV: i.e. told your son you miss him and that you need him home for XYZ reasons to help out. \n\nRe: the missing part - sucks, but you can't force him back. You WERE guilting him. You should have said you missed him and asked if he would be willing to visit more /  okay with you visiting him / learning how to use whatsapp / facetime video and communicate that way so at least you can see his face (helps with me and my parents since I live far away from them). You cannot force him to move back permanently, that is an unrealistic and unfair expectation. Also, small towns really can (sometimes) be awful places to spend your 20s/30s, from both career and recreational prespectives.\n\nRe: the XYZ reasons to help out - honestly it depends. If you're in a similar culture to mine, where you did those things for him, I can see where maybe there was potentially an expectation that'd he'd help you out. If that's the case, I think it's fair to say, hey son, we're really struggling with XYZ (doctors appointments, whatever). He may say okay, I'll come back to help out short term, or he may say okay, I'll hire someone to help you with XYZ things since I can't come back right now. \n\nWith how you handled it, OP, YTA. You very clearly attempted to guilt him into coming back. You should have shared your opinions/reasons, and worked together to find compromises.

You have succeeded as a parent it seems; a grown son, good education, good job, wife, happy family of his own. It's normal to miss him and want to see him more, but the guilting him into moving home everytime you talk will only drive him further away.

Asking him to completely uproot his life just so you can have him closer is pretty selfish, and resorting to emotional manipulation in an effort to get him to do that is dirty pool.  Keeping that up sounds like a good way to eventually provoke your son into going NC & not having you be relevant to any children they may have.  (And as a further aside, it is interesting that both your son & his wife have moved farther & farther away, and went silent when you asked him why he couldn't be happy living close to where you are- kind of makes one wonder if there's some missing missing reasons kind of thing at play here....)", "You're a desi parent aren't you?", "YTA. \n\nYour job as a parent was to raise up a kid to be a fully competent adult.

It\u2019s absolutely disgusting and isn\u2019t going to make him want to move close to you. My mother does the same damn thing and all it makes me want to do is leave and never visit again. Make friends. Get a hobby. Stop manipulating your son into moving closer to you because all that\u2019s going to do is make him resent you. And for God\u2019s sake, it\u2019s not all about you.
