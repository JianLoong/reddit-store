So I planned that, but in getting the boys out the door, I neglected to bring my wallet for the bfast burittos, and we were a couple blocks away, so she volunteered to pay for them and I could just pay her back.

So it's not like she asked you to put in tonnes of effort to find and get the exact item she wanted, your outgoing thought and effort here were effectively 0 thanks to your wife's wishes. \n\nYou also said that once these are returned she's likely just going to buy herself a different coat so really you haven't gotten her anything, you've just briefly been a middle man in her online shop. Again i acknowledge that this is what she asked for, but i think you need to acknowledge the incredibly low effort she had asked for up to this point. \n\nThen on the day you forgot your wallet and one of the activities (no one's fault) was a bust. It sounds like her mothers day was her buying breakfast and a family beach day. Which again, so little actual effort required from you.\n\nI'd return the coats for her simply because i can't see anywhere else on mothers day she asked for or received any actual thought or effort from you.

On top of that your wife commented that this is nothing new and that you don't pull through on your plans. Im pretty sure that youre wife is the one that saves the day when this happens every single time. This means that she has to pick up the slack from you.

If the reason is something entirely to do with the recipient or something you can't reasonably have been expected to anticipate, then if they want it changed they should do it. That is what appears to be the case here. If you were just sending back the one coat that wasn't the right size, yeah you should do that, since you did essentially agree to that when she said she didn't know what size and asked you to get two. But since she asked for this exact coat and then *changed her mind* that is entirely a her problem. You were more than reasonable in ordering the item she wanted in two separate sizes which I already think is somewhat whack - check the size charts against your measurements and if it doesn't fit ask to exchange - you don't ask someone to spend twice as much just 'cause you don't know what size to get, damn.

It is a de facto family acct. There is nothing extra involved in her returning the items.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s weird. He asked the kids what they wanted to do as a plan for the day with their mom. We did similar things when I was a kid. The kids \u201cplan\u201d the day and surprise the mom with it. Mother\u2019s Day was always more about us doing something for our mom than it was about our dad iirc.", "She would be pissed if I asked her, she woukd consider that shifting the emotional burden to her.", "Would you be peeved if you offered to pay rather than drive back home? We were a couple blocks away when I realized.\n\nI didn't realize it would bother her. It's not optimal, but obv I pay for it in the end when I pay her back for it. \n\nRe: planning the activity, she's their mother, it seemed natural to ask what sort of activity they would like to do to celebrate their mother. Our eldest picked that bc it is something they have done together. I added a hike to it  bc I thought she would enjoy that + the flowers. But she didn't want to do the flowers that day, she wanted to go when it is less crowded. And we are doing the hike next week, ehen we can get a sitter for the kids who can't walk so far. \n\nThe kids are 5 and under, she enjoys the going to beach, didn't seem to crazy at the time.", "Help me understand, what's the issue there?", "Generally the rule is that you ask the mother what SHE wants to do for mother's day since it is her day. I think you get points for trying but next year, she should pick how she wants to spend the day. Many mom's wnat to spend it alone relaxing and not with their kids.", "I appreciate the clarification. I'll change my judgement to NAH. She probably should be responsible for returning it, but it'd be a nice gesture to return it for her since the gift itself didn't work out.\n\nBy the way, Doordash in my city let's you have someone come and pick a package up for you. If that's an option for you guys, maybe you should try it if this return is causing so much stress lol.", "it's right there in the name of the day brother", "Well, for one: that you sought advice from small children for your kind gesture for your partner, and two, you couldn\u2019t manage to implement the small children\u2019s simple idea without difficulty. \n\nThen came here to complain about how she complained about low effort.", "Fair enough, thank you. Again, sorry for the confusion!", "But she did ask for 2 coats, right? And you just assumed she\u2019d be returning one of them\u2026she didn\u2019t say \u201cOrder two and I\u2019ll keep the one I like the most.\u201d\n\nThe reason I asked that is because I have ordered 2 coats when I catch them on sale for myself, as well as my 2 sons\u20261 coat that\u2019s more casual and durable (to wear shopping, to go outside, etc., and the second one a little nicer, to wear to church, or other more specific occasions.", "I asked what they wanted to do bc she is their mother, and I thought they should have a say. \n\nHonestly, I have always considered Mother's Day as being more for children to appreciate their mother. Naturally my kids are too young to do that, so I step in, so I am prob just behind the times. I didn't have a father who did such things growing up, maybe I never properly understood what Mother's Day is about.", "Sorry, I made the correction.", "Congratulations. You gave your wife the gift of errands for mother's day. And she bought your breakfast because you had your head up your ass. Again. Are you quite sure you're a fully functioning adult? Sounds like you're just the 3rd child in this family. \n \nYta", "YTA \n\nUgh. The gift recipient is your wife not a coworker or random Cousin. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a good look, stop being a dick.", "ESH. You're right that it should normally be the recipient's responsibility to return a gift, but it was a Mother's Day present and you two live together. It takes like 5 minutes to return something to Amazon. You're picking such a goofy hill to die on.", "Returns on an Amazon Prime account are really easy. They have many sites where one can simply drop off the return. No address labels, no repackaging. You would have to initiate the return online but then she can drop it off. Easy Peasy.", "Y\u2019all need to learn to pick your battles", "YTA because it\u2019s your wife on Mother\u2019s Day and not a regular gift situation", "NTA. Receivers would have to give the gift back to the giver and then giver would have to return it, choose new gift, and then gift again?? No. Not how it works. Once you receive a gift, it's yours to handle however you wish. She wanted them returned, she returns them.", "It's not tricky with Amazon - you can buy things as gifts with gift receipts as anything else", "If you read into the comments you\u2019ll see why he\u2019s the AH", "Silly. I obv paid back for the breakfast, bought her flowers, a book she'll enjoy, two coats, made separate plans next week for a proper hike she'll enjoy, plan ed a family morning at the beach, which is one of her favorite places. And I'm returning the coats. You are taking other things you do not like about what I've said and inserting into the question. \n\nYes, I forgot my wallet while getting the kids dressed and fighting to get them in the car. Clearly that ruined the whole day, and I'm a child, as you say.", "Oh, I will do it. But the fact that she assumed I would and then insulted me when I suggested she could handle that felt entitled.", "I don\u2019t understand who someone down voted this. What am I missing? This post is a good explanation. I also thinks it clears up any misconception his original post may have conveyed. This is perfectly reasonable\u2026To me.", "You're the one that laughed at her response. Isn't that insulting to her? You're only thinking about how things affect you and not how they affect her. You already burdened her with her paying for her own mother's day meal (paying her back after the fact doesn't make it any better) and now you're adding to her plate by giving her more work to do of returning the gift she didn't like. How hard is it to say, \"sure sweetheart I'll do that for you,\" and then do it for her so she actually feels taken care of.", "OP, I agree with you. I suspect a good bit of this online debate is related to how folks were raised. There are cultural aspects to how one gives and receives gifts, but frankly, I never appreciated how complicated it could be.", "I never forget. Plans get executed, I just forgot my wallet. And would have preferred grabbing it so this isn't thrown in my face when she laundry lists me. \n\nHonestly, I think the issue here is that I never really thought of it as a day to show appreciation to her as a mother. I always thought of Mother's Day as a day to appreciate your mom. That's something I'm taking from this thread though, I need to think that way. \n\nIt feels shitty having everything I do to keep the house going being brushed off like it doesn't matter. I took a job from home so she could leave the home and work. I clean daily. I handle the kids more. I make sure the entire house gets cleaned and the laundry gets done before the weekend even starts so we have less to worry about. Just I don't complain about how much I do bc I don't mind doing it, so it doesn't get credited, while with her I feel like part of this is bc I am male, so my contributions are assumed to be lesser. Male contributions to the home always seem so easy for people to dismiss. \n\nAnyhow, thank you for the comments and the luck! Sounds like I need it! \n:-)", "Yes I would be peeved if I offered rather than drive back home. At that point you\u2019re just one more kid in tow to take care of.", "Generally, when kids are too young to make good decisions or great plans the father or husband decides the activities BASED ON WHAT HE KNOWS THE MOTHER WOULD APPRECIATE already and guides the kids into those plans. Small gifts or activities based on the kid\u2019s original ideas are add-ons to the plan, *not the whole plan.*\n\nYou should know things that would make her happy. You should ask BY SUGGESTING plans well ahead of time if you don\u2019t quite know what to do. Don\u2019t ask her what she wants to do. That\u2019s putting the onus on her. Propose 3 things and ask if one sound good. That\u2019s you doing the thinking labor, showing that you known her, and allowing her to do what she wants.", "So, a gift should never be a chore. Sometimes gifts are unwanted and normally I\u2019d expect the recipient to handle it. However given that a) this was designed for at least one return to be necessary and b) you\u2019re a couple who live together, it\u2019s very reasonable to expect you to handle the return.", "She did, but diff sizes. It was understood thus was to make sure we got one that fit.", "Mothers Day is for *you* to teach your kids on how to appreciate their mother. You say, \"Tomorrow is mommy's day and she likes lilacs, so me and you are going to the store to pick out lilac flowers. She likes chocolate cake with coconut icing, so we are getting that cake and mommy gets the biggest slice. And then we are all going to make her cards with crayons and tell her how much we love and appreciate the things mommy does as a mommy.\"\n\nYou let them pick out which bundle of lilacs, what to write on the cake and what to put in the card, but *you* direct the activities.", "That literally makes no sense at all. Your wife is the one who birthed those children and is raising them along side of you. The day is MOTHER\u2019S day. Not \u201cchildren\u2019s day\u201d. It\u2019s about HER, just like Father\u2019s Day is about YOU. YTA absolutely.", "[removed]", "I hear you. I've legit never really thought of it that way. But that wasn't the AITA question, this \nis more a side discussion.\n\nWhat can I say, I have a mother, I bring flowers and a gift, visit for a few hours, we are good. I do much more for my partner, I suck. It's weird to me. \n\nAnd let's be serious, the only thing I get for Father's Day is a card, some little gift, and her taking the kids for a couple hours. I do more for her every year. So maybe we're both AH's, idk.", "Yeah, but I'm honest about it. I'm taking in what is being said, and doing my best to learn from what is being said.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Do you really think the two are comparable?", "It\u2019s a start. Just remember, until the kids have actual good ideas and can make thorough plans (we\u2019re talking ages 10 and up likely), the onus is on you. Usually it\u2019s expected for a father/partner to  appreciate the mother of the children in the day too (even if they are step children). Hell I even call my grandparents to wish them happy Mother/Father\u2019s Day."]}
