It is the gift recipients job to do returns.\n\nHowever, online shopping is this tricky. Especially with Amazon purchases because the return won\u2019t be going back to a Family account or her account, it\u2019s going back to your account specifically. \n\nIf you want to ensure you have the money returned to you, Id just suck it up and do it. But she\u2019s acting like TA expecting a gift, and two sizes, nonetheless, and then expecting you to mess with the return as well.\n\nOverall- NTA", "NAH. You are in the same house. You have the same account.\n\nIn recieving gifts from people outside the nuclear family, yes the recipient does return any items. But that's because it would be rude to basically hand it back and say 'oh no thank you and please just return it yourself.'\n\nBut this is inside your home so it doesnt matter. My momma always handled returns, no matter if she was the giver or recipient. Or if it was daddy or us kids. She just took care of it with other errands.", "INFO: Weren't you expecting to have to return at least 1 of them?", "NTA: When I receive a gift I say \"Thank You\". If I decide to return it's that's my responsibility. I received the gift & it is now mine to do with as I wish. Who demands that the gift-giver also provides \"returns\"? No, that's not how gifting works!", "NTA  If the recipient doesn't like it, it's their choice to either regift it, return it, or toss it.  This is there new chore, not yours.", "NTA. \nI would do the same and feel the same way. I might be A H though?", "NTA.  I graciously accept any gift someone is kind enough to think about and gift me.  If a return or exchange needs to be made, it\u2019s mine to take care of.\nI imagine you would have been much more likely to return them if you were politely asked rather then told with an air of entitlement.", "NTA and your logic of \u201crecipient returns gift if they don\u2019t like it\u201d isn\u2019t wrong. However, this is your wife, mother of your children, and this was a Mother\u2019s Day gift. It would\u2019ve probably meant more to your wife for you to return the coats with no complaint, than to come back at her like you did. Are you wrong? No. Is this an opportunity to show your wife you\u2019ll go that extra mile for her? It is. Sometimes we do things that inconvenience us for the people we love, just because we love them.", "NTA that attitude sounds really awful and it would be the last gidti gave that person.\n\nI used to know this guy who would buy his wife the nicest gifts and she would always make him return them because she didn't want it. I always thought it was Maybe it's because I have never had someone in my life who thoughtful like that but all I could think each time was if someone gifted me that I'd have accepted it in a heartbeat. They were always nice lavish gifts, they were well off and could afford them she just didn't want them and that's fine no shade to her. I just wished someone would give me nice gifts like that lol", "In this case yta because you know when you ordered you'd have to return one.  \n\nIs this really a big deal?  You just go drop it off?", "NTA, but not being nice either...Do you normally handle returns for the amazon account?  How much work is it going to be?  Wouldn't it be nice if you just handled it for them???", "From all the YTA, maybe I\u2019m crazy but I read the post and NTA. She asked for two coats in two sizes. This was a her thing and you did EXACTLY AS SHE ASKED! You were totally awesome. Maybe it\u2019s me but if I asked for two bc I knew one would need to be returned for fit purposes that\u2019s ON ME! Even if it is a gift. That\u2019s why you give gift receipts. Bc once the gift is given it\u2019s up to the receiver to do with what they want. It\u2019s not up to you to return it bc she didn\u2019t like what SHE ASKED for. Now if you would\u2019ve not gotten her what she asked for then yeah dude, ywbta. You did exactly what she wanted, just bc she ended up not being happy with it doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t be grateful and that it should fall on you to handle.

Fourth Amazon is INSANE to return stuff to unless you bought it\u2014trust, i tried with baby shower crap, and it literally never worked.

When the coat is returned, the cost of coat will go to you, not her. The protocol is as such because a non-Amazon return would render cash/store credit on the returner. Here thats you, ergo as the only one with an incentive to return, you should.\n\nThis is hard cause you did the amazing non-AH of buying both sizes. Protocol says you buy 1 and they can return for different size. Hoisted by your own well meaning petard as it were.", "NTA. It is the gift recipient's job to deal with the present. Only thing you're supposed to do is provide the things necessary to facilitate that return. She has access to your Amazon account. It takes a minute to initiate the return. All she has to do is drop it off. Hell, she can schedule a pickup and pay a small fee of she doesn't want to leave the house (your card would get charged). There's absolutely no reason for her inability to return the item. She's just being lazy.", "Lol YTA. Stop being so petty.", "ESH you are correct about, once you give something to someone it's theirs (meaning not yours anymore) to do with what they please.  \n\nYour mistake was buying the two coats because you already knew one would have to be returned.   \n\nYou agreed, now you return it.", "Yta.

It's kind of annoying that she ended up not wanting either but wouldn't you rather have her have something she wants rather than have wasted money. \nI can see it being very frustrating when a gift becomes a chore and there is someone who is right there and can take on the task.", "Yta great, so your gift was a chore. How thoughtful.", "YTA - you\u2019re being petty. You bought multiple items, you knew one would have to go back.

If all you did was order it and have her open the package, then this is more than about a return and makes you the asshole.", "if it is bought in a physical store, maybe? but this is Amazon so your account needs to process the return. think of the logistics how would someone else achieve that. this feels like either n a h or e s h", "Nta.

That\u2019s with a brick and mortar store, though.\n\nWith a family purchase in the same household with the same Prime account, all the info is available to both partners.

The bigger question is, why are you treating your relationship so transactionally instead of being a true, caring partner?

No. She asked for two, I naturally (wrongly?) assumed she would just return one.", "TBH, when she asked for me to gift her two coats to make certain of the fit, I assumed she would be returning the one that didn't. \n\nAt any rate, I was informed this is consistent with my personality, that I half-ass things like Mother's Day, like I asked our children what they wanted to do, they said bfast at the beach, and then go see the bloom of flowers we have right now from all the rain earlier this year. So I planned that, but in getting the boys out the door, I neglected to bring my wallet for the bfast burittos, and we were a couple blocks away, so she volunteered to pay for them and I could just pay her back. Which she mentioned this a.m. as typical of me (I do forget things sometimes, and we have two young boys, ai am often more focused on getting them out the door than making sure I have everything I need, which is obv bad). So I guess I should've insisted we go back. Or better yet, not forgotten it in the first place.\n\nAnd then there were too many other people for her to want to go see the flowers, so that was a fail as an idea too, so we just wound up going to the beach to eat with our kids, messed around in the ocean, and I made arrangements for my parents to watch our boys this Sat so we can go for a hike, just the two of us (she really enjoys hiking, hard to do with 2 toddlers tho, they don't make it very far). She didn't mention the flowers I bought her, I think those were ok.\n\nSo if IATA, then I guess I better step it up.", "lol this is a terrible take\n\nshe got the gift she specifically asked for, in two different sizes to ensure the right fit\n\nshe didnt want it \n\nchore lol", "He got her EXACTLY what she asked for.

I didn't really expect the convo to turn into how shit the Mother's Day I planned was, but hey, if that's the case, then better that I know. \n\nI suspect she'd like you. But how good can her taste be, seeing as how she's w me, amirite?", "How is everyone missing the part where the wife specifically requested the items he bought her? For christ sake, SHE doesn't even know what she wears, apparently. How are we faulting the husband for buying her the exact thing she asked for?", "Gift was in a gift back w tissue paper. W card and flowers. First time I can recall she told me specifically what she wanted. She wanted a work coat for xmas and I spent days looking for one but she didnt like what I chose (and it was the wrong fit also)  which possibly is why she picked here to tell me what she wanted. I am prob known more for spending too much $ on gifts more than figuring out particularly thoughtful stuff. Though I make the effort, just not so successful at it.", "Not true. You can return Amazon purchases at Kohl's stores", "No, I expect she will want a replacement coat of her choosing, but she hasn't looked yet I don't think.", "So, if I may, you were expecting to return one? Sorry for being pedantic.", "You asked your kids what they wanted to do and made that the plan for Mother\u2019s Day? Is that what your partner wanted to do with her day? I would also be a little peeved if I had to pay for everyone\u2019s meal on Mother\u2019s Day just because my SO forgot his wallet (which is like one of the most basic things you make sure you have before leaving the house).", ">chore lol\n\nI just know I hate the stress of having extra things to do during the week, so it feels like the least he can do for Mother's day is not give her something extra to do. His gift can be returning it to her. But to be fair, returning a package isn't that strenuous either so they both kind of suck to me for making a big deal. \n\n(And just to be clear before I'm accused of being a hypocrite, yes, I hate having extra things to do, but I also can acknowledge when it's not something that takes a lot of effort to do.)", ">He got her EXACTLY what she asked for.\n\nI assume not since she didn't like them. But I understand that point, too.", "So like, I can see both sides here but I'm slightly coming down in favour of your wife. \n\nYes you got her exactly what she asked for, but like from amazon from a pseudoshared account - it sounds like all you did was click add to cart and confirm. So it's not like she asked you to put in tonnes of effort to find and get the exact item she wanted, your outgoing thought and effort here were effectively 0 thanks to your wife's wishes. \n\nYou also said that once these are returned she's likely just going to buy herself a different coat so really you haven't gotten her anything, you've just briefly been a middle man in her online shop. Again i acknowledge that this is what she asked for, but i think you need to acknowledge the incredibly low effort she had asked for up to this point. \n\nThen on the day you forgot your wallet and one of the activities (no one's fault) was a bust. It sounds like her mothers day was her buying breakfast and a family beach day. Which again, so little actual effort required from you.\n\nI'd return the coats for her simply because i can't see anywhere else on mothers day she asked for or received any actual thought or effort from you. She's set your bar really low, I'd be borderline embarrassed if this is what my spouse sort of expected from me on a special occasion. If i were you I'd work on raising that bar myself but at least do the one actual effortful thing she's asked for.", "what is a kohl's store?", "No, he was expecting her to return at least one", "Toddler kids, at that.", "To be clear, she picked out the coat and told me which sizes to buy.", "Are you in the USA?", "Okay, I have confused myself. \n\nPerson A asked if he expected her to return one. \nOP said no, but then expanded to say that he meant what I understood as 'yes', in that he has indeed expected her to return one. Reasonably so, she cannot wear two coats at once. \nI asked for clarification. \nPerson B (you, sorry for replying to you on the comment thread) has repeated what he said, but without further clarification as to why it's no, he did in fact expect her to return one. \n\nI am so sorry to be weird and pedantic about this, I'm just confused.", "OP did not expect to be the person making the return. OP expected the recipient to return the unneeded item herself. OP didn\u2019t expect to return one, OP expected *the friend* to return one of the two.", "So, I was asked if I expected to return one. I expected one to be returned, but I just assumed that she herself would handle the return of the coat that she elected not to keep.", "Ahhh I see, I get it now.
