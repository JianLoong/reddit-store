She's 30.\n\nNo idea what she went through of course, but I was teased for my religion, had schoolwork and money stolen from me, was chased around the school, had homework ripped out, punished for bad behaviour I didn't do, excluded, everything short of an actual physical attack. My parent's didn't understand the severity, and my teachers didn't care. Every time I had a new friend, they would lie about me and I would lose them. The only way to escape was hiding in the bushes surrounded by the spiders and other insects crawling on my body (that's why I'm afraid of spiders now! Wow!) or scaling a really unsafe pipe and going on the roof (yeah, I can't believe I did that either).\n\nI went through that between the ages of 6-12. Six years of hiding in bushes and getting bad grades due to them ripping my work and not being \"allowed\" to redo it. Six years of being ignored and belittled and thought to be a liar.

Your partner has 30 friends and each had a bully.  That is 30 more names you cannot use.  So 60 names you have to rule out because someone you know was bullied.    There has to be a line drawn somewhere about how much a friend can demand.  If the friend was SA or seriously assaulted then you could reconsider but sorry - it gets to the stage where you cannot let other people's history run your life.", "Nta you are not naming your child after a bully. Do you even know who this bully is. \nYou picked a name you like.", "NTA. Sarah seems not to understand she is not the main character. She also needs some therapy if hearing a name in an utterly different context to her childhood makes her react like this. I mean, what if she interviewed for a job and that was the interviewer\u2019s name? What if someone sent her a bouquet of lilies? What if she falls in love with a gardener? Good lord.\n\nETA: maybe this is her best chance to move past her old trauma, but that decision is on her.", "Your baby has nothing to do with your friend or her past. An opinion given once is fine but repeating it is rude.
