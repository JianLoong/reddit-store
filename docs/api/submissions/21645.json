Not Sarah's. \n\nYou could give Sarah one more chance, with a message: \"I'm so sorry about the bullying in your past honey, but we chose the name Lily because my granny spent hours reading Lily the Llama to me when I was tiny.\" Then see if she responds appropriately, or not. \n\nIf Sarah *actually thinks* you're \"naming your child after one of her bullies\", and persists with the hostility (or envy?), then she is so out of touch with reality that it's best you let the friendship lapse, and certainly keep your daughter away from her. \n\nNTA OP. Remember, she who carries, births, feeds, changes nappies and abandons sleep for the tiny human...gets to name her. Good luck and stay level!", "NTA - your daughter, your pregnancy, your life.

It\u2019s your daughter and you have your own sentimental reasons for naming her that name.  You can\u2019t go around worries about names of bullies of friends and crossing them off.  She\u2019s 30.

It's not her child and even though I don't think it should matter, the name has a very different connotation for you.", "NTA - It is your kid and your right to name her whatever you want.

Tell her you aren't asking her to like it. It's is however, your child's name. \n\nFriend can choose to grow up or stay stuck in the past.\n\nI bet dge tried to give your child a nickname though.
