You are naming your child after a beloved character in a book.  Shame on your friend fir putting a stigma on your child before she is even born.  In essence, she is being a bully herself.", "NTA, for all the reasons already stated, but also (and I say this as someone who was bullied for years), Sarah needs to get over it. She's 30.\n\nNo idea what she went through of course, but I was teased for my religion, had schoolwork and money stolen from me, was chased around the school, had homework ripped out, punished for bad behaviour I didn't do, excluded, everything short of an actual physical attack. My parent's didn't understand the severity, and my teachers didn't care. Every time I had a new friend, they would lie about me and I would lose them. The only way to escape was hiding in the bushes surrounded by the spiders and other insects crawling on my body (that's why I'm afraid of spiders now! Wow!) or scaling a really unsafe pipe and going on the roof (yeah, I can't believe I did that either).\n\nI went through that between the ages of 6-12. Six years of hiding in bushes and getting bad grades due to them ripping my work and not being \"allowed\" to redo it. Six years of being ignored and belittled and thought to be a liar. And I still built myself a bridge and got over it. \n\nSarah needs to do the same.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSay you have 30 friends and each one of them had a bully.  That is 30 names you cannot use.  Your partner has 30 friends and each had a bully.  That is 30 more names you cannot use.  So 60 names you have to rule out because someone you know was bullied.    There has to be a line drawn somewhere about how much a friend can demand.  If the friend was SA or seriously assaulted then you could reconsider but sorry - it gets to the stage where you cannot let other people's history run your life.", "Nta you are not naming your child after a bully. Do you even know who this bully is. \nYou picked a name you like.", "NTA. Sarah seems not to understand she is not the main character. She also needs some therapy if hearing a name in an utterly different context to her childhood makes her react like this. I mean, what if she interviewed for a job and that was the interviewer\u2019s name? What if someone sent her a bouquet of lilies? What if she falls in love with a gardener?

You're welcome.\"", "NAH Of course you can call your daughter whatever you want. Try to understand why that might be hard for Sarah though. \n\nBullying isn't given the weight it deserves. We call it 'being picked on'. What it actually is is sustained abuse of a vulnerable person with no power. At a point in their life when their core identity is being formed. It can be devastating and leave you with lifelong trauma.\n\nImagine instead she'd been assaulted or abused as an adult by a guy called Liam. You always loved the name Liam so want to call your child that. You'd understand then that Sarah had a reason to be uncomfortable with it though.\n\nIt doesn't mean you're wrong for loving the name and it doesn't mean Sarah has the right to tell you you can't use a name. Try to understand that it might mean that Sarah feels triggered regularly because of your choice though. It might mean she just can't be around you.\n\nShe's not told you you can't use the name. She's expressed how she feels about the fact that what she told you didn't affect your decision.", "NTA. Sarah needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around her. Name your baby what you want. If your \"friend\" doesn't like it, she can go kick rocks", "Also, OP is NOT naming her daughter after her friend's bully, she's naming her after a character from  memories with her grandmother.", "It's ok if your friend doesn't like the name. tell her you aren't asking her to like it.", "I could probably use this exact line 20 times a day. People really think the world revolves around them."]}
