It'll take the tiny human about a year and half to be useful at playing.", "She\u2019d tell you that it felt like it! But no, I was factoring in enough time for the aforementioned tiny human to learn to walk. It\u2019s important to manage expectations", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 ok ok, fair enough.", "NTA. She is 30. I'm sorry, but she needs to have come to terms with this a long time ago. The hurt stays, I know, but you cannot hold onto this level of hostility that even the name is verboten.", "NTA. Sarah needs therapy if 1) she can't handle anyone having the same name as someone who bullied her decades ago and 2) she immediately assumes that you could only have chosen your child's name as a personal affront to her.\n\nETA: My bully's name (for the sake of this post anyway) was Sally. As an adult, one of my coworkers who also happens to be named Sally became one of my closest friends. If I'd held her name against her, I would have really missed out!", "NTA - At the end of the day, this is YOUR child. Not your friends. If the name means something to you, you name your kid that and your friend will have to deal with it.", "NTA.  She's wildly overreacting.", "This is actually a great opportunity for your friend to detach her trauma from a name. \n\nBuilding a great relationship with your daughter will now bring happy thoughts and memories when the name comes to mind.\n\nThis is something I have personally experienced. I couldn't stand the name Alex due to things I witnessed as a child.\n\nSince then I have met so many awesome Alex's, since its such a common name, and no long feel awful thinking of the name because I think of those people instead.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nSo your friend was traumatized by a person with the same name with your daughter and she thinks she cannot handle being around any Lilly. Okay, her choice her life. But she has no right to ask you to change her name or accuse you with anything. So she\u2019s the asshole for that. Sarah can withdraw from your friendship if she really thinks she cannot handle it and you have no right to say anything about it.", "Love the last paragraph, especially the bit about abandoning sleep. As I type, I am abandoning sleep for my autistic 22 year old. But he is adorable, and worth it.", "Unless it's an unusual name, someone will associate the name with someone they know/knew. The more people you share the name with, the more likely you are to hear stories of bad people with that name.\n\nOP, you as the parent will be saying the name more than anyone else. Choose a name you like. This child will be someone you scold, praise, encourage, comfort, and so much more for.\n\nI suggest you let Sarah know why you like the name and then leave Sarah alone. She can decide for herself whether to be hateful towards you because of your child's name or to be accepting of your decision with love.", "Bad bot.
