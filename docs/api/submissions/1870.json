I took a first aid course and a babysitting course. \n\nLat weekend one of my little sister's classmates parents had a wedding to go to and asked if I would babysit.  I asked how late they would need me and if I should pack an overnight bag if they were going to be staying out all night.  They said that they would be home by midnight. So I checked with my dad if that was okay because he is my ride. He doesn't want me alone in a car with adults that he does not know. \n\nSo my dad was there to pick me up at 11:50. The kids were all asleep and I was watching tv.  I had texted them at 11:00 to double that they would be in time.  The mom texted me back \"yes\". \n\n12:30 they still aren't there.  I texted again. No answer.  I called my dad and he is pissed.  Not at me. One o'clock. I call them.  No answer.  My dad went and got a coffee at home and came back.  He is all calm.  Not good. He is ready to blow.  \n\nI texted every 15 minutes. No response. \n\n2:20 I have an idea.  I texted them that someone tried to break into their garage but that the alarm scared them away.  \n\nThey were home drunk in an Uber in 15 minutes.  My dad made their pay me for my extra time before we left.  He told me that I'm not allowed to babysit for them again unless I charged them for an overnight stay. \n\nYesterday at school I saw the mom when I was picking up my sister's after school.  \n\nShe gave me shit for scaring her and her husband.  That they had checked their security cameras and no one tried to break in.  I said sorry the alarm went off so I called you.  \n\nShe called me a liar.  Which is fair. But I don't feel bad about what I did. They lied to me first. \n\nMy mom says I should have just sucked it up but my dad says that they broke our deal.  \n\nI kind of feel bad for tricking them into coming home from their party.  But they could have told me it was an overnight or texted me that they were going to be late.  My dad has brought me an overnight bag before when that has happened.\n\n#EDIT\n\nMy mom wanted me to call the police to see if they had been in an accident.

They had no regards to you and your time, forcing a minor to stay up way late and ignoring your texts.

You told a white lie to force thrm homr after all other attempts failed.", "Your dad is right. \n\nSure the lying is not great, but they were the ones who fucked up. \n\nYou are absolutely not an asshole, they are. \n\nAnd learn from your father, not your mother. She's too much into people pleasing", "There\u2019s no judgement needed because you\u2019re NTA at all. They lied to you. Twice. You kept trying to ring and call them and clearly they were checking their messages if they all of sudden came home because they thought the alarm was off. Considering they didn\u2019t text you to say they needed you overnight, despite you asking, they\u2019re the AH for staying out later. \n\nYou\u2019re only 15, and they took advantage of your babysitting. At least your dad was angry at the right people, and he got you the overtime pay. Your mum is an AH for telling you to suck it up. If I thought my teenager was going to be home at a certain time because she was told by the parents they\u2019d be home, I\u2019d expect my child home unless the parents asked nicely if they could change the plans. \n\nI\u2019d just ignore that woman. She\u2019s an AH for doing that to you. It doesn\u2019t matter what she thinks. Only hope that she doesn\u2019t spoil any future business for you.", "NTA you're 15 and not coming home at the agreed to time. Your father took it easy on them.", "NTA, especially since you aren't in charge of your own transportation.   For future reference you should put in a late fee.  Whatever your rate is x5 for every half hour they're late.", "honestly NTA. They decided to get drunk ignore the texts and stay past the time they were supposed to be home,a real shitty thing to do to a 15 yr old babysitter. These sound like real irresponsible parents.", "NTA,  totally get that at your age you lied instead of getting up in an adult's face and calling that mother out on her own shitty behavior ... but she and her husband are the AHs here.\n\nHonesty,  turn down future babysitting gigs from them, if they ever ask you. You are a child too, and staying out till 2:30 am when they were supposed to be home HOURS earlier was abusive towards you. I commend your father for not getting into an altercation with their stupid drunken asses on camera that night... I would have been furious. Not at you, sweetie, at THEM. Their behavior was immature, gross, and disrespectful of both you and your dad and your fsmily...  what if your family had plans on Sunday and you had been up till 3 or 4 am? \n\nYeah, fuck those people. The fact the mom doubled down? And confronted you at school? TELL YOUR PARENTS, and let them go Mama Bear on her entitled drunk ass.", "NTA\n\nYou, a 15 year old, are more responsible than two whole grown ass adults who decided getting drunk was more important than taking care of their kids. \n\nThe fact that they were able to get home in just 15 mins lmao no you're good OP", "NTA. They\u2019re total AHs for trying to get over on you and I wish that you or your dad would have called them out on their BS. They\u2019re even bigger AHs for confronting you afterwards instead of apologizing for making you wait 2.5hours AND it seems like they weren\u2019t going to pay for the extra time if your dad had to make them do it?! Take this as a teaching moment and decide what your rate will be if parents don\u2019t arrive by the indicated time (i.e. double rate during the day, triple rate at night, etc). Also, instead of lying next time, perhaps send a concerning text outlining what time they were supposed to arrive, what time it is, and indicate that you\u2019ll be calling the police within 15min if you don\u2019t receive a response. But you have to actually be committed to calling the police.", "NTA. You already offered to stay the night, they said no.

Those adults sound immature.", "NTA, they were irresponsible to you but also their children. You did what you could in this messy situation.", "NTA\n\nThey were REALLY irresponsible for just expecting you to stay longer than agreed on without any form of communication and without checking if it was OK. You're a minor yourself, what they did was really bad. Good your dad was there to have your back, and picks you up.\n\nGood on you, you found a way to get them to come home fast. Proves that they just decided to ignore your calls", "NTA. It's not cool to lie normally but let's be real... if you hadn't,  they probably would not have bothered. They were several hours late already - who knows how long you and your dad would have had to stay if you hadn't told them the alarm went off.", "NTA.\nYou are a child and they left you 2.5 hours after they said they\u2019d be home, screwing over you and your dad.", "you stayed 2 hours and 30 mins longer than required and used the only tool available to you to get them come back.\n\nand it only took em 15 mins. they were clearly not busy with something or in a traffic jam, or an accident they just didn't want to show up on time. Next time ask her if she would've prefered you just leaving like 00:30? I expect an obvious no. Then ask her well how tf should i've made you come back otherwise?!?", " NTA - they lied to you and you\u2019re still a kid, you also needed to get to bed.

Sounds like they wanted to get away with paying you less.", "Normally I would be against lying, but if they said they were going to be home by 12,they should have at least texted you.\n\nLeaving you to care for their kids overnight basically was at the very least a dick move and at most, a possible risk to their children. \n\nYou and your dad would have been well within your rights to call the police. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did what you had to, they were messed up and took advantage of your kindness.", "NTA\n\nTheyre lucky you didn't call the police for child abandonment.", "NTA THEY lied And took advantage of you.", "Anyone else think it\u2019s weird that she confronted a 15 yo?

Never babysit for them again unless they pay **in advance** for an overnight. And even then, I think you want a back-up plan that isn't them for the morning.   \n\n\nOr never babysit again. That's also 100% fair.", "NTA, I thought you were going to say you told them a kid was sick, but you read your audience correctly and scared them over their possessions - well done!", "nta. they told you they would be back at a certain time and they weren't. you wanted to go home so you had every right to do what needed to be done to get them back home.", "Justified AH, so NTA.  \n\n\nThey were being irresponsible and you, as a 15 year old, couldn't be expected to know how to handle it perfectly when adults drop the ball.  \n\n\nHowever, next time I would suggest a sternly worded text expressing displeasure that they have stayed out past the agreed upon time and spelling out what the consequences will be if they do not return immediately. (This can range from \"my mom/dad will be taking over and I can tell you right now it's unpleasant being chewed out by them\" to \"I'm calling the police to report child abandonment\" depending on the circumstances.)  \n\n\nYour dad is completely right though - you should never babysit for these AHs again.", "NTA but props to ur dad for standing up for you and making sure they paid you extra, seems like a good dude. Plus the fact they came so quickly shows they definitely saw ur messages they just didn't care cuz they figured they would take advantage of a kid, pretty common in babysitting.", "NTA. They chose to ignore you for hours. Yes, you lied, but it was a harmless lie to make them react. Proof: You didn\u2019t even go with an actual scary lie like saying sth was wrong with their kids, which might have put this into everybody sucks territory.\n\nETA If for some reason you have to talk to them again, tell them they\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t call the police for child abandonment when they didn\u2019t come home at the agreed time and didn\u2019t answer for hours despite the 15yo watching their children trying to reach them.", "NTA. Do not sit for them unless they pay 50% more as a fine!", "NTA they were ignoring you and lied to you. Would they rather you'd called CPS and then gone home?", "NTA.  The parents got drunk and ghosted a 15 year old charged with watching their kids.  A text would have helped, but considering how late they were that would still be pretty suspect. The mom doubled down on being an AH by confronting OP, a child, about thr situation.  Yeah, lying wasn't the best look but it was a last resort option in an extreme situation.  It also proved that the parents most definitely saw her texts and were choosing to ignore them.", "NTA they were trying to take advantage of you. They are lucky you didn\u2019t drop the kids off at the police station and go home. I doubt they would have paid for the extra time if your dad wasn\u2019t there.", "NTA at all in this situation if I had someone watching my kid and knew I was gonna be later it\u2019s an apology with an offer for overnight pay raid the fridge order a pizza etc they broke the deal the least they could have done was ensure a fair payout", "Clever idea, well done OP! NTA. They were irresponsible to stop communicating and disrespectful of you and your father\u2019s time.", "NTA. Been there except I was stranded bc it was completely rural. Never babysat for them again", "NTA. You may have been dishonest, but they were dishonest first, and you did what you had to do. They completely disrespected you and the service you are providing for them. Thank goodness your dad was there otherwise I'm sure they would've tried not to pay you for the extra time too.", "NTA.  They lied by promising to be home by midnight and then went Radio Silent.\n\nGood baby sitters are hard to find.  And expensive.  They are about to find that out when you find another kid to sit for.", "NTA, though what I would've done is telling my dad at 1 that he can go home to sleep, and then text them a final one, that I'll be charging them for a whole night plus uber to take me home and would've slept on the couch.", "NTA. I fired a family for this when I was in high school. They were supposed to be home by 10 and finally showed up at almost 2. It was a school night and I was pissed. I'm glad your dad was there to make sure rhat they paid you extra.", "NTA.", "I mean they brought it on themselves when they refused to answer multiple text messages so they can suck it. \n\nObviously NTA.", "NTA \n\nHOWEVER:\nDon\u2019t get used to lying to people, OP. I don\u2019t think this makes you an AH considering what they pulled off but lying is never a good choice. \n\nFor the future, think what your tolerance would be in situations like this, let\u2019s say it\u2019s 2 hours. Next time somebody doesnt show up in time or doesn\u2019t respond to your calls, after 1h you can send them a message that if they will not respond or show up in an hour that you will leave. \nYou will come back next morning for your payment, or better they are to deliver it to you. Ask them to confirm they read this as soon as they see it. If they do not respond you can still decide what to do.\n\nYou are a child and you aren\u2019t supposed to work nights. At the end of the day their children are their responsibility and if they decide to get wasted then they have to accept all the consequences. \n\nWorst case scenario would be an accident or something, but it is very unlikely and even if, you could continue taking care of the kids the next day in case they still haven\u2019t arrived or you haven\u2019t heard of them.\n\nEdit: Everyone\u2019s right leaving the kid alone is a bad idea but I still think standing up for yourself and saying this is the last time you are doing this and demanding extra pay is absolutely reasonable. These people are shitty parents because if a fire broke out you have another kid having to have to deal with it.", "NTA but what you did wasn\u2019t the best. I think you should\u2019ve called it a night and stayed overnight when it got to about 1. If they didn\u2019t want you to do that then too bad, they should\u2019ve come home on tome", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA on so many levels. You NEVER lie about the safety of a parent\u2019s children. Never. Full stop. You don\u2019t need to be babysitting if you\u2019re going to lie. We\u2019re they wrong? Yes. If you plan on babysitting in the future have them sign a contract stating that for every 10 min they are late it will be an additional $10. You could have had your dad call them. You could have spent the night and had your dad bring clothes then charge them twice the normal overnight rate wirh your dad standing there. There are tons of options.

So many options before lying.", "They did not.", "I babysat for parents who I swear were alcoholics. They told me they'd be home at 12. They told me 2am at 12:30am. This was normal for them so I just settled in on the couch. I must have fallen asleep because suddenly I'm getting shaken awake. I'm so groggy and confused that I don't check the time. They pay me, reeking of booze and swaying around and stumbling,  and I leave. I step outside and realize its sunny out?? I checked my phone and it was 6:30am! They hadn't texted me asking me to stay later either. I was 16 and my mom was furious.

They loved me so it wasn't a bad gig. She was always later than she said so I was charging her the same whether some or all kids were there, she then decided that she didn't need my services anymore. Worked out that way for me in the mid 90s. It's disrespectful, more so when someone else is picking up, to be that late. NTA op", "Absolutely not, it's a clear cut NTA.

Did you tell your parents about her giving you shit at school? Hopefully, they never ask you to babysit again!\n\nETA - 30 min, 40 min late, would be annoying but once it went over over 60 min with no contact... they are mega AH.

It was way past the time they said they\u2019d be back and they were taking the piss. If I was OP\u2019s parents, I\u2019d be so mad at them for doing that. Clearly they were taking advantage of the fact that she probably wouldn\u2019t have left until they got home, so they could have stayed out as long as they wanted.", "Maybe I am too old but I didn\u2019t need to be watched after a certain hour and in all my years babysitting I never had toddlers or kids wake up and yell in the hours between 2-5. What you forget is that OP is a kid as well and she is working Late night, early morning hours! In the end you gotta trust your gut, OP knows these children better than me and if she felt like something\u2019s off with the parents of course she may stay. I said it to someone else, there is no perfect solution but it\u2019s clear as day that OP is not the AH", "I think the parents not coming home calls for a bad outcome. Either she stays gets stressed no sleep angry dad and the feeling to be walked over or she warns them she is gonna leave in 1/2/3 hours whatever she deems okay. There is no good perfect solution here is how I see it. If the parents respond then she waits for their arrival, if they ignore here, how long is a 15yo AND her father supposed to wait? She is a kid as well and to my knowledge she may not work this late. They took advantage of her. We see the alarm system lie worked, setting boundaries and telling them she is going to leave soon would have worked without the lie. If I tell a babysitter I will be back at mitnight I consider my children unattended at 0:15am! It\u2019s their responsibility and not hers.

Bad behaviour by the parents means you are out of luck the next time you need a sitter.  The lack of apology would be unheard of here.

I hope they had a great time at that wedding, in my area it would be the last wedding they were able to attend until their kids could stay home alone.", "Hm. Sounds like child abandonment and a call to CPS/the police.", "You handled this pretty darn well overall. I will say from your description of events that I am glad your dad was handling the situation with you. No disrespect to your mom, but she strikes me more as the \"don't rock the boat\" type, and that's not really a healthy attitude to have. Standing up for yourself, without being ridiculous about it, is the way to be. That means you will invariably encounter people, who are used to trouncing boundaries, getting mad at you and blaming you for their decisions, but that is infinitely better than perpetually avoiding any and all conflict and ending up being the one losing time and time again. Set clear boundaries in life, keep in mind those boundaries will soften and harden over time, but feel no shame in enforcing them, nor in letting the people who don't respect them fall to the wayside.", ">Please tell me they apologized when they finally got home / They did not\n\nThis is my surprised face. /s", "They managed to miraculously come home in 15 minutes in an Uber.

Don't risk babysitting for them again .", "All they needed to do was text that the party was still going strong and ASK if you minded staying the night after all.

Some people may take it super wrong and something bad could happen.

If you don't come back by X time I will charge you for the night.\n\nThat way you already set the boundaries and your dad doesn't have to wait hours for you.\n\nNTA. They were being jerks.

They might have been leaving a bar that closed @ 2 & on their way home at that point.
