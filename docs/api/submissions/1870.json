I took a first aid course and a babysitting course. \n\nLat weekend one of my little sister's classmates parents had a wedding to go to and asked if I would babysit.  I asked how late they would need me and if I should pack an overnight bag if they were going to be staying out all night.  They said that they would be home by midnight. So I checked with my dad if that was okay because he is my ride. He doesn't want me alone in a car with adults that he does not know. \n\nSo my dad was there to pick me up at 11:50. The kids were all asleep and I was watching tv.  I had texted them at 11:00 to double that they would be in time.  The mom texted me back \"yes\". \n\n12:30 they still aren't there.  I texted again. No answer.  I called my dad and he is pissed.  Not at me. One o'clock. I call them.  No answer.  My dad went and got a coffee at home and came back.  He is all calm.  Not good. He is ready to blow.  \n\nI texted every 15 minutes. No response. \n\n2:20 I have an idea.  I texted them that someone tried to break into their garage but that the alarm scared them away.  \n\nThey were home drunk in an Uber in 15 minutes.  My dad made their pay me for my extra time before we left.  He told me that I'm not allowed to babysit for them again unless I charged them for an overnight stay. \n\nYesterday at school I saw the mom when I was picking up my sister's after school.  \n\nShe gave me shit for scaring her and her husband.  That they had checked their security cameras and no one tried to break in.  I said sorry the alarm went off so I called you.  \n\nShe called me a liar.  Which is fair. But I don't feel bad about what I did. They lied to me first. \n\nMy mom says I should have just sucked it up but my dad says that they broke our deal.  \n\nI kind of feel bad for tricking them into coming home from their party.  But they could have told me it was an overnight or texted me that they were going to be late.  My dad has brought me an overnight bag before when that has happened.\n\n#EDIT\n\nMy mom wanted me to call the police to see if they had been in an accident.

They had no regards to you and your time, forcing a minor to stay up way late and ignoring your texts. The fact that they came home right after you scared thrm shows that they read your texts, just decided to ignore them. You told a white lie to force thrm homr after all other attempts failed.", "Your dad is right. \n\nSure the lying is not great, but they were the ones who fucked up. \n\nYou are absolutely not an asshole, they are. \n\nAnd learn from your father, not your mother. She's too much into people pleasing", "There\u2019s no judgement needed because you\u2019re NTA at all. They lied to you. Twice. You kept trying to ring and call them and clearly they were checking their messages if they all of sudden came home because they thought the alarm was off. Considering they didn\u2019t text you to say they needed you overnight, despite you asking, they\u2019re the AH for staying out later. \n\nYou\u2019re only 15, and they took advantage of your babysitting. At least your dad was angry at the right people, and he got you the overtime pay. Your mum is an AH for telling you to suck it up. If I thought my teenager was going to be home at a certain time because she was told by the parents they\u2019d be home, I\u2019d expect my child home unless the parents asked nicely if they could change the plans. \n\nI\u2019d just ignore that woman. She\u2019s an AH for doing that to you. It doesn\u2019t matter what she thinks. Only hope that she doesn\u2019t spoil any future business for you.", "NTA you're 15 and not coming home at the agreed to time. Your father took it easy on them.", "NTA, especially since you aren't in charge of your own transportation.   For future reference you should put in a late fee.  Whatever your rate is x5 for every half hour they're late.", "honestly NTA. They decided to get drunk ignore the texts and stay past the time they were supposed to be home,a real shitty thing to do to a 15 yr old babysitter. These sound like real irresponsible parents.", "NTA,  totally get that at your age you lied instead of getting up in an adult's face and calling that mother out on her own shitty behavior ... but she and her husband are the AHs here.\n\nHonesty,  turn down future babysitting gigs from them, if they ever ask you. You are a child too, and staying out till 2:30 am when they were supposed to be home HOURS earlier was abusive towards you. I commend your father for not getting into an altercation with their stupid drunken asses on camera that night... I would have been furious. Not at you, sweetie, at THEM. Their behavior was immature, gross, and disrespectful of both you and your dad and your fsmily...  what if your family had plans on Sunday and you had been up till 3 or 4 am? \n\nYeah, fuck those people. The fact the mom doubled down? And confronted you at school? TELL YOUR PARENTS, and let them go Mama Bear on her entitled drunk ass.", "NTA\n\nYou, a 15 year old, are more responsible than two whole grown ass adults who decided getting drunk was more important than taking care of their kids. \n\nThe fact that they were able to get home in just 15 mins lmao no you're good OP", "NTA. They\u2019re total AHs for trying to get over on you and I wish that you or your dad would have called them out on their BS. They\u2019re even bigger AHs for confronting you afterwards instead of apologizing for making you wait 2.5hours AND it seems like they weren\u2019t going to pay for the extra time if your dad had to make them do it?! Take this as a teaching moment and decide what your rate will be if parents don\u2019t arrive by the indicated time (i.e. double rate during the day, triple rate at night, etc). Also, instead of lying next time, perhaps send a concerning text outlining what time they were supposed to arrive, what time it is, and indicate that you\u2019ll be calling the police within 15min if you don\u2019t receive a response. But you have to actually be committed to calling the police.", "NTA. You already offered to stay the night, they said no.

Those adults sound immature.", "NTA, they were irresponsible to you but also their children. You did what you could in this messy situation.", "NTA\n\nThey were REALLY irresponsible for just expecting you to stay longer than agreed on without any form of communication and without checking if it was OK. You're a minor yourself, what they did was really bad. Good your dad was there to have your back, and picks you up.\n\nGood on you, you found a way to get them to come home fast. Proves that they just decided to ignore your calls", "NTA. It's not cool to lie normally but let's be real... if you hadn't,  they probably would not have bothered.

Next time ask her if she would've prefered you just leaving like 00:30? I expect an obvious no. Then ask her well how tf should i've made you come back otherwise?!?", " NTA - they lied to you and you\u2019re still a kid, you also needed to get to bed. Not to mention your father was up late waiting.", "NTA\n\nYou tried the adult route and they weren\u2019t responsive. Sounds like they wanted to get away with paying you less.", "Normally I would be against lying, but if they said they were going to be home by 12,they should have at least texted you.\n\nLeaving you to care for their kids overnight basically was at the very least a dick move and at most, a possible risk to their children. \n\nYou and your dad would have been well within your rights to call the police. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did what you had to, they were messed up and took advantage of your kindness.", "NTA\n\nTheyre lucky you didn't call the police for child abandonment.", "NTA THEY lied And took advantage of you.", "Anyone else think it\u2019s weird that she confronted a 15 yo?

Never babysit for them again unless they pay **in advance** for an overnight. And even then, I think you want a back-up plan that isn't them for the morning.   \n\n\nOr never babysit again. That's also 100% fair.", "NTA, I thought you were going to say you told them a kid was sick, but you read your audience correctly and scared them over their possessions - well done!", "nta. they told you they would be back at a certain time and they weren't. you wanted to go home so you had every right to do what needed to be done to get them back home.", "Justified AH, so NTA.  \n\n\nThey were being irresponsible and you, as a 15 year old, couldn't be expected to know how to handle it perfectly when adults drop the ball.  \n\n\nHowever, next time I would suggest a sternly worded text expressing displeasure that they have stayed out past the agreed upon time and spelling out what the consequences will be if they do not return immediately. (This can range from \"my mom/dad will be taking over and I can tell you right now it's unpleasant being chewed out by them\" to \"I'm calling the police to report child abandonment\" depending on the circumstances.)  \n\n\nYour dad is completely right though - you should never babysit for these AHs again.", "NTA but props to ur dad for standing up for you and making sure they paid you extra, seems like a good dude. Plus the fact they came so quickly shows they definitely saw ur messages they just didn't care cuz they figured they would take advantage of a kid, pretty common in babysitting.", "NTA. They chose to ignore you for hours. Yes, you lied, but it was a harmless lie to make them react. Proof: You didn\u2019t even go with an actual scary lie like saying sth was wrong with their kids, which might have put this into everybody sucks territory.\n\nETA If for some reason you have to talk to them again, tell them they\u2019re lucky you didn\u2019t call the police for child abandonment when they didn\u2019t come home at the agreed time and didn\u2019t answer for hours despite the 15yo watching their children trying to reach them.", "NTA. Do not sit for them unless they pay 50% more as a fine!", "NTA they were ignoring you and lied to you. Would they rather you'd called CPS and then gone home?", "NTA.  The parents got drunk and ghosted a 15 year old charged with watching their kids.  A text would have helped, but considering how late they were that would still be pretty suspect. The mom doubled down on being an AH by confronting OP, a child, about thr situation.  Yeah, lying wasn't the best look but it was a last resort option in an extreme situation.  It also proved that the parents most definitely saw her texts and were choosing to ignore them.", "NTA they were trying to take advantage of you. They are lucky you didn\u2019t drop the kids off at the police station and go home. I doubt they would have paid for the extra time if your dad wasn\u2019t there.", "NTA at all in this situation if I had someone watching my kid and knew I was gonna be later it\u2019s an apology with an offer for overnight pay raid the fridge order a pizza etc they broke the deal the least they could have done was ensure a fair payout", "Clever idea, well done OP! NTA. They were irresponsible to stop communicating and disrespectful of you and your father\u2019s time.", "NTA. Been there except I was stranded bc it was completely rural. Never babysat for them again", "NTA. You may have been dishonest, but they were dishonest first, and you did what you had to do. They completely disrespected you and the service you are providing for them. Thank goodness your dad was there otherwise I'm sure they would've tried not to pay you for the extra time too.", "NTA.  They lied by promising to be home by midnight and then went Radio Silent.\n\nGood baby sitters are hard to find.  And expensive.  They are about to find that out when you find another kid to sit for.", "NTA, though what I would've done is telling my dad at 1 that he can go home to sleep, and then text them a final one, that I'll be charging them for a whole night plus uber to take me home and would've slept on the couch.", "NTA. I fired a family for this when I was in high school. They were supposed to be home by 10 and finally showed up at almost 2. It was a school night and I was pissed. I'm glad your dad was there to make sure rhat they paid you extra.", "NTA.", "I mean they brought it on themselves when they refused to answer multiple text messages so they can suck it. \n\nObviously NTA.", "NTA \n\nHOWEVER:\nDon\u2019t get used to lying to people, OP. I don\u2019t think this makes you an AH considering what they pulled off but lying is never a good choice. \n\nEDIT: \nAnyway, I think standing up for yourself and saying this is the last time you are doing this and demanding extra pay is absolutely reasonable. These people are shitty parents because if a fire broke out you have another kid having to have to deal with it. Also, working overtime pulling a night shift you weren\u2019t prepared for can make you so tired you might be the one who causes a fire breakout. Initially I deem OP\u2018s life and well being as just as important and gave a stupid suggestion that was more meant as a bluff to make the parents come home faster, with OP being a child that need to be protected as well in mind but it was dumb so I removed it. I thought that to me this is child abuse, using a 15yo kid doing work at an unreasonable time while most likely tired (which goes against safety at work) basically pushing her into an adult role.", "NTA but what you did wasn\u2019t the best. I think you should\u2019ve called it a night and stayed overnight when it got to about 1. If they didn\u2019t want you to do that then too bad, they should\u2019ve come home on tome", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

YTA on so many levels. You NEVER lie about the safety of a parent\u2019s children. Never. Full stop. You don\u2019t need to be babysitting if you\u2019re going to lie. We\u2019re they wrong? Yes. If you plan on babysitting in the future have them sign a contract stating that for every 10 min they are late it will be an additional $10. You could have had your dad call them. You could have spent the night and had your dad bring clothes then charge them twice the normal overnight rate wirh your dad standing there. There are tons of options. You could have discussed calling the police with your dad bc the last communication you got was that they would be home at midnight. What if they had gotten in a wreck?!?! So many options before lying.", "They did not.", "I babysat for parents who I swear were alcoholics. They told me they'd be home at 12. They told me 2am at 12:30am. This was normal for them so I just settled in on the couch. I must have fallen asleep because suddenly I'm getting shaken awake. I'm so groggy and confused that I don't check the time. They pay me, reeking of booze and swaying around and stumbling,  and I leave. I step outside and realize its sunny out?? I checked my phone and it was 6:30am!

They loved me so it wasn't a bad gig. She was always later than she said so I was charging her the same whether some or all kids were there, she then decided that she didn't need my services anymore. Worked out that way for me in the mid 90s. It's disrespectful, more so when someone else is picking up, to be that late. NTA op", "Absolutely not, it's a clear cut NTA.

Did you tell your parents about her giving you shit at school? Hopefully, they never ask you to babysit again!\n\nETA - 30 min, 40 min late, would be annoying but once it went over over 60 min with no contact... they are mega AH.

It was way past the time they said they\u2019d be back and they were taking the piss. If I was OP\u2019s parents, I\u2019d be so mad at them for doing that. Clearly they were taking advantage of the fact that she probably wouldn\u2019t have left until they got home, so they could have stayed out as long as they wanted.", "Maybe I am too old but I didn\u2019t need to be watched after a certain hour and in all my years babysitting I never had toddlers or kids wake up and yell in the hours between 2-5. What you forget is that OP is a kid as well and she is working Late night, early morning hours! In the end you gotta trust your gut, OP knows these children better than me and if she felt like something\u2019s off with the parents of course she may stay. I said it to someone else, there is no perfect solution but it\u2019s clear as day that OP is not the AH", "I think the parents not coming home calls for a bad outcome. Either she stays gets stressed no sleep angry dad and the feeling to be walked over or she warns them she is gonna leave in 1/2/3 hours whatever she deems okay. There is no good perfect solution here is how I see it. If the parents respond then she waits for their arrival, if they ignore here, how long is a 15yo AND her father supposed to wait? She is a kid as well and to my knowledge she may not work this late. They took advantage of her. We see the alarm system lie worked, setting boundaries and telling them she is going to leave soon would have worked without the lie. If I tell a babysitter I will be back at mitnight I consider my children unattended at 0:15am! It\u2019s their responsibility and not hers. This lie I consider OK but I wouldn\u2019t get used to it, is all I\u2019m saying.", "And much more importantly, **young children will be left home alone at night**.

I very much understand her wanting to give the couple the benefit of the doubt that they wouldn\u2019t just stay out drinking and something must have happened to them.  I can\u2019t say that I for sure wouldn\u2019t feel the same in her position, as I tend to want to see the best in people.  But from the outside looking in, I can very much say that while I admire her motivations, she wanted you to roll over and let them walk all over you. \n\nThey broke the agreement and acted like immature children ignoring their curfew.  Like, a 15-year-old, an actual child, was acting like more of an adult.  By all accounts, I don\u2019t think it would be out of your rights to at that point report the kids as abandoned and leave them in the care of the law and go home.  (I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what you SHOULD have done in this situation, just that legally I\u2019m pretty sure they could technically be considered abandoning their children by dumping them on you for HOURS after the agreed upon time, and you\u2019re a minor who wasn\u2019t supposed to be away from home all night.)", "NTA, but next time try to be upfront instead of lying. Its hard, but they're less likely to repeat the behavior that way.", "NTA\n\nthey were not responding to you, were late, and left you in charge of their children. You could have called the cops and had the cops step in until they were able to connect with the parents. is lying the right thing to do? In any other situation I'd say no. What you did was quick thinking that got them home in 15 when they should have been home HOURS earlier.", "NTA It\u2019s hard enough as adults to deal with situations like this, so you acted in a way you felt would get results. I\u2019m really sorry you were put in that position. Everyone who has ever babysat as a teenager has had this experience and it sucks. The parents were out of line, acted irresponsibly, and then came at you for it.

Your dad is right", "NTA. But honestly, don\u2019t babysit for them again. They obviously have no respect for your time. You would have been well within your rights to call the police to see if they were in an accident, as your mom suggested, or even to say that if they weren\u2019t home soon you\u2019d call the police for child abandonment. \n\nThey had the chance to tell you this would be an overnight thing. You even offered. They said it wasn\u2019t and then tried to make it. Even at 11pm, they were still insisting they\u2019d be back by midnight? Why? At that point, your dad could have still brought you anything you needed. \n\nYeah, you need to fire them from your babysitting roster. They aren\u2019t worth it. Also, you are well within your rights to also let what happened be known among the other parents and babysitters, so that the parents here can\u2019t lie about you to others and so the other babysitters know that they pull this kind of thing.", "NTA\n\nBut make sure you tell everyone at school what happened and that they should not work for these people", "Shit like this is why I stopped babysitting for my older sister.

I\u2019d would absolutely not work for them again and call them out to the company I work for and other nannies if it came up. That\u2019s totally unacceptable. What\u2019s even worse is that you\u2019re essentially a child, they\u2019re no doubt making use of that and the cheaper labour and then screwing over you and your dad as well. Please feel absolutely no guilt for what you did, they deserved it.", "NTA. They lied to you twice. First they said they would be home at midnight.  You even said you'd be willing to stay overnight with advance notice. Then at 11 they said they'd be back at midnight.  They suck.", "NTA, personally I would have given a warning in text form that if they didn't respond then you would be calling the authorities. Lying is... I can see why it's wrong in most cases, but the bottom line is that they were absolutely reading your texts and choosing to ignore you to go back on their agreement, and your lie got them to finally come home. You're already not babysitting for them again so just see this as a win/win that they won't request you back. But if you have any other friends or classmates who babysit, I'd let them know what happened to you so that they know to not agree to babysit for those parents either.", "NTA.  Not by a long shot.  They were supposed to be home at 12, they only came home because they thought that there'd been a break in.  They are so much TA.\n\nAnd tell your teacher about the parent having a go at you, there's a good chance that your school will ensure that she's kept away from you.", "NTA: They gave you a specific time of when they would be back. You agreed to that specific time, no more. Just because you are 15 doesn\u2019t mean they get to take advantage of you. Which is exactly what they did. They didn\u2019t call or text to let you know that they would be out later then they thought. They didn\u2019t respect you or your father\u2019s time. Please, please, please tell your parents and the school about the mother approaching you and yelling at you when you were on school grounds. She had absolutely no right to harass you in that way. Do not just \u201csuck it up\u201d. I get that you are only 15, and it\u2019s whatever cause you\u2019re babysitting\u2026 but you should be learning now what is appropriate and inappropriate for a boss/manager/supervisor to say and do to their employees. If they took their children to a daycare and didn\u2019t pick up on time or answer, the daycare would not provide services to them anymore. They could also decide to call social services to pick up the child if the parents weren\u2019t answering and refused to show up on time. They are lucky that the only action you took to was to lie in order to get them back home. They are only acting like this because you are a teenager. You have the world at your fingertips with the internet. Go online and look up local laws on child care. Ask other adults (teachers, coaches, friends parents) what they would have personally done and what they think about what happened. A lot of jobs are like this. So take this opportunity to ask questions and learn some tricks on laws and how to protect yourself in the future.", "NTA, you\u2019re 15 so they should respect a parent is picking you up/ your parents may have concerns based on the hour you stay until. Your solution to lie was a little immature. TBH you should have told them about the actual problem, your deal was 12, your dad was waiting and concerned, that\u2019s the issue and it\u2019s fine to tell ppl when they\u2019ve crossed your boundaries or broken your deal.. They are huge assholes though for showing up two hours late w no communication on a 15 y/o at that, it\u2019s very inappropriate on them. Maybe next time tell anyone else you sit for you need a \u201cI\u2019m twenty minutes away On my way back\u201d kinda text and call your dad for a ride at that point, ppl do want a babysitter to be a little flexible but with communication. I think your parents should get in touch w these other parents to tell them where you were coming from, how it impacted you and your dad, and basically school them on showing respect for keeping a 15 y/o out until 2 AM w no word. Hopefully some mom/dad shaming with stop them from messing up your prospects w other families.", "Gotta admit, if I were your parent I would have gone home, gotten the wife, then taken you back home. Then the wife and I would be sitting on their couch when they got home, and they would have gotten an.eardul from both of us before I basically jacked them for as much as I could for my kid. Then I would let everyone in the neighborhood know what they did so some other unaware child is taken advantage of. Nobody would treat my kid that way.

It\u2019s not like they were 15 minutes late, they were 2 and a half hours late. If you didn\u2019t lie, god knows what time they would have gotten back. The worst part is that you\u2019re underage so they know you don\u2019t drive and they were drunk so they weren\u2019t going to give you a lift. They really expected a 15 year old to get a taxi late at night or for your parents to stay up till a ridiculous time.\n\nIf they knew that there was a chance they\u2019d be home late then they should\u2019ve given you a heads up.

The first time they were late by several hours, but they were in contact with me. \u201cFifteen minutes\u201d after every half hour mark, and then they started making additional requests: can you tidy the play room? Do the dishes before we get home? Being young and naive I did what they asked. Two weeks later they asked me to babysit again. Except this time, they decided to tell their neighbors that they got a babysitter for the night and their neighbors dropped their own kids at my \u201cemployers\u201d home. I almost got saddled with another six kids. Thank god my parents didn\u2019t leave the driveway yet. I noped out of that job, and had my parents take me home. I warned all of my friends about that family and I made sure that I would only be taking care of children who were directly part of the family from then on out.\n\nPlease learn from my mistake. These people probably thought they could take advantage of you, and thought they could get away with not paying.

I definitely told the person that recommended them I was busy if they asked if I could sit for other friends. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad cutting off clients who don\u2019t value your time or are not honest!", "NTA you're clever you'll make it in this world", "If they want to cause a problem for you at school I\u2019m sure your dad would love to give him a piece of his mind. He\u2019s also( I\u2019m assuming ) has places to be and would rather not have his time wasted as well let alone have his teenage daughter be taken advantage ofZ you should\u2019ve left at 12:30 and called the authorities to drs with the neglected children. Lesson learned for the next people you baby sit for.", "Honestly? At 1 am you and your dad should have called the police. NTA", "NTA - Don't babysit for them again.  They will take advantage of your time without a single thought of you.", "> She called me a liar.\n\nYeah well so is her and her her husband. Midnight they said, yes she said.\n\nAll of you may be liars but only they are TAs.\n\nNTA", "Nta- next time call the police so they can take care of the situation and you can go home", "Agreed! Also, how insulting is it that they could rush home at the thought of stuff in their garage being stolen but not to relieve their underage babysitter? They are total a-holes!", "And they showed up drunk with children to care for.  They don't sound very responsible as parents at all.  I agree with OP they lied first and left a 15 year old for hours into the early morning.  OP make sure everyone knows they don't keep their word and are inconsiderate about your time.", "They lied to you about when they would be home.  They don\u2019t have any right to be mad at you.\n\n NTA", "NTA, obv. I mean as a general rule of thumb, lying about break ins isn\u2019t a great idea but I can totally understand where OP was coming from. And mature parents wouldn\u2019t have allowed it to ever get to the point that a fabricated story was necessary to bring them home. \n\nIt was disrespectful of your time plus your dad\u2019s time. Not to mention you\u2019re a minor alone in a stranger\u2019s house with no sign of the parents coming back.\n\nAs for why the mom got mad, sometimes people have defensive reactions to shame and embarrassment. She probably felt embarrassed that they came back so late drunk and your dad was there. Some can only respond to feeling blame or being in the wrong by blowing up at people to escape feeling accountable. The parents are TA here for leaving their kids and another child home alone for hours. \n\nIt\u2019s also funny to me that the parents were upset that you lied to them, but didn\u2019t seem too bothered by leaving the kids in the house by themselves with a 15 yr old for hours into the night without an adult present. \n\nEither way, you\u2019re NTA.", "I have heard so many situations about kids on this sub that all end with people saying the same thing.\n\nYou can never be unreachable for the person watching your kids!", "Just me telling my dad that an adult approached me to tell me off because she wasn't adult enough to take on a grownup would make this a real comedy. Oh but Big Poppa would go the hell off and I would no longer be allowed to so much as speak to this woman again. And what's funnier to me is he would tell her *she* was no longer \"allowed\" to approach one if his children for any reason.\n\nomg but my dad would be clowning her just so she understands that bullying a teenager isn't worth the price of admission. \ud83e\udd23", "YUP. They just decided to stay and continued to enjoy the party.  No regard for others, figured OP was just 15 and wouldn't be able to do much about it.  Convinced themselves it wasn't a big deal.

Dad is great at teaching his daughter to set boundaries and stand up for herself. Mom, not so much. \n\nIf you keep \u201esucking it up\u201c, there are people who will just give you more and more to swallow.

You\u2019re a grown adult and you not only blatantly LIED to the person watching your children, but you inconvenienced my dad and worried my mom and myself thinking you may have been in an accident. All just to get drunk and party. You should be grateful that I didn\u2019t call the authorities and report you for abandonment and neglect as I would have been within my rights to do so.

I wound up going to a breeder referred to me by one of the foster volunteers. I still look at the rescue listings and there are single digits of dogs for multiple states. I have another friend who was rejected for good from the same group because he didn\u2019t try an experimental medical treat for his aging sick dog that would not have cured her.\n\nI DO believe in pet adoption, but MUCH easier said than done.", "NTA, they messed up, and are extremely upset they got called out for being pieces of excrement.  You aren't going to work for them again, and you should put it out there what they did, and that they'll probably do it again.
