That\u2019s just\u2026a bit to unpack.  But absolutely NTA. \n\nSo, the most alarming takeaway is that he told you to respect him and do as you\u2019re told.  Excuse me?  You did nothing wrong here. You are not some doll he can wind up and bring out only when it suits him.  And he has you doubting yourself and apologizing\u2026when you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  Top that off with the sulking, so you\u2019ll feel guilty for putting him in a bad mood. \n\nEven if he\u2019s a great guy most of the time, this is a 5 alarm \ud83d\udea9drill.

If my dog was supposed to wait in the car and then suddenly joined me when I was talking to somebody I'd be a little upset. \n\nIf a human did it, I would assume they made their choices because they have free will. \n\n\nIf you don't recognize that this guy is not valuing you as a human being, then I would recommend talking to a doctor.

Gross. \n\nHe asked you to stay in the car because of parking. You agreed but then realized that you may get fined anyway, so paid and parked.

Did he ask you to stay in the car because he knew you would make him uncomfortable in front of his relative with your PDA?", "NTA OP; him claiming that \u201cYou don\u2019t listen to me\u201d is just stupid in my opinion because there are times where not listening can be a good thing. For instance; not going with somebody who wants you to go with them to an event where bad things are known to happen is a good choice because you\u2019re saving yourself. I\u2019m not saying that you should disobey people; but sometimes you gotta realise that people can be stupid without knowing it & this situation here is one of them.", "NTA.

Not just ditzy but obstinate as well. No thanks lol\n\nI doubt he'll break up with you for that but it will change his attitude towards the whole idea of dating you. This is how I'd react to.

You\u2019re NTA.", "I can\u2019t say either, because I obviously was not there to see him react.\n\n\nBut I\u2019m from a culture that doesn\u2019t do PDA. Couples who kiss in front of their own children are rare. And to kiss in front of relatives would be so improper, except at a western-style wedding ceremony. Even now, people kissing in public is rarely seen. So if that\u2019s the case, I think they should communicate more on what each other\u2019s boundaries are.\n\n\nIf he is just a controlling guy, she is definitely NTA."]}
