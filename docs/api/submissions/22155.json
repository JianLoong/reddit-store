I hope you take a good hard look at his expectations and ask yourself if you want to be in a relationship with a partner who thinks he is your parent. \n\n>I tried to explain that I didn\u2019t realise that I was doing anything wrong and apologised for upsetting him but he continued to sulk about it and is still in a bad mood with me.\n\nYou did nothing wrong and had no reason to apologize.

Run,", "NTA - you paid for the parking, and how was you supposed to know he wanted along time with his relative? Also what kind of alone time is 5 mins anyways? Not a fan of him saying \u201cthis isn\u2019t the first time you didn\u2019t listen to me\u201d either it sounds controlling", "You didn\u2019t listen to him?? What is he, your father? NTA Ew, girl run.", "NTA with some red flags waving. \"It's not the first time I haven't done what he's told me.\" Partners don't talk like that. Abusers do.", "Oh, wow!  That\u2019s just\u2026a bit to unpack.  But absolutely NTA. \n\nSo, the most alarming takeaway is that he told you to respect him and do as you\u2019re told.  Excuse me?  You did nothing wrong here. You are not some doll he can wind up and bring out only when it suits him.  And he has you doubting yourself and apologizing\u2026when you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.  Top that off with the sulking, so you\u2019ll feel guilty for putting him in a bad mood. \n\nEven if he\u2019s a great guy most of the time, this is a 5 alarm \ud83d\udea9drill. This is how abusers start.  First comes the control and the guilt.  Then the negative comments about what they claim is wrong with you.  And after you\u2019ve been beaten down emotionally, it\u2019s likely to turn physical.  Run away.", "NTA. He really sounds like he wants a robot girlfriend, not a thinking, feeling human being with her own mind and preferences. You had a good reason not to follow his instructions. If he\u2019d requested that you stay home and you agreed but then the house caught fire, would he expect you to burn with it? Run, girl, and don\u2019t date this type again.", ">it\u2019s not the first time I haven\u2019t done what he\u2019s told me\n\nWhen did they start allowing dogs on Reddit? Because unless you're a dog (with four legs and a tail) I don't understand why he thinks that you are supposed to obey him. \n\nThe only way this makes sense is that you're his dog. If my dog was supposed to wait in the car and then suddenly joined me when I was talking to somebody I'd be a little upset. \n\nIf a human did it, I would assume they made their choices because they have free will. \n\n\nIf you don't recognize that this guy is not valuing you as a human being, then I would recommend talking to a doctor. Because No one should feel that way. And rather it's chemical or emotional, a professional can help. \n\nNTA", "Nta. This is a little weird.", "NTA.  what you did is literally no big deal at all, you didn't need to apologize and he definitely doesn't need to act that way.  if he wanted to see his relative alone, he should have made it clear that that's why he asked you to stay in the car.  if you have to pay for parking, i don't think it matters if someone is in the car or not.  \n\nthis is extremely concerning:\n\n>He has said that I should respect him and do what he asks of me, and that it\u2019s not the first time I haven\u2019t done what he\u2019s told me\n\nyou aren't his slave, robot, lady in waiting, or whatever else you want to call someone who is required to follow directions with no questions asked.  you don't have to \"do what he tells you\".  what you should do is leave him.", "Ummmm, you're with this guy why? This isn't the first time you haven't done what he told you to? Why would you ever do anything just because some that told you to? This is the kind of controlling behavior that gonna lead to you wondering how you ended up in such an abusive relationship. NTA, but you will be if you don't cut him loose immediately.", "NTA unless you stay with that control freak", "NTA and your boyfriend is crazy.", "NTA. \n\nUmmm, no you don't need to EVER \"do what he asks of you.\"\n\nSure, in all sorts of relationships we do what people ask of us- we get up early to drive to the airport, we grab items from the store, we cook things the way they ask, we bring in items from another room, we avoid certain subjects with family members- but you do not have to do whatever he asks of you, and it isn't disrespectful not to follow his orders. Gross. \n\nHe asked you to stay in the car because of parking. You agreed but then realized that you may get fined anyway, so paid and parked. It would have been a problem if you had just left the car double parked or something, but you put the car in a safe and legal situation. \n\nIf this is the way he is speaking to you- respect him, do as you are told- you need to run girl.", "The fuck? NTA", "NTA. He seems to not value you as a partner with free will.", "NTA, unless he has communicated with you that he does not like PDA multiple times before, and this is not the first time your are ignoring him. \n\nWhat I noticed is that you do not say he was angry that you paid for the parking and wasted money, but that he was annoyed because you came into the restaurant and showed PDA in front of his relative. Did he ask you to stay in the car because he knew you would make him uncomfortable in front of his relative with your PDA?", "NTA OP; him claiming that \u201cYou don\u2019t listen to me\u201d is just stupid in my opinion because there are times where not listening can be a good thing. For instance; not going with somebody who wants you to go with them to an event where bad things are known to happen is a good choice because you\u2019re saving yourself. I\u2019m not saying that you should disobey people; but sometimes you gotta realise that people can be stupid without knowing it & this situation here is one of them.", "NTA. The only thing plausible is PDA if they have previously indicated they are uncomfortable with that. The rest of it sound quite controlling.", "NTA. He sounds like a controlling jackass and you need to take a hard look at this relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
