We used to have issues about keeping the house tidy, but now I'm not so uptight about it since his mess has never been an issue when I have people over.\n\nWe both pay 50/50 for rent. Chore-wise, it's suppose to be 50/50, but he's been falling behind. I don't pick up his slack, and he usually does it before it gets too bad. I've suggested us hiring a cleaner in the past, but he doesn't want to spend the money (he says paying for a cleaner would be equivalent of 2 months' worth of weed). I didn't argue since it doesn't affect me much. \n\nSo yesterday, his 3 friends came over to hang out. The house is, of course, a mess. Boyfriend wakes up when they come over. I retreat myself to my office.\n\nAfter 10 minutes, one of his friends knocks on my door, and explains that she is trying to cook but there's no space in the sink and the entire dishwasher is full. I tell her okay well why dont you guys order something or wait till Danny (my bf) finishes showering so he can wash them. That it's not my mess pile and basically danny left it in there all week because he was coming home at 10pm. She's like, \"Why can't you just do them?\". I was getting annoyed at this point and I sure won't be told what to do in my house so I told her back, \"Why can't you?\". \n\nShe said it wasn't her house or her mess. I didn't raise my voice. I just told her, \"Can you get the fuck out so I can finish playing Mobile Legends?\". \n\nI locked my door and finished playing on my phone. After my game was over, I phoned my bf (he was still in the shower) and let him know what happened. He said he was too tired to deal with this shit (the drama) right now but he's going to wash the dishes and cook when he gets out. \n\nHe came downstairs after the shower, and I went out with him (to get water and snacks), and it turns out she left. Boyfriend apologized to everyone for the mess and that he just had a busy week. His friends told him it wasn't cool of me telling her to fuck off. I doubled down and said to everyone that she's not welcome over agaun until she learns respect. \n\nAt the end of the day, my boyfriend is too tired to 'deal with this shit' as he's repeated for the 50th time lol. He texted the group that Sunday get-togethers aren't going to happen in our house anymore (his call, not mine). His friends were not happy and they can't watch on our big screen TV anymore. They hate me. AITA for how all this went down?\n\nEdit: The get-togethers on Sunday will still happen, but not at our place. His friends are upset because we have the bigger TV. I don't think it's permanent tho. I think now my boyfriend realizes how much of a problem his mess has gotten. I now feel bad for saying fuck off\n\nEdit 2: I don't dislike his friends. They watch sports for hours, which is something I'm not into", "created_utc": 1677520353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11di0sv/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_friend_to_fuck_off/", "score": 854, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree, that friend should only come back around when she's ready to bring an apology with her.", "NTA.

How is Danny too exhausted to do his damn dishes, but cool to take a shower and hang out? Who is this broad demanding access to your kitchen? How much weed is in play here to outspend housekeeping? And, most importantly -- is this really what you want out of life, OP? This?", "NTA. If she's comfortable enough to cook in your kitchen, she should've been comfortable enough to wash a few dishes. The conversation should have ended when you said, it's not my mess, you'll have to wait for Danny. Period, no more sassing or back talk. Like it or leave it, she's Danny's friend and it's Danny's problem. I would have told her to fuck off too. \n\nAnd WTF is wrong with your bf? He knew they were coming, he knew you try not to interact with them, and he decided to just sleep in until they got there and then just leave them to their own devices while he showered?? Who does that? I love my husband's friends, but I would be miffed if they showed up every Sunday and he just kinda .. left them to occupy our space while he checked out for a while.\n\nSeriously NTA.. glad he told them not to come back over. He sounds like he's over extending himself if he can't make time for basic human functions like chores and hygiene in a timely manner.", "NTA.  The friend was waaaay out of line.  I agree with previous posters\u2014your bf sounds lazy and selfish.  You deserve better than living in filth with a man who prioritizes weed over your quality of life.", "NTA. It\u2019s time for your boyfriend to grow up a bit with his home life. He\u2019s needs to learn to properly keep up with cleaning his messes, and hold himself accountable for the situation he\u2019s created with his friends, rather than letting them blame you. \n\nAs for the one friend, she was absolutely out of line for how she approached you. His friends sound entitled for how they think of and treat your home. It\u2019s clear his group expect you to be maintaining the house, it\u2019s his responsibility to make it clear to them you are not his nor their housekeeper. \n\nYou may need to sit down with him to discuss boundaries and expectations in these areas.

And asking you to clean you house for them is super weird.  They can do it.\n\n\nHowever- at the very end you mention Sunday get togethers and a big screen.  If you have a ritual and time they come over every week and make snacks to watch \u201csay football\u201d.

Honestly, you don't even sound like you like your bf.  His friend was a bit entitled asking you to clean so she could use someone else's kitchen.  You're bf sucks for not holding up his end of the bargain.  \n\nDividing chores is great, and is what should happen when you live together.  You say his mess is not your problem, but ultimately, if it's in a shared space (as opposed to his office or something), then it is your problem, because you live there too.\n\nAll of you sound quite immature honestly.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Mess happens, I get it, but your BF shouldn't have left you to deal with his friends. You clearly don't like them or you wouldn't have run off to the office.

You were also more rude than you needed to be.", "ESH. \n\n- That friend for asking, like if you\u2019re going to cook in someone\u2019s house you\u2019re clearly comfortable there. I would just do the dishes and maybe ask/talk about it with the friend later. Or I would just wait for my friend to come out of the shower.\n\n- You for telling her to fuck off. That person should\u2019ve asked you but you still could\u2019ve responded in a mature way. It\u2019s someone who is important to your bf, who asked you something that wasn\u2019t cool but wasn\u2019t a big deal either and you made it bigger than it needs to be by responding so rudely. \n\n- Your boyfriend for making it even a bigger deal by saying the get togethers won\u2019t happen at your house anymore. It seems petty and a dramatic. Though I empathize that he probably is going through something or his work and everything is getting too much. But I don\u2019t see why get togethers can\u2019t still just happen.\n\nNot to be mean but aren\u2019t you all adults? I think a mature conversation will sort all of this out", "I don't think in this situation you're the asshole for standing your ground as I sense your frustration and understand how that can be upsetting when it's supposed to be 50/50, with that being said when a partner falls behind sometimes I know within my own relationships and our ground rules if someone is having a busy/hard week sometimes you need to help them out as I would appreciate my partner doing the same for me if I was in their position. It's good your bf took responsibility and apologized to them for the mess, and if he had time for friends to come over should've made time to clean up as well. \n\n I think it's the way you reacted though, I don't know if I would be as bold as you and tell one of my partners friends to \"fuck off\" as that is their friend and they probably weren't aware of how your home and rules work. I would've went out and explained how it works and that he is grown up and responsible for his messes and this is between you and your partner not you and the friends, and since it's his mess not yours that's affecting them they need to discuss it with him because you have in the past and he knows the rules. I think you were a being a bit disrespectful here in the way you reacted and not her, and it's your boyfriend that needs to be responsible as it's his friends coming over and his mess as my mother used to tell me when I had friends over their my responsibility and whatever mess they make it also my mess now. I would apologize to the friend and not dictate who of your bf's friends are allowed to come over because of this though.", "Your boyfriend can get high all the time but he can't clean enough to the point where you have no clean dishes? You got bigger problems than one event.\n\nBut that girl is definitely TA too. She thinks she has a right to cook food at your house? She probably would have left all the dishes dirty before leaving too.\n\nNTA", "ESH. You could have explained to her without cussing to her face that it was his job, and due to private relationship dynamics, you do not pick up his unfinished chores.\n\n\nHis friend  should not have tried to drag you into whatever nonsense she was starting with, trying to cook without permission in someone else's home. I have the feeling it was basically sexist assumptions leading her to bother you about the mess.\n\nIf BF knew people were coming over, he should have made a greater effort to clean up in advance. \n\nEdits: I changed my mind from y.

A lot of people are managing their own care without much monitoring, let alone 'careful observation', because that sort of health care is not always available.\n\nYou should consider yourself very fortunate that to you it just seems a given that someone who has a problem is a. able to get access to medical care that they can afford and b. maintain that frequently to be under careful observation.
