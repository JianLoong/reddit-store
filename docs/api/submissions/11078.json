We used to have issues about keeping the house tidy, but now I'm not so uptight about it since his mess has never been an issue when I have people over.\n\nWe both pay 50/50 for rent. Chore-wise, it's suppose to be 50/50, but he's been falling behind. I don't pick up his slack, and he usually does it before it gets too bad. I've suggested us hiring a cleaner in the past, but he doesn't want to spend the money (he says paying for a cleaner would be equivalent of 2 months' worth of weed). I didn't argue since it doesn't affect me much. \n\nSo yesterday, his 3 friends came over to hang out. The house is, of course, a mess. Boyfriend wakes up when they come over. I retreat myself to my office.\n\nAfter 10 minutes, one of his friends knocks on my door, and explains that she is trying to cook but there's no space in the sink and the entire dishwasher is full. I tell her okay well why dont you guys order something or wait till Danny (my bf) finishes showering so he can wash them. That it's not my mess pile and basically danny left it in there all week because he was coming home at 10pm. She's like, \"Why can't you just do them?\". I was getting annoyed at this point and I sure won't be told what to do in my house so I told her back, \"Why can't you?\". \n\nShe said it wasn't her house or her mess. I didn't raise my voice. I just told her, \"Can you get the fuck out so I can finish playing Mobile Legends?\". \n\nI locked my door and finished playing on my phone. After my game was over, I phoned my bf (he was still in the shower) and let him know what happened. He said he was too tired to deal with this shit (the drama) right now but he's going to wash the dishes and cook when he gets out. \n\nHe came downstairs after the shower, and I went out with him (to get water and snacks), and it turns out she left. Boyfriend apologized to everyone for the mess and that he just had a busy week. His friends told him it wasn't cool of me telling her to fuck off. I doubled down and said to everyone that she's not welcome over agaun until she learns respect. \n\nAt the end of the day, my boyfriend is too tired to 'deal with this shit' as he's repeated for the 50th time lol. He texted the group that Sunday get-togethers aren't going to happen in our house anymore (his call, not mine). His friends were not happy and they can't watch on our big screen TV anymore. They hate me. AITA for how all this went down?\n\nEdit: The get-togethers on Sunday will still happen, but not at our place. His friends are upset because we have the bigger TV. I don't think it's permanent tho. I think now my boyfriend realizes how much of a problem his mess has gotten. I now feel bad for saying fuck off\n\nEdit 2: I don't dislike his friends. They watch sports for hours, which is something I'm not into", "created_utc": 1677520353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11di0sv/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_friend_to_fuck_off/", "score": 212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree, that friend should only come back around when she's ready to bring an apology with her.", "NTA.

She was rude to even suggest that you clean up the dishes just so that she can cook something.", "NTA, but are you all 12? How is Danny too exhausted to do his damn dishes, but cool to take a shower and hang out? Who is this broad demanding access to your kitchen? How much weed is in play here to outspend housekeeping? And, most importantly -- is this really what you want out of life, OP? This?", "NTA. If she's comfortable enough to cook in your kitchen, she should've been comfortable enough to wash a few dishes. The conversation should have ended when you said, it's not my mess, you'll have to wait for Danny. Period, no more sassing or back talk. Like it or leave it, she's Danny's friend and it's Danny's problem. I would have told her to fuck off too. \n\nAnd WTF is wrong with your bf? He knew they were coming, he knew you try not to interact with them, and he decided to just sleep in until they got there and then just leave them to their own devices while he showered?? Who does that? I love my husband's friends, but I would be miffed if they showed up every Sunday and he just kinda .. left them to occupy our space while he checked out for a while.\n\nSeriously NTA.. glad he told them not to come back over. He sounds like he's over extending himself if he can't make time for basic human functions like chores and hygiene in a timely manner.", "NTA.  The friend was waaaay out of line.  I agree with previous posters\u2014your bf sounds lazy and selfish.  You deserve better than living in filth with a man who prioritizes weed over your quality of life.", "NTA. It\u2019s time for your boyfriend to grow up a bit with his home life. He\u2019s needs to learn to properly keep up with cleaning his messes, and hold himself accountable for the situation he\u2019s created with his friends, rather than letting them blame you. \n\nAs for the one friend, she was absolutely out of line for how she approached you. His friends sound entitled for how they think of and treat your home. It\u2019s clear his group expect you to be maintaining the house, it\u2019s his responsibility to make it clear to them you are not his nor their housekeeper. \n\nYou may need to sit down with him to discuss boundaries and expectations in these areas.

And asking you to clean you house for them is super weird.  They can do it.\n\n\nHowever- at the very end you mention Sunday get togethers and a big screen.  If you have a ritual and time they come over every week and make snacks to watch \u201csay football\u201d.

Honestly, you don't even sound like you like your bf.  His friend was a bit entitled asking you to clean so she could use someone else's kitchen.  You're bf sucks for not holding up his end of the bargain.  \n\nDividing chores is great, and is what should happen when you live together.  You say his mess is not your problem, but ultimately, if it's in a shared space (as opposed to his office or something), then it is your problem, because you live there too.\n\nAll of you sound quite immature honestly.", "[deleted]", "ESH. Mess happens, I get it, but your BF shouldn't have left you to deal with his friends. You clearly don't like them or you wouldn't have run off to the office.

You were also more rude than you needed to be.", "ESH. \n\n- That friend for asking, like if you\u2019re going to cook in someone\u2019s house you\u2019re clearly comfortable there. I would just do the dishes and maybe ask/talk about it with the friend later. Or I would just wait for my friend to come out of the shower.\n\n- You for telling her to fuck off. That person should\u2019ve asked you but you still could\u2019ve responded in a mature way. It\u2019s someone who is important to your bf, who asked you something that wasn\u2019t cool but wasn\u2019t a big deal either and you made it bigger than it needs to be by responding so rudely. \n\n- Your boyfriend for making it even a bigger deal by saying the get togethers won\u2019t happen at your house anymore. It seems petty and a dramatic. Though I empathize that he probably is going through something or his work and everything is getting too much. But I don\u2019t see why get togethers can\u2019t still just happen.\n\nNot to be mean but aren\u2019t you all adults? I think a mature conversation will sort all of this out", "I don't think in this situation you're the asshole for standing your ground as I sense your frustration and understand how that can be upsetting when it's supposed to be 50/50, with that being said when a partner falls behind sometimes I know within my own relationships and our ground rules if someone is having a busy/hard week sometimes you need to help them out as I would appreciate my partner doing the same for me if I was in their position. It's good your bf took responsibility and apologized to them for the mess, and if he had time for friends to come over should've made time to clean up as well. \n\n I think it's the way you reacted though, I don't know if I would be as bold as you and tell one of my partners friends to \"fuck off\" as that is their friend and they probably weren't aware of how your home and rules work. I would've went out and explained how it works and that he is grown up and responsible for his messes and this is between you and your partner not you and the friends, and since it's his mess not yours that's affecting them they need to discuss it with him because you have in the past and he knows the rules. I think you were a being a bit disrespectful here in the way you reacted and not her, and it's your boyfriend that needs to be responsible as it's his friends coming over and his mess as my mother used to tell me when I had friends over their my responsibility and whatever mess they make it also my mess now. I would apologize to the friend and not dictate who of your bf's friends are allowed to come over because of this though.", "Your boyfriend can get high all the time but he can't clean enough to the point where you have no clean dishes? You got bigger problems than one event.\n\nBut that girl is definitely TA too. She thinks she has a right to cook food at your house? She probably would have left all the dishes dirty before leaving too.\n\nNTA", "ESH. You could have explained to her without cussing to her face that it was his job, and due to private relationship dynamics, you do not pick up his unfinished chores.\n\n\nHis friend  should not have tried to drag you into whatever nonsense she was starting with, trying to cook without permission in someone else's home. I have the feeling it was basically sexist assumptions leading her to bother you about the mess.\n\nIf BF knew people were coming over, he should have made a greater effort to clean up in advance. \n\nEdits: I changed my mind from y.

What\u2019s never ok is assuming it\u2019s solely the women\u2019s job to manage the house.", "I was really scared he was mad at me when I called him, and he said he didn't want to deal with this shit right now. Which was the drama he was referring to. So I went to get water when he came out. He confirmed he wasn't annoyed at me. He kicked everyone out when his other 2 friends complained how I treated her (I think she also exaggerated to them she tends to do that). Also, he cleaned his pile of dishes afterward. \n\nYeah, I agree very much! I'm planning for us to sit down soon and talk about him cleaning up after himself. And the peacemaking. I hope he can deal with his friends instead of putting it under the rug", "He really doesn't want more stress in his life right now. He kept the peace but at a cost. I think if he kept letting them (her specifically) come over he would be the doormat. This situation did make him realize his problem with the mess. \n\nSo I'm going to try to convince him to hire housecleaning again.", "I'm not sure now. She told me she wanted to cook and there was no space. I told her she can order something or wait until my boyfriend is done. I thought she would leave it at that. She said in a rude tone why couldn't I be the one to do the dishes instead. So I told her to fuck off \u2014 was really everything that went down", "[deleted]", "The thing is if it was his guy friend saying that instead, I would have told him to fuck off too. His friends don't clean up after themselves. At the end of a Sunday is like doing bottle service at a club. \n\nI feel that my boyfriend shouldn't have to clean up since he already has a problem with his mess. \n\n(But he doesn't mind because his friends would buy the food or cook it)", "[deleted]", "YTA. You clearly have no idea what partnership means. He works TWO jobs, and you can't clean a little extra mess so he can have a little down time on his ONE day off? So you let a mess pile up for a week? Not only are you an AH that doesn't know how to be a partner, you're kind of a nasty ass, too.", "NTA\nShe had a lot of nerve intruding into your quiet space to demand you get to work. There would have been no problem if she respected your privacy and autonomy.\nThis \"problem\" was 100% entitled friend deciding she could require your housekeeping services on her schedule.", "NTA - Why can\u2019t he get out of bed before his friends come over? I get he works a lot, but it only t takes a mi it\u2019s to do your dishes when you actually use them. It sounds like he is more concerned about his time to get stoned than to actually adult.", "NTA... Just state clearly that this is because BF is not doing his share of the chores.  When he resumes doing his share, then maybe you can have company over again.", "NTA .. you both should take thr new day off to recover together instead of having house guest.", "NTA. The audacity is ridiculous.", "NTA and let's play mobile legends together \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude01", "Is this...is this a mobile game ad?\n\nNTA, they sound extremely entitled.", "NTA. She fucked around and found out.", "NTA and kuddos to you for not breaking down and just cleaning up.  Your BF would totally take advantage of you if you did that.  My OCD would not let me do that and reading about the mess just made me shiver a bit.  That being said, I wouldn't tell my host to go wash dishes, I'd probably just wash them myself!  I have yet to come across someone that needs help say, 'no you can't wash my dishes!'", "I have worked 2 physical jobs with school and never left a kitchen like that. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live in that mess. NTA", "NTA, that girl sucks- but what about a new house rule that neither of you are allowed to have friends over unless you are both awake, showered/dressed, and both parties chores have been done? \n\nA lot of the problem here is that there was no one hosting his guests and they needed something and he was out of commission so they involved you. Seems easier to just not have people over unless the person whose guests it is is fully ready to be in host mode.", "If someone came into my house and told me to clean something, they would never step foot in my home again.", "I have questions. The going price of cleaners in my area is $25/hr, and they clean our apartment within 2 hours. They can't afford  that once every couple weeks because of a weed budget???", "If he didn't have to pay for weed he probably could work just 5 days a week...", "He can\u2019t work without weed?  That\u2019s an issue.", "You don\u2019t need a cleaner. Bro needs to get up off his ass and do 15-20 minutes worth of work. I get high and clean all the time.", "That didn\u2019t relate to just couples - they did studies showing pics of the same apartment - it was judged more harshly when the researchers said a woman lived there as opposed to a man. They were trying to see if there was a difference between cleanliness preferences between men and women (there were no notable differences it\u2019s just down to the individuals) but they did discover women were rated more harshly than men.", "You're 100% right. A lot of people get hung up on the \"there's no addictive chemical\" but they ignore psychological dependencies. It's no different to a gambling addiction, no chemicals there either. It's something that makes you feel good so your brain gets flooded with all those lovely hormones and gets addicted to that feeling. People can absolutely be addicted to something without it being a chemical addiction like nicotine or alcohol. Anyone who says different has either not done their homework or they're in denial.", "You are correct, this is an addiction / dependancy. This won't get better, so she need to decide how much time she wants to spend in a dirty house. He is grime blind at this point.", "Agree.  If he didn\u2019t smoke, how much quicker would he pay off his debts?", "If I want to make something at my mates and I need a dish I will just wash it. It's not hard to wash what you need.", "it wont get you downvoted, but i do want to tell you i think your take is stupid and uninformed", "Agree...but 13va_pop13va isnt wrong either in general...just may not be the case here", "He'd rather buy weed and live in filth than not buy weed and live in a clean home, but you don't think addiction is an issue?", "That\u2019s not the issue and if you can\u2019t see it, that\u2019s on you.", "But OP can be disrespectful towards a friend of not only her partner but the other person who pays half the bills of? I would apologize to my gf for this and then ask her to apologize to the friend who was clueless towards the house rules and was asking a simple question probably not out of rudeness or spite either towards someone who was in the home and wasn't aware of how they run things since her friend was in the shower.", "True. It may not be the case here. M89- thanks for the info on that study.", "the man works six days a week and does eventually get to his chores instead of pawning them off on op, per op's words. so no, i really don't think there's a problem", "I\u2019m sorry but no. She doesn\u2019t get to come into my home and disrespect me. Whether or not she knew the dynamics, she WAS disrespectful and out of order. Why do I have to be the bigger person to someone who is in my home, using my utilities, and is a guest in my home? If my boyfriend asked to apologize after his friend disrespected me, I\u2019d tell him to leave with her.\n\nMe and my cousin live in the same house, and pay the bills and rent 50/50. If one of my guest disrespected and she kicked them out, I wouldn\u2019t make her apologize because she has the right to be comfortable in her home", "I agree guests shouldn't have to clean up and I wouldn't expect my friends to ask me. \n\nBut when I'm over at my friends, I don't make a huge mess. I know they don't expect me to help, but I ask sometimes to be polite."]}
