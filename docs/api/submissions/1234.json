So you lied to your mother about who/how much, to get her to relinquish her beneficial ownership so the sale could go through? If so, she might have some legal standing to start trouble over this.\n\nClearly, this house should have been sold a long time ago so all of the involved parties could get their share and move on from the project.", "Yes YTA. \n\n> It wasn't an easy project because she didn't want to buy the whole house from us for herself (I asked about it from her several times), **but she didn't want to gave it up for free either.** \n\nWell of course not, why should she give it up for free?\n\n>she found a buyer who she thought would have bought the property for a higher amount than what I told her it was worth (told half of the real price).\n\nSo you lied to her...\n\n>Our mother also received a minimal amount (2.2% of the total purchase price)\n\nSo you could screw her out of money.", "You omitted and outright lied about the sale of property that your mother partially owned. How is this not fraud?   Yeah, sounds like she was a shit before about it, but your choices in the matter just create more problems, and potentially bad ones, for you.\n\nYTA", "Thank you.", "Thank you.", "Yes. \nBut I'm from Hungary and I'm not sure if I the benefocial ownership is the right name to use for that right what she had on the house.\nIn our country she could give that right for free as a gift for close relatives, so she and us do not need  to pay taxes after it, just for the whole purchase.\nBut hear me out. In that time she used the house it became a thing that a normal person wanted to destroy and build a whole new house instead.", "Eh. This system is the bane of Hungary. The beneficiary of use (NOT owner - beneficiary of use would probably be closer in translation) does not have any financial claim over the house in the event of its sale. They can use the house, rent it out, whatever, but not sell it. Funnily in other regards they have more rights than the owner though - for example if you are a tenant, this is the person who you go to to sign a lease with. The beneficiary of use does not change, even if the place is sold, pushing down the value of such a home. Unless they give it up willingly, otherwise it's a 'till death do us apart\" situation, unless unfaithful handling occurs, and then it's a messy law procedure.\n\nSo I can't exactly fault OP for using backhanded tactics.  As a Hungarian, I'd say maybe ESH would be a realistic choice here, even though, again, the mother does not have any financial claim on the money from the sale.\n\n(Although I wonder how mom could get herself loans with the house as \"insurance\". That seems to be not quite legal without OP's and siblings' agreement.)", "Thank you.\nBut please don't forget the fact she never payed anything for this house. Neither the taxes, neither the bills.\nThe final price was 22,126USD (we split it to three parts) and she had 491USD from us.", "Yes. \nBut I'm from Hungary and I'm not sure if I the benefocial ownership is the right name to use for that right what she had on the house.\nIn our country she could give that right for free as a gift for close relatives (children, parents), so she and us do not need  to pay taxes after it, just for the whole purchase for us and for the buyer.\nBut hear me out. In that time she used the house it became a thing that a normal person wanted to destroy and build a whole new house instead.\nSo the full ownership was ours, and her right was something like \"use the house if wanted, but needed to take care of it too\"."]}
