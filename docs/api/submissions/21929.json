I get that a lot of people have very close relationships with their family including cousins but I just get super uncomfortable whenever my bf is around his F(23) cousin (let\u2019s call her Emily). I didn\u2019t think anything of it at first because Emily and I get along well and she is super nice to me but they are first cousins and are super close with each other and it\u2019s kind of weird. They always say i love you and i love you so much to each other, and give each other kisses on the cheek to say goodbye. Whenever my bf and I are together, he asks do u wanna go to Emily\u2019s house and hang out i\u2019m bored, or we should go see Emily its gonna be so fun. And when we do end up going to Emily\u2019s house, I feel so excluded and they laugh at inside jokes that I\u2019m not a part of and never include me in the conversation. When we are at family events and Emily is there, he always leaves me behind and follows her everywhere, they even go to the toilet together\u2026 And yes without me there. This one other time, I was with my bf and Emily, and Emily gets up for no reason and sits in my bfs walk in wardrobe, then my bf follows her in and I hear them giggling from the inside for about 10 minutes. They come out and act like what they did wasn\u2019t super weird as I was literally sitting on the bed by myself super confused. The way he hugs her is like how he hugs me and she does that thing where she jumps into his arms and wraps her legs around her and since they look nothing alike, so many people that aren\u2019t close with him and I assume that they\u2019re the ones dating. To top things off Emily is on a holiday right now and will be gone for a month. When i tell you, that my bf every single day has mentioned that he is so jealous of her and that he misses her so much I mean this when I say everyday. I love my boyfriend so much and he means the world to me, so when I confronted him about it and he called me insecure and jealous and basically just got angry at me without understanding the situation or situations I mentioned, it really upset me and made me really suspicious of him because I feel like I can\u2019t talk to anyone about it.

It\u2019s just this inherent connection, though.

I have seen it done platonically and have done it drunk with the homies while out on the town as a goof.

Like i would expect children to act that way. \n\nThe ditching you at get togethers is rude af and weird (depending on how comfortable you are with his family.) My brother feels no obligation to hang around my SIL anymore even before they got married as she was comfortable around us. In the first couple years, of course, he was hy her side the whole time. \n\nThe hugging thing, i'm a very awkward person, and my positioning while hugging is often suspect. That being said, i would probably use duration to guage the weirdness of it. 1-2 seconds normal, 1-3 seconds if it has been a long time or they are leaving . 3-4 seconds for your birth giver, mom loves you and demands \"proper\" hugs. 5+ seconds for people who are dying, your intimate with or consoling.\n\nThe kissing on the cheek, hmmmmmmm.

Something like 30 to 50 percent of the kids in many areas of the country experiment with siblings and cousins.\n\nI also remember reading Sol Yoruk's *The Warriors* a few years ago and noting that much of what he wrote was taken from what he learned from interviewing gang members of the time.  In the end of the book, a guy is lying with his sister in a bed or fold-out couch, and it is implied that they sleep together.  He had found that due to cramped quarters, these things happened more often than not.\n\nAlso, I did know someone who frequently had sex with his second cousin.  He was a friend from college.  His family had old money.  Like, maids, multiple classic cars in large garages, impossible to find online, exclusive country club membership money.", "What's the odds it used to be but all the jokes made it unpopular enough for rates to go down?", "I\u2019m a therapist, and yeah, it\u2019s insanely common.", "I fake married my cousin when I was 4-5. After that age, ick.", "Idk wasn't there a whole family of blue people in Missouri?? Mississippi? Because they literally just kept inbreeding with each other? Maybe they used Alabama to draw attention away from that lol", "Kentucky. The Fugates.", "Methemoglobinemia", "Yes! Them! If any state should be the butt end of an incest joke it should be Kentucky then, cuz they had *blue people*", "There's an area where I live that's referred to as \"kentucky\" bc of the type of people you'll find there more often than not"]}
