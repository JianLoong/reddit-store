His mother didn\u2019t want me to be involved in the care of their child, and she and I have never really seen eye-to-eye. In the beginning, it went really well and his son was here every other week, but the older he got the less time he was with his mom and he\u2019s with us 100% now since his mom was arrested a year ago.In the beginning, we divided the chores and child care equally. 4 months ago my boyfriend got an opportunity to work on 3 projects, which could lead him to a big promotion.\n\nHe\u2019s always working late, either from home or in the office. I\u2019ve been doing all the chores and childcare since then. I cook, clean, get his son ready in the morning, and drop him off at daycare. The only thing my boyfriend has to do is get his son ready for bed.I told him last Friday that from Monday on I won\u2019t be doing the childcare anymore. He got angry, he said that we\u2019re a family and we need to support each other. He told me he needed me right now and that I just need to be patient.I replied saying that this is his son and he needed to do the majority of the childcare. \n\nI\u2019ve been doing all of it and it\u2019s not fair since he is his father.He then went into the other room, got his son, and told his son that \u201cMommy says she doesn\u2019t want to take care of you anymore\u201d while pointing at me. I said to not call me that because I\u2019m not his mother and his son started crying. I of course comforted and apologized to his son, because it wasn\u2019t my intention to upset him.My boyfriend is still mad and has been taking care of his son, but won\u2019t speak to me. \n\nI didn\u2019t think this was unreasonable, he is the parent and needs to do more of the child care. And also the mom doesn\u2019t even want me to be involved in child care, so I\u2019m already overstepping her wishes. My sister is on his side and says I\u2019m at fault since he and I are a family now, and he needs my support right now. And that the mother\u2019s wishes don\u2019t matter at all right now. Like I don't think this was at all unreasonable, but I\u2019m not sure if I was unreasonable here, AITA?", "created_utc": 1691081426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h9d88/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You now have a decision to make about your relationship. Because if it continues as is, you are the primary parent.

He is working hard to provide for his family and secure a promotion. He may feel like he doesn't have enough time or energy to do everything he needs to do. He may also feel guilty or scared about his son's situation with his mother. He is not an asshole for wanting your support and help.\n\nThe problem is that you both have different expectations and needs in the relationship, and you are not communicating them effectively. You both feel resentful and hurt by the other's actions.

This is not something you anticipated ever doing. \n\nDoes his son have any other family?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His mother didn\u2019t want me to be involved in the care of their child, and she and I have never really seen eye-to-eye. In the beginning, it went really well and his son was here every other week, but the older he got the less time he was with his mom and he\u2019s with us 100% now since his mom was arrested a year ago.   \nIn the beginning, we divided the chores and child care equally. 4 months ago my boyfriend got an opportunity to work on 3 projects, which could lead him to a big promotion.  \nHe\u2019s always working late, either from home or in the office. I\u2019ve been doing all the chores and childcare since then. I cook, clean, get his son ready in the morning, and drop him off at daycare. The only thing my boyfriend has to do is get his son ready for bed.   \nI told him last Friday that from Monday on I won\u2019t be doing the childcare anymore. He got angry, he said that we\u2019re a family and we need to support each other. He told me he needed me right now and that I just need to be patient.  \nI replied saying that this is his son and he needed to do the majority of the childcare. I\u2019ve been doing all of it and it\u2019s not fair since he is his father.  \nHe then went into the other room, got his son, and told his son that \u201cMommy says she doesn\u2019t want to take care of you anymore\u201d while pointing at me. I said to not call me that because I\u2019m not his mother and his son started crying. I of course comforted and apologized to his son, because it wasn\u2019t my intention to upset him.   \nMy boyfriend is still mad and has been taking care of his son, but won\u2019t speak to me.  \nI didn\u2019t think this was unreasonable, he is the parent and needs to do more of the child care.  \nAnd also the mom doesn\u2019t even want me to be involved in child care, so I\u2019m already overstepping her wishes.  \nMy sister is on his side and says I\u2019m at fault since he and I are a family now, and he needs my support right now. And that the mother\u2019s wishes don\u2019t matter at all right now.   \nLike I don't think this was at all unreasonable, but I\u2019m not sure if I was unreasonable here, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Assuming the mother of the child is not in for life, she will come back at some point and may want to reclaim the child (Good possibility since OP has not seen her eye to eye about anything, and mother never wanted her baby to be raised by OP). If the OP takes up the mother's role whole heartedly, she will get heartbroken when the child's mother comes back. She doesn't mind helping her BF, but has currently taken over a major role in raising the child causing her to be resentful about it. Why are none of his family members involved in raising the child? Why isn't the child's mother's family involved at all? Why has the major burden fallen on OP? \n\nSecond thing, I would surely mind, if the person I am dating since 4 years, has basically dumped his kid from a previous relationship and all home chores on me, without any commitment from his end. This says you are NOT A FAMILY yet (I don't know why he and OP's sister refer to this as family). If someone wants me to take care of his kid (that I did not give birth to) and his home, he'd better worship the ground that I  walk on and propose to me asap instead of asking me to be patient. And also talk about legally adopting the child so its mama cannot hurt you. \n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if the child was OP's bio baby. He is still a father and has fatherly duties towards his child and needs to do the childcare and home chores. Period. And to talk to the baby in the emotional heat that mama doesn't love you, he is being assuming that OP should take mother's role without talking to her and when she refuses, he gaslights her. He is manipulative and entitled. NAH for that. \n\nWhat about OP's career? She has not mentioned how it is affecting her life and goals. Pretty sure, she would get overwhelmed if she has to take care of home, a child and work with bare minimum help. Is that how it will be if and when OP wants their own children? If that is how it is going to be, OP should reconsider the whole relationship. Its truth of life that what we think love is, is not enough to sustain us for our entire life. \n\nI respect ambition. However, when his crushes yours, you are demoted to a door mat. There is never a guarantee of a guy treating you well when reaches the top when you have been the support system that got him there.

If YOU don\u2019t, then who? It sounds like forcing your bf to stop and potentially lose a promotion and back out if projects sounds like a bad idea in the longterm. If you are committed to this relationship and plan to marry him at some point, then that means being committed to his son as well. If you cannot do that, it\u2019s better to break up now and stop dating people who have kids. \n\nBF: He fucking traumatised his son in an attempt to make a point and the son did not need to be involved in that argument at all.

Sure, it's a lot and overwhelming, but you don't get to walk away with a weekend's notice from a child you've been caring for for the last 4 years.", "She works.

Of course he\u2019ll expect more out of you now", "I get where you\u2019re coming from and in no way am I condoning the emotional manipulation in any sense, that\u2019s a huge red flag and something to be considered. I\u2019m just going by the blanket statement that if you date someone with a child, they first of all need to inform that they have a child from the very get go and if you choose to proceed then that\u2019s entirely on you and to be expected that the child will be a part of your life in some form. I\u2019m terms if this relationship it\u2019s a difficult one because she\u2019s been a parental figure for so long, it\u2019s gonna be messy either way, but the way he\u2019s reacted and used the child is not on at all and a huge red flag in my eyes. Personally this doesn\u2019t seem like a healthy relationship for anyone involved, but to just one day say after 4 years you don\u2019t wanna look after the child anymore is a bit wack, I feel like they\u2019ve been together long enough now that you can\u2019t just one day drop those responsibilities as a parental figure. Either way I feel there\u2019s gonna be an aftermath, but I would seriously consider whether I\u2019d want to be in a relationship with someone like that on both counts.", "She\u2019s in jail I don\u2019t think she has that much say over the child care anymore", "Really?

Plus, this person already doesn\u2019t view this child as her own, I can just tell so I think she needs to move on with her life from this. idk if it\u2019s just bc my step mom never really liked me(known her since I was 2, now 25) so I\u2019ve felt that \u201cI only really care about you bc your my husbands kid\u201d vibe before and it\u2019s not fun. her story gives me similar vibes", "I\u2019m so glad this comment was made!

That makes me very, very nervous, and he\u2019s already shown he\u2019ll use the kid against her.

At 6, shouldn\u2019t the child be in school?", "OK, I would ask to see if he could split the chores with you, or could hire a cleaner if that would help. And then maybe you could continue to split the childcare as it sounds like the kid is attached to you", "This", "She should've left 4 years ago", "4 years ago both parents said they didn\u2019t want her to parent. That\u2019s their right. And when that changed she did step up. \n\nWhat concerns me is the BF\u2019s more recent behavior."]}
