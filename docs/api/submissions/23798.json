His mother didn\u2019t want me to be involved in the care of their child, and she and I have never really seen eye-to-eye. In the beginning, it went really well and his son was here every other week, but the older he got the less time he was with his mom and he\u2019s with us 100% now since his mom was arrested a year ago.In the beginning, we divided the chores and child care equally. 4 months ago my boyfriend got an opportunity to work on 3 projects, which could lead him to a big promotion.\n\nHe\u2019s always working late, either from home or in the office. I\u2019ve been doing all the chores and childcare since then. I cook, clean, get his son ready in the morning, and drop him off at daycare. The only thing my boyfriend has to do is get his son ready for bed.I told him last Friday that from Monday on I won\u2019t be doing the childcare anymore. He got angry, he said that we\u2019re a family and we need to support each other. He told me he needed me right now and that I just need to be patient.I replied saying that this is his son and he needed to do the majority of the childcare.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing all of it and it\u2019s not fair since he is his father.He then went into the other room, got his son, and told his son that \u201cMommy says she doesn\u2019t want to take care of you anymore\u201d while pointing at me. I said to not call me that because I\u2019m not his mother and his son started crying. I of course comforted and apologized to his son, because it wasn\u2019t my intention to upset him. My boyfriend is still mad and has been taking care of his son, but won\u2019t speak to me.\n\nI didn\u2019t think this was unreasonable, he is the parent and needs to do more of the child care. And also the mom doesn\u2019t even want me to be involved in child care, so I\u2019m already overstepping her wishes. My sister is on his side and says I\u2019m at fault since he and I are a family now, and he needs my support right now. And that the mother\u2019s wishes don\u2019t matter at all right now. Like I don't think this was at all unreasonable, but I\u2019m not sure if I was unreasonable here, AITA?\n\n**- I see a lot of you asking if I work. I do, I'm giving at-home care to the elderly and disabled. I've lowered the number of hours that I work to 20-28 hours per week. How demanding my work is, truly depends on the day, and which client I have on my schedule. Sometimes I have clients on my schedule that don't require a lot of time and I'm finished by 12 PM and the other times I have to work until 8 pm. It really varies per day.**", "created_utc": 1691081426, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h9d88/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 7145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, you did not sign up for the child's actual parent to basically put all the responsibility on YOU. I'm sure you are just fed up with being the primary caretaker of a child which was kind of thrust on you due to the changes in his actual parent's lives. You now have a decision to make about your relationship. Because if it continues as is, you are the primary parent.

You are not his son's mother, and you have been taking on a lot of responsibility for his care. It's understandable that you feel overwhelmed and want your boyfriend to step up more. You are not an asshole for wanting that.\n\nHowever, I also think that your boyfriend is under a lot of stress and pressure right now. He is working hard to provide for his family and secure a promotion. He may feel like he doesn't have enough time or energy to do everything he needs to do. He may also feel guilty or scared about his son's situation with his mother. He is not an asshole for wanting your support and help.\n\nThe problem is that you both have different expectations and needs in the relationship, and you are not communicating them effectively.

When dating someone who has kids and living together in this fashion, you are the mom and you guys are a family. I can see why you\u2019re frustrated and any women(or mom) in that situation would be frustrated. Biological kid or not. Taking care of a child is tough. But it sounds like now that this boys mom isn\u2019t around anymore, you\u2019re stepping into that role whether you want to or not.

His mother didn\u2019t want me to be involved in the care of their child, and she and I have never really seen eye-to-eye. In the beginning, it went really well and his son was here every other week, but the older he got the less time he was with his mom and he\u2019s with us 100% now since his mom was arrested a year ago.   \nIn the beginning, we divided the chores and child care equally. 4 months ago my boyfriend got an opportunity to work on 3 projects, which could lead him to a big promotion.  \nHe\u2019s always working late, either from home or in the office. I\u2019ve been doing all the chores and childcare since then. I cook, clean, get his son ready in the morning, and drop him off at daycare. The only thing my boyfriend has to do is get his son ready for bed.   \nI told him last Friday that from Monday on I won\u2019t be doing the childcare anymore. He got angry, he said that we\u2019re a family and we need to support each other. He told me he needed me right now and that I just need to be patient.  \nI replied saying that this is his son and he needed to do the majority of the childcare. I\u2019ve been doing all of it and it\u2019s not fair since he is his father.  \nHe then went into the other room, got his son, and told his son that \u201cMommy says she doesn\u2019t want to take care of you anymore\u201d while pointing at me. I said to not call me that because I\u2019m not his mother and his son started crying. I of course comforted and apologized to his son, because it wasn\u2019t my intention to upset him.   \nMy boyfriend is still mad and has been taking care of his son, but won\u2019t speak to me.  \nI didn\u2019t think this was unreasonable, he is the parent and needs to do more of the child care.  \nAnd also the mom doesn\u2019t even want me to be involved in child care, so I\u2019m already overstepping her wishes.  \nMy sister is on his side and says I\u2019m at fault since he and I are a family now, and he needs my support right now. And that the mother\u2019s wishes don\u2019t matter at all right now.   \nLike I don't think this was at all unreasonable, but I\u2019m not sure if I was unreasonable here, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Assuming the mother of the child is not in for life, she will come back at some point and may want to reclaim the child (Good possibility since OP has not seen her eye to eye about anything, and mother never wanted her baby to be raised by OP). If the OP takes up the mother's role whole heartedly, she will get heartbroken when the child's mother comes back. She doesn't mind helping her BF, but has currently taken over a major role in raising the child causing her to be resentful about it. Why are none of his family members involved in raising the child? Why isn't the child's mother's family involved at all? Why has the major burden fallen on OP?\n\nSecond thing, I would surely mind, if the person I am dating since 4 years, has basically dumped his kid from a previous relationship and all home chores on me, without any commitment from his end. This says you are NOT A FAMILY yet (I don't know why he and OP's sister refer to this as family). If someone wants me to take care of his kid (that I did not give birth to) and his home, he'd better worship the ground that I  walk on and propose to me asap instead of asking me to be patient. And also talk about legally adopting the child so its mama cannot hurt you.\n\nAlso, it doesn't matter if the child was OP's bio baby. He is still a father and has fatherly duties towards his child and needs to do the childcare and home chores. Period. And to talk to the baby in the emotional heat that mama doesn't love you, he is being assuming that OP should take mother's role without talking to her and when she refuses, he gaslights her. He is manipulative and entitled. NAH for that.\n\nWhat about OP's career? She has not mentioned how it is affecting her life and goals. Pretty sure, she would get overwhelmed if she has to take care of home, a child and work with bare minimum help. Is that how it will be if and when OP wants their own children? If that is how it is going to be, OP should reconsider the whole relationship. Its truth of life that what we think love is, is not enough to sustain us for our entire life.\n\nI respect ambition. However, when his crushes yours, you are demoted to a door mat. There is never a guarantee of a guy treating you well when reaches the top when you have been the support system that got him there. So let him pull his own weight.\n\nEdit: I read in one of the comments that OP lowered her hours to care for the child and household expenses are still 60:40. BF can basically ride out in sun for the glory. This sounds like all marriages where husband works and wife is a stay at home mum, so she has to take up every responsibility in the house other than bringing in the money. That is not fair to SAHMs and it is not fair to OP either. She is most certainly not unreasonable. After she called out on the BF, he takes care of his child and refuses to speak with her. Which means that he can do both, but is mad about loosing free childcare.", "ESH\n\nBoth of you are on opposite extremes.\n\nYou: Surely by now you realize that your bf and his son are a joint package 4 years and living together? You *are* a family. I get it, you\u2019re doing the most of it rn but keep in mind it sounds like the projects he is doing at work is keeping him from being able to do so and is temporary. If YOU don\u2019t, then who? It sounds like forcing your bf to stop and potentially lose a promotion and back out if projects sounds like a bad idea in the longterm. If you are committed to this relationship and plan to marry him at some point, then that means being committed to his son as well. If you cannot do that, it\u2019s better to break up now and stop dating people who have kids. \n\nBF: He fucking traumatised his son in an attempt to make a point and the son did not need to be involved in that argument at all.

It\u2019s unfair for the boyfriend to expect that she can continue this without help, especially if she\u2019s had to back down on hours at her own job in order to be there for his son.

Figure it out as of tomorrow.\"", "If you date someone that has children for 4+ years then you are basically that child's step parent. Especially when they've been in the child's life at such a young age. You should not date a parent if you aren't willing to be partially responsible for their child at some point.", "My stepdad was my stepdad long before he married my mother. \n\nOP has been with this man for 4 years, and for as long as the kid remembers. She\u2019s his stepmom.", "If you date somebody with a kid for years that child becomes your responsibility", "It seems to me like OP and her partner have not clearly laid out what was going to happen if he took this opportunity. Either they didn't communicate at all, or the communication wasn't very good/clear/truthful. \n\nIf the communication was clear though and the expectations were set beforehand and OP agreed to them, she could well be the AH for getting angry at him for not taking up more childcare. \n\nBut, after the part where he pulls in the kid, I doubt that is what happened and instead the partner is a bad communicator. Pulling the child in between is a major no-no.", "Years ago we used to say, \u201cThis child is going to end up on Oprah some day.\u201d", "It seems like that wasn\u2019t the agreement made by them. The BM didn\u2019t even want OP parenting the child at all. It looks to me like it was somewhat expected by him. At 1st they split everything equally, then he gets a chance at a promotion and suddenly she\u2019s carrying most of the weight. That wasn\u2019t what she agreed to.", "I hate to say it, but this kid is fucked. My counselling tutor adopted her daughter when she was still a baby, and she's 10 now with a ton of problems stemming from attachment issues. With a mother who's qualified in person-centered and psychodynamic therapy (as well as being a patient, kind-hearted human) the kid is still messed up from losing her birth mother during early development.\n\nWith so few experiences, things like this happening to kids really does become a part of who they are. My heart breaks for him.\n\nI hope OP knows that she cannot save this kid. She can only save herself.", "I completely agree", "Just this. I\u2019d be telling him he needs to put a ring on it so she\u2019s protected financially. She\u2019s working fewer hours at a very demanding job. If the relationship breaks up, she\u2019s screwed. I hate to see them break up just because it will be another trauma suffered by that child. Don\u2019t either of the adults have any problem solving skills?  Why can\u2019t they hire child care for a few hours a day or talk to friends and relatives about short term help? If that\u2019s not possible financially, then dad needs to ratchet back at work to help out at home. It may mean getting ahead/promotion falls to second priority. If he so keen on keeping the family together, he needs to act like it.", "That sounds like a him problem, not a you problem.", "What?? Lots of people are step parents before having a child of their own. Do you mean to say that nobody without children should ever marry someone with children? Unless they\u2019re 40 or over?", "Who wants to be a bangmaid? Nobody", "This exactly! I was hoping someone would address the fact that she IS that boy's mom at this point, biologically or not. If OP isn't ready for that then she definitely needs to leave the relationship because the boy and his father are a package deal. And yes, the father was a huge asshole for using his son to manipulate OP.", "When she started dating him, the situation was much different. It doesn't sound like she ever agreed to this situation.", ">If you don\u2019t want to parent then don\u2019t date a parent.\n\nAs a now adult daughter of divorced parents: THIS!!!\n\nMy mom once dated a guy who didn't get along with children, never ever do this. He was the reason I for the first and last time shouted at someone so much my mom got concerned asking what's wrong and separated not long after. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with not wanting to do 100% of the work. There's a *a lot* wrong with dating a parent when you don't want to be involved with parenting at all. I've been on the other end and the only not A H here is the kid, I feel sorry for him. ESH", "I agree and was looking for this take. You\u2019ve been a part of this kids life for as long as he can remember. It\u2019s ok to not want to take on all the responsibility of parenting, to need a partner who pulls their weight, but\u2026what are you to this babe if you aren\u2019t his step parent? Do you not love him? Do you not find time with him rewarding? Who just decides \u201cI\u2019m tired of taking care of you now. I\u2019m done.\u201d He\u2019s not a doll to play with and then set down?\n\nESH except this poor kid whose caught in the web of adults who aren\u2019t grown up.", "that's also what struck me most, definitely.", "I would also like to know if OP is paying half the bills, or any at all! She shouldn't be.\n\nAnyway, I would leave because I wouldn't want a man that could wound his child just to manipulate me... \"mommy doesn't want to take care of you anymore!\"... WTF dude. \n\nOP, you can't have children with this person. That is a horrific thing to say to a child that certainly already feels unloved and unimportant to his bio mum.", "Same, stepmom here and was team ESH until that. You\u2019re absolutely spot on with your comment.", "Even if they were committed it is wrong to leave all the childcare to one person. She was doing EVERYTHING. He literally would just come home and put his kid to bed. That\u2019s wrong and bad even in a marriage", "Weaponizing your child and your child's emotions. I call it emotional hostage taking. It's abuse, is what it is.", "OP NTA\n\nI hope you never have children with this AH. If he\u2019s manipulating his own son, think about how he will manipulate any children you have together. Then it will be, you have to take care of our child, you have to take care of mine too. It\u2019s downright cruel, malicious and child abuse.", "I kind of agree with you.   I was leaning towards Every1Sucks.    His response, by bringing his son literally into the room and being emotionally manipulative and abusive to them both, makes him the biggest AH by far, and has me assuming (i know, i know never ASS U ME) this has already been a topic of disagreement.  \n\nINFO: has the child been calling you Mommy?   did you agree to exactly 4 months of doing the extra work?   did he get the promotion, or is he \u201cstill working towards it\u201d?   \n\nEven if OP did only spring her decision on him for the first time, which is an AH move, the response overshadows her AHishness.  OP, I don\u2019t think you should care what bio-mom\u2019s wishes were/are, she should consider herself lucky that her child had you.   It is okay if the last 4 months have shown you what a potential future with this man is going to be like and you don\u2019t want it anymore.  He has certainly proven why you\u2019ve second guessed the situation.", "A lot of the comments here honestly scream to me Yes Queen energy. Fuck emotion. Be a boss ass bitch while we ignore the fact you gave your partner of 4 years an ultimatum that you would not look after this child that has been in her life for atleast 4 years. \n\nDudes probably thinking if he can get this promotion, he can set up their lives or at least make it easier, than boom \"Im not looking after your son any longer\". \n\nAlso re reading the OG poster, they take the kid to daycare in the morning. Reading some of these NA posts youd think hes chained her up to look after his son all day long. \n\nMy take on it is they both are arseholes.", "No he\u2019s definitely wasting her time. Dude is using her as a nanny and maid", "Then don't date someone who has kids. It's that simple.", "It would be impossible, at least for the kid, to not be bonded over a 4 year span", "That doesn't mean OP wasn't a bit of an asshole. That's quite literally the point of the ESH ruling.", "Thank you! The reduced earnings is a MASSIVE red flag.", "I always said that stepparents are the substitute teachers of the parenting world.", "You should read Sarah Stickney Ellis's book \"The Women of England.\" It's a conduct book from the victorian era on how to be the perfect woman/the angel of domestic bliss, and your description of what is expected of you sounds very similar to what Ellis also expected of women.", "This is great comment, if only more women would take this advice! Many women gets label of evil step mom because it's the men who put them in such situations, I'm just surprised at why women take these things without any pushback. And at the same time these men would blame women for not working at jobs that make more money or sacrifice their family time for career growth etc, it's from these same men whose ok with unequal pay for women cause women don't work long hours like men. This thing just go in full cycles -the men just kept getting benefits while women gets short of of stick every time.", ">being a fulltime parent, **if the need arises**\n\nIf you're going to quote me, please take the full quote.\n\nIf my partner ends up in the hospital for some reason and the father of the child is away, I'm next in line to take responsibility of childcare. I'm not saying being a stepfather or stepmother means you have to take up 100% of the childcare all the time, I'm saying you have to willing to take that burden if it happens due to circumstance.", "Yeah, they\u2019re not even married. She\u2019s raising his child and sacrificing her earning potential for him to succeed in his career, he could just up and leave her at any time.

He should have stepped up", "Harsh for the kid though you got to admit. Raised since he was 2 years old by OP and sees her as his mum.
