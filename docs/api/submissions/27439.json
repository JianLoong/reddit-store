The same cannot be said of alcohol poisoning which can come on way quicker than most people think and cause serious injury.\n\nYou think of alcohol and weed as normal and pretty safe because there are legal avenues to purchase them (in some places) allowing for cleaner safer products and their use has been relatively normalized so the general population has a better understanding of the risks and how to use it safely.\n\nWhy take drugs? Literally thousands of different reasons, both valid and ridiculous. Humanity has been getting high since the dawn of civilization, some of the first permanent human settlements were built to more easily make beer, the Oracle was huffing ethylene in the temple of Delphi, some of the greatest poetry of the Victorian age were written by guys who were constantly smoking opium, Freud would probably have never created psychoanalysis (and the entire modern profession of psychiatry) without the mountain of cocaine he and his colleagues consumed, Steve Jobs said LSD was one of the most profound experiences of his life. \n\nI'm not saying there's no merit to telling your kids to stick to weed and alcohol and that other substances are dangerous, that's a pretty normal belief. However I wish more people understood that stance gives the impression that weed and alcohol are mostly safe and any other drugs are \"hard\" and extremely dangerous which is just incorrect. Just because you've never found a reason to do drugs doesn't mean your kids won't and when they take a risk and try MDMA or something, odds are they'll have a great time and come out the other side fine, immediately making them think your whole drug stance was full of shit and possibly engage in more dangerous behavior. I think people in general would be a lot better off if they were told the truth: that no mind altering substance, whether it's coffee or heroin, is completely safe but some are significantly more risky than others which is why if you do choose to use a psychoactive substance it is extremely important to know exactly what you are taking, how much you are taking, and follow proper harm reduction practices for the substance in question.

It's not ever about controlling what another person does. \n\nWhen you give someone an ultimatum or tell them they can't do something, you are trying to control their behaviour. Which is by its very definition \"controlling\". If the term is endlessly thrown around, that's because people are educating themselves around what unhealthy behaviours look like within relationships, and they're calling it out. \n\n\"You can't do that or I'm breaking up with you\" \n\nVs\n\n\"I can't be in a relationship with someone who takes hard drugs\"\n\nOne is an attempt at controlling someone else's behaviour.

That\u2019s respecting her choice and making your own choice based off of it. Not telling her to change her behavior. She can then make her own choice based on her limits. There is a major difference there. One is choosing what to do with your own body and autonomy. The other is trying to tell HER what to do. It\u2019s not pedantic. It\u2019s literally the difference between having boundaries and being controlling.\n\nEdit: part of that is that telling them you\u2019ll leave genuinely has to be your own boundary, not something you do to manipulate them into changing. It is a non-judgmental limit of yours. Not a way to strongarm them. Obviously you hope you are able to find a middle path, but you are also open to not. It\u2019s not coercive.", "A boundary is not telling someone what they can and can\u2019t do. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.

Mushrooms are very dangerous, I've known several people who have never come back from trips and a couple who severely harmed themselves, as in mutilated themselves. That's very unlikely with MDMA so the main argument he has is that it could be cut with something but he'd let her take a potentially mental health destroying trip with him so I don't think he has the moral high ground here.
