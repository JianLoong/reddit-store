The funeral was in another state, but close enough that it would just be a day trip. I was coordinating with family about when the funeral was and when I would be able to arrive, plus letting them know that  I had a couple of friends planning to attend with me. \n\nMy Aunt (Uncle's sister) reached out to me and asked me to not bring my service dog, but I did not feel comfortable leaving the state to attend an event that was going to be highly emotionally charged, as well as spend time outside in the Southern Mid-West USA heat. She explained that she just didn't have the emotional bandwidth to deal with me having my service dog, plus, since I was bringing friends, they could keep an eye on me.  \n\nMy issue is that by the time people realize that something is wrong, it is to the point that they are making me comfortable while we wait for the ambulance to take me to the ER. I don't like going to the Emergency Room, much less to an ER in another state.  My dog alerts me and my friends to medical issues early enough that we can address them before I collapse or lose consciousness.  \n\nMy aunt is one of those who believes people have service dogs because they want attention, not because the dogs are actually trained to perform a service (with the exception of blind guide dogs).\n\nAnytime I do a family event with them, I have to do so without my service dog. When I refused to attend without my SD, she informed me I was not welcome to attend any of the family events outside of the funeral. (i.e., the lunch and family gathering at a public restaurant).\n\nOnly 1 cousin, on that side of the family, along with my sister and her family, will have anything to do with me since then. \n\nI may be TA because I refused to attend a family funeral without my service dog.\n\nEdit to include link to puppy tax pictures \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/14g7six/oc_rocky_pictures_for_tax/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "created_utc": 1687435355, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g1npm/aita_for_refusing_to_attend_a_family_funeral/", "score": 197, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you can't bring your service dog, your medical equipment, to an event, then it's not worth going to.", "NTA. Your dog is effectively a medical device. It sounds to me that you're better off without your aunt and those other family members that back up her repulsive behavior. She sounds like a boat rocker.", "NTA- she thinks the service dog is for attention, but surely you having a medical episode in the middle of the funeral would attract way more attention? Or does she think you are faking that too?\n\nWhat have your parents said about this? Have they stood up for you?", "NTA but your aunt is definitely the AH. Maybe you can provide her with some information about what service dogs actually do? I wouldn't sweat this, it sounds like people you don't actually need to be around anyway.", "NTA.  These people are ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nYour dog I\u2019m sure is wonderful, but is also a medical support tool for a condition that you have, that presumably may additionally be instigated by stress. This is like asking someone with asthma to leave their inhaler behind whilst on a trip. If they cannot understand that, that\u2019s their problem.", "NTA. If this is a service animal that has been trained to alert you on medical issues, then there\u2019s absolutely no reason to ask you not to bring the dog.", "NTA.  A service dog is official, unlike the highly suspect emotional support animals...some can be official, most are not.  Your service animal is supposed to be treated as you would a wheelchair or other health aide required to live a fairly normal life.  Not to mention the $3000 minimum, it would cost for the aforementioned ambulance ride.  What do they expect?  If anything they are expressing their regret that they cannot accommodate your needs, so in essence you aren't invited.  They are the AHs.", "NTA. If your dog is truly a trained service dog, then you have a legal right to take him/her just about anywhere you need to be. Unfortunately, that won\u2019t stop your aunt from creating a scene. Unless you absolutely feel the need to attend the funeral, I simply would not go. If anyone asks why, tell them your health prevents you from traveling without your service dog and since he/she wasn\u2019t welcome, you felt the best thing to do was stay home.

She probably told them or let them assume you didn\u2019t care to come, not about you just actually kindly respecting her wishes. She didn\u2019t require any bandwidth to have you attend with your dog except what she invented in her head. She gets a pass at the time because she just lost someone, but to hold a grudge afterwards makes all of them TA.", "NTA: \n\nAbsolutely not the AH, you have medical needs that require a service animal. They're showing how uneducated they are, how ignorant they are. Your aunt is showing how entitled she is to demanding that a person with serious medical issues leaves their service dog at home, your dog alerts you to issues before they happen and helps you. Your aunt & family are serious AH's. They need to educate themselves before demanding someone leaves their service animal at home. Good on your cousin and sister for being there for you.", "NTA. And your honesty has probably made your life better in the long run.", "NTA but your family is FILLED with AH. \n\nA service dog is not the same as an emotional support dog. You have a medical need for the dog. The dog goes where you go. \n\nIf the private space you intend to go to cannot accommodate a dog (like someone in the house has a horrible allergy) then either the venue is moved or you bow out of that one event. \n\nBut it is wholly unreasonable for anyone to expect you could go anywhere without your service animal. \n\nThey are ostracizing you for not attending when you were forbidden from taking your medically necessary service animal?!? Good lord. They are awful people. \n\nWhere are your parents? This is insanity.", "Info: trained service dogs are amazing and cause no work for other people. Why would yours constitute a drain or distraction for anyone else? Do you have a trained service dog?", "NTA.  My son had a medical condition that was hopefully permanently alleviated by surgery.  Otherwise he would have the same symptoms before losing consciousness.   I get how much you depend on your service animal.    Sounds like your aunt wasn\u2019t stressed out because of the death, but because of her prejudices.  \n\nSadly she is not worth thinking about.  Take care of yourself and surround yourself with people who love you and care about you. Your aunt clearly does not", "NTA Would they ask someone to attend without their oxygen? Without their wheel chair? No?

Except emotional support service dogs we have in hospitals to warm exhausted patients.", "[removed]", "Without your service dog, you could pass out and end up in the ER.

I'm sorry about your uncle.", "INFO:  why doesn't your aunt \"have the emotional bandwidth\" to deal with your dog?\n\nI'm probably going to sound like an asshole here, but whatever.  I used to work in hospitality.  For the better part of a decade, our property was pet-free.  There were probably 20-25 \"service dogs\" that came through in my time there, and not a single one of them was legit.\n\nHow do I know?  Without exception, every guest/dog did a combination of the following:  \n\nPeople would start screeching about HIPAA if we asked the \"two questions\" - if the dog was a service dog required for a disability and what tasks the dogs were trained to perform.  The dogs would urinate and defecate in the rooms and common areas.  The dogs would growl and bark at other guests.\n\n\n*Edited for grammar", "Your aunt is an ignorant AH. You are not. You and the dog are a package deal. She needs to either see that or you can continue not attending. Why would your friends perform the job of the dog? That makes no sense.
