We share custody of our seven-year-old daughter, Lily, and have managed to maintain a relatively civil co-parenting relationship. However, things recently took a turn for the worse.\r  \n\r  \nLast week, Lily turned eight, and I decided to throw her a birthday party at our home. I planned the event meticulously, inviting Lily's friends, our family members, and a few close neighbors. I wanted it to be a special day for her. However, when I sent out the invitation to my ex-husband, I specifically mentioned that he would not be able to bring his girlfriend.\r  \n\r  \nNow, my reasoning behind this decision is that my ex-husband has been dating someone new for the past six months, and Lily hasn't had much interaction with her. I didn't think it was appropriate to have a stranger present at her birthday party, especially since my ex-husband and I agreed to introduce new partners to Lily gradually.\r  \n\r  \nMy ex-husband, upon receiving the invitation, immediately called me, furious and demanding an explanation. He accused me of trying to exclude him from Lily's life and claimed that he had every right to be there for her special day. He argued that his girlfriend had already met Lily on a few occasions and saw no issue with her attending the party.\r  \n\r  \nNaturally, this turned into a heated argument, with both of us standing our ground. I firmly stated that I didn't think it was fair to Lily to have a stranger present, regardless of a few brief meetings. My ex-husband insisted that he had just as much right to be there as I did and accused me of being spiteful and controlling.\r  \n\r  \nThe argument escalated, and we ended up involving our respective families, who took sides and added fuel to the fire. Some of my family members supported my decision, claiming that Lily's birthday should be about her and her closest loved ones. However, my ex-husband's family argued that he should be allowed to attend and that his girlfriend was an important part of his life, therefore she should be included.\r  \n\r  \nWe couldn't reach a compromise, and in the end, my ex-husband threatened legal action if I didn't allow him to attend the party. This left me feeling torn between wanting to make Lily happy and not wanting to escalate the situation further.\r  \n\r  \nAITA for excluding my ex-husband from our daughter's birthday party?\n\nEDIT: to answer a few questions, Lily has no opinion, her only concern is having all of her friends there and making sure the flavour of her cake is up to her standards. As her father and I have 50/50 custody and the birthday party is during my time, I feel like I have a large say in this. Additionally, she has met the girlfriend twice, they haven\u2019t exchanged more than a few hellos and she would not be comfortable alone with her, therefore, I do not feel that it\u2019s appropriate to invite her.

If his girlfriend wasn't invited to a party he didn't plan that only close people were invited to then he should've just gotten over it.

Which is it?", "Depending on how OP phrases it, Lily may not be able to answer honestly.\n\nAlso, it would be kinda unfair to put the decision on a kid. \n\nThere are 2 adults who should be able to cooperate for a kid\u2019s birthday party.", "Why would she involve a minor in this issue? OP is under no obligation to have her ex's SO of only 6 months in her home. The last thing she should do is being a child into this mess.", "What is the problem with her not wanting her there? She is not her child\u2019s friend and her child isn\u2019t asking for her attendance. Why does she need to have this woman at her home, at a party she is throwing for her child? I think dad and girlfriend can have their own celebration for the daughter on their time as well. Everyone wins. If dad and girlfriend get married then it would be in everyone\u2019s best interest to be cooperative and figure out how to integrate. It doesn\u2019t seem that they\u2019re there yet.", "Good point. A 7-year-old is barely going to notice. And after six months, she should know the woman by now better than she apparently does.\n+1 for YTA", "Personally if the ex and girlfriend have been dating only 6 months I\u2019d be concerned as well.  I don\u2019t get these people introducing a new partner after only dating for 6 months.  At this point you are still getting to know the other, is the relationship even going to last, why introduce your young daughter to someone you\u2019ve only been dating 6 months???", "They have only met briefly over a large extended family meal. I feel that a birthday party is a much more personal gathering and I'm just not certain that they are well acquainted enough to be such a large part of each others lives yet.", "Sounds like she\u2019s jealous that he\u2019s moved on.", "He\u2019s free to throw her a birthday party as well.  OP was nice enough to invite him as she absolutely did not have to and no court in the world would demand she invite him or his gf.", "He doesn't have to introduce them, it says the daughter has already met the GF several times.\n\nOP is the AH for her lame excuses. She just doesn't want the girlfriend there. The child may not have spent a LOT of time with the GF, but she does already know her and it sounds like the father has been introducing them slowly as asked. But that's his partner now, and given that the child already knows her, there's no reason to exclude her as a \"stranger\".", "No way. A 7/8 year old probably doesn't have a genuine opinion about this (unless the gf is either an amazing fairy godmother or an evil witch) and is definitely going to be manipulated by whatever parent is asking her, and then she'll be made to feel guilty by the other parent.", "She is 8, she is perfectly capable of answering the question of is she okay with her Dad bringing his friend or do you just want Dad to come by himself? It gives her autonomy to phrase it as \"Do you want to invite Dad and (GF), or do you want to invite just your Dad.\" She understands the concept of an invite and it's not putting her in the middle. If you don't trust OP to phrase it in a way that keeps her out of the middle, then it's just proof OP is TA here. If the Dad wouldn't be understanding his daughter only wants him at this particular BDay Party, then he is TA. Simples.\n\nI think OP is simply being petty in this situation, but she can at least ask her kid, 8 year olds aren't morons they can answer basic questions like that honestly. If she says the latter, okay power to her, I just doubt she ever would because kids don't care about this stuff.", "I think you just don\u2019t like the woman", "I do not see a difference, large extended family meal, birthday party with family and other friends. Sounds like a family meal is just as personal if not more so since it is only family.", "Have you considered that this may be a perfect way to help Lily and the girlfriend be more at ease with each other? Surrounded by friends and family?  You sound like you just don\u2019t want this woman in her life, and that sentiment will totally tank your relationship with your ex and have a very negative effect on Lily. Have you asked your child about her or even what she wants?  \n\nThere is no point in delaying the inevitable.  You need to learn to be on the same team as this woman if you want the best for your child. Get to know her. Make sure she understands how important your daughter is to you and what she needs from the adults in her life. I promise you that trying to carve her out is a dead end.", "An 8 yr old doesn\u2019t care what adults are at her party beyond her parents.  You are letting petty jealousy ruin her party.  \n\nWhat are you going to do next year when it\u2019s his turn and he retaliates by excluding you.\n\nThe two of you need to grow up and act like adults before it really hurts your daughter.", "The more you comment, the more of an asshole you sound like. My mother was a lot like you. I don't speak to her now. \n\nYou come off so bitter, controlling, and angry. You are NOT putting your daughter first. That's just some dumb facade you're putting on to make it seem like your intentions are noble. They're not.", "And next year he\u2019ll just do the same thing to her when it\u2019s his turn to have her in her birthday.", "Yeah you\u2019re right I misread. It does sound like OP just doesn\u2019t want her there", "\ud83d\udcafDo not put a child in the middle of this. It is incredibly unfair to her. And do not let her dictate who her parents can date. That is unfair to the adults.\n\nSource: child of divorce whose parents made every damn event a fight.", "Lily might be perfectly able to answer the question but it might not be what\u2019s best for her. She\u2019s be put in the middle and may feel like she\u2019s disappointing either mom or dad no matter what her choice is.\n\n\nNTA. OP hosts and it\u2019s on her time with Lily. She doesn\u2019t have to invite the ex, he can host a party when it\u2019s his time with Lily. I imagine none of his family members will be joining OPs party, so he can throw a party and invite them."]}
