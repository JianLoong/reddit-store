{"id": 19295, "submission_id": "144cx6x", "title": "AITA for Not Allowing My Ex to Attend Our Child's Birthday Party?", "selftext": "I (34F) and my ex-husband (36M) divorced two years ago due to irreconcilable differences. We share custody of our seven-year-old daughter, Lily, and have managed to maintain a relatively civil co-parenting relationship. However, things recently took a turn for the worse.\n\nLast week, Lily turned eight, and I decided to throw her a birthday party at our home. I planned the event meticulously, inviting Lily's friends, our family members, and a few close neighbors. I wanted it to be a special day for her. However, when I sent out the invitation to my ex-husband, I specifically mentioned that he would not be able to bring his girlfriend.\n\nNow, my reasoning behind this decision is that my ex-husband has been dating someone new for the past six months, and Lily hasn't had much interaction with her. I didn't think it was appropriate to have a stranger present at her birthday party, especially since my ex-husband and I agreed to introduce new partners to Lily gradually.\n\nMy ex-husband, upon receiving the invitation, immediately called me, furious and demanding an explanation. He accused me of trying to exclude him from Lily's life and claimed that he had every right to be there for her special day. He argued that his girlfriend had already met Lily on a few occasions and saw no issue with her attending the party.\n\nNaturally, this turned into a heated argument, with both of us standing our ground. I firmly stated that I didn't think it was fair to Lily to have a stranger present, regardless of a few brief meetings. My ex-husband insisted that he had just as much right to be there as I did and accused me of being spiteful and controlling.\n\nThe argument escalated, and we ended up involving our respective families, who took sides and added fuel to the fire. Some of my family members supported my decision, claiming that Lily's birthday should be about her and her closest loved ones. However, my ex-husband's family argued that he should be allowed to attend and that his girlfriend was an important part of his life, therefore she should be included.\n\nWe couldn't reach a compromise, and in the end, my ex-husband threatened legal action if I didn't allow him to attend the party. This left me feeling torn between wanting to make Lily happy and not wanting to escalate the situation further.\n\nAITA for excluding my ex-husband from our daughter's birthday party?\n\nEDIT: to answer a few questions, Lily has no opinion, her only concern is having all of her friends there and making sure the flavour of her cake is up to her standards. As her father and I have 50/50 custody and the birthday party is during my time, I feel like I have a large say in this. Additionally, she has met the girlfriend twice, they haven\u2019t exchanged more than a few hellos and she would not be comfortable alone with her, therefore, I do not feel that it\u2019s appropriate to invite her. My ex husband is free to come, his girlfriend is not.", "created_utc": 1686239565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144cx6x/aita_for_not_allowing_my_ex_to_attend_our_childs/", "score": 4485, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If his girlfriend wasn't invited to a party he didn't plan that only close people were invited to then he should've just gotten over it.

She isn't going to be \"alone\" with the woman at the party, and this is in fact an opportunity for her, AND you, to be more comfortable with a person your ex has been dating for six months and who will likely be around the whole time. It sounds to me like YOU don't want the girlfriend around YOU- or else you'd have had a problem the first two times Lily met her with dad. You're an AH because you're demonstrating to your child that you don't like girlfriend, which she inevitably will imitate, and it WILL drive a wedge between her and her father. \n\nDad is an AH because he's ALSO using his daughter as a pawn in whatever weird little game you two are playing. He knows well that he could go without the girlfriend. But instead he's trying to say you won't let him come at all. \n\nIf you want to play the \"my time, my rules\" game I can tell you it will not end well. I grew up in an environment like that. I could never have a big party with my WHOLE family there, I had to have 2-3 separate ones. It seems like a dream for a kid, and it was, until I turned about 10. Then it started to feel like a chore. And now, it's terrible. I can't have family Christmas at my house with my one year old because his Grandparents will stand on opposite sides of the house and refuse to speak to each other- instead I have to drag the whole family out ALL Christmas Eve to one house, then the other, while being guilt tripped by both sides about not spending enough time with either one. For my son's first birthday party I had to run between two rooms to talk to either side- and both were mad they didn't spend more time with me or him. It's exhausting and it sucks- and they've been divorced for over 20 years. But they never learned to tolerate each other for more than a while when I was a kid, so why would they now?\n\nJust suck it up for your kid. Use this party as a way to see how the girlfriend fits into your daughter's and your own life- because 6 months is a serious relationship. I'm curious as to when you'd consider it okay for the girl to be around- 1 year? 5? 10?- before she could be invited to the same parties as your ex.  Set the standard and hold her father to it in the event he tries to plan a party later in your kids life and tries to exclude you or your partner. \n\nOh, neither of you should assume your kid is being honest about not caring if the girlfriend is there or not. I lied through my teeth to both my parents about liking or not liking the other's partner to keep them from fighting and to make whoever I was talking to happy. If Lily senses you don't want the girlfriend there, then even if she adores her she won't tell you that. And if she doesn't like her but wants to please Dad, she'll tell him the girl is great. You both need to reassure her that no matter how she feels about the girlfriend, it's okay to tell you and that you won't be sad or upset about it. And then you need to communicate with her Dad about what she's telling each of you- if there are discrepencies, she's hiding how she feels and you'd all probably benefit from family counseling or individual to make sure she has a safe space to express her true feelings on matters.", "ESH. This should have been a conversation. Talk to Lily. \"Have you met X? Would you like her to come to your party?\" If the answers were yes and yes or yes and I don't care there's no reason to exclude her.

I talked to a lawyer, who said (and I quote) \"Unless you have something in your custody agreement about joint birthday parties, you have no grounds to do anything. Being an asshole is not illegal.\"", "honestly, YTA. \n\nBe honest, the reason you dont want girlfriend around is because YOU dont like the fact that he\u2019s dating. Lily isn\u2019t gonna give two shits if she\u2019s there. You\u2019re being petty and starting drama because of YOUR issues with your EX-HUSBAND. Almost like the party isn\u2019t really about lily. Just get over it and let him bring his girlfriend.", "ESH\n\nHe didn't have to threaten Court action and throw a fit. I have a very contentious relationship with my children's father, and his need to control my every move even now, after 7 years divorced, is maddening. He tried to tell me I couldn't introduce my now husband to the kids until we were engaged. I laughed that one off. Plus, it's your house and technically you can invite whoever you want.\n\nHowever, YTA as well. They've been dating for six months. Also, gotta love the people on here questioning introducing \"so soon\". After 6 months, you want to spend more time with the person and share more of your life with that person. That includes family and children. Unless it's specifically written in the parenting plan, you ultimately have no control over when or where Lily meets GF. Hell, Lily has already met her! Lily will probably see GF with Dad and think \"Oh cool. GF is here too\" and go about her merry way. Specifically saying \"no SHE can't come!\" is petty as hell on your part. What if he wasn't thinking of inviting her at that point? You barring her makes him want her there even more. \n\nIt's an 8 year old's birthday party. Let it go.", "YTA, you are still trying to control your ex by using your kid as a weapon.", "YTA this is about your child not you. If her father does not attend she will be hurt.", "This could have been your opportunity to get to know the girlfriend and to begin to build an alliance, if not a friendship. Instead, you\u2019ve decided to be antagonistic and draw a line in the sand, starting a battle that could go on for years. Which behavior do you think would be better for your child? Do you think she will enjoy walking a tightrope between sides for the foreseeable future? YTA.", "ESH. You two fought enough over a birthday party that you dragged your families into it, and legal action was threatened? You both best learn to work things out quickly, or your daughter is going to resent both of you.", "NTA because it\u2019s your house I guess but if you don\u2019t want the girlfriend there, just say so. \n\nYTA because you\u2019re pretending this is about Lily, who clearly doesn\u2019t give a shit either way. Don\u2019t bring her into your drama. \nWhen I was a kid and had birthday parties, my friends\u2019 parents would come as well. I wouldn\u2019t expect my parents to supervise that many children on their own. There ended up being a bunch of adults I\u2019d never met at my birthday parties. That\u2019s just how it goes. There\u2019s nothing uncomfortable about it. The kids are just going to be doing their own thing.", "ESH. It does not sound like this woman was the reason for your divorce and an eight year old birthday party she\u2019s not going to be left on with this woman she would barely interact with her. It\u2019s like you went out of your way to be petty.\n\nAs for the ask, if he\u2019s so upset, have his own party, but threatening legal action is ludicrous   \n\nMaybe you should make an effort to get to know the girlfriend in the interest of peace in your child\u2019s life", "YTA. \n\nUgh! I hate divorced parents that don't understand that this isn't about you. When it comes to your child your both suck it up and deal. Your child has done NOTHING wrong! Why is it so hard to understand that the more people that your kids have in their lives, the more people there is to give them and show them love! \n\nI understand that she hasn't met her much, or that you haven't met her enough. Or whatever you tell yourself is the reason. But why in the world would you turn down meeting this woman \"on your turf\"? At least then it's in an environment you can control. But no, you want to be petty... Cool.... \n\nAlso, by inviting her you will also help your child, she needs to interact with this woman going forward. If she sees her mom being the better person, it might make it a bit easier on her. Kids are extremely loyal to their parents, to the extent that it can hurt themselves. Do you want her to feel guilty because she thinks you don't want her to meet daddys girlfriend and at the same time feeling guilty towards him for not wanting to meet his gf. You are (both) setting your child up to fail. Please don't! \nGet over yourselves! \n\nHere you have the perfect opportunity to be the bigger person. You're choosing not to be.", "YTA\n\nYou're creating conflict for the sake of it. What purpose does this serve? The child and gf have met already. You are pulling a power play. And as you say, it's 50/50 between you and him. I expect this to happen to you too, it might be even petter and just not have you invited to his home for an event. Unstick your head from your ass and co parent correctly", "YTA, clearly resenting your husband and his SO, and you are using your child's party as a weapon to inflict a petty wound to your husband.  \n\nDo you think this lady is going to abuse your child at her birthday party?

FYI the girlfriend is not a stranger, quit acting like she is some random person he picked on the side of the road on his way to the party. And you only want her \"closest loved ones\" at her party, but you invited neighbors. You alone decided that the gf wasn't enough of a loved one to be included, even tho they've been together six months. \n\nHe is an AH for choosing said gf over attending his child's birthday party. He chose a really bad hill to die on. \n\nWe only get one side of the story here and I have a feeling this is about way more than gf not being one of the chosen \"closest loved ones\". BTW kids could give 2 Fs who are at their party, they just want to play, eat cake, and open gifts.  You both suck.", "ESH: I get what you are trying to do and I agree, bringing the gf would be a bad idea.

You said she\u2019s already net her multiple times and doesn\u2019t mind if she comes.", "ESH\n\nYour daughter had met the new girlfriend several times already. It comes off as a power play to exclude her and use your daughter as an excuse when she doesn\u2019t appear to care.\n\nOn the other hand it is your home and you should have the right to determine who attends. However I guess choosing such a venue to then have the excuse of excluding your exs partner is also shady.\n\nI think you\u2019ve dug yourself a hole here and can probably expect shenanigans in turn from your ex when her birthday falls on his time next.", "ESH\n\nI don't want to pile on, I generally agree with what most are saying here. \n\nShe's met the gf on several occasions, she is in fact NOT a stranger. Claiming that you don't want her there because she and Lily aren't that close is odd, it's not like she's going over to babysit, she's attending a party with a lot of other people. You sound bitter, and if you aren't that's how it comes across. \n\nHe can't demand you let someone in your home, and he has the option to go without his gf.

If it\u2019s the latter, then why do you care if the gf attends? Seems like if you\u2019re focusing on the party then you don\u2019t want her there for your OWN reasons, not because of anything to do with Lily.\n\nYour ex sucks because threatening legal action over not being invited to a birthday party is frankly a ridiculous overreaction.

The new gf will be meeting a lot of his family for the first time too. A lot of exes do not want to pay for that meeting, and that\u2019s ok. A lot of women (like the new gf) would understand this too. This guy is causing an issue and taking a stand for his gf just for his gf probably to be ok with not coming anyway.

I'm going to go with NAH here because I completely understand where both of y'all are coming from.

My younger daughter was too young for me to take, but I got her a t-shirt, it wasn\u2019t even her favourite colour, but she was obsessed by her \u2018lympics t-shirt and would always ask to wear it.

When I was 8, I noticed when my dad spent time with his girlfriend. I thought my dad was cheating, but he says he and my mom were separated. I always noticed when there was clearly someone who didn't belong (my dad's girlfriend) and didn't want her there... but people assumed we as kids wouldn't notice and we didn't get a say. I conversed with my siblings on a weekly, (sometimes daily) basis regarding what my dad was doing.\n\n2. My kid noticed when she was 6 that she was constantly around girls her dad said was his friend. She states, \"They were sleeping in the same bed together; they weren't friends.\" She tells me her dad would use these women to take care of her so he wouldn't have to. He would be with these girls for years as \"friends\" and then they would be replaced by someone else, and she would have to put her trust into a whole new person that is given the task of taking care of her.\n\n\nThis is not to say this is the same situation.

Otherwise, these relationships affect them a lot more than it should.\n\n\nOP, NTA unless he has announced that he plans to marry this person or intends to have some sort of long-term relationship with her. The agreement was in place to prevent the \"loss\" of a caretaker should they decide to break up. Also, it's your time. Unless it explicitly states how to handle interactions with 3rd parties, I'm assuming only you are the one to decide who can be around your kid during your time. Next time, during his time, he can make those kind of decisions.\n\nLastly. The people are stating you're making it about you. It is about you.

He probably shouldn\u2019t demand that she come, but the question is not about if he was an asshole for demanding that she come, it was if you were the asshole for refusing to let her come. In ten years your daughter probably won\u2019t remember if she was there or not (unless you do something obnoxious to single her out or make it obvious that you don\u2019t want her there, which would also make you the AH) because there are going to be so many distractions, BUT she will remember that her dad wasn\u2019t there and that you were the reason. His GF is eventually going to develop a relationship with your daughter, be the grown up, welcome her to the party and allow your daughter to make her own decisions about her feelings towards this woman as she gets to know her. You don\u2019t want to put your daughter in the middle, which is exactly what you are doing. She won\u2019t be alone with her, so who cares if she is uncomfortable being alone with her?", "Exactly my thoughts. OP you either blend families and make your daughter happier or start separate events.", "Totally agree.  ESH.  \n\n\nI mean, what if a not-so-well-known relative of hers came into town and wanted to be invited?   Is she going to exclude and vet everyone that Lily doesn't \"know well enough (whatever that means)?\"    \n\n\nKids don't really care to the extent the OP is making it out to be.  It sounds a lot more as if she's the one with the problem with the new gf.", "Exactly my thoughts but much better and more concisely put.", "I don\u2019t think OP should have to welcome his ex\u2019s new girlfriend into her home if she isn\u2019t comfortable with it. Especially at this stage. They\u2019ve only been together six months, and this is a party is throwing with no mention of help from the ex. So as far as I\u2019m concerned, OP doesn\u2019t have to invite her- or even him. He could have a event for his child too.\n\nEdit: just to add, I only say she doesn\u2019t have to invite him because, really if she wasn\u2019t comfortable with him in her home that would be valid. There\u2019s custody arrangements for a reason. I think it\u2019s great they have (or had) a good co parent relationship though and are comfortable inviting each other to private home events. I most especially say that as it sounds like he didn\u2019t contribute to the party. It sounds like the child is indifferent to the new partner either way, so this early on OP doesn\u2019t have to invite her to OP\u2019s home if she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable. I\u2019d maybe say otherwise if the relationship was more long term.", "This is exactly how it should be! My ex husband cheated on me and put me through hell and I STILL wouldn\u2019t exclude him from anything. Girlfriend or not, that\u2019s none of my business honestly. All I care about is that he\u2019s present for his children, and he always has been.", "In general you are right but OP is the one who doesn\u2019t want gf at the party and she is using her child as an excuse. If she really thought it wouldn\u2019t be fair to daughter, wouldn\u2019t it also be not fair to not ask the daughters opinion?\n\nOP sent the solo invitation knowing it would be a problem when the focus should be on daughter. As a former 8 year old myself I really don\u2019t think daughter would care either way.", "And what exactly was the message dad got, and how?  OP implies it was on the standard invite and if thTs the case it couldn't have been polite.", ">Why can\u2019t he have a party at his home during his parenting time?\n\nThat seems incredibly unhealthy for the kid, but then again there is no perfect solution for those with divorced parents.", "Plus OP says in her edit that all Lily cares about is having her friends there and the cake.  Which makes sense.  The adults at a kid's birthday party mostly just hang out with each other and keep an eye on the kids so they don't get hurt or get into fights.  This is 100% about OP having issues with her ex having found someone new.", "Alternatively, I met my now 12 yo SS when he was six after dating my partner for about 6 months, and by the end of that meeting he was hugging me and giving me his favorite stuffed animal to hold. Third hang out, crying when it was time to go, he didn't want to leave me. If daughter is truly ambivalent about GF, then it doesnt seem like her comfort would be an issue unless mom makes it one. Kids are guileless, parents are the ones who need to manage their feelings. She's giving HCBM vibes, and fighting to include his GF could be an indication that their relationship is actually very serious and he wants her to be part of his daughter's life. OP obviously has every right to invite or not invite people into her house. That doesn't mean she's not the A H here.\n\nPoint being, every blended family situation is different, and bringing it to internet strangers instead of working it out with a therapist or with each other makes ESH the best answer.", "I imagine next year he will throw the party and mom won't be invited or he'll make the terms difficult enough for her to come that she won't be able to\n\nWhen people make these decisions they need to consider what it would be like on the other side, because next year they will be on the other side", "They will have to if mum is going to be this petty.", "And Dad is insisting even tho it's become an issue. It's all push and pull between the parents, kid doesn't fn care. ESH indeed. Poor kid, it's gonna be rough growing up if the parents don't actually commit to what's best for the child.", "I don't think this Is the best family event to bring his gf to. His daughter's birthday should at her mother's house. After only having seen the daughter twice in passing.", "Ha! No, I just got tired of all the replies acting like I was giving OP's ex a pass in this.", "Having met the daughter twice very briefly and having dated the dad for only six months means it's probably too soon! Especially if the dad and gf haven't been in any family events with the daughter yet. It doesn't make sense to start with her birthday at her mother's house.", "Because it\u2019s not that big of a deal and starting this huge fight seems petty. Why does it bother her so much that the gf is there? Not because of the daughter obviously, they\u2019ve already met and it\u2019s fine. OP is the one uncomfortable being around the gf and I 100% get it and feel for her, that\u2019s so awkward sometimes. But hopefully both of these adult people will move on and date and start new lives with new people and she will want her ex to welcome her new beau and keep things civil one day. This didn\u2019t need to be a deal. Could have just said hey welcome to my home and avoided them.", "It's fine if she admits that she's the one that doesn't want the GF there. The problem is her either not being honest with herself, or blatantly saying it's for the daughters best interest when she just doesn't want to tell the truth.", "It's way over-the-top and controlling. Unless she has a personal problem with this new woman (in which case, she needs to own it), she's doing this for personal reasons and hiding behind her daughter. It's gross.", "How well does she know the kids parents who will also be at her house?", "Maybe he doesn't want to create an expectation that his ex gets to decide what events his partner can and can't come to.", ">where did she say he can\u2019t come to the party? \n\n\"AITA for Not Allowing My Ex to Attend Our Child's Birthday Party?\"", "That\u2019s what I thought. If I were the ex, I\u2019d leave the gf at home. It became an issue when OP specifically banned the new gf.", "I hate parents who use their kids as an excuse for being petty post divorce. Either one of them could have said \"it's fine\" and moved on. Instead they've involved their families in this. \n\nThe daughter isn't a toy. They need to be better.", "That's a fine reason to keep the partner from meeting the child until you feel like the relationship has a certain degree of stability.\n\nApperently dad has already reached that point given that they've been introduced. If he got that wrong, that's on him, but that genie is already out of bottle. Mom doesn't get to shove it back in.", "Hell, half the parents of other kids are probably just as much \"strangers\" as the girlfriend.", "Agreed. \n\nSome \"close neighbours\" are invited! Do those all meet this criterion of getting along one-on-one with the 8 yo?\n\nMy 9 yo niece is very shy. \nWhenever my brother asks me to babysit, we have to plan at least 2 hours as a grace period for \"the handover\" : even though she knows me and has even slept over at my place on her own, she just can't handle a brusque transition.\n\nSo, is a kid's comfort level really the best indicator, knowing she'll be safe and sound in her own home with her parents and friends celebrating with her?", "Agreed.\n\nfeel like the mom is being a petty gatekeeper on this. **THEY ALREADY MET!!** He has as a say 50% of the time on who the kid sees. She is never going to block the gf from being involved.   She needs to either invite him with his +1 and stfu or make him have his own party (and know she is being petty af).  This drama is her doing alone!  \n\n She is still pissed that they spilt (which I fully understand).  She is clearly trying to get back at the ex-husband..  I am wondering if her ex cheated, which would at least explain why she is freaking so hard on this.", "Spite", "This man threatened legal action, he'd rather get a lawyer to bust up his exes party than organise his own", "And that's why ESH. Either one of them could have acted like an adult and solved the problem, AND not involved the whole extended family. I do feel sorry for the child.", "Why would her being a wife make it different?", "Yeah, instead of admitting, \"I don't want my ex's new woman in my house,\" she's making it about the kid and putting that on her. \"ShE wOn'T bE cOmFoRtAbLe.\" But simultaneously has no opinion. Pick one, OP. \n\nIf OP was honest, I'd say not TA. \n\nThe kid isn't gonna care about one more adult (that she's already met) being there. She's gonna be focused on her friends and presents.", "Lily won\u2019t even notice the GF because she\u2019ll be too busy having fun with her friends.", "Oh no! I feel like there are definitely normal ways to handle it, but a lot of people would rather throw as many dolls into their playhouse to play house as they can instead of going to therapy and listening to their kids. I wouldn\u2019t put much stock in the extremes of Reddit.", "You must be young if you think dating someone for 6 months is long. No, not in the least.", "I hate both sides/gender reverse, but seeing a comment saying that it's different if it's the parent that has the kid most of the time, I absolutely agree with you.", "Agree, but I come down on the side of YTA as mum shouldn't be using daughters birthday party as a forum for exercising her control and/or disapproval of her exs new partner.", "BINGO!", "She trusted him enough to pick her as the mother of his child but now doesn't trust decision-making skills. Makes sense.\n\nShe also said they have been co-parenting well but maybe not so well because the issue  seem to be that she didn't get introduced to the girlfriend before her child. And maybe dad didn't do that because he could anticipate the reaction. \n\nBut maybe gf is a really nice person and her child will grow to love her... but then maybe that's the problem.", "Because it\u2019s not really about a stranger being there, so much as it is a new gf. If it was the ex husband\u2019s sister who was in from out of town who had never met her niece, would she still have a problem with it? \nOp is def the asshole, because she\u2019s weaponizing her daughters birthday. Would she be ok if the birthday had landed on her ex\u2019s time and he excluded her future bf or anyone from her side? \nOp\u2019s ex is also the asshole, because he could just go to the party and then take the daughter out to dinner with the new gf.", "The kid is 8, and OP invited her kid's friends. There are bound to be some strangers there as some parents stick around. So, in order for this to only be about not wanting strangers in the house,  I have to assume she told the parents of the kids she is not familiar with that they can't come in. \n\nI can pretty much bet, She is not doing that, so it reverts right back to her having an issue with the new girlfriend.", "I think this and she's embarrassed that she's still alone while he has someone to bring along who Lily doesn't dislike or have any fear about.

I\u2019m surprised at all the ESH I\u2019m seeing, but I\u2019m just going to share my personal opinion. If I were in OP\u2019s shoes, and I was throwing a birthday party for my child in MY home, I wouldn\u2019t want my ex\u2019s new girlfriend present either. Not only has the child barely gotten past learning this woman\u2019s first name, trying to integrate her this way puts her in OP\u2019s family environment and OP\u2019s house. Call it immature if you\u2019d like, but being that the girlfriend has no semblance of a relationship with the child other than being dad\u2019s new girlfriend, there\u2019s honestly no reason for her to be there. Children have no place knowing the whereabouts of your dating life if your partner isn\u2019t ready to be involved as a parental figure. If the father wants to bring gf around more that\u2019s fine, but if he hasn\u2019t than throwing her in just makes no sense. No one said the father couldn\u2019t come, he just doesn\u2019t want to come without his girlfriend. That\u2019s on him, not OP. Maybe the child might not have a clear and opinion, but at the end of the day she\u2019s a child, so it falls on her mother to make decisions for her. And if her mother doesn\u2019t want a stranger around her daughter ( with due reason ), then OP has every right to say she can\u2019t come. It\u2019s during her custody time, her house, and with her family. It\u2019s simply a boundary, and an ex bringing their new partner when OP is not okay with it, civil relationship or not, is crossing that boundary.", "NTA for not wanting a strange woman in your home at your child's party, but you suck for everything else. You need to learn to, control yourself? i guess? when it comes to arguing with your ex.", "Why doesn\u2019t he just have his own party for yall daughter at his house that way the girlfriend can be there. I\u2019m saying nta because it is your house and you have a right to invite whoever you want in your house that you paid for. Best of luck.", "NTA  If the party is during your possession time, you ex is lucky you are even inviting him, as he has no legal right to be there.   There courts feel he can pick a day during his possession time to throw his own party for her if he wants to celebrate with her.  Six months is about the minimum time he should be dating someone to even be introducing her to his daughter.  I laugh if he thinks the court is going to insist he be allowed to bring one of his girlfriends around during Your possession time.", "Nta. You gave him the option to come to your party alone, you didn't have to invite him at all. If it's truly about his daughter, the girlfriend doesn't need to be there. What is he going to tell the court? I was invited but she wouldn't let me bring my girlfriend to a party she was throwing during her parenting time.  Good luck with that one. He also has the option to have his own party.", "Do not agree. There is no reason that is in the child\u2019s best interest for the girlfriend to come.", "\"If you do not allow my girlfriend to attend an 8 year olds birthday party I will lawyer up\" is a new one", "Girlfriend also sucks. Unless she enjoys being the center of the drama and watching things blow up, she should just graciously decline to attend. Life is too short to fight over unnecessary things \"on principle.\"", "Also, OP says they invited neighbors and Lily\u2019s friends. At 8, parents usually attend the birthday parties along with their kids. Are we to believe Lily has close relationships with all of her friends parents and the dad\u2019s girlfriend is the only person in attendance that Lily doesn\u2019t have a close relationship with?", "Boom. Nailed it.", "Child of divorced parents who did this shit alllll their days and damaged each of us by their inability to be decent human beings to the human beings they created. \n\nYTA and so is your ex. Get your shit together before you deeply and permanently damage this child.", "Agree bigtime with this.\n\nThe question is, would the kid want her dad to be there with his new woman or not want her dad there at all?\n\nIt\u2019s a hard one but I don\u2019t think either parent is acting in the best interest of their daughter and both are making it about themselves.", "What does your custody agreement say about birthdays?

If it's his turn to have her on her birthday, then he would get her even if it's \"your time.\"\n\nHowever, that said, if you're in agreement for him to be there, then he has the right to have his girlfriend there. It sounds like you're the one with the problem, not your daughter. I would hope that you're ex would be agreeable and meet up with the girlfriend later, rather than cause dissension at the party.", "I completely agree. \nNTA\n\nAnd the ex's threats take his ahlery to a new level. \n\n- having met the daughter twice in passing is not enough to warrant an invitation\n\n- I assume since the above point stands they have not had a family event with both the gf and daughter and this is not the one to do it\n\n- what ex wants to do is not gradual introduction of a new partner, which is what they agreed to\n\n- OP is throwing the party and is allowed to set the rules \n\n- ex unnecessarily escalated the situation and I get the impression he has alterior motives. Why else would he insist on this event and not organise something where both his gf and his family (+daughter) are there if he is in a rush to get serious with her - eg. Sunday lunch for the family \n\n- all the people calling op jealous and an ah are blinded by their own biases. OP is allowed to set boundaries and nothing she is doing is harming the child or the child's relationship with the father or any future relationship with the father's gf.

Just have separate celebrations.", "Just shows who is more important to dad and it clearly isn't the child.", "But as a person who split 50/50 custody wouldn't you want to get to know the person who is going to be around your child 50% of the time potentially? This just seems like a good test for the girlfriend, and the best part is the OP didn't initiate this test so if it all goes horribly wrong it's not her fault", "That's easy to say, but you don't know that at all. And I mean this for everyone saying OP is T A, not just you.   If they've only been dating for 6 month, and the daughter had only met the GF twice, it is a completely reasonable request.  Not to mention OP says they agreed to introduce new partners slowly.  Meeting new partners can be really hard on young kids.  \n\nMy divorce decree states we aren't allowed to introduce our daughter to new partners for 9 months, and this was suggested by our lawyers, in the best interest of our child, and was part of a standard document.  So yea, OP having concerns about her being at an 8th birthday is completely valid. \n\nEven if you don't think so, if Dad misses his daughter's 8th birthday party because he can't bring a woman he he's been dating for 6 months, that shoud tell you everything you need to know about the type of \"father\" he is.  My guess is there's a lot more that OP deals with that we aren't hearing.  If OP was truly just being a petty A H and dad was a decent guy, he'd still show up for his kid, and fight with OP about it later.  \n\nOP, NTA here.", "IKR? And if I were the gf, I'd be like whoohoo! I'll go get a mani-pedi (or whatever) instead of going to a kids birthday party!

She's not excluding the dad. I don't see what the problem is. If it's about the child, then Dad needs to drop his stance too.", "I absolutely would have noticed at 8 in these circumstances if my dad had chosen to bring his girlfriend to my party. This would not be an adult everybody there already knew. She would have to be introduced repeatedly to the others there. The energy at the event would be different. \n\nMy parents divorced when I was 6. My dad ended up married 3 times. Children are not the happy little creatures living in bubbles unaware of the undercurrents being played out by the adults who make all the decisions affecting their lives. \n\nMom here is both being reasonable by inviting dad, and within her rights and has valid cause for saying no to girlfriend.

It's ridiculous. The kid just starts enjoying playing with their new stuff and has to be carted an hour away with the other parent whilst not being able to take their new stuff. The parents split even parties exactly equal so one in one out  Sometimes custody agreements can just be about the parents and much less about best for the child.

She could be gone any minute.  OP has every right to contain her young daughter's festivities to their close, inner circle, especially in her own home.

Nor is the agreement to introduce new partners gradually a reason, since the gf being there *would* be a gradual introduction since they've met a few times before, and Lily is going to be playing with her friends. Had OP had the decency to talk to her ex about this rather than just tell him in an invitation, maybe she could have said \"look, here's how I feel. Would you be ok with not bringing your girlfriend?\" or maybe compromising and asking if it would be ok if she only came for a little bit so it isn't too much for Lily, but of course he was more than welcome to stay for the whole party.", "this is what happens when you try the fake politeness approach.
