So, three families have to travel to OP, but SHE won't travel to where her kids live? WHAT? OP, you SHOULD be going to them for Christmas.", "This Yta, also if my parents or in-laws moved away, I would not be hauling my kids out of state for Christmas every other year. They could come to us or I\u2019d visit another time of the year. OP you made a choice to move away, your son is making a choice to stay home for the holidays.", "Yeah YTA. Why can\u2019t you visit them? You\u2019re the one who moved. Three families are supposed to travel to you at your whim and demand?", "It\u2019s hard for my husband to travel", "OP , this is not a good idea . She's already been told no . So your advice is to go around her son , who has already told her no , and try to get a different decision from his wife by attempting to emotionally blackmail her ? \n\nThey , as I am sure he had discussed this decision with his wife have already given a clear no . If she wants to see her grandchild , other suggestions like making a second Christmas , or her coming to them , but its a big mistake  to hear no from once spouse and try to go to the other one . She is already being ignored by him for snapping and insisting that he does what she says and refuses to take no for an answer, trying to get in between then when her son has already clearly told her that he is not going to ask his wife to give up something that's important tos her is only going to result in that continuing", "We used to have Christmas in July with my family when all of the eldest generation was still alive. It was great, we'd even put up decorations, take pictures in a sleigh my aunt put up on her property on a huge white blanket. In the mean time all of the younger kids got to swim in the big pond and we could just all hang out and have fun without anybody feeling bad about needing to choose between families.", "[deleted]", "Exactly.  My mother in law moved out of state and we never saw her for Christmas again.  We love her and visit, but we are not compromising our immediate family traditions, vacation time, and peak time travel costs so she can see our kids on that specific day", "It's hard for an infant to travel, too.   If it's a big enough distance that your husband can't make the drive, it is also a big enough distance that it's hard to travel with an infant and, later, a toddler.  \n\nThis is a time for compromise.  Can you meet each other half-way, at a hotel, for Easter, after the baby's a year old?   Can you do Zoom calls?  Can your son and his wife travel to you for a different holiday?", "Seems like it's your problem, not your son's problem...", "Then why move? Why are you expecting all your children to travel to you, when it makes more sense for you to go to them. You\u2019re the one who moved out the way for everyone else, but yet your expecting them to accommodate you. Does that even make sense", "it\u2019s hard to travel when pregnant but u don\u2019t seem to be understanding of that", "Remember traveling with a newborn? Like that's not \"*hard*\".\n\nOr when the baby is older - your son is expected to truck the kid, gear AND presents to you? No opening gifts at home under their own tree (probably like your own son did when he was a boy?)\n\nYou won't go there or (God forbid) choose another holiday where they can visit and appear before Your Highness at Your Highness' convenience?", "Then why the eff did you move? Someone who can't travel well should try to live as close to people they want to see as possible, not move further away.", "Yta - Hypocrisy table for 1", "And you don't think its hard for them to pack up kids and use pto to come see you?", "Then why move away in the first place? You chose to leave. Don\u2019t expect others to bed over and throw a tantrum for your choices.", "Well, you chose to move away.\n\nThis is a natural consequence of that decision.\n\nYou can't expect everyone to jump to accommodate you when it's your choices that made getting together vastly more difficult for everyone involved.", "So you moved an entire state away?! You\u2019re a hypocrite and an AH! YTA OP", "It's hard to travel with an infant", "thanksgiving is literally the last word in the post?", "Not every county has states either but those two things overlap quite alot"]}
