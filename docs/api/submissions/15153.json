It's a time for fawning over the bride, repeatedly tell her how beautiful she is, and how dare do guests (who may have paid many $$ to get there) have a good time themselves and divert their attention from the star attraction? How dare they? IT'S ALL ABOUT US, *remember*?\n\nIt must be bleak for a bride to wake up the next day, after months of planning, feeling hungover and bloated from too much wine and cake, seething because one of the guests wore maroon and they insisted on burgundy.
