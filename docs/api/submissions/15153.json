Your SIL is way out of line. You are extending your stay and going to another island. You are spending a ton of money to go there and your wife is from the Philippines. SIL is out of her mind.

No. It\u2019s probably just rooted in logic, like being in mourning while you get married, will probably not make for a nice first year of marriage, or siblings may not want to share attention (see ex. above with FSIL lol).

Not a dry eye in the house. \n\nAt the reception Lisa and Stephanie both changed into gorgeous rainbowy dresses and Jane rocked a dark suit that had a lot of women rethinking their Kinsey scores\ud83e\udd74 Great food,  great music .... the venue required them to stop serving alcohol after a few hours but the party just kept going.", "I\u2019m older than you all. My birthday year comes first!", "Kudos to your brother\nHe's doing fine\nIt's better to ignore some answers cause some people on reddit live in a fake world where they suggest cutting off a relationship at even the slightest inconvenience. Everyone has bad qualities and good too. It is up to us how we handle both situations. \nRegarding your situation, seems your brother has it sorted out even if FSIL gets angry later on. Good luck with your proposal", "She sounds exhausting tbh", "Does she have borderline personality disorder?", "The SIL is probably super attractive.  When her looks fade, AND she is still an awful\nperson,  then what does he have.  She needs to get a life coach.   Figure her shit out.", "Leap Year baby coming in to say y'all better plan to take a year off every four years, because it'll finally be my turn...", "Why should *I* have to change my birthday year, when clearly, *you specifically chose* to be born on a leap year!", "Not sure about OPs situation, but I do not want my partner asking for my parents/grandparents permission. I don\u2019t need permission to marry someone. I hope this tradition dies. It\u2019s outdated and sexist.", "I have literally written that last sentence about my own SO many times. Same overall dynamic. She flies off the handle into rages or dramatic, performative sobbing fits. My dad doesn\u2019t handle it IDEALLY since at this point he starts snapping back but frankly if I was still living with her I would\u2019ve done a sprinkling of light homicide at this point. She\u2019s done it all, from locking herself in the bathroom for a tantrum to threatening to kill herself to slapping herself in the face as a fake \u201capology\u201d to try to force people to feel sorry for her. \n\nANYWAY that was mostly a \u201csame hat\u201d post from me, hopefully future SIL is emotionally healthier and going to do the work to get to a better place.", "I'm just going to say you might enjoy the musical \"A Shoggoth on the Roof\".\n\nBecause it's funny as hell, and some good tunes.", "So in my house, when I mention \"light pruning\" in the yard, it means get the chainsaw.\nIs \"light homocide\" kinda like that?", "People need to respect that rule more. There was another post here from a family member who wanted to bring their children to the destination country but have a babysitter for them during the childfree wedding. The OP was so audacious, to think her children will be allowed in the same country as the childfree wedding /s", "I have a friend like SIL. She's been married to the same guy for 23 years, and he is absolutely in love with her. They make it work\n\n\nOP, ignore the comments saying your brother needs to run. AITA is mainly teenagers and doesn't understand anything outside of black or white feelings. Also, that's not what you are asking.\n\nOP, you are NTA. Don't let SIL's actions prevent you from doing what you want. If she is that dramatic and wants to learn how to not be, she is most likely going to be able to get over this. Sounds like she reacts without thinking first. I was the same way, but I worked on that, and now I don't respond until I process what is happening and how I want to respond.", "I remember that. The specific exclusive destination that no one was allowed to use was\u2026.Hawaii!!", "That\u2019s true. I knew mine was coming too. Also the day that it did happen. I was like omg if he proposes here and now, would I feel surprised cause I kind of know? Well as we were looking over the waters and talking about how much the houses along the waters costed, I turned around and he was on one knee and I instantly cried. Lol.", "I just hope they don\u2019t have kids. I was raised by a pair of parents like this and it was torture. \n\nMom goes off and says things without thinking that are hurtful or confusing, dad laughs it off and this invalidates the kids being hurt or confused. \n\nKids learn to walk on eggshells around mom, dad doesn\u2019t understand the kids are living in fear because \u201cthat\u2019s just how Mom is\u201d.", "Does he think her theatrics are funny, or would he rather have her not be that way? Sounds like your future SIL may have found the perfect partner in your brother", "Your brother sounds like a saint.", "I hate to break it to you but she's not going to change honestly given everything you've said about your future sister-in-law I think you might want to stage an intervention with your brother, cuz I smell abuse and a future divorce.", "OP\u2019s gf wants to bring him to their graves. While not everyone would like that she might", "Make sure gf agrees first though!", "They are dead are we really going to harp on the word permission? They can\u2019t actually give it anyway", "Yeah, I\u2019d be quite annoyed if my partner did this. I wouldn\u2019t find it cute or respectful at all.", "My grandmother would reach out of the grave to smack a dude who tried that lmao", "*God* the light homicide comment hits home. I ended up living with them about five years longer than I intended because both of them had medical issues/2020 happened (she had pancreatitis that nearly killed her, he had cancer-- both fine now, luckily) and I swear I spent 3/4 of the time I was at home hiding in my room with earbuds on or escaping with my dad to take the dog on extended car rides lol. \n\nI think I saw OP say she's asked about finding a therapist in another comment. If I read that right it sounds like she's already on the road to doing better than either of our moms, so here's hoping she keeps it up!", "I'm a wedding officiant as a side hustle. Can confirm that this kind of behavior has become more and more common over the past decade or so. It drives me bonkers. Had a bride who was bullied into changing her wedding colors due to her SIL using similar colors at her wedding....4 years prior.", "She's likely the type that has birthday month. Even after the birthday.", "Personally, I don't give two figs about the idea of \"stealing attention\". It's rude to use an event someone else planned and paid for as a backdrop for yourself, that's it, that's the line. I will say that good taste would say not to do it in the couple days leading up. Once the day is over, it's over. Sorry for the post wedding let down. The event has passed and those memories are created. I think it's kinda weird that anyone thinks there's wedding buzz days after their wedding.\n\nAlso, I really hate to burst bubbles here... But no one really cares that much about either weddings or engagements. Sure they care, but they don't have hours long discussions about either. The really invested person may have an hour or two devoted to think about either thing. Being excited for either of you is not a particularly intense time sink.", "Omg the irony would be how she would steal the attention from her own by being SUCH a huge AH if she ruined her BIL\u2019s engagement. It\u2019s all anyone would remember about her wedding", "Ahaha oof. Thank you.", "I did.", "I had two sets of friends get married on consecutive days. Not only was there no drama, each couple happily attended the other wedding!", "Really.  Once the wedding is over, it's over.", "That's not how people like those work...", "Yeah valuing self worth is such a life changing trait I don\u2019t have haha", "Yeah, if I had to bet, it would be that his brother's mature and sensible way of handling a woman who is immature and nonsensical will succeed only in making what should have been a quick tour of crazytown into the trainwreck of his life, or at least one of them. It takes two to tango and to create a good marriage. Only one oar in the water results in going around in circles.", "That last bit just tickled me a little", "The fact that you're here asking for advise should give you a clue. \n\nStop trying to rationalize it and stop trying to blame SIL for your rudeness. It is in bad taste period.  \n\nDon't do it you have to make other arrangements. Let the SIL have her wedding. YTA", "She specifically rented out the entire Philippines for her wedding.  Every square inch of that place belongs only to her for the duration of the wedding and 1 year after.  Ain't nobody sullying her Philippines wedding!!!\n\n/s in case it wasn't fucking obvious.", "You didn\u2019t read the story. He\u2019s not proposing during any wedding festivities. He\u2019s doing it once they\u2019re gone on their honeymoon / while he and gf are exploring gf\u2019s homeland.", "Bridezilla trying to call dibs on a whole country! It's so fucking offensive to tell a Filipina-American she can't do a family vacation in the Philippines.", "Sounds like the Bridzilla who was getting married in Canada and didn't even want her sister's kids in the country for their destination wedding.", "Honestly, anyone who plans on cohabiting with a partner should read that book.", "its literally just been explained how their brother is fine with his situation.  fucking armchair psychologist, just having to have your say.", "How did the *sister* live that long? I would've cold-clocked her with a frying pan by the end of puberty!", "No one should have to take you seriously if you're being a drama queen without reason.", "I wish I was there!", "Yes, we are. Because language defines reality, and this is the year of humanity twelve thousand twenty fucking three, or in other words, *entirely too goddamned long for women to STILL be considered fucking property*."]}
