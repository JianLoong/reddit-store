Also, personally, I hate the doubling-up of celebrations - I don't understand why anyone would try to reduce the time that they're happy for (i.e. people who propose at New Year or on a birthday so they don't have two separate celebrations). If you propose whilst you're already on holiday then you're effectively piling happiness onto happiness when it's already hit it's ceiling. If you propose on a \"nothing\" occasion, just another random day, then you've got double the happiness. She's being Bridezilla, like many very lovely and rational women become - you have the opportunity to avoid causing a permanent issue.

Within an hour, they've told ten other relatives that you're proposing and the gossip will be whispered as she's walking down the aisle. When you're giving your toast, one overly drunk uncle will yell \"are you gonna propose?\" and the focus will be on you and your girlfriend.

Apparently the bride thinks she now owns the Philippines and anything a former wedding guest does there that isn't all about her is forbidden.
