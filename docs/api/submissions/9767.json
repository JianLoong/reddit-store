It was my husband and myself, plus our two young kids - 5 and 2. It wasn\u2019t a particularly busy night but there were a few parties spread out throughout the various holes on the course. We noticed there was a large group that seemed to be creating some commotion nearby (3-4 kids around ages 7-9 plus probably 3 sets of parents). The kids were running between various holes with their putters and golf balls, jumping into the middle as people were playing, hitting other people\u2019s balls - just generally being rude and unruly. The parents were just nonchalantly walking along and chatting, and not saying anything to the kids as this was happening. Somewhere halfway through the course, these kids came up to where we were putting and just ran onto our hole as we were in the middle of our turn. I firmly told one of the kids, hey, you can\u2019t do that, please wait your turn - we are finishing up. He kinda shrugged and they ran off to go hit their ball in another hole. \n\n\nThis continued but they left us alone until the last hole, where the kids in that group ran back and just started grabbing our golf balls, screaming, and walking all over the final hole while we were playing. I saw one of the fathers in that group nearby and I (sort of annoyed at this point) told him to get a handle on his kids since they\u2019re being super disruptive to other people. For some reason he took a lot of offense and replied \u201ccan\u2019t you hear I\u2019m telling them not to do it\u201d (actually I heard none of that - the parents were just in conversation in their own world). And he also said that \u201cthis is a kids place, everyone is having fun\u201d. Umm no, it\u2019s a mini golf course and I\u2019m no stickler for golf etiquette but your kids are literally just trampling everywhere as people are playing, with no regard for anyone else. I kind of snapped at him and told him his kids shouldn\u2019t be jumping into other peoples turns, and ruining the game for others and that there\u2019s rules on how to act on a mini golf course. He eventually walked away with his family and muttered something snarky under his breath as he was going to a different part of the course. \n\n\nIt was hole 18 for us so we just left afterward but in the car ride home, I was wondering if I should have just left well enough alone and not said anything to the parent (it honestly accomplished nothing). A couple of the parties nearby were looking my way as I was having words with this parent, which made me think maybe I overreacted.

I raised my voice and possibly made a scene. I accused him and his family for being unruly. As a result, he called me various snarky names under his breath as he was walking away and two other couples nearby started giving me dirty looks (my voice definitely carried more than this person I was berating). I\u2019m likely being seen as the asshole by both that family and some of the patrons nearby, but I think my actions were justified. My husband made me think I could have handled it differently (being less mean). So I\u2019m conflicted on how to think about this interaction\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
