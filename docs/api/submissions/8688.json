I told her it would still cause me to breakout and be extremely uncomfortable and itchy. She called me selfish for \"not pushing through uncomfortablness for her big day\" and I responded by telling her I don't care if she's the bride and it's her day it doesn't give her the right to force someone to wear something that causes them extreme physical discomfort and she was the selfish one. I also told her if I had to wear that jewelry I wouldn't be part of the wedding.

AITA for calling her selfish and refusing to wear the gold jewelry?\n\nEdit: I've texted her and gave her some of the suggestions like a coating I could wear. She doesn't want to risk ruining the jewelry because it was expensive, but she said I can wear a fake lookalike. The problem now is she wants me to pay for the new fake accessories since I was unable to wear what she purchased.

Don\u2019t tell the bride you have found a coating for it. She is AH. Instead of insisting you wear it she could have sat down with you to find a solution.", "NTA. Does she have any allergies, I wonder how she feel if roles were reversed. It\u2019s good she said you can wear a fake version but she should never have put you in this position", "NTA.\nSarah is being a complete bridezilla. I get wanting everything and everyone to look and be perfect, but maybe communicate with everyone before making a decision on something as mundane as jewelry \ud83d\ude12\nAs for fake look-alikes? Amazon, or even a DIY path, will be your best friend. I would also suggest Shein or Wish since they are relatively cheap, but who knows how long it would take for the jewelry to come in.", "NTA\n\nHave you tried medications to off set any possible allergic reactions? With the type of reaction you are describing, benadryl might be enough to hold off any reactions for the short time you would be expected to wear the jewelry. Otherwise, if that's not any option, have her send back the initial jewelry she bought for you and exchange it for the fake jewelry. Sounds like it would be a less expensive option for the bride!", "Regarding your edit, put your foot down and say no. You didn't suggest it, she did, and it's once again something that can't work for you. You didn't force her to buy the original jewelry, that was her choice. If she can't accept that, then reconsider the wedding and/or tell John how this is putting you in a bind. You shouldn't have to compromise your health or finances for something so small in a wedding.", "NTA\n\nSucks that you can't wear gold. The bride can make an exception for you.  Plus, she should have asked if any of the bridesmaids had allergies before buying everyone jewelry.  That's on her.", "NTA.\n\nAnd, if she knew you were allergic to gold jewelry, replacement fakes are on her. She's the one who opted to buy something she KNEW you were allergic to. She can keep the stuff she purchased and return it, or regift it, or do whatever she likes with it.\n\nI'd be rethinking participating in a wedding where the bride thought triggering an allergic reaction in her wedding party was an acceptable option.", "NTA. As someone with a severe nickle allergy (and therefore knows your pain) you should 100% not wear jewelry that makes you break out. If you wore it like she asked you to (just for the ceremony and pictures) it would still be a few hours which is plenty of time to break out in a horrible rash that takes WEEKS to heal properly. \n\nAs to making you pay for the look-alikes... Why couldn't she return the jewelry for you and buy another set that doesn't cause you to break out?", "NTA. I\u2019m sure people are sick of the term Bridezilla, but it applies here. We need to send a clear message to people getting married that \u201cit\u2018s my special day\u201d isn\u2019t a free pass to be an asshole to your friends.

(It's kinda' on her that she ordered something you are allergic to and expected you to wear it.)\n\nSadly, she may think she's already doing you a big favor by \"letting\" you avoid a rash and discomfort and not want to pay for the fake set. Hopefully an acceptable fake set won't cost that much. In the end, you can only do your best and be honest about what you can and can't do (as you did here with the gold jewelry).", "NTA, but I've had this situation. we just coated the parts that would touch my skin in clear nail polish till I could take it off", "NTA. I was also thinking of putting a clear coating on the jewelry so it wouldn't actually touch your skin. But I don't understand why the bride is concerned about it ruining the jewelry. Is she planning on keeping it herself? If it's meant to be yours, then there shouldn't be an issue with doing that. Everyone would be happy. Youd be wearing the jewelry she picked out, with no rash.", "NTA Friends don\u2019t put friends through physical discomfort for selfish reasons .\n\nWhen I got married, I specifically asked for jewelry my bridesmaids could wear for sensitive skin.", "NTA. If you cannot afford the fake just bow out. Better to be a guest at this point. I also break out wearing metal jewelry and the fakes will probably be worse for your skin. Save yourself the pain.", "NTA - are you so sensitive to it that you couldn't wear it at all for the 20 min ceremony then a more times for pictures and such?  I wouldn't want to be playing the on/off game all day but it's only a couple of hours total.   But if you are extremely sensitive then you just can't do it.

No one will notice.  \n\nTell her you so pay her 3x the cost of the jewelry of anyone every looks at her wedding photos and asks why one bridesmaid doesn't have on a necklace.", "NTA. I have a metal allergy; the reactions are painful, and (at least with me) the rash lasts a lot longer than the time it was worn.  Bride is unreasonable.", "NTA, but are you sure this isn't an allergy to the nickel in cheaper grades of gold?\n\nIf she has actually spent good money on this jewellery you might be fine?", "She's asking you to pay for jewelry for a destination wedding because she bought something she knew you couldn't wear and told you to deal with being in pain because she cares more about her pictures than your health.  Where you should go from here is out of the bridal party.  NTA", "NTA\n\nI'm similar with some jewelry so I get it. Why would she want you all broken out for the photos? I hope a compromise can be reached but yeah NTA.", "NTA i'd be tempted to give her visual proof of your allergy in some way and be like \"do you really want this in your wedding pictures?\"", "NTA. I\u2019m allergic to white gold myself. It\u2019s a pain.", "NTA. She can get her money back for the jewelry she bought you and put it towards having the photographer edit the photos to make it look like you're wearing it. She's ridiculous.", "NTA! Bride is insensitive and also not thinking this demand through - does she want one of her bridesmaids to have a rash in all of the pictures? It will totally draw attention from her.", "NTA\n\nThe Same Photoshop that they would use to photoshop out your rash and skin reaction can just photoshop in the jewelry. Am I missing something?", "Is it possible to get the same accessories but in fake gold", "NTA How can she not understand that rash and hives on a bridesmaid are certainly going to liven up her photographs? As would your suffering anguished face!", "Basically cough up the money she\u2019s ok with an alternative\u2026 you need to be ok with it as well. She bought the first jewelry you can pony up the money for the second set.", "Have you seen if she would be willing to use a wood shellac coating? As far as I know, it won't do any harm to the Jewelry and can easily be removed with some alcohol after you are done with it. As long as you aren't sensitive to it, it should work great for temporary coating on the jewelry.", "Try clear nail varnish over the gold - I\u2019m sensitive to nickel and get a rash with belts etc, and this has always worked. Bottom line, I do agree with you - but this might be a hack that helps you (or others!) down the line. Let the nail polish dry (duh!) before wearing it.", "NTA. and based on the edit I honestly would just not go as part of the wedding party. She knew you had this allergy and bought this jewelry anyway expecting you to wear it. Then now expects you to purchase the other jewelry to wear because of her bad choice. You cannot afford that...so. I honestly would just drop out of the wedding party and come as a guest if she is not going to", "Does thick theatre makeup protect your skin (I don\u2019t know enough).

It causes my skin to turn pink and for the skin to pucker up (think about how your fingers look after you've been swimming for over an hour) but stay puckered for 24+ hours.  A friend didn't believe me, and since the reaction isn't painful, I put a band-aid on and took it off 5 minutes later and showed them what happened.  I also showed them the spot the next day and they saw it was still puckered.  Now, that's more of an annoying allergy, it doesn't cause any physical discomfort.  So IDK if it's worth it for you to prove to her that your allergy is real.", "OP suggested a coting, but the bride doesn't want to \"ruin\" the jewelry.", "A lot of weddings are long. There's the getting dressed/make up/hair done, the getting to the venue, taking the photos, the ceremony itself, more pictures, whatever procession/dance events they have for the bridal party, and then the reception. And whatever extra tidbits the bride and groom throw in. Just four hours into wearing the jewelry will have her breaking out in the middle of the wedding.\n\n\n\nI couldn't wear yellow gold and makeup together.

As I grew and got into piercings more I discovered that implant grade titanium is the only thing that won't lead to a nightmare while healing.", "I think you're being reasonable saying no to paying for the replacement. Like you said, she was aware you're allergic to gold and ordered it anyway for you, and none of the other bridesmaids are contributing to the cost of jewelry, so you're being singled out for having an allergy. It is her mistake to fix or she can just let you not wear any jewelry.\n\nIf you're more friends with her fiance than her, I think your best bet is to have a conversation with both of them. Not one or the other."]}
