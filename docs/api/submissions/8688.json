{"id": 8688, "submission_id": "10p3zcj", "title": "AITA for refusing to wear jewelry the bride picked?", "selftext": "I (24 F) am a bridesmaid in my friends (24M we will call \"John\" and 25F we will call \"Sarah\") wedding. I have been friends with John since middle school, and me and his fiance have also become great friends over the 4 years they have been together, so I of course said yes when she asked me to be a bridesmaid. The wedding is in March, and last month we had started discussing bridesmaids attire. Dresses and shoes have been picked out and ordered, and yesterday all 3 of the bridesmaids (including me) and Sarah were discussing the accessories, and to our surprise she had already ordered some. It's all gold jewelry. It's beautiful but the only issue is gold always causes me to break out and become rashy and she knows this! I told her I couldn't wear it, and she said it was her day and I wouldn't have to wear it for very long just during the ceremony and pictures and she didn't think it would be a big deal because \"it's not like it would kill me\". I told her it would still cause me to breakout and be extremely uncomfortable and itchy. She called me selfish for \"not pushing through uncomfortablness for her big day\" and I responded by telling her I don't care if she's the bride and it's her day it doesn't give her the right to force someone to wear something that causes them extreme physical discomfort and she was the selfish one. I also told her if I had to wear that jewelry I wouldn't be part of the wedding. The other bridesmaids think I'm being too harsh, but my friend John is on my side and has been trying to talk to his fiance and convince her to let me wear different jewelry. AITA for calling her selfish and refusing to wear the gold jewelry?\n\nEdit: I've texted her and gave her some of the suggestions like a coating I could wear. She doesn't want to risk ruining the jewelry because it was expensive, but she said I can wear a fake lookalike. The problem now is she wants me to pay for the new fake accessories since I was unable to wear what she purchased. I'm already on an extremely tight budget, and have been taking on extra time at work to set money aside for the hotel and travel expenses for their wedding. I'm not exactly sure where to go from here.\n\nEdit #2: I'm reluctant to pay for the replacement jewelry because she was well aware of my allergy beforehand. We (Sarah and all bridesmaids) had agreed that she would pay for dresses, accessories, shoes, and any other clothing or similar items she would want us to wear. She said we would only be responsible for our hotel, travel, and hair and makeup. I don't think it's fair I pay for a replacement when she knew beforehand and it was agreed upon before she was paying for accessories.\n\nEdit #3: Apparently Sarah had talked to John about the whole thing and he was on my side of the situation. She messaged me and told me after she talked to him about it that she realized she was taking things too far and she said she was not going to make me pay for the replacements. She apologized and said she's been stressed, and she didn't realize the extent of my allergy. I accepted her apology so we can move forward, but it still bothers me a little that even if she thought my allergy very mild she was expecting me to suffer through an allergic reaction for her wedding.", "created_utc": 1675088928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p3zcj/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_jewelry_the_bride_picked/", "score": 1169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
