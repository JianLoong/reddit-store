Her message to you should have been, \u201cjust to let you know, the childcare for Thursday fell through. I\u2019m trying to find another option, or I might take the day off so I can watch the kids. Hope you\u2019re having a nice trip\u201d. That\u2019s what I would do for my husband.\nIt\u2019s a family unit, everyone needs to work together to figure things out when things happen, not shove the problem onto one member of the family\u2019s plate.\nAlso, I\u2019d hate to even think of my husband rushing home on his motorcycle for this reason. Motorcycles are already so unsafe, let alone adding the factors of driving 20 hrs without sleep.", "NTA and it seems really petty of her to insist on you coming back. In the same situation I can't imagine ruining a trip my partner was on, over something like this. Did she not want you to go?", "NTA. That's a safety thing, you shouldn't be driving that long. No reason she couldn't sort something out, especially if she's getting vacation as well. I wouldn't have come back.", "NTA Honestly? I wouldn\u2019t have gone back if I were you, and I\u2019m guessing that if you ask around you\u2019ll find that the childcare didn\u2019t spontaneously fall through. She wanted you to come home. The end. I think you should take your trip again in the next few weeks.", "NTA - She's a grown woman she should have been able to figure out child care by herself. Seems to me that she is mad that you are going on vacation yourself and found away to force you to be home. I'd be petty and an \"issue\" would come up and she wouldn't be able to go on her august trip, But that's just me cuz I'm petty AF.", "NTA for being mad and I\u2019m surprised you headed back. That is a lot.", "NTA, your wife should have sorted out the childcare.", "Info: has she given any reason why she didn't want to use the alternatives you suggested? Why it absolutely had to be you despite you being so far away?", "NTA, you are an amazing dad to drop everything for your kids.  She did something selfish and was unwilling to do something for the family.  \n\nYou do need to talk to her about this and let her know what you think about it, that is a one time discussion and then drop it. \n\nYou have a right to be upset, try not to dwell on that, focus on what an amazing dad you are or you\u2019ll start feeling contempt for her.", "NTA.  Though I'm tempted with an E S H because actually caving and driving 20 hours straight was really reckless.  You should've just told her what she was asking was impossible and made back home as soon as you could safely.", "NTA. There were multiple alternatives to the situation she could have tried, but refused. Also depending on how long you were awake before the call, you would have at least 24+ hours with no sleep, which could have gotten you into a crash!", "NTA. Apparently you having to ride 20 hours is just fine, even though it\u2019s very dangerous.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is a huge AH for not being able to manage the kids. This is especially worse because she takes her own vacations", "NTA. You need breaks when riding\u2014and that she wants you to risk bad judgment (e.g. poor judgment when cornering, losing ability to keep focus and pay attention to surroundings) because she won\u2019t use her PTO to cover for a childcare issue (and does her own solo vacations).

I suspect your wife wasn't on board with your plans before you left, and you either didn't pick up on her feelings or chose to ignore them. Hence, I'm including you in the AH category. \n\nHowever, your wife is clearly the bigger AH because she should have used her words ahead of time and been more reasonable once you were already gone, and getting home required an unsafe 20-hour drive. However, if you didn't want to go back to watch the kids, why didn't you arrange for a sleepover for them? Seems like you had access to a phone and making a few calls could have saved you from having to cut your trip short.", "NTA.  She should have figured this out.", "NTA, but either is your wife.  The kids are the responsibility of both you.  You should have found alternative childcare if she couldn't.  She is not ultimately responsible any more than you are.  You are both parents and your presumption that it should ultimately be her problem because you want to vacation is out of line.", "YTA.\n\nYou have an entire freaking summer off and you want your wife to burn PTO so you can joyride.

I don\u2019t take personal time.", "To be fair to her the childcare did fall through. That part I am not upset about.", "No idea. She has nothing.", "Bingo. There's almost always something else going on that OPs, especially when it's a guy and it comes to parenting, doesn't include because it often shines more onto things which makes them less the victim.", "It is so out of character for her to do this I came home.", "They should be in agreement on things like this, yes. But to say that he should have read her mind or should not have gotten to do an activity that she did not want to participate in because she didn't want him to, even though she has trips for herself as well, is taking it a little too far", "The trip was her idea. She pushed me to go as I didn\u2019t want to because I felt it would inconvenience me due to taking some university courses. \n\nI had arrangements made for a sleepover with my mom, but my wife wouldn\u2019t drive them there. I guess I could have tried getting other phone numbers from my wife, I don\u2019t have the numbers, but it did not dawn on me at the time. It was a pretty hostile phone conversation and I try not to argue on the phone.", "So your logic is that he should read her mind? They are not high schoolers.\n\nIf she wants something she should be clear. Stating her mind doesn't seem to be her issue given how quickly she demanded he comes back", "No. He had everything lined up & was GONE. At that point, it\u2019s her responsibility to handle whatever comes up. He can hardly manage care from 1000 miles away. She could have taken the day off or set up the kids with their friends. She just wanted him to come home and therefore refused to be accommodating.", "So she is NOT responsible more than him, but, HE is responsible more than her.  Nonsense.  He should have found childcare?  Where?  20 hours away from home?  She is as incompetent as a parent, as he is as a pushover.

NTA", "So... he organised childcare before leaving so his wife wouldn't have to worry, he suggests very reasonable alternatives while he is 20 hours away so he doesn't have to do a dangerous rush back, yet somehow he's putting the burden on his wife?\n\nHis wife's allowed go away without him in June and will be in August. But his only vacation on his own in 14 years is somehow shirking parental responsibility...?", "What exactly is \u201call the burden\u201d? One day fell through and I gave her alternatives? Even if she chose not to use PTO a sleepover was entirely possible.", "Yeah well, three days into your vacation, she changed her mind and \\*snap\\* summoned you back home. So much for your personal time, eh?\n\nNTA for feeling choked, OP.\n\nCan't help suspecting that one or more of these is in play:\n\n* your wife couldn't hack solo parenting, even with daycare;\n* she resents the idea of you being off joyriding on the motorcycle since she doesn't share that hobby with you;\n* she's hating her life generally and you just became the lightning rod for her discontent, so she figured f\\*ck you and your road-trip.\n\nOnly you can determine if any of those is true. Start digging, OP. If she won't have a frank and open discussion, tell her that you won't facilitate her solo August vacation unless she starts seeing a counsellor with you, in July. Period.\n\nAnd never, EVER risk a 20-hour ride interstate ride again, OP. Sleep deprivation counts as legal \"impairment\" in many jurisdictions, for good reason. Your reflexes and general alertness were utterly compromised. On a motorbike, one blinky moment or one surprise deer at 90mph and you could have been toast.\n\n...You're no good to your kids if you're dead, eh?", "Because she wants to use them when she wants it and not spend it to watch kids duh !", "Like other people have said, I suggest you look deeper into this.\n\nShe wanted you to risk a 20hr drive on a motorcycle to take care of the children for one day (I am thinking just one day because you mention childcare fell through for Thursday and don't mention for Friday as well, when you return Saturday)  instead of arranging alternatives. Aka she wanted you to risk your life to cater to her.\n\nIt's important to figure out why this is happened, since it's not really normal to want your spouse to risk their lives for something so fixable.\n\nDefinitely seek couples counselling, this might be a sign of a deeper issue.", "Would be curious what you think that could be.", "Almost always something? What are basing this off of?", "Wait, am I reading this right? The reason the childcare fell through is that your wife didn't want to get the kids to the childcare??  That driving was too much, but your 20 hour ride was okay?? O.O", "yo OP this is a pretty big thing to include in the original post. Throw an edit in there: \"The 'childcare fell through' because she did not want to drive them to my mothers house\" \n\nLike what's that about? Do they hate each other?
