Start digging, OP. If she won't have a frank and open discussion, tell her that you won't facilitate her solo August vacation unless she starts seeing a counsellor with you, in July. Period.\n\nAnd never, EVER risk a 20-hour ride interstate ride again, OP. Sleep deprivation counts as legal \"impairment\" in many jurisdictions, for good reason. Your reflexes and general alertness were utterly compromised. On a motorbike, one blinky moment or one surprise deer at 90mph and you could have been toast.\n\n...You're no good to your kids if you're dead, eh?", "Because she wants to use them when she wants it and not spend it to watch kids duh !", "Like other people have said, I suggest you look deeper into this.\n\nShe wanted you to risk a 20hr drive on a motorcycle to take care of the children for one day (I am thinking just one day because you mention childcare fell through for Thursday and don't mention for Friday as well, when you return Saturday)  instead of arranging alternatives. Aka she wanted you to risk your life to cater to her.\n\nIt's important to figure out why this is happened, since it's not really normal to want your spouse to risk their lives for something so fixable.\n\nDefinitely seek couples counselling, this might be a sign of a deeper issue.", "Would be curious what you think that could be.", "Almost always something?

And if their reaponse to the other person's behavior doesn't make sense, they're probably leaving something out (e.g. my completley normal wife demanded that Indeive 20 hours straight back from a vacation she suggested I take because she changed her mind about caring for our children which would have required a 45 minite drive, but I didn't think anything of driving straight back eventhough this was compeletely out ofncharacter for her, and yet I'm not worried about her, just irritated that I didn't get to finish my vacation). \n\nFor example, if wife did not support the trip and OP went anyway, then while still childish, wife's behavior would at least make some sense. Or if wife has a history of erratic, selfish behavior, it would make sense that OP drove 20 hours straight on wife's whim without really questioning it or attempting any other solution including calling the children's friends to see if they could sleep over so OP could continue his vacation as planned.
