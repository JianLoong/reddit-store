He was asked to be a best man last year and I was asked to be a bridesmaid on the same day. He has been friends with the groom (A) since they were in elementary school and I met him and his fianc\u00e9e (L) when we started dating. \n\nI became friends with them and we see them every few months due to them living about an hour and a half away. Last year, they got engaged and less than a month after, they asked both of us to be in the wedding party and we said yes. Their wedding is next year and they\u2019ve had the wedding venue and vendors booked since last year. \n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. I am 1 of 4 bridesmaids, who all live an hour and a half away from L. We aren\u2019t friends with each other but obviously have come together and celebrated L when she\u2019s made plans to want to get together, see the venue, go dress shopping, etc. She also said that we can wear whatever dress we want as long as it\u2019s within her color pallet but she expected us to show her our dresses first. So I send her 5 options I was looking at and she tells me to buy all of them so she can see them on me. Okay, no problem. I can return Amazon dresses and dresses in store but it\u2019s a little annoying. I send pictures of them on and she vetoed all of them and sends me dresses she likes that are out of my price range and also a style that I don\u2019t like. I send her another dress that\u2019s non-refundable since it\u2019s final sale and she says it\u2019s super cute and she likes it but wants me to try it on before she says yes. So over a year before the actual wedding, I buy the dress and send her a picture and she loves it. Thank god. \n\nFast forward to about a week ago, I receive a phone call from my fianc\u00e9 telling me that A told him to tell me I was out of the wedding because L is getting rid of all of her bridesmaids. About 6 hours after I get the same text the rest of the bridesmaids got that basically says: I\u2019ve decided to go with different people that live closer to me because it\u2019s too hard to get everyone together. I wish I would\u2019ve put more thought into picking out my bridesmaids, I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d care this much about my wedding. \n\nMy response was basically: this comes as a complete shock, I\u2019ve been there for you for everything and I\u2019ve texted you about the wedding and I\u2019m even doing her hair, makeup, and staying sober during the wedding to take care of all the little things while she enjoys her night. What did I do wrong? \n\nShe responds by saying I didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I haven\u2019t been doing enough. \n\nSo, my dilemma is: do I still wear the bridesmaid dress because I can\u2019t return it and I spent the money on it or do I buy a new dress to show respect and not wear the color that all the new bridesmaids are wearing? My friends are split on if I\u2019d be the asshole.", "created_utc": 1692766892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ytsxu/aita_for_wearing_a_bridesmaid_dress_to_a_wedding/", "score": 843, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But don't spend another cent on that wedding. Any gift for the couple is from your fiance, your gift was a year of effort to be kicked out of bridal party. But mate, don't wear the dress. It's a bad idea.\n\nIf you wear it ESH. It's not worth it. Choose a dress you already have. Wear that. Save the bridesmaid dress for other future occasions that aren't that wedding. And don't spend money on this women again.", "NTA.  Wear the dress, but modify it by wearing a shawl, one of those shoulder jackets ( can\u2019t think of the word right now), a sash, etc in a different color, and make sure your shoes don\u2019t match the dress.  *OR* you could do what I would, and not go at all.

She might keep the color and then it will look like a dig at her. For my part, I wouldn\u2019t attend after this. For her to do this in the first place is out of line but to not even call you or be kind or apologetic? No way would I be contributing the way you were planning to before this happened. At most, I would show as a guest, but probably not even that unless she really made an effort to reconnect in a positive way.", "most likely YWBTA if you wear the dress as is, since that's the title question. That being said, you aare not at fault here and this is very rude/messed up of the bride AND pretty ridiculous. If she wanted more from you, she should have established those expectations when she asked you.\n\nTo explain the verdict: it's very very rude to show up in what is obviously a bridesmaids dress to the wedding. It will likely cause problems, and even if we know your reasons, her third cousin Jenny will not. Unless they've changed the color/it's very different from what her new bridesmaids are wearing, do not wear that dress to this event. You do not, however, need to purchase a new dress, wear a particularily nice dress (meet the dress code-barely- and wearing slacks would be fine), or do anything else at this point beyond what you are already certain you're committed to. \n\nGiven that it's your fiancee's best friend's wedding I assume that you still feel obligated to attend and do hair/make up. If they are not paying you, consider making it clear that this is their wedding gift. Do not spend more money on this wedding (at least not the bride's side) if it can be avoided. If you own a dress that's nice enough for church, it is probably nice enough for this wedding. If you don't, consider potentially dying it? Much cheaper than a new dress, and probably well worth it not to 'spoil' the wedding day. The issue is only whether or not you look like a bridesmaid, not whether you wear that specific dress tbh. Do test swatches first, obviously, but there's a lot of good dyes out there! Or buy a cheap dress. As long as you avoid that specific color and meet whatever dress code there is, you're all good", "Wear it, with a sign sour your neck, \u201cex-bridesmaid\u201d", "Hard NTA. The bride definitely is an AH for blindsiding you like this. If you \"haven't been doing enough\" are you still expected to do her hair and makeup? If so, I hope that you're charging her.

Either she reimburses you the cost of the dress and you will wear something else, or you are forced to wear the expensive dress to the wedding.   Ball is in her court.", "You shouldn\u2019t go, especially if you\u2019re going to be pre-irritated and aggravated every time there\u2019s emphasis on the replacement bridesmaids.\n\nAre you supposedly still working the event but now you\u2019re just not a part of it and you\u2019ll sit alone in the back?\n\nMaybe see if you can bus tables and valet cars", "Wear it by all means if you want to, but why would you choose to attend the wedding of someone like that at all?", "NTA but she sure is. \n\nWow. And everyone is going along with this?\n\nI'm honestly surprised you're still going. Part of me thinks I'd withdraw all support but the petty side of me says go and wear the dress. Doesn't matter what she thinks. Friendship might be hurt either way now. \n\nIf you suck it up and buy a new dress you'll always resent her and get no support from the guys because they'll think it doesn't bother you, if you wear the one you bought you'll get the \"she ruined the wedding\" reaction. Its going to be so awkward with any hang-outs now, and someone needs to get on telling her to act right.", "Where is your fianc\u00e9 in all this? He should back out of the wedding in support of you.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think you should wear the dress. Come up with something else.

Grow a back bone and stand up for yourself.", "NTA, and, personally, I wouldn't go.", "If you still want to go, find out if she's keeping the same color for bridesmaids. In that she's changed the women involved, she might change that, too. If she has, no problem. If she hasn't, then don't wear the dress. It's a financial loss, but with luck you'll be able to wear the dress somewhere else and if not, spend a little less on the wedding present to recoup the cost.\n\nBut you have no obligation to do her hair or makeup anymore.

When we sat down for the ceremony, we were surprised to see that my dress was the exact same color as the bridemaids, and somehow in the same style as it was a long length dress. Everyone found it funny and it made for a great family picture as we were in the wedding color theme.\nI also know of multiple weddings where the couple communicated their theme color to their guests so that everyone came dressed in these colors or with an accessory of said color...\n\nUnless clearly stated in the invitation (\"don't wear this color\"), I don't think wearing the same color as the bridemaid is rude, especially since someone may wear it by chance or by trying to stick to the theme the couple has chosen.

It is a service that people normally pay for and as such it could serve as OP's gift if the bride isn't paying them.
