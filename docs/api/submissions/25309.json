He was asked to be a best man last year and I was asked to be a bridesmaid on the same day. He has been friends with the groom (A) since they were in elementary school and I met him and his fianc\u00e9e (L) when we started dating. \n\nI became friends with them and we see them every few months due to them living about an hour and a half away. Last year, they got engaged and less than a month after, they asked both of us to be in the wedding party and we said yes. Their wedding is next year and they\u2019ve had the wedding venue and vendors booked since last year. \n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. I am 1 of 4 bridesmaids, who all live an hour and a half away from L. We aren\u2019t friends with each other but obviously have come together and celebrated L when she\u2019s made plans to want to get together, see the venue, go dress shopping, etc. She also said that we can wear whatever dress we want as long as it\u2019s within her color pallet but she expected us to show her our dresses first. So I send her 5 options I was looking at and she tells me to buy all of them so she can see them on me. Okay, no problem. I can return Amazon dresses and dresses in store but it\u2019s a little annoying. I send pictures of them on and she vetoed all of them and sends me dresses she likes that are out of my price range and also a style that I don\u2019t like. I send her another dress that\u2019s non-refundable since it\u2019s final sale and she says it\u2019s super cute and she likes it but wants me to try it on before she says yes. So over a year before the actual wedding, I buy the dress and send her a picture and she loves it. Thank god. \n\nFast forward to about a week ago, I receive a phone call from my fianc\u00e9 telling me that A told him to tell me I was out of the wedding because L is getting rid of all of her bridesmaids. About 6 hours after I get the same text the rest of the bridesmaids got that basically says: I\u2019ve decided to go with different people that live closer to me because it\u2019s too hard to get everyone together. I wish I would\u2019ve put more thought into picking out my bridesmaids, I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d care this much about my wedding. \n\nMy response was basically: this comes as a complete shock, I\u2019ve been there for you for everything and I\u2019ve texted you about the wedding and I\u2019m even doing her hair, makeup, and staying sober during the wedding to take care of all the little things while she enjoys her night. What did I do wrong? \n\nShe responds by saying I didn\u2019t do anything wrong but I haven\u2019t been doing enough. \n\nSo, my dilemma is: do I still wear the bridesmaid dress because I can\u2019t return it and I spent the money on it or do I buy a new dress to show respect and not wear the color that all the new bridesmaids are wearing? My friends are split on if I\u2019d be the asshole.", "created_utc": 1692766892, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ytsxu/aita_for_wearing_a_bridesmaid_dress_to_a_wedding/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But don't spend another cent on that wedding. Any gift for the couple is from your fiance, your gift was a year of effort to be kicked out of bridal party. But mate, don't wear the dress. It's a bad idea.\n\nIf you wear it ESH. It's not worth it. Choose a dress you already have. Wear that. Save the bridesmaid dress for other future occasions that aren't that wedding. And don't spend money on this women again.", "NTA.  Wear the dress, but modify it by wearing a shawl, one of those shoulder jackets ( can\u2019t think of the word right now), a sash, etc in a different color, and make sure your shoes don\u2019t match the dress.  *OR* you could do what I would, and not go at all.

She might keep the color and then it will look like a dig at her. For my part, I wouldn\u2019t attend after this. For her to do this in the first place is out of line but to not even call you or be kind or apologetic? No way would I be contributing the way you were planning to before this happened. At most, I would show as a guest, but probably not even that unless she really made an effort to reconnect in a positive way.", "most likely YWBTA if you wear the dress as is, since that's the title question. That being said, you aare not at fault here and this is very rude/messed up of the bride AND pretty ridiculous. If she wanted more from you, she should have established those expectations when she asked you.\n\nTo explain the verdict: it's very very rude to show up in what is obviously a bridesmaids dress to the wedding. It will likely cause problems, and even if we know your reasons, her third cousin Jenny will not. Unless they've changed the color/it's very different from what her new bridesmaids are wearing, do not wear that dress to this event. You do not, however, need to purchase a new dress, wear a particularily nice dress (meet the dress code-barely- and wearing slacks would be fine), or do anything else at this point beyond what you are already certain you're committed to. \n\nGiven that it's your fiancee's best friend's wedding I assume that you still feel obligated to attend and do hair/make up. If they are not paying you, consider making it clear that this is their wedding gift. Do not spend more money on this wedding (at least not the bride's side) if it can be avoided. If you own a dress that's nice enough for church, it is probably nice enough for this wedding. If you don't, consider potentially dying it? Much cheaper than a new dress, and probably well worth it not to 'spoil' the wedding day. The issue is only whether or not you look like a bridesmaid, not whether you wear that specific dress tbh. Do test swatches first, obviously, but there's a lot of good dyes out there! Or buy a cheap dress. As long as you avoid that specific color and meet whatever dress code there is, you're all good", "Wear it, with a sign sour your neck, \u201cex-bridesmaid\u201d", "Hard NTA. The bride definitely is an AH for blindsiding you like this. If you \"haven't been doing enough\" are you still expected to do her hair and makeup? If so, I hope that you're charging her.

Either she reimburses you the cost of the dress and you will wear something else, or you are forced to wear the expensive dress to the wedding.   Ball is in her court.", "You shouldn\u2019t go, especially if you\u2019re going to be pre-irritated and aggravated every time there\u2019s emphasis on the replacement bridesmaids.\n\nAre you supposedly still working the event but now you\u2019re just not a part of it and you\u2019ll sit alone in the back?\n\nMaybe see if you can bus tables and valet cars", "Wear it by all means if you want to, but why would you choose to attend the wedding of someone like that at all?", "NTA but she sure is. \n\nWow. And everyone is going along with this?\n\nI'm honestly surprised you're still going. Part of me thinks I'd withdraw all support but the petty side of me says go and wear the dress. Doesn't matter what she thinks. Friendship might be hurt either way now. \n\nIf you suck it up and buy a new dress you'll always resent her and get no support from the guys because they'll think it doesn't bother you, if you wear the one you bought you'll get the \"she ruined the wedding\" reaction. Its going to be so awkward with any hang-outs now, and someone needs to get on telling her to act right.", "Where is your fianc\u00e9 in all this? He should back out of the wedding in support of you.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think you should wear the dress. Come up with something else.

Grow a back bone and stand up for yourself.", "NTA, and, personally, I wouldn't go.", "If you still want to go, find out if she's keeping the same color for bridesmaids. In that she's changed the women involved, she might change that, too. If she has, no problem. If she hasn't, then don't wear the dress. It's a financial loss, but with luck you'll be able to wear the dress somewhere else and if not, spend a little less on the wedding present to recoup the cost.\n\nBut you have no obligation to do her hair or makeup anymore.

You don\u2019t owe her anything, she owes you the least a big apology", "There\u2019s a good chance she will change her mind on the dresses too, so wear whatever you want, get drunk, and don\u2019t to anything to help the bride. She has new bridesmaids for that.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I'd fucking bail on the entire wedding.", "I would blow the wedding off entirely. Don't go, don't help, don't worry about it anymore!", "I wouldn\u2019t wear the dress but I\u2019d also not help her any further in any way. No hair, no makeup etc- that\u2019s work that you\u2019d do as a bridesmaid or be paid for. As tempting as it is to be petty rise above it, because brides are cuckoo and why spoil someone else\u2019s wedding day - she wasn\u2019t spiteful just inconsiderate", "I would not go obviously she does not respect you to treat you that way", "Don't wear the dress that will just look like you are trying to be petty or passive aggressive unless she changes colors for her new bridesmaids.   It would not be wrong if you decided to sit this one out but talk to your partner about it first. \n\nDo not do her hair or makeup.   That was the deal when you were going to be a bridesmaid.  As a guest there is no reason for you to show up several hours early for someone that does not appreciate the effort that you have put in.  She can find someone else.  Stand firm", "If you're insisting on going despite all this, dye the dress and wear it. That way it's not her colour palette AND you didnt waste money on the dress. What colours it can go will depend on the colour it started but if all else fails, a little black dress works everywhere", "Contact her about the dress and ask if she's changing the colour scheme or if any of the new bridesmaids would like to buy it.\nWhat does she mean by not doing enough? When I've been bridesmaid I've been dress shopping with the bride and I've attended fayres but I've also only done the dress shopping with other brides. It's a ridiculous notion that you have to do more when she's getting her hair and make up done for free and you've agreed to stay sober so she can enjoy the night. I've never been to a wedding where this was a thing, usually by the night time people are more relaxed and if things don't go right no one really cares that much or is too drunk to deal with them.\n\nShe sounds like a horrible friend. I was bridesmaid for someone who once told me her other bridesmaid wouldn't be her friend after the wedding - then why is she the bridesmaid? Needless to say we are no longer friends either as she was narcissistic and spiteful, using people and dropping them when they have no use but also talking about her good friends behind their backs and mocking them. That's not someone I need in my life. You're better off without her.", "Withdraw all your support, reply and say unfortunately you are no longer available to do hair & makeup for the morning as you'll be needing to get yourself ready and definitely don't pick up any slack in the day if anyone asks you to do anything point them in the direction of the bride. As for the dress wearing it is a bit petty, either wear something you already have or get something from a charity shop so you don't have to spend more money. Probably best to sell the dress as you'll probably never wear it due to the negative memories surrounding it.", "NTA. Tell her in that case your hair and makeup services are no longer \u2018a bridesmaid\u2019s gift to the bride\u2019 and will therefore be charged at $XXX. \n\nAlso who says \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d care so much about my wedding\u201d?! She basically said \u201cI didn\u2019t care so just picked you guys\u201d. \n\nIf you do go, wear the damn dress!", "If this were simply between the bride and bridesmaids I\u2019d say rock the dress along with bridal-party quality hair, makeup, and nails. Someone won\u2019t be able to resist asking about your look and then you\u2019d be able to spill the tea on how the bride is a capital-Bee-yotch.\n\nHowever, this is your partner\u2019s lifelong best friend who\u2019s getting married, and I think that should be enough for you to rise above the situation and be the bigger person for the sake of the person you love. I would withdraw your hair/makeup/bride sitting services and attend as your partner\u2019s plus-one. Drink, dance, and send some sympathy the new bridesmaids\u2019 ways.\n\nIt\u2019s so tempting to suggest any number of petty things, but I think overall it\u2019s best to honor your partner\u2019s friendship with A rather than to get even with L.", "INFO: Is the color pallet known to ordinary guest? Like do they know not to wear this specific color? If they do I would avoid it, if not then it\u2019s entirely likely that other guests will wear the color as well so you could wear it. \n\nIf you want to avoid all potential drama then text her before that you plan to wear it. She\u2019ll likely shoot this idea down. This brings me to my next point: how important is that friendship for you? Because honestly, here is what I would do: if she doesn\u2019t want you to wear it then you should ask her to reimburse you. After this issue is settled with either you getting money or wearing it or you already deciding not to come, then you need to think if there is anything you would enjoy about the wedding. Do you have any reason to go besides supporting her? If you do, then you can still plan to go. But of course you won\u2019t do your tasks, not at all. You don\u2019t even have to inform her unless she brings it up because it goes without saying that ordinary guests don\u2019t have duties like you do. Furthermore, you should bring up since you are no longer in the wedding party, you won\u2019t arrive a day early and therefore can\u2019t do her hair. \n\nIf after all this you are a) still invited and b) still willing to go, then enjoy yourself at the wedding.", "I'm surprised you still want to go. She'll get pissed if you wear the dress though. I'd wear it. NTA", "I'm surprised you still want to go. She'll get pissed if you wear the dress though. I'd wear it.

Is that why being a bridesmaid was offered originally, because of your other services?", "Looks like she's removed all, if any, obligations regarding the wedding from you. Keep the dress but ditch the wedding. No one needs that kind of toxic attitude in their life.\n\nNot the AH but could be if you went to the wedding at all. Just my opinion. Best wishes!", "Yeah don't say anything and still wear it and make better choices in the future and don't be strong armed into buying something bon refundable. NTA", "Definitely don\u2019t be doing hair and make up or staying sober. \nCan you resell the dress and cop it on the chin? \n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t want to go.", "NTA  Are you sure she's even going with the same color of dress? I hope you're still not planning on doing the hair and makeup or helping at the wedding.", "I think you need to speak with the bride and see what she says. Her options are A: go for it or B: No, but I will pay you for the dress\u2026 any other answer means you are free to do what you like.", "Girl\u2026. Don\u2019t go", "Nta and I wouldn\u2019t be doing anything for the wedding anymore.", "I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re still planning on going to the wedding. \n\nI would message her and tell her that you already purchased the dress that she wanted, and that you\u2019ll be wearing it to the wedding unless she wants to refund you the money to buy a new one - ball is in her court then.", "Is the dress something you could wear elsewhere and you get something else for the wedding?\n\nAs you are no longer part of the wedding party, surely bride isn't still expecting you to do her hair and makeup???\n\n If hair and makeup is something you do for a job, charge her for your services. Otherwise, she can find someone else as you are too far away to practise.\n\nAs a wedding guest, eat drink and enjoy, someone in the wedding party can chase around after the bride.\n\nNTA, but you still have time to find something else to wear.", "I also don\u2019t get why you would have to pay for your bridesmaid dress. I\u2019m from Ireland and in general the couple pay for their bridesmaids dresses, hair, makeup etc. and most brides normally gift the jewellery they want to bridesmaids to wear the morning of the wedding. \n\nA lot of bridesmaids will offer to contribute to their dresses but it\u2019s not expected, the couple normally budget the dresses/suits as a wedding expense\u2026. it\u2019s probably why brides normally have 3/4 bridesmaids.", "NTA. You simply don't go. If she wants to treat you that way she isn't a real friend.", "Modify the dress if you can, don't do her hair & get steaming (happy) drunk at the reception.", "NTA If you still want to go to the wedding, wear the dress. You bought it for this occasion. And it\u2019s not like all the other bridesmaids are wearing the exact same colour or style, since you were free to choose a dress within the colour scheme.

If only she had fired you before you bought the dress! But, alas... \n\nFeel free to send her an itemized list of your expenses for the wedding up to this point.\n\nI suspect that from now on, your fiancee will want to associate with his best friend solo as it's hard to imagine being anything but NC with the bride.  Wow.\n\nNTA no matter what you decide to do about the dress.", "INFO- what is the color?\nNavy blue is not going to be unique among guests if the wedding is >40 people.
