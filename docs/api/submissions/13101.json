It\u2019s not acceptable that he didn\u2019t pay you for your service right away, and put you in a situation where you constantly have to remind him.

I try to be good about sending things right away, but if I've forgotten, that's on me and the Venmo request is a nice and very convenient reminder that I can easily action.  \n\nUnfortunately, I get the feeling this dude is trying to get out of paying you, so don't be surprised if he throws a stink as an effort to deflect from him trying to delay payment or as an excuse to allow him to look for someone he can more easily \"forget\" to pay.", "NTA You performed a service, and you should be paid for it.

Send the Venmo request and if he doesn't pay, refuse to babysit until he pays.", "NTA.

Laying things out up front about you and how you work, makes you looks professional and responsible. Most adults/parents will appreciate. Moving forward, even with existing families, say \u201cI\u2019ve found it best at the end of the night to Venmo request you for payment after I leave. I understand it can be the last thing on your mind after a night out so I want to make it easier on you! So when you get back and before I leave each night, I\u2019ll just confirm we are set on the right hours\u2026 also is there one parent or person who is best to receive the Venmo request? Or Do you prefer a different payment app? [sort out back end logistics up front] This way you will receive an instant notification and it will also alert you if not complete in the morning. Please let me know if you are ok with this.\u201d \n\nHere\u2019s the kicker. You MUST follow up on everything you\u2019ve laid forth. Seem organized and professional. You love their kids AND you are taking the mental business burden from them: make it look like a win win. Most people will appreciate being proactive. And most of the time (obvious exceptions for shitty people) they just get sidetracked and lost in the other BS of being a parent. Or they are drunk when they get home and hungover when they wake up!", "The lesson you learned here is \"men don't take hints\". You need to just straight up tell them. A venmo request would not be out of line at all.", "Nta. You deserve payment", "NTA girl. Forgetting a little bit isn\u2019t the worst thing ever, but he should\u2019ve paid you the moment you reminded him. \n\nAlso, per your update.. my mind says keep that second payment and pretend you thought it was a tip if you get asked lmaooo. But my heart says, having the mom also pay for the dads late fee isn\u2019t fair. Maybe tell the mom, and ask her if she\u2019d like her payment back?", "No reason he couldn\u2019t paid you before you left.", "Regarding your second update: you need to return the money. 1) it\u2019s theft to keep it.  2) eventually they\u2019ll realize you were double paid and either ask for it back or never hire you again.", "NTA. Send the wife her payment back. It will come up", "Nta, send the extra payment back to the mom though. If he was supposed to pay and he sent it to you late she technically covered him.", "You babysat for him. Pay the mom back.", "Like, as somebody who would never stiff a service worker on purpose but has problems remembering to do things, even if a babysitter was totally rude about it like \"where's my fuckin money, deadbeat,\" I'd be like \"Ah, I'm so sorry, NTA\"", "You mean venmo her before They leave! Pay first and you will have no frustration after.", "lmao hard same", "The Babysitters Club got a real gritty reboot."]}
