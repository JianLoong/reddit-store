The parents always pay me but the dad seems to be holding off paying me this time. He told me he would send me my money via Venmo as I was leaving and I told him that works and left it at that. The next morning, still nothing. So I texted the dad some info about something he was asking me about before I babysat as an excuse to text him and followed it with \u201cAlso, just a friendly Venmo reminder!\u201d He only responded with \u201cTy\u201d regarding the info I sent him and still hasn\u2019t paid me. I\u2019m starting to get frustrated because I need to buy my boyfriend\u2019s bday gift with that money and atp I\u2019m just thinking about sending a Venmo request with how much he owes me. I\u2019ve never done that In all 8 years of my babysitting but I\u2019m just so tired of parents not paying me on time and need the money. WIBTA?\n\n\n***UPDATE***: I texted the mom and she Venmoed me immediately! Thank you all for the quick advice. I\u2019ve been criticized my whole life so it\u2019s hard for me to stick up for myself.

I try to be good about sending things right away, but if I've forgotten, that's on me and the Venmo request is a nice and very convenient reminder that I can easily action.  \n\nUnfortunately, I get the feeling this dude is trying to get out of paying you, so don't be surprised if he throws a stink as an effort to deflect from him trying to delay payment or as an excuse to allow him to look for someone he can more easily \"forget\" to pay.", "NTA You performed a service, and you should be paid for it. If you were his hairdresser, he would pay you before leaving. If you were his mechanic, he wouldn't get his car back without paying. If you were a baker, no cake without cash.

Send the Venmo request and if he doesn't pay, refuse to babysit until he pays.", "NTA. You provided a service and he didn't pay for it.  \nA venmo request sounds like a reminder/invoice and that's what you'd get from any business in the same situation.", "No you wouldn't be. \n\nYou performed a service for which you were promised payment.
