I was at home with my 4 year old son when I got the call, and I was just panicking and everything felt like the worst timing. I know I needed to go to the hospital to see him, but the last thing I wanted was for my son to see him in this state. Usually I have a professional sitter or my husband's mom, but my sitter was at another job and grandma obviously would be at the hospital too. The only family I have in the area is my sister Sally and her fiance, who doesn't babysit but I was desperate, so I called. Sally said she was sorry, but doesn't know how to take care of him and they were planning to go out later anyway. I told her they can come to my house if they want, all his toys and things are here, but she said no. I tried calling a few friends, none of them were available. I again called Sally, and straight up begged her to take my son. I offered to pay for their dinner, give however much money they wanted, heck clean their kitchen for a month if I had to.\n\nI was able to leave my son with a friend after she came back from work. By the time I got to see my husband, he was already dead. It was the most painful feeling in my life, that I couldn't be there for his last moments.\n\nSally and her fiance are getting married in March. I agreed to make their wedding cake after Sally asked me earlier. I told them later that I couldn't make their wedding cake anymore because I don't have the time. Sally said I'd already agreed to make it and now I'm backtracking. I said I had time then, I don't have time now and anyway, her cake isn't really my problem. She has time to find a bakery or someone else to do it.\n\nShe got very upset and her fiance said wedding planning is stressful enough, and I'm making it even more difficult after I already said I'd make the cake. Sally uninvited me from the wedding and my parents, even a couple of other relatives who know what happened have been on my ass, saying I'm being petty and to just make the cake. I did say again, my son wasn't Sally's problem so her cake isn't mine. Mom said she understands I'm hurt, but I'm punishing Sally for my husband's death and acting like it's her fault he died.\n\nMy friends and others think I'm in the right. I do realize it's a bit petty but I don't have the energy to make an extravagant cake for Sally at this point.

Good to know.

Firstly I'm sorry for your loss\n\nSally 100% should have stepped up in your time of need.

Yes obviously no one plans an emergency, so I absolutely do not blame your for asking. But she said no, she couldn't do it last minute. Even then, you know she doesn't babysit so you should've expected a no. What would you have done if she didn't live nearby?

You don't mention if you're getting paid, but if you are then it's technically a customer agreement and you should be making it.\n\nAgain, if you said no immediately, like Sally did to babysitting (which again I don't agree with, she should've stepped up) then you'd be fine.

Unless you find out it is actually impossible.\n\nI honestly cannot think up a reason why you cannot make the wedding cake anymore, you still got half of December, the full January and February left to make it outside of you lost your willpower because Sally dissapointed you earlier. At which case because you already agreed to make it (that is a very important part), I think YtA if you now go back on it.\n\nThat said, now that you been uninvited I think you are in the clear of not making it anymore. But I still consider you to be in the wrong here.\n\nHopefully tried my best explaining this as best I could, it really is a situation where it sucks for everybody.", "Exactly what I came here to say. \nShe couldn't be there when you needed her on the most stressful day of your life, she can find someone else to make her cake and hopefully they charge her extra.", "I wish I could upvote this more than once.

I don't have kids and I don't know how to take care of them. But in a case like this I'd say yes in an instant.
