First of all, you doxxed the owner of a server for petty reasons which is super dangerous (probably why people don't talk to you tbh). Second of all, you seem insistent on trying to stick it to a group of people who want nothing to do with you clearly. Move on with your new friends. It's like they always say: \"The best revenge is a life well lived\"\n\nAdditionally, I don't think anyone will care that you are taking someone's spot at lunch, they will probably just sit somewhere else. All it will do is prove to them how petty you are.", "YTA. And I'm sure you already knew that.", "YTA. How old are you? I didn't do this crap even in kindergarten. If you feel up for this go ahead. But he and the other people in this group will probably come back at you even harder. And it won't be sitting on your seat. You will end up regretting this action.
