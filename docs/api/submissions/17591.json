I was sitting in the kitchen chatting with the adults while I assumed my son was playing outside with the other kids.\n\nMy niece gets home 20 minutes later, walks into the kitchen to say hi, and then goes upstairs to her room to drop off her backpack. Immediately I hear her start to scream all sorts of shit. Everyone kinda rushes upstairs to see her in her room holding a cut up pieces of fabric covered in paint.\n\nApparently my son snuck upstairs and decided to go through her stuff while she was gone and got into her art supplies and used them to mess with her cap and gown for graduation. My son's sitting there on the floor sobbing covered in paint while she screams at him and I had to physically push her away from him because she was taking it too far. I apologized profusely but it still wouldn't make her calmed down.\n\nShe kept going on and on about how graduation was in less than a week, I owed her 60 dollars for the 'shit my fucking brat ruined', that she wasn't going to be able to walk at graduation without the cap and gown, etc. I felt awful for her but I told her I couldn't afford to replace the clothing and there wasn't any point to it since it wouldn't deliver in time. I told her it'd be a good idea to see if anyone at her school had hand-me-downs from their older siblings.\n\nMy brother lost it and ended up kicking me and my son out. It's been a week and no one in the family has bothered to call me except to bitch at me. AITA?\n\nEdit: I'll reimburse my niece, I can't dip into the funds to renovate my house/fix the plumbing so I'll sell his Switch tomorrow, meaning he's going to be sobbing and making life hell for me.

You owe her a new gown, and you son owes her an apology because I only see you apologizing in this story.\n\nWhat is going on with your son that he did this in the first place?", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't watch YOUR kid and your negligence has caused irreparable damage to a cap and gown that's REQUIRED to be worn to be allowed to take the very earned walk across the stage. And your solution is for her to try to find some possibly dingy oversized or undersized hand me down from some random students sibling? THATS YOUR SOLUTION?!? Nah. Nope not a chance you need to find that money to get a replacement ordered and you better try to see if they offer express shipping and pay that too.\n\nYOU are the reason the gown was damaged. You did NOT supervise your son at all and your inability to watch your child resulted in damage not only to a expensive article of clothing it has also possibly kept this young woman from walking across the stage after what I'm assuming was 4yrs of hell at high school since she's right around the year where the pandemic damn near destroyed both junior and senior year for EVERYONE.\n\nPay. Up. Theirs no hand me downs available (no random student is gonna offer up a siblings gown. Many of us KEEP our town and cap for memories) and your negligence is what caused the damage. You should've watched your kid.\n\nAlso fyi she could easily come at you for the art supplies he destroyed too. But clearly she's not unless you add that information suddenly. So $60+ express shipping is the cheapest outcome. They'd have a small case for small claims court (I've seen some stupid cases) so apologizing ain't gonna do no good. You ain't gonna be able to raise your son if you dont pay up. Courts can be assholes, you get one harsh judge and you'll be working damn near 24/7 to pay everything back.\n\n(They can sue you for the cap and gown, any other items graduation required, legal fees, court fees etc. Small claims court let's you add a lot depending on the stage)\n\nAn apology and lackluster solution isn't gonna fix this. You need to pay up.", "YTA. \n\n\nHoly shit. What the fuck was going through your mind?", "Yes, YTA, and it\u2019s appalling you don\u2019t see it.  Your son is 7?  That\u2019s absolutely old enough to know that what he was doing was wrong.  What was he doing in her room?  You not only owe her an apology, and so does he, but you owe her the money.  Where is she going to get another cap and gown in time?  And discipline your son, for gods sake.", "YTA of course you should reimburse her for the cost of the dress, even if you need to make payments.", "YTA. You assumed your kid was outside playing? You\u2019re an asshole and a bad parent", "YTA. You should have been paying attention to your child and not allowing them to ruin things. You owe them $60.", "YTA.  Your son and his actions are YOUR responsibility.  Any financial loss he causes for others is YOUR responsibility.  The first words out of your mouth should have been \"I'm so sorry, I'll pay for it\".  \n\nYou don't owe her what she paid, but rather for a replacement AND whatever rush delivery fee is involved.  She deserves to own THE cap and THE gown she graduated in, not to borrow someone else's. \n\nKids can sneak away, I get that.  However, that doesn't relieve you of the responsibility for the damage he caused and it doesn't absolve you of the HUMAN NEED to make it right.  \n\nIf you wrecked into a parked car, would you say \"I can't afford to pay to fix it\" and drive off?  Because that's really not different from your son cutting up her gown.", "YTA- Pay up. You should have kept a better eye on your son.", "YTA\n\nYour son destroyed it, you are responsible for him, so you need to not only pay but do your utmost to make sure she gets the gown in time.\n\nEdit: Why didn't you call everyone for hand me downs or the place where she got it from and beg them/pay them for a quick delivery?", "YTA . Your kid ruined something special and the very MINIMUM you can do is pay to replace it.

Major asshole to down play it. She\u2019ll probably never forgive you", "Wth, of course YTA. A 7 yr old is not a toddler and knows they weren\u2019t supposed to do that. But given you don\u2019t seem able to accept responsibility for your kid\u2019s horrible actions it\u2019s no wonder he hasn\u2019t learned right from wrong.\n\nGive your niece the money asap and sign yourself up for parenting classes.", "YTA\n\nIt's clear from your responses that the reason your child doesn't have any respect for other people's things is because you don't either.  You're also a liar.  If you are \"saving up for upgrades around the house\", then you DO have the money.  You should be taking $60 from your savings to pay for this.  \n\nYou're horrifically selfish to think that your niece can \"just get over\" missing a major milestone because you didn't get to go to your graduation.  While your replies make it clear that your AH levels have reached the mass where they probably have their own gravitational pull, you should at least try to pull your head out of your own ass and take responsibility for your failure to supervise/parent your kid instead of telling people to \"just get over it\".\n\nI wouldn't expect family to \"just get over\" this.  Personally, I would be done with you and your poorly behaved child in my home after this.  If you can't be bothered to make good on your mistakes, don't be shocked if your family similarly can't be bothered to make an effort to be around you.", "YTA.

You should have been keeping an eye on him. Hell I can't imagine how long he was up there to be able to do that level damage.  \nYTA and a lousy aunt, and you're not setting any good example for your child either.\nApologize again, offer to do whatever it takes to make it right, payments, housework, make your son do chores (what he's capable of anyways) to show him that he (and you) messed up badly and need to make amends.  \nGo on FB or wherever and beg people for a replacement, admit why it's needed.  \nIt's her freaking HS graduation for crying out loud.\nIf you don't do that much, expect to not be welcome there again, and they'd be in the right for not welcoming you.", "Of course, YTA. \n\nCome on.", "YTA.  Your child is an extension of yourself and you need to pay up.", "Holy crap, yes, YTA.", "YTA.  Your kid = your responsibility.  Your kid ruined her things, you\u2019re responsible for paying it.

She is being robbed of a rite of passage that celebrates years of work.\n\nEven if you can\u2019t replace it, can help her out by putting in some effort to find a replacement.

I won't go so far as to suggest that you set this up for him to do so, that would be uncalled for and malicious, but we are seeing that you don't care about your niece having her moment.

This is one of the most important memories of your niece's life. And your child and you might have ruined it for her. Own up to it and replace the gown.
