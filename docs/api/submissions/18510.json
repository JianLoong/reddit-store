My adoption was rather sudden and my parents were on the older side when they took me in as were my siblings. This means there are a good ten years worth of photos and videos at my parents house that don't involve me as i wasn't around yet. I look a lot like my dad so many people believe I am biologically related to my family. This works for me as my bio parents are a touchy subject for me so I'd rather just let people believe that I was an accidental baby that my parents had later in life.Recently my brother, Jasons daughter was poking around photo albums at my parents house and found one dated 2001. My niece, Erica, noticed I was not there and asked where I was. As the topic of my adoption is usually avoided, Erica was unaware that I am not biologically related to her. Jason explained to Erica that I am adopted and that the photo was taken before I was around. A week later, I'm driving Erica home from a party and she begins to question me about my bio parents. This is more or less how that drive went. M = Me, E = Erica\n\nE: So dad told me you're adopted. Why didnt you tell me?\n\nM: Well E its not something i really like to talk about\n\nE: So if nan and pop arent youre real parents who are?\n\nM: As far as im concerned your grandparents are my real parents.\n\nE: But theyre not really\n\nM: Erica thats enough i dont want to talk about it.\n\nThere was more back and forth of her asking questions and me shutting her down until i lost my patience and yelled at her.\n\nM: Erica i mean it ive had enough, i don't want to hear another word from you the rest of this drive\n\nE: \\*nose exhale\\* its not like you can tell me what to do anymore youre not even my real uncle technically youre nothing to me\n\nI pulled the car over as I felt like I was going to throw up. We sat in silence for a bit until Erica broke it. She began to rub my arm and tell me she was just joking and ask me if I was okay. I collected my thoughts and told her to grab her shit and get out of my car. She started laughing but stopped when she saw my face and realised I was deadly serious. After some back and forth she reluctantly got out of my car. I drove away and called my brother. I told him I had dropped his daughter off a few blocks away from his home and he needed to go and collect her. I then turned my phone off until I woke up the next morning.My phone has been bombarded with texts from my Brother and SIL calling me an asshole for leaving a helpless girl alone on the street at night. I argued that she was close to home and wasn't in any real danger as Jason was going to pick her up instead, however my SIL said that as they had just recently moved homes she was still unfamiliar with her surroundings and got lost. My brother thinks that although I had a right to be upset I overreacted and am an asshole for putting his daughter in danger. My family all agree with him.\n\nSo AITA for abandoning my niece on the side of the road?", "created_utc": 1685408575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vc30a/aita_for_abandoning_my_16_year_old_niece_on_the/", "score": 995, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is unsafe.  Especially for a girl, at night. \n\nYou can pull over and say you won't move the car again until she drop the topic, then drive her straight home and explain the situation to her parents.  You can pull over and call her parents to come and meet you and pick her up.\n\nYou don't leave children alone on the side of the road, especially at night.  \n\nIt would have been reasonable for her to call 911 because you abandoned her, and you would have been in significant trouble.", "YTA\n\nJesus dude, you left a kid on the side of the road! What if something happened to her? I understand that adoption is a touchy subject with you, but fuck man. She's a teenager. They do stupid stuff. I don't care how you spin this, total asshole.", "YTA. She's an annoying teenager being an annoying teenager. You're an adult. If it was only a few more blocks, you should have driven her home and then explained in detail to her dad what was said and why you won't be chauffeuring her around anymore.\n\nHell, worst case scenario, make her walk the last few blocks, but maintain visual until she's at her home. But just up and leaving her there could have been very dangerous for both of you.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m a 52 year old adoptee. It was a closed adoption. I was legally my parent\u2019s daughter almost two months after I was born. I don\u2019t have any idea of who any bio-parents or siblings are, or what they look like.  \n\nYou and I have had different experiences with adoption. You don\u2019t disclose because it doesn\u2019t make you comfortable. Now, I don\u2019t disclose it most of the time IRL because it\u2019s something I don\u2019t think about much. It\u2019s just a part of my life story. \n\nYou can have a deep sensitivity to being adopted. What you can\u2019t do is to allow that to override your perception. You\u2019re almost ten years older. Your actions led to the possibility of real danger for her. \nShe could\u2019ve been harmed in so many horrific ways.", "ESH. As insensitive as she was to you, and she should know better at her age than to behave like this, you still accepted the responsibility of getting her home safely.", "YTA. You left a 16 year old girl alone in new and scary surroundings AFTER she realized she messed up and apologized. You're the adult, your brother and SIL trusted you with their daughter\u2019s safety considering you picked her up to drive her home from a party and you proved that trust was misplaced. Just think about how you would have felt if she ended up as a headline. She shouldn't have said what she did, but dropping her off in a relatively new location alone was irresponsible and could have gone very wrong", "YTA. At the end of the day you abandoned a kid on the side of the road. A rude, hurtful, nasty kid, but still a kid.", "ESH If it was just a bit away from the destination then why not take her there and refuse to drive her anywhere else until she apologizes?", "YTA. While I certainly understand your feelings, and even your desire to stop driving her home, you should have either waited for her father to arrive, or endured those last \"few blocks\" and then told her parents what she did. This was not an acceptable alternative.", "ESH - she was being an ass and you had every right to be upset. But you\u2019re the adult in the situation and you needed to either a) just drive the last few blocks to drop her off safely or b) wait and keep an eye on her until her dad could come get her from where you were. \n\nAlso, while it\u2019s completely understandable that this is a tough subject for you, and you\u2019re well within your rights to have boundaries around discussing it - I think it would be a good idea for you to see a therapist, preferably one who specializes in adoption.", "ESH\n\nI think you had a serious ethical and legal responsibility to get her the rest of the way home, or stay with her until your brother showed up. \n\nShe was being shitty, and there should be consequences for that. However you lose a lot of ground for getting apologies from people when you lash out at them, particularly if they are children.", "YTA \n\nYou had every right to be mad, but abandoning a 16 year old girl, at night, in an unfamiliar place was absolutely the wrong call on your part", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't leave a minor at night like that. Even if you're upset. Just drive her home, explain the situation to the parents and how badly she behaved.\n\nShe is an asshole too. A sixteen year old should absolutely know better. She kept touching a subject that was very sensitive to you, even though you asked multiple times of her to stop.\n\n\nYou should apologize to the parents (not the niece), and also the niece should apologize to you.", "You and your niece is an AH. You could have called her parents and waited instead of leaving her out in the dark all alone. This also tells me that you should never any children either. Why I say that you will endanger them over because they hurt your feels. Because you as an adult can't make better choices for a child/teenager. There are ways to handle this situation. As for the teenage. Her parents needs to handle her smartass comment before she ends up hurting someone. And ends up getting herself killed because she didn't handle her mouth properly.", "ESH. When you said that you didn\u2019t want to talk about it, she should have had enough respect to just stop.  You did put her in danger.  There was a mom in Missouri who let her daughter walk home after getting into an argument in the car and pulling over to let her out.  Mom figures it will be OK because it was close to their home.  Daughter never made it home.  You should have driven her home and talked to your brother about her keep bugging you to get details.", "Yes of course YTA! Your niece was inconsiderate and overstepped your boundaries despite your clear warnings. But she is a child and you endangered her because she upset you! If I was your brother I wouldnt entrust you with her safety again.", "YTA. Many young women haven't made that walk home. They were killed. You were pissed and deliberately put her life in danger. You supposedly the adult. Apparently, you are not an adult. Sixteen year olds say stupid shit. It's not okay but it's also zero reason to put her life at risk.", "YTA...you should have taken her to her house and just never driven her anywhere again.", "Wow, of course YTA. What if she was harmed while you had your little temper tantrum. If she really was that close, you should have been able to hold your emotions together and take her home. I would never trust you again with a loved one.", "YTA. You're a grown man, I'm sorry she hurt your feelings.", "You\u2019re old enough to know better than that. She shouldn\u2019t have acted that way, but she\u2019s also a child. Yta, and I think you know that.", "She was only a few blocks away from home.  \n\nHe warned her, told her that he didn't want to talk about it.\n\nShe wouldn't shut up \\[about it\\].\n\nThen, she just \\*had\\* to get that final little dig in.\n\nSome people just don't know when to STFU.\n\nI would have kicked her out too.  She was being insufferable.\n\nNTA OP.", "YTA Because I've read 3 posts that have the same thing in it. Uncle drops niece off close to home in a new area and gets in trouble with the family. The only thing different this time is the adoption.", "YTA big time. How could you leave a 16 year old in the middle of the road at night? Her parents trusted you to drive her home and her safety wasn\u2019t a priority for you at all.", "Good grief, when I was 16 I drove (alone) 200 miles to spend spring break with my cousin! His niece could walk a few blocks! She needs to learn to listen to people.", "NTA \nJust to clear something up.. all the Y T A people are saying that 16 yrs old are old enough to drive a car by themselves and have jobs but not old enough to take responsibility for saying hurtful things or walk a few blocks home? This world is ridiculous.", "NTA \"E\" told you that you can't tell her what to do as you are \"nothing to her\" You can't take those types of comments back.", "Yta. I\u2019ve actually been in her place before and it was traumatizing. I got into a fight with my mom in the car on the way home so she pulled into a neighborhood around a mile or two from our house, got out of the car and walked home leaving me alone in the car. I had no idea where she had pulled over at the time and she had taken my phone earlier in the day/week (I can\u2019t actually remember) so I couldn\u2019t call my dad. What I do remember was sitting in the car for what felt like hours, dealing with what I now know was either a severe autistic meltdown, severe panic attack, or a combination of the two. My dad eventually came to get me. I didn\u2019t even remember this incident as I suspect I just blocked it out until now. My experience happened in the middle of the day and I can\u2019t even imagine how much worse it would have been at night.", "YTA. \n\nYour triggers are your problem to manage.\n\nYou'd have been in your right to refuse to drive her anywhere ever again, but leaving her on the side of the road is absolutely unacceptable. \n\nWhat if something had happened to her?", "YTA for leaving your niece. Your niece is old enough to take no for an answer and was wrong to say your not her uncle. If you taken her home and talked to your brother about her behaviour and questions you would have been in the right 100%. You where wrong to leave her on the side of the road. Even if it was a few blocks from her house. Its unsafe for a young teenage girl like your niece.  In todays world you cant be leaving young girls or any young kids alone especially at night. Thankfully nothing happen to her but if something did would you be on reddit asking if YTA?", "It was a touchy subject. I get being mad. There are adopted people in my family, I do get it.\n\nBut there was one adult and one child in that car. Or, there was supposed to be. And you failed at being an adult. Drop her off, don\u2019t pick her up again. **But you don\u2019t leave a kid stranded, what on earth is wrong with you?**\n\nYTA", "i truly understand why people are calling you the asshole, and yeah ig you are. but at the same time i guess i'm just a little harsher than most about teaching kids life lessons. shit happens when you're a bad person. kids need to learn that. she said you're nothing to her, so some random teen girl shouldn't be in your car \ud83d\udc69\u200d\u2696\ufe0f", "At least she learnt an important concept: don't piss off people  doing u favours", "Lol all these precious people....\n\nNTA.

Bad move to leave her there, but also she got a great lesson in fucking around and finding out.", "As an adoptee who can understand how triggered you were, I was going to say NTA. But after reading some of the other comments I have to go with YTA. Just because you have unresolved trauma doesn't mean you get to put your niece in a dangerous situation. Please think about going to therapy, it really does help.", "Esh. You don't abandon a minor. You should've just told her to get out and called your brother while you waited.  Your niece is way too old.  You said so, and she should've done that.  She gave fafo'd. She needs to learn not to push people to their limit.", "NTA.

I hate the \"you're the adult in this situation\" bullshit. What about you?  You don't stop having feelings after you turn a certain age. You should also matter, no matter your age. \n\nIt doesn't take a genius to realize that adoption for many people can be a sensitive subject. She's 16, not 12, and your 25 not 35. You are still young yourself.

She shouldn't have kept pushing the issue and saying you're not her 'real' uncle is horrible (but honestly reflects directly on her parents, who should have explained to her years ago that genetics does not define a family), but she is a child.

I completely understand that OP\u2019s actions were definitely not okay to just abandon the niece like that, but some people are acting like it was unprovoked or that OP should\u2019ve swallowed their feelings like it was nothing\u2026 and I just think it\u2019s insane to pretend the niece wasn\u2019t being awful.", "That's not mouthy, that bullying and horrible. OP doesn't deserve that bullshit.\n\nI understand there is a myriad of ways that you can be hurt being alone. However triggering someone, not apologising and being a general tool is a good way to make people not particularly care about your wellbeing\n\nShe's an ass\n\nHe should've taken her home as you say because it can be unsafe for anyone, but fuck it don't give people a reason to not care", "she did not apologize. she said she was kidding, unless i misread. if he\u2019s not her real uncle and means nothing to him, than it shouldn\u2019t be his problem when she\u2019s dropped off on the side of the road. play a stupid game and win a stupid prize.", "Did you miss the point where she was at a **party**? She most likely had something to drink.\n\nAre... are you suggesting that it's better and more responsible to let her drive drunk?", "Bullshit.  He's clearly not responsible. Why are you okay with a teen girl being placed in an unsafe situation? So being a snit nosed kid deserves rape? Because that can happen.", "Under 18 is a legally child.", "I would literally be such an awful mom if I let my children ignore other people\u2019s boundaries like people here are thinking op should just let niece do. Insanity. My 6 year old understands no means no", "I guess it\u2019s unclear on whether or not she actually said I\u2019m sorry but she was asking if OP was okay and trying to comfort him. \nAnd that\u2019s just not how it works. I get that she said fucked up things but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just abandon a teenage girl on the side of the road at night. OP could have done a million other things. Obviously she deserved some sort of repercussion, but something dangerous is not fitting", "Drinking isn\u2019t an excuse and I\u2019m sick of people acting like it is. Unless someone forced the alcohol down your throat, you made a choice. Actions have consequences, this isn\u2019t a hard concept.", "yeah, asked if he was okay after the long silence when he was visibly upset, over something that should of never happened in the first place. she was close enough to home and family was made aware that OP would not be taking her any further. not to mention that she also has a phone to remain in contact with her parents. i realize i never actually typed my verdict, so in case it wasn\u2019t already obvious enough, NTA. and this is coming from a teenager very close in age to the niece.", "Yes, it's not an excuse to be an asshole.\n\nHowever, alcohol does blur the thinking process by **a lot**.\n\nAnd to leave a (allegedly) **drunk teen** on the side of the road is not only stupid, but dangerous.", "I guess but since they were already so close why not drop her at home and find a different solution or refuse to speak to/drive her anymore. If something had happened they would have felt awful", "fortunately, that \u201cif\u201d did not happen, so it\u2019s irrelevant in this scenario. and it\u2019s reasonable to not want to continue a drive with someone who basically called you not family when you\u2019re doing them a favor. she\u2019s almost an adult and she learned a much needed lesson, even if you think it\u2019s harsh."]}
