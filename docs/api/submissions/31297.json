My sister and brother-in-law (BIL) are my only family. I\u2019m very close with them because they took me in after my mom passed away during high school. I\u2019m living with them while I\u2019m getting settled after law school and have helped raise their two children, one of them my nephew whose 8 years old. I still help every day with the kids. My nephew has a learning disability and is prone to tantrums but is otherwise extremely social and has no cognitive issues (why this is even relevant i\u2019ll explain).\n\nSo I revealed to my family that I have a boyfriend 1 year ago. They were excited for me and to meet him! But when I suggested he come for the holidays, they said they\u2019d need to meet him first separate from the kids because my nephew could \u201cget confused\u201d. I disagreed but still tried to schedule a lunch with them under the assumption after they meet him first, they\u2019ll loosen up. \n\nBut their schedules never worked where someone else can watch the kids while they meet my boyfriend. Months passed and meeting separately became requiring that if the kids are around he is \u2018just a friend\u2019.\n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s family had no such problems. I\u2019ve seen them five times in the past year, including Easter. I\u2019ve been around their family, young and old, without needing to hide who we are. \n\nSo now a year has passed and I\u2019ve again proposed meeting my boyfriend, but this time for Christmas instead of a separate meeting. We had an argument because, in BIL\u2019s words, \u201cwe\u2019re fine with meeting him but you\u2019re stuck in your way and don\u2019t want to compromise. You insist on doing it your way. You want to enforce your view on your nephew when we are the parents and we decide how he learns about that stuff.\u201d\n\nThis made me very, **very** angry. But I stayed calm (was shaking a lot) and said this isn\u2019t something I feel should be compromised. There\u2019s nothing confusing about having a boyfriend. I\u2019ve met his family five times including his nieces and he hasn\u2019t meet my family once. \n\nMy sister chimes in that she understands I want to be myself but that my nephew will get confused because he\u2019s too young and because \u201cof how he is\u201d. She\u2019s referencing the learning disability and the tantrums. I say that there are plenty of kids with disabilities who learn about being gay and have no problem. And plenty of kids regardless who are his age and younger that know gay people exist.\n\nThe argument kept going and in the end BIL had a \u201cgreat idea\u201d to get a third opinion from my nephew\u2019s principal, who is gay and has a \u2018partner\u2019. I said they can do that if it makes them feel better but it doesn\u2019t change that there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a boyfriend. And that if he gets \u201cconfused\u201d anyway that they need to make the effort of parenting their kid and explaining it just like anything else.

If that's not the case here, then your sister and BIL are making up silly concerns. If it is the case, then you have a more serious problem.\n\nI can't imagine living with people who hate what I am. Please do your best to escape. Many gay people end up with \"logical families\" that they choose because their \"biological families\" won't accept them. I'm sorry.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not necessarily saying to cut all ties, if they can be polite and respectful.

Period. The fact that they are making such a big deal about this when you are obviously openly gay is a little disconcerting. The fact that they say you are \"stuck\" in your way is disconcerting. I get that some people don't want their children to learn about sex at a certain age but this has nothing to do with that. IMHO it's following the whole suppression of the existence to LGBTQ people that seems to be sweeping some parts of our society. Is it possible that's what happening with your BIL and sister? Can you bring that up gently and diplomatically?\n\nPersonal note: I have a lot of gay friends and family members. When one of my sons was about 8 he came home from school and asked me what gay was. It was the 80s and that was a big insult for kids in his school milieu. As was f\\*\\*\\*\\*t. He had been called both at school. I explained that the words had changed from their original meaning and gay used to mean happy, carefree and fun-loving. Now it means when a person falls in love with someone of the same sex.

I'm sorry that youronky family's only interest us in using you as free child care.\n\nHaving said all that, introducing your bf as your friend is a way to ease young kids into a new relationship. Parents who are single do it all the time. I think that same sex couples are more sensitive to this because they have been forced to hide their relationship. \n\nIf I were you, I'd agree to be introduced as friends and keep PDAs at a minimum to start.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal for now but when the boy gets about 10 years old he will question his company at some point. \n\n\nThe homo thing tho i get what the parents say. Its not because I\u2019m homophobic. But when a child is \u201cconfused\u201d at such a young age i would wait a bit longer to explain those things. Just because how older you get, how different you see things like these. Yes plenty of kids can know about it but i have a 6 year old sister and she is thinking which colour the sun should be on her drawings like\u2026 But still when the kid comes by herself asking questions i would simply answer them. \n\n\n\nGood luck tho!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they want to argue that perspective with you, they better be able to show you what scientific/medical/or psychology journal or professional they have confirmed this with.\n2. It's fine for parents to want to meet someone before introducing them to their kids, but if they want to keep having a relationship with you, they better figure out a way to make that happen soon. They have already blown off an entire year.\n3. That everything they are doing is telling you they do not accept you for who you are and for who you love. And it is breaking your heart.", "NTA.

Maybe it's time to move out and away.  \n\nNTA", "They are homophobic. It's one thing to say that they want to easy your boyfriend in slowly if you've only been together a little while and want to be sure this is going to be a steady relationship (which they did not say at all). But they have avoided meeting him and now they are using their son to continue to avoid meeting him. I'm sorry, but even though they took you in and you've been close, they are homophobic as fuck.

Your sister and her husband have the problem and think if they keep putting it off, you'll stop asking. \n\nThey don't like, \"that stuff.\" But you're completely deserving of having your relationship and your life be visible.

Having a disability doesn\u2019t mean you are stupid, easily influenced, will get confused, etc.! I know because I\u2019m autistic! And I experienced comments like that by my family as well! We\u2019re actually smart people but also misunderstood as well. If your nephew understands that boys can have girlfriends, then he should know that it\u2019s perfectly ok to be in a relationship with the same gender! And I\u2019m very worried your BIL and sister will control your nephew\u2019s beliefs as he gets older and no parent should ever force a child to believe something that they disagree with! I\u2019d suggest you\u2019d get away from that homophobic family OP. They clearly won\u2019t change their ways..It\u2019ll probably be hard to accept at first but you don\u2019t need that negativity in your life that\u2019ll cause you more stress. There will be more accepting people that\u2019ll love you and your boyfriend just the way you are! And your boyfriend sounds like a great guy btw! Again, please get away from your BIL and sister.

I think homophobia is wrong and introducing a 8 year old kid to the fact that gay people exist isnt wrong. \n\nBut heterosexuality is litterally the base sexuality. It's how you were made.
