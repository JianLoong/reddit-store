My sister and brother-in-law (BIL) are my only family. I\u2019m very close with them because they took me in after my mom passed away during high school. I\u2019m living with them while I\u2019m getting settled after law school and have helped raise their two children, one of them my nephew whose 8 years old. I still help every day with the kids. My nephew has a learning disability and is prone to tantrums but is otherwise extremely social and has no cognitive issues (why this is even relevant i\u2019ll explain).\n\nSo I revealed to my family that I have a boyfriend 1 year ago. They were excited for me and to meet him! But when I suggested he come for the holidays, they said they\u2019d need to meet him first separate from the kids because my nephew could \u201cget confused\u201d. I disagreed but still tried to schedule a lunch with them under the assumption after they meet him first, they\u2019ll loosen up. \n\nBut their schedules never worked where someone else can watch the kids while they meet my boyfriend. Months passed and meeting separately became requiring that if the kids are around he is \u2018just a friend\u2019.\n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s family had no such problems. I\u2019ve seen them five times in the past year, including Easter. I\u2019ve been around their family, young and old, without needing to hide who we are. \n\nSo now a year has passed and I\u2019ve again proposed meeting my boyfriend, but this time for Christmas instead of a separate meeting. We had an argument because, in BIL\u2019s words, \u201cwe\u2019re fine with meeting him but you\u2019re stuck in your way and don\u2019t want to compromise. You insist on doing it your way. You want to enforce your view on your nephew when we are the parents and we decide how he learns about that stuff.\u201d\n\nThis made me very, **very** angry. But I stayed calm (was shaking a lot) and said this isn\u2019t something I feel should be compromised. There\u2019s nothing confusing about having a boyfriend. I\u2019ve met his family five times including his nieces and he hasn\u2019t meet my family once. \n\nMy sister chimes in that she understands I want to be myself but that my nephew will get confused because he\u2019s too young and because \u201cof how he is\u201d. She\u2019s referencing the learning disability and the tantrums. I say that there are plenty of kids with disabilities who learn about being gay and have no problem. And plenty of kids regardless who are his age and younger that know gay people exist.\n\nThe argument kept going and in the end BIL had a \u201cgreat idea\u201d to get a third opinion from my nephew\u2019s principal, who is gay and has a \u2018partner\u2019. I said they can do that if it makes them feel better but it doesn\u2019t change that there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a boyfriend. And that if he gets \u201cconfused\u201d anyway that they need to make the effort of parenting their kid and explaining it just like anything else. This offended them.\n\nSo to sum up AITA for refusing to portray my boyfriend as just a friend around my nephew?", "created_utc": 1700414211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17z1w3m/aita_for_refusing_to_introduce_my_boyfriend_to_my/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is confusing about two adults in a relationship? It will only confuse the child if **the child has been taught that it's wrong**. If that's not the case here, then your sister and BIL are making up silly concerns. If it is the case, then you have a more serious problem.\n\nI can't imagine living with people who hate what I am. Please do your best to escape. Many gay people end up with \"logical families\" that they choose because their \"biological families\" won't accept them. I'm sorry.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not necessarily saying to cut all ties, if they can be polite and respectful. But as long as they reject who you are, by asking you to pretend that your boyfriend isn't your boyfriend, then I can't imagine continuing to live with them.", "NTA. Your family is making it clear what they think of you, your identity, and your boyfriend.\n\nDo what you want and don't feel bad for them being jerks. I'm glad your bf's family is welcoming.\n\nAnyways this conversation would never have happened if you were dating a woman, which is why it's fucked up.\n\nLearning disabilities do not mean a child is incapable of understanding, \"this is Ryan! He's my boyfriend and makes me smile so big!

They obviously either don't give their son enough credit or deep down they're really uncomfortable with the idea of being gay and having a partner. My 7 year old grandson has a girlfriend. I had a boyfriend in first grade. The term means something completely different to kids as it does to say  teenagers or adults. It's just someone they like a lot, better than most of the others. Period. The fact that they are making such a big deal about this when you are obviously openly gay is a little disconcerting. The fact that they say you are \"stuck\" in your way is disconcerting. I get that some people don't want their children to learn about sex at a certain age but this has nothing to do with that. IMHO it's following the whole suppression of the existence to LGBTQ people that seems to be sweeping some parts of our society. Is it possible that's what happening with your BIL and sister? Can you bring that up gently and diplomatically?\n\nPersonal note: I have a lot of gay friends and family members. When one of my sons was about 8 he came home from school and asked me what gay was. It was the 80s and that was a big insult for kids in his school milieu. As was f\\*\\*\\*\\*t. He had been called both at school. I explained that the words had changed from their original meaning and gay used to mean happy, carefree and fun-loving. Now it means when a person falls in love with someone of the same sex.

In reality the younger he is the less confused he'll be if this is a new concept to him.

Your sister and BIL do not want your boyfriend in their lives. You've given so much to them and their kids.  You're good enough to care for their children but not good enough to be respected as an adult with a partner.\n\nAsk them if they'll be more comfortable if your bf dresses as a woman.  Then you won't be corrupting their kids with your dirty \"lifestyle.\"\n\nYour sister and BIL have had a year to find a time to meet your bf.  They are actively NOT meeting him.  I'm sorry that youronky family's only interest us in using you as free child care.\n\nHaving said all that, introducing your bf as your friend is a way to ease young kids into a new relationship. Parents who are single do it all the time. I think that same sex couples are more sensitive to this because they have been forced to hide their relationship. \n\nIf I were you, I'd agree to be introduced as friends and keep PDAs at a minimum to start. This is not to coddle your sis and BIL but to keep your relationship with your nibblings.

You like penis.  Men make your penis hard. Nothing confusing about that. How exactly would them meeting him without the kids present help with the supposed co confusion?  \n\nI\u2019m not one of those social media activists that throws names & accusations around. This is homophobia though my boy. The funny part about homophobia is that it\u2019s really easy to compartmentalize.

You shouldn\u2019t force that on your nephew; especially since the the parents already told you they don\u2019t want that (as most people wouldn\u2019t).", "Idk? I get your side but your nephew is 8 years old? And also its better for your nephew to first see him as your friend and later on tell him that he is your boyfriend! So that he could get used to the new company. At some point though your sister needs to accept that the nephew needs to know that the \u201cfriend\u201d who is coming over is the boyfriend. I would have just swallowed my pride and at least introduced your boyfriend to your sister and BIL as your boyfriend. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal for now but when the boy gets about 10 years old he will question his company at some point. \n\n\nThe homo thing tho i get what the parents say. Its not because I\u2019m homophobic. But when a child is \u201cconfused\u201d at such a young age i would wait a bit longer to explain those things. Just because how older you get, how different you see things like these. Yes plenty of kids can know about it but i have a 6 year old sister and she is thinking which colour the sun should be on her drawings like\u2026 But still when the kid comes by herself asking questions i would simply answer them. \n\n\n\nGood luck tho!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
