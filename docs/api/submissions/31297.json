My sister and brother-in-law (BIL) are my only family. I\u2019m very close with them because they took me in after my mom passed away during high school. I\u2019m living with them while I\u2019m getting settled after law school and have helped raise their two children, one of them my nephew whose 8 years old. I still help every day with the kids. My nephew has a learning disability and is prone to tantrums but is otherwise extremely social and has no cognitive issues (why this is even relevant i\u2019ll explain).\n\nSo I revealed to my family that I have a boyfriend 1 year ago. They were excited for me and to meet him! But when I suggested he come for the holidays, they said they\u2019d need to meet him first separate from the kids because my nephew could \u201cget confused\u201d. I disagreed but still tried to schedule a lunch with them under the assumption after they meet him first, they\u2019ll loosen up. \n\nBut their schedules never worked where someone else can watch the kids while they meet my boyfriend. Months passed and meeting separately became requiring that if the kids are around he is \u2018just a friend\u2019.\n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s family had no such problems. I\u2019ve seen them five times in the past year, including Easter. I\u2019ve been around their family, young and old, without needing to hide who we are. \n\nSo now a year has passed and I\u2019ve again proposed meeting my boyfriend, but this time for Christmas instead of a separate meeting. We had an argument because, in BIL\u2019s words, \u201cwe\u2019re fine with meeting him but you\u2019re stuck in your way and don\u2019t want to compromise. You insist on doing it your way. You want to enforce your view on your nephew when we are the parents and we decide how he learns about that stuff.\u201d\n\nThis made me very, **very** angry. But I stayed calm (was shaking a lot) and said this isn\u2019t something I feel should be compromised. There\u2019s nothing confusing about having a boyfriend. I\u2019ve met his family five times including his nieces and he hasn\u2019t meet my family once. \n\nMy sister chimes in that she understands I want to be myself but that my nephew will get confused because he\u2019s too young and because \u201cof how he is\u201d. She\u2019s referencing the learning disability and the tantrums. I say that there are plenty of kids with disabilities who learn about being gay and have no problem. And plenty of kids regardless who are his age and younger that know gay people exist.\n\nThe argument kept going and in the end BIL had a \u201cgreat idea\u201d to get a third opinion from my nephew\u2019s principal, who is gay and has a \u2018partner\u2019. I said they can do that if it makes them feel better but it doesn\u2019t change that there\u2019s nothing wrong with having a boyfriend. And that if he gets \u201cconfused\u201d anyway that they need to make the effort of parenting their kid and explaining it just like anything else.

If that's not the case here, then your sister and BIL are making up silly concerns. If it is the case, then you have a more serious problem.\n\nI can't imagine living with people who hate what I am. Please do your best to escape. Many gay people end up with \"logical families\" that they choose because their \"biological families\" won't accept them. I'm sorry.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not necessarily saying to cut all ties, if they can be polite and respectful.

Period. The fact that they are making such a big deal about this when you are obviously openly gay is a little disconcerting. The fact that they say you are \"stuck\" in your way is disconcerting. I get that some people don't want their children to learn about sex at a certain age but this has nothing to do with that. IMHO it's following the whole suppression of the existence to LGBTQ people that seems to be sweeping some parts of our society. Is it possible that's what happening with your BIL and sister? Can you bring that up gently and diplomatically?\n\nPersonal note: I have a lot of gay friends and family members. When one of my sons was about 8 he came home from school and asked me what gay was. It was the 80s and that was a big insult for kids in his school milieu. As was f\\*\\*\\*\\*t. He had been called both at school. I explained that the words had changed from their original meaning and gay used to mean happy, carefree and fun-loving. Now it means when a person falls in love with someone of the same sex.

I'm sorry that youronky family's only interest us in using you as free child care.\n\nHaving said all that, introducing your bf as your friend is a way to ease young kids into a new relationship. Parents who are single do it all the time. I think that same sex couples are more sensitive to this because they have been forced to hide their relationship. \n\nIf I were you, I'd agree to be introduced as friends and keep PDAs at a minimum to start.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal for now but when the boy gets about 10 years old he will question his company at some point. \n\n\nThe homo thing tho i get what the parents say. Its not because I\u2019m homophobic. But when a child is \u201cconfused\u201d at such a young age i would wait a bit longer to explain those things. Just because how older you get, how different you see things like these. Yes plenty of kids can know about it but i have a 6 year old sister and she is thinking which colour the sun should be on her drawings like\u2026 But still when the kid comes by herself asking questions i would simply answer them. \n\n\n\nGood luck tho!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The single most confusing concept on the planet, apparently.", "I\u2019ve asked this many times and they give a different answer each time. \n\nThat he\u2019s too young to understand what being gay is, that he already confuses words (he\u2019ll sometimes call me his \u201cbrother\u201d or say BIL is my sister\u2019s \u201cwife\u201d) so learning I have a boyfriend will confuse him more, etc. During the argument BIL said being gay is not \u201cthe norm\u201d so he\u2019ll go to school and might say the wrong thing to someone. This last answer is part of why I got so angry. \n\nAs to how sheltered he is, he\u2019s asked me in the past if I have a girlfriend or if I\u2019m going to get married and have kids. I answer \u201cnot a girlfriend\u201d and \u201cmaybe one day\u201d.
