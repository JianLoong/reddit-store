You're a family with a child and it's never too late to address the issue and other issues you might have. I'd say don't neglect it because finance are important and it's not that you have a financial difficulty it sounds like the only difficult thing is not being able to make mutual agreements.

Obviously not a scenario either.\n\nMarriages are supposed to be partnerships, and that was actually the issue with the men in your family (I come from a mid east/Asian background so I'm familiar with heavy patriarchal societies), that the men held the purse and dictated how that money would be used.\n\nThe solution there is that neither party holds the purse and both decide on how the money should be used. Joint decision.\n\nYou sort of did that but somehow added some weird notion that the wife should not contribute to the purse at all? A great deal for your wife I guess but this isn't healthy for a relationship - and maybe the biggest sign of the unhealthiness of it all is that maybe one of the few times you've asked her to pitch in led to an argument.\n\nYou're nta - but....

Yeah, it\u2019s like I said: She\u2019s taking advantage of you. This is not an equal relationship in any way. You are doing way more than her. She should be doing most of the chores and home care and covering a % of the costs that is fair with the money she is bringing in. She\u2019s not working full time so she needs to be making that up. The financial abuse has bled over into other aspects of the relationship.", "That's good - sounds like necessities and day-to-day things are either roughly equal, or slightly skewed with your contribution being greater. \n\nSo for a vacation on top of those needs, asking her to contribute too is definitely fair. Her getting angry and giving you the silent treatment over a reasonable request is not an okay response at all.

She can't have it both ways where she wants the family to go to Disney but she isn't willing to help contribute. Doesn't sound like she's being much of a partner there; to be blunt, I think she's being very selfish and it's entirely unacceptable for her to be giving you some silent treatment crap over this.\n\n...stream of consciousness here, I just reread and realized you two have roughly the same amount of money in the bank. Doubling down now on how much of an asshole that makes her - expecting you to foot all the bills while she occasionally buys groceries and gas.

I\u2019m glad you can identify with my circumstance. Thank you for the insight and I hope well for your family too.", "I really don\u2019t care to fraction it out or graph our finances, to be honest. It\u2019s sappy, but I just cared about the heart of it all. Regardless of ideals or romantic feelings, we have an issue that I\u2019ll need to address.", "I prefer golden goose \ud83d\ude1b", "You\u2019re probably right.", "If his money is their money, shouldn't her money *also* be their money? And also, if he's supposed to pay her the going rate for childcare and housekeeping, she should be paying him the going rate for whatever childcare and housekeeping he does. She's not a SAHM; she works part-time and earns her own income. If they're going to share finances, they should *both* share. If they're going to have separate finances and a transactional financial relationship, it should go both ways. OP's situation sounds very lopsidedly one-way.", "Goofy ahh take", "So you have a little left at the end of the month to put into savings while working full time. She has casual spending money and a little to put into savings even though she only works part time. You sir are being taken advantage of.", "You are definitely right that I helped flip things to the opposite extreme. It was never my intention to uno-reverse things. I think I did it reactively because of my upbringing.\n\nOften when we argue I try to remind her that we are a team and not competitors. She has lone wolf tendencies that are hard to break through.", "I don\u2019t know where this idea was derived from, but just to clarify, we each gave what we could for the down payment. I did put down more, but none of that matters in light of our current situation.", "She is a loving mom. In our cores, we get along very well. I see a lot of death in my profession and one time I saw a young man die while his wife mourned over him. My wife and I were newlyweds back then and we\u2019re fighting over stupid things like chores. After that incident, I told myself I would not sweat the stupid stuff anymore. I think that\u2019s why I don\u2019t pressure her much anymore.", "When I was younger and newly married, I used to subscribe to that notion. I never thought that things had to be an equal 50/50, but that each had to put in a fair effort. In my line of work I see a lot of death and after seeing a young man die that was newly married like me, I changed my way of thinking. I don\u2019t care to carry a score card anymore. It doesn\u2019t help to micromanage. I just want a happy family and that\u2019s it.", "You have great insight. She has never been diagnosed, but I believe my wife has been struggling with untreated depression for most of her life. When I first met her she recently got out of an extremely abusive relationship. She also has very few friends and is not close to anyone in her immediate family.\n\nEven after over a decade of being together, I still struggle to find an angle to encourage her to seek help. Most of the free moments she has in spent getting that dopamine fix on her phone.", "Was cheaper back in the day but it's never been cheap", "Why are you so fucking hostile?\n\nI was literally trying to make sense of their finances because I didn't see how two people who made almost the same amount for most of their relationship, with one person paying everything and one person paying nothing, would have equal savings. When OP said their savings evened out after buying the house, I thought that meant a lot of the money she hadn't spent/had saved had gone toward the house. Turns out he worked longer than she did.", "Well now you\u2019re seeing the result of what happens when you try to carry all the load. It\u2019s not enough for you to just want a happy family.\n\nInstead of thinking about it as a true \u201c50/50\u201d think of it as 100/100. You give 100% and she gives 100%. Do you really think she\u2019s giving 100% when she is giving you the silent treatment after being asked to pay less than 15% of this vacation? Do you really think she\u2019s giving 100% when she\u2019s busy on Amazon while you\u2019re working a full time job and doing the housework and chores?\n\nI think you need to realize this is a much deeper problem than just needing her to cover \u201cfair\u201d costs. It\u2019s clear that she doesn\u2019t respect what you do for this family. And she doesn\u2019t respect you as a man or as a husband.", "Maybe try to find a therapist you can go to and if you find someone you trust and feel is good and being open with her about that it will encourage her, maybe she will agree join you if it's a couples therapist. Leading by example is what I find the best way to change anything in a relationship", "Thank you for the advice. I would say I\u2019m definitely more of the calculating type of the two of us, but something tangible does paint a better picture.", "How am I hostile LMAO? It literally says he paid 3/4 and her 1/4 and you jump in with so she put more down. So I genuinely figured your reading or comprehension is off since you seem to not understand what's written.", "He posted that after I posted with my (incorrect) assumption that she'd put down more for the down payment...", "Ok. I accept your apology. Have a great night."]}
