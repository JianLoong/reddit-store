The trip was my idea, but when running through the plans with my wife she was clearly excited about going on this trip. The expenses started adding up to over $3000, which was getting over my comfort level. One of the plans was to go to a local theme park, but the cost would be adding an extra $500. The family wanted to go, but I was hesitant while looking up the prices. I asked my wife what she wanted to do and she said we should do it. I asked her if she would be willing to pay for the theme park tickets since I was paying for everything else. She then got upset and didn\u2019t talk to me the rest of the night. \n\nSince we started living together about 10 years ago, I have always paid for all the bills (rent, cars, insurance, utilities, most of the groceries\u2026). My wife moved into my apartment back then and everything was already set to my name so it was easier to keep it that way. \n\nWe are in the same profession, but I do make slightly more money than her. I never really minded paying more because if we were ever in a jam, I know she\u2019d help out. We have always had separate bank accounts. Early in our marriage, I tried to make a third joint account for us, but she got frustrated with the application process and didn\u2019t want to do it anymore.\n\nWe are fortunate enough to have a child and house now. Since having our kid she started to work part time. She roughly makes about 1/3 of what she used to. We have around the same amount of money in our respective bank accounts. I still pay all the bills from my account and all of the vacations so far as well, but I do work full time. I guess I\u2019m just getting tired of carrying all the financial burden. I thought maybe I should start asking her to contribute a little too. I didn\u2019t think her paying for the amusement park tickets was too unreasonable.

You\u2019ve created this terrible dynamic and she\u2019s literally financially abusing you. The fact you apologized for something that isn\u2019t even close to fair still shows how much of a doormat you are.

I\u2019m not against the idea of her working more, it just needs to fit into our family work life balance. \n\nBefore moving in with me, she lived with her parents and never really had to budget for anything or pay the bills. I should have addressed this long ago, but instead just went with it.", "Good point on the percentages.  Since she makes roughly 1/3 what he does, she should pay about that much.\n\nBut him asking her to pay 1/6 of the cost is therefore more than reasonable.  Her response is definite AH territory.   They may need marriage counseling to work through that though.", "You got the general idea right. I\u2019m using ballpark figures to keep it simple, but after all the bills, I save a little less than her. In my family, the men dominated the money leaving their wives very resentful. When I realized this, I wanted to be the opposite. I guess I\u2019ve been too idealistic.

But I guess not that extremely expensive she is doing her share in all the cost.   \nSo you are definitely not the asshole, and maybe let her share more in the costs.", "I understand, sometimes we just push things aside until they become major issues. You're a family with a child and it's never too late to address the issue and other issues you might have. I'd say don't neglect it because finance are important and it's not that you have a financial difficulty it sounds like the only difficult thing is not being able to make mutual agreements. Might be a good idea to find a recommendation for a couple therapist or any therapist you trust and go by yourself and really go over those situations  thoroughly and get an advice on how to find a better way to approach her", "I agree", "I may be wrong about the nest egg. The opportunity is there, though. My main point is that after all obligatory bills are paid, you're both left with that same \u2153 in disposable income. Fun stuff and anything over and above should be split, not have an expectation that you'll cover all the family extras while she keeps her money to herself. I'd really sit down and set some boundaries. And good luck with it, it's always better to be honest about your needs and feelings than eventually find them festering.", "So I think you confused the problem with the men in your family and thus the solution.\n\nThe opposite of what happened in your families past would be that the women dominate the money and men have no say... Obviously not a scenario either.\n\nMarriages are supposed to be partnerships, and that was actually the issue with the men in your family (I come from a mid east/Asian background so I'm familiar with heavy patriarchal societies), that the men held the purse and dictated how that money would be used.\n\nThe solution there is that neither party holds the purse and both decide on how the money should be used. Joint decision.\n\nYou sort of did that but somehow added some weird notion that the wife should not contribute to the purse at all? A great deal for your wife I guess but this isn't healthy for a relationship - and maybe the biggest sign of the unhealthiness of it all is that maybe one of the few times you've asked her to pitch in led to an argument.\n\nYou're nta - but.... My guy.. I'm missing how the partnership aspect of this relationship works.", "[deleted]", "Our six flags down the road is $169.00 pp.  You got a good price.", "So most of the house down payment and costs came from her savings?", "I'd honestly suggest couples' counseling and individual therapy for you.

Yeah, it\u2019s like I said: She\u2019s taking advantage of you. This is not an equal relationship in any way. You are doing way more than her. She should be doing most of the chores and home care and covering a % of the costs that is fair with the money she is bringing in. She\u2019s not working full time so she needs to be making that up. The financial abuse has bled over into other aspects of the relationship.", "That's good - sounds like necessities and day-to-day things are either roughly equal, or slightly skewed with your contribution being greater. \n\nSo for a vacation on top of those needs, asking her to contribute too is definitely fair. Her getting angry and giving you the silent treatment over a reasonable request is not an okay response at all. NTA.", "ESH = Everybody sucks here\n\nYou made your relationship about money when you let her have all her money while you support her and the house. She now expects you to forever provide and essentially pull most of the weight in this relationship. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s not been pulling her weight in other aspects of this relationship as well.\n\nEdit: just saw you say you do most of the housework and chores. It\u2019s as I said. This is a very unhealthy dynamic and honestly you may have to go through couples counseling.", "Seconding this, and adding that if your wife has anxiety or depression, that could be contributing to her reaction. I had no idea how much my anxiety and depression contributed to my extreme inability to have a conversation about finances until I got medicated.

But the point is, NTA, but don't let this situation fester, it's not good for either of you.", "I think you\u2019re right on it. Healthy boundaries are the answer, but they are hard to set after such a long pattern of living. In the past I\u2019ve tried to explain to her that after all the bills are said and done that I have no more money than her, but she just can\u2019t seem to get passed the idea that since I work full time that I have so much more than she does.", "jesus christ, i guess this is why my mom never took me there (aside from the fact that i never asked lol) \ud83d\ude30can\u2019t say i blame her tbh", "OP paid 3/4.", "A family budget spreadsheet will be your friend. It's easier to visualise the truth than have it verbally explained, especially since the verbal explanations haven't worked so far.\n\nMicrosoft has a free home budget template where you can keep track of multiple incomes, monthly expenses, bills, and cash flow. You'll be able to show her you're both left with the same disposable income and back yourself on why extra activities should be split."]}
