The guy seems shady.\n\nWell last week I got a box on my mat that definitely wasn't for me. Since our apartment numbers are the same expect for the A at the end of theirs it's an understandable mistake. It had the girl's name on it. I didn't steal it, I just left it. It was there for a couple days and then it was gone. I assumed she took it finally but I guess it was actually stolen which is too bad.\n\nThis morning I was outside watering a new plant and the girl came up and said she heard from a family member that they had sent her a surprise birthday present and they were wondering if she ever got it but she didn't. She showed me the delivery photo they forwarded to her and yep it was the box on my mat. I said I didn't take it which was true. Then she got upset and asked me if I realize that she moves my packages from her door to mine almost every week. I said I didn't ask her to do that and our door mats are only 5 feet apart so if I'm missing a package I can figure it out myself. She said she didn't know anyone was sending her anything and didn't think to come stand in front of my door and read what was on my mail. \n\nThen she said that I have a problem with her and her boyfriend because they're an interracial couple and she used me giving her the middle finger while driving in town as 'evidence'. I told her I have a problem with her and her boyfriend because they are shitty neighbors and they can't inconvenience everyone who lives around them and expect favors. Also she sucks at driving and I suspect that she left a small scrape on the corner of my car parking. Just another reason they are shitty neighbors.

It would literally be nothing to move her package to her door. You're being petty and childish. Good luck in life, you're going to need it", "YTA\n\nIf the door mats are 5 feet apart, by your logic, it's just as easy for you to move the package. I've delivered misdelivered packages that were for the same house number a block over. Maybe if you did nice things, they would be nice, too. They probably sense the fact that you don't like them, which is why they stopped saying hi.\n\nAlso, calling them the bane of your existence because the noises of them living life annoy you is petty. Sounds like the building is made of cheap materials that don't insulate sound. Part of living in a multi-unit complex is dealing with noise from the other units. If they move, you would probably hear the noises of the new tenants, and then they would be the bane of your existence.", "I don't get what they're meant to do to be \"considerate.\" You only hear a rumble from their TV, so it seems like it isn't loud. Because you can also hear them chopping things when cooking, and that *definitely* isn't a super loud activity. You didn't see her scrape your car. You just assumed it was her. She moved your packages over to you because most people would, even if not asked. I'd imagine they can also hear your TV, if you can hear them chopping things?

You were being petty and your pettiness caused her not to receive a gift that had been sent by a relative. \n\nShe is right - she shouldn't have to walk over and inspect every piece of mail left at your door, just in case it might be for her. And I wager if she did do that, you would be on here bitching about how weird your neighbor is for inspecting all your packages.\n\nMost of your issues with the neighbor have nothing to do with them being bad neighbors and everything to do with the place you live in being poorly built so you do hear everything through the walls. Their TV at a normal volume or cutting things on a chopping board are normal living noises. It's not like they're jackhammering the floors at 2AM. They're just living.", "YTA. They\u2019re five feet apart and you couldn\u2019t just move it? I understand not liking them, and if it happened all the time it would be different but seriously?

Wonder why they stopped being friendly?

You don\u2019t know if they called the police or not, just say you assume they did. \n\nHonestly, you sound pretty unfriendly and offish. \n\nThe bit with the package is very passive-aggressive.", "YTA, so what you have against her and her boyfriend are not significant, annoying but not a big deal. \n\nJust some common courtesy to move it over to her door.", "Homeslice, don\u2019t live in a first floor unit if you don\u2019t want to hear people living above you.

Do you want your neighbor to be constantly looking at the packages on your doormat? And do you want to have to constantly check the ones on their doormat?", "YTA. If you don't want to hear neighbors doing regular living activities, buy yourself a house that has no neighbors.", "YTA\n\nAs a former downstairs apartment neighbor to some pretty noisy upstairs neighbors, I get it.  I\u2019ve been someone\u2019s downstairs apartment neighbor for more than 20 years.  Being the downstairs neighbor in an apartment building is annoying.  You hear every sound they make as they live.  Downstairs apartment dwellers make the same noises.   Upstairs apartment neighbors can\u2019t help that their living noises are irritating to their downstairs neighbors if the building itself is not insulated well.\n\nIf you think they are shitty neighbors, I\u2019m sure they have a similar opinion of you.  \n\nMisdelivered packages are a thing now.  The neighborly thing to do is take the package that is not yours to its rightful owner.  Now that I live in a house, any packages or other mail I accidentally get for my neighbors gets carried to that neighbor.  I don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the package, nor do I care because it\u2019s none of my business.  I sure would hate for my neighbors to have a medical emergency because their medication was accidentally delivered to me instead of them.", "YTA - It sounds like you're the problem neighbour, in all honesty. Nothing what you said about these neighbours is bad enough for you to treat them this way. Per the noise, did you consider that your townhouse just has piss poor insulation so any level of noise bothers you? You make it sound like they stomping all over and slamming things, when it sounds like they're just walking around normally and watching TV. \n\nAnd instead of talking to them about it at any point, you went the passive aggressive route until they confronted you. \n\nSo yeah, maybe the package being stolen isn't your fault, but your hatred for your neighbours over things you never even talked to them about is what makes you an asshole overall.", "YTA - I could see if the package was stolen on the day it was delivered but you knowingly left it on your doorstep for multiple days.\n\nI get that they have done you wrong in the past, but you had a simple choice to make: Be kind, or Be Petty and you definitely showed it here so its understandable that she'd be upset about that.  \n\n\nEdit: Originally felt like ESH, but as I re-read the premise it became more clear that YTA so I changed it. There's nothing but suspicion on your end and it seems like you're just bitter about them being upstairs and having thin walls.", "[deleted]", "NTA.\n\nI live in a similar situation to you, and have always abided by one rule in this regard:\n\nI don't touch their shit. And they don't touch my shit.", "\"they are shitty neighbors and they can't inconvenience everyone who lives around them and expect favors\"\n\nTruth!  Shout the truth from the mountain tops!

I'd definitely keep an eye out for my packages so she doesn't steal them. But I certainly wouldn't help them regardless of how close the doors are.

It's not about race she's just a crappy neighbor.", "Dude does it take that much of an effort to move something 5 ft. Now her shit is gone cause of you yya", "YTA. Hearing other people's noises is part of living in shared housing. Them calling the cops because of a man and woman arguing is a little escalated but legit - they have no idea what's going on and domestic violence is a thing.\n\nLike you said, their mat is 5 feet away. It is nothing to move the package. Unless you want her coming over and picking up everything you get on your mat and inspecting it for their names, just move their stuff when you get it. Again, part of living in shared housing.\n\nIf you don't like it, move to a secluded house.", "YTA-  FFS i thought you meant were you the asshole for not walking the package upstairs! All you had to do was move it 5 feeet??? Yes you're the asshole!

You're being a dick just to be a dick.", "YTA. Can you imagine if I did this when my elderly neighbors groceries were delivered to me? She gets delivery because she has mobility issues. I started taking them to her door immediately. It's called basic human decency. How self centered and selfish are you? Also, it isn't Their fault the apartment has terrible sound issues. They're just living. Unless they're being jerks and stomping, playing music at 3 am at a high volume, they can't help that. If you can hear them chopping vegetables complain to the landlord.", "YTA sounds like you're also a shitty neighbor", "YTA 100%. them being noisy neighbors has nothing to do with you not doing the simple courtesy of moving a package over. mail is important! being petty over things it seems you havent even tried to discuss with your neighbors is ridiculous. the rest of what you have here is irrelevant.", "YTA\n\nI was with you pretty much all the way until you posted that the mats are 5' apart.
