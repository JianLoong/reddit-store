I\u2019m in the ninth grade and like going out with my friends most of which are older than me. I\u2019m 15M and my oldest friend that went last night was 17M. We got a couple looks but we brushed them off because oh well. When we got to the one house and walked up the lady hid her bowl under her chair and kinda shooed us off telling us we were too old. I will admit I looked at her a bit funny but respected it and we all walked off. Later on a police car pulled up to us and asked us why we were harassing this lady. We explained the situation and he wished us a happy Halloween and moved on. We were dressed as mercenaries and carrying unloaded airsoft guns all with orange tips. We weren\u2019t being overly loud and we weren\u2019t disrespectful to anyone, but got told off anyways. I think anyone should be able to trick or treat within reason. Did we do anything wrong? Are we assholes? I guess we could be the AH because we were \u201ctoo old\u201d to be out there but I think it was fine.\n\nI should also mention my friends mom and dad brought us and walked with us the entire time although they stayed far off during the night.", "created_utc": 1667350338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjquly/aita_for_trick_or_treating/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I hate this boomer mentality of \"teenagers are so wild and cause trouble every Halloween with their shenanigans\" while simultaneously holding the belief that teenagers are \"too old\" to trick or treat.

I don't have time to get that twisted.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but if you're in the US, I do NOT recommend walking around at night dressed as a mercenary complete with a fake gun. Any encounter with American police has the potential to turn deadly. Just pick a different costume next time.", "NTA but E-S-H adjacent. It's really messed up that she called the cops on you. But using guns as props for your costumes is also kinda messed up. I personally don't think little kids should be messing with fake guns either but at least when they do it's blatantly non-threatening. \n\nNot at all TA for getting your candy, I'm glad you're still enjoying your youth! But you are getting old enough to know that guns are deadly serious and shouldn't be treated casually. Doesn't happen often, but teens have been killed because someone mistook an orange-tipped play gun for the real thing. Be safe out there!", "YTA, but not for trick or treating. \n\nEvery Halloween, airsoft communities, fields, groups, clubs, and teams across the USA and the world repeatedly and loudly urge airsofters to NOT use their guns as part of their Halloween costumes. The potential for community panic (they look too realistic) is too high, the chances that another citizen will see you and call the cops because you have (what they think are actual) guns is very real, and the potential fallout if the police DO show up and think that your airsoft guns are real can be catastrophic. Any and all of these things will make it harder for the sport to exist and grow - it's already illegal in MANY communities to have airsoft guns at all.\n\nThis year, you and your friends were \"those guys\".  Please think harder next time and don't do this. You're not cool, you're not edgy, and you could have gotten the same effect with bright white and orange Nerf guns that no one will mistake for real.\n\nPictures like this are all over every retailer, Discord, and even here on /r/airsoft:\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/JgQQjmx.png\n\nPlease, stop it.", "NTA. Not at all, the only AH here is the old lady. It\u2019s a huge pet peeve of mine when people say someone is too old to trick or treat.

I always buy a ton and never get that many people so I give out handfuls to anyone lol\n\nyour costume makes you TA though", "YTA. If people of adult size came to my door dressed like that, I would take serious offence to that.", "NAH you're right anyone should be able to trick or treat but some people may run out of candy faster than others and may want to make sure they don't have to turn away younger kids who are out there. \n\nTheir should be a specific \"adult/older kid\" timeframe much like the concept of adult swim time that some pools have.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I love seeing teenagers trick or treating. \n\nThis post has made me think, though. As I mentioned upthread, any boomers who are cranky are perhaps reliving what people were like to *us* when we were perceived as too old. I was being told that when I was ten because I was tall.\n\nAnd then I thought - well, who was saying that to me when I was a child? The people who lived through the *Depression* and probably had real memories of scarcity and want. They might have been thinking through that lens - save the precious candy for the little kids. They would have been the generation who got candy and an orange for Christmas, and maybe nothing else.\n\nSo - perhaps this is just a case of a trauma almost 100 years ago still echoing through the generations. It\u2019s nice to see the general acceptance of older kids trick or treating but maybe we can cut everybody a little slack.", "I always ask the kids do do a trick to get the treats.

The whole thing should be about fun for heaven's sake.", "Ok, I\u2019m a boomer. Not only am I happy to get teenagers - I remember the stories my mum used to tell us about what teens got up to in the old days - the 1930\u2019s. Believe me, they were really *bad,* tipping over outhouses and things like that. That would be a real problem to fix, far worse than TP, and putting out of commission something people really needed. I was always astounded that people had done something so destructive, and I doubt today\u2019s teenagers would be anywhere near that.\n\nI think any grumpy boomers are doing it because that is what was done to *us,* and they haven\u2019t been able to get rid of their bitterness. I was a very tall kid and had people snarling at me for trick or treating as early as 10 years old. The very last year it was remotely \u201cok\u201d to trick or treat was grade seven.\n\nI get a real kick out of seeing older kids trick or treating, and of seeing adults joining in the fun.

She not only refused to give out candy, but literally shooed them away like a bug AND called the police on them.\n\nGenerational trauma is not an excuse or even an explanation for someone\u2019s crappy behavior - that\u2019s just their personality.
