I talked to George's workplace the day after I filed the report and they told me he had given his two weeks about a month ago.\r  \n\r  \nI then tried calling George again and he finally picked up. He told me he was okay but he had moved states and no longer wanted any contact with his children because it was all too much responsibility for him. I snapped at George and told him he couldn't just decide now he didn't want to be a father. Then George told me he never wanted kids in the first place and \"those kids don't look anything like me anyway\". George then told me to F off and hung up the call.\r  \n\r  \nAfter that I informed the police department what had happened to let them know George wasn't in any danger and that we knew his whereabouts. After that happened I just cried because I couldn't believe I had raised such a selfish person.\r  \n\r  \nSusanna has filed for full custody and George as far as I know is refusing to pay child support and will probably end up in jail at some point. Bethany is now 4 months pregnant and is having a boy, and George is the father. Somehow he managed to come up with the $500 so he will have to pay child support since he doesn't plan on being in the baby's life.\r  \n\r  \nBethany moved into my home in November since she's had trouble doing things herself and her doctor says she's at risk of pre-eclampsia if she becomes too stressed during the pregnancy. In that time we have gotten closer and despite how our first meeting went I actually have come to like Bethany.\r  \n\r  \nSorry this isn't the happy ending some of you were expecting, I have been following the advice I received from the first post and have not contacted George and he has not tried to contact me. I can only hope with time he pulls himself together and manages to step up as a father. Again thank you to everyone who gave helpful advice , I'm not sure if I will be updating further however.", "created_utc": 1702987991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m0gwf/update_aita_for_kicking_my_son_and_his_gf_out/", "score": 581, "replies": ["Oh wow!

You're an awesome grandparent and parent too!\n\nNTA", "All I can give are my condolences OP. And for the record, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your mess up that caused him to be that way. Sometimes you can raise a kid right and they turn out shitty no matter what. \n\nJust try to be there for your grandkids. It\u2019s obvious you love all of them a bunch, and maybe this will be a way for you to heal. I hope everyone in this situation is ok at the end of the day. \ud83e\udec2", "He won\u2019t step up as a father unfortunately. If he comes back into your lives, it\u2019s most likely when the kids are grown and he\u2019s desperate and needs financial help. You sound like a good person and I hope you and the family thrive wonderfully without George.", "Wow, this is just wow. George is the king of all deadbeats if I've ever heard of one before. Spineless, cowardly, and disgustingly selfish. Make sure both Susanna and Bethany completely take him for everything he's got. My heart breaks for them as well as your grandchildren who deserve a loving father.", "What a mess. Why would Bethany want to continue with this pregnancy? Doesn't sound like she has the family or the money needed for this child.", "I am so proud of you!!    \n\nWhen my bio-father decided to go deadbeat (I was in my teens and my brother was in 1st grade) his mother stayed a constant in our lives.  She helped us out with furniture and food and vacations and even introduced my mom (her DIL) to her second husband.  \n\nShe did NOT condone my father running off but she stayed a wonderful constant in my life.", "Oof. I say this honestly and not sarcastically- has Geoege been checked for a brain tumor?  They can cause HUGE personality shift.", "If and when you are in contact with George again, can you recommend that he get a vasectomy?\n\nI know you are probably going through a myriad of emotions right now, and it must be not be easy the Holiday season.\n\nGood Luck.", "Wow what a mess. It\u2019s incredible that you\u2019re able to stay so level headed. I am in no way qualified to say this, but it seems like George is severely depressed or something. I hope he can get it together before it\u2019s too late for him to make things right with his kids.", "She's getting full custody, sounds like a happy ending to me", "George realized he was in over his head and couldn't bear to live in his life, so he ran instead of un-aliving himself.\n\nIt's not a great or even good answer, but I understand the impulse.", "If he never steps up as a father, I hope you and the families he\u2019s left behind aren't kind to him when he inevitably returns. He deserves it after all he\u2019s done. You are incredibly kind, but that shouldn\u2019t include him. He\u2019d have squandered his chances. \n\nI do find it hilarious that ppl had so much horrible stuff to say about Bethany before the 1st update, and now you 2 have come to like one another. That\u2019s nice.\n\nBest of luck to you all.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this. Your grandchildren have a great support system through you and their mom. And it\u2019s so good to see you and Bethany getting close.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that he turned out like this. We all have to make our own decisions, good or bad. You are choosing not to support his bad decisions, and that is a good decision, and one that your grandchildren will see and appreciate.", "Thank you. It's been hard for our family to cope with George being so irresponsible and I have been in and out of the hospital for the past two weeks due to the stress of the whole situation.\n\nI hope George steps up, though he hasn't even sent Christmas gifts for his children.", "TY", "Yeah he's only coming back when he needs money, or to be bailed out of jail. OP, please tell him no when that time comes.", "Bethany is convinced that George will change his mind once the baby is born which I have tried to tell her probably won't be the case, but Bethany is convinced he will and no one can tell her otherwise.", "It could also be bipolar. With my dad, he\u2019d come in and out of our lives because he was undiagnosed and so he\u2019d leave because it was too hard and then come back and promise this time was different and he was going to be a better man and father.\n\nOr he could just suck. Either way, it\u2019s an unfortunate situation.", "I hope you are making time for you. Please loom into therapy if you have means and access. Help stress management tools will help protect your physical health as well. Good luck to you and your family.", "I hope you're not setting yourself on fire to keep everyone else warm. You already should be chilling and enjoying being a Grandma etc, and instead you're raising you grandkids while providing boyfriend support to your sons pregnant ex-girlfriend.\n\nIt's ok to sit Bethany down at some point and ask her what's her plan for money, housing and childcare for her baby. That she can't live with you forever while she waits years for George to change his mind. \n\nSounds like you aren't in the best health, and all this stress isn't helping. You won't be able to help anyone if you work yourself to death trying to make amends for George's absence and Bethany's poor decision.", "It makes sense why she was so confident that they were together when you kicked them out, and was so disappointed by him saying he didn\u2019t want to get remarried.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t understand him at all and she\u2019s setting herself up for heartbreak and disappointment. I hope she gets her head on straight soon.", "My husband and I are looking into funding some family therapy and individual therapy for the twins but we're waiting to see if our health insurance will cover it.", "If your health insurance doesn\u2019t cover much, trying looking for practitioners who offer a \u201csliding scale\u201d. A lot of therapists give discounted rates to people with financial stress. Also, be sure to check out therapists who are counsellors and social workers - their rates are generally lower than psychologists. (Source: I\u2019m a psychologist)  \n\nIf possible, you should also consider therapy for yourself. You\u2019re under a dangerous amount of stress and you\u2019re grieving the loss of a relationship with your son - it\u2019s okay to seek out support for that. \n\nAnd as an aside - you\u2019re an amazing human. What you\u2019re doing for Bethany and your grandchildren is incredible. My grandmother lied to CPS to cover for my abusive mom, so people like you are basically superheroes to me. Good luck OP", "Is George having some kind of emotional breakdown? People don\u2019t randomly divorce their wives, have flings, go no contact with their kids, quit their jobs and move interstate\u2026 unless they are going through something.", "There's a time and place in this process where Susanna and Bethany might want to meet.  There needn't be animosity between them - presumably Bethany started dating George after he and Susanna were divorced.  Instead, they both - and you - now all have to suffer the consequences of George's failures.  To that end, you are all in the same club.  If you are all ready to do so, having some coffee (or hot cocoa for the pregnant) and chatting about stuff might help you bond and cope.", "This IS a happy ending in the way that more people could use a caring and understanding person in their lives like you! \n\nIs it ideal? - no, but you did great given the circumstances!!", "My wife and I are having a baby in March, and I feel like ever since I learned I was going to be a dad, I've gotten so much more sensitive about anything involving kids, I'm literally tearing up thinking about these poor little girls who's dad just abandoned them, and the boy who will probably never have any kind of relationship with his dad. Thank god they all have such an amazing and caring grandparent in their lives!", "I hope you all change your wills and beneficiaries to specifically cut out George and this is why, because the portion that would have been his inheritance will go to his children (your known grandchildren) since he\u2019s skipping out on their lives.", "You can only lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink. Op's son might suck but it's definitely not a reflection of the hard work op probably had/still is putting in.", "Dude leaves his family, finds a new girlfriend, impregnates her, leaves again. \n\nThis isn't screaming brain disease. This is screaming Asshole.", "I mean, *really*. \n\nIt's not a happy ending per se, BUT Susanna is taking care of her children well solo; OP is in their lives; Bethany is being taken care of during her high-risk pregnancy; George has (thankfully) fucked right off. \n\nSounds as happy as you can get here.", "How does she treat to the twins? I would never let her near twins with this mindset.", "Bipolar people are often chasing the dopamine high of new relationships, and then bail when that high fades (either when the honeymoon ends or serious consequences like pregnancy arrive).", "It could be helpful to see what state or federal assistance Bethany might qualify for. In my state, pregnant mothers qualify for medicaid. She might be able to get housing assistance but there's usually a long wait. Try to convince her to get what help she can to take some of the burden off of you. If your son changes his mind and steps up, that's fine but it not, it will be a big help for her and you.", "Also, if either of you have an EAP at work they may cover a specific number of teletherapy appointments and anyone in the home is eligible.", "Susanna is going to take custody of the twins? What and angel. You have one child to be really proud of!\n\nNTA", "Wow. I'm really sorry about your son. That's got to be painful on a lot of levels. But I'm so pleased that you've bonded with Susana and Bethany and have embraced this unconventional family situation.", "Maybe Bethany just really wants to be a mother, too?", "I think you need to keep an eye on Bethany. If she's so deep in the 'he'll change when the baby is here' hole according to your comment, be prepared for her to fall hard when her hope doesn't happen. I'd honestly recommend that you set a boundary for her to get therapy in exchange for your help with the baby and a roof over her head. I'm just worried at the off-chance that she may lash out at the twins, your daughter, or you and your husband because of spineless George. In your previous post, she wanted to get married. I wonder how much of a mental toll it's taking on her watching her ex-bf's sister do what she wanted.", "Assholes with no mental issues do the same."]}
