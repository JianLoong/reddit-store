I wrote clearly that **I offered to pay her.** Next, I hired a professional when she refused the compensation and I felt it required more time committment. You make it sound as if she was working consistently for me, although it was a maximum of **total** 3-4 h during a period of 1.5 - 2 years.  \nWhich I am still grateful for, but I am willing to do for a friend (and have done), especially if they have the politeness to offer to pay.  \n\n3.

She is not easy to open up, imagine now a few weeks before her wedding (objectively stressful).\n\nNow regarding the rest, I asked multiple times. She said she was just extremely tired and for her friendship is being real and not having to put a face on. As said, she is not comfortable explaining or sharing her emotions. Months later, I fished that the day I had planned (of course after asking her to suggest or approve activities) was too slow and she was bored.  \nRegarding the \"*do I want to help you? NO*\" comment, I tried to have a long and calm conversation.  She kept on going how much she hates consultancy and how she was \"forced\" to be a consultant and deal with clients, that her role is now different than dealing with direct clients, and that it is not personal against me.

No matter how I am not fond of him  I must remain objective and fair and say that us being alienated from each other has nothing to do with him. \n\nFrom what I read here, and upon reflection, the alienation is most likely due to our widly different communication styles, conflicting needs, boundaries and even ways of seeing the world. She really values indepence over all, she wants to do all herself, where I love both doing big and small things for friends but also receiving help.

You can get a dog sitter.", "Why are you even asking if you're TA if you've decided you're not??? No is a perfectly valid answer. She said no and you got butthurt about the way she phrased it. She hates her job and has stated so numerous times, do you think she'd act thrilled about it??? She doesn't owe you a nice response for that especially because a week notice in the business world really isn't a lot of time especially for a favor. Sure could she? Yeah of course, but also you're refusing to listen from responders about why your friend responded the way she did. The more responds I'm reading are now making me think YTA", "2 things. First, it's clear you don't like this person, so you don't need to worry about offending her. The friendship is over and likely has been for some time.  She clearly doesn't see you as a close friend.  \n\nSecond, the \"offer\" to pay after calling it a \"BIG favor,\"  and thinking 1 week notice *isn't* short notice, are exactly the issues I'm talking about. If you were treating her as a professional, you woild have asked, \"can I hire you,\" not \"can you do me a a favor, ill pay.\" In my experience, people who say that never come close to paying my actual rate and get mad when I tell them what it is bc \"they reeeeally need the help.\"\n\n\nThis is similar to attractive women who get sick of being hit on in bars and eventually become rude, leaving men saying things like, \"I was just being friendly. You don't have to be rude.\" Being a professional constantly hit up for favors becomes grating. \n\n\nYou feel entitled to a polite response from her.  She feels entitled to a separation between work and friendship.  And, from her response, I doubt this is the first time you've gotten on her nerves.  \n\n\nYou can disagree with me all you want, but treating other professional friends in your life like this will eventually get them to pull away.  Just my 2 cents, since you came to a forum to specifically ask.", "IMO - Its extremely hard to turn down a friend and to come up with an excuse that wouldn\u2019t hurt friends feelings.

Better to not send anything.", "I know as a wedding thrower who had so many people who are subbed and didn't show offering the money from the dinners would be appreciated.\n\nOr you can rephrase your cancellation like this is in lieu of going. We have made a donation in x amount to such charity", "She didn't apologize for her tone being aggressive because she is not sorry for using an aggressive tone. It was purposeful because she wants you to stop asking her to do business consulting for you and you didn't take the hint all of the times she talked about how much she hates business consulting.", "I really do not understand why you\u2019re mad at your friend. She specifically explained to you why she didn\u2019t want to help you with the business part.

I explicitly said \"Can I please hire you? Even an hour would be fine, if you are super busy \". The \"BIG FAVOUR\" , which I also explicitly said, was with regards to basically helping me (paid help is still help) within only a week of notice, and getting me out of a potentially bad situation (submitting my BP without a pro checking it). My message continued \" I understand it is a BIG favour, and you might be super busy or overwhelmed, so I totally understand if you cannot, no worries at all\".  I am sorry for your experiences, but your case is not the same like mine.  \n2. I actually do a lot of (what you could refer to as free work) for friends (as I was quite accomplished in my day job, although I ended up not liking it). I still do, because I see they can end up in a difficult situation (that is not their fault, eg a professional ditching them last minute) and trying my best to help. However, I totally respect that not everyone is the same, and some like a clear separation. That is very fair and we can agree on. What we disagree on, is that you say it somewhat justifies a rude and aggressive response before even trying politely, first. I think anyone could simply reply to my message as \"actually, yes, I am super overwhelmed atm, I hope you find someone else.\" that would be totally cool. So let's agree to disagree.   \n\n\n3. If I disliked or did not care about this person, would not bother wondering if IATA and if I should go or not.. Clearly, I feel very hurt and not fairly treated, and conflicted between being there for her or look out for my needs.", "I see your point...because i am hurt.... and have a lot on...And if I put all this effort again (as I did when I hosted her and for her birthday), find day/night care for the puppy that is not even crate-trained, travel 5h one way, in the middle of 2 deadlines that make it or break it, only to get her (now usual) negativity, I might be even more upset.\n\nTbh, what upset me more than anything was that she never apologised for her rude comment or acknowledge she was being hurtful.  Also, the fact that she never realised how she comes across, when I am supporting her and keep my unsolicited opinions to myself, while she rudely named me \"unrealistic\" for simply daring to pursue a job/Career I enjoy", "They specifically asked charity donations instead of presents.", ">If she really isn\u2019t a friend then why do you think she wants you at her wedding?

She replied, \"You put me in a very difficult position. Can I help you? Yes. Do I want to help you? No.\"\n\nI would really like to know how you phrased your ask here.\n\nIt matters for interpreting her response (which it seems like you may have quoted verbatim, but all we know is that you used the phrase \"BIG favor\"), as well as your statement that \"her tone and approach was inconsiderate\".", "My question is if you only RSVP'd 3 months ago, why are the deadlines and puppy training becoming an issue now? I understand you're hurt with her rude behavior and I agree she could've worded it better, but you also kept pushing her boundaries. You asked for favors on a skill she has openly spoke she does not enjoy and when she said no you got upset.\n\nShe may have created distance because you were repeatedly asking for favors and not taking her refusal well and gave up trying to communicate that. It is also possible that she was having a hard time with life and pulling away from everyone at that time. \n\nThis post seems very centered around you and why she has hurt you and not at all trying to understand why your friend has been acting the way she did. I say ESH. What drastically changed in 3 months from your earlier RSVP?", "It does seem like you made up your mind about this friendship.

So, if I were you\u2026I would take this opportunity to start fresh. Go support her and have fun! See if this mends your relationship. Also, her behavior may not even have anything to with you. Maybe it\u2019s something she went through that she wasn\u2019t comfortable sharing with anyone.   \nPoint is\u2026if you bail then this will most likely be nail in the coffin. If you go\u2026.friendship can be renewed.", "What drastically changed in 3 months from your earlier RSVP?: Things changed, both practically but also my thinking tbh. So acceptance on  incubator came 2 months ago and exact deadlines communicated to me 10 days ago, as these things are often agile. (I was hoping for a much later deadline, but they decided to put me earlier on). Now the puppy is a rescue, so not something you always plan (you find a rescue, you connect, you want to save it if you can. And we can). Also, in the light of honesty, I did some thinking - as in the beginning it never occured to me not to go (I thought I should burry my feelings and be there for her, and only discuss it after her wedding, when the stress has passed for her).", "I should have specified, no worries :)"]}
