When talking about my financial aid, my mom was constantly talking about how she was gonna take it from my account (we had a shared account at the time as I had just turned 18 a couple months before this) and how she would send me money every week or basically as she saw fit. I was uncomfortable with this as she has made my sister take out loans to pay for their Disney vacation and use her aid to buy her new sewing machine to which my dad had to pay her back both times. I tried to say something at first but she quickly shut it down. After talking to my sister and dad, they advised me to make my own account for the money to go to. I felt bad but didn\u2019t want to say anything to my mom as it would make her mad and I didn\u2019t want to be made to switch it back. She kept talking about it and I said nothing about my plan (keep in mind not saying anything was advised by my sister and dad). But Rhee and my dad were planning a trip to the mountains and the closer the time came for them to book the place, mom talked more and more about my aid and asking me if it had came in yet. The day it came in I had gone to work with my dad so I planned on telling her that night to which my dad agreed with. An hour after she got to work she called me saying she had called the people in the financial aid department and they told her the money had been sent out already. (She works at the university) so I told her it had just gotten deposited in the bank and she asked what bank cause she didn\u2019t see it to which I told her it was in my bank that I had made. She was fuming and didn\u2019t talk to me for awhile and said how much i was a terrible person for lying to her and not saying anything when she talked about it and so on. My dad and sister both claimed to have nothing to do with it and didn\u2019t want to get involved even after me telling them I felt bad about it. She went and cried to her in laws and as a narcissist she told the story in a way that made her the victim.

Your mother is a thief and the best thing to do was make it impossible for her to steal from you. I'm not sure why your dad is being spineless about calling her out when he knows that she is stealing from her children. That's a whole other issue in and of itself. \n\nBut, your mother stealing your aid to use for her personal expenses, is fraud. And since she works for the university, she could very easily (and probably should) lose her job. \n\nNTA by an stretch. Keep your aid and get your education and get the hell away from that toxic narcissist before she ruins your life.", "NTA. You made a smart move.", "Obviously NTA, and she\u2019s not \u201cmanaging\u201d your money, she\u2019s stealing your money. YOUR money.

Whether or not you should have told her earlier is immaterial. Learning when NOT to trust people is an important and difficult lesson. It sounds like you are ahead of many people in life in that regard.", "NTA: Dude, your mom could not be more obvious she was trying to straight up steal your money. And both your Dad and sister advised you to do this. I know you're 18 and it probably wouldn't fly - but I'd laugh in her face. You're good. Keep doing what you are doing.

What your mom did with your sister\u2019s aid money was unfair to your sister, and in most jurisdictions around the world, fraudulent. Educational aid money generally has strings tied to it in terms of what you\u2019re allowed to spend it on, and family vacations don\u2019t fit under the purview. This could\u2019ve landed your sister in legal hot water (both criminally and civilly). Both your sister and your dad (more on them later)- the two people with direct experience of your mother\u2019s handling of financial aid money- advised you not to let it happen. That aid money is yours, and she has bo right to commandeer it. You did something you had every right to do, and you did so to avoid the liability of potential criminal malfeasance. You did the responsible thing. Your mother is displaying some rather narcissistic tendencies in the way she has manipulated the fall out. She is not a victim just because you deprived her of the chance to mishandle your finances. The fact that she is lying to your family to get them to punish you for her is gross. She is a total asshole, and if I were you, I\u2019d be making plans to live on campus and out from under her roof full time.\n\nYour sister and your dad earned some asshole points, too. While I\u2019m glad they advised you to safeguard your aid from your mom\u2019s schemes, you don\u2019t just take someone by the hand and guide them into the path of a shitstorm and then bail when the turds start flying. They\u2019re assholes for not having your back. They should be defending you to mom *and* to the family members to whom she\u2019s lying about you. This lands heavier on your dad than on your sister (though she\u2019s still wrong), because his parental obligation to be in your corner is far greater. Furthermore, given the history with your sister, he stands to gain from all this. By not letting your mom spend your aid money dishonestly, you\u2019ve ensured he won\u2019t have to bail her out again. Seriously, this is a rather cowardly cop out on his part. If I were you, I\u2019d tell them that you\u2019re not gonna keep their names out of it.

You have the right to manage your own money if that's your choice. I happen to manage my son's college funds but he could if he wanted to.

Make sure she has no permissions on your accounts and change any passwords and don't share with her. Also get a credit check done (you can do this for free) and do it regularly. I've know parents to financially abuse their student child for instance taking out loans, credit accounts or credit cards in their name. This is an abusive situation and you may need some support. It will help you to set more appropriate boundaries in your relationship. Your university should have some counselling you can speak to about the situation.", "Please run a credit check.

She has no right to that money and by law, she can't switch it out of your account. \n\nJust make sure the financial aid office has to contact you if she attempts to change deposit information. She is violating the law if she even accesses your information without your permission. \n\nShe can complain all she wants but all you need to say is that you can manage your own money since you're an adult. She has no valid reason to need to manage your money.", "NTA the faster you learn to manage your own finances the better.  Also, don\u2019t mix family and money.", "is that even legal? i thought that money was meant for college expenses?", ">she told the story in a way that made her the victim.\n\nVictim of what? \n\nSee the thing is... if she was genuinely going to budget your money to you to cover your expenses or whatever... the purpose of that would be to keep *you* from accidentally messing up your finances. The person harmed if you did mess up your finances would be... you. So there's no victim if you don't mess up, and you're the victim if you do.\n\nOn the other hand, if she was intending to use your student aid money on herself (which is actually illegal) then she would be victimizing you.\n\nThose are the only possible reasons she would need access to your funds.\n\nYou had *your* money wired into *your* bank account.\n\nThere is no harm to her.\n\nWhat *would* harm her is if you actually took the steps you have a legal right to. \n\nLike reporting her to the university for abusing her position to obtain information she should not have.\n\nOr reporting her to law enforcement for reading your email. Well... not for reading it... that's not illegal. It's unauthorized access which is illegal. *Even if* you have the password. Even if you were *given* the password by the account holder.\n\nAnd ofc there's the whole FAFSA fraud thing, attempting to use your student aid funds for disallowed purposes... though I doubt that would go anywhere since she never got to use them. But you could call and check with the Federal Student Aid Information Center (FSAIC) at 1-800-433-3243. \n\nAnyway...\n\nAnyone siding with your mother has a stake in this. It's blatantly obvious she had no reason/right to do this.\n\nYour dad and sister were looking out for you.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. It doesn't matter that you didn't correct her assumption, because she was assuming you would abet her in her illegal activities. You don't owe her a response, you just... don't do it. Good choice.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA. You put your money in your bank account where you control your access and your spending in relation to your money. Where in that does your mom come in to play?

NTA", "NTA. Don't mix family and money, never ends well. Even more so when you already saw how it went down with your sister.\n\nHowever, I would say just a tiny tiny tiny ESH for: a, you lied to her, if you wanna keep a relationship and make it as healthy as possible don't lie to people you care for, you don't have to tell the whole truth all of the time and you don't have to feel obligated to share everything all of the time but there should always be some honesty. Your dad and sister also suck for bailing as soon as it got uncomfortable, however at least at some point they had their intentions in the right place, cuz they gave you good advice.\n\nYour mom however? The AHole. And you need to have a talk with her. Make it clear that you're an adult now, and she can't and shouldn't bully her way into your finances.

While she would\u2019ve probably spent the money and paid it back without me ever knowing, she would never go into my account and take out loans or apply for cards in my name. There is a line at some points, but I just wanted to know if other people would\u2019ve made the same decision I did and if I should\u2019ve done things differently. There\u2019s a thousand more of these posts I could make but this was the most recent one that\u2019s been bothering me a lot.", "Unfortunately, she very well could be capable of that. Coercing your sister into financing her life with her loans is still a form of financial abuse; it\u2019s bad enough that your father and sister both want you to keep her away from your funds. Ultimately, you are the best judge of your relationship with your mother, but I do hope you consider a few things. \n\nI would strongly recommend you remove her from any access to your university information. However you want to approach this, you need this boundary for a healthier relationship. I disagree with the secretive approach your family recommended because there is no way to avoid your mother finding out about it. You need to confront this situation head on. \n\nHave an honest, respectful but firm conversation with your mother. If she tries to shut you down, you need to continue to insist on being heard \u2014 even if it means trying again a dozen times. You explain that this is one of many items you must manage on your own as you are becoming a responsible adult. I would be frank about how the use of your sister\u2019s loans was inappropriate, and it cannot happen with yours. If she tries to explain this away, you need to stick firmly with the response that it was inappropriate. It does not need to be judgmental language. A great deal of careers (including those in accounting, finance, grants and executive leadership) require a great deal of financial integrity, so it is important for your future. You can involve her recommendations and life lessons in your financial planning, but you must have clear boundaries in place. \n\nI would warn you to really examine her response to this conversation and her past behavior. There\u2019s a reason your father and sister wanted her far away from your money. It isn\u2019t normal at all for her to freak out so much that her 18 year old daughter has an account she cannot access. That is too controlling. \n\nBest of luck. NTA", "But she is like that.

You say you\u2019re used to it, and I don\u2019t doubt it at all, but I can guarantee you that once you free yourself of it, you will physically feel the weight lifted off your shoulders.
