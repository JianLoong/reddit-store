My mom would always work late to earn money but whatever money she earned she would give to my 17 M brother mike and nothing to me or my 17 m brother Cal. I didn\u2019t really care all that much since it was my mother\u2019s money so I got a job to take care of of me and cal. Growing up Mike was the golden child and could do no wrong. One time he sold my laptop to get a new game console and my mom said that boys will be boys he also stole 300$ from me to get alcohol but she said that it doesn\u2019t matter and I should be glad that my brother wanted money from me. As soon as I turned 18 I got my own place and moved out. On my 20th birthday I decided that I was going to take my family out to get some food and I would pay for me and Cal and my mom was going to pay for her and Mike the dinner was going smoothly until the waiter brought out the food and when Mike seen that Cals food looked better then his he started to throw a fit and my mother told cal to give his food to Mike and take his, to let you know cal is vegetarian and I\u2019ve been supporting him and buying him the right things he needs while Mike loves meat so I don\u2019t even know why he would want cals food when it was all vegetarian. Cal refused to give him his food stating that he doesn\u2019t eat meat so he wouldn\u2019t be able to eat if he gave his food up. Our mom didn\u2019t like that fact and started berating him in the middle of the restaurant. She took it to far when she called him a f***ing f*got  Cal came out as gay when he was 15 and suffered from depression because of Mike bullying him.  I stood up grabbed Calls food and looked over at Mike who was sitting there the whole time grinning ear to ear while listening to our mom berate his twin so I dumped the entire vegetable soup on his head and grabbed cals hand paid for our food and walked out of the restaurant and we got into my car drove back to our moms house grabbed his stuff then I took him to stay with me. After a few weeks cal turned 18 and got a new boyfriend I took them both out to his favorite restaurant and he had a blast at the end I got a call from our mom asking how cal was doing and if he was doing anything. I told her that I took him and his boyfriend out for dinner for his birthday she went quiet on the other end then after about a min she says why didn\u2019t I take Mike with us since it\u2019s also his birthday and he\u2019s my brother too and if anything I should take him out and not cal since he was a disgrace to god by sharing a Bed with a man.here\u2019s where I might be the asshole At that moment I only saw red and started screaming at her over the phone and telling her that cal is my only brother and Mike will always mean nothing to me from the way he treated cal and that she was a disgrace to god for only caring about one of her children and leaving her other two to fin for themselves and that all Mike ever did was steal and bully cal and I. I told her why doesn\u2019t she do us all a favor and take Mike and get the hell out of our lives and to never ever try to speak to cal or me again.", "created_utc": 1700513658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17zyp0z/aita_for_for_removing_my_mom_and_brother_for_the/", "score": 120, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
