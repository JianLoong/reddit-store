It\u2019s a reason why he doesn\u2019t naturally notice things, but it\u2019s not an excuse to not put in the effort.", "NTA; He's honestly just being lazy and blaming it on his ADHD, which is no excuse. Sure, it can be a factor of some things he may struggle with, but that doesn't actively excuse his lack of responsibility or cleanliness.\n \nAs you said, he does well at managing his ADHD career wise, so there's no reason it shouldn't be a problem at home too. He has to actively work on house chores he struggles with, because if he doesn't there will be no progress. \n\nHe needs to do better, you're not in the wrong. Hell, I'd be stressed too in this situation where I'm the main one cleaning", "NTA - It is on him to get help to learn how to manage his ADHD if it is causing him issues. Therapy, medication, setting reminders in his phone - whatever is available to him. HE needs to write down the list of what needs to be done.\n\nI have ADHD and have similar struggles as your bf. It is true that you really do not see even obvious things. Or you do see it and you walk away to get something to deal with it and forget on the way. It is a constant struggle. That said, it doesn't sound like he is doing the work to manage his issues and find coping skills that work for him. There are LOADS of resources.", "NTA. There are plenty of tools to assist. My husband and I use the same cleaning schedule app. It gives him a breakdown of tasks by room and when they should be done and eliminates the mental load of me explaining the random cleaning tasks like washing windows. And we can both see when the tasks were last completed which helps us keep on top of cleaning together.", "NTA. But your boyfriend is one fure sure. I'm pretty sure his eyes are working to such a degree that he's able to detect dirty spots. If he's smart enough to cope with ADHD regarding his career, he should also have the cognitive capacities to make a list on his own. \n\nYou've pretty much nailed it. He lowkey expects you to run most of the household, sounds clich\u00e9 to me. Sound like a misogynistic convervative asshole.", "NTA. Break up.", "Does he have an explanation for who he thinks would perform these tasks for him if you were incapacitated or gone? \n\nLike, does he have any plan for care since he has indicated his adhd is so severe and unmanageable he cannot be expected to perform necessary tasks for daily living?", "So he\u2019s apparently capable of sharing *some* tasks, but not others? I\u2019m no medical expert, but it sounds to me like he\u2019s using his ADHD as an excuse to pick and choose what he wants to help with and doesn\u2019t want to help with. \n\nThis being said, I don\u2019t think the issue has anything to do with misogyny, just sounds like plain laziness. In any case, NTA.", "YTA\n\nYou have been living together for 5 months. A lot of the chores you have listed that they are not doing are not daily chores. You admitted that he has done those things a handful of times, while also keeping up on the chores he does more than you.\n\n When he asked you for help to schedule when these things need to be done on an irregular basis, you basically told him to get fucked. Then had the audacity to send him a video on misogyny?!\n\nGrow up, sit down with your boyfriend, and discuss how to divide chores in the future and when they need to be done. Otherwise, end it and go find happiness.", "NAH\n\nYou deserve him pulling his equal share on these other tasks. I think you\u2019re probably both a little right. \n\nThere is probably some subconscious, patriarchal coding of the tasks at play. But from my experience living alone with ADHD, some tasks are a nightmare to try and stay on top of while others are less so. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying that these particular chores don\u2019t stay with him for whatever reason. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with KC Davis, she sells printable guides for keeping house that a lot of ADHD people find very useful for staying on top of it. She does customizable lists and guides so things don\u2019t get missed/forgotten.\n\nETA that your hardline against making a list is just ridiculous. You\u2019re the partner with the higher standard of cleanliness for your home, so you\u2019re going to be the one who ends up noticing more. Just sit down and make a plan together so the planning is a shared responsibility.", "Kinda a tough one here. I understand the annoyance of having to do a majority of the housework and having to repeat yourself when it comes to the division of labor within the household.\n\nAt the same time though, I don\u2019t see how implying that he\u2019s a misogynist and then sending him a video to also call him a misogynist helps the situation. He can just as well turn it around and call you an ableist for disregarding his ADHD, and honesty I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some people do call you an ableist for calling his ADHD an excuse. \n\nGoing back to my experience with a similar issue, I never screamed or talked down to my SO about the imbalance of chores. We just sat down one day, talked about the pig sty that we lived in, and I expressed how I couldn\u2019t keep up with doing all the chores and that we needed to come up with a schedule. She agreed, and we made a chores schedule that works with both of our schedules outside of the house. \n\nYou otherized your SO and Im assuming that\u2019s why he asked you to make a list for him. Now you guys are fighting over something that could\u2019ve been figured out had y\u2019all just acted like adults and sat down to discuss the issue. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nThis is where you flipped sides:\n\n>he told me to write him a list of what needs to be done and when. i said no because im not taking on the mental load of being the household manager and sent him a video about how it is unfair when women have to manage and delegate tasks and schedules for their spouse to do their share of the work.\n\nIn any shared living arrangement people are going to disagree about when something needs to be cleaned so it makes sense to agree on that. I'm not an expert in ADHD but it does result in executive disfunction so needing lists etc to ensure tasks get done is important. With the video you just inflamed the argument for no reason. I think you've really made a mountain out of a molehill by letting the stress build until it boiled over instead of intervening early.\n\nI would note the two tasks he does do regularly are obvious they need doing ie you can easily see when the grass is long and the fridge empty however seeing when bed sheets are dirty is far more difficult.\n\nJust give him a simple list of things you want him to do ie vacuum weekly, change beds weekly and he should be able to take care of the rest.", "Yeah you\u2019re the asshole", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you can\u2019t ask your partner to help you, who can you ask? OP could take an hour to sit down with him to create a list of chores they\u2019re each responsible for.

For example, he says notices dishes in the sink because he uses it daily but does not notice dirty baseboards. With bed sheets, he says because they\u2019re washed after a week as opposed to a daily chore, he forgets. But yeah, I suspect it is an excuse as well. \n\nI think I labeled it as misogyny because in trad households, women are responsible for the brunt of cleaning, especially deep cleaning.

I sent him a video from a psychologist on emotional labor and being the household manager and how that\u2019s a job in and of itself.

He asked me to make the list FOR him. I sent him a pre made list from online, something he could\u2019ve taken the initiative to look for himself. \n\nThe other chores aren\u2019t irregular. They\u2019re regular and go by a rule of thumb that you can see online or any cleaning self help/blog post. Eg change the sheets once a week.

Patriarchy goes deep whether realized or not. \n\n-the video was about emotional labor and being the household manager and how that is work in and of itself. He rolled his eyes when I brought this up, so I sent him a video of a psychologist explaining it so he could understand it\u2019s real and valid. \n\n-while his adhd is not his fault, it\u2019s his responsibility. He uses therapy, strategies, and tools to help him be successful and on top of things in his personal life and at work. Why has he not used those strategies for this (especially after I suggested it long ago?). Ironically enough, my therapist believes I myself have adhd. \n\n-we both began raising our voices.

This is fully true", "He did ask to make a list together. He asked her to make a list FOR him. That\u2019s unfair, he knows the toilet needs scrubbed he just has trouble remembering to do it.", "Asking her to make a list is not doing the work. It's putting more work on the person already doing the work.", "We use Sweepy. There are a lot of cleaning scheduling apps. You set up the tasks by room and how often it needs to be done and then you are good to go.", "I\u2019m glad you got a laugh but I am being for real too. Like, why has he been able to organise his work where the consequences of neglect will hurt him, but at home where you pick up his slack he can\u2019t possibly get his shit together.  It looks a lot like weaponised incompetence.", "This is typical for a person with ADHD. Have you educated yourself on this disorder? There\u2019s a  lot of information available for partners of people with ADHD that could help you understand your partner better. He\u2019s not making excuses.

When you mentioned the online schedule it sounded more like an example rather than something he should follow exactly, I expect it includes every chore so it would be good to decide on a split.\n\nIt sounds a bit like you both have some gaps in your communication. I think you could have been clearer with him earlier but also he should have asked for a schedule earlier. His ADHD may be a factor in this as the previous comments may not have fully registered, yes it's he who has it but you're both going to have to work with it for things to work.", "Precisely. There is no reason why he couldn't google a list of chores the way OP did in the end.\n\nThis is more than just ADHD, this is weaponized incompetence", "People with ADHD need things like schedules to ensure they do tasks otherwise they can get distracted and become hyper focussed on the wrong thing.  That doesn't mean OP needs to produce a detailed schedule, just a post it with a couple notes on it and then let him use the existing system he uses for work.", "I never said it was impossible. I do well at work and in school but by the time I get home I am so burned out from masking and I need help. That\u2019s why I have a cleaning service.", "I never said it couldn\u2019t be learned. I said it was difficult.", "He proposed that she make a list for him. OP proposed he make a list and run it by her. I\u2019m saying they should compromise and do it together.", "Yeah I agree. I said, would you expect a co worker to do your tasks because you forgot to do them? No way. So why is he not even treating me with the same respect as a damn co worker?", "I know these are typical issues for people with adhd. I\u2019ve listened to podcasts, read books, etc about adhd to help understand him more. Funnily enough, my therapist thinks I have adhd myself and wants me to be evaluated. \n\nThe real issue is not his adhd. The issue is how he is not using his strategies, therapy, and tools to address this problem. He is awesome at remembering birthdays and to pay bills and appointments because he sets reminders. He does great at work because of his calendars. Why is he not using those strategies for these tasks, especially when it is damaging our relationship?", "I\u2019m glad my clarifications left you speechless", "Thank you. \n\nWhile many jobs do and should offer accommodations, he does not use those in his workplace.

Why was I the one googling and sending him chore lists and schedules. He has a computer.", "So he can make a list. The fuck?", "People with adhd are not unable to learn how to manage this stuff themselves. They\u2019re not children nor are they stupid. Adhd patients need to learn how to manage things like schedules and such on their own. \n\nDoing it for them is not teaching them any skills that in the future will help them while living with adhd.\n\nYou\u2019re responsible for your own diagnoses including educating yourself on it. Therapy. Medication management. You can\u2019t just be like \u201cwell I\u2019m adhd I can\u2019t do it\u201d.\n\n\nThere are literal autistic adults that live alone and handle their stuff on their own. With the help of therapy. And education. So I don\u2019t see people with adhd having any excuse.", "That\u2019s great for you but ops partner has not hired a cleaning service, and claims his disability means he cannot see that his own toilet or sink is dirty.   He needs to grow up and either hire services to manage what he cannot become competent at or he needs to apply his work discipline to his home life instead.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying you think it\u2019s impossible, I\u2019m saying there\u2019s zero excuse to be able to organise his work but not his own toilet brush.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair but everything\u2019s just a little bit harder for us with disabilities. He\u2019s tired but so is his partner. Why does his tiredness mean he\u2019s no longer accountable for his own needs?", "And it\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s his responsibility to learn instead of putting the work on others.", "Because you will wash his sheets and scrub the dunny bowl even if you\u2019re mad, cause you have to use the sheets and the toilet too.  his coworkers can and likely will tell him to go fuck himself and he has to deal with consequences.", "I\u2019ll tell you why. When he gets an alert that it\u2019s his friends birthday, it takes him ten second to drop what he\u2019s doing to send a happy birthday text. Same thing with paying bills. A calendar reminder isn\u2019t going to help him with cleaning because he probably won\u2019t be in a position to clean when the reminder comes through. \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say he sets the reminder for 9am on Saturday mornings. If he\u2019s eating breakfast or getting dressed when that reminder comes up, he\u2019s going to have to wait until he\u2019s finished to actually start cleaning. That leaves a lot room for a lot of other things to grab his attention and before he knows it, the day has gone by and he hasn\u2019t cleaned yet. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re not able to regulate your attention. \n\nAfter struggling with this very issue for years, I threw in a towel and hired a cleaning service and it\u2019s one of the best decisions I ever made. I have told my fianc\u00e9 that if he will taken the lead on light housekeeping (daily sweeping, making the bed etc.), I would pay for a cleaning service to come in every two weeks and do the deeper cleaning.

You obviously don\u2019t want to provide the kind of support he expects from a partner so why not end things now so you both can find what you\u2019re looking for?", "Where are your credentials???", "Because jumping to ending a relationship over one issue I hope we can work out is hasty.\n\nSupport is not doing the chores for him or making a list for him that he is capable of doing, as he has shown in other areas of his life via tools and strategies. Support is holding him accountable, not infantilizing him because he had ADHD.", "This isn\u2019t one issue. ADHD affects every area of a person\u2019s life. Once you get over this issue, there\u2019s going to be something else. You need to ask yourself if you have the patience to deal with that. If you don\u2019t want to make a list for him, compromise and make the list together. There\u2019s a line between helping and enabling. Helping would be brainstorming the list together and holding him accountable to the things you mutually agreed that he would do."]}
