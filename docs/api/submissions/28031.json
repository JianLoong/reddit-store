Sure, it can be a factor of some things he may struggle with, but that doesn't actively excuse his lack of responsibility or cleanliness.\n \nAs you said, he does well at managing his ADHD career wise, so there's no reason it shouldn't be a problem at home too. He has to actively work on house chores he struggles with, because if he doesn't there will be no progress. The more he works on what he struggles with, the better/easier it will get for him to deal with \n\nHe needs to do better, you're not in the wrong. Hell, I'd be stressed too in this situation where I'm the main one cleaning", "NTA - It is on him to get help to learn how to manage his ADHD if it is causing him issues. Therapy, medication, setting reminders in his phone - whatever is available to him. HE needs to write down the list of what needs to be done.\n\nI have ADHD and have similar struggles as your bf. It is true that you really do not see even obvious things. Or you do see it and you walk away to get something to deal with it and forget on the way. It is a constant struggle. That said, it doesn't sound like he is doing the work to manage his issues and find coping skills that work for him. There are LOADS of resources.", "NTA. There are plenty of tools to assist. My husband and I use the same cleaning schedule app. It gives him a breakdown of tasks by room and when they should be done and eliminates the mental load of me explaining the random cleaning tasks like washing windows. And we can both see when the tasks were last completed which helps us keep on top of cleaning together.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Break up.", "Does he have an explanation for who he thinks would perform these tasks for him if you were incapacitated or gone? \n\nLike, does he have any plan for care since he has indicated his adhd is so severe and unmanageable he cannot be expected to perform necessary tasks for daily living?", "So he\u2019s apparently capable of sharing *some* tasks, but not others? I\u2019m no medical expert, but it sounds to me like he\u2019s using his ADHD as an excuse to pick and choose what he wants to help with and doesn\u2019t want to help with. \n\nThis being said, I don\u2019t think the issue has anything to do with misogyny, just sounds like plain laziness. In any case, NTA.", "YTA\n\nYou have been living together for 5 months. A lot of the chores you have listed that they are not doing are not daily chores. You admitted that he has done those things a handful of times, while also keeping up on the chores he does more than you.\n\n When he asked you for help to schedule when these things need to be done on an irregular basis, you basically told him to get fucked. Then had the audacity to send him a video on misogyny?!\n\nGrow up, sit down with your boyfriend, and discuss how to divide chores in the future and when they need to be done. Otherwise, end it and go find happiness.", "NAH\n\nYou deserve him pulling his equal share on these other tasks. I think you\u2019re probably both a little right. \n\nThere is probably some subconscious, patriarchal coding of the tasks at play. But from my experience living alone with ADHD, some tasks are a nightmare to try and stay on top of while others are less so. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s lying that these particular chores don\u2019t stay with him for whatever reason. \n\nIf you aren\u2019t familiar with KC Davis, she sells printable guides for keeping house that a lot of ADHD people find very useful for staying on top of it. She does customizable lists and guides so things don\u2019t get missed/forgotten.\n\nETA that your hardline against making a list is just ridiculous. You\u2019re the partner with the higher standard of cleanliness for your home, so you\u2019re going to be the one who ends up noticing more. Just sit down and make a plan together so the planning is a shared responsibility.", "Kinda a tough one here. I understand the annoyance of having to do a majority of the housework and having to repeat yourself when it comes to the division of labor within the household.\n\nAt the same time though, I don\u2019t see how implying that he\u2019s a misogynist and then sending him a video to also call him a misogynist helps the situation. He can just as well turn it around and call you an ableist for disregarding his ADHD, and honesty I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some people do call you an ableist for calling his ADHD an excuse. \n\nGoing back to my experience with a similar issue, I never screamed or talked down to my SO about the imbalance of chores. We just sat down one day, talked about the pig sty that we lived in, and I expressed how I couldn\u2019t keep up with doing all the chores and that we needed to come up with a schedule. She agreed, and we made a chores schedule that works with both of our schedules outside of the house. \n\nYou otherized your SO and Im assuming that\u2019s why he asked you to make a list for him. Now you guys are fighting over something that could\u2019ve been figured out had y\u2019all just acted like adults and sat down to discuss the issue. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nThis is where you flipped sides:\n\n>he told me to write him a list of what needs to be done and when. i said no because im not taking on the mental load of being the household manager and sent him a video about how it is unfair when women have to manage and delegate tasks and schedules for their spouse to do their share of the work.\n\nIn any shared living arrangement people are going to disagree about when something needs to be cleaned so it makes sense to agree on that. I'm not an expert in ADHD but it does result in executive disfunction so needing lists etc to ensure tasks get done is important. With the video you just inflamed the argument for no reason. I think you've really made a mountain out of a molehill by letting the stress build until it boiled over instead of intervening early.\n\nI would note the two tasks he does do regularly are obvious they need doing ie you can easily see when the grass is long and the fridge empty however seeing when bed sheets are dirty is far more difficult.\n\nJust give him a simple list of things you want him to do ie vacuum weekly, change beds weekly and he should be able to take care of the rest.", "Yeah you\u2019re the asshole", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you can\u2019t ask your partner to help you, who can you ask? OP could take an hour to sit down with him to create a list of chores they\u2019re each responsible for.

With bed sheets, he says because they\u2019re washed after a week as opposed to a daily chore, he forgets. But yeah, I suspect it is an excuse as well. \n\nI think I labeled it as misogyny because in trad households, women are responsible for the brunt of cleaning, especially deep cleaning.

They\u2019re regular and go by a rule of thumb that you can see online or any cleaning self help/blog post. Eg change the sheets once a week.

Patriarchy goes deep whether realized or not. \n\n-the video was about emotional labor and being the household manager and how that is work in and of itself.

It looks a lot like weaponised incompetence.", "This is typical for a person with ADHD. Have you educated yourself on this disorder?

When you mentioned the online schedule it sounded more like an example rather than something he should follow exactly, I expect it includes every chore so it would be good to decide on a split.\n\nIt sounds a bit like you both have some gaps in your communication. I think you could have been clearer with him earlier but also he should have asked for a schedule earlier. His ADHD may be a factor in this as the previous comments may not have fully registered, yes it's he who has it but you're both going to have to work with it for things to work.", "Precisely. There is no reason why he couldn't google a list of chores the way OP did in the end.\n\nThis is more than just ADHD, this is weaponized incompetence", "People with ADHD need things like schedules to ensure they do tasks otherwise they can get distracted and become hyper focussed on the wrong thing.  That doesn't mean OP needs to produce a detailed schedule, just a post it with a couple notes on it and then let him use the existing system he uses for work.", "I never said it was impossible. I do well at work and in school but by the time I get home I am so burned out from masking and I need help. That\u2019s why I have a cleaning service.", "I never said it couldn\u2019t be learned.

I said, would you expect a co worker to do your tasks because you forgot to do them? No way. So why is he not even treating me with the same respect as a damn co worker?", "I know these are typical issues for people with adhd. I\u2019ve listened to podcasts, read books, etc about adhd to help understand him more. Funnily enough, my therapist thinks I have adhd myself and wants me to be evaluated. \n\nThe real issue is not his adhd. The issue is how he is not using his strategies, therapy, and tools to address this problem. He is awesome at remembering birthdays and to pay bills and appointments because he sets reminders. He does great at work because of his calendars. Why is he not using those strategies for these tasks, especially when it is damaging our relationship?", "I\u2019m glad my clarifications left you speechless", "Thank you. \n\nWhile many jobs do and should offer accommodations, he does not use those in his workplace.

Why was I the one googling and sending him chore lists and schedules. He has a computer.", "So he can make a list. The fuck?", "People with adhd are not unable to learn how to manage this stuff themselves. They\u2019re not children nor are they stupid.

Therapy. Medication management.

Why does his tiredness mean he\u2019s no longer accountable for his own needs?", "And it\u2019s not fair, but it\u2019s his responsibility to learn instead of putting the work on others.", "Because you will wash his sheets and scrub the dunny bowl even if you\u2019re mad, cause you have to use the sheets and the toilet too.  his coworkers can and likely will tell him to go fuck himself and he has to deal with consequences.\n\nAsking you to make him a list is a quick and easy way to make the appearance of positive change without having to commit to any thinking, effort, self reflection, or further household chores.", "I\u2019ll tell you why. When he gets an alert that it\u2019s his friends birthday, it takes him ten second to drop what he\u2019s doing to send a happy birthday text. Same thing with paying bills. A calendar reminder isn\u2019t going to help him with cleaning because he probably won\u2019t be in a position to clean when the reminder comes through. \n\nFor example, let\u2019s say he sets the reminder for 9am on Saturday mornings. If he\u2019s eating breakfast or getting dressed when that reminder comes up, he\u2019s going to have to wait until he\u2019s finished to actually start cleaning. That leaves a lot room for a lot of other things to grab his attention and before he knows it, the day has gone by and he hasn\u2019t cleaned yet. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re not able to regulate your attention. \n\nAfter struggling with this very issue for years, I threw in a towel and hired a cleaning service and it\u2019s one of the best decisions I ever made. I have told my fianc\u00e9 that if he will taken the lead on light housekeeping (daily sweeping, making the bed etc.), I would pay for a cleaning service to come in every two weeks and do the deeper cleaning.

Maybe the discussion needs to start with agreeing on what the necessary frequency is for all these jobs, if you can reach a compromise there.

This is a weird post, because it's so ridiculously accurate, I needed to check whether  you were my wife (f33). I've (m33) been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 16. I also participate in making the bed, washing the dishes, cooking and taking the rubbish out. Weirdly enough, I too do the lawns and the grocery shopping. \n\nI thought I'd give you my perspective as it may be similar to your boyfriend's. The reason I  need a list is because I get overwhelmed when things seem endless. My life is based around a series of tasks that get me to the next day. That sounds dire, but it's how I cope. When I have a list, I have an end in sight. My wife and I write a list at the start of the weekend, we then work out who will do what (It takes 10 minutes in a Thursday night). I  then complete the tasks methodically. It may not be in the \"correct order\", and to be fair, it's usually done in short intensive bursts \u2013 but at the end of the weekend, 95% of the time, that list is completed. \n\nThe only downside is that my wife is incredibly proactive in terms of always finding new things to do. This will often send me into a spiral because it's thrown me off my plan of attack \u2013 which often leads to a fight.\n\nLazy is the most demotivating word in the world. Just because I don't do things the same way as my wife, doesn't mean I'm lazy. When I am left to my own devices, I thrive. I have a good career, I am able to get up early and go to the gym, and I do a lot of cooking. Being told I'm lazy makes me go into my shell and say fuck it. The whole joke around ADDers not being able to focus seems funny, but at this age, It's debilitating. I am anxious all the time because I can't stay on task (right now, I'm at work and having to shield my computer screen). I'm often thinking about the things I haven't done, feeling immense amounts of guilt and then burying my head in the sand because dealing with that guilt is such a monumental task, it feels temporarily easier not doing anything at all. This is my number one reason why I don't see all the little things she sees. I'm not thinking about the toilet or the mopping. It's out of sight, out of mind.\n\nIf this is such a big ongoing problem, sitting down and working out a solution for an hour seems like a small price to pay for a happier relationship. It's not saying that he doesn't need to put in the  effort, it's just that the reality is, he may never change his way of living. If you can find a way to help him help you, then why not invest in doing so? I get that it's frustrating, a lot of the time he's probably frustrated with himself, but it seems like a simple solve. \n\nTo be honest, I'd love to know how you get to a resolve. Because, although we are a little further down the line, I'm always trying to better ways of doing life with my wife!\n\nAnyway, that's my shitty ted talk. Thanks for reading.", "As someone with ADHD I have not once done the chores you\u2019re talking about in my house.

The whole point of the concept of neurodivergence is that people have different levels of ability and need in different areas/ skills, this will vary amongst people with adhd. Sounds like he\u2019s tried to tell you and you\u2019ve brushed it off in the heat of argument. I\u2019ve never encountered a neurodivergent person who lies about their needs; if anything they/we minimise our needs because our experiences have taught us that people don\u2019t listen, don\u2019t understand and will instead argue with us or make character judgements about us. If you understand what your partners needs are with regard to their adhd then you will know when they\u2019re using it as an excuse and when not. \n\nNon-adhd context specific: Sounds like you\u2019re not working well as a couple at the moment with making adjustments for each others needs about the home.

You probably need to work out how to have the conversation without it becoming an argument. Meet him halfway! Sounds like you\u2019ve already written the list in your head about which tasks need doing and at what frequency. Maybe share this with him. Agree a compromise on the frequencies the tasks need to be done so you meet in the middle. Together build your calendar with reminders (consider an alexa or something that will audibly remind you so the plan doesn\u2019t rely on someone having to remember to check the schedule). Do the plan. Trial it. Adjust and tweak it until you are both 75% happy with it. In general sounds like you\u2019re gonna have to lower your standards and him raise his.

Part of having ADHD means you have to acknowledge where it causes difficulties for you and make mitigations for them. Eg if you don\u2019t notice the bathroom needs cleaning, then you instead schedule time to clean it regardless.\n\nSure, it might mean you occasionally clean it before it really needs to be done, or another time it gets a bit mucky before you do it\u2026 but overall you\u2019ll at least be picking up your share of the housework and nothing will end up too far gone.

We have a really clean apartment to the point that when we get inspections, we always get praise for being the cleanest most organised apartment in our complex, further supported by us getting a renewal of our lease at lower than market rate because the owner is happy their property is well looked after.

There is literally no valid reason he can't apply those same exact strategies to the maintenance of household chores.\n\nAll of the tasks that OP is talking about are, at most, bi-monthly chores.

I\u2019ve tried to set myself reminders and it\u2019s extremely hard (I also can\u2019t take the meds). I\u2019m not saying your partner might not be being defensive and ashamed as part of this, but I do think he needs partnership on this one. ADHD can be a really serious health issue, and for me partnered with my other health issues it makes life extremely difficult. \n\nWork is different, it has different activity, different interest level, strategic deadlines\u2026I do okay in my job. I just want you to know that for me at least, if I could just do the thing, I would, and the amount of shame and self loathing I feel for not being able to just do the thing can be paralyzing. I applaud you for sitting down and working with him.", "Just to suggest a potential solution, perhaps you could continue doing more of the less frequent tasks, and he could take on an additional daily task or two?\n\nFor instance, you\u2019ll continue to do the sheets, baseboards, windows, etc., but he agrees to do the dishes. Sure, he won\u2019t spend two hours cleaning the windows at one time, but he\u2019ll spend 20 minutes doing the dishes every day.\n\nI\u2019m obviously not sure exactly what chores he would need to take on for a fair division of labor.\n\nOne thing to consider is that if one person has a much higher cleanliness standard, it might be on that person to take on a little more of the overall chore load. My wife and I have never washed the windows in our house. It\u2019s just not a priority for us. If I suddenly found it important, my wife might pitch in, but I\u2019m not sure it would be reasonable for me to expect her to spend an hour every week helping me wash the windows.\n\nI\u2019ll also mention that if you\u2019re responsible for maintenance/fixes at your home, whoever is doing that is taking on a pretty significant mental (and actual) load, so be sure to account for that in the chore division. It\u2019s easy to overlook because the need for it is sporadic, but when a toilet starts leaking or the refrigerator goes out and the next six hours are spent dealing with that, it\u2019s quite draining. It\u2019s unplanned, usually interrupts something else happening, and typically requires learning some new thing to solve the problem. Even finding a good repair person can be stressful.", "One other thing you can help that is likely at play in a work situation is that there\u2019s a \u201cdeadline\u201d aka \u201csheets washed and on the bed by 8 pm Sunday each week\u201d but there\u2019s not a requirement for how he meets that deadline. In a work setting he might have four assignments with different deadlines and cycle through depending on his ability to focus and the demand of the work. I struggled with this with my male ADHD partner because he would like strip the bed, but the sheets in washer. Walk away. Make himself breakfast. An hour later start the washer. And on and on. I would correct him and be like \u201care you doing the sheets or what\u201d and it caused bickering. With the deadlines, I say nothing until 8 pm Sunday when we agreed it would be done. If he wants to do it in pieces while he also does 3 other things in pieces rotating in a circle around our house, then that\u2019s that. It works for him. \n\nAlso, I see a lot of people bringing up different cleanliness standards and while I think that does come into play, I also encourage you to have an honest discussion with your boyfriend about how cleanliness impacts your collective well being. A lot of comments here are like \u201cwell he probably just didn\u2019t wash the shower before he lived with her and it doesn\u2019t matter to him so it\u2019s her issue.\u201d I have my own non ADHD mental illness with execution function issues and they\u2019re right, for a long time when I lived on my own I just didn\u2019t wash the shower. But that wasn\u2019t actually good at all. Baseboards may be a bit overboard but many of these things are biweekly and when I push myself to them I benefit. It is an act of care to myself to have a living space that\u2019s clean and welcoming. I bring up discussing this with him because he could be framing this as \u201csome useless thing that\u2019s hard for me and I don\u2019t notice\u201d which will add to the tension. \n\nAs a last note, you sound frustrated in your posts and comments and I sympathize and would guess at least a portion of this derives not from the chore itself but from his deflection and then outburst and then table turning. That is also very common in ADHD. I would encourage the two of you to open a dialogue about communication, maybe even with the help of a counselor with experience in ADHD. One first step you can try is asking him what he heard you say. You might have said \u201chey babe you said you\u2019d take care of the shower can you get that done? You forgot last week.\u201d And to you it was a reminder, mentioning it wasn\u2019t done last week to communicate it really needs to happen. He could very well be hearing that as \u201cthe thing you\u2019re doing right now is wrong because you need to be cleaning the shower and something\u2019s wrong with you that you\u2019re struggling to get up and do that.

While no, not all of the housework should fall on you, he had a good point in that if you give him a schedule, he can probably do it.
