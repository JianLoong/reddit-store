They got a dog last year, which they let roam freely on both sides. They used to come clean up after it and apologize, but did not build a fence or tie it up. My backyard is a 'naturalized area', which is allowed in my town, mostly a wildflower pollinator meadow, with a smaller grass area. The garden was already there when I moved in a few years ago. This neighbour used to come and mow down all my flowers, saying it's embarrassing to have his friends over and see them (separate issue). Now he says he 'has' to do it to find his dogs waste. My landlord used to live on the property, they never mowed the meadow when he lived there. My gate on the opposite side of the house from his was a bit loose, he came and installed an automatic gate closer on MY gate, so that my kids can't accidentally let his dog out. \n\nThe dog chews my kids toys, it ripped my back screen door, pees on my deck. In winter they started only coming to clean up the dog feces about once a week..they get buried in snow and can't be found. Eventually three weeks go by without anyone cleaning up. Once the wife saw the dog crap and she told me that she wasn't going to pick it up, her husband wanted a dog so he has to do it. He was at work. Finally I go to speak with them seriously, but they start yelling that 'he does so much work on my property', it's a 'shared yard' (it's not), 'they can't tell their dog what to do', that I need to build a door on my deck to keep the dog off of it, and I'm just lazy for not having a real lawn and leaving my kids toys outside. \n\nAt this point I feel an adult discussion is not going to happen so I called bylaw, and they are fining him a few hundred dollars every time the dog crosses the property line, and another fine if no one cleans up its waste. Now they are furious and told me that I 'started a war'. The landlord already offered a long time ago to pay for half the cost of a fence with them. AITA?
