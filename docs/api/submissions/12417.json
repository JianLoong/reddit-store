My landlord used to live on the property, they never mowed the meadow when he lived there.

Ugh, you sure we don't have the same neighbors?? I have floral and vegetable gardens all over my propy, my \"seasonal\" neighbors decided to get a dog. They come to their house from Memorial day through Labor Day every weekend, and some sporadic weeks here and there. It NEVER fails, the dog is in my yard, trampling my gardens, chasing my cat up the trees, and just completely obnoxious with barking non-stop. Keep sending them fines and if they want to get into \"war\" simply remind them that the cost of the fin s could have paid for the fence. Or do what I did, have a leash and harness delivered to their doorstep with a gift note, no one else wants pup to get hurt or picked up by the animal control officers, right?", "NTA They started the neighbor war and now you need to finish it. They are acting in a completely entitled and irresponsible manner. They have no right to trespass on your property, including the dog. I presume they are also breaking local laws by allowing their dog to roam off-leash in an un-fenced area. \n\nThey are not only being disrespectful to you, but creating a health and accident hazard for your children. They could catch illness from the dog waste or slip on it and injure themselves (which actually happened to another family's child according to a recent post in the forum).\n\nI addition to what you've already done, you may want to consult legal counsel to see if they can send a cease and desist letter and help you get a restraining order to keep them off your property. Hopefully they will determine that defying you will be too expensive and they will either build a fence or keep their dog leashed when outside.\n\nYour quality of life and enjoyment of your property shouldn't be diminished because they are too lazy to walk their dog or too cheap to build a fence around their yard for it.
