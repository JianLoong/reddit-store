Her parents used to work there. I have absolutely nothing against it and i love when she talks about her childhood. She left this country at 18 to go to college in France, however it seems she isn't over her childhood and still tries to live the same way, if that makes sense. She cooks only exotic dishes, often switch langages and uses foreign slangs, uses oriental make-up, even her house and furnitures have some kind of orientalistic vibe. \nIt makes me inconfortable because she is white, and very obviously european. For me its cultural apropriation. Im affraid people would take it the wrong way and start being mean to her. Ive met her parents and theyre very \"classical\" french parents, so i dont understand where her attitude is coming from. I tried to talk to her about it a few times and she just gave me a blank stare and is just ignoring me, looking sad. \n\nI want to know if AITA telling my girlfriend that her way of living is cultural appropriation ? I think i might be TA because this is her natural way of living as she was born and raised in a foreign country and i might have hurt her feelings telling her i think this is Indeed cultural appropriation\n\nEddit 1: Hi people of Reddit! I'm reading as much answers as i can and i realise that ive been a MASSIVE AH towards my girlfriend, and towards communities i didnt mean to offend. I'm also deeply ignorant. For context, my girlfriend grew up in Algeria. I was mostly afraid of people's reactions toward her because of the very sensitive topic of History between France and Algeria ( War and various atrocities in the 60s and before toward algerian people). Also we live in a very rural, very small village in France and i was afraid she would face racism from the people living here. I realise ive been the racist. Thank you for the reality check. I will try my best to educate myself to be a better person and towards her and others. Thank you people.\n\nEddit2: Also i would like to add that im not american, im european; in Europe\" oriental\" is a very common term used to speak about Arabic and middle eastern countries as well as asian countries and their cultures and it is not at all insulting for us, i was not trying to insult anyone.

For context, Marie is french, from French parents, but she was born and raised in a foreign country with Arabic/Muslim culture. Her parents used to work there. I have absolutely nothing against it and i love when she talks about her childhood. She left this country at 18 to go to college in France, however it seems she isn't over her childhood and still tries to live the same way, if that makes sense. She cooks only exotic dishes, often switch langages and uses foreign slangs, uses oriental make-up, even her house and furnitures have some king of orientalistic vibe. It makes me inconfortable because she is white, and very obviously european. For me its cultural apropriation. I've met her parents and theyre very \"classical\" french parents, so i dont understand where her attitude is coming from. I tried to talk to her about it a few times and she just gave me a blank state and is just ignoring me, looking sad. So tell me Reddit, AITA for telling her this is cultural appropriation ? Im affraid people would take it the wrong way and start being mean to her.\nI want to know if AITA telling my girlfriend that her way of living is cultural appropriation ? I think i might be TA because this is her natural way of living as she was born and raised in a foreign country and and i might have hurt her feelings telling her i think this is Indeed cultural appropriation\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
