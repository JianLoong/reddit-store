I\u2019m sure if the child was a stellar youth bowler he would have let her try.\nAlso the fact that his ball is balanced and was likely too heavy for her. And let\u2019s not talk about it the finger holes being drilled specifically for the bowlers grip. \n\nAnd for you college kids who think it\u2019s funny to throw the 6 pound ball down the lane and crack it, that was likely some youth bowlers favorite ball.
