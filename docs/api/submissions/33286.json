She utilized the medical system to become pregnant, and I helped choose the sperm donor. I was very excited for her, even though I\u2019m not generally a kid person. \n\n\r  \nSince she had her child, I\u2019ve been frustrated with some of her choices. This began at a college reunion, when her child was about 3 or 4 months old. My friend decided to bring her child with her, despite her parents offering to babysit. During the reunion, there was a semi-formal party. My friend had made a comment beforehand that there were no tickets available for children and so she was going to sneak her baby in. At the party, it was obvious that we were the only ones with a child and that it was way too loud for the baby. My friend then proceeded to go downstairs into a quieter space with her child which required us to rotate to spend time with them so she didn\u2019t feel lonely. I was disappointed because I wanted to spend time with my friends at the party and enjoy what we had paid for. I felt that if she was not willing to let someone else watch her child then she should not be coming to an event that was clearly not meant for children. \n\n\r  \nThe next morning, we went to a restaurant for breakfast, which another one of my friends had picked out. We got there early and I texted my friend to let her know there was no room for a stroller, which clearly upset her. She carried the baby in and proceeded to set up a sound machine in an attempt to get the baby to sleep, while in a crowded restaurant. It was very loud, and one friend was trying to get me to say someone to the friend with the child, which I tried to pass along. My friend snapped at me, saying \u201cI\u2019m trying to get my baby to sleep!\u201d I responded with something like, \u201cyou brought her into a crowded restaurant.\u201d She became a bit upset and said \u201cwould you rather we just not come?\u201d After I assured her I did want her there, we dropped it and I didn\u2019t think it was a major issue. \n\n\r  \nA couple days later she called me and told me that she needed me to not criticize her because she\u2019s having a hard enough time with being a single parent. Our conversation boiled down to me saying I didn\u2019t think it was fair to tell me I couldn\u2019t respond after she was rude to me. She responded with \u201cyou\u2019re breaking my heart right now.\u201d Her point of view is that I should just let it go and hope that she learned from that and wouldn\u2019t do it again. We eventually agreed to disagree, but I\u2019ve been very hurt ever since. And notably, she has not learned from the experience and has continued to bring her child to inappropriate events. IMO she expects that we drop everything to help her when she needs it and becomes very frustrated when we don\u2019t do exactly what she says even if there are alternatives that make sense. I\u2019ve almost entirely stopped talking to her and I feel like I\u2019ve lost my best friend. If I\u2019m the asshole, I\u2019d like to know so I can try to repair our relationship.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1702913476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lbg5s/aita_for_not_cutting_my_single_mother_friend_more/", "score": 485, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also told her that I disagreed with not being able to respond after she is rude to me, although I have made efforts to not make any criticizing statements afterwards. \n\nI might be the asshole because she is a single mother, which is inherently difficult. It must be hard to hear friends disagreeing with your decisions. I'm also a person who does not understand the biological drive to have children, and have some biases, believing that it's selfish to have children in today's day and age. I also become frustrated when people expect that their children have to come first in other adult's lives - I didn't choose to have the baby, she did.

Enjoy your time with other people and if she comes back at some point, decide then if you want to reestablish a relationship. The one you had is over.", "Nope - I\u2019m a mom of two and you only bring kids to kid friendly events , get a sitter or don\u2019t go. Your friend is being unrealistic and needs to find activities where other children are welcome.", "NTA. It sucks that she brought her baby to the reunion, that\u2019s inappropriate. I am also sorry she was rude to you. \n\nI will say I see her side too. I have a 5 month old and happily bring them most places with me. They sit on my lap and happily look at lights and glasses while at restaurants. I have a baby, but I am still a person deserving of socialization. I do not have a village. I can\u2019t just take my baby somewhere where they will be safe and cared for while I go have fun. I don\u2019t try and make my baby nap in loud restaurants, especially with a sound machine, but my baby will happily fall asleep on me in this situation. Not all babies will. \n\nYour friend is still a person deserving of socialization. Also please remember she likely isn\u2019t sleeping a lot and it\u2019s a lot of pressure to be a single parent, even if she chose it herself.", "I\u2019m the child of a single mother so I feel slightly qualified to speak on this. If there was a reunion that my mother wanted to go to but all her babysitting options fell through? She didn\u2019t go. It takes a village, yes, but you have to willingly sign up to be a villager. If my mom had any hint that she was inconveniencing her friends, she would\u2019ve rather missed out on events to avoid ruining other peoples time and foisting a child into an unwanted and inappropriate situation. It sounds like your friend may have thought she was going to be able to get a lot more help with her baby than she is currently and she\u2019s struggling but it\u2019s also not fair of her to assume you will all exist at her whims. She chose to be a parent and part of that journey means giving up some fun stuff if it\u2019s not in the best interests of her and the child.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend became a single mom at her own insistence. She does not get to hold everyone else or every other outing hostage for the sake of her choice.\n\nFurthermore, it seems that your friend hasn't come to terms with the fact that with her baby still being so young, it's not reasonable for her to bring baby along. For that, the remedy is not to invite her to outings you plan and don't be forced to become part of her care plan when she brings herself and baby to places where baby would have been better at home.\n\nWith the decision to have a child, your friend has essentially traded some freedoms for the joy and responsibility of parenthood. She just hasn't realized it yet and is being stubborn by not conceding the point that some things she wants to do--sometimes she can't. Some places she wants to go--sometimes she can't. That's the natural tradeoff when you become a parent, especially when she's not gotten comfortable with the idea of leaving the baby under anyone else's care.\n\nAlso, if no one else in your joint friend group currently has children, it's a little tone deaf not to consider that some people don't want to interact with a child if they don't have to. It just seems like your friend needs to get her priorities rearranged.", "NTA, she made it clear that her priority is to Never leave the kid to a babysitter no matter what the event.  This isn't something that Happened to her, this is something she actively CHOSE.  If she didn't do the research to figure out how hard it would be or worse is such an entitled person to expect the world to accomodate her POOR DECISION making and tries to pawn those off on others is she really that good of a friend?", "NTA. But you are letting her bully you. At the reunion, you should not have agreed to take turns watching the baby. Doing this only emboldens her to use you more. If you let people treat you like a doormat, WHEY WILL TREAT YOU LIKE A DOORMAT.", "Why does it feel like OP's friend had a child because they really wanted attention and didn't really want a child?", "Your friend is an ignorant selfish parent.", "She isn't even having to single parent alone, her parents offered to watch the child? Sounds to me like she is just pissed that you guys aren't more interested in parenting WITH her and she is using this kid like an accessory and for attention.", "Sounds like baby is an accessory. Is mom a good mom? Bc she sounds like a piece of work", "NTA.\n\n\n\nWhen I got out to meet my friends with my baby they offered me to take care of the baby and I can have fun. I never, never asked them to care my baby for me. It\u2019s my responsability and my choice to bring him to the meetings. In parties I take care of my baby when ny parents can\u2019t and generally I left early bcs I want to have a good time with my friends for a while.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s her responsability, not yours or any of your mutual friends.", "Info: why did her bringing the baby to a party require *you* to leave the party, exactly?", "I like OP saying the friend can just leave her kid at home when the kid is freaking 3 months old. Not only is it difficult emotionly to leave a 3yo alone, babies that age need milk every 2-3 hours, and the bottle is not always an option. Some babies hate it. So OP'S Friends can either choose to have no social life or bring the baby. BuT iT WaS hEr ChOiCe To HaVe A bAbY. What kind of friend are you? Be supportive. YTA", "NTA. \n\nStop being a doormat and stop helping her. She's the one who decided to get pregnant, not you. You're not responsible for her kid, but it seems she feels entitled to your help.\n\nIf you know she's going to bring her kid, maybe it's time to stop inviting her.", "You are absolutely NTA.  \nYour friend has no common sense and no respect for anyone. She is forcing everyone to put up with an infant in adult settings. You should let her stew in her own juices when things don't work out the way she expects. Why do you feel obligated to keep her company so she won't be lonely?   \nI really have no use for people who are so selfish and inconsiderate.", "NAH. You do not have your be the other parent to her child. She should not be bringing her child to formal events. \n\nHowever, I can empathize with her- literally, because I am a single mom to a 3.5 month old child. Is it possible she has PPD or PPA? The hormones and lack of sleep are doing a number on me and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve said/done things that I would never think of in my \u201cbefore\u201d life.", "She was just entitled when she was bringing the baby along to not kid friendly places. Bringing a sound machine into a restaurant is full on AH behavior. I\u2019m surprised management didn\u2019t kick her out.   NTA", "Alternately now you've heard nothing for 20 minutes except the sound machine some asshole brought to the restaurant.", "It's not that terrible. I'm from a country where there's plenty of children dining out with parents in restaurants..we're mostly ok. Not the most introvert of the European bunch. She just needs to let her parents babysit more and not treat friend as her co-parent. \n\nI'm against the white noise nonsense for a restaurant though. Kids can survive a bit of a noise. Especially kids you plan to take out and about. The moment they want to cry, you take your kid in your arms and you go for a bit of fresh air or to see the funny fishes in the entrance or smt", "Or just don\u2019t bring a baby to places that aren\u2019t family friendly. No one needs to \u201cgrow up\u201d because you or some entitled heifer decided to become a single mom on purpose. Ridiculous.", "The hardest job THAT SHE CHOSE. There are places that babies should not be, she had an option for a babysitter, she should not have brought the baby and expected everyone to accommodate her", "Yeah this is insane that she has supportive parents and still chooses to subject her baby and friends to very unsuitable circumstances", "Declared the Reddit stranger.", "Since when do people not take their babies to restaurants?", "Since they have common sense. Wtf is a few months old baby gonna do at a restaurant other that scream and disturb everyone else??"]}
