She utilized the medical system to become pregnant, and I helped choose the sperm donor. I was very excited for her, even though I\u2019m not generally a kid person. \n\n\r  \nSince she had her child, I\u2019ve been frustrated with some of her choices. This began at a college reunion, when her child was about 3 or 4 months old. My friend decided to bring her child with her, despite her parents offering to babysit. During the reunion, there was a semi-formal party. My friend had made a comment beforehand that there were no tickets available for children and so she was going to sneak her baby in. At the party, it was obvious that we were the only ones with a child and that it was way too loud for the baby. My friend then proceeded to go downstairs into a quieter space with her child which required us to rotate to spend time with them so she didn\u2019t feel lonely. I was disappointed because I wanted to spend time with my friends at the party and enjoy what we had paid for. I felt that if she was not willing to let someone else watch her child then she should not be coming to an event that was clearly not meant for children. \n\n\r  \nThe next morning, we went to a restaurant for breakfast, which another one of my friends had picked out. We got there early and I texted my friend to let her know there was no room for a stroller, which clearly upset her. She carried the baby in and proceeded to set up a sound machine in an attempt to get the baby to sleep, while in a crowded restaurant. It was very loud, and one friend was trying to get me to say someone to the friend with the child, which I tried to pass along. My friend snapped at me, saying \u201cI\u2019m trying to get my baby to sleep!\u201d I responded with something like, \u201cyou brought her into a crowded restaurant.\u201d She became a bit upset and said \u201cwould you rather we just not come?\u201d After I assured her I did want her there, we dropped it and I didn\u2019t think it was a major issue. \n\n\r  \nA couple days later she called me and told me that she needed me to not criticize her because she\u2019s having a hard enough time with being a single parent. Our conversation boiled down to me saying I didn\u2019t think it was fair to tell me I couldn\u2019t respond after she was rude to me. She responded with \u201cyou\u2019re breaking my heart right now.\u201d Her point of view is that I should just let it go and hope that she learned from that and wouldn\u2019t do it again. We eventually agreed to disagree, but I\u2019ve been very hurt ever since. And notably, she has not learned from the experience and has continued to bring her child to inappropriate events. IMO she expects that we drop everything to help her when she needs it and becomes very frustrated when we don\u2019t do exactly what she says even if there are alternatives that make sense. I\u2019ve almost entirely stopped talking to her and I feel like I\u2019ve lost my best friend. If I\u2019m the asshole, I\u2019d like to know so I can try to repair our relationship.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1702913476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lbg5s/aita_for_not_cutting_my_single_mother_friend_more/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also told her that I disagreed with not being able to respond after she is rude to me, although I have made efforts to not make any criticizing statements afterwards. \n\nI might be the asshole because she is a single mother, which is inherently difficult. It must be hard to hear friends disagreeing with your decisions. I'm also a person who does not understand the biological drive to have children, and have some biases, believing that it's selfish to have children in today's day and age. I also become frustrated when people expect that their children have to come first in other adult's lives - I didn't choose to have the baby, she did. So maybe I'm just being difficult and stubborn and unwilling to cut her some needed slack.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Bringing a sound machine to a restaurant literally made me lol, restaurants have plenty of white noise.  \n\nThe difference for her is she doesn\u2019t have a co-parent to be on her team when she is going through this stage of trying to figure out how to raise a human, which admittedly can be pretty stressful, especially if you haven\u2019t spent much time around babies.  \n\nYou guys are her friends and I\u2019m sure she considers you her support system, but none of you made the choice to have a baby, she did.  And shes asking you to accommodate wants, not needs.  She didn\u2019t need to bring her baby to the reunion and she didn\u2019t need to bring her baby to the restaurant.  Especially during their nap time!\n\nYou need to decide what kind of accommodations you are willing to make, if any, and then stick to it.

If spending time with her is not pleasant, because she insists on bringing her child, then you can make a choice and not spend time with her, or, let her know that she's welcome if she can arrange childcare. It sounds like she's not without resources, and she continues to make the choice to bring her child, which means she doesn't NEED to bring the baby, it's intentional.", "Nta she choose to have a kid.  Even if she *wasn't* a single parent, she wouldn't get to bring her kid to obviously not child friendly events.  \n\nShe can 1- leave the kid with a babysitter or 2 - not come.  Those are her only options.", "NTA. Parenting is one of the hardest things I've ever done, especially when my daughter was a baby. But I was still kind and courteous to my friends. If she can't separate from her baby, then she needs to bow out of events that aren't meant for kids. Tons of us parents have had to miss out on cool things, but that's parenthood and it gets better. \n\nBut you also need to set boundaries so you don't let your resentment grow and so you let your friend know what you will and won't accept. Boundaries don't need to be this big, mean ultimatum either. You can just kindly state your case and leave it at that.\n\n>My friend then proceeded to go downstairs into a quieter space with her child which required us to rotate to spend time with them so she didn\u2019t feel lonely.\n\nFor example, I would not have continually gone downstairs to hang out with her. She chose to bring her baby to an inappropriate event and because of this choice, she had to sequester herself. I maybe would have gone down for the first 10 minutes to help her get settled, then said, \"Alright, I'm going to go upstairs to enjoy the party. I'll see you tomorrow for breakfast?\"", "Life changes after you commit to raising another human being. Your friend needs to come to terms with this. Children aren\u2019t accessories. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA\n\n But stop enabling her. If she brings her kid  let her deal with her kid and you and the other friends enjoy your evening.", "NTA. It sounds like she's having a hard time giving up her childless-life. She clearly wants to attend all the events and meals, etc. But it's just not possible with a baby all the time. She needs to say no if it's a bad day for the baby or get a sitter.", "NTA she is being one to her child though. Poor little thing must be so overwhelmed and over stimulated when it's mother keeps dragging it places", "In the case that she isn't just entitled and delusional, I wonder if she's having some separation issues. Of course, if it were me and I couldn't bear to leave my baby with someone, I would probably take a pass on the outings and become a hermit, but I'm terrified of inconveniencing people.\n\nIf you do end up talking this out with her, it might be worth asking WHY she feels she must have baby with her/can't leave it with her parents for a few hours. If she has rational concerns about her parents as caregivers, or irrational anxiety about letting anyone else hold baby, it might give you a foothold tk work from. Maybe frame time apart as something good for both baby (bonding with grandparents) and her (reconnecting with the things she enjoys).\n\nYou know her better than I, obviously, but perhaps keep an eye out for signs of Post-Partum Depression/Anxiety.", "I wish I could say what I want to about your friend, but I\u2019d get banned from this sub again. \n\nNTA.
