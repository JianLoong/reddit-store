She utilized the medical system to become pregnant, and I helped choose the sperm donor. I was very excited for her, even though I\u2019m not generally a kid person. \n\n\r  \nSince she had her child, I\u2019ve been frustrated with some of her choices. This began at a college reunion, when her child was about 3 or 4 months old. My friend decided to bring her child with her, despite her parents offering to babysit. During the reunion, there was a semi-formal party. My friend had made a comment beforehand that there were no tickets available for children and so she was going to sneak her baby in. At the party, it was obvious that we were the only ones with a child and that it was way too loud for the baby. My friend then proceeded to go downstairs into a quieter space with her child which required us to rotate to spend time with them so she didn\u2019t feel lonely. I was disappointed because I wanted to spend time with my friends at the party and enjoy what we had paid for. I felt that if she was not willing to let someone else watch her child then she should not be coming to an event that was clearly not meant for children. \n\n\r  \nThe next morning, we went to a restaurant for breakfast, which another one of my friends had picked out. We got there early and I texted my friend to let her know there was no room for a stroller, which clearly upset her. She carried the baby in and proceeded to set up a sound machine in an attempt to get the baby to sleep, while in a crowded restaurant. It was very loud, and one friend was trying to get me to say someone to the friend with the child, which I tried to pass along. My friend snapped at me, saying \u201cI\u2019m trying to get my baby to sleep!\u201d I responded with something like, \u201cyou brought her into a crowded restaurant.\u201d She became a bit upset and said \u201cwould you rather we just not come?\u201d After I assured her I did want her there, we dropped it and I didn\u2019t think it was a major issue. \n\n\r  \nA couple days later she called me and told me that she needed me to not criticize her because she\u2019s having a hard enough time with being a single parent. Our conversation boiled down to me saying I didn\u2019t think it was fair to tell me I couldn\u2019t respond after she was rude to me. She responded with \u201cyou\u2019re breaking my heart right now.\u201d Her point of view is that I should just let it go and hope that she learned from that and wouldn\u2019t do it again. We eventually agreed to disagree, but I\u2019ve been very hurt ever since. And notably, she has not learned from the experience and has continued to bring her child to inappropriate events. IMO she expects that we drop everything to help her when she needs it and becomes very frustrated when we don\u2019t do exactly what she says even if there are alternatives that make sense. I\u2019ve almost entirely stopped talking to her and I feel like I\u2019ve lost my best friend. If I\u2019m the asshole, I\u2019d like to know so I can try to repair our relationship.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1702913476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18lbg5s/aita_for_not_cutting_my_single_mother_friend_more/", "score": 661, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I also told her that I disagreed with not being able to respond after she is rude to me, although I have made efforts to not make any criticizing statements afterwards. \n\nI might be the asshole because she is a single mother, which is inherently difficult. It must be hard to hear friends disagreeing with your decisions. I'm also a person who does not understand the biological drive to have children, and have some biases, believing that it's selfish to have children in today's day and age. I also become frustrated when people expect that their children have to come first in other adult's lives - I didn't choose to have the baby, she did.

If my mom had any hint that she was inconveniencing her friends, she would\u2019ve rather missed out on events to avoid ruining other peoples time and foisting a child into an unwanted and inappropriate situation. It sounds like your friend may have thought she was going to be able to get a lot more help with her baby than she is currently and she\u2019s struggling but it\u2019s also not fair of her to assume you will all exist at her whims.

For that, the remedy is not to invite her to outings you plan and don't be forced to become part of her care plan when she brings herself and baby to places where baby would have been better at home.\n\nWith the decision to have a child, your friend has essentially traded some freedoms for the joy and responsibility of parenthood. She just hasn't realized it yet and is being stubborn by not conceding the point that some things she wants to do--sometimes she can't. Some places she wants to go--sometimes she can't. That's the natural tradeoff when you become a parent, especially when she's not gotten comfortable with the idea of leaving the baby under anyone else's care.\n\nAlso, if no one else in your joint friend group currently has children, it's a little tone deaf not to consider that some people don't want to interact with a child if they don't have to.

It will get better soon, but she'd probably feel a lot less lonely and excluded if the group could choose places that she felt less invasive in. A lot of people are saying she wants everyone to accommodate hr, but honestly it sounds more like she's trying her damndest to accommodate herself in their lives but they're not really considering that a good friend's circumstances are very different now and it would be thoughtful to choose more baby-friendly places whenever possible.", "NTA.\n\nYour friend decided to be a single parent.

That\u2019s something for you to reflect on for yourself. To salvage it, if that\u2019s what you want, you\u2019ll probably need some professional insight/support. \n2) Hormones do not rebalance for like 2 years after pregnancy, which means your friend is likely adapting to parenthood in the middle of an absolute mental-emotional hurricane. Even if she did not give birth, there are hormonal changes that happen and it\u2019s still a massive shift to a different lifestyle that affects the whole person. \n3) It sounds like she underestimated the degree to which life changes with a newborn, overestimated the degree to which other people are willing to take on her responsibilities, and is not self aware enough to see how her thinking impacts the people around her. That\u2019s on her. \n4) I hope she factored childcare and support system (other than you) into her choice to become a parent because it\u2019s a MASSIVE barrier for women. Ignoring it isn\u2019t the solution. \n5) Single parent by choice or not, it\u2019s a hard path. Yes, she reaps what she sows and will need to be accountable for her life. Meanwhile, there is a child involved who did not choose any of the circumstances. It doesn\u2019t really matter to that baby how it\u2019s mom became a single mom. \nI believe in personal responsibility and I also believe in community care. More than anything, the baby needs a well-supported, consistent, healthy parent who doesn\u2019t parent out of fear, anxiety, trauma, or expectations. All children need that. And whether people like it or not, that means a robust support system, practical care, and *relationships that do not enable her unhealthy behavior but instead require her to be a whole, functional person*. Family trauma begets more trauma. It sounds like you are in the process of redefining what support means and that is good. It would have been better if it didn\u2019t come out of frustration in the moment, but such is life. It would be better if she didn\u2019t act entitled to remaining unchallenged, but such is life. \n\nFor all your sakes, especially that baby, I hope you\u2019re all able to work it out.

When you hang out with your friend pick child friendly places and age-appropriate activities for her and her baby. If you want to go do adult things, invite friends who will leave their children at home and come do adult things with you. If your friend brings it up say you are happy to plan more adult things with her if she can come alone but that if baby is coming you\u2019d prefer to do things that are enjoyable for baby (or at least, not stressful). Stop dropping everything to help her.

She didn't want a kid, she wanted a pretty accessory she could show off. As the child ages, she's going to be less and less interested, because she won't get the attention any more.
