You ignored the major red flags and now you are paying for it", "YTA because his behavior already has shown you exactly what he thinks if you and your kids.  YTA because you married this man and forced him into your children\u2019s lives.  YWBTA if you don\u2019t divorce him immediately.  Your kids deserve better and your husband isn\u2019t the only one that has failed them.", "YTA because you're still married to this guy. You've already left him TWICE in a year and went back to him twice due this behavior? Why?\n\nThis isn't a \"distant\" relationship with your children. He actively sets up situations to disrespect and control them.  This is an abusive situation towards your children, and you're letting your children continue to be abused by him by going back to him.", "YTA\n\nDemanding that your husband respect your children is not enough. You need to leave this man. He is toxic and horrible for your children.\n\nYOU are being a huge asshole to your kids by keeping this man in their lives. Shame.", "I assume that \"soon X\" means you're leaving this asshole. Good luck, take care of your kids and yourself first. He's the asshole, not you", "NTA but in hindsight you probably should have taken into consideration how he treated your kids before marrying him.", "\"We have separated twice because he doesn\u2019t respect me or my kids.\"\n\n3rd time should be final one.   Please move on", "NTA. But Y W B T A if you stay with this person. \n\nWhy would you marry this person in the first place if he has a history of being a terrible parent?

It appears that your husband has consistently demonstrated a lack of care for the needs of others and has not set a positive example for your younger children. The best decision for you is to keep the door firmly closed on his superiority complex if you believe that he will continue to make the same mistakes.

And why go back to someone who you claim disrespected you and your kids?\n\nHim, because he's rude, entitled, abusive. narcissistic and a liar. To act that way towards you and your kids is uncalled for. Especially your oldest, since she's always sharing with him and buying food for him specifically. My gosh.
