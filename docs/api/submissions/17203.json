I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole, they may have done it for a not so good reason, but I think that you still made the initial decision to do dinner and that counts more than picking up the bill which you had obviously already planned on doing.

I'm sure when they are teens or adults, all I will need is some time together", "I agree. I don't actually understand why she didn't talk to her sister before and ask if she wanted to go half. After all it's for mothers day and the mum is both their mothers.  After a certain age that's all mothers really want, a nice dinner with their kids (and if you are my mum, we have never fine anything)", "In a group setting, if there\u2019s ever a question I usually catch the server\u2019s attention on the DL and motion to give me the check, or if the opportunity is there I will excuse myself to go to the bathroom and if I pass the server I\u2019ll ask them to make sure I get the check.\n\nMy sister\u2019s type A husband makes a lot of money and is super quick to grab checks and we eat out together a lot so I\u2019ve learned this tactic.\n\nWorse case I also throw my card in and say \u201csplit it 50/50, I insist\u201d which usually gets me a \u201cbut you shouldn\u2019t pay for my kids\u201d and I say \u201cyou mean my nephews??\u201d", "Agreed. Mom doesn\u2019t care about gifts or who pays for lunch. Bickering about this is really childish.", ">ESH - Listen to what your Mom is saying to you. She doesn't care about gifts!\n\nThis.\n\nIt doesn't feel like OP wanted his mum to have a nice time, it sounds like they wanted the endorphin hit from believing they had been nice.", "Exactly! OP, listen to your mom FFS! She\u2019s not \u201crepeatedly insisting\u201d she doesn\u2019t want gifts to make your life difficult. She. Doesn\u2019t. Want. Them. \n\nWhen she asked you to invite your sister and BIL to this meal, why do you think that was? To create a chance for all of you to jockey for position? Or because she literally wanted to enjoy the company of her children? YOU ALL robbed yourselves of the chance to give her that. Spend the time with her. That\u2019s all she cares about. Make it pleasant. Stop worrying about who gets the credit. \n\nESH except Mom.", "Yeah, that's basically my stance too. Being upset about it is fine, but don't argue about it in front of your mother when she doesn't care and was having a good time. Her being happy is supposed to be the point.", ">How in the fuck is she going to take her out for lunch on some other day when her mom doesn't want to fucking go??\n\nIm pretty sure this was more of a \"dont BUY me anything son/daughter\" beacuse she can buy it herself, and a dinner (or supper/breakfast) was accepted as a gift beacuse its an opertunity to meet up and hang.\nIm sure the mom would love to meet up for dinner with her kids any other day of the week.\n\n>Parents walking all over one kid just to keep peace for themselves is bullshit. Fuck all that.\n\nIm pretty sure that the mother doesnt mind who is paying for dinner and she says its fine just so her kids wont fight over something silly. OP was probably hurt by this move (which was a bit of a shity move) more then the mom cares and OP is the one that puted emphasis on this, not the mom. The mother definetly didnt walk all over OP just to keep the peace.", "I mean she quite literally said in the post that her mother usually denies requests to be treated and it took a while to convince her mom to go out for this one.", "You are right. Thank you for your perspective.", "Great idea!  I\u2019ll book pedis for next weekend!", "i mean she said she\u2019s been trying & the mom just *finally* agreed to let her treat on this oneee occasion. and then bil & sis step in. i\u2019d be pissed too.", "Your brother's an ass", "But Mom asked her to invite them - clearly what she wanted for Mothers Day was a nice meal with her kids which OP gave her by organizing", "Yes, not to mention that seeing her kids argue over something petty is probably the last thing she wanted to do on Mother's Day.", "This is the one. Yelling at the people who treated you to lunch (and then following up continuing to be ungracious) is AH territory.", "But OP had to convince the mom for a long time to go out on the initial one? It probably wouldn\u2019t be easy to convince her mom to be treated to a meal on a completely random day, if she was so opposed to it on a holiday. \n\nThe mom is also the one who asked OP to invite her sister along. Was OP supposed to just say no?", "When people steal your thunder, it sucks. People are not assholes for having feelings. \n\nThe sister and her hubby are jerks for not discussing things on an event they were invited to with the event organizer.\n\nMom wanted both kids.

Absolutely despise them.\n\nHowever I understand gift giving is something that is not just for the receiver in an ideal gift giving situation it is just as much about the giver.  So I concede, I make cheap lists of stuff that I would like but I would never spend money on.  I don't make a fuss saying don't buy me anything.  \n\nShe is creating this situation to where the only thing she will accept is a meal and now her kids have to fight over who gets to give her the only gift she will accept.  Whomever gets the card out first wins mothers day for the year.", "This. Mom was as much of an AH as sis and bil.  You, OP are NTA.", "Let them pay, silly. Mom really doesn\u2019t care so why make it a big deal. Free meal! Mom wants to make sure that one day when she is not around, you all will be nice to each other. Give her that, even if it is a ruse.", "OP was upset, and her mom told her to say, \"Thank you.\"\nReally?? Parents don't have to respect their kids like they would respect any other human?

Thank you for doing the exact thing I didn't want you to do \ud83d\ude44\n\nLike I said, there's a person who's right and the other one. \n\nHow are you pretty sure?? She said she had to talk her into going.

I shall use this in the future!", "Oh so petty, and I'm here for it. Depending on my mood, I might just post this if I were OP. But you're right, it is just as fun imagining doing it.
