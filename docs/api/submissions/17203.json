I don\u2019t think anyone is the asshole, they may have done it for a not so good reason, but I think that you still made the initial decision to do dinner and that counts more than picking up the bill which you had obviously already planned on doing.

Older sis is still irrationally pissed I, a 36 year old woman, moved out. No one was ready/prepared to have dinner, they were all purposely making my sane sister and I wait and I have never liked family gatherings in that living room because it drives my allergies bonkers. They also all live there so they can occupy themselves with their laptops and whatnot. The level of no effs to give about other folks comfort is staggering and I'm so over it.\n\nNext time, do not invite sister and BIL.

Next time they get somebody something huge and/or expensive tell the person it was from you.", "NTA.

Is there more context? Do you make less then your sister or did they want to say they got your mother something?

You shouldn't have made an issue of it in front of your mom.", "No one is the asshole. Easily.", "The gift mom wanted was peaceful family togetherness.

That was what OP had to convince her of\u2026 unless I missed something, I didn\u2019t see anything about her not wanting to meet for dinner in general\u2014just that she was finally convinced to let OP pay. From what I understand, that is specifically what made the occasion special.", "I mean\u2026 the mom literally wanted nothing. And then OP convinced her to let her get her something. And then BIL & sis stole it, and left OP without an actual gift. That\u2019s literally what happened.\n\nI feel like we\u2019re going in circles here, bc at the end of the day I strongly feel like when someone gives me a present, their emotions about the gift are just as important as mine. Not liking a gift is one thing, but OP\u2019s mom had actually accepted it. \n\nIf someone gives me something, or asks if they can give me something, then I would reasonably conclude that the present meant a lot to that person *too*.

Even the worst one. That stopped when I was 14 but the rest continued until I moved out. \n\nA \u201cnice day where we all get along\u201d would be him trying to provoke reactions from via reminiscing of the times he beat me up, cursed me out, tickled me until I pissed myself, etc. You know. The greatest hits. \n\nIf I get upset or emotional I\u2019m told to get over it, it was years ago, it was \u201charmless\u201d childish fun. \n\nI tried to swallow it down and finally couldn\u2019t. I\u2019m very low contact with my mother. \n\nJust mind how much shit you ask one kid to swallow for one nice day together. You may get that one day and no more, just like my mom. \n\nThis isn\u2019t aimed directly at you, friend, but at the parents who frequently put their comfort and image of family above what they actually have for family and want that perfect image for one day.", "Except it clearly states the sister was in on it as well.

Done. Now you\u2019ve both paid.\n\nI literally cannot fathom why OP and her sister wouldn\u2019t have just split the meal and had it be a gift from both of them. Is there some difficulty outside of not wanting to share?", "Seriously, some people like to play holier than thou so hard here. Stole ops gift, they made a deal out of it instead of understanding ops effort. It's always the person who didn't do any wrong that needs to be the \"bigger person\" with these sorts of people. At least you have some sense.", "OP did all the work to convince mom to come out, find a time and restaurant that works for everyone, and was thoughtful enough to think of it to begin with. But to you the real \u201cmagic\u201d of the gift is the action of pulling out a credit card. The most shallow, meaningless part of the gift. Hard disagree. You, and apparently OP, don\u2019t understand the real value of what happened here.", ">I mean\u2026 the mom literally wanted nothing. And then OP convinced her to let her get her something. And then BIL & sis stole it, and left OP without an actual gift. That\u2019s literally what happened.\n\nThe mom wanted them there, that was the important part for her, not who's treating whom. And if you have to wear someone down to accept your gift, who is it really for? The saying \"it's the thought that counts\" doesn't just exist to justify cheap gifts, it also exists to condemn thoughtless gifts.", "How exactly was the thoughtful gesture ruined? Mom knows OP planned it. It was mom's idea to invite sis and BIL, so it's obvious it was planned beforehand. It's only ruined if OP lets it be ruined by staying mad.", "Now that they are adults, my kids get along great. We went through a devastating loss and they know that family is who was there to support them and love them. I know I am lucky that my kids actually enjoy each other\u2019s company now. There was a time that I didn\u2019t think it could happen.", "We don't. OP never specified their gender.", "That is the piece that upset me the most too.", "But it\u2019s OP\u2019s mom\u2019s day.

At the end of the day, it's about OP planning something for their mother and having it taken from them. OP should re-evaluate what they include their sister and BIL in, even at the request of their mother.", "You absolutely and completely missed my point. The mom DOES go out with them. SHE JUST DOESN\u2019t LET THEM PAY. So the magic I was referring to was *convincing the mom to let her pay*, convincing the mom to let OP give her this gift in the first place.\n\nAnd\u2014I literally didn\u2019t even use the words pay. I used the word \u201ctreat\u201d, very intentionally, because that\u2019s what it was about. OP wanted to treat her mom, and to OP the significant portion of that was paying. Perhaps because they go out to dinner often, and she wanted to give more then just her time. \n\nMaybe \u201cgetting the evening together\u201d took about 3 minutes to organize a reservation. Maybe OP does that all the time, and doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s any sort of a gift at all\u2014and now her sis/BIL are in the position of actually being the only ones to have done something \u201cspecial\u201d. \n\nI truly don\u2019t understand why so many here are dismissing the fact that the giver\u2019s emotions *also* matter. And the mom accepted! I can\u2019t imagine how exciting that would be. Considering how much all of it meant to OP, ofc it would suck to end up feeling like you didn\u2019t actually do much.", "It's a sweet sentiment but they still stole OP's thunder and have proven they don't give a fuck about his feelings. Sure OP can let the huge insult go but it will also happen again and again. How many times can you swallow that before bursting? \n\nFor OP NTA.", "What If the the family was shopping, OP asked her mother to select something OP could buy her as a gift, then BIL and sister swooped in at the cash register, stepped in front of OP and insisted on paying for it?  Would you still say OP shouldn\u2019t feel irritated? \n\nThis scenario at the restaurant is actually worse, since OP arranged it and BIL/sis were invited by OP.  At the very LEAST, they should have asked OP\u2019s permission to split the bill.", "She wanted to pay for something. She came up with the meal to be able to pay. Then sis  and BIL stole it by blocking her ability to pay. Which was her whole point. What part of that don\u2019t you understand?", "Why does that part piss you off the most? I think mom was just trying to keep her Mother\u2019s Day from being ruined. And while OP was justifiably upset, if they continued to push it, it likely would have ruined it for mom. I bet mom appreciates the gesture far more than BIL and sister\u2019s stunt.", "Idk, I can only speak for myself, but part of me would be relieved. Whew! Someone else picked up the tab, nice. But, my relationship with my mother/family isn't built on who spends what for someone else, so this wouldn't ever be a big issue for my family.", "It's emotionally manipulative.", "So if you planned something or gave a gift and another person took credit for it ( not the same but similar) you'd be fine with it? And again I'm sure you'll argue but it's not the same, no, but it's an example not using money with a very similar scenario and I'm curious would you be cool with that. Cuz basically it's someone else stealing your thunder it doesn't have to do with the money.", "I mean, that's totally dependent on my relationship with person. If they knew I organized and planned it, but someone else hijacked paying the bill, yeah, I wouldn't have a problem with that at all. Because the monetary expense isn't the important part, it's the thought and effort that count.\n\nIf my BIL did something like this, I'd just laugh. Ok! You pay! No skin off my back.", "NTA, but I think you won here anyway. \n\nYou planned and took your mom out, and hopefully she got that. \n\nThat the sis and BIL paid means that you got the joy of planning to take her out and did so, AND didn't have to actually pay. \n\nI see that as a win.", "NTA. Your BIL is a glory hound and your sister is drama llama. Next time leave the menagerie at home and enjoy time with your mom!", "NTA. Take her out again, just the 2 of you.", "This is such an extremely childish take. The Mother just wanted to have a nice pleasant meal with her children, it doesn't matter at all who pays for it. Fighting over who takes the \"credit\" is just immensely petty and pathetic. \n\nThis is often why parents don't want any gifts from their children, it sometimes just devolves into a meaningless sibling rivalry over who \"treats\" their parent better.", "This is what mom would want for sure.", "100%. I feel so bad for OP's mom and secondhand embarrassment for OP. Imagine all the kids getting together to go to lunch for mothers day and they throw a temper tantrum because their gift was 'hijacked'. At least be adult enough to address the issue in private and away from mom.  \n\nThey took this 'gift' and made it all about them and monetary value. I think I can kinda see why mom doesn't want them to buy anything. She knows it's just gonna cause fighting and competition between her kids.", "> It's always the person who didn't do any wrong that needs to be the \"bigger person\" with these sorts of people.\n\nWell duh, how can the person who did something wrong be the bigger person. In the long run  people being the bigger person is noticed by others and everyone see who the assholes are. Or hey just sink to the lower level and people will notice this too.", "You must live in some happy lala land. If mom just wants to keep the peace then that's what's going to keep happening no matter what crappy people do."]}
