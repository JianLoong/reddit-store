This is so infuriating.  My mom used to do this all the time.  She's ask what I'm getting brother, sister, my kids, my dad, etc for some holiday; then go out and buy it herself to give to them early.  Then act all clueless with \"but you hadn't bought it yet.\"  Stop telling sis what you plan to do.", "Take out mom again, without them.\n\nNTA", "NTA- they didn\u2019t get her anything and stole your gift.", "*I told you this was my Mother\u2019s Day gift and I invited you.\u201d*\n\n*mom says \u201cJust say thank you\u201d*\n\nYou invited them along out of courtesy, then they took your gift to your mum and made it about them, leaving you gift less and in a position that you needed to thank them!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nNext year Refuse to invite them", "NTA for being upset with them. They were insensitive. But speaking as a mom, I think Mothers Day is special not because of the day itself, but because it's one of the only times we get to hear how much we mean to our kids. I think you taking your mom out for a meal would be special to her any day of the year. It doesn't need to be limited to just one day. But maybe for next Mothers Day, don't invite anyone else.", "NTA but also not a huge deal... Take her out again. Also hope you all didn't argue about it in front of the server while they were waiting for you cause that's annoying.", "ESH - Listen to what your Mom is saying to you. She doesn't care about gifts!   \n\n\nYou sister and BIL are AH for taking over your gift, but you're also the AH for arguing about it in front of your Mom. All your Mom wanted was a nice day with her family and ended up with squabbling on her day.", "NTA\n\nThey took your gift that you had planned for your mother.  It feels awful.  This would frustrate me to no end.\n\nThe next time you want to treat you mother, tell her sis and BIL will not be invited.", "Was going to say everyone sucks but landed on YTA. The gift to your mother is the quality time and nice meal. Obviously she prefers both of her kids being present as she asked you to invite them. She doesn\u2019t care who paid and certainly isn\u2019t keeping score. I guess you can argue they should have respected your wish to pay, but they also ate 2/4 meals and insisted on being fair/generous. You lost nothing by them paying. Just say thank you. You were as ungracious as you\u2019re trying to accuse them of being. Grow up and stop making an issue where there isn\u2019t one.", "ESH (except Mom), it is not a competition and a mothers day gift/treat doesnt have to be on the exact day. Many people celebrate things on different days due to work/sickness etc. \n\nIve celebrated christmas a week before and a week after in some years due to work and people do things on a weekend when the 'holiday' is during the week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake your Mom out somewhere nice another day.", "Life is too short for this level of pettiness. \n\nBe glad your mother had her day with her kids.  \n\nYATA", "ESH. Them obviously, and you for making it into a scene. In the interest of keeping things pleasant for your mom you should have let it go.", "ESH. This is crazy. The gift is getting to spend time with her kids, not the dinner itself. It doesn't matter who paid. If it's so important to pay for a meal take her to dinner or lunch another day.", "YTA. Your mom is happy and you planned the thing. Who cares who paid.", "ESH.\n\nUhm, how old are all of you again? Does it matter who pays as long as your mom enjoyed herself in the company of her daughters?", "YTA. I bet your Mom really appreciated her daughters getting into a stupid fight about who paid.\n\nIt was meant to be about her, not you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
