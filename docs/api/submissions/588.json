One of which used to be my sisters (21) until she moved out of the house one day suddenly, effectively abandoning him. That was almost a year ago, and I\u2019ve been taking care of and loving him since then with very little financial help from her, only around $100. \n\nSince he\u2019s been with me he\u2019s a lot happier and extremely loving when he used to be a complete asshole. \n\nThe issue is the cat hates brushes and cannot effectively groom himself due to my sister NEVER brushing him when she had him. He gets matted a lot, and I usually have to shave him down in order to not get my arms used as a scratching post when I try to use a brush on him. She\u2019s now using the fact that he was matted when she visited that he should get a new \u201cforever home\u201d despite being the issue that he is the way he is. This is after asking me two weeks ago if I\u2019d be willing to take him to which I said of course. \n\nShe suddenly texted our group chat out of the blue claiming that she found a new \u201cforever home\u201d for him and when I said no, she kept arguing with me claiming he\u2019s her \u201cson\u201d and that I basically don\u2019t have a choice in the matter. I let her know I\u2019ve been taking care of this cat financially, emotionally, and physically by myself for almost a year and that isn\u2019t happening. She didn\u2019t respond to the text, so now I\u2019m worried that she\u2019s going to come to the house and just take him one day while i\u2019m at work. I told our brother that Id be calling the cops if that happened and he\u2019s been mad at\nme calling me dramatic, and I\u2019m beginning to feel that it was a bit much for me to threaten that. \n\nSo would I be the asshole if I did?\n\nTDLR; My sister wants to take back her cat and give him a forever home after she abandoned him, and I\u2019m threatening with calling the cops.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the advice! I\u2019m not 100% sure if my cat is microchipped so I\u2019m heading to the vet later to get it checked out. He\u2019s also still registered at the vet under my mom\u2019s name so she\u2019s going to sign him off to me while we\u2019re there.\nLooking into security cameras, and thank you again everyone!", "created_utc": 1667065857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygq38c/wibta_if_i_called_the_cops_on_my_sister_for/", "score": 457, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because if he thinks you're being dramatic for putting out there that you would be keeping an animal that your sister neglected, and then abandoned with you, he's being an asshole. Even if your sister did come with a lot of cash in her hand to compensate you for taking care of the cat, the issue here is that when the animal is in her custody she was neglectful.

She has no rights to a cat she abandoned. How she can even claim it to be her \"son\" is beyond me. You don\u2019t abandoned by up and leaving a child and you don't abandon pets in the same way. They are living creatures and deserve love and to be cared for. \n\n\nAt the same time, you know that the cat has issues with being brushed and that their fur gets matted. Matted fur is painful and causes a lot of issues. You have had a year to train and help the cat adapt and learn to accept a brushing. If it has failed you should get the cat groomed regularly before the fur is so matted that people are concerned. If you want the cat so badly, properly car for him or rehome him it.\n\nPS: How would she be able to take the cat while you are gone? Do you live with your parents and they would let her in or roommates?\n\nIf so, I would make sure that roommates know she's not allowed to have the cat. If she has a key to your place change the locks.", "YWBTA. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem with the question you asked. She has made no attempt to actually take the cat nor has she made any threat to take the cat. She only talked about him getting a different home. None of what your sister has done is illegal. So calling the cops would result in them doing nothing since no crime has been committed. You might even get in trouble for calling them for no reason. \n\nNow just to clarify, I am not saying that it would be okay for your sister to take the cat. But that is not what you asked about. I had a similar situation happen in that a car was abandoned and I claimed him. Luckily the former owner never tried to force anything with it. \n\nNow on to the real problem, the cat\u2019s fur. My guess is the cat doesn\u2019t like being brushed because your sister either never did it or only did it when his fur was already matted. Trying to brush out matter or tangled fur/hair is painful and a cat will perceive that as an attack. Hence his reaction. \n\nIf you want to resolve this problem you need to make brushing a fun thing. First off make sure you have the proper brush. Yes there are different brushes for different length fur. \n\nSecond, help him understand the brush is his friend. Get him shaved to get rid of all of his mats and tangles. Then get him a treat that he only gets when brushing. Something he\u2019ll really love. If you don\u2019t give him canned food already then this could be a great treat. If he does get canned food then find him something else like cooked chicken or some other juicy cooked meat. \n\nStart off brushing him the day after he gets shaved. Yeah he has no fur to brush but that also means he has no tangles that will hurt. Put the treat down so he can eat it while you brush him. Be calm yourself, talk gently to him while brushing and combine brushing with petting. One struck of the brush with one hand followed by one petting stroke with the other hand. \n\nThis should help him associate brushing with good things. Plus if you brush him daily that should prevent the tangles so brushing shouldn\u2019t hurt. \n\nHope things work out for you and the kitty!", "NTA for trying to protect your cat, but Y W B T A if you did it by involving the cops, who are in the business of ruining or even ending the lives of both those they're called on and random bystanders, rather than changing the locks of your house or getting him microchipped and registering him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We never shaved them but we did have to regularly cut out mats", "I have an older cat who has arthritis and he can't reach all the way back anymore, so he gets brushed", "I had a long haired cat that sat on slugs in the garden all the time.  The matts were next level!", "I have 3 long haired cats and one very rarely gets mattes one gets them occasionally and the 3rd gets covered in them. The one that gets mattes the worst hates the brush and matte comb and will claw the crap out of me. I still find ways to take care of him but he doesn\u2019t groom himself as well as the other 2  I\u2019ve had him since he was 4 weeks old and he\u2019s always had siblings or his surrogate mom (the cat that gets some mattes) to groom him so I think he\u2019s just lazy. It\u2019s also the texture of his fur.", "I had a long haired Tom cat who couldn't maintain his tail during shedding season, but only his tail. I would brush it out every few days until he stopped shedding. It just depends on the cat", "Long hair cats. My Maine Coon would get them so bad the groomer had to do lions cut a lot because he was a lazy shit and wouldn't groom himself properly and fought me every bath and brush time lol.", "She definitely doesn\u2019t have my parents permission. My mom and I are heading to the vet after she gets off of work to sign him under my name because he\u2019s still under my mom\u2019s technically.", "[deleted]", "I don\u2019t usually post him on anything besides showing my friends irl or my friends on discord. She\u2019s not in my server, and she hates our parents. I don\u2019t know what prompted it then", "Yeah, but she did give you 100$ to take care of the cat. So, technically she also has a ownership of the cat..\n\nAnd on top of that, it's just a cat..... Not some jewellery which costs thousands of dollars.", "Indeed, if she's going to keep going out and trying to make drama, you need to settle it", "[removed]", "Be quiet. Thanks.", "My last long haired girl also had a smooth tongue! I was really surprised at that.\n\nAnd I have to ask, is your Janeway a captain?", "If she takes the cat against your and your parents wishes (you are a rent-paying tenant) that's theft", "Pretty common for people who are going away on vacation or for long term work travel, and would hire housesitters to mind their place, but specifically because they have pets they get a pet sitter who mostly takes care of the pets and a little takes care of the house. I've known people doing that 20+ years ago so it's not even a new thing.", "Why is pet sitting any different than people paying for a boarding kennel? I\u2019m FAR from rich and *I* even hire a pet sitter. You either have no pets, never take vacation if you do, or if you *do* leave town without someone looking after your pets - you *suck*", "It\u2019s for when people go out of town - someone comes every day to feed and water the cat, give any medicine, clean the litter box, and provide some play/affection for a few minutes. It\u2019s not like a nanny for cats.", "Wow, I don't know what to say. I can't imagine why your brother isn't taking your side, but I was mistaken to say your family was toxic. It's just your sister. I feel for you, because I can only imagine you're on edge every minute of the day, thinking she'll come by and just take him. Please convince your parents to change the locks. I had a sister who hated our parents, had keys to the house and robbed them blind. There's more to my story but this isn't about me. I love animals so I'm totally on your side. Say....do you have a trusted friend, maybe the one you're moving in with, who can take the cat for the next few months? I would hate to see your brother open the door to your sister and she just helps herself to the cat.", "This is so strange. Maybe she could just sense that you were happy through the force", "It's very obvious that our source of contention here isn't my reading comprehension it's that I consider advocating calling the cops outside of life and death scenarios to be a deeply pro cop attitude and you consider it to be anti cop to suggest that advocating not calling them when no-one's in danger is idiocy", "Unfortunately no, he\u2019s living in another city 45 minutes away and he\u2019d have to pay a hefty fine to have the cat with him at his current apartment. My cats stay in my room for the most part so I\u2019m not as worried if she comes while I\u2019m here", "Oh perfect! Actually, get a lock on your door, one that requires a key to get in as soon as you can. Extreme? Maybe. But you have a few months only before you're out of there. Better for those cats to be safe. I'm sorry you're going through this. I don't get why she's so pushy on taking those cats from you. Good luck."]}
