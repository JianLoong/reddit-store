Especially since she's projecting her own life views on a separate person from herself. NTA", "NTA, it sounds like they are white knighting. Protecting you so that people can see what great people they are by protecting you. It doesn't really sound like they care about your feelings, or really care to protect your feelings, because they also are not willing to listen to you speak your mind. You are not their performance piece, you are not here so that they can sacrifice themselves on the cross of iniquity and Martyr themselves while letting everybody know they are doing so. You weren't rude, you didn't say anything horrible and nasty, the way that you engaged was completely appropriate. You do you, and it is totally fine to never want to have kids.", "NTA- if you were upset, she wouldn't be helping.\n\nShe's making your infertility about her. Their efforts aren't kind at all. You're the one who is dealing with infertility. It sounds like you're pretty chill about it.", "NTA at all and they need to back off. It\u2019s borderline inappropriate and insulting to assume. I (f19) also at pretty sure I don\u2019t want kids mostly because I don\u2019t like them, but another big part is struggling with mental health most of my life. Though I\u2019ve broken the cycle, I don\u2019t want to risk putting a child through what I went through. As a 19 y/o, the thought of having a child rn is insane and a lot of this may be projection. It would be completely understandable to be upset over being infertile, but it\u2019s not a crime to be indifferent. In a way, it\u2019s maybe slightly more convenient (still use condoms bestie. You don\u2019t need an STI or miracle baby). I\u2019d try one last time to just sit her down and flat out say that you\u2019re not bothered that she\u2019s pregnant while you\u2019re infertile, you yourself don\u2019t want kids and you\u2019re not jealous, and that it\u2019s uncomfortable that she continues to act like it\u2019s taboo. If she continues to disregard these facts, that\u2019s completely her and her problems. Nothing is wrong with this. A few others have mentioned to keep in mind that pregnancy causes your hormones to be insane, which is true and important to remember. But that\u2019s not an excuse to ignore your feelings.", "NTA they're mad you aren't a wreck about this that is bizarre. Just because you aren't' reacting to this how they would doesn't make you weird.  \n\nTell her be glad she can have kids as she obviously wants them but her choices and wants are not yours and while you appreciate her attempts to cater to your feelings they are unnecessary.", "NTA - She is annoyed that your news meant that her current state of fertility is no longer the \\*most important thing\\* and is trying desperately to make your situation all about her. She was hoping for drama and, finding none, decided to make her own. \n\nJust ignore her from now on when she tries to hide her belly. \n\nIf she yells at people \"on your behalf\" for asking about her pregnancy just act confused and say to the other person \"I'm so sorry, I have told her I am absolutely fine with my situation, but she finds it very upsetting. Please don't feel like you've done anything wrong!\"\n\nIf she tells you how sorry she is that you have to see this reminder say \"I have told you that I don't view this as a tragedy, but if you see it that way - why do you bringing it up?\"\n\nIf she says you should be thankful that she is not rubbing it in your face say \"You bring up my infertility more than anyone else I know, how is that not rubbing it in my face?\"\n\nAnd when the baby comes and they want you to babysit and help out say \"I'm just not comfortable doing that, I'm sure you understand\" and let her interpret that however she wants.", "NTA. How dare you not compliment them on how obviously thoughtful they are being. LoL. She's so bothered it doesn't bother you like she needs it to bother you. You've accepted this and moved on.", "NTA.  Just sit them down and have a polite conversation letting them know how happy you are for them and how you are looking forward to seeing your nephew/niece but that you genuinely are not sad about the news but that you are grateful for their kind consideration.", "NTA at all. Seems she\u2019s upset enough for you! It\u2019s the thought that counts tho thing, but she\u2019s also pregnant and very hormonal herself which might explain why she\u2019s overly emotional about something that doesn\u2019t concern her", "NTA. They need to realize that not everyone wants kids. If I were told that I'm infertile, I would react the same way you did because I've never wanted kids.\n\nShe probably doesn't understand that you don't want kids and aren't upset about your infertility, and it seems like she's taking your infertility harder than you are. She might've envisioned her kid(s) and yours being friends, or it could just be pregnancy hormones. Or maybe she thinks you should be taking it harder or that youre lying about how you feel. Give her some space and maybe sit down later and have a conversation about it.", "NTA- your sister is on a whole other planet. Your worth as a woman is not dictated by giving birth to a child. But- just let her do her own thing. Trying to get this through her head is not going to work right now.\n\nI would talk to your mom if you can and tell her you understand that your sister is on the pregnancy hormone ride- but that you are really over her drama, and the last thing you would ever want for yourself is to have a baby at 19 anyway- and can she please run interference on this the next time because your patience is wearing thin. \n\nYour mom\u2019s sadness makes sense- btw- no loving parent likes seeing their child\u2019s options cut down due to medical issues.", "NTA. You handled it well. They sound like they are\u2026a lot. Self-serving and pretentious as hell.", "NTA\n\nShe had given herself the starring role in your infertility story and is annoyed you\u2019ve rewritten the script.", "Why are SO many people convinced that breeding other humans is everyone's eventual goal? As a CF person myself, HUGE nta! There is nothing wrong with not wanting kids, period. That said, your sis has some hormones to work through so I would let this go. You informed her that she is allowed to talk about her baby without upsetting you...let her sit on that for a while.", "NTA, your feelings do not need justification from or by others.", "NTA. Your step-sister and her boyfriend aren't behaving this way for you, they're behaving this way for them so they can pat themselves on the back and tell themselves what kind, considerate people they are.\n\nYou know what kind, considerate people do? Listen when others tell them things.", "> She got offended and told me being a mother is one of the best things you could experience and I was being \u201cweird\u201d and should be thankful she\u2019s not rubbing it in my face.\n\nShe *is* intentionally rubbing it in your face, and she's mad at you for not being upset. NTA.", "She's a person that cannot conceive that a person doesn't want a child and you don't. NTA", "NTA.

That's ridiculous.", "NTA", "NTA, just say \"I'm sorry for being too happy / sad about being infertile, whichever makes you stop talking about this\"", "Nobody remind this lady that roughly half of the population is unable to get pregnant. She would not be able to sleep at night!", "Nta you are not required to want kids. I actually know a person who cried with joy when they found out they couldn't have kids. \n\nOn the flip side though remember your step sister is pregnant and that really messes with your hormones. It's why a pregnant person can be having the time of their lives and then end up crying like a baby.", "NTA. They should be backing you up in feeling that it is perfectly possible to have a good and happy life without kids, because it really is!", "NTA, they aren't be kind. They are acting out some kind of weird savior-complex behavior and need to knock it off.\n\nYou sound firmly childfree, not childless. If you can get your mom to intervene on your behalf.", "NAH. The two of you are entirely different people and she just can't comprehend how someone wouldn't want children as she seems to want nothing more. Both are valid and, apart from a lack of empathy, I can understand how she would assume the reminder would be hurtful to someone who actually did care.\n\nThe two of you should sit down and have a calm heart to heart. Try to explain the reasons you told us why being infertile is fine for you. Maybe she'll understand, maybe she won't. If she can't, take deep breaths and try and stay calm in those situations. She seems to mean it from a good place. It will calm down the more time passes.", "NAH.\n\nI see both sides. \n\nI mean, she\u2019s pregnant. Of course your news is going to hit her hard. She\u2019s hormonal and all she can think about is the excitement from being pregnant and the sadness that you won\u2019t get to experience it (even if you don\u2019t want it)\n\nIt\u2019s big news to hear you\u2019re infertile and I\u2019m glad you view it as a blessing. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re trying to be there for her if you both are having trouble seeing each others views.

It didn't sound like either of you meant any harm to each other.  Your sister sounds like she wanted to protect you a bit.  You didn't need it.  A \"I truly appreciate you guys looking out for me, but I assure you, I'm okay and at peace with everything\" should be or should've been enough to put this issue to rest.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
