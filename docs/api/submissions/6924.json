It was THE WORST and I hated every minute of it.", "Not sure if it\u2019s religious but most the women in her family got pregnant real young and not by accident. Her and her boyfriend not were saying they wanted to have a baby back and they were 17 so it makes sense for her. I don\u2019t know anything about her religion though", "Maybe stepsister is already getting offended by the idea that OP won't love her baby enough or whatever because OP doesn't want kids herself.", "Yeah, even if they aren't religious (bet they're evangelists) they are definitely fertility worshipers. Ick.", "I really hope that\u2019s not it. Ever since we found out about her pregnancy (before I found out I\u2019m infertile) I kept saying how I couldn\u2019t wait to be the \u201csuper cool aunt\u201d but from the day we met I never hid that kids just wouldn\u2019t be a very good idea for me. I love them though an everyone tells me I\u2019m a great babysitter"]}
