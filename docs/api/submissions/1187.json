She would like to be my friend, but this is a no go for me, as she is younger than me and played a significant part in destroying our family. However, she is not the only villian here.

He's nearly *three times* her age. \n\nThere is zero reason for you to be friends with her.\n\nYou might, to be petty, offer to babysit her now and then.", "NTA. She's not his new wife bound to be in your life and from what you say you're civil to her, which is more than I'd be.", "NTA and it's absurd of your dad and his gf to expect you to be friendly with either of them. Your dad should feel lucky you even still want to talk to him, much less be friends with his side piece.", "Nta-as long as you\u2019re civil, there is no requirement to be \u201cfriends\u201d or spend any extra time with GF. This also means to not being a wedge between them, and it doesn\u2019t sound like you are doing doing that", "NTA.  I would imagine a 20 year old who hooks up with a 58 year old doesn't have much for friends in her life and she is seeing you as someone close to her age to try and build her social life.", "Nta-", "NTA -  Ask dad to meet you alone.  Tell him\n\n\"You will always be my dad and while I love you - you have to accept that what you've done to our family is a big deal that I am still working thru.  You didn't pick my friends when I was a kid, please don't start now.  Instead of worrying about my relationship with her - maybe we should concentrate on OUR relationship.  Who knows, if your relationship with her stands the test of time -- maybe things will change down the line - but right now, no promises.\"", "NTA", ">\"she really wants to be my friend\"\n\nThen maybe don't be an affair partner and more people might like you?

You don't owe anyone an explanation if you don't feel like giving one. If he pursues a long term relationship with this young woman you may need to deal with that if you want a relationship with your dad, but that's something for you to consider your own feelings on down the road when you're ready to deal with that.", "YUK.  I dunno, might not be nice, but I'd wanna ask her WTF she sees in your dad a man technically old enough to be her grandpa.  NTA.", "NTA. Tell him she is too young to be your friend.", "NTA.  I think your father is creepy.  Next time one of them tells you to spend time with his GF just say you don't want to be friends with one of the two people who broke up your family and hurt your mom.
