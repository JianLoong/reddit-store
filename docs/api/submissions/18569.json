For background, my family isn\u2019t extremely religious or anything, but are more on the traditional side in terms of certain behaviors where it\u2019s like \u201cif you want to do it, just do it behind closed doors\u201d. For example, smoking or excessive drinking will definitely not pass in front of certain members. They don\u2019t care if you do it in your personal life, but don\u2019t indulge when the family is gathered together. Chris\u2019s similar so it hasn\u2019t been a problem when he\u2019s with my family and they respect that. On the other hand, his family is very different - there\u2019s always alcohol/vapes, stuff like that around. I don\u2019t mind when I\u2019m with them, it\u2019s not a big deal for me personally.\n\nBut the issue arose because my parents have a beach house and hosted a gathering this past weekend and invited Chris\u2019 family to come stop by to get to know them better. Chris and I sat his family down in advance to let them know that we would appreciate it if they didn\u2019t get drunk and smoke and to be courteous of cultural differences between the families when it comes to stuff like this.\n\nThey came down and all was well with his parents, but his sister Lizzie (22F) just was an absolute mess. As soon as she got there, she got extremely drunk and kept trying to offer my underage cousins drinks, kept using her vape around literal children, took off her bathing suit top at the pool for \u201ctanning purposes\u201d in front of my entire family. My mom then kindly asked her to cover up, but Lizzie kind of just looked at her and didn\u2019t do anything. It just got to the point that my parents kept saying they were uncomfortable in their own home, so I pulled her aside to help her sober up and reminded her about what Chris and I asked in terms of behavior while here. Immediately she started saying that Chris and I are misogynistic for trying to tell \u201ca grown woman\u201d how to wear her bikini, said you should never ask a woman to cover up for other people\u2019s comfort, and that she\u2019s a guest and my parents need to get over their \u201carchaic\u201d values.\n\nAt this point I just sternly asked her to leave and she refused but Chris forced it too and drove her home. But now some of their relatives are texting both of us saying my family is extremely rude and that Chris shouldn\u2019t even think about marrying into such a \u201cconservative\u201d family because we don\u2019t like certain kinds of behavior. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong because my parents deserve to kick out people that disrespect their wishes and kindness from their home. Also I found it extremely disappointing that Lizzie knew beforehand what it would be like, still came, and chose to behave in the exact manner I had asked her not to. But regardless of how I explain my side, Chris\u2019 family basically hates me and thinks my family is full of up tight AHs and now I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve ruined the relationship with his side if we choose to get married down the road.

Public disturbance is not misogynistic in the slightest.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It doesn't even matter that your family is conservative; it matters that the sister made no effort to be a good guest. Part of being a good guest is to read the room and behave in a way that matches the energy of other guests.", "NTA. When you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home, it is polite to follow their traditions and be respectful of their culture- everything from removing your shoes if they ask, to eating the food they serve, to you know\u2026 not stripping and trying to get their infer age family members drunk. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a guest you\u2019re supposed to be on your best behavior- someone is opening their home to you! The least you can do is respect them. If she was at her own home, then do whatever you want. But not in someone\u2019s else\u2019s.", "NTA, what admiration are you trying to get from these people? I think the real issue is that Chris's family don't understand context and basic etiquette. They were guests and Lizzie used the opportunity to drink heavily, vape and sunbathe nude. Any reasonable person would just sit around, chit chat and eat instead of getting blasted and getting in a fight with the hosts. Even my most degenerate friends know how to not make a scene when necessary. If you can't expect them to put in that tiniest bit of effort why are you trying to make them like you?", "NTA- she\u2019s right she was a guest and as a guest she should respect the owners of the house. The entitlement is unreal. Also I am a part of a very un-conservative family and even we would find nudity and vaping near small children problematic.", "NTA.  Are you sure you really want to marry into his family? Cause your family is going to be stuck with this as long as you are married....and so are you.", "NTA- can't see why someone wouldn't check their behaviors based on where they are. Would she act like this at a public pool? (Probably). Someone who goes to someone's house, vapes, drinks to excess, and gets nude... yeah that's not conservative vs liberal. It's A H vs normal. I may do that at my house but not someone elses   \n\nGiving drinks to minors, smoking around kids, getting drunk, and your tits out too! At least she brought the party /s", "NTA. Whatever subtext there may or may not be with decorum vs. freedom, you laid out the ground rules well ahead of time, and she didn\u2019t follow them. This one\u2019s on her.", "NTA- she was a GUEST, this isnt her home. She was asked to put her top back ON, not to wear neck to knee swimwear! \n\nShe was kicked out due to her own bad behavior and can see why she acts that way since the parents are backing her up. Expect this to be a theme for as long as you're around that family.", "NTA\n\nLiberal or conservative, I'd have to guess that most families in the U.S. frown upon houseguests' topless sunbathing and pushing alcohol on minors (especially after being asked to stop).", "Just for clarification, are you in the US? The reason that I ask is because taking your top off to sunbathe in front of people here might be very different than in other countries. \n\nNTA, for reasons more than just taking and keeping her bathing suit top off. Lizzie was completely inappropriate to offer under age family members alcohol. Even if she did none of these things, if she's that drunk and disruptive your family has the right to ask her to leave. It's your parents' house.", "NTA - you were asking for some basic decorum and she couldnt even do that.", "NTA-Both you and your boyfriend had said not to do that.If his family thinks you and your family are aholes for asking someone not to do that kind of stuff and they can't respect that they are the ahole for not respecting those around them.Plus as you said she was trying to give people underage alcohol anywhere else that would have put her in jail.All the things she did makes her the Ahole for not having any respect for anyone other then the people who agree with her that your family horrible people.", "NTA she was told in advance what would be considered unacceptable behavior, and she could have stayed home if it was that big of a hardship to keep her top on and not get shitty drunk.", "NTA - Those are pretty basic and reasonable expectations to begin with. And especially if you warned them in advance to not do this, it seems ridiculous they would be surprised by what happened.", "NTA.  Your guests knew the ground rules, regardless of how archaic they deemed those rules to be.   If they had no intention of respecting them  --  including offering vapes to children  -- they should have declined or stayed elsewhere. \n\nAs regards your boyfriend's marriage: that is between him and you.  It's no one else's business.", "NTA. She should show proper respect for the people who have opened up their home to her as a guest. She's being a self centered brat and the family that supports her ahs is trashing her are equal as bad. How your bf handles his family in regards to this will determine if he's marriage material for you or not.", "NTA at all, she was intentionally baiting your family and it's insane to say that nobody has the right to ask a guest to not be topless in their home.\n\nI married into a family of partiers and I love them dearly. They are *very* different from my family. None of them would ever think it was ok to offer booze or vapes to kids (even older teens) and none of them would think it remotely ok for a chick to have her tits out at a family event.  When my family goes to their events, they know what to expect and respect it. When my in-laws come to my families events, they know what to expect and respect it. We have never had issues even though we are very different. My in-laws don't get plastered at my family's events, and my family doesn't give them the side eye for smoking weed at in-law events. It's just not that difficult to be polite.", "NTA. People can set whatever rules for guests in their home. \n\nThat your inlaws might be mad, and think your family are a bunch of uptight jerks, is their business. \n\nDoes that create more difficulty in building your marriage? Yes. That\u2019s for you to navigate", "NTA.\n\nHow very hypocritical that Chris' family want yours to respect their way of life, but aren't willing to respect your family's ways.", "NTA.  Lizzie is exactly the kind of nightmare relatives no one wants.  Not even her own family. Their complaints are BS and they know it.  \n\nWhat a shame this happened. I suppose there won't be any more future invites by your family to his.", "Nta necessarily, you shouldnt try and control people, but she was excessive in her behavior", "NTA. My family is a bit of a rowdy crowd, but we all know that not every family is like us, so we keep ourselves in check when needed\u2014such as a situation like this. Assimilating in someone else\u2019s house is just respectful, it has nothing to do with anyone else being controlling or uptight.", "NTA. I was originally going with yes, but the sister refusing to put her top back on(with children around) is a problem", "NTA- getting shit faced and letting the  tatas loose infront of a bunch of people you are just meeting is a NO NO even if your hosts are not the conservative type .\n\nGeeez Louise !\n\nI\u2019m glad you boyfriend has your back, his family sounds disrespectful and like they might have an inferiority complex.", "NTA.\n\nYour house, your rules. They were incredibly disrespectful of your family's rules/requests. Your family obviously didn't serve any alcohol, so they obviously *brought their own booze* after being told no drinking! Who does that?!? \n\nChris's family sounds like they were raised in a barn!", "Boyfriend's sister's family sounds trashy as fuck. NTA", "My family is the opposite of conservative but if people smoked/vaped at my house where I asked them not to and got half naked in front of my kids/family I would bounce them so fast.  NTA", "So here is the problem with giving you a clear NTA verdict (which I am doing anyway). Lizzie created a host of problems not related to how she was dressed, so it is weird that it was the focus of you and your mother. \n\nLizzie offered underage kids alcohol, which is illegal and obviously creates immediate issues (drunk teens) and longer term issues when they want to drink other times - she should have been asked to leave then. \n\nShe was vaping around kids- she could have been asked to leave here too.\n\nShe took her top off at a family event- sure, in certain cultures (hello France) being topless at the beach is perfectly fine, but in a lot of whole countries, being topless in a pool at a large gathering is bad behavior. I'm American, I enjoy the nude sections (legal or not) of beaches here, and I'm a liberal socialist, and I'd still side eye hard the woman at a family gathering taking her top off, because that's not acceptable behavior in the US in general. \n\nSo I tell you to refocus the narrative here and communicate (have Chris do it with his family) that his sister was asked to leave because she tried repeatedly to give underage kids alcohol and vaped in front of children when asked not to. Sure, she was also asked to put her top back on, but she was actually asked to leave for trying to break the law and being so drunk she made lots of people uncomfortable. Again, as a super liberal person, if I was told THAT version, I'd be like \"oh wow, Lizzie is a mess\" instead of \"what crazy conservatives are these people.\"", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are NTA. You tried to help the families blend before they even got together and the one bad egg in the basket just didn\u2019t care. You handled it well. You may want to elope though. Lol.", "NTA. What did Lizzies parents do when she was doing all of this? Just remember she has to come to the wedding\u2026 tits and all. She\u2019s gonna have them wagging all over the place.", "NTA. You and your family are not prudish for not wanting someone to get drunk at a family gathering, vape in front of children, or sunbathe topless. There are times and places for those things - a meet-the-family gathering where you\u2019ve been *specifically* requested not to do those things is definitely neither the time nor the place. Your BF\u2019s sister was incredibly disrespectful to your parents, then threw a tantrum when politely requested to follow the rules of the house. She didn\u2019t have to be there if being sober and polite are so terribly difficult for her.", "She left her brain home to rest it seems ,thats the only logical reason for this behavior.", "NTA at all. This wasn't about what she was wearing, it was about her uncurteous behaviour. It seems like she was determined from the get-go to offend so she could then blame you for being stuck up. And where were the parents during all this? If my daughter pulled that stunt in my presence, I would do anything to apologise to the family. You *deserve* an apology, no matter what messages you're getting.", "NTA.  She was ridiculous and being deliberate.  Here in Ontario, it is legal for a woman to go to topless anywhere.   I have yet in my 50 plus years to spot anyone.", "NTA\n\n> Immediately she started saying that Chris and I are misogynistic for trying to tell \u201ca grown woman\u201d how to wear her bikini, said you should never ask a woman to cover up for other people\u2019s comfort, and that she\u2019s a guest and my parents need to get over their \u201carchaic\u201d values.\n\nYeah, she\u2019s rude. Expecting people to not smoke or get drunk at a family gathering and for women to keep their tops on (and everyone to keep their bottoms on) *is completely reasonable*. \n\nShe came to your house with the intention to disrespect your family\u2019s rules. \n\nAnd for the record nothing in the expectations you listed sound particularly conservative. \n\nIt\u2019s important to not be a doormat when people are behaving badly.", "NTA- at least now you know how shitty was his family, cut tie with them. Had no contact today, tomorrow or anytime.", "NTA.\n\nDamn, first let me just say that I'm not conservative AT ALL. I'm sooo far from it, and I definitely enjoy a good party where the guests are generally \"Lizzie-ing it up\".\n\nBut for fucks sake, I would NEVER behave like that while visiting the home of someone I'm meeting for the first time (unless specifically invited to debauch by the host or if that's the explicit reason for the party). Doesn't matter if they're conservative or not. That's just... who the fuck behaves like that in a house full of strangers? That's so entitled. \n\nEven just the vaping alone is disrespectful as hell. I could be about to do a line off someone's ass before the 20 person orgy and I would STILL ask if it's okay to vape inside before doing so (hyperbolic example but yeah).\n\nAnd the fact that Lizzie was the only one behaving like this? That's so fucking embarrassing for her. It would be sad and embarrassing to see in person, I'm sure.", "Sweetie...do you really want to marry into that family?  Because yuck.  NTA but you would absolutely be an AH to yourself if you want his family's approval because they're trashy.", "Lol how can you marry someone who has such a problematic family is the correct question. Oh dear I'm afraid more challenges await you in future.", "NTA\n\nMy family is the opposite of conservative...but that lack of respect wouldn't fly at all\n\nYou did the right thing in the situation she put you in", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend's sister has shown you how she'll act around boundaries.\n\nNone of your requests were misogynist just the basic \"Hey don't overly drink or smoke.\" Telling her to put her bikini top back on is just common sense as it's not her house or a private/public pool that allows it.  \n\nYour boyfriend though is sweet and did the right thing by sticking to your side.  I hope you two have a flourishing and happy relationship.", "I\u2019d say NTA. She was being inappropriate, especially if she was offering drinks/vapes/etc. to underage guests.", "NTA, if y\u2019all get married, please don\u2019t invite sister or anyone saying you were in the wrong.", "She\u2019s in the wrong because she was a guest in someone\u2019s house and you just don\u2019t do stuff like that. That being said,I don\u2019t have to follow your traditions (to an extent) just because I\u2019m in your house. \n\nFor example if you pray before dinner, I\u2019m an atheist,just because I\u2019m in your house doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to do that and you can\u2019t force me to do it. Let\u2019s say something misogynistic gets said ,just because I\u2019m in your house doesn\u2019t mean I have to laugh about it and agree to it. But basic respect of someone else\u2019s house is a given and your SIL didn\u2019t do that.", "NTA.\nHis family has no respect for anyone and their boundaries.\nAnd trying to pull the misogynistic card is just pathetic.\nLizzie needs to grow up and show respect to others if she wants other to show respect to her.", "NTA she took her bathing suit top off at a BBQ.  I am pretty flexible and easygoing when I entertain, but that would have been a deal breaker for me.  This is about basic respect for other humans.  The response from you BF's family is baffling.  They must really let it all hang out....literally.", "Right? Sounds like Lizzie is on the hot mess express.", "You people and your hair triggers... It's ONE family member that's an AH, and the rest of the family most likely got a skewed story from Chris's sister, causing their reaction. Not exactly grounds to make or break a life-long relationship. Have you never been in love before? Do you not understand the lengths people go to be with their soulmate? This is nothing. Also, the sister is fresh out of college, basically still a child mentally. She may grow wiser with age.", "*cough* moot\n\nHer point is moot\n\nIn situations like these I always wonder what information gets left out in the retelling.\n\nLike, did she tell her family the FULL story, or did she just tell them that she was unfairly targeted for wearing a bikini wrong", "I don't know, just \"got really drunk and took her top off\" makes her sound like a mess to me.", "Oh hey, are you the person who decided it was appropriate to go topless at someone else\u2019s home, smoke, get drunk, and try to encourage under age drinking?\n\nAnd she wasn\u2019t just kicked out for doing those things - but refusing to stop and insulting OP and OP\u2019s family.", " In her parents\u2019 private home at a party her parents were hosting, and the expectations were made clear ahead of time?\n\nIt absolutely was her business.\n\nThat person was invited as family of the person she was dating; which also makes it her business.", "Offering underage children drinks whilst smoking around them? That\u2019s a weird ass definition of misogyny. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t like kids either, but I draw the line at getting them drunk whilst blowing smoke in their faces. I would think that should be other people\u2019s business, we should all be ensuring that kinda shit doesn\u2019t happen. \nGetting your tits out? Eh. On a public beach I guess go for it if you want. I actually don\u2019t care if kids see tits. However on private property when you\u2019ve been told not to? I\u2019d see that as any other establishment that has that rule. Which is basically all of them. Gallery? Museum? Bar? Keep your tits in. Flap \u2018em around somewhere else. I get liking your tits. I\u2019m fond of mine. But they stay caged where appropriate", ">I was surprised to hear that others thought differently\n\nYes, but consider the source.\n\nIt would be worth talking with Chris in a little bit to help him process the whole thing. He may be dealing with a lot of emotions, especially because his family of origin could not be bothered to show up for him in a way that he needed them to, and when he called them on it, they made it clear where he stands relative to the free-boobin' drunky. \n\nThat's going to hurt, and he's going to be processing a lot around where his own loyalties are.", "If you and Chris truly love each other, I really hope you won't overlook a future with him just because you don't get along with his family. Honestly I think tension with in-laws is extremely common, and the real focus should be on the relationship with your partner. My family is pretty hard to get along with/earn the respect of, so I would be shit out of luck if there wasn't anyone willing to deal with them.", "That's a conversation you should be having with your boyfriend.  These differences might be large enough for the both of you to decide to end the relationship.  But for him, being estranged from his family (who, for all we know, may also disrespect his boundaries as badly as they do yours and your families') might not be as important to him as having you in his life.  I don't know either way, but if you see a potential future with this man, you need discuss this with him.", "I don\u2019t think this is normal behaviour in a typical American household - sounds to me like your parents are perfectly reasonable in what they expect of their guests. I mean, I\u2019ve never been to a family party where stripping, offering alcohol to teenagers, or gaping in front of little kids would be considered REMOTELY acceptable. Even getting out of control drunk in a setting like that is pretty frowned upon by most families, I would think, given the kids who were present.", "OP probably talks about religion at her bf's family's house.", "Unless you're in France, but as a British person I obviously have to put down the French. We just don't like them", "Your family dosen't sound crazy conservative...they just sound like reasonable people who don't want underage kids being thrown into a freaking 'frat house movie' party setting. The vaping and trying to get kids drunk is substantially worse to me. NTA The 22year old sounds like an absolute mess.", ">I would elope to avoid a bunch of trashy drunks ruining you wedding if I were you .\n\nOh, and these are *precisely* the people who will use the OP being \"snobby\" and \"uptight\" as an excuse to try and vex or humiliate the bride as often as possible.  Head them off at the pass.", "Only reason I'd care is I wouldn't want to see a family members tits. If it was all the same minus the topless part I'd not care (depending on the ages of the \"underage\" cousins or whatever for the drinks) but I'm pretty abnormal in the sense of behaviors that get under my skin. I'd rather someone pull this shit then hear my uncle go on a political rant tbh.", "I'm French, I like freeing my boobies at the beach, and I would do it in front of my mom or siblings, no problems.\n\nI would still not do it in front of my bf's parents. Or the parents of his sibling's partners, as is the case in this story."]}
