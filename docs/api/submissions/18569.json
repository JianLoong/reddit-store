{"id": 18569, "submission_id": "13vx3bi", "title": "AITA for asking my boyfriend\u2019s sister to leave our vacation because of how she dressed/acted?", "selftext": "I (25F) am dating Chris (28M) and we\u2019ve been together for two years now and he\u2019s close with my family. For background, my family isn\u2019t extremely religious or anything, but are more on the traditional side in terms of certain behaviors where it\u2019s like \u201cif you want to do it, just do it behind closed doors\u201d. For example, smoking or excessive drinking will definitely not pass in front of certain members. They don\u2019t care if you do it in your personal life, but don\u2019t indulge when the family is gathered together. Chris\u2019s similar so it hasn\u2019t been a problem when he\u2019s with my family and they respect that. On the other hand, his family is very different - there\u2019s always alcohol/vapes, stuff like that around. I don\u2019t mind when I\u2019m with them, it\u2019s not a big deal for me personally.\n\nBut the issue arose because my parents have a beach house and hosted a gathering this past weekend and invited Chris\u2019 family to come stop by to get to know them better. Chris and I sat his family down in advance to let them know that we would appreciate it if they didn\u2019t get drunk and smoke and to be courteous of cultural differences between the families when it comes to stuff like this.\n\nThey came down and all was well with his parents, but his sister Lizzie (22F) just was an absolute mess. As soon as she got there, she got extremely drunk and kept trying to offer my underage cousins drinks, kept using her vape around literal children, took off her bathing suit top at the pool for \u201ctanning purposes\u201d in front of my entire family. My mom then kindly asked her to cover up, but Lizzie kind of just looked at her and didn\u2019t do anything. It just got to the point that my parents kept saying they were uncomfortable in their own home, so I pulled her aside to help her sober up and reminded her about what Chris and I asked in terms of behavior while here. Immediately she started saying that Chris and I are misogynistic for trying to tell \u201ca grown woman\u201d how to wear her bikini, said you should never ask a woman to cover up for other people\u2019s comfort, and that she\u2019s a guest and my parents need to get over their \u201carchaic\u201d values.\n\nAt this point I just sternly asked her to leave and she refused but Chris forced it too and drove her home. But now some of their relatives are texting both of us saying my family is extremely rude and that Chris shouldn\u2019t even think about marrying into such a \u201cconservative\u201d family because we don\u2019t like certain kinds of behavior. I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong because my parents deserve to kick out people that disrespect their wishes and kindness from their home. Also I found it extremely disappointing that Lizzie knew beforehand what it would be like, still came, and chose to behave in the exact manner I had asked her not to. But regardless of how I explain my side, Chris\u2019 family basically hates me and thinks my family is full of up tight AHs and now I\u2019m worried I\u2019ve ruined the relationship with his side if we choose to get married down the road.

Public disturbance is not misogynistic in the slightest.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It doesn't even matter that your family is conservative; it matters that the sister made no effort to be a good guest. Part of being a good guest is to read the room and behave in a way that matches the energy of other guests.", "NTA. When you\u2019re a guest in someone\u2019s home, it is polite to follow their traditions and be respectful of their culture- everything from removing your shoes if they ask, to eating the food they serve, to you know\u2026 not stripping and trying to get their infer age family members drunk. \n\nWhen you\u2019re a guest you\u2019re supposed to be on your best behavior- someone is opening their home to you! The least you can do is respect them. If she was at her own home, then do whatever you want. But not in someone\u2019s else\u2019s.", "NTA, what admiration are you trying to get from these people? I think the real issue is that Chris's family don't understand context and basic etiquette. They were guests and Lizzie used the opportunity to drink heavily, vape and sunbathe nude. Any reasonable person would just sit around, chit chat and eat instead of getting blasted and getting in a fight with the hosts. Even my most degenerate friends know how to not make a scene when necessary. If you can't expect them to put in that tiniest bit of effort why are you trying to make them like you?", "NTA- she\u2019s right she was a guest and as a guest she should respect the owners of the house. The entitlement is unreal. Also I am a part of a very un-conservative family and even we would find nudity and vaping near small children problematic.", "NTA.  Are you sure you really want to marry into his family? Cause your family is going to be stuck with this as long as you are married....and so are you.", "NTA- can't see why someone wouldn't check their behaviors based on where they are. Would she act like this at a public pool? (Probably). Someone who goes to someone's house, vapes, drinks to excess, and gets nude... yeah that's not conservative vs liberal. It's A H vs normal. I may do that at my house but not someone elses   \n\nGiving drinks to minors, smoking around kids, getting drunk, and your tits out too! At least she brought the party /s", "NTA. Whatever subtext there may or may not be with decorum vs. freedom, you laid out the ground rules well ahead of time, and she didn\u2019t follow them. This one\u2019s on her.", "NTA- she was a GUEST, this isnt her home. She was asked to put her top back ON, not to wear neck to knee swimwear! \n\nShe was kicked out due to her own bad behavior and can see why she acts that way since the parents are backing her up. Expect this to be a theme for as long as you're around that family.", "NTA\n\nLiberal or conservative, I'd have to guess that most families in the U.S. frown upon houseguests' topless sunbathing and pushing alcohol on minors (especially after being asked to stop).", "Just for clarification, are you in the US? The reason that I ask is because taking your top off to sunbathe in front of people here might be very different than in other countries. \n\nNTA, for reasons more than just taking and keeping her bathing suit top off. Lizzie was completely inappropriate to offer under age family members alcohol. Even if she did none of these things, if she's that drunk and disruptive your family has the right to ask her to leave. It's your parents' house.", "NTA - you were asking for some basic decorum and she couldnt even do that.", "NTA-Both you and your boyfriend had said not to do that.If his family thinks you and your family are aholes for asking someone not to do that kind of stuff and they can't respect that they are the ahole for not respecting those around them.Plus as you said she was trying to give people underage alcohol anywhere else that would have put her in jail.All the things she did makes her the Ahole for not having any respect for anyone other then the people who agree with her that your family horrible people.", "NTA she was told in advance what would be considered unacceptable behavior, and she could have stayed home if it was that big of a hardship to keep her top on and not get shitty drunk.", "NTA - Those are pretty basic and reasonable expectations to begin with. And especially if you warned them in advance to not do this, it seems ridiculous they would be surprised by what happened.", "NTA.  Your guests knew the ground rules, regardless of how archaic they deemed those rules to be.   If they had no intention of respecting them  --  including offering vapes to children  -- they should have declined or stayed elsewhere. \n\nAs regards your boyfriend's marriage: that is between him and you.  It's no one else's business.", "NTA. She should show proper respect for the people who have opened up their home to her as a guest. She's being a self centered brat and the family that supports her ahs is trashing her are equal as bad. How your bf handles his family in regards to this will determine if he's marriage material for you or not.", "NTA at all, she was intentionally baiting your family and it's insane to say that nobody has the right to ask a guest to not be topless in their home.\n\nI married into a family of partiers and I love them dearly. They are *very* different from my family. None of them would ever think it was ok to offer booze or vapes to kids (even older teens) and none of them would think it remotely ok for a chick to have her tits out at a family event.  When my family goes to their events, they know what to expect and respect it. When my in-laws come to my families events, they know what to expect and respect it. We have never had issues even though we are very different. My in-laws don't get plastered at my family's events, and my family doesn't give them the side eye for smoking weed at in-law events. It's just not that difficult to be polite.", "NTA. People can set whatever rules for guests in their home. \n\nThat your inlaws might be mad, and think your family are a bunch of uptight jerks, is their business. \n\nDoes that create more difficulty in building your marriage? Yes. That\u2019s for you to navigate", "NTA.\n\nHow very hypocritical that Chris' family want yours to respect their way of life, but aren't willing to respect your family's ways.", "NTA.  Lizzie is exactly the kind of nightmare relatives no one wants.  Not even her own family. Their complaints are BS and they know it.  \n\nWhat a shame this happened. I suppose there won't be any more future invites by your family to his.", "Nta necessarily, you shouldnt try and control people, but she was excessive in her behavior", "NTA. My family is a bit of a rowdy crowd, but we all know that not every family is like us, so we keep ourselves in check when needed\u2014such as a situation like this. Assimilating in someone else\u2019s house is just respectful, it has nothing to do with anyone else being controlling or uptight.", "NTA. I was originally going with yes, but the sister refusing to put her top back on(with children around) is a problem", "NTA- getting shit faced and letting the  tatas loose infront of a bunch of people you are just meeting is a NO NO even if your hosts are not the conservative type .\n\nGeeez Louise !\n\nI\u2019m glad you boyfriend has your back, his family sounds disrespectful and like they might have an inferiority complex.", "NTA.\n\nYour house, your rules. They were incredibly disrespectful of your family's rules/requests. Your family obviously didn't serve any alcohol, so they obviously *brought their own booze* after being told no drinking! Who does that?!? \n\nChris's family sounds like they were raised in a barn!", "Boyfriend's sister's family sounds trashy as fuck. NTA", "My family is the opposite of conservative but if people smoked/vaped at my house where I asked them not to and got half naked in front of my kids/family I would bounce them so fast.  NTA", "So here is the problem with giving you a clear NTA verdict (which I am doing anyway). Lizzie created a host of problems not related to how she was dressed, so it is weird that it was the focus of you and your mother. \n\nLizzie offered underage kids alcohol, which is illegal and obviously creates immediate issues (drunk teens) and longer term issues when they want to drink other times - she should have been asked to leave then. \n\nShe was vaping around kids- she could have been asked to leave here too.\n\nShe took her top off at a family event- sure, in certain cultures (hello France) being topless at the beach is perfectly fine, but in a lot of whole countries, being topless in a pool at a large gathering is bad behavior. I'm American, I enjoy the nude sections (legal or not) of beaches here, and I'm a liberal socialist, and I'd still side eye hard the woman at a family gathering taking her top off, because that's not acceptable behavior in the US in general. \n\nSo I tell you to refocus the narrative here and communicate (have Chris do it with his family) that his sister was asked to leave because she tried repeatedly to give underage kids alcohol and vaped in front of children when asked not to. Sure, she was also asked to put her top back on, but she was actually asked to leave for trying to break the law and being so drunk she made lots of people uncomfortable. Again, as a super liberal person, if I was told THAT version, I'd be like \"oh wow, Lizzie is a mess\" instead of \"what crazy conservatives are these people.\"", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
