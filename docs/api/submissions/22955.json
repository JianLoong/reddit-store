{"id": 22955, "submission_id": "157e8x5", "title": "AITA for telling my mum it\u2019s her fault the family is upset?", "selftext": "I (24f) am expecting my first baby with my partner (28m). Currently 16 weeks along and we kept it quiet until 4 weeks ago until we had the scan and testing to make sure everything was okay etc.\n\nI told my mum first since it will be her first grandchild and the first great grandchild in my family. Naturally she was excited and told everyone within days which upset me slightly since I asked her to keep it quiet and that I wanted to tell people myself.\nMy aunts and my mum have always had a strained relationship. She has three sisters and my whole life she has been arguing with or has fallen out with all of them for extended periods of time over stupid things (they always make up in the end because apparently that\u2019s what sisters do) but this means myself and my cousins never spent much time together and we are all basically strangers to one another.\n\nThis brings me to last week , my mum calls and asks when and where I would like a baby shower and I told her I didn\u2019t. She said that was crazy and that my aunts were excited and even said they would all like a scan picture from my next appointment and wanted to know how I was doing my gender reveal.\n\nThis was all overwhelming and I told her that a baby shower wasn\u2019t happening because it didn\u2019t interest me. I reminded her that only two pictures were given at scans and the rest had to be paid for if I wanted more and that I was happy to purchase one for her and my grandparents but that is it and as far as gender reveals to my partner and I had planned something intimate between the two of us and we would just tell everyone else when we were ready.\n\nShe was upset by this but left it alone. That was until today when she called me and tried to push the idea of a shower and gender reveal again saying my aunts and cousins were upset that I didn\u2019t want to include them in my pregnancy and that I should really think about how the family feels.\n\nI exploded which I regret slightly and told her that her constant arguments with her sisters when I was growing up meant that I didn\u2019t know my aunts or my cousins well and that my pregnancy (again this is my FIRST) was something that I wanted to enjoy with the people closest in my life. I told her I was happy to bring the baby to my grandparents once a week after I have settled into motherhood and that everyone is welcome to come and be part of my child\u2019s life and that I am not trying to cut them out of it but since they are practically strangers to me I wanted to do everything at my own pace.\nShe got upset and cried saying I was horrible for accusing her of making me feel estranged from my family and now she isn\u2019t answering my calls.\n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t have snapped but the last few weeks I feel like every decision surrounding my pregnancy has been taken away from me. I didn\u2019t get to announce it to anyone except my mum and now I\u2019m feeling pressured into trying to please everyone.

Period.\n\nYou're the pregnant one: you set the pace, you put the boundaries, you decide.

If they want to get the baby gifts, they know where to send them to. Very simple. Good Luck OP! And Congratulations", "No NTA, you told your mother exactly what she needed to hear.", "ESH a bit. I think she's totally in the wrong to make your pregnancy about her family and not you, and depriving you of the chance to share the news is really selfish and thoughtless, so she's more in the wrong. But it doesn't sound like you'd want to do all the big group party type events with them even if you HAD spent more time together in childhood, and tons of people don't stay close to aunts and uncles as adults anyway, so blaming her parenting for you not wanting to do a thing you probably wouldn't want to do regardless is going for the jugular.

Have your partner run interference if necessary.", "NTA I'd let them throw the party though, baby shit is expensive.", "NTA. Your mother and her sisters made their choice to be at odds throughout their kids' early years, and this is the result. Families like that feed on anger, feed on controversy and having someone to blame for their unhappiness\u2014and you are a smart woman to stay the heck away from that. Congrats on your pregnancy\u2014and for taking control here.", "NTA She's a narcissist. Be careful about letting her into your child's life, some states have laws that allow grandparents to sue for legal rights.", "NTA and now we know why her and your aunts didn\u2019t get along for long at the time.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour mom is the Ah here.", "Yeah same opinion, it's your pregnancy, plus having seen two of my wife, not giving breathing space to a pregnant woman is textbook assholery", "I'd leave towards NTA, but you might want to apologize to your mum for blaming her like that. It was a bit harsh.\n\nIf you do apologise, though, do it in the same message where you set boundaries. Don't let her use the apology as a reason to double down on her poor behaviour.", "NTA.

NTA", "I hate it when moms do that shit. You call them out on their bullshit and they start crying. Its manipulative. My mom thinks we have this great relationship because we don't argue like we did when I was little, but thats only because I left home when I was 18. God forbid I bring up how she raised me, just yelling at me all the time, because then she'll start crying. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nA bit hormonal maybe, but your mom is not empathic at all, even with her own daughter.", "NTA. You are a pregnant woman, who does not need a lot of family stress in your life. You mom has created long term strains in the family and is trying to use your pregnancy to patch things up. She told you how she wanted you to go about this. You told her no. She wouldn't take no for an answer and escalated her pressure on you. You lost your temper. Which simply means that you are a typical human being who is subject to being rude when pushed hard enough and long enough about something. Don't worry, it probably was good for her to hear it. Just focus on growing that baby and if you have to go LC with her until she is willing to be reasonable.", "NTA and if the way your mother is handling this disagreement with you is indicative of the way she handles disagreements with her sibs than I don't wonder that she's so frequently estranged from them.", "NTA.  The first mistake was telling your mother. Should have sent a Facebook announcement a hot second before you told her. \n\nI think your aunts are not the ones demanding a baby shower or gender reveal. It's just your mother. I also don't think they want a baby scan. I'm sure they're excited for you, but extended family don't usually get scan photos.", "yes,set boundaries now before mom tries to outgrandma her sisters if they have grandkids or brag 'im the 1st grandma'if they dont..", "NTA \n\nNo you did good. You are wise and she is the one trying to use you and your baby for her own benefit. \n\nShe is the one that messed up you relationship with aunts and cousins and your baby is not some peace dove being passed around.

What an immature woman. I didn't get my way concerning your baby so now I will cry. That act would make me keep my distance.", "She doesn't need \"one more warning\" she's got a lifetime record of tromping on boundaries as it is.\n\nInformation diet, OP can tell everyone she wants to tell about her latest updates and then tell her mother.", "Exactly this! Establish your boundaries now before she takes it upon herself to announce when the baby is born. And takes over all the other firsts. \nIf you don't put your foot down now, you have constant battles ahead.", "Exactly. You get to choose how you want things to go. However, you will need stuff that costs a lot. You will appreciate having extra help, and having a baby shower is a great way to get people invested. They want to plan a baby shower? Great! Tell them you will only make a list of the things you want and not throw in a single penny since you did not want one and let them plan and buy everything. No gender reveal", "She tried that and her Mom used the whole BUT FAAAMMILYYY!!
