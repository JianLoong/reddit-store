People with disabilities often develop dark humor, because otherwise they won't have many opportunities to laugh.", "YTA. She's not doing anything wrong. She's the one with epilepsy.

She can joke about it all she wants as a coping mechanism. \n\nDark humor works like that. Makes other people uncomfortable but some people understand. Personally I think she\u2019s hilarious cause I would laugh at those.", "**NAH**\n\nI've been disabled by multiple serious chronic illnesses for longer than you and your girlfriend have been alive, and I was initially going to give this a \"gentle Y-T-A\" and explain to you that while I understood your upset, that you were being a little bit of an AH by trying to police her way of coping with her illness, which is really harmless and sometimes even necessary when you're a young person dealing with the VERY stressful, exhausting realities of chronic illness - especially something like a seizure disorder, which can involve things that end up being publicly humiliating on top of everything else.\n\nBut here's the thing . . . when I stopped and really thought about it? My initial assessment was wrong. I don't think you are policing her or her feelings. It sounds like you are just expressing to her that, because you love her so much, you are just not in a place where you're comfortable joking about her illness yet. And . . . that's also valid.\n\nI don't think there are any AHs in this situation. I think it's important for you to try to understand that your GF isn't actually making light of the seriousness of her epilepsy or being an AH, that her jokes ARE a coping mechanism - and that IS a serious thing - and one that is really important, healthy, and used by many disabled/chronically ill people to help us \"lighten the mental load\" so-to-speak of having to live in bodies that do not cooperate with us. If we had to be super serious about our illnesses and limitations 24/7, our lives would be miserable, and no one can live like that. We learn to crack jokes because mostly the discomfort, and worrying about whether we're going to fall down in the middle of a store and hit our heads, and all of the myriad worrisome nonsense is DRAINING . . . we need to be able to joke to hold depression at bay and stay emotionally healthy. But it's okay if it takes you some time to be okay with that. Just, for her sake, maybe try?", "YTA. I have epilepsy. Joking about it helps me, because epilepsy sucks. We all know it sucks. And my seizures aren't well known by the general public (absence and focal aware) which doesn't help me feel less isolated about it. It's her coping mechanism, and it's not hurting anyone. Just let her do her thing.", "YTA she has epilepsy. She\u2019s allowed to joke about it. Stop policing her speech.", "YTA. She's dealing with it the best way she knows how. I worked with a guy that had it. Said if he ever had a seizure just put him in the back room and let it pass.", "Soft YTA, If she has straight up told you this is her coping mechanism you need to give her the support she needs to get to wherever she needs to be. A jokes just a joke but this is something she needs to work and not be told to just stop doing.", "LOL. She is funny.\n\nNAH, depending how you move forward on this.\n\nFor a lot of people (including myself) dark humour helps a lot letting go of the fact that there are just things that are relatively out of our control. It's the difference between living your life in dread, or just allowing yourself to accept your own reality.\n\nI can understand from your perspective watching someone or the idea of watching someone you really care about go through something like that is not a \"fun\" thing. However she is the one that ultimately has to deal with it physically.\n\nIf it helps her cope with it, I think you should be supportive. Once you enter a relationship with someone, there are personal adjustments you have to make. I think it's a fair ask.\n\nFor me this would be a thing I would end a relationship over if my partner could not accept it, so I think its worthwhile to establish for yourself how important it is.\n\nShe would have every right to end the relationship if this is something you can't move yourself on, so choose wisely.

Making those types of jokes can help normalize the situation and help someone feel less self conscious and weird. \n\nPutting her illness in the category of too serious to joke about makes it feel like a bigger, scarier thing than it has to be. \n\nIf it really bothers you, you can ask her not to make those jokes around you.

All he said was she indicated that it was her coping mechanism, he didn't care, and demanded she stop.\n\nWhen it's a conversation, you ask someone to stop. When it's a demand, you tell them to stop. \"AITA for *telling her* to quit making seizure jokes?\" The one making the assumption is you, because nowhere in the entire OP did he say anything about having a conversation. All he said was he told her to stop.", "Wait wait wait.\n\nIs \"spacing out\" as a turn of phrase derived from something epilepsy related??", ">No he isn't\n\nOther's doing an action that involves you requires your consent.", "You should hear us in the infusion center, we're down right morbid most of the time.", "i almost cried reading this. so so happy that your outcome from surgery is so positive!! hugs from an internet stranger w/ joint issues :)", "I never said you or anybody else couldn't make jokes. I just acknowledged that OP's feelings are understandable and he should try to have an appropriate conversation with his partner. Please don't put words in my mouth.\n\nOP should talk to his gf and they should address both of their feelings. Maybe it leads to a happy resolution, maybe it's a deal breaker and they're just not compatible. What happens is between them. My comment about ignoring OP's feelings was directed at the comment and the others like it, not OP's gf. Maybe that's where the confusion is?\n\nAs for my brother having a worse time than me, i really doubt that. Being dead seems like a pretty sweet gig these days.", "Fully just accidentally inhaled my wine, but it was worth it for that joke.", "I guess I'm just not reading into the word choice as deeply as  you are. You're treating a short summary written for reddit like it's a detailed transcript of their conversation. I tend to take things much less literally, especially when there's so little to go off of.", "Yes? I have absence seizures", "Me making a joke about *my* illness that *I* deal with to cope with *my* mortality and disability is not my problem if anyone else doesn't like it.\n\nI don't need anyone else's consent to make a joke about myself.\n\nIf you don't like it, leave the room.

I\u2019m hugging you a little harder.", "Sorry, I think I wasn't clear.\n\nI know that \"spaz\" is directly referencing a seizure. I thought \"spacing out\" might have a direct link as well, as in, the phrase exists because it was once describing something about epilepsy.", ">Me making a joke about my illness that I deal with to cope with my mortality and disability is not my problem if anyone else doesn't like it.\n\nIt is your problem when you do it to other people who do not consent to it. This is like Human Decency 101.\n\n>I don't need anyone else's consent to make a joke about myself.\n\nYou do in their presence. That this consent is usually given or, if not, then not complained about, does not change this.\n\n>If you don't like it, leave the room. Simple.\n\nExactly, that is one possible outcome.\n\n>Would you like me to get your consent before having a seizure as well?\n\nOnly if you have seizures intentionally.\n\n>I know that might be scary for you.

One of the types of seizures I have is I space out, stare straight ahead, smack my lips and my arm jerks.\n\nI'm gone for about four minutes or more, and my teachers in kindergarten noticed it. Or I would be crossing the street and just stop walking.\n\nBut if you don't know me, you'd think I was just daydreaming and off in my own world", "I'd say NAH because I imagine you're not well acquainted with disability jokes and it makes sense to be uncomfortable. When it comes to people with disabilities, we tend to joke bc it brings a sense of comfort (or community when on online forums or with others) for example I make autism jokes about myself and other autistic people may chuckle and go \"mood\" etc. This doesn't have to be just disabilities as well, it can be race jokes, trauma jokes, etc. Punching sideways? I guess you could say so. I'd say have a conversation about your discomfort but realize ultimately if she wants to continue making those jokes she can.

It originates from the scientific term for a form of cerebral palsy. Honestly, I'm not sure what the consensus is on whether both communities have claim to the term or not."]}
