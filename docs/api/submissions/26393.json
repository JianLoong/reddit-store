Wow...\n\nNTA", "NTA  \nHonestly it sounds like she doesn't trust him- and I wouldn't either.   \n\n\nFrankly, if my ex called me talking about our daughter like that? I'd be petitioning for full custody.   \nIt sounds like he treats her like a servant and that's not OK.", "No, you are turning her into a young lady that has an idea of her self worth and doesn\u2019t want to be taken for granted.\n\nThat is a *good* thing. It will keep her from being a pushover people pleaser and stop her from being taken advantage of. NTA", "NTA - He sounds like a pig.", "NTA\n\nYou're teaching her that she doesn't belong to men to treat however they want. \n\nShe does these things with you because she respects you. He hasn't earned respect.", "NTA. Your ex is pretty much just staying true to form, no? Your marriage ended in part due to his entitlement and sexism, which he is now applying to your daughter. I suggest you show your support to her and try to stick up for her to him if you can. Eventually - maybe it's now? - she will be able to decide if she wishes to spend any time with him. I'm guessing, sadly, that she dreads her weekends with him if she feels belittled and 'hides' in her room. Keep doing what you're doing.", "NTA - I would also start documenting these issues and have full custody papers on hand. As she gets to her teen years it will likely get much worse.", "NTA, good for you for teaching your daughter to look out for herself and demand the respect she deserves.", "NTA\n\nalso might be grounds to re-negotiate the custody agreement if he views your daughter as a servant, instead of his own child", "NTA. He thinks he has a right to treat her like that? Seriously? His 13 (approximately) year old daughter? \n\nThat he chooses to spend his little bit of time with her acting like that and choosing to complain about her like that says a lot about him. He does sound like an entitled jerk.\n\nMajor props to you though for teaching her that she doesn\u2019t have to take it. She doesn\u2019t seem disrespectful but rather seems like she just tried to stay out of his way.\n\nStill it\u2019s so sad that\u2019s what she has to experience with her father.", "NTA sounds like he expects his daughter to be his maid and she\u2019s standing up for herself", "NTA, time to go back to court.

My mom did the exact same thing to me and will still call me and ask me to come clean and I haven\u2019t lived at home for years", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like you are doing things right and he is not, which is why she\u2019s receptive to you and not him. He can\u2019t blame his own problems on you or her. If he wants her to \u201cact better\u201d around him he needs to treat her with the respect she deserves. Aka he is the one that needs to change, if he can\u2019t figure it out he should try therapy. Make sure your daughter feels comfortable telling you what happens with her dad, there should be no fear of you being upset with her. Even though you are not together anymore you are still parents that must work as a team, because you have a child together, and you have to figure out how to help him be the dad she needs him to be. If that\u2019s not possible maybe things should change to be in the best interests of the child, who is really the most important person in this situation.", "NTA. You're not raising a brat, you're raising your daughter to know her worth, and to not be anyone's servant. So instead of dad ensuring they have quality time together he is more concerned with her coming to clean and cook for him, smh. Where's his gf/wife/S.O? If he needs help around his home, he should hire someone. Instead of whining about his daughter not playing maid, he should come up with some fun things for them to do before she is old enough to say I am not going over there. NTA. He'll live and good for you and your daughter!", "If this is an accurate description: NTA", "NTA. He needs to develop a better relationship with her, as you have. Then those other things will come. But there is a give and take- if he will get up and get her a glass of water when she asks, then she will do the same.", "NTA. She's thirteen. If he wants food cooked, he needs to cook it.", "NTA.  If your ex keeps it up he's not going to ever see his daughter the second she can get away from court ordered visitation.", "NTA  Misogynist much. I can see why you divorced him! Maybe explain to him that his daughter is not his slave and that that is why you are divorced and if he keeps this up then she will go NC when she has the chance and he needs to grow up and learn what is a real man!", "Very misleading title. You know you're in the right here. The post isn't really necessary, or for this sub.", "YTA and the world is going to fuck up your daughter. Parents order kids around and demand shit that is totally normal. Someone in a position of authority tells you to do something you do it. Raising kids your way is how we get people that turn traffic stops into felonies. For her sake I really hope that she isn't black or poor.", "Why do both you guys make your daughter \u201cfetch you water\u201d?", "YTA. Not bc you raised a brat, but because you and your baby daddy clearly aren\u2019t on the same page about what to expect from your daughter and where boundaries should lie. And because you\u2019re her primary then you do have much more influence in this. \n\nI don\u2019t think he\u2019s wrong to expect his daughter to do as he says (within legal bounds ofc). Wether she wants to or not... she is his daughter and he as a parent has authority over her. \n\nI\u2019d be willing to guess there\u2019s more to this story, and likely you\u2019ve helped to shape your daughters perspective of her father. Her actions show she clearly doesn\u2019t respect him as a parent.\n\n\u201cIn my home, I teach my daughter kindness is valued but servitude is not\u201d. This is awful to read, as acts of service are often also acts of love. It\u2019s how I often express love to my partner. If you\u2019ve ever been in a real loving relationship you\u2019d understand this- but instead you\u2019re likely letting your own past relationship traumas influence how you shape your daughter\u2019s world and how she views her father. \n\nAnyone who needs a username like \u201cnotabadmom\u201d raises many red flags. You probably know deep down inside that you\u2019re at least partly at fault here but sounds like you wouldn\u2019t accept it as you actively try to portray yourself as a good mom. \n\nAlso, when she\u2019s mature and enters the real world- she\u2019s going to have to do things for people she doesn\u2019t necessarily like. She\u2019s going to have managers who aren\u2019t nice, who speak in tones she finds disrespectful, and it\u2019s probably better for her to learn to suck it up and deal with it now versus when real adult life comes around.", "Your daughter is a brat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
