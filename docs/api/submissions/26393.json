Make sure your daughter feels comfortable telling you what happens with her dad, there should be no fear of you being upset with her.

Wether she wants to or not... she is his daughter and he as a parent has authority over her. \n\nI\u2019d be willing to guess there\u2019s more to this story, and likely you\u2019ve helped to shape your daughters perspective of her father. Her actions show she clearly doesn\u2019t respect him as a parent.\n\n\u201cIn my home, I teach my daughter kindness is valued but servitude is not\u201d. This is awful to read, as acts of service are often also acts of love. It\u2019s how I often express love to my partner. If you\u2019ve ever been in a real loving relationship you\u2019d understand this- but instead you\u2019re likely letting your own past relationship traumas influence how you shape your daughter\u2019s world and how she views her father. \n\nAnyone who needs a username like \u201cnotabadmom\u201d raises many red flags. You probably know deep down inside that you\u2019re at least partly at fault here but sounds like you wouldn\u2019t accept it as you actively try to portray yourself as a good mom. \n\nAlso, when she\u2019s mature and enters the real world- she\u2019s going to have to do things for people she doesn\u2019t necessarily like. She\u2019s going to have managers who aren\u2019t nice, who speak in tones she finds disrespectful, and it\u2019s probably better for her to learn to suck it up and deal with it now versus when real adult life comes around.", "Your daughter is a brat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
