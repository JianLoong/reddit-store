Wether she wants to or not... she is his daughter and he as a parent has authority over her. \n\nI\u2019d be willing to guess there\u2019s more to this story, and likely you\u2019ve helped to shape your daughters perspective of her father. Her actions show she clearly doesn\u2019t respect him as a parent.\n\n\u201cIn my home, I teach my daughter kindness is valued but servitude is not\u201d. This is awful to read, as acts of service are often also acts of love. It\u2019s how I often express love to my partner. If you\u2019ve ever been in a real loving relationship you\u2019d understand this- but instead you\u2019re likely letting your own past relationship traumas influence how you shape your daughter\u2019s world and how she views her father. \n\nAnyone who needs a username like \u201cnotabadmom\u201d raises many red flags. You probably know deep down inside that you\u2019re at least partly at fault here but sounds like you wouldn\u2019t accept it as you actively try to portray yourself as a good mom. \n\nAlso, when she\u2019s mature and enters the real world- she\u2019s going to have to do things for people she doesn\u2019t necessarily like. She\u2019s going to have managers who aren\u2019t nice, who speak in tones she finds disrespectful, and it\u2019s probably better for her to learn to suck it up and deal with it now versus when real adult life comes around.", "Your daughter is a brat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You just said she was 8 at the time of the divorce, anyhow your ex is a dick, he's the AH. She's his kid not his servant. I'd ask if she still wants to go over there. I know I wouldn't and it wouldn't be because I'm a brat. It would be the shitty energy your ex brings to the table. NTA.", "sounds a lot like the relationship i had with my dad, though they were still together in the beginning. it wasn't that i was unwilling to do what he asked or had an attitude, i was just scared of him. he blamed my mom for 'taking my side'. \n\nafter the divorce when i was around your daughters age, things got even worse. entitled sexist men will only stomach their daughters so long as they are young enough to mirror their own beliefs. once they become independent young women, their own daughter's only a threat to their ego rather than the innocent child she is. he got physical as i got older and had the urge to protect my siblings from his harsh words. my mom's complacency in the situation meant even though he was out of her house, *my* only escape was once i got old enough to have a say in the courts to end overnights and started skipping visits. i haven't seen or spoken to him in years and wouldn't know him if i saw him.\n\nsome men are pigs who never deserved daughters, and daughters who do not deserve them. NTA. i hope you continue raising your daughter to know and demand the respect she's due.", "OP - there is a reason he is an EX and this is just a reminder I think... Instead of doing these things like cooking and chores with her as a bonding thing, he's taking advantage of the fact that you've taught her how to be an adult - things appropriate for her age, and is using it or trying to. The fact that he isn't leaving her alone is a minor miracle.\n\nIt might be time to revisit how he spends time with her. In the US she can have a child advocate assigned to her and they can monitor parent time, they can also be another person they can talk to about things. Yes, they do have a duty to report. At the moment your ex hasn't done anything officially wrong unless he used language that she/you didn't mention.\n\nShe can request at her age less time with a parent at her age or will soon- in the USA\n\nEDIT- NTA", "NTA.\n\nAsk your ex if your daughter were born a son, would he be demanding that his son do the things he ordered your daughter to do?

I don't order her to do that in any point of time. \n\nShe almost always honors the request. And if she doesn't, it's still fine. I would like it, but I don't act like I am entitled to it. And it's extremely rare, mostly when she is also tuckered out and giving me fake evil eye. \nWe are cool. She knows that. \n\nIt doesn't seem to be that way at ex's house.

Why would you order your kid to get you water when you can, I dunno, be a nice person and just ask? Would you demand a friend to give you water or would you politely ask? Probably the later bc it's the nice, polite thing to do that doesn't make ppl angry at you for being rude and mannerless. \n\nI mean, you can see how well behaved the daughter is at OP's house, right? Bc OP nurtures their relationship and maintains trust and respect without abusing her power of authority. That's the funny thing about respect: if you give it, you'll receive it in turn.
