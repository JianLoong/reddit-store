A little background\u00a0I'm a 23-year-old girl who has a passion for photography. It's my escape, my passion, and a way for me to preserve the precious moments in life. Presenting Madison (24F), a friend from my childhood, and Layla (25F), Madison's friend, who I don't really know well. The truth is, I lent Madison my pricey camera a few months ago for a weekend trip she was taking. We've been close for a very long time, so I didn't think it would be a big deal when she told me she would take great care of it. Guess what, though? On her trip, she lost it.Then, last week, Madison contacted me once more. She asked to borrow my new camera, saying she and Layla were planning another trip. Yes, the same pair that lost the previous one. Despite the fact that I'm not Sherlock Holmes, if you fool me twice, you should feel ashamed. You see what I mean. After giving it some thought, I told Madison the truth. I informed her that, in light of the previous incident, I didn't feel comfortable lending my new camera. I told them how much that camera meant to me\u2014both emotionally and financially. I was afraid I would misplace something else important.Madison did not react well to it. She claimed that Layla was unrelated to the earlier incident, that I was being unfair, and that I should trust her. Layla added that she would take extra precautions and that they would replace it if something went wrong.\r  \n\r  \nBut Reddit, this is where I need your opinion. AITA for standing my ground and declining to give them my camera once more? I feel bad for not believing my friend, but I also can't get rid of my fear that the past will repeat itself.

It remains entirely their responsibility.\n\nIn a case of simple, non-negligent loss, the person who lost the thing owes the person whose thing it was simple liability - just the cost of the item.  The fact that it wasn't their fault is why they only owe you the value of the object.  If it *was* their fault, either through negligence or malice, then they would owe you value *plus* damages.\n\nI am speaking ethically and morally here - different legal codes may have different specific implementations of these rules.
