In the meantime, I was okay with him staying there.   We've been dating for a year amd felt the time was right.   I received a call from my brother asking where the large piggy back full of coins that was in my son's room went?  Long story short, this \"man\" went into my son's room, took the piggy bank, amd proceeded to take all the money except the pennies.  When I confronted him about it, his excuse was he fell on hard times and was too embarrassed to ask.  He stated that he was.going to pay it back.  Needless to say I went off on him because you stole from my child.  This is the second time I noticed that money from piggy banks have cleared out with not even one word.  I didn't say anything th first which was my mistake, but never did I think he would stoop this low.  I promptly asked him to pack his stuff and leave my house.\n\nEdit:  Thanks to everyone who has replied.  I just needed a sanity check because i was definitely feeling a little guilty about putting him out.", "created_utc": 1694356735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16f1vsp/aita_for_kicking_my_boyfriend_out_for_stealing/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good for you for kicking his ass to the curb, but it shouldn't have been after the second time, it should have been after the first!! He should have been open and honest with you, not sneaking around and stealing from kids. Don't let this clown back into your life, who knows what else he'll do and steal from your home when he's hard up for money.", "NTA, stick to your guns. This is a major red flag.", "NTA.  The only guilt here is on the former bf.  To this day, in my froggy bank (I'm 52 and it's older than I am), I have a penny coin wrapper.  Written on it in pencil is \"I owe you $108.\"  Yeah, that's right.  Things were really tight for my parents when I was born and I was sick a lot which didn't help.  Dad would go to work early on pay day, cash his check, buy diapers, formula, etc. and drop them at home on his way to work (mom was stuck on unpaid maternity leave - I was born in the early 70s and their company had a policy that you had to take six weeks off before and after the baby), then go back to the bank at lunch time and put whatever was left of his check in the bank.\n\nThanks to my grandparents, great-grandparents, and various aunts and uncles, I had a healthy balance in my savings account.  Once, when things were tighter than usual and dad was too embarrassed to ask for help, they borrowed $108 from my savings.  That money has long since been paid back, but we still laugh about that IOU.  That's what a man does when he falls on hard times.", "Nta. You don't need to be involved with a thief. He is just not worth the trouble.  Millions of other men out there.  No problem for you finding a good one. This is a man that stole your child's money. Why would you even question your kicking him out????", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
