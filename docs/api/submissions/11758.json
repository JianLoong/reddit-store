And not only that, I would have been distressed.\n\nWhen you\u2019re pregnant your body becomes some object of public speculation, people feel entitled to touch it and talk about it and judge it. \n\nThe adult woman who has a fully developed personality and has educated herself and supported herself and built relationships and businesses and has opinions on politics and human rights and everything imaginable takes a back seat and you\u2019re suddenly an increasingly large, uncomfortable, probably slightly nervous baby maker. People you don\u2019t know share things with you that you don\u2019t want to hear. They reminisce about their pregnancies and how they look back on it all fondly and tell you that one day you will too.

My advice would be to apologize, sincerely (i.e., admit fault for breaching a boundary) and going forward you should be ultra-conservative about what you say concerning other people. If in doubt, don\u2019t let it out.

Not sure if this is your first experience with pregnancy, but she is going to have a LOT of things happen that feel weird for her.

My partner got me home safely, apparently I had struggles walking straight and standing still without leaning against something. When I was better the next day we laughed about it.\n\nNext time we were out with my close friends we would all share some of our \"stupid stuff we did when drunk/tipsy\" stories and he would bring up *my* blackout night like 3 times making fun of how I stumbled or almost fell over when he tried to unlock the door etc. I got up and left at some point. I cried the whole way home not because I was embarrassed in front of my friends but because it hurt to sit and watch the person you love humiliate you in public and thinking nothing was wrong with that. \n\nWe almost broke up over it and now, 6 years later, I still say that this was the most hurtful thing he has ever done to me. Because if you are in an intimate relationship and support each other at your weakest moments it comes with some unspoken rule of confidentiality. You don't make fun on the others expense *especially* about something embarassing when the other one was vulnerable. It's up to the person to share or not share it.\n\nAnd this was just me getting piss drunk out of free will and as a consequence of my bad decisions. Now if I imagine the same scenario would happen to me but instead the reason  behind my unfortunate situation would be a *pregnancy with twins* and the father of those kids would do this... I would be extremely hurt. I hope you make up for it. \n\nYTA", "YTA! Never embarrass your partner. Either you're clueless or trying verry hard to play innocent.", "That\u2019s embarrassing.
