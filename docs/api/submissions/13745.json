He is capable of working and living a normal life, it sounds like your mom coddled him and gave you the tough love he needed.", "NTA!\r  \nAs an ADHDer who was recently diagnosed with ASD myself (this Jan. aged 36 - ADHD was diagnosed about 30 years ago), I have learned loads! I had already diagnosed myself about 1.5 years before my actual diagnosis (I was diagnosed with Aspergers myself even though technnically that term is no longer used - also, don't be fooled when they call it 'high functioning autism' because it is really 'high masking autism!).\r  \n\r  \nI was not shocked to hear you too have ASD as autism is hereditary. That means that one or both of your parents have it too (at least one of your grandparents, etc.) and every likelihood you ever pass it down to your children. \r  \n\r  \nWomen are often misdiagnosed (doctors prefer to give you the whole alphabet in acronym-disorders before even entertaining the idea of ASD) or undiagnosed. This is because women in general are much better at masking that boys/men; this is also because masking for women/girls is often expected by society. That, combined with the outdated views people have of autism, means it is a nightmare to be diagnosed as a female. Initially, I never thought I could be autistic (even when I started suspecting it) because \"I look people in the eye\"...it was not until I started to pay attention that I realised I DO look people in the eye, but a) it makes me cringe and b) I am constantly thinking \"when do I look away, when do I look back, how intense do I stare\"? This caused me to not even pay attention to what people were telling me because I was so busy doing that. That is when the penny dropped. \r  \n\r  \nYou say that your brother is lazy. I would like to add caution to that. ADHD and ASD are what is called 'comorbidities', meaning: often (not always) if you have one, you have the other (this can also be with other things like dyslexia, basically everything that fall under the category 'neurodiversity'). Now, I am not saying your brother has ADHD as well (his behaviour could be simply coddling from your mother and/or him abusing his autism), but I am just saying this to make you aware it is a possibility. Trust me when I say that what is called 'executive dysfunction' is a nightmare! And it is something that looks very much like being lazy. I can sometimes seem lazy, yet the biggest difference is; I WANT to do the task, I simply just CAN'T because my brain won't allow it. I'll give you a simple example (something that happened a while ago, but repeats itself often). I was making dinner one night and told myself that when I finish, I'll have to go and take a shower. I finish eating, finish my episode (and to let my food go down), shut my laptop and just sat there...for 30 MINUTES, telling myself constantly (OUT LOUD) to get up off the chair and go and take a shower. I literally could not get up. It is hard to explain it, but it's like there is this huge disconnect between your brain and body. And just like that, I snapped out of it (still frustrated as hell) and I could go and do my thing.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, procrastination is a HUGE deal with ADHD! \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI don't know if that is the same for your brother (again, it might be just coddling, or perhaps a combination of ADHD and coddling). It might just be worth trying to figure it out. At least for ADHD he can take medication (should he want to) that could help with some things in his life. \r  \n\r  \nWhat I will say though: do NOT think you owe him anything! It is not your job to look after him, especially when you have enough on your plate as it is, with your own ASD. Blood does not equal a must when it comes to care. It is up to your mother and brother to make sure he has the support he needs to be(come) independent. With autism comes people pleasing, but I urge you to not please them in this instance, that is not your job. Your brother does seem to be capable of relatively normal living: he did have 3 jobs, meaning that, with the right support, he can find work that is accommodating for him and the rest he can gain with support. \r  \n\r  \nAgain, NTA, but just don't blame your brother for his behaviour though. This is the autism (maybe ADHD?) and certainly your mother's coddling that made him this way. Just also don't feel obliged to think that he is in any way your responsibility!

However, too many parents don't teach them to, because they infantilise their autistic child. And so, they use the 'they're autistic' excuse for their child. Of course the autistic child will remain dependant on others for simple household chores. After all, why would they do domestic labour if nobody ever taught them to, and if someone else is doing it for them?\n\nIn the Netherlands, there is a popular documentary about a man who is almost 50. His parents are around 80. He lives with them and gets spoiled by them. Do I blame him? No. I blame his parens. They were worried about what would happen if they were gone. Well, they should have done that before they were well into their 80s. They should have helped their son to become more independent at a much younger age. However, especially his mother was unable to let him go. She didn't want him to become more independent.\n\nFortunately, your brother is probably not as extreme as the man in this movie, but the situation is quite similar. And you see this with quite some autistic people. Even if they would be capable of doing more things by themselves, they are often dependant on their parents because their parents keep them in a dependant role.\n\nIf your mother taught him how to behave properly, gave him a fair share of chores and taught him how to do those... Then, your brother would not be in this situation.\n\nYour brother doesn't know any better, because he has never been taught to know any better. It's a little late to teach him now.

And she never knew and still doesn't believe that you are autistic, while knowing that your brother is, so she felt like your brother should be excused from behaving properly and from doing any domestic labour.\n\nHowever, it's not too late. You need to make it very clear to your mother that you are not going to be a caregiver in the future, and that you are no longer doing any chores for him. Tell her that you will move out as soon as you are able to, which will force your mother to make do without you. Tell her that she will have to assign your brother chores and teach him how to behave before she is gone.\n\nYes, your mother will get angry.

If you refuse, she will realise that you are serious.\n\nHopefully, she will do what she should have done ten, fifteen years ago. Hopefully, she will teach your brother to do things that he should be perfectly capabe of.\n\nSadly, if you move out, she will probably do all the chores while your brother does nothing.
