No way that I will EVER ask her to take care of him. The only thing I told him, is that he can always ask her questions or advice. It's our job as a parent to teach them and help them become the best adult they can. Not to burden a child with his sibling for the rest of their life.

People with it hold down jobs, wash their own clothes and dishes, make their own food, socialize, date, get married, have kids and do all of the things considered a \"normal life\".

They've neglected to help him understand social environments, responsibility, accountability, respect, and that will have lasting consequences. You don't deserve to bear the burden of ANY of those consequences, and you've been deprived of a healthy home environment through your child. You have EVERY right to be angry, every right to stick up for yourself and refuse having the burden pushed onto you once more. \n\nYou were right to say it that way, and I'd argue that you could say much more, much more harshly, because somehow they still don't understand that teaching a child-now-adult to be entirely reliant on others is a terrible mistake.\n\nI wish you the best of luck for the future, and hope you can get into a more healthy environment soon.", "NTA.

From what you're saying, he does seem very impaired by his autism but still has the ability to try. \"Weaponized incompetence\" seems a bit hurtful to a person with autism, but I understand it's hard to say kind things when you're being pushed to your limits. It might also be true, for all I know.\n\nFact is, taking care of your brother isn't your responsibility and you have your own life ahead of you. Your mother is worried about your brother and coddles him too much. She sees you as the responsible one. Still, I wouldn't take on the responsibility of caring for him. He needs to help out more and try to take care of himself.\n\nI don't want what you take away from this to be resentment.

There are actual live in facilities specifically built for those who are autistic or otherwise handicapped. They teach people who otherwise could barely function how to carry out simple jobs, like restocking vending machines and dressing themselves. Your mother needs to learn that people with all kinds of disabilities are capable of taking care of themselves if they are properly taught and motivated.", "NTA. He is capable of working and living a normal life, it sounds like your mom coddled him and gave you the tough love he needed.", "NTA!\r  \nAs an ADHDer who was recently diagnosed with ASD myself (this Jan. aged 36 - ADHD was diagnosed about 30 years ago), I have learned loads! I had already diagnosed myself about 1.5 years before my actual diagnosis (I was diagnosed with Aspergers myself even though technnically that term is no longer used - also, don't be fooled when they call it 'high functioning autism' because it is really 'high masking autism!).\r  \n\r  \nI was not shocked to hear you too have ASD as autism is hereditary. That means that one or both of your parents have it too (at least one of your grandparents, etc.) and every likelihood you ever pass it down to your children. \r  \n\r  \nWomen are often misdiagnosed (doctors prefer to give you the whole alphabet in acronym-disorders before even entertaining the idea of ASD) or undiagnosed. This is because women in general are much better at masking that boys/men; this is also because masking for women/girls is often expected by society. That, combined with the outdated views people have of autism, means it is a nightmare to be diagnosed as a female. Initially, I never thought I could be autistic (even when I started suspecting it) because \"I look people in the eye\"...it was not until I started to pay attention that I realised I DO look people in the eye, but a) it makes me cringe and b) I am constantly thinking \"when do I look away, when do I look back, how intense do I stare\"? This caused me to not even pay attention to what people were telling me because I was so busy doing that. That is when the penny dropped. \r  \n\r  \nYou say that your brother is lazy. I would like to add caution to that. ADHD and ASD are what is called 'comorbidities', meaning: often (not always) if you have one, you have the other (this can also be with other things like dyslexia, basically everything that fall under the category 'neurodiversity'). Now, I am not saying your brother has ADHD as well (his behaviour could be simply coddling from your mother and/or him abusing his autism), but I am just saying this to make you aware it is a possibility. Trust me when I say that what is called 'executive dysfunction' is a nightmare! And it is something that looks very much like being lazy. I can sometimes seem lazy, yet the biggest difference is; I WANT to do the task, I simply just CAN'T because my brain won't allow it. I'll give you a simple example (something that happened a while ago, but repeats itself often). I was making dinner one night and told myself that when I finish, I'll have to go and take a shower. I finish eating, finish my episode (and to let my food go down), shut my laptop and just sat there...for 30 MINUTES, telling myself constantly (OUT LOUD) to get up off the chair and go and take a shower. I literally could not get up. It is hard to explain it, but it's like there is this huge disconnect between your brain and body. And just like that, I snapped out of it (still frustrated as hell) and I could go and do my thing.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, procrastination is a HUGE deal with ADHD! \r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI don't know if that is the same for your brother (again, it might be just coddling, or perhaps a combination of ADHD and coddling). It might just be worth trying to figure it out. At least for ADHD he can take medication (should he want to) that could help with some things in his life. \r  \n\r  \nWhat I will say though: do NOT think you owe him anything! It is not your job to look after him, especially when you have enough on your plate as it is, with your own ASD. Blood does not equal a must when it comes to care. It is up to your mother and brother to make sure he has the support he needs to be(come) independent. With autism comes people pleasing, but I urge you to not please them in this instance, that is not your job. Your brother does seem to be capable of relatively normal living: he did have 3 jobs, meaning that, with the right support, he can find work that is accommodating for him and the rest he can gain with support. \r  \n\r  \nAgain, NTA, but just don't blame your brother for his behaviour though. This is the autism (maybe ADHD?) and certainly your mother's coddling that made him this way. Just also don't feel obliged to think that he is in any way your responsibility!

In other words, when your mom passes are you financially free to move out and get a room somewhere else or will you be stuck living with your brother until the lease runs out?\n\nIf you can move out sooner, that would be better for you.  If you're caring for your mom and don't want to leave her at this time, I can understand that.  Focus on saving money and having a mental plan for how you'll get out when the time comes.", "Sorry you're going through that. You're basically still a kid yourself, and it's not on you to take care of someone when you're trying to get your own life off the ground. The fact that you've basically been taken advantage of this entire time and now have an autism diagnosis yourself just makes the answer easier.", "It did need to be said and out there. You've already lost valuable time in your life and it's past time for the onus of your brother to be put elsewhere and for you to be able to spread your wings. Parents who enable one child at the expense of another do neither of them any favors. It's time for your mom to either get your brother into a program to learn activities of daily living or make arrangements for long term care. This should have been done years and years ago, but wasn't. Don't back down, he is your relative, but not your responsibility. After this long, your only responsibility is you, and to be the best that you can be - for yourself.", "He doesn't need a home. Aspergers isn't diagnosed anymore but it was always considered a high-functioning version of the disease. He needs to get of your mom's tit and grow up. \n\nIf something happens to her, let him learn to take care of himself.", "You know how on airplanes they say to put your own oxygen mask on first, then help others? That's because if you don't take care of yourself, there won't be a \"you\" left to help anyone else. I'm not saying you have to keep helping them. You're all 3 adults, and you'd be absolutely within your rights to just leave and never look back. But even if you do wNy to stay around and help them, it's really important to take care of yourself. Looking out for you is absolutely fine. Setting boundaries is a good thing.", "I can totally understand that, it\u2019s often why women don\u2019t get diagnosed as neurodivergent- I have ADHD diagnosed in adulthood and strongly suspect I am autistic but haven\u2019t gone for a diagnosis after one in my childhood told my mom \u201cgirls rarely have autism\u201d, which just isn\u2019t true but is a common reason why women are diagnosed in adulthood and are so adjusted to masking that they don\u2019t \u201cseem autistic\u201d to others. (My mom now understands this and has urged me to get a diagnosis now that she realizes that doctor was full of shit.) The more I learn and hear the voices of other autistic women, the more I realize how many things I\u2019ve struggled with that weren\u2019t visible but were just as difficult for me internally as the outward things were for other autistic people. I think it\u2019s important to note that just because it\u2019s harder to see it from the outside, you are no \u201cless autistic\u201d than your brother, but girls are notoriously conditioned to mask much more resulting in a much more internal display of struggles and quieter, \u201cless disruptive\u201d ways to deal with symptoms. I think you may want to try to make an effort to sit down and establish very clear boundaries with your mother, that include her treating you two equal from now on and responsible for equal tasks, and let her know you will not be accountable for your brother anymore- that responsibility will fall to him, and if she is set on infantilizing him, she can handle those tasks on her own. You went a lot more time without \u201cautism\u201d being the center of your mothers view and expectation of your functionality- it sounds like your brother has always been treated like he was autistic as his primary trait and been expected to function as such, and I wouldn\u2019t doubt it has stunted him in ways that have made him seem \u201cmore autistic\u201d in your mothers eyes.", "Congratulations on your sobriety. \n\nPlease make sure that you check local laws regarding whether or not your car repayment records count if your mother decides that you've merely been renting your car. \n\nMake sure that they are electronic payments and that on yhe reference field car purchase payment of $ amount with X owed in it. \n\nCheck that it can be legally reinforced. If you have a written agreement with her even better. \n\nShe's screwed you your whole life. Don't just take it on faith now.", "Ah that does explain a lot though, thank you for the clarification.\r  \n\r  \nAs for the not doing chores, I kinda get it, it is not my favorite thing to do either. But I do think that, while this is certainly and ADHD thing, it seems very much so that he has been enabled for too long. Once people stop the enabling, he will have to learn to do some of this himself (hopefully!) because there will be no one else to do it for him. It might take him a while, but he will get there in the end. And if not, that too is his problem and responsibility. He could always get an appropriate job and pay for a house keeper.\r  \n\r  \nI don't take medication for my ADHD either, but that is purely a personal choice. I hear too many horror stories and knowing it can take a long time to get the dosage right (and then shortages in the medication)...although sometimes I do wonder what life could be like if I did have proper working medication. \r  \n\r  \nI know your struggles being AuDHD, so know that you are not alone. Again, don't fall into the trap of people pleasing and don't let anyone guilt trip you into taking care of your brother. It does not sound like he is the severe type who needs round the clock care (and even so, there are people far better equipped to handle those situations than you). \r  \n\r  \nGood luck in everything you do, you got this, I believe in you!", "Also AFAB, also 24, also recently diagnosed, which was really just making it official\n\nI\u2019d spend recess walking in circles for fun. Lifetime fascination with industrial accidents and infrastructure. Middle school misanthrope logicbro who hated everyone around me. Really particular about clothing fabric. The overstimulation from loud music and bright lights were just \u201canxiety\u201d panics. Owns five pairs of the same converse.", "Not autism, but ADHD. I have a lot of sensory issues. As a kid I hated certain garments and food, still do, because of how they felt. What did my family do? Mocked me for acting like a \"princess\". Everyone thinks I was just being a spoiled brat but... How could I be spoiled when no one spoiled me? I was force fed and had to wear clothing my mom picked for me. I was being yelled at for being a crybaby.\n\nNo wonder I cried so much as I did when I was overwhelmed all the time!", "I didn\u2019t talk until 3 and I most definitely hid from people, I was shy as hell, had a hard time making friends, social cues right over my head and technically a few meltdowns in my life when I was too stressed. This is the reason why so many like you are undiagnosed-there\u2019s not severe enough symptoms soon enough because they look like some of us that were socially awkward. And it\u2019s truly only social awkwardness and being incredibly shy. But how do they differentiate you from me.? You who is on the spectrum but me who\u2019s not. It sucks because it leads to so many missed diagnosis. What needs to happen is to find a better way to test. More studies done which will hopefully lead to better testing. My meltdowns were triggered by harassment from the golden child and her friends. I didn\u2019t get therapy to learn how to deal with the stresses, I got punished for my behaviors and they stopped. Discipline an Autistic child for meltdowns and it doesn\u2019t work when they\u2019re overstimulated. My meltdowns weren\u2019t actual meltdowns but bad behavior that I had complete control over. But especially with kids I can see why it could get missed. It looks the same. I was tested and determined I was neurotypical. I have been evaluated enough times since that if I was on the spectrum it would be caught. It worked for me but failed for you!", "they were too loud LMAO", "Completely agree with you. It's ridiculous and something that needs to change. An ASD/ADHD male does not present the same as female. I have to explain this to so many people. Sadly we have not passed the stigmatism. As you said this goes for so many medical issues as well.", "what this person said, one of the big points Google mentioned", "Why on earth do you think I said they are popular?  Seriously what through your head ?  My point was very clear.", "I agree with this.  You should talk with your mom and brother about assisted or independent living options for your brother.\n\nMaybe if he knows what to expect he will take more interest in showing he is capable of independence.  He's the one who needs to be crystal clear on this.", "This. Please. Move several hours away.", "Oooh I love flighty/s That\u2019s what they used when they were trying to be nice lol. \n\nI also love the fact that I was a \u201cprincess\u201d in my muddy cargo shorts and vans. Yes, clearly the aesthetic is the important part here.", "Late in life ADHD diagnosis here. In school teachers called me too fidgety, refuses to focus for the whole class, quits listening while I'm talking, interrupts & procrastinates till the last minute. \n\nUhhh, yeah classic symptoms.", "Who was told they were rude for reading instead of socializing.\n\nWho wasn\u2019t allowed to talk about her interests because people don\u2019t want to hear about fun facts all the time.\n\n27, also AFAB. While not diagnosed, when I was tested and diagnosed with ADHD (which also has its own whole list of things I was punished and demeaned for), the psychologist told me I should also look into autism testing.", "I didn't get diagnosed until 26 and it's such a pain to even get that answer. I was bullied so hard for my freak outs and just treated as the weird kid", "Good for your parents for not backing down! \n\nThe doctor who diagnosed him knew within 30 minutes of our intake meeting that there was something. He asked about school and a 504/IEP and I commented that he didn\u2019t have one because he didn\u2019t have a diagnosis or anything that would qualify him for one \n\nThe doctor - having known my kid for 30 minutes - said to me \u201che will at the end of this.\u201d  It was there and clear to anyone who knew what to actually look for.", "I\u2019m in the same boat", "I was placed with a speecholgist from 2 to 10. I still have speech issues", "And, hell, that ends up fucking over men with the presentations more typically associated with women too. After all, your body knows chemicals, not social constructs, so women can have typically \"male\" presentations and men can have typically \"female\" presentations of various illnesses and disorders.\n\nThe patriarchy fucks everyone over yet again.", "Fine. Fixed it for you:\n\n> people will naturally like you\n\nLol. Why on earth do you think this? Seriously, what went through your head that led to you thinking \u201cOh hey, autistic women are ~~very popular~~ naturally liked, this is a thing that I have an informed opinion about\u201d?\n\nPeople do not \u201cnaturally like\u201d autistic and adhd girls, they find them/us irritating and off-putting, or pitiable at best.", "Procrastination?", "Oh yes!

And your peers avoid you like the plague.", "Mine was called speech therapy but in school only. My mother didn\u2019t have insurance before I was in school so I don\u2019t know if I should have been in sooner. But it took until 2nd grade. And I have some problems I can cover up good. I ad in therapy from 8-15 but I would be surprised if I had a speechologist.", "Omg, that\u2019s why I have imposter syndrome.\n\nAlso probably why this line from Fall Out Boy\u2019s new album hits so hard:\n> Do you laugh about me whenever I leave?\\\nOr do I just need more therapy?"]}
