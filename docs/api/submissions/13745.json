No way that I will EVER ask her to take care of him. The only thing I told him, is that he can always ask her questions or advice. It's our job as a parent to teach them and help them become the best adult they can. Not to burden a child with his sibling for the rest of their life.

People with it hold down jobs, wash their own clothes and dishes, make their own food, socialize, date, get married, have kids and do all of the things considered a \"normal life\".
