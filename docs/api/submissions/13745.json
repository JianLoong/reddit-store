Of course you need to say it.

He needs to learn to cope, or get a proper diagnosis and treatment, and if it's actually bad enough he might need a part time carer. That's something that needs dealing with before you mom passes. That could be decades from now or she could get in an accident next week.", "NTA it's good for her to know beforehand so she can make appropriate plans. But be prepared that she won't plan and that too will be dumped in your lap to deal with.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, it is important that your mother understand this so she can start preparing your brother for arrangements other than living with you two, possibly a group home, etc.", "NTA. She\u2019s enabling him. From what you\u2019ve written, he seems perfectly capable of living on his own. Also, he\u2019s not your responsibility.", "Nta.  I'm sorry this has to be hard.", "Sorry to say but your mum is enabling him to blame his autism for an excuse for things he don\u2019t want to do. That needs to be nipped in bud ASAP, \n\nbut NTA , it\u2019s good to let her know before she does pass so she can plan someone else to care for him. Tbh it\u2019s got to be hard for you . Take care x", "NTA. My son is also autistic, what used to be called Asperger before. For example, he is pretty social, but when in a group of more then 4, he misses some social clues. We talk, teach him (once you explain something once or twice, always with using logic, he is able to recognize the situation and tries to act accordingly). He has a sister. No way that I will EVER ask her to take care of him. The only thing I told him, is that he can always ask her questions or advice. It's our job as a parent to teach them and help them become the best adult they can. Not to burden a child with his sibling for the rest of their life. It's our duty to find a solution for the disable child once we are gone, but putting it all on a sibling is definitively not a solution", "NTA. Your AH parents are completely favoring your brother. If there\u2019s a way to report your parents for being negligent, do so. You\u2019re autistic too.", "Totally NTA when a parent brings a child into this world you don't own them. Your life is your own, you deserve a chance at having a happy carefree life. If you choose not to include anyone for any reason that is your right.", "NTA.\n\nAutistic women have been masking since early age due to social/family expectations/obligations. Yes, we see the world different, and we need to just f*CK work with it, the world/society won't change for us. \n\nBeing the sister/friend/maid will burn you out, it's only a question of time.", "No, NTA, you have a right to pursue your own aspirations and goals, and while your brother will have needs, they are not your OBLIGATION. As far as  your concern about \"well you didn't need to say it\". YES  you do actually, because your mother needs to understand and come to terms with shes going to have to make other arrangements for your brother rather than expecting you to do it. In this case, not saying it would make you kinda AH. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBTW, I say this as someone who will be 38 this year, who also was in special education all through grade school, and misdiagnosed until actually a few months ago of being on the spectrum myself. It does sound like your mother is enabling him. People on the spectrum, well its a spectrum, there are people with Aspergers (I know they don't call it that anymore, but I think its still colloquial enough that most laypeople including myself, still understand the specific implications enough. People with it hold down jobs, wash their own clothes and dishes, make their own food, socialize, date, get married, have kids and do all of the things considered a \"normal life\". Yes, there are some difficulties and challenges, and they can be  unique to each person, but I'm sure you're right on the money about your brother weaponizing incompetence.", "NTA - you are not his parent and you need to look after yourself first. You never agreed to parentification and it sucks that your mother did this to you. How are you doing with moving out and finding your own place?", "NTA--and that would be true even if (a) you were neurotypical and (b) your brother were far more disabled than he appears to be from this account. You may want to speak about your mom with this again sometime when tempers are cooler, but it will be best for everyone involved if you are clear about your future non-involvement in your brother's upkeep. I hope both your brother and your mother are able to form better plans for the future that don't just boil down to you picking up where your mom is leaving off.", "No, NTA. Your mom needs to know you will not take him on, better early than later.
