Before we ever met she and her sister had been working on her being a surrogate for her sister and her sister's husband. Global things delayed that, we talked about her agreement before we got together and now she's pregnant for them. She is staying with them for now but she comes over to my place frequently to spend time with me when she's free. Its not so bad but either she raids my kitchen or she complains nothing looks good and wanted me to keep some of her for-sure cravings on hand. \n\nMy parents came to visit me and asked me if I wanted them to pick anything up for me on their way. They had to pass one of my favorite restaurants to get here so I said yes. They showed up, we visited with each other. I ate a little bit of what they brought me since I wasn't really hungry yet and put the rest in the fridge for dinner that night. My girlfriend wound up coming over for a bit after they left. She got hungry and wanted a snack, and came out with the container I put my leftovers in and goes \"Can I have some of this?\"\n\nI told her yes. She came back with a plate and she didn't take some of it, she took all of it and put all kinds of shit on it so we couldn't even share. I told her that I said she could have some and she just ate all of what I intended to have for dinner so I asked her to either send me money to pay for so I could go get some myself, or she could make the drive and get me another order. She didn't want to drive that far and she didn't think she should have to pay me anything. I told her she should because it'd just be nice of her to do since I get she gets cravings but it's not like she's pregnant with my kid or we live together. She left at that point, left half the food uneaten and I wouldn't eat it cause of what she put on it. A couple hours later my mother called. My gf text her about what happened. My mom gave me an earful about how I have no idea what its like for my gf right now and I need to be supportive and let things go.", "created_utc": 1670960686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zl4vlt/aita_for_asking_my_pregnant_girlfriend_to_pay_for/", "score": 7040, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even if she was pregnant with your kid.\n\nI get it, pregnancy is hard. I've been at the point where I'm always starving and only certain things sound good. But even then, I would never eat my partner's supper. I'd make arrangements to have more food on hand for myself (my partner always cooked while I've been pregnant, and always made plenty for both of us - even ordering food we made sure there was enough extra for me when I got hungry again, or got me snacks on his way home, but I'd never eat food he set aside for himself - that's just rude).", "If she doesn\u2019t live there and has known cravings, it\u2019s on her to keep snacks on hand. \n\nNTA", "NTA your gf is.

Nickeling and diming in a relationship just makes it all transactional. You could have just shared that was your dinner and it was from your favourite restaurant.

It\u2019d be a different story of you said \u201conly a little because that\u2019s my dinner\u201d, but you didn\u2019t do that. I could also see it differently if that was the only thing you had to eat and you asked her to give a few bucks to order takeout, but as it stands, YTA. Just count it as a loss for not clarifying. Also, that \u201cyou owe me\u201d kind of mentality feels real score keepy to me, which is not healthy it\u2019s not like she did it on purpose to piss you off, but yet you\u2019re holding enough of a grudge to post about it on Reddit. You\u2019re entitled to feel upset about it, but this reaction seems a bit much.\n\nEdit to clarify: How ambiguous some is depends on the context. For example \u201cCan I have some chips\u201d (normal size not family bag) and someone says yeah and hands you a chip bag they usually aren\u2019t going to expect you to eat half the chips then hand the the rest back unless they said \u201cokay, but only eat SOME\u201d.

I don\u2019t know how far along she is but she\u2019s got a lot going on.  Pregnancy hormones during pregnancy and for a long time (6 months?) afterwards are all messed up.\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle her eating your leftovers and expecting her to replace them even though she asked first and just neither of you were clear, this next year or so is not going to go well.\n\nDo some research on pregnancy hormones and how to be a supportive partner.

You should have let it go out of basic courtesy.\n\nEDIT: I see this is clearly unpopular, but why I stick to my answer is that she already started to eat the food for which they had his permission, it is only the toppings to it that made it unappealing to the OP. The addition of toppings to eat the permitted food is in grey area here. Also the gf did not finish the food, so what makes us assume that she wouldn't have left any for OP. \n\nAnyway, I think it is sad to be petty over food someone is eating unless you are actually starving to death.", "YTA.

A simple \"yes\" may have made her think she could eat all of it. \n\nIf her gobbling your groceries is a problem, it ought to have been addressed the first time, not after resentment builds up from repeated fridge-robbing. \n\nIf she's getting financial compensation for her surrogacy, she should be able to stock your fridge with stuff to nibble when her cravings hit. \n\nIt's not up to you to provide her extra food when you are 100% NOT a factor in this pregnancy.", "YTA, she politely asked and you agreed.

Your gf is literally changing her body to grow another. You can get over it and go pick it up yourself. You're an adult, she asked, you replied, she ate. \n\nAlso. The technicality of the 'have some of this' phrase is kinda petty too bro. That's like someone saying '1min' and taking 2 then being pissed they're taking forever.

A fight between partners stays between partners. Sure, I bitch to my friends, but I know for a fact, they do not alter their view of my partner and would never contact him about the fight.

That was your food that was bought especially for you.

Sure, you can help her with cravings and appreciate hormones come with the territory so can cuddle her when she cries at a dog food commercial and forgive her if she is a little snappy, but she isn't baking your baby, and even if she was, she doesn't get to use up all the resources around her with abandon. \n\nCool off for 24 hours, and then talk to her.

She was hungry (because when you're pregnant you're always freaking hungry) and she was like \"oooh, this sounds good. I bet it would be better with pickle juice on it - oohh...is that pineapple? Yeah, let's put some of that on there\". Okay, probably not THAT kind of stuff, but really pregnant women are totally freaking crazy. I once sent my husband out for a tub of sour cream and onion dip. No chips. Just the dip and a spoon. He gagged the whole time I wolfed down the entire container. So, I get why she \"ruined\" it, but she shouldn't have ruined all of it.

But I will tell you that this is likely temporary. I know some people are saying she's using her pregnancy as an excuse and I get what they are saying, but I also know that when I was pregnant I was an insane human being that lost all sense of decorum. I ate sauerkraut straight-out of a can, if there was food around that \"sounded good\", you could forget it, it was gone, ownership be damned.\n\nEveryone has different pregnancy experiences. If I were you, I'd talk to her and tell her that you understand she's going through a lot but that you were kind of hurt that she didn't think about you and leave some for your meal.

Your girlfriend is doing an amazing and selfless thing for her sister, meaning she values her family so much that she\u2019s willing to carry a baby for her. Like you said, your GF is tired all the time. Does she make you come over and bring her things to make her feel better? (Side note: regardless of whose baby it is, the point of a relationship is to take care of each other). Nope; instead, she finds it in herself to come over and spend time with you. I\u2019m 100% sure it would be much easier for her to stay home and not visit you, using pregnancy as an excuse, and ask her sister and brother in law to bring her all the food she wants - I bet they would do anything for her.

Had the surgery to repair the problem, and I didn't know there could be that much pain; after all, I had had a c- section, no big deal; omg, it was insanely painful, and I was there for 10 days.
