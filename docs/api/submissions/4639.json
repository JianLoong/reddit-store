They had to pass one of my favorite restaurants to get here so I said yes. They showed up, we visited with each other.

She got hungry and wanted a snack, and came out with the container I put my leftovers in and goes \"Can I have some of this?\"\n\nI told her yes. She came back with a plate and she didn't take some of it, she took all of it and put all kinds of shit on it so we couldn't even share. I told her that I said she could have some and she just ate all of what I intended to have for dinner so I asked her to either send me money to pay for so I could go get some myself, or she could make the drive and get me another order. She didn't want to drive that far and she didn't think she should have to pay me anything. I told her she should because it'd just be nice of her to do since I get she gets cravings but it's not like she's pregnant with my kid or we live together. She left at that point, left half the food uneaten and I wouldn't eat it cause of what she put on it. A couple hours later my mother called. My gf text her about what happened.

Even if she was pregnant with your kid.\n\nI get it, pregnancy is hard. I've been at the point where I'm always starving and only certain things sound good. But even then, I would never eat my partner's supper. I'd make arrangements to have more food on hand for myself (my partner always cooked while I've been pregnant, and always made plenty for both of us - even ordering food we made sure there was enough extra for me when I got hungry again, or got me snacks on his way home, but I'd never eat food he set aside for himself - that's just rude).", "If she doesn\u2019t live there and has known cravings, it\u2019s on her to keep snacks on hand. \n\nNTA", "NTA your gf is.

Point of fact is that, pregnant or not, asking for \u201csome\u201d but taking all of anything is an AH move. Calling YOUR mom is petty af. And while she\u2019s right that you have no idea what being pregnant is like, I sincerely doubt anyone is giving any consideration to what being in your position is like either. \n\nNot gonna sound the Reddit alarm and demand a breakup, but keep in mind that your gf may choose to be a surrogate again for her sister or otherwise.", "NTA in my opinion. \n\nYou said she could have a little...she took all.

Nickeling and diming in a relationship just makes it all transactional. You could have just shared that was your dinner and it was from your favourite restaurant. Pregnant or not - if you asked for some and take the whole thing - you're an AH. Also she crying to OP's mom seems a bit childish as well.", "Dude. She\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s like common sense she\u2019s gonna eat all your food. She\u2019s growing a whole human.  You said a pregnant woman could have your food without telling her you wanted some for later and then got suprised/mad when it\u2019s all gone? It\u2019d be a different story of you said \u201conly a little because that\u2019s my dinner\u201d, but you didn\u2019t do that. I could also see it differently if that was the only thing you had to eat and you asked her to give a few bucks to order takeout, but as it stands, YTA. Just count it as a loss for not clarifying. Also, that \u201cyou owe me\u201d kind of mentality feels real score keepy to me, which is not healthy it\u2019s not like she did it on purpose to piss you off, but yet you\u2019re holding enough of a grudge to post about it on Reddit. You\u2019re entitled to feel upset about it, but this reaction seems a bit much.\n\nEdit to clarify: How ambiguous some is depends on the context. For example \u201cCan I have some chips\u201d (normal size not family bag) and someone says yeah and hands you a chip bag they usually aren\u2019t going to expect you to eat half the chips then hand the the rest back unless they said \u201cokay, but only eat SOME\u201d. Based on how the post is worded, I interpreted it as he just kinda mirroring her words instead of emphasizing. If he empathized the word some like in my example, then that\u2019s a different story. I hope that makes sense", "Ummm soft YTA.  Doesn\u2019t sound like you really understand what you\u2019ve gotten yourself into here.

I don\u2019t know how far along she is but she\u2019s got a lot going on.  Pregnancy hormones during pregnancy and for a long time (6 months?) afterwards are all messed up.\n\nIf you can\u2019t handle her eating your leftovers and expecting her to replace them even though she asked first and just neither of you were clear, this next year or so is not going to go well.\n\nDo some research on pregnancy hormones and how to be a supportive partner.

You should have let it go out of basic courtesy.\n\nEDIT: I see this is clearly unpopular, but why I stick to my answer is that she already started to eat the food for which they had his permission, it is only the toppings to it that made it unappealing to the OP. The addition of toppings to eat the permitted food is in grey area here. Also the gf did not finish the food, so what makes us assume that she wouldn't have left any for OP. \n\nAnyway, I think it is sad to be petty over food someone is eating unless you are actually starving to death.", "YTA. You need to end the relationship, you\u2019ve reduced it to monetary transactions.

A simple \"yes\" may have made her think she could eat all of it. \n\nIf her gobbling your groceries is a problem, it ought to have been addressed the first time, not after resentment builds up from repeated fridge-robbing. \n\nIf she's getting financial compensation for her surrogacy, she should be able to stock your fridge with stuff to nibble when her cravings hit. \n\nIt's not up to you to provide her extra food when you are 100% NOT a factor in this pregnancy.", "YTA, she politely asked and you agreed.

Your gf is literally changing her body to grow another. You can get over it and go pick it up yourself. You're an adult, she asked, you replied, she ate. \n\nAlso. The technicality of the 'have some of this' phrase is kinda petty too bro. That's like someone saying '1min' and taking 2 then being pissed they're taking forever.

He's obvi upset at feeding her based on all the info he provided.", "Ok sure good luck to you if you ever have to deal with it.", "Oh the OP has every right to be mad and I just don\u2019t find irate responses appropriate.  I do them as well, but I don\u2019t find they make for a happy healthy relationship, especially if it\u2019s in the middle of a pregnancy where her control of emotions is far more unstable than your own.  So I do consider giving into your anger with irate communication to be an AH response even outside the pregnancy scenario.   It\u2019s something I have been giving a great deal of study and practice lately, more effective communication to build healthy relationships.", "No, I am a man giving another man advice on how to treat a pregnant woman. Apparent previously pregnant women are weighing in on that advice.  Are you womansplaining how other men should give each other advice?", " Hormones do not excuse selfishness, and being pregnant doesn't excuse you from making things right when you mess up. In this case, the GF needs to apologize and replace or pay for the food.\n\nAnd before you ask, I've been pregnant a few times, and I know pregnancy hormones *very* well.", "Thanks, and goodluck finding a woman who would love to be treated like a child.", "They actually kind of do", "The metaphor means handle carefully, not treat them like a child.  I could say careful with the ticking bomb, doesn\u2019t mean you treat them as an inanimate object with a timer\u2026..  You are just here to argue that\u2019s fine, agree to disagree.\n\nI already have kids.", "So sad, so very sad that you believe that. I am so scared for my kids' futures with idiots running around thinking they can do whatever they want because of hormones.", "lol \ud83d\ude02"]}
