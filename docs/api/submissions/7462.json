My aunt & uncle were the kind of parents who would force Frank\u2019s sisters to wait on him & do all the household chores since Frank was the only son. Now Frank expects this kind of special treatment from everyone. He sees people not catering to him as rude & can\u2019t seem to fathom why he isn\u2019t the center of everyone\u2019s world.

But they\u2019re already struggling financially to fund Frank\u2019s lifestyle & they know they can\u2019t take a second dependent on top of him. They reached out to me asking for a \u201csmall loan\u201d (Frank\u2019s sisters already told them hell no) since they\u2019re planning to invest some money in stocks & gain a steady enough source of income to support both Frank & a wife in a few years.\n\nI told my aunt and uncle no. They tried pleading with me since the amount they\u2019re asking is not a life-changing or even significant amount to me. I told them that the amount of money isn\u2019t the important thing to me nor the fact that I think the stock plan is a terrible idea. I\u2019m not going to have any part in enabling Frank. My aunt and uncle called me selfish & told me to think about Frank.\n\nI told them that they are the ones who have failed Frank. He\u2019s gotta grow up & learn that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him. Frank\u2019s 24, there\u2019s still time for him to learn how to take care of himself & become a functioning member of society. He needs to learn now since none of us are going to jump in & take care of Frank after they die.\n\nWhile several other family members agreed that my aunt & uncle needed to hear it, most of the other family members told me I was in the wrong. They agreed the stock plan was a bad idea but said my aunt & uncle asked for a loan, not for investment or parenting advice. They said how I\u2019ve never raised a kid myself & should \u201cstay in my lane\u201d instead of being rude to my aunt & uncle.

They made it \"your lane\" when they asked you for money.", "NTA.  Frank needs to learn to live like an adult.", "NTA.\n\nThey opened themselves up to that line of advice when they approached you for a loan to invest (!) in to support their incredibly spoiled son. I'm also grossed out by their plan to \"find\" him a foreign wife to take care of him. That honestly sounds like human trafficking and/or immigration fraud. (Just because women overseas sign up on sites to meet American/Western men doesn't mean people don't take advantage of their financial straits.)", "NTA. Frank does need to grow up and his parents need to stop enabling him, especially when it's beyond their own means of living.", "Jesus Christ I hope this story is fake. NTA, lose their number. Is his sister ok?", "NTA. Thank you for your community service. \nYour cousin is not your responsibility. He isn\u2019t even really theirs anymore! Keep your money and let them dig themselves a deeper hole.", "NTA. Not your problem to solve. And paying for a foreign bride to look after him is leaving a pretty nasty taste. Either hopefully it will be short-lived until she gets residency in own right. Or she'll get trapped for life serving every need of a spoilt person.", "NTA. Let me get this straight, they want you to lend them money so they can (*checks notes*) import a slave wife for their adult child who (*checks again*) can't support himself because he's got out outtie reproductive organs.\n\nWhy do you even talk to these misogynistic, sexist people?", "NTA. They don\u2019t really need a loan, they are just trying to figure out how to get Frank off their financial books. They can achieve that goal in a dozen other ways that don\u2019t involve your money.", "NTA\n\nEven looking at refusing a loan in complete isolation. It's your money, you're never owed to give anybody a loan. Anyone who thinks otherwise is full of themselves. \n\nSo to see the context surrounding it? Holy shit man, those parents are just enabling him. What you told them is dead on correct, they need to teach him to be independent and considerate of others, not to enable him.\n\nI will say, the fact his parents feel as if you owed them a loan does explain why Frank was raised to think the world revolves around him. It looks like the apple doesn't fall far away from the tree.", "NTA\nYou don't give somebody money to buy a sex slave for their misogynistic little boy.\nYou have never raised a kid? Who cares. Not having children is way (yet, dunno your plans) better than having a Frank.", "INFO: does Frank have a physical or mental disability?", "NTA. No is a complete sentence, and you don't have to give others your money, even if you have it.", "NTA. No explanation needed. Absolutely fuckin not.", "NTA. It\u2019s your money, that\u2019s all that really matters. If they didn\u2019t want your opinion, they shouldn\u2019t have asked for funds.", "NTA. I\u2019m already worried about his future \u201cforeign bride\u201d too. How dare them even think that alone is moral?!?  None of what they have done is. What they seem to constantly do/have done, is take it upon themselves to decide when someone is more worthy than others. \nYou\u2019re 100% in the right here. Not your circus, not your monkey. \nI hope you can teach your female cousins about proper boundaries as they haven\u2019t been raised with any and are unfortunately more susceptible to being abused by men like their parents and Frank. \nFrank seems like a parasite.", "NTA for the reasons you stated. You're right to not enable Frank, and if they have to go into debt to fund the latest Frank venture, then they shouldn't be doing it and you would be right to not enable them either. \n\nYou're right that the best thing right now is to help Frank help himself. Without leeching any more $$", "NTA family and money don\u2019t mix, simple as that.", "You should stay in your lane. And keep your money in your lane too. NTA.", "Hahaha no, not a penny.\n NTA", "Yes, you should stay in your lane. Your lane is family member, not banker. If you loan them money you will never see it again and the next time Frank needs money he will know who to shake down to get it. Definitely NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour family who are telling you elsewise can front up the loan money instead then, if they see no issues with a no questions asked loan", "NTA\n\nHell yeah, I'm gonna stay in my lane, and my money is going to stay over here with me.\n\nIf members of your family are so generous with someone else's money, surely they can take up a collection amongst themselves to fund these morons.\n\nIf their own children (daughters) told them to get wrecked, you don't even need to pause for a moment to wonder if it is -your- responsibility", "Ummm it\u2019s very much your business to know what they\u2019re going to do with the money I.e. how the heck are they planning on paying you back?? \n\nNTA - anyone who said you should stay in your lane should lend them the money  and not come for you. Enablers are the worst.", "Relatives are correct. Your aunt and uncle didn't ask you for parenting advice and you should stay in your lane.
