I want to check into a hotel for 3 days.\n\nI (F50) have been with \"Sam\" (M52) for almost 4 years, married for almost 2 years. We flew his family (two adult kids, their signif others, and Sam's mother) to visit us in CA for the holidays. With us & two young-adult kids that still live in the house plus one of THEIR significant others, we have had 10 people staying in our house since Dec 19, with the visitors leaving on Jan 1st. No complaints about that - it's a 5 bedroom/4.5 bath home, plenty of room for everyone, and I was happy & excited for everyone to be here.\n\nHowever, my MIL is making me miserable, and hubby either makes excuses for her or refuses to acknowledge it altogether. I will not tolerate it any longer so I want made a hotel reservation for 28th, 28th, and 30th. Here is a **small** sampling of the issues:\n\nWe set up for MIL to have the downstairs guest suite - everyone else in upstairs bedrooms & bathrooms. She's older, has bad knees, had hip replacement not too long ago... it just made sense. She demanded to be in the room right next to ours so she could \"sleep as close to her baby as possible\" but wanted the downstairs bed to be moved up to that room. After a 5.5 hour flight that arrived in CA at 11:15PM we were moving bedroom furniture up and down stairs until 1:30AM, and we had to work the next morning.  \n\\-------\n\nMIL: Jeez - Sam\"s gonna need to take out a second mortgage to pay the water bill for your long showers!  \nMe: Nah - I pay all the utilities! (delivered with a smile)  \nMIL: Yeah, with HIS money! (Snidely)  \nMe: No, with the money I make from my job. I pay utilities, he pays the mortgage.   \nMIL: \\*scoffs\\* I can't imagine you make enough to pay for McDonald's cheeseburger, never mind a utility bill.  \nThis was said in front of a handful of our regular social group. I was so embarrassed. Sam heard the exchange, and didn't say anything. When I mentioned it to him later, he said, \"She probably didn't mean anything by that.\" She knows our financial arrangement, is reminded repeatedly, and while hubby does make significantly more than I do, I make pretty damn good money.   \n\\-------\n\nI made ravioli from scratch - hand-rolled pasta, etc. - for dinner the other night - a HUGE feat for 10 people, took hours as I am fairly new to the fresh pasta game. MIL said she only wanted 3 or 4 ravioli, so I put 4 in her bowl. Once plates were filled, there was one extra ravioli, so I just tossed it into a bowl, It happened to be MIL's bowl; when she saw there were 5 in her bowl, she pushed the bowl away, crossed her arms over her chest and pouted, refusing to eat. Sam said he didn't notice any of that, even though he made multiple attempts to appease her, including volunteering me to make her sometihng else for dinner.  \n\\------\n\nAdditional antics and final straw in comments...", "created_utc": 1703804944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t7hdh/aita_for_booking_a_hotel_room_after_mil_has_been/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stay out on legit errands as much as you can. But sleep at home, and see the rest of your family. When they all leave on 1/1, have a very serious talk with your husband about all of it. And one non-negotiable - she is not ever coming to your home again. You can visit in a neutral place or her place, where you can control if you leave or not. But never again in your home. She was incredibly disrespectful and provocative to you. Hang in there, OP, and stand your ground. Without a good ally in your husband, I get that it\u2019s hard.
