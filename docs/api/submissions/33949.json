I want to check into a hotel for 3 days.\n\nI (F50) have been with \"Sam\" (M52) for almost 4 years, married for almost 2 years. We flew his family (two adult kids, their signif others, and Sam's mother) to visit us in CA for the holidays. With us & two young-adult kids that still live in the house plus one of THEIR significant others, we have had 10 people staying in our house since Dec 19, with the visitors leaving on Jan 1st. No complaints about that - it's a 5 bedroom/4.5 bath home, plenty of room for everyone, and I was happy & excited for everyone to be here.\n\nHowever, my MIL is making me miserable, and hubby either makes excuses for her or refuses to acknowledge it altogether. I will not tolerate it any longer so I want made a hotel reservation for 28th, 28th, and 30th. Here is a **small** sampling of the issues:\n\nWe set up for MIL to have the downstairs guest suite - everyone else in upstairs bedrooms & bathrooms. She's older, has bad knees, had hip replacement not too long ago... it just made sense. She demanded to be in the room right next to ours so she could \"sleep as close to her baby as possible\" but wanted the downstairs bed to be moved up to that room. After a 5.5 hour flight that arrived in CA at 11:15PM we were moving bedroom furniture up and down stairs until 1:30AM, and we had to work the next morning.  \n\\-------\n\nMIL: Jeez - Sam\"s gonna need to take out a second mortgage to pay the water bill for your long showers!  \nMe: Nah - I pay all the utilities! (delivered with a smile)  \nMIL: Yeah, with HIS money! (Snidely)  \nMe: No, with the money I make from my job. I pay utilities, he pays the mortgage.   \nMIL: \\*scoffs\\* I can't imagine you make enough to pay for McDonald's cheeseburger, never mind a utility bill.  \nThis was said in front of a handful of our regular social group. I was so embarrassed. Sam heard the exchange, and didn't say anything. When I mentioned it to him later, he said, \"She probably didn't mean anything by that.\" She knows our financial arrangement, is reminded repeatedly, and while hubby does make significantly more than I do, I make pretty damn good money.   \n\\-------\n\nI made ravioli from scratch - hand-rolled pasta, etc. - for dinner the other night - a HUGE feat for 10 people, took hours as I am fairly new to the fresh pasta game. MIL said she only wanted 3 or 4 ravioli, so I put 4 in her bowl. Once plates were filled, there was one extra ravioli, so I just tossed it into a bowl, It happened to be MIL's bowl; when she saw there were 5 in her bowl, she pushed the bowl away, crossed her arms over her chest and pouted, refusing to eat. Sam said he didn't notice any of that, even though he made multiple attempts to appease her, including volunteering me to make her sometihng else for dinner.  \n\\------\n\nAdditional antics and final straw in comments...", "created_utc": 1703804944, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18t7hdh/aita_for_booking_a_hotel_room_after_mil_has_been/", "score": 447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And one non-negotiable - she is not ever coming to your home again. You can visit in a neutral place or her place, where you can control if you leave or not. But never again in your home.

The snowball rolls downhill getting much larger not smaller...\n\nIf you don't put your foot down now, your practically signing up got this for the rest of your life.. just worse each time around...", "Uh no. That is not your problem. That is what you need to do to keep the kitchen manageable. That they are not helping is insane.", "But she \\*is\\* a pervert. And Spam thinks it's his wife's job to out-bully his mother, like any alpha male...lol. NTA", "Hard truth to swallow.", "Well, that's a flashbulb to the face. I hate that thought, but I can't argue it.", "To be fair, I guess I need to grow a backbone. I've never wanted him to have to choose or decide who's #1. I never wanted it to be a competition, where there's a proverbial winner or loser. I guess I have enabled his behavior as much as he enables hers.  I never felt the need to be #1, but I absolutely will not tolerate being treated poorly.", "<~~reign her in~~ rein her in\n\nLike the reins on a horse's bridle. You tug on them and the horse slows or stops. Its been reined in. \n\n\"Reign\" means something to do with monarchy.", "I added that to the list of things this conversation will include. Better set expectations now to prevent issues later.", "The ex was a wreck by her own right - slept with the daughter's 16 year old boyfriend, racked up $200k in debt without Husband knowing, dared daughter to steal neighbors car, etc. But Husband has mentioned ex made similar complaints about MIL and that MIL didn't like ex. Go figure!", "This makes me want to disappear and start a new life in a different country.", "I'm sorry. It's an ongoing behavior and is unacceptable.", "Let him read all the comments on this thread.", "For sure. I married young. It took years to get through to my hubs. At one point, I had terrible headaches. I had tests and kept a diary. My doctor noticed a connection between headaches and MIL calls or visits ( we lived close then). He suggested a mantra when she got under my skin. I would go to another room and sit calmly and mutter (or think) \"screw you\" over and over.\n\nOddly, my husband saw the light when our bright little 3 year old asked him why grandma was so mean to mommy. He set boundaries. We have been married 42 years now.", "Its better to have a painful 15 minute conversation than a miserable rest of your life", "Ya know - you're right. It has been this way since we first got together. I always let it go when we went to visit her - it was her house, so I accepted it all and didn't say a word. I need to own my part in allowing this. Now I see that this is ongoing, no matter the setting.", "Because of that, this is unlikely to end well for OP. I hope she prepares for that likelihood", "Oof! A 3 year old saw the light!! God bless that child! And major congrats on 42 years! Incredibly admirable!", "Amen to that!"]}
