He has an older sister who had the same problem but who was prescribed Invisalign which fixed the problem. Naturally since we sent him to the same dentist she recommended the same treatment.\n\nBut he resisted the idea. He didn't want to be inconvenienced about eating and drinking for the six months that it would take to fix his teeth. His father and I tried to reason with him; his father told him \"Come on, dude; your sister did it. It's just six months out of your life that aren't even that bad and you'll have perfect teeth when it's done.\" But he kept resisting, so I said \"Do you ever want a girlfriend? Because you'll never get one if you don't fix your teeth.\"\n\nHis face crumpled at this and he left the room. I felt really bad at seeing the look on his face because I realized that I'd accidentally really hurt his feelings. His father followed him out saying \"Oh, come on, stop being so sensitive; your mom was just making a point\" but what I said apparently really hurt his feelings. He went to my mother and told her about it and she told me that what I said was \"really mean and unnecessary.\"\n\nI don't get it. Neither does my husband. I really didn't mean anything by it. I was just trying to motivate my son to put up with some mild inconvenience in order to fix his teeth. But my mom (his grandmother) seems to think that what I said to him was just way out of line.

Way to enhance any insecurities your son may have about his appearance. You are telling him that looks are the only thing that matters, which is simply not true", "Come on OP, you've really had to reach middle age before you learned  that when you insult someone they don't like it? \n\nYTA\n\nYou were mean *on purpose*. Trying to twist it to sound motivating doesn't negate that. Don't act all innocent now you're being called out.\n\nPlus you're showing him how shallow you are.\n\nPoor performance all round. Apologize to him.", "YTA, two ways.  \n\n\nFirst, his teeth, his decision.   \n\n\nSecond, you, his mother, just told him he was so ugly he'd never find anyone attracted to him unless he undergoes this cosmetic operation you want for him.  \n\n\nGo apologise. And mean it.", "YTA  \nYou just called your son ugly, but it's okay because you didn't mean to hurt him by calling him ugly. You meant to help him by calling him ugly. Of course. How silly for everyone not to understand this.", "YTA you hurt your son, shattered his confidence, and then tried to convince yourself his feelings are not with self reflection and a heartfelt apology from you. If his teeth are crooked and you want to encourage him explain how leaving them be puts him at a higher risk of cavities and other dental complications because crooked or unaligned teeth are harder to take care of. Feel free to tell him he can do Invisalign or braces because you don\u2019t want those complications to arise in the future\u2026 telling him he is unattractive and not worth a girls time? That\u2019s trying to shame him into doing what you want and that my friend is a really shitty way to show your kid that you care about him.", "I'd have gone softer, but I'm going YTA, and here's why.\n\nYou said it yourself, you felt bad when you saw how much you'd hurt him. Most people at that point would have stopped, checked themselves, and apologised. Maybe you did think about apologising at that point. But instead you chose to double down and decide that because you hadn't intended to hurt him, he shouldn't care that you did hurt him. \n\nHe may have several reasons that particular comment hurt him, and I won't try and speculate what they may be. The point is that you made your son feel bad, apparently unintentionally, but your refusal to apologise and instead turn to an internet forum to decide whether you're right or not rather than just sit down and talk with your teenage son points towards you being an AH.\n\nCommunication is one of the few free things in this world. It's a shame so many of us are shit at it.", "YTA.\n\nWhat do you mean \"accidentally\"? That wasn't an accidental statement, that was an unfair jab at your son for his teeth that came from YOUR genetics. By the way, my boyfriend has crooked teeth and a bit of an overbite. I love him to BITS. You go apologize to your son right now, and while you're at it, make his dad do so as well. You both ganged up on him and shamed him. Shame on you. Your mother is right, it was mean and unnecessary. There's nothing motivating about bullying your child. Lift him up instead of putting him down.", "YTA. You told your son he'll never get a girlfriend because... his teeth are slightly crooked? You definitely didn't hurt his feelings ''accidentally'', you meant to say something shitty so that he'd feel bad enough to correct a minor cosmetic issue. An extra YTA to the father, who decided to follow up with, oh don't be so seeeensitive, like it's on your son that he feels bad when you straight-up told him he'll die alone if he doesn't fix - again! - a minor, *cosmetic* issue.", "Mom: *deliberately cruel to son \u201cto make a point\u201d \n\nAlso Mom: \u201cDid I say something wrong?!\u201d \n\nAre you kidding me? YTA.", "YTA for calling your son ugly. You can't take it back either. You can apologize, and bonus points if you actually mean it.\n\nYour husband isn't much better. \"Stop being so sensitive\" is a cop out. You insulted him. He's hurt by it, but now that's his own fault because he's \"sensitive?\" That's not how it works.", "YTA and you're wrong. The way you describe his teeth, they don't even sound that bad and I've seen plenty of people with very bad teeth in relationships. Just because you're that shallow doesn't mean that all the other women on the planet are too.", "YTA. Of his teeth is \"slightly crooked\" he most likely doesn't need it, it's his choice if he ever want it done. And it definitely doesn't affect his finding a girlfriend, you crushing his self esteem does.", "YTA, as someone whose mom keeps telling me \"if you don't lose your weight, nobody will want to marry you\", it super hurts. 10 years later, I married my loving husband who could care less about my weight and it still hurts. I'll remember it til the day I die. You better apologise and hope your son will forgive and forget.\n\nEdit: Also as a dentist, I will always ask the patient what they think of their teeth and if they truly want the treatment or not. As they are the ones who has to go through it. I don't care what the parents say. I will educate the patient of the pros and cons and ask them to think really carefully.", "YTA. His teeth his choice. Come from a place with free dental care for under 18s, so braces are free when I was 12 I asked my parents if I could get braces (crooked top and bottom) they said yes because it\u2019s my choice. They didn\u2019t push me to do it because my parents were firm believers that a person has a right to decide what modifications they make to their bodies. \n\nGuess what even with braces I got boyfriends, i had  wacky coloured dyed hair, I still got boyfriends. When I had acne I still got boyfriends. Hopefully your son will find someone that isn\u2019t shallow like you", "Wow, just the headline alone makes YTA. What\u2019s with people thinking your teeth need to look perfect, perfect body, or perfect skin to get a boyfriend or girlfriend? If the other person is more concerned about looks than what you are actually like as a person then fuck them for being shallow.", "YTA - stop equating worth and looks, it's a bad message to put on your kids. If he's a good person that's all that matters.", "Very bad move.   He will remember that forever.   YTA.", "YTA. Your teenage son has barely crooked/misaligned teeth, which most of society who isn't in the public eye has, and you went right for his throat. Why are you both pressuring him to get work done that he doesn't seem to think he needs? Why do you want to 'fix' your son? And then telling him he'll be a failure in his love life because women only want him for his looks? Or men. I don't know. He could be gay/bi. Either way, you're a pretty shit parent. So is your husband. You don't belittle your kids and call them imperfect or call out little things and make them insecure about it. Don't be surprised when he winds up staying at your mom's more and going lc if not nc with you when he's old enough.\n\nYou guys are mean bullies to your son, if not to both kids. Gross.", "Yes. YTA and so was your husband. I get you're frustrated with the situation but it doesn't really matter if you don't get what you said hurt his feelings. His feelings were hurt and it was because of something you said. I still remember when my mom and dad would make fun of me for being afraid of violent thunderstorms. I'm pushing 40. They were like you, just saying things because they thought it would help, but words have impact and your kid's not going to forget the time his mother and father told him he was un-dateable because of his teeth. \n\nThe fact that you don't mention apologizing to him is also really worrying. How long has it been? Long enough for the kid to go talk to his grandma. You should apologize and try to talk to him like a person.", "YTA, You called your own child ugly essentially. Teeth ain\u2019t everything. You\u2019re judgemental as hell. \nThat wasn\u2019t even a good reason to straighten out your teeth, could\u2019ve come up with a better one instead of making your child feel like crap about their appearance, yknow, a part that YOU had in creating.", "Huge YTA. Wouldn't wonder if that fucks him up long-term. Parents really need to understand that this type of \"motivation\" causes damage even if kiddo follows the advice.", "YTA. There are a lot of people with far from perfect teeth who have wonderful, long relationships. A girlfriend should like him for himself and not his teeth.\nBut you're teaching him that the only important thing is how he looks, not who he is.\nIf its not a medical necessary thing to do and he hasn't been insecure about it yet than let him be and give him time to decide. Maybe he changes his opinion at some point and he can still do it then", "YTA. So is your husband. You told your son he is ugly and because of that he is unlovable. But guess what, you didn't just tell him that no girl will love him because he's ugly, that's not how a 17 year old's brain works. You told him you don't love him because he's ugly.\n\n\nCongratulations, this is one of those permanent damage kind of things. You can explain to him all you want what you meant, what you were trying to do, but your relationship will never be the same. He will always now question how you really feel about him. Whether any compliment is sincere, or a lie to try to smooth this event over. You have given him an insecurity that will be with him to one extent or another for the rest of his life.\n\n\nYou may think it was no big deal. That he was being sensitive and that he'll get over it. You underestimate the power parents have over how a child sees themself.", "YTA. You basically said \"you are so ugly that nobody will like you\" to your son just because his teeth are not perfectly aligned. There's always time to decide to fix the teeth. If there isn't a medical condition, you can just support him instead of making fun of the way he looks.\nWhat a way to give him even more insecurities! A person is valued for what they do and how they treat others, not how they teeth align...", "YTA.\n\nWhy don\u2019t you send him off for a spray tan and botox while you\u2019re at it? Make him as aesthetically perfect as possible for no medical reason whatsoever.", "YTA\n\nYou didn't hurt your son on accident, you hurt him on purpose so he'd do what you wanted and punish him for not doing it.", "YTA- this hurt me, and you\u2019re not even my mother.", "Freddie Mercury says fuck off with that shit.", "YTA\n\nAnd your husband is an even bigger one \n\nYou should get some botox for your crow's feet wrinkles and get a tummy tuck to deal with the flabby skin that results from pregnancy.  You have to do this to keep your husband happy.  Your husband needs hair plugs to keep you around.  He needs to work out so he doesn't look weak. \n\nDid that statement bother you? You did the same to him.", "YTA. That was an incredibly cruel thing to say. Had you immediately apologized, it would have been ok but you didn\u2019t. How awful to hear that from your own mother at such a sensitive age. It\u2019s not like he can only do the treatment during a narrow window. If he doesn\u2019t want to do it now, he can anytime in the future. He might just need a few weeks to get used to the idea. Badgering him and insulting him won\u2019t help.", "You just told your son he\u2019s too ugly to get a partner, I wonder why he\u2019s hurt", "YTA.  And so is your husband.  Your job as his parent is to love him no matter what.  It is definitely not to tell him that he is so hideous that the only thing people will see are his teeth, and he will never find love without them.  You pretty much told him he will live a life alone forever without this procedure, you realize that, right?  \n\nAnd then your husband calls him too sensitive because of your hurtful words.  God forbid he show emotion after his own mother calls him disgustingly ugly with not skills or talents that anyone could ever want.\n\nYou two need to own up to just how much you blew this one and never bring this up again.  You went way too far.", "Big time YTA\n\nI literally have these exact two problems. I have an overbite, slightly, and my bottom teeth are slightly crooked. I never had braces, nor did I want them, nor do I ever plan on getting them. I've had absolutely zero trouble dating in my life, and I've been happily married for 13 years. Pretty sad that you're so incredibly shallow that you project your ridiculous insecurities onto your teenage son and tell him that he'll basically die alone if he doesn't correct this super Minor physical imperfection.", "YTA, are you really so shallow that physical appearance to the level of slightly crooked teeth would stop you dating someone? Your husband had to feel real good hearing that his physical appearance was apparently his only attractive quality to you. Way to make your son feel his only romantic worth his appearance too.", "YTA.\n\nI get that you want to help him, but it's his choice whether he wants to fix his teeth or not. It's not like his teeth state cause him any other problem. It's just for coametic reasons, and since he doesn't want to go through the procedure, you shouldn't push him. So you're an AH just for that.\n\nYou're a bigger AH for what you said. From what you described, his teeth are not that bad. You're just making him insecure about them and essentially telling him he is ungly because of them, so ugly that none will ever find him attractive. Not everyone is as shallow as you and your husband.\n\nYou should apologize to your son and let him decide whether he wants the procedure or not. After all, he might just be refusing out of spite because you and your husband are pushing him so much about it.", "YTA", "YTA big time, you literally told your son that if he doesn\u2019t look perfect, nobody will like him, so that his personality doesn\u2019t matter. Wow, and you will wondee in a few years why he have low self esteem. Nobody cares about these things. You could\u2019ve told 1000 other things, but in the end is his decision. The way you chose to \u201cconvince\u201d him is beyond cruel and have 0 sense and you need to apologise to him ASAP.", "I don't even need to read the whole thing, title is enough. YTA.", "YTA\n\nThe comment was very unnecessary, so was your husbands. So damn uncalled for. He can get them fixed whenever if he feels like it.", "YTA\n\nYou were cruel to your son, and over what? Slightly crooked teeth?\n\nIf six months is all it takes, that will be true when he gets older and perhaps he\u2019ll change his mind. On his own. Without effectively being told he\u2019s unlovable by his parents.", "He's sad because you implied that he is ugly, not that he  will never get a gf. YTA", "YTA. You\u2019re teaching your children their attractiveness is all about physical perfection. It isn\u2019t. \nIt was cruel and unnecessary.", "YTA. Your comment was mean and unnecessary. You basically said his teeth make him so ugly no one would ever be interested in him. What a hurtful, horrible thing to hear from your own mother.\n\nIt's not like his teeth have to be fixed now or it will never happen. He doesn't want to do it now. Fine. It's always an option if he changes his mind. I don't see how this is such a big deal that you feel the need to bully him into doing it.", "YTA", "YTA, his teeth may not be perfect, but he is obviously fine with that. By going on about it, you are creating something for him to be insecure about, and being a teenager, he has enough insecurities as is like any other teen.", "YTA - You're trying to force cosmetic treatment on your child and then you show how shallow you are by saying he won't get a girlfriend because of it.\n\nYour son will grow up and find a woman who will love him for who he is and not what his teeth look like.\n\nEdit: his teeth can be changed at any time in his life but the mental and emotional damage you've caused your son may stay with him forever!.. You essentially called your son ugly!", "YTA you should find better ways to express good advice for the kid", "YTA. YTMA. M being massive. While teaching them the harsh realities of the world, you could take a palatable approach of doing this, and also build them up and support them in being their best selves.

Not everyone is that vain ..", "YTA, you claim that your son is too ugly to find a girlfriend and your husband/ his father denies him the right to have feelings. You are a real dream duo. \nThe dental treatment is not only associated with restrictions on eating/drinking, but also means pain.  And why didn't you have the misaligned teeth treated long ago?", "Let me translate what you just said to your son: \u201clet us fix you for something that isn\u2019t physically urgent by giving you mental pain that will definitely require longer time to fix later\u201d\n\nWay to trade a physical insignificant aspect for a long term image problem. Except one is just your personal selective preference being upset while the other is your son self-image being destroyed. \n\nGood parenting here. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou just told your own son he's too ugly to ever find a life partner and you're seriously asking if you're TA?\n\nYes and a crappy parent. You just crushed your own child's self esteem.\n\nMost parents solve these types of things when their kids are younger. Now he's 17 so he gets to choose if he does the treatment or not. Not you.\n\nSo stop trying to manipulate and shame your son, apologize sincerely and support him no matter what.\n\nOh, and he'll find someone. Someone who will love him no matter what.

Now, at 17 you can't force or bully him into doing this.", "YTA! Abso-fucking-lutely. Not everyone is so damn vain as to care about someone having an overbite. Also, humans aren't meant to have perfectly aligned teeth. It's just the way we have evolved.\n\nMore importantly, it's none of your damn business if your son \"fixes\" his teeth or not.

He didn't want to be inconvenienced about eating and drinking for the six months that it would take to fix his teeth. His father and I tried to reason with him; his father told him \"Come on, dude; your sister did it. It's just six months out of your life that aren't even that bad and you'll have perfect teeth when it's done.\" But he kept resisting, so I said \"Do you ever want a girlfriend? Because you'll never get one if you don't fix your teeth.\"\n\nAt this his face crumpled at this and he left the room. I felt really bad at seeing the look on his face because I realized that I'd accidentally really hurt his feelings. His father followed him out saying \"Oh, come on, stop being so sensitive; your mom was just making a point\" but what I said apparently really hurt his feelings. He went to my mother and told her about it and she told me that what I said was \"really mean and unnecessary.\" \n\nI don't get it. Neither does my husband. I really didn't mean anything by it.

Even if you apologize, and properly, this moment will not be forgotten. When he feels insecure about himself in the future, this is going to be one of the nails that really drives that negative self-talk in. \n\nAnd for the record, my husband has exceptionally shitty teeth.

YtA.", "YTA, I can't imagine what other vile shit you and your husband have \"accidentally\" said over the years. Like kids don't have enough self-image issues growing up and being in school without also having two mentally abusive parents. On top of also telling him he's being \"sensitive\" for then being hurt by those comments rather than just admitting it was out of line.\n\nPerhaps the dental treatment is for the best, but the idea that your only solution to convince him of the treatment was by essentially calling him ugly and unlovable to the point he'll never have a girlfriend.\n\nWho needs bullies when your parents bully you at home.", "Slaps forehead...

Poor kid", "YTA I have a cross bite and it was hard to get guys to leave me alone, don't shatter your child's confidence just because you wouldn't date someone with crooked teeth. This is entirely a you problem and there was no need to say something cruel to your child to get your way. Edited to add your husband is a cruel excuse for a father too you both owe him an apology and guess what... That will not undo the damage you two just did, he will remember this for the rest of his life.", "YTA\n\nHe's comfortable with his looks.  You decided that this was entirely unacceptable and hurt him. It's a shame there isn't an 'Invisalign' for malrupted emotions.", "YTA, you and your husband both suck.\n\nI can relate to your son a lot: my teeth were very slightly crooked, too. No one would have noticed unless they were specifically looking at my teeth for imperfections, which my parents frequently did. But most importantly, my teeth didn't bother me or hurt me. They eventually pressured me into just doing it to satisfy them.\n\nBut hey, at least my parents were decent enough not to tell me that my teeth made me so ugly that no one would ever love me then callously bitch at me to \"stop being so sensitive,\" so there's that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nStop bullying your son into letting you spend thousands of dollars to \"fix\" a part of his body that isn't a problem.

I think that's what's important.", "YTA and what in the fuck is wrong with you?\n\nMy spouse doesn't have perfect teeth. And I LOVE the crooked tooth in front to the point that I can't imagine him without it. What you said was horrible - maybe YOU'RE that superficial and shitty, but not everyone is.", "As a non American, I'd like to disagree. But from what I'm told and given the memes you make about the British I suspect that may not necessarily be the case in your culture.", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nYou just showed your son that all you care about is appearance. How superficial \n\nYou\u2019ve also probably given him a massive complex now too.", "YTA and really judgemental both of you, how about you get treatment for your crooked views because you want to be liked don't you? As long as he can eat, smile happily and be happy who gives a damn?", "YTA man. I had fucked up teeth. Never had an issue getting a partner. I have Invisalign now and it can be a pain to deal with when you aren\u2019t at home. You do need to change your eating habits completely to meet the criteria. And if his teeth are so crooked you think he won\u2019t get a girlfriend, it\u2019s going to be longer than 6 months. For me, it\u2019s looking to be about 2 years and I also had to get extractions done. I did it for my dental hygiene. And it\u2019s a pain, both to deal with and physically. What you said was very very cruel and also not true. That\u2019s something he isn\u2019t going to forget came from his mother.", "Jesus Christ.", "Point one. Your son has every right to have crooked teeth if he wants, they\u2019re his teeth. He can also straighten them at a later date, *if* he decides he wants to.\n\nPoint two. Any girlfriend worth having isn\u2019t going to mind his teeth. Are you particularly hoping for him to end up with a shallow airhead?\n\nPoint three. His parents are the last people on Earth who ought to be putting him down and bullying him.\n\nYTA and so\u2019s your husband.", "Probably going to get downvoted but whatever.\n\nNTA. Teenagers need to hear that certain life choices may have consequences. My son smells when he doesn\u2019t bathe. It\u2019s going to cause problems socially and when he gets a job. To get online he has to take a shower every other day. Having uneven teeth is cosmetic, but it\u2019s worth hearing that having a chance to fix a cosmetic issue- hopefully that you are paying for- will help. If we withhold the truth to protect kids feelings, show are we helping them.\n\nTeeth are a big deal. It\u2019s \u2018s stupid but how ppl\u2019s teeth look really effects their face.\n\nIf he says no, now just leave it.", "Wow. You just taught your child that his looks are more important than his worth.\n\nI have crooked teeth, and guess what? I\u2019ve been in relationships because people can (GASP) actually care about other people without focusing on trivial things like that.\n\nYTA. And from one mom to another? You suck.", "YTA.

If he isn\u2019t bothered by his teeth, why are you?", "You fucked up, and you will likely never be able to fix it.\n\nMy mom made comments about the gap between my teeth reminiscent of your comments, and I will never forget that. She probably won't even remember, but I will never forget. You tore down his self-confidence when you should be building him up.\n\nDo you believe what you said? If you do you need a serious reality check, because girls don't just not date guys because of a little issue with their teeth.\n\nIf you don't, you just tore down your son to make a point that you don't even believe is true.\n\nIf you want to try to make this a little better, apologize, mean it, and take your son out to do something special.

And your not the AH for insisting he do it.  Of course he doesn\u2019t want to do it because 17 yo boys are dumb.  Make him do it.  He will appreciate it later, even if he hates it now. \n\nBut yeah\u2026 leave the comments that hurt his feelings unsaid.", "YTA \n\nI told myself this for years, looks live I've bitten a live grenade.\n\nBeen with a woman out of my league for the last decade, getting married 2025", "43 year old woman bullies teen son over his appearance.\n\nIf he\u2019s not got a girlfriend (and wants one) it\u2019s probably because his confidence is shot by his rude as shit parents.\n\nIMO, 17 is old enough to make this kind of decision, so it\u2019s his call. Berating people is a terrible way to motivate them; even if it works in the short term, you\u2019re trashing your relationship over the longer term.\n\nAlso, I\u2019ve seen people with bad teeth in relationships, so you\u2019re wrong on points too.\n\nYTA", "YTA- if it's \"only 6 months\" then what's the rush? Wait till he's motivated by girls or whatever then do it. Braces need alot of commitment and compliance otherwise they can make teeth badly worse.
