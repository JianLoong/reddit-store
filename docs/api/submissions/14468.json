But I do agree, if you wanted to, you could complain about your coworker to management.", "Can I ask what country you are in?", "Hmmmm, technically this isn't true - the manager doesn't get the specifics, but if there is a policy in place around using the toilet (bathroom breaks should be contained to normal breaks, etc) and OP needs an accomodation to use the toilet more often, OP needs to disclose at least that much to the manager. Do I think it's okay that we treat employees in the US like toddlers? Absolutely not, but policies need to be upheld all the time if they are to be enforceable in the future. \n\nThe manager was keeping OP from having to take a drug test. That's what they were checking up on. Bathroom breaks that frequent are sometimes medical, sometimes a drug problem. The manager could have checked up on OP or they could have sent them for a drug test. So they checked in. It sucks and was uncomfortable for everyone, but that's what happened.", "I don't think it's legal in the US to restrict bathroom breaks. It's a human right to use the restroom. I worked on an assembly line and while others worked a bit faster if someone was off the line, we were able to go when needed.\n\nWe don't know that there's either a bathroom policy or a drug testing requirement if too many potty breaks. That seems suspect as it would often implicate women because of their cycle and would therefore be discrimination", "That's not what the person above you was saying at all. School is a place designed for learning, where an educator *who is being paid* is there to help instruct people. Out in the world, it is not the job of people to educate others, and that goes doubly for oppressed groups educating the oppressors. In the same way it is not the responsibility of BIPOC people to educate others on their culture for free, it is not up to women to educate men on our bodies for free. \n\nY'all men designed capitalism and get mad when it applies to you too. If you want to be educated, pay for it. It's not our job to endlessly give you free labor.", "what does capitalism have anything to do with reproductive health education? and the average adult is not going to educate themselves so your argument is not going to lead to any solutions, just more divide. yall so angry about a man not understanding womens health that you\u2019d rather attack than find a peaceful solution for future generations.", "Because we women have been expected to educate ourselves on your healthcare, and you have considered yourself the default, despite being a smaller percentage of the population. \n\nThe information is there.

Have the day you deserve.", "never said it had to be a woman who teaches boys about repro health. honestly id be fine of any health professional with the proper background and education.\n\nand information on the internet has been known to be incorrect depending on the source. see all the propaganda and false news/science on the web especially around covid. why should we be relying on some nutbag who thinks you can cure covid with tylenol because they said so online? wouldnt you want to rely on your doctor, nurse, or community health professional for the right info? I could type that women have two vagina\u2019s one for birthing and one for sex on wiki right now, and thatd be incorrect.

I\u2019ve literally never had a job where anyone noticed or cared how often I used the bathroom.", "[removed]", "I've worked in a few types of jobs. Retail, Call center, and Offices.\n\nLet me tell you the jobs that have had issues with bathroom breaks. Worst one, retail. Second worst, Call center, Absolutely no issues no matter how much you go so long as you do your work. Offices.\n\nPeople would argue retail isn't a real job, but its also one of the most dehumanizing job out there. You're at the whims of the customers, rarely full time, and \"If you have time to lean you have time to clean\" \n\nWorking in the office, you sit at your desk, do your work, go to the bathroom? Go for it. Go to the break room for a drink? go for it! Just do your work for the day and you're golden.\n\nWorking in a call center, worked for 2 different ones, one was \"you can go to the bathroom on your scheduled breaks\" which you got 2+lunch. And you were supposed to take them at the times they set. Which could mean the first break and lunch were in the first 3 hours. So you had to go the next 5 hours with only 1 break.\n\nThe second call center I worked for, you just set your status to bathroom and went. So long as you weren't on a call you go. There was never an issue with this call center and bathroom usage. If you did it excessively they might check in, but if you say the reason is medical there was no issue. \n\nJust my 2 cents from my work experience. The \"real jobs\" are the ones that care the least cause they treat you like a human being.", "I'm an engineer and I can go to the bathroom as much as I want.  People frequently duck out of meetings to run to the restroom or take a call.  As long as you're not gone for 20 minutes, it's fine.", "Nope you aren\u2019t being sheltered your manager is even really going above and beyond, you could complain to HR is you weren\u2019t allowed to go to the bathroom \n\nI get the same symptoms on my period my manager (male) is fine with me scheduling to be working from home the 3 days it\u2019s usually a real issue", "I was talking about general medical advice to show that OP didn't even do anything out of the ordinary, not that I am in a situation where a boss annoys me about toilet breaks.

If he tried you could take him to court for discrimination. You can't fucking hold your period in; isn't how it works. When you gotta go you gotta go.  You're definitely NTA. The dude complaining sounds like a piece of work. Personally I would have looked him dead in the eyes and told him that I think it's better customer service to not have blood running down my leg/staining my work pants; that ALWAYS shuts dudes up.
