You have a medical reason for going to the bathroom more often for a finite period of time. It shouldn't be impacting the team unless you don't tell anyone when you're going to the bathroom and leave the register unattended. As long as you buzz someone to the front I don't see why this would be a problem.\n\nAlso at \"real jobs\" people can go to the bathroom as much as they want and would be able to fight a case like this with HR more efficiently anyways.", "NTA \n\nYou're employed and getting paid. Of course it's a real job. Your co-worker obviously doesn't understand how menstruation works. He started something and you finished it. If he can't take snarky comments, he shouldn't dish them out to others.", "NTA. Your colleague is. And no, it is not an asshole move to go to the toilet often. It is an AH move for someone to be monitoring how often you have to pee though. And for your boss if he asked why you have to go so often.", "NTA. No explanation needed\u2026", "NTA, he needs to keep his mouth shut.", "NTA\n\nI doubt anyone's ever been fired for going to the toilet for legitimate reasons.\n\nWhat he said was uncalled for, your response was the sort of thing most people would think about an hour later and wish they'd said.  \n\nYou could have always gone into graphic detail about why you needed to have frequent toilet breaks and the consequences of not doing so.  He sounds like someone who needs to be educated on the inconvenience of periods.", "NTA  \nYou can't really control it and I'm sometimes the same if it's bad. Good comeback! Your coworker is the AH not you.", "NTA - You have no choice other than to pee in your pants when you have to go.", "Easy 1 2 3 on this one.\n\nEmployee handbook, find the policy on sexual harassment, present a written statement that your colleague was tracking your bathroom habits in an attempt to discriminate your job performance based on your gender, present to HR with a one liner at the bottom stating your recommendation is that this colleague at minimum receive sexual harassment training and change of dept.\n\nIf your company doesn't respond appropriately, any lawyer in your area will take this on pro Bono and get you emotional damage payment.\n\nYou sound like you work for a corporation, if large enough to have memberships, they're definitely large enough to know to avoid this blatant medical/sexual harassment.", "NTA. You should talk to HR though. An older male co worker chiding you about your body functions is not ok. Also, excellent comeback, he needed to be taken down a notch or three.", "NTA, but your coworker is, and your coworker got exactly what he deserved. Next time, speak up sooner.", "NTA- Your co worker is completely wrong, you won\u2019t be fired for going to the bathroom while on your period at other jobs.

My job is very real haha...Do you think I am being \"sheltered\" here by my manager?

The laws here are very pro employer.", "As someone who has had numerous \"real jobs\", and who needs the bathroom fairly frequently due to medical conditions, I have never had a manager, let alone a colleague, monitor my bathroom usage.\n\nI mean, if someone with no medical conditions was spending 20-30 minutes every hour or so in the bathroom, and it was noticeably affecting their performance, yeah I can imagine that being noticed. But one every 1.5 hours, presumably not in there for longer than it takes to actually pee or change a tampon/pad, absolutely not. If anything it is creepy how closely your colleague is watching a teenage coworker if they're that aware of your movements.", "Your manager was overstepping as toilet use can be due to medical issues which he's not entitled to know about.", "The internet exists. It\u2019s no woman\u2019s job to explain shit to any man. If they become grown men without realizing women have periods, that\u2019s completely on them.

It is not any grown woman\u2019s job to education men about periods. They absolutely can google about why women need the bathroom more when they\u2019re on their period. Or they can just shut their mouths and stop trying to police what women do", "without understanding that there is a difference, how is the man supposed to know to google anything? these are adults who went through 12+ years of schooling without being taught that there are major differences between men and women. I mean ffs these are men who think the female orgasm and the clitoris are a myth. Someone needs to educate them, maybe not your coworker, but at the very least our education system. You assume that ignorance is malicious when the core of the issue is a misunderstanding and lack of empathy."]}
