My uncle (38M) takes up the only spare room, therefore i sleep downstairs on the sofa. This arrangement was fine when I was under the impression i was staying there temporarily, but now it is permanent the family is agreeing i really need my own space. \n\nI feel like i should clarify first, staying at my dad's/another family member's home isn't an option for me, previously i was going between dad's and nan's, but I can't anymore.  Though my two brothers live with my mum, I am not allowed to go back there as advised my my counsillor, fis worker and social worker due to threats being made towards me, and the poor mental state being there has put me in, as well as other reasons i won't dive into.\n\nMy uncle has the largest room in the house, and he only stays there twice a night. He and his wife own their own place, but he sleeps round in his room at nan's to take a break from his 2 year old son in the week. He's not living at home because he's broke or anything, he makes six figures, but he just likes the time away.\n\nMy nan suggested splitting his room into two, as he only had a wardrobe, bed and tv in his room so dividing his space into 2 wouldn't cause the need for him to throw anything out. He kicked off and said that decreasing the size of his room takes away from the minimalistic design, and that it was unfair to \"throw him out\" to bring me in, especially when i could \"easily go live with (my) mum if (i) just sucked up to her\".\n\nI stepped in and said that he had an actual home to go to, where i didn't, and we didn't want to throw him out, we just wanted part of his room ( not even half btw, it was going to be like a 60/40 split ) so I didn't have to sleep downstairs in the winter. I also added that he had such a sizeable income, that if he REALLY needed that much time away from his family, then he could easily buy/rent his own place to stay. \n\nMy uncle started cursing at me before storming out. I've been getting angry calls from his wife, and facebook posts are being made about me, saying that i'm a leeching bitch who is \"pressuring a son to leave his mother's home\". He has come home since but it only led to my nan saying if he wanted all that space to himself he can start paying a portion of rent, which has led to more conflict between me and him.

Like, who needs a couple nights away from their child more than the Mom of the baby but he needs a \u201cbreak\u201d from being a parent? This is weird.
