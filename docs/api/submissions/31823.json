Helping someone should be out of want to do so, not out of self gratification at a later date. Also, that implies that the siblings would \"owe\" OP... kindness isn't a debt to be repaid.

It's great that you're doing well, but they're asking for a lot.  Some people think that because you're getting by and you have some extra resources that they're up for grabs.  They don't even ask about your plans for your moneybecause they don't care.\nNTA.  Them deciding to spring such a loaded request on you at a family dinner is a true AH move, especially given your history and thier lack of contribution to your success.", "It's you parents who care more about money than family - they offloaded raising the kids to you,. now they want to offload the college expenses to you. Funny how ass\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* always want to spend other people's money.", "Why would that have any bearing on this?", "the last part about the child being a girl so she can babysit for u\u2026 jeez", "A lot of parents see children as Utilities", "FWIW, I had a lovely Thanksgiving. The worst comment was that my 90 year old great uncle thought my 4yo son was a girl and that he needed a haircut. After a few minutes of talking to him he said \"It's really nice hair though. It's a shame to cut it...\"", "Reddit and AITA self-select for situations where Thanksgiving turned ugly. The \"we had a wonderful Thanksgiving\" posts are all on instagram and facebook.", "It's the dysfunctional families that get all the attention. Kinda like watching a train wreck.", "Even that I think is the parent's job. He didn't ask to become a parent, so why does he have to do all this research for his siblings?", "But why should he even offer a fixed amount?", "Just because others were made to watch their siblings doesn't make it right. \n\nAnd a point to note us that minding your siblings for an hour here or their is one thing, essentially raising them is very different", "That doesn't make any sense ,\ud83d\ude12\ud83d\ude12", "What greedy? The fact he did everything on his own with the help of his wife? His family acted like garbage?", "It's common here in our country where people do the deed like rabbits and gets pregnant with multiple kids like a lottery. The best kid will support the family.", "We don\u2019t know the parents\u2019 circumstances.  They might get have worked very hard in low-paying jobs and needed the daycare help from the older sibling. That\u2019s reality for millions.  However, they are pretty gutsy thinking they have a say in their son\u2019s finances.", "They can still get an education, they\u2019ll just have to take out loans like the rest of us.", "Nope my mom did that to my aunt and guess what? She acted like an entitled prick and gave up after she got pregnant.", "My older brother has done very well but he worked damned hard to be where he is now. Yes, he has a lot, but that doesn't entitle anyone to expect him to shoulder any and all entitled requests for funding.  These boys are the absolute responsibility of their parents.  It may come down to his parents using the famous line, \"but we're family\".  Please ignore any and all requests for funding your siblings' education.  You are  most  DEFINITELY NOT THE AH.  \ud83e\udd9c", "What about Christmas, Easter and Birthdays?", "lol. 90 years old. That\u2019s how they think.", "It's would be relevant if the parent gave all their savings to start up their first born son's business and as a results don't have the money to pay for the younger one's education. OP would be at least obligated to pay back the money he got.", "In the off chance that he is even considering giving assistance. It's an option he can consider", "Have to get rid of the for-profit education first.", "I didn't know that! Ok, so then I guess it depends on where OP is from and what their cultural practices sort of dictate.", "Agreed", "Are.... Are these the siblings????", "Ah right. Thanks for clarifying. And I\u2019m sorry for your friend, that\u2019s awful (and why you should have a separate account for each kid). I thought you meant if they paid for him, he should pay for his siblings. (Who sound significantly younger, so parents should have had time to plan)", "I don't think they really care about Easter and Birthdays, but Christmas is coming wait untill you see the drama\ud83d\ude2d", "Lots of issues then too", "The OP said they didn't go to college but managed to be in a better situation, their siblings could learn from them instead of being a dead weight lmao.", "I value my family as well big dog. Reddit mostly hates their family or feels they are completely separate from them and has not obligation to them. Certainly cultural components", "He literally wrote household income. You cant just take for granted that people write the wrong word. If he wrote household income thats probably what he means", "Being a naive fool is on you. They didn't get along but why would you waste EXTREMELY LIMITED resources expecting the siblings to help you in the end?", "Op is not a CPA/ea.  You can be a scrooge and still NTA.", "What are you a communist? Taking resources from the overworked one then he/she gets nothing?", "OP was upset with parents for making them babysit siblings lol unless it was edited, there's nothing said about the siblings attitudes or character. You're making pretty grand assumptions. Legit went to reread the post after seeing your comment. I see nothing of the sort... like at all. ??"]}
