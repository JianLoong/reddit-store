It's up to your parents and siblings to figure out how to find their college.  It's part of the college experience and helps with getting them into planning their finances.  Who knows maybe they'll get scholarships or grants.   I'd actually put together a packet on how to find financial aid and see what government assistance is available for your siblings.

Tertiary education is very expensive, would you have to pay for boarding, textbooks, stationery but most importantly are they going to pass their chosen degree? Are your siblings honestly smart and discipline enough to take the opportunity seriously and not waste the money away because oh my brother is loaded. \n\nFamily does not mean you have to drop and do everything for people and parents should've made a plan knowing they will be going to college or uni.", "NTA. Don't pay for college. Consider helping them out with a rent deposit or similar in the future. Weirdly I think they are more likely to be properly appriecative of that.

If not then don\u2019t.  It\u2019s inappropriate for your parents to even ask.  It\u2019s even more poor form for them to become aggravated about it.  You are damned if you do or if you don\u2019t.

My grandparents didn\u2019t have a spare dollar to send her to university. If not because of my uncles who paid for her diploma, she would not have been able to go to college and escape the cycle of poverty. \n\nSo while you\u2019re not obligated to help pay for your siblings education, it kinda sucks that you\u2019re not even willing to help out. Even when you make over a million bucks a year.", "NTA and May I suggest this? You don\u2019t specify how many siblings or what age or how they are doing in school currently or even if they want to go to college. My suggestion would be to let each of them figure it out on their own and if you chose to, pay off any outstanding loans they have committed to when the LAST ONE graduates so none of them assume their school will be paid for.

You are their child, not their on demand ATM. As soon as they chose to become parents, they took on responsibilities of childcare, including paying for education. Most sensible parents start putting aside money into a savings account and adding to it when their child is born, for things like undergrad education, possibly wedding and/or first home downpayments. This allows for a larger amount to be saved, spread out over nearly two decades to be less of a financial burden/hit than handing over a huge sum at once. They clearly didn't plan appropriately and hoped big sibling OP would be their financial fairy, sprinkling money over the situation.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your siblings and can afford to be without X amount for a certain time period, you could potentially offer to lend the money to your parents to cover the immediate costs, with a written payment plan for them to pay you back, but again you are not obligated to do this whatsoever...

Helping someone should be out of want to do so, not out of self gratification at a later date. Also, that implies that the siblings would \"owe\" OP... kindness isn't a debt to be repaid. It is nice and kind to repay a good deed, but it fosters resentment and also makes people think kindness is a debt commodity, rather than from the heart.", "dude, this is what family is.
