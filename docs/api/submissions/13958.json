Yes it\u2019s absolute trash that it\u2019s even \u201cnecessary\u201d to come out. Heteronormativity sucks and needs to change but it is still a fact in a lot of households and this person obviously felt the pressures of that.

Your aunt knew your parents better than you. You were suffering needlessly in her eyes. \n\nThe real ah is your mom. A good mom doesn't reveal her sources. A good mom protects her sources so she can keep getting the inside info. \n\nWhat mom should have done was begin to build your confidence in her ability to accept you.
