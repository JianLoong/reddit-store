I ended up opening up about my sexuality and telling her how scared I am to tell my parents. She said that she knows that my parents will accept me no matter who I am, but I asked her to keep this a secret because I couldn't be sure. She gave me a promise.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, my mom had a serious talk to me. She told me she found out about me being gay from my aunt and that she felt offended that I thought she might not accept me. And she did accept me, which I was thankful for.\n\nBut I snapped at my aunt for revealing my secret.

That is a *massive* breach of trust. \n\nThe end result does not justify her breaking confidence and spreading your sexuality like hot gossip. There was a reason you were nervous and she didn\u2019t take your feelings into consideration she just flapped her gums and acted like she knew what\u2019s best. That is an extremely immature, entitled and toxic attitude. Only *you* know when it\u2019s right for you to come out and to whom. That\u2019s a very personal thing and she took that from you. \n\nHer attitude of you being ungrateful is bizarre and honestly just her deflecting. She did something wrong and is now trying to pass the blame back to you. She\u2019s gaslighting you. That\u2019s not OK! Feel free to send her this comment. \n\nAlso, your mom handled it really poorly. Instead of coming to you with love and acceptance and trying to figure out what *she* has done to make you feel unsure of her affections and unsafe to talk to her about an important part of your identity, she made it about herself and tried to guilt trip you. Also unacceptable, and you can tell her I said so. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your coming out experience was less than ideal because of the actions of the self centred adults in your life BUT *congratulations on coming out*!!!
