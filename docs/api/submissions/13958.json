That is a *massive* breach of trust. \n\nThe end result does not justify her breaking confidence and spreading your sexuality like hot gossip. There was a reason you were nervous and she didn\u2019t take your feelings into consideration she just flapped her gums and acted like she knew what\u2019s best. That is an extremely immature, entitled and toxic attitude. Only *you* know when it\u2019s right for you to come out and to whom. That\u2019s a very personal thing and she took that from you. \n\nHer attitude of you being ungrateful is bizarre and honestly just her deflecting. She did something wrong and is now trying to pass the blame back to you. She\u2019s gaslighting you. That\u2019s not OK! Feel free to send her this comment. \n\nAlso, your mom handled it really poorly. Instead of coming to you with love and acceptance and trying to figure out what *she* has done to make you feel unsure of her affections and unsafe to talk to her about an important part of your identity, she made it about herself and tried to guilt trip you. Also unacceptable, and you can tell her I said so. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your coming out experience was less than ideal because of the actions of the self centred adults in your life BUT *congratulations on coming out*!!!

Why do they have to have some big emotional moment where they confess this big secret? Being gay is routine. It's natural and common. The only reason gays have to declare themselves is because normie straight religious assholes continue to ostracize and 'otherize' what has always been part of our lives.\n\nBut let's not lose sight of the real situation. Gays are forced to hide AND forced to publicly announce their private lives because straights demand it.", "Here\u2019s the thing, it\u2019s on the parents to be clear to their kid that they aren\u2019t homophobic. If my kid was worried to come out to me I would be so ashamed of myself for behaving in a way that would made them think I could be homophobic. I\u2019d bet OP\u2019s mom\u2019s reaction is coming from that embarrassment. \n\nIf OP thought their parents might be homophobic then it\u2019s because they have had some indication of it in the past. No one assumes that without merit. It could be a small comment(s) they made, or people/organizations they associate with, or politicians they\u2019ve supported in the past, but any good parent will be very explicit with their kid that they would be okay with them being queer. \n\nSource: my mom has a gay brother who she is very supportive of and STILL sat me down at 8 years old and again at 15 to make sure I was well aware that she would have no issue with me being gay. And good thing she did because when I came out to her I knew it would be fine so it was as casual as: mom-\u201cwhat are your plans this weekend\u201d me-I\u2019m going on a date with a cute girl!\u201d mom-\u201cohh okay\u2026. Nice! How\u2019d you meet her?\u201d\n\n*It\u2019s OP\u2019s parents fault that their behavior led OP to believe they could be homophobic. If anything they should\u2019ve apologized to OP for that.*", "NTA   \nAnd no they do not f\\*\\*\\*ing \"deserve\" to know anyone's sexuality unless the person is willing to share it with them...  \nWith how many young people get kicked out and abused by their own family because of something like that, how can u blame him for not being ready to come out to his parents even if they are okay with it.  \nFrom ur profile u seem to have a lot of negative biased opinions towards lgbtq so I hope one day u will be more tolerant and open minded.", "What a weird, wrong take.", "From the way she spoke to OP she would have used the same excuses had things gone poorly.\n\nShe is from the generations of \u201cMy intentions were good so nobody should criticize me!\u201d. OP is \u201cungrateful\u201d and should be thankful that the aunt graced her with her actions!\n\nShe didn\u2019t believe that OP had the personal autonomy to maintain a secret, since she \u201cknew better\u201d she took it to do what she *wanted*.\n\nOP, your takeaway from all of this is knowing now that your aunt is not someone you can trust.\n\nNTA.", "So why didn't they add any of that Inthe OP? If you've had experiences of you parents being homophobic that to me would be a major part of the story. Blaming the parents for the op accusing them of being homophobic is nonsense.."]}
