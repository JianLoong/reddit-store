Initially I was going to wear a nice dark blue dress that I like to wear out, but he asked me to wear a different white dress that I had shown him once as it matched his outfit (I\u2019ve never had a guy ask me this). The white dress in question was a gift from my late grandmother and was quite expensive, so I was reluctant but agreed and just asked that we didn\u2019t go anywhere after where I might spill something on it or otherwise mess it up (he mentioned clubbing after dinner which is why I said that, I didn\u2019t want to risk messing the dress up) and he said we could just go to dinner and  I could change out of it before doing anything else. Great!\n\nHowever, the evening took a turn for the worse when he accidentally spilled his red wine all over my dress. He had gotten an unexpected call and when he tried to quickly mute his ringer, his elbow hit his glass and it spilled all in the lap area of my dress before I could react. It was completely drenched and stained. He was apologetic at the time, and I tried to be cool about it, but inside, I was devastated, especially since I had mentioned specifically how I wanted to be careful wearing it.\n\nLater, I mentioned to him that the dress was very expensive and asked if he'd be willing to help with the cost of cleaning or replacing it. To get it professionally cleaned and the stain removed would cost $100, which I asked him to pay half of. To my surprise, he got quite defensive. He argued that it was an accident and that I was being unreasonable for expecting him to pay for something like that, and that it was my fault for wearing it out knowing that it could\u2019ve happened.\n\nI feel like it's a matter of principle. Yes, it was an accident, but the dress is ruined, and it was extremely sentimental to me not to mention a valuable dress. He thinks I'm being materialistic and making a big deal out of nothing. Now, I'm not sure how to feel about his reaction. AITA for expecting him to cover the cost?", "created_utc": 1703976510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18us4ng/aita_for_expecting_my_date_to_cover_the_cleaning/", "score": 1866, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who usually pays more often for stuff?\n- When you asked him to pay, you say he got \"defensive\".

Initially I was going to wear a nice dark blue dress that I like to wear out, but he asked me to wear a different white dress that I had shown him once as it matched his outfit (I\u2019ve never had a guy ask me this). The white dress in question was a gift from my late grandmother and was quite expensive, so I was reluctant but agreed and just asked that we didn\u2019t go anywhere after where I might spill something on it or otherwise mess it up (he mentioned clubbing after dinner which is why I said that, I didn\u2019t want to risk messing the dress up) and he said we could just go to dinner and  I could change out of it before doing anything else. Great!\n\nHowever, the evening took a turn for the worse when he accidentally spilled his red wine all over my dress. He had gotten an unexpected call and when he tried to quickly mute his ringer, his elbow hit his glass and it spilled all in the lap area of my dress before I could react. It was completely drenched and stained. He was apologetic at the time, and I tried to be cool about it, but inside, I was devastated, especially since I had mentioned specifically how I wanted to be careful wearing it.\n\nLater, I mentioned to him that the dress was very expensive and asked if he'd be willing to help with the cost of cleaning or replacing it. To get it professionally cleaned and the stain removed would cost $100, which I asked him to pay half of. To my surprise, he got quite defensive. He argued that it was an accident and that I was being unreasonable for expecting him to pay for something like that, and that it was my fault for wearing it out knowing that it could\u2019ve happened.\n\nI feel like it's a matter of principle. Yes, it was an accident, but the dress is ruined, and it was extremely sentimental to me not to mention a valuable dress. He thinks I'm being materialistic and making a big deal out of nothing. Now, I'm not sure how to feel about his reaction. AITA for expecting him to cover the cost?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If it does not fit his agenda, he thinks it's unreasonable.\n\nIf you get out now, you'll be getting out cheap.  Get out cheap.", "Cheap AF? Wish I lived in your world, being able to throw about cash like this unnecessarily. Actually, no, I wouldn't want to live in your world, I'd prefer the real world.", "This is the right answer!", "It's shocking he didn't offer to have it cleaned right away.

The bf always came across as very nice and self-effacing, but somehow the friend always managed to be the victim of accidents caused by the bf - from stained clothes to actual physical injury from tripping or spilled hot water. In the updates the OOP did talk to her friend privately who broke down because she was so glad she was not the one that thought she was being purposely targeted by the bf. \n\nNTA, he ruined a dress through his accident, so he should try his best to fix the situation. If he doesn\u2019t own up to it he is either inconsiderate, or worse. He could be subtly playing mental games with you where he wants to build up your self-esteem (dressing you up pretty *in his eyes*) only to be the one to take that away from you (\u2018accidentally\u2019 spilling wine on your dress mid-date where you have to suffer with the mishap the rest of the night.)", "- He got defensive, which either means it wasn\u2019t an accident or he\u2019s so emotionally immature he needs to go back in the dating pond with the rest of the tadpoles", "I hope OP sees this.

It reminds me of that story within the past couple years where a woman pointed out that her good friend\u2019s boyfriend is ONLY super clumsy around her friend - always spilling stuff on her when she is done up, in the middle of a party, and acting profusely apologetic - and the denouement was when OP got in front of him to take a mug of hot tea from him because she was scared that he would \u201caccidentally\u201d spill it on her.
