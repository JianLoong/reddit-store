Another student (F30ish) brought her 4 year old son to class. She brought a massive bag of toys for her son and he plays with them all class, making explosion and shooting noises at full volume. He also brought really crunchy snacks and eats them with his mouth completely wide open. This makes it impossible to concentrate. The mother never tells her kid to be quiet or anything.\n\nI do feel bad for her because she seems like an extremely busy single mom, and child care is expensive in America. But at the same time, so is college. I am paying thousands of dollars to attend this class, and the kid makes it impossible for me to concentrate. I have ADHD and already require accommodations. I don't think a toddler should be allowed in a college class, and I'm planning on asking the professor to do something. So AITA for that?\n\nEdit: I'm going to mention it to the professor. I'm totally fine with some comprise where she can bring her kid to class and distract him with a more quiet activity.\n\nClass has only met once so far, maybe childcare fell through for the first meeting.

Should next week's class go similar to this one, a polite email to your professor about the distractions and your accommodations would be appropriate, but you also need to be prepared that this may continue to some extent.

Basically, the following series of things are true and it is the job of the school and professor to reconcile them all, not the job of you or the other student, so neither you nor her need to feel any shame or hurt or anger, but you do need to accept that neither of you may be able to walk away from this with a 100% perfect learning environment:\n\nTo access the space, she needs child care related assistance.\n\nTo access the space you need a relatively low level of distracting noises, movements, sights, etc.\n\nToddlers are inherently a little attention-grabbing at least some of the time.\n\nBoth you and the other student are entitled to a supportive learning environment.\n\nThere isn't a great way to separate the two of you physically within the room.\n\nSome accommodations I can think of off the bat might be including the option for her to attend virtually at times when she is unable to get child care, providing you a notetaker who can take a second set of notes to ensure any distractions that damage your focus don't leave you without essential information for the course, they could see about getting you some directional sound blocking at the school's expense and assigned seating to maximize your ability to remove the child from your field of attention.\n\nBasically, there are DEFINITELY options here, and regardless of what they are, you don't have to take on the responsibility for implementing them. It's the college's job to support their students, and right now they're not doing enough. You can let the professor know that your not looking to infringe on a peer's learning accommodations, but your own are not compatible with the current solution and you need his help figuring out where to go next. Be clear with him that this is not a \"kids are annoying\" but a \"I have a diagnosed condition that means I cannot focus when random and excess sensory stimuli occur in the space\" issue.

You can\u2019t expect to be in a classroom (also every single class not just a one off) with someone who brings a 4 years that plays with loud toys.

Do you have accommodations from your college for your ADHD? For instance, my community college I go to have great accommodations for learning disabilities, you just have to have a legit doctor note with what issues you face and then meet with an advisor. If you do have it on record with the institution, it may work more in your favor that you\u2019re in an environment that\u2019s not productive learning. I had a single mom who had to bring her kid to a night class a couple times, and the professor was pretty relaxed and understanding (it was child development after all haha) but he would actually gently ask the kid to quiet down if he became too distracted, sadly the mom kind of did Jack shit, so they god the professor stepped in because it was hard to concentrate, even if I understood the necessity of why the kid was there! \n\nI have ADD that wasn\u2019t diagnosed until late adolescence, and my biggest issue is distracting/loud noises and they can overwhelm me.

Now, I bought my own equipment for work and got reimbursed by my insurance. \n\nI think there are similar equipment for non-hearing impaired folks. The teacher can record the lecture using Zoom, and the student can be in class and logged into Zoom, listening via headphones. At most, the instructor has to get a Zoom account, which I\u2019m sure they have through the university, and has to set up the meeting, but they can record the lectures to make them available to everyone, which could benefit the single mom, too, if she could get an accommodation to attend via the Zoom link remotely so she could watch her kid.\n\nETA: NTA.", "You could do this even with just a cellphone\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem like that big of a deal", "She's also paying and couldn't miss class.", "I don\u2019t think approaching your classmate kindly and asking for clarifying details or a favor is \u201ccreating conflict\u201d.

If, for example, she responds poorly and you have to get professor involved, she\u2019ll immediately blame you for complaining, even if other classmates feel the same way but haven\u2019t spoken up. It feels similar (but obviously not the same) as having neighbors that throw loud parties late at night - it can\u2019t be a secret that their behavior is disruptive or distracting, yet they continue to do so.
