Another student (F30ish) brought her 4 year old son to class. She brought a massive bag of toys for her son and he plays with them all class, making explosion and shooting noises at full volume. He also brought really crunchy snacks and eats them with his mouth completely wide open. This makes it impossible to concentrate. The mother never tells her kid to be quiet or anything.\n\nI do feel bad for her because she seems like an extremely busy single mom, and child care is expensive in America. But at the same time, so is college. I am paying thousands of dollars to attend this class, and the kid makes it impossible for me to concentrate. I have ADHD and already require accommodations. I don't think a toddler should be allowed in a college class, and I'm planning on asking the professor to do something. So AITA for that?\n\nEdit: I'm going to mention it to the professor. I'm totally fine with some comprise where she can bring her kid to class and distract him with a more quiet activity.\n\nClass has only met once so far, maybe childcare fell through for the first meeting. Shit happens.\n\nSome of you are saying I made it seem like a constant problem, that wasn't intentional. \"Brings\" can be used for a one time occurrence, but I get the confusion. \"Brought\" would've been better, so I edited it to that.\n\nIt's a 4 year university.

Basically, the following series of things are true and it is the job of the school and professor to reconcile them all, not the job of you or the other student, so neither you nor her need to feel any shame or hurt or anger, but you do need to accept that neither of you may be able to walk away from this with a 100% perfect learning environment:\n\nTo access the space, she needs child care related assistance.\n\nTo access the space you need a relatively low level of distracting noises, movements, sights, etc.\n\nToddlers are inherently a little attention-grabbing at least some of the time.\n\nBoth you and the other student are entitled to a supportive learning environment.\n\nThere isn't a great way to separate the two of you physically within the room.\n\nSome accommodations I can think of off the bat might be including the option for her to attend virtually at times when she is unable to get child care, providing you a notetaker who can take a second set of notes to ensure any distractions that damage your focus don't leave you without essential information for the course, they could see about getting you some directional sound blocking at the school's expense and assigned seating to maximize your ability to remove the child from your field of attention.\n\nBasically, there are DEFINITELY options here, and regardless of what they are, you don't have to take on the responsibility for implementing them.

Be clear with him that this is not a \"kids are annoying\" but a \"I have a diagnosed condition that means I cannot focus when random and excess sensory stimuli occur in the space\" issue.

He still would and he\u2019s 9 now (he has ADHD, combo type \u2014 inattentive and hyperactive).", "As I said, the playing sounds are unacceptable. The chewing sounds would seriously irritate me and would cause me to lose concentration, but I feel like that comes under the umbrella of normal human annoyances that one needs to deal with.", "Mine is really bad. I have tried a lot of therapy, and after decades it is somewhat better. It was so bad when I was little and my parents didn't believe me. When I was a teen my aunt found an article online about it and sent it to my parents. Once there was a name for it, they apologized and started trying to get me help. I can't thank my aunt enough. She was out of state and we only got to see her a couple times a year. Apparently my problem with noise (my worst one is crunchy type foods chips, etc) was even apparent to her.", "This should be higher.  No one is saying kids don't deserve to play or snack--but this isn't an appropriate venue.", "First classes are often mandatory. If you don't go, you get dropped from the course. That was the case at both universities I've attended. It was the only way they got me to attend a class where you mostly sit there reading the outline and college policies. I'd definitely wait until the second.", "There is no reason for a professor to allow this kind of behavior. If you haven't said anything yet, you should. If they don't do anything about it, you're moving it up the food chain.", "You are overthinking this. Why should the OP have to get doctor's notes and so on and expose himself to student disabilities like that?", "First day of class is often syllabus day anyway.", "Not a public space. Since the mother here was imposing on everyone else, she should have been hyper vigilant in controlling her kid and taking her kid out whenever disruptive. \n\nAlso, it's unlikely that a mother attending university can't afford a $20-$60 Kindle Fire to entertain her kid.", "No, they *dislike* inactive and bad parents. A good parent and good PERSON would have just stayed home and emailed the professor for slides and got notes. A good parent doesn't bring their child to a college class and let them scream and shout while playing with toys. A good parent, if they HAD to be there would have given them headphones and a electronic device to play with quietly", "College is not a public institution.", "Yeah I was with him til I read it literally happened once.

I mean, you do understand that childcare emergencies happen? \n\nI GUARANTEE you that the mom would much rather study in peace than also parent and entertain her child during a lecture.", "Mandatory attendance doesn't mean that you can't miss one class. it means that you can't miss multiple classes (maybe it's two for a three hour course since those are essentially double length classes). That being said I'd be surprised if a night class that has working parents in it has that strict of a policy", "Everyone knows that a certain % of grades are based on attendance but missing one class ain't gonna hurt you. \n\nThat doesn't change the fact that the kid should not be in class if the mom can't ensure that the kid is quiet. You're prioritizing the mom causing a disruption to the class over the rest of the classes' experience.", "Which is why i agreed with the NTA vote and said she should have brought quiet toys but my point still stands. Also people pointing out that this woman can wait to go to school or that they have kids so they'd never do this well good for you. She made a decision she could have been better at planning it but she messed us. Also this is a one time incident so why are we acting like it ruined ops chance at passing this class. Maybe just maybe this woman couldn't get help this one time, you don't know her all we have is a what information op gave us and honestly it's only coming from his point of view.", "Idk why everyone is missing the key fact that this isn't an everyday thing. This was ONE class. And pretty sure op mentioned it was the first session. It's possible the mom wasn't aware of the childcare services provided by the school. AND its possible someone cancelled on her last minute. This is just as hard for her. I'd give her a pass, I mean the professor did.", "I'm 100% with you, especially since in their edit OP says the university offers plenty of childcare options. Sorry if Mom's sitter fell through but that means she should be missing class instead of bringing her noisy kid to an hours-long college lecture. No way is everyone in that class not annoyed with her.", "I couldn't agree more.  Her issues are no ones but her own.  I understand having compassion for other people, but honestly, that stops when it affects others, imo.", "So many of the commenters seem to think that her having a child means that she can do no wrong and that clearly this was just a one time thing and that the school HAS to accommodate her, and that op is the asshole because she is a mother, and blah blah blah. \n\nIf you check their profiles almost all of them are active in childcare or parent subteddits. So it's clear where their biases lie. \n\nThey're having the misconception that op is mad that a woman *dared* to bring her kid to class. When thats not the case. Op is mad because the child was loud and disruptive the whole time and the mother did NOTHING to even attempt to quiet their kid down", "100% misleading. I was thinking this was a regularly occurring thing! \n\nIt\u2019s ONE TIME. Give the woman some grace. If it happens again, *then* bring it up.", "Yeah his post is misleading. I was thinking this was a regular thing\u2026 dude it\u2019s ONE day. Give the woman some grace.", "Idk why you\u2019re being downvoted for being absolutely correct. The world doesn\u2019t need to cater to parents even tho they may believe that to be true. Other people shouldn\u2019t have to have a bad class cause of one person, even if it is one time. It would be a different story if the child had been told to quiet down or had quieter activities", "I don't think it's childish to not approach a stranger and essentially critique their parenting in a classroom.  That's a classroom issue that should be handled by the professor.\n\nEmergencies do happen but if it is just one class she should have explained that to the teacher and stayed away. Instead, she decided that her attending class with a distracting kid was more important than her classmates.\n\nKids can be in classes but they can't be distractions. My mom used to take me to her classes because I'd sit there quietly but that was cleared with her professor and I wasn't loud", "I had a classmate in a community college class that brought her 5 year old a handful of times. Honestly, I usually forgot she was there. She sat on the floor in the back of the classroom and drew for the entire 2 hour class. Definitely one of the quietest kids I've met.\n\nBut yeah, a 4-year-old in a 3 hour class is a LOT. Most young kids are not going to be okay entertaining themselves quietly that long.", "I had a 3 year old in a class I was teaching that was perfectly fine and quiet. It was not an issue.\n\nBut the child in this post was an issue, and this professor did fail by not addressing it.", ">for the teacher not address it at the moment is just beyond.\n\nDude tought it was a transfer student or smth  I guess, don't know why a college proffesor would allow this.", "If they\u2019re quiet I don\u2019t understand what the big deal is. When I was in college some students used to bring their kids with them to class and it never bothered me. They\u2019re not being quiet in OPs case so that\u2019s a different story though.", "College is hard enough without a toddler making chaos in the room.  As a mom, I can not imagine how hard it would be for her to have one eye on the proff and the other on the kid.  \n\nIt is good to know that the university is helping with childcare options, so the mom does have somewhere to go.", "It depends on the kid. I was a quiet kid that could quietly do coloring books for hours. My mom took me to night classes, and even at her job she hid me under her desk instead of paying for childcare. The kid in OPs class was given loud toys and snacks so of course they're going to be loud. It says something that the kid was occupied for three hours without screaming or talking.", ">Might work for a bit, but my understanding is 4 year olds have a short attention span. TBH, very few of us have a 3-hour attention span, so I can only imagine.\n\nGive him an iPad and a set of headphones for the duration of class. You're right about the attention span. I'm a grown-ass adult (granted with ADHD) and three hours of doing the same thing would greatly strain my attention span too.", "So are you sure this wasn't a test?", "How long is your class?", "i never heard of gentrification\n\nwhat is it?", "100%", "I do agree with this part, loud toys...  not everyone has the capability to have a trusted caregiver take care of their child while they try to advance their life.", "Being a single parent doesn't mean you have the right to take a toddler everywhere. Unless a it's a genuine emergency, if you can't get childcare, you can't go.\n\nWhen it comes to college, if you have no childcare options, you take online classes. If you're signed up for in-person classes and your childcare bails one time, you miss the class. This was not the midterm or final exam, which means missing it was 100% viable.\n\nUnless all students agree when they pay that they might have to share their learning environment with toddlers, the school they paid has no right to interrupt the class they paid for by allowing that. No parent has the right to let their kid annoy others in an area others paid to be and don't have the option to just move along to another picnic table.\n\nWe won't get into how the mom consented to the limits parenthood would have on her free time because people will say you can't be sure incredibly rare scenarios (and completely incompatible with her behavior - cult members either don't attend college or aren't capable of the self-interest required to ignore how your selfish behavior affects others) that would mean she didn't consent to being a parent occurred.", "People are taking that into account. But people are also taking into account the fact that her child is disrupting the rest of the class (tbh this sounds like a seminar) with loud toys and snacks. This is a college campus- there are students who have this class session free who would happily take this kid for a few hours for food or money- I\u2019d have done it for a hazelnut steamed milk and a muffin from the library cafe when I was still in school (approx $8) (tbh still would)- kid and I can go grab a library study room, mom can go to class with cheap childcare in hand, mom\u2019s classmates can actually concentrate. I\u2019m sorry, but disrupting the class for three hours for everyone is not the answer.", "Guaranteed OP wasn't the only one distracted by the noise.

There may be many reasons for a professor to allow this kind of behavior.", "The disability office at my school was very nice and helpful. I had a private room for tests due to a seizure disorder.\n\n I think going to the disability office is an okay call, I don't think they will actually need paperwork since he's not asking for accommodations by asking for the child to be removed (the toddler isn't a student, it doesn't have the right to attend the class) but is simply asking for anonymity regarding addressing the problem.", "If it's a 3 hour class it might only be once a week so I doubt the instructor wasted 3 hours going over only the syllabus.", "But she made no intention to even quiet her child down, just ignored them. \n\nIt doesn't matter much if she wasn't happy having the kid there, she did nothing to make the situation better.", "Yeah I\u2019d say once is an understandable predicament.

I had a similar instance, only my class was an hour and the student in question never brought her child in. I liked how my professor handled it: He didn't say no or yes, he more told her that it couldn't be a regular occurrence.\n\nMy advice would be leaving out your ADHD accommodation and how much money you pay. Think about it: The professor made an accommodation for someone that was vastly different than yours. Whether you want to do this in email or face-to-face (before class or office hours) is up to you.\n\nFocus on that you realize things happen except that you found it very hard to concentrate on the material during the class and you can't sit through another session with a distraction like that. Chances are you are not the only person who is lodging a complaint. It's the way you bring it to your professor's attention that will make all the difference. Good luck and please update us! : )"]}
