May next time reject the gift at the point it is given to enforce your \"not in to him policy\"\n\nThat's not to say he a cheap mofo for asking for it back.", "ESH. He's definitely being unreasonable and you haven't really done anything wrong but why are you keeping the earrings? I get that they are yours now and he was wrong to assume they meant anything more but if you really are done with him why not just give them back and never see him again?", "NTA. You were very clear from the outset, but he chose to disregard what you said.\n\nIt looks like he was trying to buy your affection which rarely works (or lasts). A gift is a gift and should not be expected to be returned if it doesn't work out. However, if you want nothing to do with him, but he's persistent about getting them back and won't leave you alone. It may be better to send them back just to get him out of your life.", "YTA. Give it back, why accept it in the first place? You gave him attention and got stuff in return because you didn't set boundaries, give the ear rings back. You are petty and it's an ugly look.", "Ultimately, NTA. They were a gift given freely, therefore you get to keep them.\n\n**However**, it does seem like once he started giving gifts, you had to have known that he was not aligned with your wants. I'm genuinely curious as to why you'd accept a bunch of gifts from someone who repeatedly told you they liked you more than what you were willing to offer.", "He tried to sway your mind with gifts after you clearly stated you didn\u2019t want to be more than casual, OP. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily harm in accepting the gifts, but understand that no man in a casual relationship is going to give you expensive gifts without having expectations of\u2026 something. It\u2019s entirely on him for not communicating those expectations, which is why I\u2019ve decided the way I have. NTA.", "NTA. Even if this had been a case of you changing your mind about a relationship (in general or with him in particular), this was a gift. A gift you hadn't requested but one he chose to give you. If someone gives gifts with the sole intent of getting something in return... guess what, that's not a gift. That's a payment.", "NTA, you made it clear from the start, and **kept** telling him that you weren't interested. Not your fault that he has more money than sense and decided to try to buy your affection.  Keep the earrings, because for all you know, he's glommed on to some other girl who isn't interested.", "NTA & hopefully it will be a lesson to him to freaking listen to women.", "ESH! Why accept gifts from someone you have no intention of seeing apart from your hookups? Also, this wasn\u2019t the first gift, after a few tries you ought to have known what the intentions were and could have not accepted or returned some on your own. He\u2019s cheap and creepy, so let him have the one thing of his he wants back and be done with his creepy ass!", "NTA - and all other things aside, earrings are pretty personal. You cannot return them. They go THROUGH your earlobe. It's not something you should be giving to someone else. That's very icky!", "NTA because you can't ask for gifts back but why would you want to keep them anyway if you don't wamt more with him? That makes you come across as materialistic since you had no intention of anything more than a hookup", "NTA. You were honest from the beginning, and he can\u2019t demand gifts back just because he couldn\u2019t get you to change your mind.", "Girls all be saying it\u2019s totally cool\n\nGuys all be saying you suck\n\n\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nESH\n\nYou made it clear and so did nothing technically wrong, but he tried to buy his way passed your boundaries.\n\nBut read the room girl, and reinforce those boundaries with the odd hard NO.", "NTA", "NTA, and good move dumping him.\n\nYou did not lead him on. You did not ask for or expect gifts. He was trying to manipulate/guilt/buy you into a relationship. Now he's angry? Serious control issues.\n\nIf you haven't already, cut any ties and block him in any way he might be able to contact you.", "NTA\nA gift is a gift but you shouldn't have accepted them in the first place if you wanted nothing more from him than friendship or fwb. By accepting them you did lead him on", "NTA. A gift is a gift. He gave them to you so they\u2019re yours now. Sucks for him that his plan to buy your affection didn\u2019t work, but maybe next time he\u2019ll think twice before doing that.

NTA if you were clear about what you wanted from the start.", "ESH. \n\n\nHe is being very naive to think he can change your mind with gifts after you explicitly told him you didn't want more than casual. You are being very naive to accept gifts from a man who you know is feeling a higher level of investment than you are. At that point it doesn't matter what you told him if your actions aren't matching your words.

NOT to accept them.\n\nYou are in no way obligated \"technically\" in giving them back, but if you don't will he reappear in your life, harass you about them, in other words, would you be better serving yourself, if you did exert your independence . . . give the earrings back . . . and go buy yourself the same ones?", "NTA- \n\nYou said no to all his relationship demands... He kept giving you gifts..  you still said no. Gifts are not tokens you give to a person in exchange for a prize of affection. That's ew. Bob is super wrong about that and he's sketchy as all get out. \n\nBut let's be real... It's shady to accept expensive gifts from people you aren't close with and don't want to be close with (the only exceptions to this are sw related). Ya all were friends with benefits and so i get why you said yes to gifts.... But that said being shady isn't the same as being an AH especially when Bob was so insistent in the first place and ya all were FWBs.\n\nKeep the earrings, sure... But also maybe stop accepting presents from people you aren't close with.. cause strangers who bear presents are sketchy AF in their own right. And this was all the red flags. That's not on you. I'm not blaming you, but Bob was unhinged from the start.", "NTA. A gift is a gift and does not have to be returned.

Every gift except an engagement ring becomes the property of the recipient, no backsies. \n\nThe legal difference is that an engagement ring is the symbol of a promise (a gift with strings), and if that promise is invalidated, that gift needs to be returned.\n\nIn all other cases, gifts belong to the recipient 100% once accepted.\n\nIt's a hard lesson for some to learn, but I think if OP feels bad, she can return the other gifts.

Didn't mean he had to stay in that job or that he should have refused it because he wasn't romantically interested in his workplace..  \n\nKnow who else gets jewelry... People with ear piercings... People who like bracelets... Jewelery and the gift of it is not inherently romantic.
