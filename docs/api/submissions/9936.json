May next time reject the gift at the point it is given to enforce your \"not in to him\" policy.\n\nEdit: Another way to look at this. Show some integrity.\n\nThat's not to say he a cheap mofo for asking for it back.", "ESH. He's definitely being unreasonable and you haven't really done anything wrong but why are you keeping the earrings?

You were very clear from the outset, but he chose to disregard what you said.\n\nIt looks like he was trying to buy your affection which rarely works (or lasts). A gift is a gift and should not be expected to be returned if it doesn't work out. However, if you want nothing to do with him, but he's persistent about getting them back and won't leave you alone. It may be better to send them back just to get him out of your life.", "YTA. Give it back, why accept it in the first place? You gave him attention and got stuff in return because you didn't set boundaries, give the ear rings back. You are petty and it's an ugly look.", "Ultimately, NTA. They were a gift given freely, therefore you get to keep them.\n\n**However**, it does seem like once he started giving gifts, you had to have known that he was not aligned with your wants. I'm genuinely curious as to why you'd accept a bunch of gifts from someone who repeatedly told you they liked you more than what you were willing to offer.\n\nEdit to add: I think my question is getting lost in the sauce. OP says in her post \"*For the next few weeks he showered me in gifts, constantly, and also admitted that he was into me.*\". This is why I was asking why she let this go on for weeks when it sounds like he boundary stomped right away. \n\nI'm in no way \"victim blaming\", OP was clear with her boundary, he continued. I was simply asking why after even the first time he stated that he wasn't in the same place that this carried on. \n\nAs I said before, a gift is something people should be giving freely without expectation but the dude made his expectations known. OP didn't need to read his mind, he told her. It does seem like her accepting the gifts meant more to Bob than it did to her and OP seemingly knew this. When someone is giving you a gift and telling you how much they like you, you know that gift has strings attached.\n\nAgain, I stand firm in that OP is NTA, she was clear and the earrings were a gift. But that doesn't take away from the fact that I can see how Bob may have gotten himself confused.", "He tried to sway your mind with gifts after you clearly stated you didn\u2019t want to be more than casual, OP. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily harm in accepting the gifts, but understand that no man in a casual relationship is going to give you expensive gifts without having expectations of\u2026 something. It\u2019s entirely on him for not communicating those expectations, which is why I\u2019ve decided the way I have. NTA.", "NTA. Even if this had been a case of you changing your mind about a relationship (in general or with him in particular), this was a gift. A gift you hadn't requested but one he chose to give you. If someone gives gifts with the sole intent of getting something in return... guess what, that's not a gift. That's a payment.", "NTA, you made it clear from the start, and **kept** telling him that you weren't interested. Not your fault that he has more money than sense and decided to try to buy your affection.  Keep the earrings, because for all you know, he's glommed on to some other girl who isn't interested.", "NTA & hopefully it will be a lesson to him to freaking listen to women.", "ESH! Why accept gifts from someone you have no intention of seeing apart from your hookups? Also, this wasn\u2019t the first gift, after a few tries you ought to have known what the intentions were and could have not accepted or returned some on your own. He\u2019s cheap and creepy, so let him have the one thing of his he wants back and be done with his creepy ass!", "NTA - and all other things aside, earrings are pretty personal. You cannot return them. They go THROUGH your earlobe. It's not something you should be giving to someone else.

It's shady to accept expensive gifts from people you aren't close with and don't want to be close with (the only exceptions to this are sw related). Ya all were friends with benefits and so i get why you said yes to gifts.... But that said being shady isn't the same as being an AH especially when Bob was so insistent in the first place and ya all were FWBs.\n\nKeep the earrings, sure...

Expensive restaurants, taking me shopping, lots of concerts.

Giving you expensive gifts, no matter what he says, means he's really into you. That's the point where you should have broken it off, instead of going, well, he can buy me whatever he wants but it's still not going to get him anywhere. You'll say, \"I'm still not your girlfriend.\" He'll think, \"Yet, there you stand, wearing my jewelry like I'm your man. I'll have you in the end.\" There are men who are just really awkward with women, and have no idea how to get a woman to like them. They think casual hookups might parlay into something more meaningful if only they give expensive gifts, shower the woman with affection, or make demands. It never works. Though you were, indeed, clear up front that this was casual, your non spoken communication in accepting expensive jewelry gave him hope that you were changing your mind. I have a few guy friends who were adamant about not wanting a girlfriend. They'd hook up with a girl, put her in fwb status, and THEN shower them with gifts, fun vacations, dancing, until that girl who was totally fine hooking up got attached, and then weepy when he still didn't want to be her boyfriend. Two guys were like this. They would tell me, hey, I told her upfront I didn't want any relationship! Then I would say, well, then why did you treat all these ladies like girlfriends? Their actions very subtly led them on, and muddled boundaries. You didn't do anything wrong in accepting them, only that these kind of situations become more likely. This is one of the reasons why there used to be a long tradition in etiquette that a woman must not accept anything expensive from a man she does not want as a suitor. \n\nAlso, be careful having casual relationships with men you don't know well. There are so many crazy people out there. You never know when someone dangerous might cross your path. An angry confrontation might be just the beginning.   \n\n\nNo, you do not return gifts.

He\u2019s an adult too.", ">but it took weeks for OP to cut him off.\n\nWe are just arguing over where the \"proper\" timeframe/line is to cut him off.   \n\n\nAny time after he broke the boundaries is appropriate. Hours, days, weeks, months. Its kinda irrelevant.", "I think what you\u2019re saying is a totally different thing. What you\u2019re describing are one-off instances that are clearly not the other person\u2019s fault. \n\nIn this situation, it is not assuming that OP is to blame. But it is a little scummy to be accepting things from others that you have no plans to reciprocate and this does not solely apply to gifts or romantic relationships. OP set the boundaries of how she wanted to proceed and then proceeded to blur those lines herself by accepting gifts. If he weren\u2019t giving her such nice things but instead wanted her to meet his mother, would OP have taken that step? \n\nShe is not to blame for his behavior. But she also did not take any steps to mitigate it when she totally could have. It just benefited her not to.", "Well he shouldn\u2019t shower her with gifts and she should accept his gifts. They are both wrong.", "Sure but I think that\u2019s kinda implied on the ESH side.", "Oh well", "There\u2019s a bit of fear that women have when telling a man \u201cno\u201d. So there\u2019s that.", " Precisely. We're all about \"boundaries\" on this sub, but when someone actually sets a boundary and the other person chooses to act in a way that suits them, we're asking why OP didn't magically read the person's mind and know they weren't respecting that boundary.", "You're definitely NTA, they were a gift and as someone else said regifting earrings for pierced ears is a bit hmm. But you've described him as obsessive, so maybe this is one of the occasions where although you wouldn't be wrong to keep them the smart thing to do might be to give them back so he's got no reason to be in contact any more. Only you know if and how far he might escalate it.", "Besides she doesn't know if he had given them to someone before her anyway. Either way is gross \ud83e\udd22.", "\\> Fully agree with you that she shouldn\u2019t have to return them , however, and it is incredibly tacky the guy even asked.  \n\n\nI'm pretty sure your average Joe wouldn't know much about if the piercings would look unsanitary or not. I didn't. I learnt now.", "Gold, silver, platinum and metals properly plated with these metals are safe to clean with isopropyl alcohol.   \n If the earrings are made of unplated/worn plating on copper/tin/plastic, acrylic, pearls, or opals, they are not safe to clean with isopropyl.  However, all can be cleaned sufficiently with an ultrasonic cleaning machine using soapy water.    \n\n\nThe risk of transmitting a germ on the earrings simply isn't sufficient to justify not returning them on that basis alone.", "That's some really valuable information that you shared. I didn't know that there were earrings that can't be soaked in isopropyl alcohol.", "Yes, that's probably true.", "Of course. There's no other reason for her to keep the gift beyond it benefiting her.", "I've met both types of guys, those who gifted with no strings, and those that saw it as transactional access to my body. The latter definitely can be dangerous if not done with eyes wide open. OP says they took it from hook ups to fwb, which implies they got along well enough. So I don't think there was a problem with her accepting gifts, especially as she added gentle reminders that they were not exclusive so there were no mixed signals on her part. \n\nAs a rape survivor l feel its not fair to say she's playing with fire. It implies some kind of blame on victims. As women we are vulnerable against some, but we cannot live our lives in cotton wool. OP is obviously confident in how she conducts her sex life, and it doesn't seem right to judge her behaviour based on how someone else would react to it.", "but spoken communication (specifically spoken rejection/refusal) should absolutely matter more. saying \u201cyou giving me gifts does not change the fact that i dont want a relationship\u201d was his warning sign to stop the unspoken signals if he was *only* giving gifts in hopes of wooing her.", "they range from something cheap like stuffed animals to some dude that definitely wasn't rich buying me an iPad and a really nice weighted blanket within the first two weeks of knowing me. I agree that (especially for more expensive gifts) they absolutely can have meaning but I don't agree that that's automatically the case and should be assumed", "Gunna really spice up those Hallmark Christmas movies.", "This wasn\u2019t even friends. This was a hookup off an app.", "I don't disagree. He is responsible for his own feelings and whatnot, but OP is responsible for her own boundaries. \n\nAccepting gifts from someone *repeatedly* telling you that they are into you beyond what you deem appropriate for a FWB blurs lines. \n\nPart of communication is action, and your actions need to remain consistent with what you're vocalizing. This man was giving her a gift while stating that he is into her, the boundary is crossed. He has communicated and acted, OP is now responsible for either updating her boundaries to discuss gift giving within their relationship or shutting the whole thing down. \n\nThe dude is still a creep, don't get me wrong, but OP at best was naive here.", "Yes, being clear about her boundaries, like not accepting a gift that crosses said boundaries which therefore enforces and recommunicates said boundaries.", "It's not that weird for hookups to give gifts though.  You don't take your hookup home to your mother, but without being crass it's not unknown for a fwb to 'sweeten the pot'.", "stolen comment, report spam", "I agree with you that the risk of transmitting germs is not a reason not to return a gift. The reason not to return it is that it\u2019s a gift.\n\nYou\u2019re right about the metals. Alcohol can damage pearls, emeralds, opal, and turquoise, among others.\n\nI found this out the hard way as I used to soak my favorite pearl earrings, that my father got me in Japan, in isopropyl alcohol to clean them if I hadn\u2019t worn them in a while. I ended up ruining them after doing this enough times. I\u2019m still upset about that.", "Learn from my mistakes and don\u2019t ruin jewelry! Alcohol will damage pearls, opals, emeralds, turquoise, and I can\u2019t remember what else. You can rub the posts with a cotton ball soaked in isopropyl alcohol, being careful not to get it on vulnerable gems. However, many bacteria that are susceptible to alcohol have to be soaked in it for at least 20 minutes. \n\nI ruined pearl earrings my father bought for me while on a business trip in Japan. I would occasionally clean them by soaking them in alcohol, especially if it had been a while since I wore them and the posts looked dirty. I ended up spoiling the pearls.", "Yes but he showered her with gifts AND let OP know that he was into her. So even though she was verbally saying she was not on the same page, her actions were contradicting her words.", "You appear to mistakenly believe that I have stated she should return the gift. Perhaps read my comments again. You will find that i said no such thing. \nI said she should have \"rejected\" the gift.\nTry reading the info, understand it, and that way, you don't have to base your arguments on nonfactual hypertheticals.", "I don't believe that. \n\nI believe that if you believe she should have rejected it, returning it is the only logical solution. \n\nExactly what is she meant to do here?", "Well, people with good integrity would say something along the lines of \"no, I can not accept this gift because it blurs the boundaries of our relationship.\"\n\nIf you need this spelt out, then sadly, I can't help you here.\n\nWe obviously have vastly different standards to each other.", "How does it blur the boundaries? \n\nHow does it obfuscate her no? \n\nAre you saying if she accepts them...she's accepting a relationship?\n\nDespite clearly articulating otherwise? \n\nSo he's again...trying to buy her.\n\nRegardless, that's not what she or I asked - what does she do now?"]}
