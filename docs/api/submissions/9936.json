Giving you expensive gifts, no matter what he says, means he's really into you. That's the point where you should have broken it off, instead of going, well, he can buy me whatever he wants but it's still not going to get him anywhere. You'll say, \"I'm still not your girlfriend.\" He'll think, \"Yet, there you stand, wearing my jewelry like I'm your man. I'll have you in the end.\" There are men who are just really awkward with women, and have no idea how to get a woman to like them. They think casual hookups might parlay into something more meaningful if only they give expensive gifts, shower the woman with affection, or make demands. It never works. Though you were, indeed, clear up front that this was casual, your non spoken communication in accepting expensive jewelry gave him hope that you were changing your mind. I have a few guy friends who were adamant about not wanting a girlfriend. They'd hook up with a girl, put her in fwb status, and THEN shower them with gifts, fun vacations, dancing, until that girl who was totally fine hooking up got attached, and then weepy when he still didn't want to be her boyfriend. Two guys were like this. They would tell me, hey, I told her upfront I didn't want any relationship! Then I would say, well, then why did you treat all these ladies like girlfriends? Their actions very subtly led them on, and muddled boundaries. You didn't do anything wrong in accepting them, only that these kind of situations become more likely. This is one of the reasons why there used to be a long tradition in etiquette that a woman must not accept anything expensive from a man she does not want as a suitor. \n\nAlso, be careful having casual relationships with men you don't know well. There are so many crazy people out there. You never know when someone dangerous might cross your path. An angry confrontation might be just the beginning.   \n\n\nNo, you do not return gifts.

He lied initially and then very clearly made his intentions known that he liked her beyond what would be deemed appropriate for a FWB.\n\nI would not expect that a FWB or friend would be doing that and accepting gifts from someone who is making that display *can* come off as validation to the person trying to buy affection.\n\nOP does state that she reiterated that they were just FWB/Friends after each gift giving, but to allow it to go on for weeks does seem silly. It can send a mixed message. \n\nOP isn't in the wrong for holding steady, but I can see where the confusion set in and if OP wants a true FWB moving forward, she needs stricter boundaries.", ">She clearly communicated herself to him. \n\nThere is more to communication that just verbal.", "Can\u2019t upvote this enough!", "As a woman I agree with you.\n\nLatching onto gifts is also tacky and greedy in my opinion. \n\nI think they are both assholes.", "or get new hangers", "I would still be wildly offended if a man gifted me earrings he had already gifted to another woman. (I'd probably be offended by a bracelet, necklace, or ring, too!)\n\nOddly, I have no issue with estate jewelry (although most of those earrings were clip-ons and I have them adapted with new posts that only I have ever worn).", "He's not the one posting here asking for feedback.", "Pretty certain the deed was already done by then, and buying gifts for someone at the beginning of a relationship is normal. Accepting gifts when you have no intention of continuing the relationship shows a lack of integrity.", "I think the sentiment is that he\u2019s creepy because he was using gifts to forge a more serious relationship with OP.", "He\u2019s pushy beyond belief despite OP clearly stating that she doesn\u2019t want anything more and then trying to buy her affection using gifts and then acting like a jilted lover when he\u2019s not able to.", "100% I was generalising, and I said OP did nothing technically wrong, but this was so obviously going to blow up and by reading the room this whole scene could have been prevented.", "You're entitled to your opinion", "Well i agree with you somewhat", "She knew what he was doing when he gave her the gifts and still took it. That's on her.", "We found a gold digger lmao \ud83d\udc80", "Ewwww noooo", "Oh damn", "They can\u2019t be sterilized unless you have an autoclave. Of course, they weren\u2019t sterile when he bought them, so that\u2019s a moot point. \n\n(Sorry for the pedantry. Here, have a cookie as an offering of apology.) \ud83c\udf6a", "Ah yes, because women are birds and wolves.", "Meh, to me it is victim blaming. For example- you should have known not to go to that neighborhood, you shouldn't have worn that dress, she should have known she couldn't trust him, she should have known what the love bombing was, she should have known he was lying about his motivation I mean she was practically asking for it.... its a mode of manipulation that is still placed on women to police other actions. \n\nShe communicated. He agreed. He loved bombed (such a nice guy). She got uncomfortable and communicated again. He agreed again. She felt he was disingenuous and broke it off. He gets angry decides she owes him the stuff back.\n\nShe did her part.", "There\u2019s a bit of fear that women have when telling a man \u201cno\u201d. So there\u2019s that.", "Right, but you can't blame her for a lack of integrity without acknowledging that he has demonstrated no integrity. \n\nYou're writing about him as though he's a victim she swindled; in reality, she was honest and direct -  he was deceptive by refusing to accept that and trying to buy her affections. \n\nStop trying to buy women. \n\nStop trying to buy women and then calling us gold diggers for accepting the money when we don't want you. \n\nStop treating us and viewing us as objects and then getting mad when it doesn't go in your favorite.\n\n**He** made the relationship transactional, he doesn't get a refund because he **couldn't purchase her affections.**\n\nI understand we see this differently, buy as a woman, I'm getting really tired of men seeing relationships as *transactional,* but then getting offended when women *do the same.*", "Showering someone with gifts is not normal, particularly not expensive gifts, and particularly not someone who **told you several times it's casual.**\n\nFlowers at the beginning of the relationship is normal.\n\nDiamond earrings are not, especially when she already rejected his offer of a relationship. \n\nHe's attempting to buy sex and a relationship; having had sex doesn't mean he wasn't trying to buy more. \n\nHe doesn't get a refund, lol. You want to treat women like objects, don't get mad when we respond accordingly.\n\nYou say it's **\"normal at the beginning of a relationship.\"**\n\nBut you also acknowledge **this wasn't a *relationship* and she made that clear.**\n\nTrying to *buy her* afterwards is on him.", "Fair enough didn't see it like that.", "Yeah, that's not universally recognized by any means, but the nice earrings *are* a gift, and there's no basis to demand them back.\n\nI'm not going to comment on the relationship side as that wasn't the question, and we only really have one side of the story. Seems a bit unfair to assume she led him on when she's written that she never once agreed to a deeper relationship. Could he have gotten the wrong impression or wanted to win her over, probably...", "That's not correct. An engagement ring is a conditional gift in nearly every state.", "The term is a 'conditional gift'", "Why do we have the idea that he's delusional? Where did you get that?", "I mean, my wife makes more than I do and I\u2019ve always joked that she\u2019s my sugar mama, so you\u2019re not completely wrong", "To further your pedantry (lol)\u2026 Even if you don\u2019t personally have an auto clave, any piercing shop will clean your jewelry upon request (sometimes for a small fee), and almost all jewelers offer free steam cleanings which will sanitize them if not completely sterilize them. \n\nFully agree with you that she shouldn\u2019t have to return them , however, and it is incredibly tacky the guy even asked.", "OkeyDokey234, you're absolutely right. Plus, there are gems and settings that must not be soaked in isopropyl alcohol, so you can't even do that. \n\nSoap and water are not going to make used earrings sanitary.", "You're missing the point, which is when after the deed was already done he said \"He was in to her\". Ergo trying to start a deeper relationship. \n\nIt was exactly a relationship by definition. It just didn't go how he wanted. \n\nLike I said ESH. If you think she is somehow blameless and showed good intergity then you are very much mistaken imo. Good luck with that.", "NP bro \u270c\ud83c\udffb", "Could definitely see that. Tbr bro should\u2019ve left after the first night", "I was just responding to the comment above saying he's clearly delusional and that's not her problem.", "No surprise there", " I suggest he look up the definition of \"gift.\"\n \n That shit is yours.\n \n NTA.", "And she told him no.\n\nAnd if it was a **relationship**, which you claim it was, then **why is she supposed to give a gift back?**\n\nBy definition, that's not how a break up works. \n\nThe only moral argument you have is if she was deceiving him, which she wasn't. \n\nDo you expect all of your exes to give gifts back?", "Or it implies you're trying to buy a person.", "No, an engagement ring is entirely different from any other gift. That's the only \"gift\" that you are literally asked if you'll accept it or not, with strings plainly attached.", "No it wouldn't, because an engagement ring is a provisional gift until the marriage is completed, that does not apply to earrings.", "But he isn't, and claiming she's taking advantage of him based on something we made up seems a bit irresponsible.", "It's not a complete stranger though is it. It'd be more like a complete stranger wanting a relationship with you, and then giving you an iPhone.", "I do still think she's taking advantage of him, if she doesn't want anything with him she shouldn't be accepting the gifts.", "Then it doesn't matter then", "You missed the entire context of that conversation then. Literally just 2/3 comments up, dude.", "Why not?", "Because he's giving those gifts to try and win her round. He even told her he was into her. She should just tell him she's not into it at all without accepting expensive gifts once she realises how he feels.", "So...he's trying to buy her. \n\nBut she lacks integrity here?"]}
