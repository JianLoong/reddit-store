This included the earrings and some other jewellery. Afterwards, the gifts mostly consisted of him buying me expensive nights out, tickets to a show, and the game \u201cHades\u201d which I had been wanting for a while. Though I did not refuse the first wave of gifts, I did try refusing several of the other gifts, saying that it was too much for me, and that I couldn\u2019t return the favor. He insisted though, and I did end up caving and accepting most of it (Except the concert tickets, which I was too busy to attend)\nIf theres more information yall think I should give lmk, I wrote this on my phone in the bus so its not super detailed", "created_utc": 1676384895, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1126o7e/aita_for_not_giving_back_an_expensive_gift_i_was/", "score": 3911, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Show some integrity.\n\nThat's not to say he a cheap mofo for asking for it back.", "ESH. He's definitely being unreasonable and you haven't really done anything wrong but why are you keeping the earrings?

You were very clear from the outset, but he chose to disregard what you said.\n\nIt looks like he was trying to buy your affection which rarely works (or lasts). A gift is a gift and should not be expected to be returned if it doesn't work out. However, if you want nothing to do with him, but he's persistent about getting them back and won't leave you alone. It may be better to send them back just to get him out of your life.", "YTA. Give it back, why accept it in the first place?

They were a gift given freely, therefore you get to keep them.\n\n**However**, it does seem like once he started giving gifts, you had to have known that he was not aligned with your wants. I'm genuinely curious as to why you'd accept a bunch of gifts from someone who repeatedly told you they liked you more than what you were willing to offer.\n\nEdit to add: I think my question is getting lost in the sauce. OP says in her post \"*For the next few weeks he showered me in gifts, constantly, and also admitted that he was into me.*\". This is why I was asking why she let this go on for weeks when it sounds like he boundary stomped right away. \n\nI'm in no way \"victim blaming\", OP was clear with her boundary, he continued. I was simply asking why after even the first time he stated that he wasn't in the same place that this carried on. \n\nAs I said before, a gift is something people should be giving freely without expectation but the dude made his expectations known. OP didn't need to read his mind, he told her. It does seem like her accepting the gifts meant more to Bob than it did to her and OP seemingly knew this. When someone is giving you a gift and telling you how much they like you, you know that gift has strings attached.\n\nAgain, I stand firm in that OP is NTA, she was clear and the earrings were a gift. But that doesn't take away from the fact that I can see how Bob may have gotten himself confused.", "He tried to sway your mind with gifts after you clearly stated you didn\u2019t want to be more than casual, OP. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s necessarily harm in accepting the gifts, but understand that no man in a casual relationship is going to give you expensive gifts without having expectations of\u2026 something. It\u2019s entirely on him for not communicating those expectations, which is why I\u2019ve decided the way I have. NTA.", "NTA. Even if this had been a case of you changing your mind about a relationship (in general or with him in particular), this was a gift. A gift you hadn't requested but one he chose to give you. If someone gives gifts with the sole intent of getting something in return... guess what, that's not a gift. That's a payment.", "NTA, you made it clear from the start, and **kept** telling him that you weren't interested.

Why accept gifts from someone you have no intention of seeing apart from your hookups? Also, this wasn\u2019t the first gift, after a few tries you ought to have known what the intentions were and could have not accepted or returned some on your own. He\u2019s cheap and creepy, so let him have the one thing of his he wants back and be done with his creepy ass!", "NTA - and all other things aside, earrings are pretty personal.

It's shady to accept expensive gifts from people you aren't close with and don't want to be close with (the only exceptions to this are sw related).

But that said being shady isn't the same as being an AH especially when Bob was so insistent in the first place and ya all were FWBs.\n\nKeep the earrings, sure...

Giving you expensive gifts, no matter what he says, means he's really into you. That's the point where you should have broken it off, instead of going, well, he can buy me whatever he wants but it's still not going to get him anywhere. You'll say, \"I'm still not your girlfriend.\" He'll think, \"Yet, there you stand, wearing my jewelry like I'm your man. I'll have you in the end.\" There are men who are just really awkward with women, and have no idea how to get a woman to like them. They think casual hookups might parlay into something more meaningful if only they give expensive gifts, shower the woman with affection, or make demands. It never works. Though you were, indeed, clear up front that this was casual, your non spoken communication in accepting expensive jewelry gave him hope that you were changing your mind. I have a few guy friends who were adamant about not wanting a girlfriend. They'd hook up with a girl, put her in fwb status, and THEN shower them with gifts, fun vacations, dancing, until that girl who was totally fine hooking up got attached, and then weepy when he still didn't want to be her boyfriend. Two guys were like this. They would tell me, hey, I told her upfront I didn't want any relationship! Then I would say, well, then why did you treat all these ladies like girlfriends? Their actions very subtly led them on, and muddled boundaries. You didn't do anything wrong in accepting them, only that these kind of situations become more likely. This is one of the reasons why there used to be a long tradition in etiquette that a woman must not accept anything expensive from a man she does not want as a suitor. \n\nAlso, be careful having casual relationships with men you don't know well. There are so many crazy people out there. You never know when someone dangerous might cross your path. An angry confrontation might be just the beginning.   \n\n\nNo, you do not return gifts.

That would explain some things.", "No, OP says he told her, during the time he was giving her gifts, that he wanted them to be more than fwb.\n\nHe didn't turn into a creeper after the gifts were given, he was acting like a creeper and not respecting her boundaries, and TELLING her with actual words, that he wanted a real relationship, while he was giving her gifts.\n\nShe should have been turning down gifts from the start.\n\nHe is still the AH, but OP did a stupid thing here.", "Are you telling me you don't clean any earrings your given before wearing them?", "Yeah tbh i agree that people just shouldn't lead other people on", "Given his response do you think she felt safe to \u201cfirmly refuse\u201d?", "I always was taught to disinfect any new earrings, just like you wash any new clothes before wearing them unless it's like socks. def better safe than pus-filled haha", "For metal, the same way you'd clean your hands is probably enough, soap and water. I use those little fuzzy toothpick things to clean in the holes or under the gem settings if mine are getting gross. https://www.amazon.com.au/Piksters-Interdental-Brush-Pack-Ultra/dp/B01LWYJMG8\n\nResin or other non-porous materials would also be fine in soapy water with just finger rubbing or like a microfibre cloth. I'm not sure how wood would go, or something else porous. You'd need to let it dry thoroughly after cleaning, definitely.", "Jewelry cleaner or any jewelry store will clean them for you.", "I don't wear earrings, but yeah, I would definitely clean them first!", "It's not, but it's the kind of thing that gives these guys more ammo. He changed his mind. It sucks, he sucks. She's not the asshole if she doesn't, but it's the right thing to do.", "Agency and boundaries don\u2019t end at words, they are actions. A boundary without enforcement is nothing but pretty words that some people seem to think absolves them of any responsibility. If someone tells me they agree to my boundary, then repeatedly violate them, me simply restating the boundary isn\u2019t enough. I have to actually enforce it otherwise it\u2019s meaningless. \n\nSeems to me that OP made a half assed effort at shutting this guy down because she liked the gifts. Hopefully they both learn a lesson from this.", "She DID enforce her boundary though. She said she didn't want to be in a relationship, that she only wanted to stay friends, and she kept to that boundary. She didn't lead him on, he led himself on. From her perspective all she did was receive gifts from a friend.\n\nLet's take a moment to discuss the meaning of gifts. They are meant to be given. Given to show appreciation, to show respect, to make someone's day better, adoration, or to just make the other people happy. When I cover the bill with my friends, or throw a house party, or bring in donuts to the office, I'm not asking for a relationship. I don't expect anything more than a \"thank you\", or for the people to enjoy the gift, when I give gifts. \n\nGifts are not transactional. If they are transactional, they are no longer gifts. They are bribes, or an exchange, or a barter system. \n\nWhat the guy did wasn't give her \"gifts\", he was trying to bribe or buy her affection. She told him \"no\", and he thought he could change her mind. That's on him, not on her.", "Thanking them for the gem they gave you? Believe it or not, sex. /s,", "As a sea otter, do you have any more relatives?I\u2019d like to invite them to dinner.", "What about the personal responsibility on the part of the one *actively* giving gifts to someone who has explicitly and repeatedly stated their position that they don\u2019t want more than a RWB relationship?! Many people really struggle to enforce their personal boundaries. He just kept pushing and violating her boundaries and then, when she finally draws the line, he wants *her* to undo the consequences of *his* intentional actions by returning his expensive gift? No, that\u2019s not how the world works. A gift is a gift. If you give gifts stupidly, you shouldn\u2019t expect to get them back. She wasn\u2019t conning him into giving her these gifts; they were not expected, asked for or reciprocated."]}
