How about you just suck it up a little bit and do something nice for her? She invited you to join so it\u2019s not like she\u2019s excluding you.

Why are you not with her on her birthday, and who cares what you're wearing.", "ESH. \n\nShe shouldn't have called you to pick her up, but then wanted you to come drinking with them. You could be a little more understanding that it's her birthday (if this was a regular situation and a regular Friday night, I'd be more sympathetic to you being angry). Anyway, just go in the bar. Unless it  is a super exclusive place, no one is going to give a shit if you are underdressed.", "NTA\n\nShe is taking advantage of you and disrespecting your time. If she wanted to stay out longer she should have told you, instead of making you sit around and wait for her like a lap dog. I would not put up with it, but that\u2019s just me. Her and her friends are probably in the bar laughing about you waiting.", "YTA, but softly. Make sure she gets home safe with a sober driver, birthday or not. Then talk with her tomorrow night when sober and no longer hungover about what you were thinking and why, and see where the conversation goes from there. You can always update us later if you need more advice based on that convo. \n\nBut first priority is always to suck it up and be the DD if you already committed to it before hand, even if it comes with some unexpected changes to birthday plans.

Don't leave her stranded! That's so dangerous, especially for a woman who's been drinking. \n\nShe's being rather rude to keep you waiting but blame it mostly on the alcohol. You may want to go inside and check on her, though.", "Nta,  provided you make it clear you're leaving and know she has another way home ie Uber.", "YTA for safety reasons. You wouldn't be able to live it down if something happened, so make sure it doesn't. It's the right thing to do", "YTA.  You made a comitment and need to honor it.", "YWBTA - By this point, although initially it was a girls night, you've been invited in to join them for the birthday celebration.

Best to let her continue her birthday night with the girlfriends and go home and chill for a bit - as long as it\u2019s not a super far drive for you? It\u2019s definitely annoying to be put in that situation but that conversation can be had when she\u2019s sober if it still bothers you the next day imo.", "NTA. Drunk girls can be annoying and inconsiderate af. I've been in this exact situation. You're asking me to do you a favor, which I don't mind doing at all, but then you string me along for an hour? WTF? \n\nThe last time this happened to me, I didn't leave her there, but I was super pissed. I called her after repeated ignored texts and told her I was tired of waiting and she needed to get her ass out to the car now. She sent her friend out instead (whom I was also giving a ride). The friend told me my girl was having a good time talking to people at the bar, that I should calm down, and offered to make out with me while we waited. I briefly considered it, but I calmly told her no thank you and asked her to please go back in there and extract my girl so we could all go home.

Instead of making me wait in a car let me go home, shower and come back and if you want to go home okay and if you want to stay longer I\u2019ll come in now that I don\u2019t smell like ass", "Sorry, yeah she told me it would be one more drink at the original bar, then they told me they were going to have that drink at another bar", "Like if she did this often, or on some random night, or with little notice I would say he is not TA. But it\u2019s her birthday, she communicated, she invited, she asked him ahead of time, etc. I also think 30 minutes for one last drink isn\u2019t so crazy. \n\nOP scroll on Reddit for a bit and time will fly by", "After thinking about it a bit more, I agree with you. \nYTA, not a massive one, but still. \nOP was invited to join but felt underdressed, so he chose not to go in. That's not on the girlfriend, who gives a crap how you are dressed in a bar, it's not a club. 10pm is very early for a birthday night. She told OP it would be later before he even arrived at the spot, so he could have already said to get a taxi home at that point. Naive to expect she'd be done in 20 minutes after her friend came. Just be nice and don't ruin her birthday. And next time don't volunteer if you don't really want to.", "I agree with what you are saying, but would vote NAH. It would be a nice thing to do, but if he chooses not to that's ok too (as long as there's a head's up and the option for her to go with him, as stated).", "I was kind of leaning towards n t a bit because I get that it can be annoying waiting on someone who keeps extending the wait time, but after reading yours, you changed my mind. Well said, especially the birthday gift part.

He made a previous post.  Her birthday was a couple of days ago and they celebrated then.  This was a post birthday celebration with her girl posse. Some of the girls last minute added their boyfriends so OP made plans based on the original girls night out thing.  Now there is still the safety issue, but originally she would have had to get home on her own.\n\nStill not an ideal situation, but not enough to warrant a Y T A since she told him to come get her and then extended it twice.", "Birthday doesn't equal \"i can be annoying and inconsiderate of my partner whos doing me a favour\".", "If she can afford all these bars the girls can afford their own way home :/", "He is trying to. She won\u2019t let him. So just leave and let them catch an Uber", "So her saying she was getting ready to leave and that he should come get her isn't a commitment?

I think you should go.", "He already said why he doesn't want to go in, he's tired and isn't dressed properly. Why does he HAVE to go in?

That's what an adult would do.", "He doesn't have to go in, same way they don't have to be in a relationship. It's her birthday, she's having fun at a bar and inviting him in.

It is her birthday celebration.", "It's not her birthday any more.  That was a couple days ago.  She told him she was just about done and then extended it twice.

It's not an excuse to be rude to people under the guise of celebrating.", "I disagree with you. She sounds that she wants him to be around. She is even get annoyed when he doesn't join then.\n\nAnd even if they already did celebrate together, it still her birthday and I think is reasonable of her to wants he join the other celebration.", "That seems cold. I don't agree. I really enjoy spoil my loved ones in their birthdays.", "She didn\u2019t want him there originally. She asked for a girls night and the BF obliged and took her out earlier in the week.", "She could easily be around him by leaving.  Also drunk people and bars are just not that fun for the driver you know."]}
