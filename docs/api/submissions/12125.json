Next time he sends you something just reply for him to stop.  Honestly, his sadness or sense of rejection because you don't watch the videos he sends is kind of silly, and also not your problem.", "\u201cDude, I appreciate that you think of me when you see something on YouTube and forward it to me. But I gotta tell that I kind of avoid YT. The rabbit hole is too real and I just don\u2019t want to go down it. Any chance you could dial back on sending me the video links, or just stop? Thanks.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA if you do say something. You would be tho if you didn\u2019t say anything and then altered your friendship without letting him know why.\n\nI had a colleague who was alllllwayyyys sending me those \u2018pass it on to 15 friends or you will have bad luck\u2019 chain email. It was easily 4 or 5 a week.\n\nI finally sat her down and said that I appreciated her thinking of me but that I am not interested in being a person she uses to get her quota of \u2018friends\u2019 to satisfy the email and that I don\u2019t believe in the emails ability to bring me (good or bad) luck.\nShe was upset but she stopped sending them and we\u2019re still work friends.", "NTA. Verbally tell him to cut back on the videos he sends you so he can\u2019t misconstrue what you say via text. And even a white lie to soften the blow won\u2019t be hurtful here bc it seems like you do care if his feelings get hurt. I would just casually be like man, I know you\u2019ve sent me a bunch of videos but I\u2019m just so busy with x, y, z I haven\u2019t been able to watch them and it\u2019ll probably be a while since I don\u2019t watch YouTube that much.", "sounds like one needs to work on boundaries and communication skills. So you're getting pissed off rather than tell them?...umm yea yta to yourself. Treat yourself with more respect. What's the big deal with telling(not yellng and being a dick) them...yo I don't watch that stuff so please don't send it anymore...your sanity is worth more than his getting butt hurt by telling him to stop texting......or just block him, Either way ...treat yourself better", "Mild YTA for not doing anything to fix this.  You could either:\n\n1) politely tell him (best option), or \n\n2) configure your social media to archive/delete/whatever this stuff.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Say you got a virus from opening a video and not risking it again. You really appreciate him thinking of you but too wary to open any video you don't vet yourself for foreseeable future.", "NTA. This bothers me too. It makes me feel somewhat beholden to provide a reaction to, essentially, things I could usually care less about. It feels intrusive, like I'm always accessible to people because of social media, and now I have to find time to watch this silly video that's been sent to me besides.", "I'm sorry but he's going to need to sit in that rejection. It's not your responsibility to gatekeep his feelings, and it sounds like you have already tried the 'take a hint' approach. Nta", "NTA. As someone who has never gotten into YouTube, I completely understand your frustration. I would talk to your co-worker. Tell them it\u2019s not personal, you just have no interest.", "Good answer but two spots that need to be more assertive.  \"kind of avoid \" - tell them you don't watch it.  Period.  \"Any chance to dial it back?\" - just tell them to stop.", "Excellent strategy to ensure he doesn't send you others too", "\"I don't watch YouTube, Man.
