We lived in the same house for 20 years but we barely know each other. \n\nHe just never seemed that interested in me when I was a kid. He was the main breadwinner and worked hard to financially provide for us. He\u2019d leave the house at 9am and come back at 10pm six to seven days a week; as a result, I never saw him much. When I did see him, he never asked me questions about myself or my life. He became more interested when I was a teenager, but by then it was too late and I wanted nothing to do with him. \n\nIt\u2019s his birthday next weekend and my mom wants me to go to his birthday dinner. It\u2019s a 90 min drive. I don\u2019t want to go because I don\u2019t like him and I don\u2019t have a relationship with him at all. I\u2019d rather spend my Saturday doing something else. My mom says I\u2019m extremely selfish for this and  that my dad financially provided for us and never abused us so I should be grateful and love him. \n\nHowever the memories I have of him growing up are negative. He said sexist things (eg women should be in the kitchen helping prepare food, I should dress more femininely), he told me more than once when I was a kid that I needed plastic surgery for my nose and eyes, and he disapproved of my tomboyish hobbies because it wasn\u2019t more feminine. \n\nWhat makes it more ironic is that my dislike of him is also due to my mom constantly badmouthing him when I was a kid. I am a classic example of \u201cgirl with daddy issues\u201d where I crave approval/attention from older men and am pretty much and have always been only attracted to men 15-25 years older than me. Every man I am attracted to, I also want them to be my dad. It\u2019s messed up, it\u2019s caused me a lot of grief, and I can\u2019t help but blame my dad for this. \n\nBut maybe my mom is right and I am being too harsh on him? He did not have an easy life, a lot of his sexism comes from Korean culture (he moved to the States in his early 20s), his parents are also very emotionally unavailable, and I can\u2019t help but believe that I also contributed to our broken relationship. When I was a teenager he\u2019d try to talk to me more and I\u2019d ignore him. When he came into a room, I\u2019d leave it. I also can\u2019t tell if this is just how all Korean dads are, and I\u2019m judging him too harshly by western cultural standards. \n\nSo AITA here? He did provide for me financially my whole life and could have been a way worse dad. Do I owe him to go to this birthday dinner?", "created_utc": 1667554436, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yltzhb/aita_for_not_going_to_my_emotionally_absent_dads/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did agree, parents should do the parenting.   \n\n\nYou grow up, you learn a lot and now learning what is good and what is wrong. So did your father, he didn't neglect you and tried to provide for you financially and try to be close to you as you said when you were a teen.   \n\n\nMy family is like that too, but I did see my dad change when I'm older and try to see his pov towards life. Maybe going to his birthday dinner will bring you guys closer together, or just chat. It will be nice for your dad too.", "YTA he did what he knows, did it consistently and provided for you. Sounds like an unappreciated gesture in his life of 20 years in his home. You can at least celebrate a birthday with him, oh but it's 90 minutes away, that's really it. Wouldn't give him a day out of your life for his happiness would you if he's not working his ass off. Is a handout for college next for you, and from who?", "NTA\n\nWhile I have sympathy for your dad- it sounds like he was behaving in the only way he knew in terms of being distant while you were young and then taking more interest when you grew up- it doesn't make up for him saying cruel things to you as a child, and it's also not your fault that as a teen, you spurned his efforts: why on earth would you have wanted to spend time with him after a childhood of being ignored?\n\nIt's up to you what you do: if you decide not to go, fine. If you decide to go in order to try and build bridges, fine. You shouldn't feel guilty for not going or foolish for going after all. Decide what relationship you want with your dad and act accordingly- and remember also that you bear ABSOLUTELY no blame for your lack of relationship with him now. Your feelings- both now and as a teenager are valid.", "It's fine for you to feel what you feel, and it's up to you if you want to reconcile with your father.  \n\nYou're old enough that it should be possible to do that now (also depending on him somewhat), and it might be a way to work on some of your other issues, but it will require the kind of honest, painful conversation that probably doesn't belong at a birthday party. \n\nIf you decide that's *not* what you want though, it doesn't make you an AH. You're human and it's not wrong to have feelings, so you're NTA.", "NAH.\n\nI feel I'll be in the minority here ... but people handle the challenges of life in different ways, and show their love in different ways. We are also in large part a product of our own upbringing. It sounds like this man never quite knew how to connect to his family. It also sounds like he worked long days to provide for you. You may have struggled to connect, but that's not the same as you not being at the forefront of his mind as he struggled through life.\n\nI say give him the benefit of the doubt to some extent and maybe try to connect to some degree on your own terms. He won't be around forever, and the chance will be gone with him.", "You kind of admitted to yourself mom put things in your head about your father. You admit he was basically working almost 80 hrs a week to put a roof over your head, clothes on your back and food on the table. You may not have been wealthy but something says you didn't really go without and that's due to your father busting his butt to provide for a family that included you. If your father didn't love his family, he would not put in 80 hrs a week.\n\nUnfortunately the things you needed and the things you wanted weren't free. Someone had to provide for them and your father was the one that did that. It sucks he had to be away so long but it sounds as though he may be slowing down so it may mean an opportunity to get to know him other than as the job.", "NTA for not wanting to go to his birthday. You have your reasons. You also know there are explanations to how your father has been his whole life. It's not like he chose to be emotionally absent, that was imposed on him.\n\nAlso, N T A for not having been able to build up a relation with your father when you were a teen. You both had your issues and it wasn't your fault, but if someone needs to feel guilty, the adult person was him, not you.\n\nNow, you have the choice to go to that birthday dinner and have some good-terms relation with your father, as in paying him some respect for what he has done right in his life. If you go, it's your choice, for you. It would be on your own terms. It could help you with your daddy issues to see your father more as a human being with flaws than an absent father.\n\nObviously, if you go, you are also N T A.\n\nThe AS is the guy in this thread recommending you to cut off completely your father.", "What do you want for an end result? You seem to be on the fence. If you want to give your relationship another chance now that you're an adult and can handle it better go, if you want to cut him out of your life don't go.

Your mom bad mouthing him obvi didn\u2019t help at all and you deserved warmth and love.\n\nBut you\u2019re 30 years old now. It\u2019s time to stop blaming dad for your bad taste in men. You\u2019re very self aware so use that when choosing a partner. Stop chasing your dad in others.\n\n\nSo take a step back and think about what you want to do next. Go NC/LC with your dad or try to make a relationship?", "YTA. At the end of the day, he\u2019s still your dad. According to you, he provided for you and it seems, at least based on your post, that there is nothing glaring that he did to you negatively except be \u201ccold\u201d/ \u201cdistant\u201d which is not exactly unique. Not all parents will be warm, rainbows, and butterflies. At the same time, I am sure no kid is a 100% perfect kid to a parent. You said you didn\u2019t see him much when you were a kid because he was working. I get it that he could have done better but he was working for YOU and your family. He should be applauded and appreciated for being able to sustain such kind of work life. It must have been exhausting. At the same time, maybe you do your own introspection too.", "NTA.\n\nYou are an adult now and you can make your own decisions and know who and what is good for your mental health/life. I know some people might say that you might be the AH and tells you that \u2018he is still family\u2019 or like what your mom said \u2018he raised you financially\u2019. I am in somewhat similar situation where my dad thinks he is a good dad because he support us financially and give our basic needs when we were kids. Supporting your kids financially is a basic parent responsibility. \n\nit will be either just cut your dad in your life or tell them how you felt about it or at least be honest why you didn\u2019t want to go. When I cut off my ties with my dad, he exactly know why I did it but then he fucked up again by saying \u2018i can just look at their picture and I don\u2019t need to see them\u2019 ( considering he still has 2 minor kids that needs a dad figure). But, I agree with some people when they say that you should go to a therapy to assess your thoughts better about your dad/family.", "NTA. Even if it is the standard for Korean dads (and I don\u2019t think it is or should be), that doesn\u2019t mean you need to accept a shitty standard.", "ESH", ">when I was a kid that I needed plastic surgery for my nose and eyes\n\nWHAT THE FUCK\n\n> a lot of his sexism comes from Korean culture (he moved to the States in his early 20s)\n\naaaaaaahhh. that oddly explains some things. \n\nAnyway, putting that aside. \n\nYou don't *owe* him to go.  But by your own admission it seems like he tried to make an effort at some point but you shut him down. If you are at all interested in having a semblance of a relationship with him you should go. Outright refusing to go to his birthday, you might as well go NC after that. \n\nBut to answer the actual question at hand, I think soft YTA. He obviously wasn't a great dad but he doesn't seem outlandishly bad. Given cultural differences it might just be he didn't know how else to care. I think an afternoon or evening once a year is a small price to pay.", "I agree NAH. I grew up in a similar way. Difference between my mom had a chronic illness. So my dad would work long hours then come home and help with dinner and daily chores, as well as taking care of my mom on the bad days. Saturdays we'd get up early for a more through house clean.  He wasn't a very openly emotional person, I literally can't think of a single time he said he loved me or was proud of me.  So naturally I couldn't stand him and couldn't wait to distance myself from him as an adult. \n\nHowever, as an adult and raising high need kids of my own, I've come to understand him better. In a world where so many parents bail when life gets to hard, he stayed. He worked his ass off to provide for us and pay mom's medical bills. After that long day, he came home and was there making sure we did our part to keep the house running, and he took care of my mom until she passed away, which becamenearly a full time job itself towards the end. His love didn't look how I wanted it to, but it was there. His parents were also emotionally distant so I know he was showing love the best way he knew.\n\nAfter mom died we struggled to connect but we're still in contact. We'll never be as close as I was with my mom, but that's ok. He can tell me he loves me now and he often asks about me or the kids when we talk, so I know he cares.\n\nI hope OP can get to the point where she can maturely look back and see her father's love for what it is and accept him how he is. She shouldn't expect a fairytale reunion with tears and hugs. But hopefully she can't get to a point of acceptance not resentment. Who knows, hopefully she can learn to love him as he is.", "It's customary for Korean parents to gift plastic surgery for their kids' 18th bday. Guess the dad was just trying to be a good dad the way he knew it but it sounded awful because OP wasn't raised in that society/culture."]}
