I (16f) always sort of knew what happened but it was only as I got a little older that I understand. In the space of a week we went from a seemingly happy family, and I sure thought we were, to my dad living with someone else and having to spend time between two houses and one of those houses had my dad and some pregnant woman being all lovey dovey with each other.\n\nMy half brother was the result of that cheating and my dad's relationship with that pregnant woman.\n\nMy dad and half brother's mother married but when he was 2 she divorced my dad and stopped being part of my half brother's life.\n\nWhen my half brother was 4 he started trying to come to my mom's house with me. He'd wait at the window expecting to see her come, despite her only showing up to my dad's twice and never coming in. He used to run over to her and want her attention and love. I guess since he saw her hug and kiss me and be all mom like with me, he wanted her to be the same with him. My mom has always been very uncomfortable around my half brother. She has never said anything. But I don't think she has ever wanted to be around him. Mostly she avoids times where they would be in the same place. Or she sits far apart from my dad where possible.\n\nAs my half brother got older he started talking about my mom more. Then I was spending more time at mom's than dad's and when I would be at dad's and he would ask me to call mom so he could talk to her and now it's at the worst it has ever been. I had mentioned this stuff to dad before and he told me he was working on things with my half brother. But I now realize that was a lie because my half brother has been having some big issues emotionally.\n\nLast Mother's Day he made a card for my mom and dropped it off at our house. The card asked if she would be his mom too. I know my mom talked to dad about that after. He did a school project and he talked about my mom like she was his mom. Then last weekend I heard my half brother cry in bed and since I heard him ask dad about mom earlier that day, I assume it was the whole thing getting to him.\n\nI stopped by dad's after school, when my half brother wasn't home, and told him he needs to get my half brother or he'll end up one messed up kid in a few years. I said this is torturing him and he knows mom does not want to be my half brother's mom. I told my dad he let it go on too long.

Your mom obviously wants nothing to do with your half brother, and that does need to be made clear to him in a way he can understand but know isn't his fault.  Based on your age and my guess at his, that's going to be rough, but your dad cannot expect your mom to be a part of the kids life in any meaningful way.\n\nAlso it seems like something is going on with his mom, which while not your direct business, may be a large part of the issue too.  You were right to tell your dad that he needs to deal with it, this is his fault.  Best you can do is not get in the middle of it.\n\nGood luck.", "Poor boy.

He's been abandoned by his mom and seeing his half-sister having a loving one while he doesn't will do some real big things to a young mind.  And your dad, while it sounds like he's at least taking responsibility, well his AH behavior isn't giving me warm feelings about his caring and nurturing side to fill that dual-role.\n\nBeyond therapy, seeing as you seemingly want a relationship with him, all you can do is be his sister, but be sure to set and keep clear boundaries as this is going to get worse before getting better.  If you're lucky you'll be out of the house and away to college, work, or whatever by then.\n\nGood luck."]}
