He needs to step up and be a parent to both his children, but especially to that poor abandoned little boy. What a piece of work that man is.", "Can you ask your half brother s school to at least give him some counseling since your father is a lazy ah who doesn't take care of his RESPONSIBILITIES?\n\nNTA", "I am glad your half brother at least has an older sister who does care about him. Perhaps you could explain to him that while he doesn't have a mom, through no fault of his own, at least he does have a big sister who loves him very much, and not everyone is lucky enough to have one. My sister (actually half sister)  is 11 years younger than me. Her mother and my father divorced when she was 2 and I took care of her. Now she is 33 and I am 44 and she is one of my closest, dearest friends. I hope that you and your half brother will have a good relationship as well when you are older. Thank you for looking out for his well being when it seems there are no responsible adults in his life. You are a good person.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s taking responsibility at all when he\u2019s telling op she should talk to her mom about it instead of him. What the eff. Her half brother has nothing to do with her. Sounds like her dad wants ops mom to step in. \n\nOp you should talk to your brother about things. See what your dad has told him. Do you have any paternal aunts or grandma that you could talk to about checking in? It definitely seems like he wants your mom to step in and he could be telling your brother some messed up things especially with how rarely your brother sees her.", "Seems obvious the dad knows what he should do, but wants to take the easy route and get the kid's hopes up and cross his fingers OP convinces her mum to try. \n\nIt'd be easy to get therapy and try other things, but that takes actual effort. Doing what you want, expecting others to pick up the pieces is vastly easier."]}
