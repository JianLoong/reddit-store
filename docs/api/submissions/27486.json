He'd wait at the window expecting to see her come, despite her only showing up to my dad's twice and never coming in. He used to run over to her and want her attention and love. I guess since he saw her hug and kiss me and be all mom like with me, he wanted her to be the same with him. My mom has always been very uncomfortable around my half brother. She has never said anything. But I don't think she has ever wanted to be around him. Mostly she avoids times where they would be in the same place. Or she sits far apart from my dad where possible.\n\nAs my half brother got older he started talking about my mom more. Then I was spending more time at mom's than dad's and when I would be at dad's and he would ask me to call mom so he could talk to her and now it's at the worst it has ever been. I had mentioned this stuff to dad before and he told me he was working on things with my half brother. But I now realize that was a lie because my half brother has been having some big issues emotionally.\n\nLast Mother's Day he made a card for my mom and dropped it off at our house. The card asked if she would be his mom too. I know my mom talked to dad about that after. He did a school project and he talked about my mom like she was his mom. Then last weekend I heard my half brother cry in bed and since I heard him ask dad about mom earlier that day, I assume it was the whole thing getting to him.\n\nI stopped by dad's after school, when my half brother wasn't home, and told him he needs to get my half brother or he'll end up one messed up kid in a few years. I said this is torturing him and he knows mom does not want to be my half brother's mom. I told my dad he let it go on too long.
