So my partner and I (both 30) live alone, I appreciate my own space and we are at an age where living with roommates is a thing of the past. My partner is from a foreign country and he has a friend visiting who was originally coming to stay with us for a week or two. This plan has now changed to he is living with us for about 2 months, and will contribute a lesser portion of rent than us (he will pay around 25% and my partner and I will pay the 75% between us) and will contribute to power bills but not internet or anything like that. I would also like to point out that the new plan of him staying for 2 months instead of 2 weeks was not discussed with me, my partner told his friend that it was okay, and as I get on well with the friend I figure 2 months would be manageable. So the friend arrived yesterday and has already been on tinder and is planning dates with girls, and to be perfectly honest I am worried about him having lots of overnight guests and that is the absolute last thing I want considering we originally lived alone for a reason. Considering the friend will only be contributing a small portion to the household, how much of an AH would I be to implement rules when it comes to overnight guests should it become a problem?\n\nEdit: Yes I am very aware my partner is an AH for not running this by me first, but as it is only 2 months and not longer I am okay to deal with it.", "created_utc": 1675215146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qgtu3/aita_for_not_allowing_our_temporary_guest_to_have/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can hook up at their place or get a hotel.

That's very unfair.  I would set the firm boundary about guests, and if this visitor doesn't like it he can stay elsewhere.", "NTA. Your partner not talking to you before offering a friend to stay for multiple months is a massive \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA but I see this arrangement lasting longer than 2 months, make sure you tell the friend and your partner that you won't accept any longer than that. Your partner is a huge AH.", "NTA better bring it up with your partner before you wake up to a stranger in the hallway", "NTA. I would be VERY careful with this situation and research tenancy laws in your area before allowing him to stay any longer than the original plan.", "NTA just say no guests, period. If they don\u2019t like it, they can pay 25% rent somewhere else.", "Your partner is the AH. You should have set a firm boundary.", "NTA you can set whatever rules you want for your home. I personally wouldn\u2019t charge someone rent if they couldn\u2019t do what they please with the space though. I would probably just let them stay as a friend visiting another country and tell them no strangers allowed over without charging them any rent.", "NTA.  I would suggest that if he starts dating one person in a serious way, you can revisit the rule, but no random hookups at your place.  He\u2019s supposed to be there to visit, you\u2019re not running a b&b.", "Nta, but I would put in a bunch of rules. I had family stay with me for 4 days and it was too much. You allowing the 2 months and not pushing back hard baffles me. No extra guests, he breaks ONE RULE, I would have him out of there.", "NTA, but damn, seriously, you need to set boundaries and do it NOW. I would be livid if my partner told someone they could stay with us for 2 months without consulting me, and I get serious vibes that your temporary housemate will be taking full advantage of your hospitality.", "NTA just tell him and your husband you don\u2019t need this place to be an open swinging door. You don\u2019t feel random people coming in and out of your house is acceptable. It\u2019s that simple plus it\u2019s a safety issue and it\u2019s not his house.", ">This plan has now changed to he is living with us for about 2 months, and will contribute a lesser portion of rent than us (he will pay around 25% and my partner and I will pay the 75% between us) and will contribute to power bills but not internet or anything like that.\n\nThis is a terrible idea and it's going to turn into a mess.

Charging him rent makes him more entitled to things like guests"]}
