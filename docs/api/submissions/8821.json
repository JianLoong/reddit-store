Charging him rent makes him more entitled to things like guests", "NTA. You need to have a written contract clearly outlining that his residency with you is ONLY 2 months, and no guests. Also outline what he will be paying for those 2 months. Honestly, I would not agree to him being with you that long, because at that point he will have established residency with you, and even with the written contract it will be a pain to get rid of him because the will likely not leave willingly on his own and you will have to go through eviction procedures just to get him out which will add on however many months that ends up taking. The only thing the contract will truly provide is that if there is a breach of contract you can evict him immediately (make sure that is also clearly in the contract), therefore shortening the amount of time you'd have to put up with him.", "NTA", "It\u2019s really not safe for your place to be available for his possible hookups. He shud stay at their place or a hotel. Two months is barely enough time to end up in a long term relationship where you could consider relaxing this rule. So keep it to no overnight guests and that will help encourage him to find his own place perhaps?  Along with you setting a firm boundary with your husband about when this guy needs to be gone.", "NTA. Reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nJust make don't become those parents in that post a day or so ago who were banging on their son's room door while he was having sex and telling that the woman had to leave \ud83d\ude02", "> but as it is only 2 months and not longer I am okay to deal with it.\n\nYou realize it probably is going to be longer right? \n\nOutside of older, retired relatives and in-laws coming to help after the birth of a child, family death etc two month \u201cvisits\u201d are not a thing. \n\nOnce you get past a month, the person is no longer \u201cvisiting\u201d they are **living** with you. They are a short-term resident/household member.  \n\nThe only people who can \u201cvisit\u201d for two months and change from a 1-2 week trip to two months are people who have no responsibilities back home and have no rush, need, or desire to return.  You are GETTING A ROOMMATE girl!\n\nSo I guess my verdict is LOL for thinking this will work. Good luck trying to tell him he can\u2019t have overnight guests if the situation comes up. \u201cI\u2019m contributing to rent so I have the right to guests.\u201d \u201cI am entitled to comfort while I\u2019m here.

Not wanting strangers to come around your house is completely normal. I'd make an exception after a few weeks. For example, if things are really going well and he wants you two to meet his GF, I think that would be different. Dating in a new town is a completely normal way to find friends. However, pending on his style, it can get weird really quick for private people like yourself.", "I am so sorry you have to go through this situation OP. Your partner is AH for enabling his friend staying with you for months without consulting you. I think you can discuss it first with you new \"roommate\" about the terms. Thinking about it is reasonable in my opinion, as long as you'll discuss it.

It\u2019s your home and it\u2019s your right to lay down the rules.  Your boyfriend should have let you know about the two months stay and he is remiss for not doing so.  Set firm rules and keep them.", "NTA. Tell your partner and guest immediately that he may not have people over at all. He can meet them at their house or go to a hotel. Get a ring camera if you don't already have one.", "NTA\n\nI suggest it just not happen.\n\nInviting random hookups could result in theft and issues like that.\n\nHe's paying to be there so he's not exactly a guest and will have expectations.\n\nCompromise would be to contribute more until you're happy with the situation or just not to entertain it.", "NTA **if** you make it clear to both the friend **and** your partner right **now**. \n\nI'm seriously side-eyeing the jump from two *weeks* to two *months*. I don't know what country the friend is coming from but it sounds like less of a holiday and more like a job/house scouting trip for them. I'm half expecting your partner to start dropping hints about this friend living with you or sponsoring their visa.", "NTA but will your partner back you on this?", "And OP really should implement those rules before the situation rears its ugly head.  I had a friend come stay with me when I was living in a desirable location (all of a sudden, too many people came out of the woodwork to 'visit us'), didn't discuss it beforehand, then he brought over random people.  His one-night stand let my cat out (luckily, we were in an apartment complex and he was just outside the door, but I was pretty livid).", ">You realize it probably is going to be longer right?\n\nGood point. Also, I have always thought there should be an LOL verdict so full support there!", "NTA\u2026but once you start charging rent fees or utility fees that person is no longer a guest.  I do not know where you live, but in the US, this would give that person certain rights and if he so wanted to, he could be staying longer than two months because you established a precedent.  As for the guests, tell him, no.  Put your foot down.  He wants \u201cextra\u201d he can go to their place.", "NTA, especially since you're being gracious about something that wasn't discussed with you in advance.", "NTA. Your house, your rules. And do make sure to thoroughly discuss with your partner about this. Come to think of it, might be a good idea to have a talk with your partner about arbitrarily making decisions that impact the both of you.", "NTA. And since this has not happened yet, I would suggest to inform his friend now about your rules and if he doesn't agree he can by all means find another place to stay.", "NTA! You\u2019re talking about Tinder dates. Not a friend or relationship that has been going on for a long time, or someone you and your husband know already. I wouldn\u2019t want strangers in my house either.", "NTA but tell your partner explicitly \"The condition of me accepting this 2 month stay is that your friend gets no overnight guests or sexual partners inside our home. If he violates this rule even once, he has to leave. No second chances, his belongings will be put outside if he doesn't take them himself.

You need to communicate with him, and your partner needs to be the one to set this rule. And your partner has to do so without blaming you or throwing you under the bus. He needs to tell his friend, \u201chey we are doing you a favor by letting you stay with us for this long, but I am not comfortable with you bringing strangers over.

I was in a similar situation and two weeks turned into seven months. Thankfully, I wasn\u2019t living with a partner, but I eventually threatened to leave, as I was paying and the squatter wasn\u2019t, but he was still legally considered a tenant due to the amount of time.

Like at that point just don't have guests. If he is from another country, odds are he isn't going to try to illegally squat at his friends house so he can continue hooking up with chicks. Cmon", "And now they\u2019ll have to do eviction paperwork if they want him to leave. Big yikes.", "Have to admit my first thought was \"hmmm... charging rent (even a nominal amount) but he's not allowed to have any guests over...\".  \n\n OP, like any roommate, a rule about not having a revolving door of people is reasonable.  Trying to say no guests while he is paying?  Not reasonable.\n\nI think the BF is TA for agreeing without discussing with OP so NTA.", "NTA but (1) partner and I would be having a serious talk.\n(2) all three of us would have an open discussion of expectations, I.e. overnight guests, cleaning kitchen, foods off limits, a FIRM leaving/move out date.", "NTA\n\nHe can go and sleep over at his dates\u2019 place. This behaviour is likely to get you robbed.\n\nYour partner is a huge AH for letting this arrangement change without your consent, and also an idiot because it\u2019ll make your guest an equal tenant. If he decides he doesn\u2019t want to leave after 60 days of continuous residency you\u2019ll have to evict him which costs money and time.", "NTA", "NTA. And even though your making excuses for your partner, he is the biggest AH, and will certainly find ways to push further in the future.", "NTA - make a month to month lease and get EVERYTHING in writing.   Check tenant laws in your state to protect yourself. \n\nEspecially since your partner didn't include you in this major event.", "NTA,  enough, I wouldn't like randomers wandering round my house. The things you might see,(shivers). The things you will hear. Oh my. Nope.", "It's already gone from two weeks to two months without pause for thought, he's planning dates and discussing his contribution towards bills like he's moving in...  you are about to have this 'guest' stay for a lot, LOT longer.\n\nUnless you put your foot down now. YWNBTA\nMake rules, make them known and enforce them. This is your house he's to be a _very temporary_ guest in.", "If they don\u2019t give him a key, then it\u2019s likely that he will start leaving their door unlocked, so that he can come & go without needing to wait for someone to let him in every single time. Or he\u2019ll choose to stay in the apartment the entire time he\u2019s there instead of going out, meaning that OP & their partner will never get a break from him.", "After 2 months just change the locks.", "I would feel suffocated by someone staying in my house for 24 hours, 2 months is insane", "That's long enough to establish tenancy in some areas. OPs boyfriend is playing a fickle game agreeing to that long; I hope in 2 months time dude actually moves out as originally agreed.", "NTA but do you see how quickly that 2 weeks turned into 2 months? I have a feeling he'll be there longer than 2 months.", "NTA. Absolutely no overnight guests. He's free to pay for a hotel for the night, but it sounds like it's already going sideways and you're probably going to have to pull the plug long before 2 months are up if this is how it's starting out.", "NTA. If he wants a love shack, he should seek alternative arrangements at a hotel. I wouldn't want nor tolerate complete strangers in my home without my approval.", "NTA\n\nThis is a big YIKES for me. Rules need to be established NOW, SO has to be ready to stand behind them when friend starts to want to bend them or a serious discussion needs to happen between you and SO about your expectations after 2 months pass and this friend is still there breaking your perfectly fine rules.", "NTA. He can go to their place or a hotel.", "No, it doesn't. When you rent a room in a house, you typically agree to abide by a set of house rules set by the homeowner. If you don't like the rules, find a different place to rent."]}
