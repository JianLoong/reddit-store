Do you know whether they go along with this kind of humor (for the half-joke part) or this kind of feedback (for the half-serious part)?\n2. Message. Husbands being uptight because they aren't sexually satisfied is an old stereotype that ignores at least one other side: that often, women aren't as interested in sex because of all the other things that they have to do. There are also other considerations that may be specific to these women. Does what you're saying affirm their experience or dismiss it?\n3. Moment.

I\u2019m reading the word \u201cmisogynistic\u201d thrown around a lot here and to me, it detracts from the gravity of the word having it used with no abandon. If anything, it\u2019s a bit misandrist to suggest that such a complex problem could have such an easy solution. \n\nI believe that in a marriage, a person\u2019s duty should be to their partner and sensing what he/she/x needs. If your dude needs a bj, give him a bj! If your lady needs some flowers and cuddles or to be gone down on, you do those things!

Absolutely not. \n\nYou touched a nerve and made them self-reflect, if even for a fraction of a second, that they are not upholding their end of a happy marriage and that is why they are giving you the cold shoulder. Yes, they feel dismissed and you were a bit flippant about your remark, but your words touched on an issue that may be a reoccurring theme in their marriages. Was their uptight reaction because of their husbands\u2019 moods or are the husbands\u2019 moods uptight because of them? Who knows? But people seriously need to lighten the fuck up. There\u2019s too much going on in the world to be this thin-skinned.  However, if you like having them as friends, you should apologize. If you can do without them, you should at least explain your piece and move forward and find friends more suited to your humor. \n\nCould there be more to this story that you\u2019re not telling us or don\u2019t know to be telling us and that you are in fact the AH in this situation? Sure. \nIs it a woman\u2019s duty to keep a man happy? Hell no. That would be misogynistic. Is it a husband/wife\u2019s duty to keep their partner happy to the best of their ability? 100%.\n\nEdit: after reading a lot of the downvoted comments, I realize I havent even thought of the immaturity and passive aggressiveness of the cold shoulder treatment.

You made a joke that didn't land right.", "NAH.  Everyone needs to lighten up.\n\nEven if meant halfheartedly and said in a joking manner, this isn\u2019t anything to get too upset about.

Everyone's LOVE language is different, maybe they don't realize that touch is an important love language. If you're spouse is having a tough day and you haven't even sat next to them, held hands or even just kiss them, they could be feeling like they don't matter. It could make them withdraw if they feel unwanted when already stressed. My spouse and I share the same major two love languages touch and service, we are affectionate and do things for each other. Honestly from what little information is here sounds like it's a complete lack of communication in their marriage as they'd rather talk about the problem with friends then communicate with their spouse. Just because he's a man doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings, people including men aren't cold and distant for no reason. TBH the majority of the responses on here are why men have a higher suicide rate and are just toxic. From the information given and what's in your comments, they make the same kind of jokes. This time they got offended and in those types of situations it's usually because the joke hit too close. Why I think it should have been followed with real conversation.  I bet if they actually had solid real communication with their husbands they probably find that their husbands feel like they do. It's easy to feel like you are doing everything by yourself and the other person is distant if you don't engage in  meaningful conversation. ESH.", "I think YTA in their eyes for sure. I get you were trying to keep it light and funny.

He is getting off on instructing them to give blowjobs. He is literally wanking off to it.", "People who vent don't always want a suggestion. This! My sister will always ask me if I need her to listen, or if i'd like advice before I start getting into things. If I start rambling, she won't offer any advice unless I ask for it. Its something that we don't do enough of.", "Now hold on... we should give it a try", "Propositioned?", "I thought so.", "Thank you! I want to be friends with you and your wife, lol.", "Thought you might!", "I like that!", "Well... Instead of \"put a CORK in it\", replace the R with a C. That was OP's helpful advice.", "I don\u2019t know about the stigma of sex fixes everything but it seems to be that bjs are a big part of people\u2019s sex lives and it seems to me that it seems to me more of a one sided love affair but who knows how that could be fixed.", "Admit it. You were wanking off to it later.", "You have some very weird complexes my friend", "[removed]", "Oh please. So what you meant is \u201cyour husbands grumpy so YOU should have some fun!\u201d ? Lol", "The day after my grandpa died who raised me for the better half of my life some guy from tinder asked if I wanted to give him head to feel better. The bar for men is in hell, yet somehow they keep lowering it", "I\u2019m feeling like the way you see sex is almost misandrist. If I\u2019m in a bad mood, I want to talk through my feelings with my husband. Express what\u2019s bothering me, get to the root of the issue if I haven\u2019t already identified it, and come up with some solutions. If he just yanked my pants down and started eating me out while I\u2019m clearly upset, I\u2019d be kicking him off of me and leaving for the night. \n\nMen aren\u2019t animals who always want sex, and blowjobs aren\u2019t magic tricks that fix emotional problems.", "YTA 2", "I asked my Gen X mom and boomer dad: their word for a pick-me was a \u201cGo team.\u201d Basically the \u201cI\u2019m not like other girls\u201d type.", "Cause your answers in this comment section honestly make you sound like a guy who barely knows anything about women. Idk who taught you these gender stereotypes but you should maybe try to learn more about why these stereotypes are harmful", "Being should be giving to their partners in all aspects.  Give time, attention, concern, etc. and some women feel they should be treated as a princess but treat their man like a peasant.", "Huh?", "You think I\u2019m a man?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "This literally made me gasp. I\u2019m glad he was arrested. Holy crap.", "Preach!", "Agreed. Seems like a fake troll", "I'm not sure why my comment got down voted so much. Pretty much after 20 years of marriage I have learned that a lot of the time, when hes stressed or frustrated or in a bad mood, a blow job helps. He appreciates it and for my part I dont mind doing that for him at those times. Thats not to say all my marital problems are fixed this way, or we dont have issues that cant be fixed that way. I have found it to be helpful for small things though. While your comment was tone deaf and made me think maybe you aren't married, or haven't been married for long if you are, its not a hugely outlandish thought that that could help, because in many ways I have found it does help my husband.", "Can you read a short sentence? If you can it is pretty clear what I am saying. Research clearly shows how men like you will sexually harass women to get your jollies and claim it was 'conversation'. Read all about it, you can access most of the research from Google Scholar.", "I don't have to make it up since it's right there in the story. The wives are clearly unhappy with their treatment because their husbands are in a bad mood. And OP very much suggested placating them with a blow job. I'm not sure which part is confusing for you.", "Where did I say wildly abusive and disrespectful?", "I\u2019ve never heard that phrase used to mean vaginal bleeding at all.", "I totally get this. And it\u2019s smart. I have a follow up question for you.", "Your comment described wildly abusive and disrespectful behavior. \n\nIs that really hard for you to connect?", "Are you saying the husbands are obligated to be in a good mood and happy all the time or they are bad husbands and mean people? This sounds a lot like they should just \"suck it up\" and \" be a man\" which I understand is a form of toxic masculinity that people are supposed to be against. People of either gender are allowed to be stressed and upset if they are having a difficult time.", "No, it did not. You can treat someone shitty without it being wildly abusive. These women are clearly unhappy with how they're being treated lately. This needs to be super fucking clear: women are NOT obligated to perform sexual favors for anyone making them unhappy.", "I love that I got downvoted for that statement lol."]}
