Husbands being uptight because they aren't sexually satisfied is an old stereotype that ignores at least one other side: that often, women aren't as interested in sex because of all the other things that they have to do. There are also other considerations that may be specific to these women. Does what you're saying affirm their experience or dismiss it?\n3. Moment.

If anything, it\u2019s a bit misandrist to suggest that such a complex problem could have such an easy solution. \n\nI believe that in a marriage, a person\u2019s duty should be to their partner and sensing what he/she/x needs. If your dude needs a bj, give him a bj! If your lady needs some flowers and cuddles or to be gone down on, you do those things!

Absolutely not. \n\nYou touched a nerve and made them self-reflect, if even for a fraction of a second, that they are not upholding their end of a happy marriage and that is why they are giving you the cold shoulder. Yes, they feel dismissed and you were a bit flippant about your remark, but your words touched on an issue that may be a reoccurring theme in their marriages. Was their uptight reaction because of their husbands\u2019 moods or are the husbands\u2019 moods uptight because of them? Who knows? But people seriously need to lighten the fuck up. There\u2019s too much going on in the world to be this thin-skinned.  However, if you like having them as friends, you should apologize. If you can do without them, you should at least explain your piece and move forward and find friends more suited to your humor. \n\nCould there be more to this story that you\u2019re not telling us or don\u2019t know to be telling us and that you are in fact the AH in this situation? Sure. \nIs it a woman\u2019s duty to keep a man happy? Hell no. That would be misogynistic. Is it a husband/wife\u2019s duty to keep their partner happy to the best of their ability? 100%.\n\nEdit: after reading a lot of the downvoted comments, I realize I havent even thought of the immaturity and passive aggressiveness of the cold shoulder treatment.

Everyone's LOVE language is different, maybe they don't realize that touch is an important love language. If you're spouse is having a tough day and you haven't even sat next to them, held hands or even just kiss them, they could be feeling like they don't matter. It could make them withdraw if they feel unwanted when already stressed. My spouse and I share the same major two love languages touch and service, we are affectionate and do things for each other. Honestly from what little information is here sounds like it's a complete lack of communication in their marriage as they'd rather talk about the problem with friends then communicate with their spouse. Just because he's a man doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings, people including men aren't cold and distant for no reason. TBH the majority of the responses on here are why men have a higher suicide rate and are just toxic. From the information given and what's in your comments, they make the same kind of jokes. This time they got offended and in those types of situations it's usually because the joke hit too close. Why I think it should have been followed with real conversation.  I bet if they actually had solid real communication with their husbands they probably find that their husbands feel like they do. It's easy to feel like you are doing everything by yourself and the other person is distant if you don't engage in  meaningful conversation. ESH.", "I think YTA in their eyes for sure. I get you were trying to keep it light and funny.
