{"id": 31627, "submission_id": "182sasw", "title": "AITA for agreeing to walk my step daughter down the isle but not bio daughter?", "selftext": "On my graduation party, I hooked up with May and got her pregnant. She was dating her long term partner at the time and told neither of us that the baby was mine. I didn't know she had a bf or that she was pregnant.\n\nAfter college, I returned to my hometown and met my childhood friend Anna. She was pregnant and her partner had died one month before her baby was due in a bad car accident. \n\nShe had a girl, Ella and I was there for the birth. Back then I was there just as a friend but I loved that baby as a father. As soon as she was placed in my arms, I became her father. Anna and I didn't get together until Ella was 5 but even before, Ella called me dad. I was always her father and I still love her beyond anything. \n\nShe's now 21 and getting married in December. I was asked to walk her down the isle and I said yes. \n\nOver 2 years ago, a girl named Sophie reached out to me telling me I was her father. After some enquiry, I found out May had lied to her bf, Max and for the last 18 years, he had been raising Sophie thinking she was his. He found out and ended everything with both May and Sophie. May begged and pleaded but he wanted nothing to do with them. \n\nI felt horrible for the Sophie and after discussing, Anna and I agreed to help out with her living arrangements and college. We never really connected as parent/child since Sophie said she wanted to try reconciling with her dad. I agreed and thought him not having to pay for her might make it easy for the man to see past the bitterness. \n\nI didn't hear much from Sophie unless she needed money. She was always distant, often snapping at me whenever I tried to get to know her because 'I had never bothered to search if I had any kids' and 'If I wasn't there, she'd have been her real dad's real kid'. I tried not to let any of it bother because I cannot comprehend her pain. \n\nRecently, Sophie too got engaged to her long time partner. The wedding's in December, on the same day as Ella's and neither can change this late. I didn't know she was even engaged until a week ago. She said she wanted me to walk her down the isle. I said I was grateful she considered me (she immediately corrected me saying she only asked cause Max refused.) But that I couldn't do it since I had already given Ella my word. \n\nSophie got upset, standing up and crying and screaming at me. Calling me a deadbeat and cheater. All kinds of horrible names for ruining her life and now her wedding. I apologized but still refused. She left and I have since recieved backlash for both her friends and fiance. They say it's the least I can do for my 'bio' kid.\n\nBut Sophie really never became my daughter. She's just some kid I've tried to help in whichever way she'd accept while she tried to work with her actual dad. Ella is my daughter in every way imaginable. I sympathize with Sophie but I have made up my mind to be there for Ella. I won't change that. \n\nBut I still have to ask, AITA?\n\nEdited to add: 1. grammar corrections. \n\n2. My thoughts, I cannot be a comparison for Max. I knowingly chose to love and raise a child I knew wasn't biologically mine. I got to love Ella as a whole person, watch her grow and learn everything about her and choose the responsibility of raising her. \n \nMax did not. He wasn't aware of the truth. He didn't get to choose. He was told he had a responsibility and he worked hard to rise to the occasion and then learned years later that he had been lied to. \n\nAnna wasn't my girlfriend. Anna didn't lie to or force me. May was Max's girlfriend. She lied to and betrayed him. It's NOT the same and having seen what the betrayal did to him, I cannot place any blame onto him. Yes, he's the adult but he's also a human. Please, don't use me as a comparison for Max. I couldn't explain the difference to Sophie but hopefully reddit is more understanding.

You were just as much a victim in this situation as she was. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who thought that both weddings being on the same day is suspicious. It would be interesting to see when Sophie\u2019s wedding was booked and if she knew about Ella\u2019s wedding. Has she ever shown any jealousy towards Ella before?", "NTA\n\nEven if you had managed to have a relationship with her you already have a commitment to your other daughter, step or not.\n\nIn these circumstances I would actually say you weren't the AH even if you just didn't want to.

If she doesn't want you as a father then she shouldn't even ask.", "Nta\n\nNo one should expect you to walk a woman down the aisle when you don't have a relationship with her, especially when she only asked because Max said no. I wouldn't walk her down either. \n\nSide note, I find it odd that these wedding happened to be on the same day. I get it may be a coincidence but man... Kinda feels like she is testing you even though she has never shown kindness to you.\n\nBut I do feel bad for her though. Her mother cheated on her partner and then lied to him. Made him raise a kid that she knew may not be his. Then she lied to her daughter for 18 years. Trauma city. Then the man who she thought was her father for 18 years abandoned her. Sophie, I think just guessing, goes to you hoping to feel something but she doesn't. She isn't right to treat you as she did. She will always be wrong for that. I just see her desperate for a father's love.... A father's love from Max and he won't give it.  She is resentful of you (for the wrong reasons). May screwed her daughter's life up.", "NTA...Family is more than blood relations. You've done all that you can do to help someone you've never had a relationship with.  You've never been second best in Ella's life.  Just go with what feels right and don't second guess yourself.", "NTA. Damn. May sucks but Max sucks even more for raising a child for 18 years and discarding her like trash because of her mother's lie.

She needs professional help.", "Nta  Sophie getting mad you never searched is not ok", "NTA\n\nYou've done far more for Sophie than many in your shoes would have.  Sophie's Mom is a piece of work.  She is the one who kept her dirty little secret and forced Mark into a parental role he didn't have to be in.  Sophie is angry at the wrong person here.  All you, and by extension Anna have done is be a living ATM for her apparently.  \n\nAnd now you're Sophie's second choice?  (Sorry for the horrible pun).  You have a daughter who you've loved and known since the day she was born.  One who has always known you as Dad, and who appreciates you.

If she isn\u2019t already seeing a therapist/counsellor, is that something you could support her with?", "NTA. You have no relationship with Sophie. She only contacts you if she wants something.

But whether intentional or not, she\u2019s trying to guilt you into stepping up only when her real dad says no. He\u2019s the asshole. Sperm doesn\u2019t make you a father, how you love and treat a child makes you a father (you seem to get that very well BTW, and Ella is lucky to have you as her father). I can understand him flipping on his ex and writing her off, but it\u2019s preposterous that he can turn his back on an 18 year old he supposedly loved for her whole life.

I could understand that as a knee-jerk reaction he was sorry for an hour later, but I cannot understand that he just cuts her off like that.\n\nFor you, OP: never underestimate the power of blood.\n\nSophie might be nothing to *you* personally, or if *you* look at it rationally, but get the fuck over yourself and do your best to lessen Sophie's pain and suffering caused by *your absence,* even if that was unintentional because you never even knew she existed.

Her mom is the liar and the cheat and it\u2019s her mom who has ruined her life not anyone else. All of this falls on her and her alone. She can be mad at max for walking out on her after raising her but the poor guy just found out he was duped into raising someone else\u2019s kid cause his gf was cheater and a liar so he gets a little leeway on this. Your daughter however is clearly not a good person. She only comes to you when she wants to demand something and if you don\u2019t jump to it she brings out the accusations and verbal abuse. Cut your losses here and cut her out of your life.", "NTA.\n\nHave you and Sophie done a DNA test?

No wonder he\u2019s cracked up in the face of that. I might hate the fact that he\u2019s walked away from Sophie, because it\u2019s not her fault and that\u2019s still his kid in every way that matters, but I do understand and feel terribly for him. There can be no comparison between your situations, you are right about that. \n\nYou haven\u2019t said it, but as well as Sophie lashing out and wrongly blaming you, and happily taking your money with one hand while pushing you away with the other, you\u2019ve also just found out that you were robbed of your daughter\u2019s entire childhood. You didn\u2019t abandon her - that was stolen from you. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine the pain Sophie must be in. My heart breaks for her. But taking it out on you and constantly putting you down isn\u2019t going to make her feel any less alone. She needs a hell of a lot of therapy. Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. I really hope Sophie and Max are able to piece together the fragments of their relationship in the future. \n\nYou can\u2019t just abandon Ella on her wedding day - you are her dad and you\u2019re doing the right thing walking her down the aisle. The whole situation is beyond awful though, and as much as Sophie\u2019s mum is entirely to blame for everyone suffering like they are, someone does need to attempt a welfare check if no one knows how or where she is.

I understand that her life has been turned upside down from one day to the next but she is taking it out on the wrong person, you are not to blame for anything, neither from her mother's lie nor her father's reaction, she cannot expect you to provide for her financially and treat you as if you had abandoned her, that just shows how much of an entitled brat she is. She should be grateful that you helped her because even though you have a biological relationship, it does not mean that it is your responsibility, but rather that of the person who gave her her last name and raised her.because she herself has made it clear that she doesn't see you as a father, so she was only interested in money and that's wrong.\nAnd again, I understand that her world fell apart overnight, but that does not justify how she has treated you, she's a grown woman who should know better than that, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nPlus, she made it clear herself, she only asked you because Max refused,  does she think you're her replacement toy? Does she thinks you're nothing more than a second option? No, you are and deserve more than that because you have been nothing but good to her without having the responsibility, because you did not even know of her existence. So no OP YNTA, Sophie is not your daughter Ella is and your duty as a father is to your daughter, not to the entitled brat who cannot even be mature enough to give you something as basic as respect, and that you shouldn't even be getting married if she don't have the maturity \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Blood does not a daughter make. \n\nJust as blood does not a father make. \n\nGood on you for supporting your step daughter though. \n\nYour bio daughter has some hangups that she's taking out on you.

The asshole here is the guy who walked out on the child he raised for 18 years because he was mad at her mom for lying to him. As you have demonstrated, it doesn't necessarily take blood to make someone a father. It seems you have just become the receptacle for all of her pain since Max isn't there to take it. \n\nI sympathize with her greatly as this must be very emotionally complicated for her, but if you've raised a child you've always considered your own despite blood and have prior commitments to that child, it is unfortunate for Sophie but not your fault.", "Dude, you're an adult. Sophie is having a temper tantrum, and pulling all her immature friends along in her temper tantrum. You already know which wedding you'll be there for, and you already know you're being reasonable.

Yeah what happened was shitty, but she really expected you to choose her over the girl you raised? Especially after snapping at you and pushing you away?", "NTA. Sophie has misplaced her anger. Her mother is the one who lied and cheated, and created this situation. She doesn't want you as a father, she wants you as a scapegoat and a source of support on demand. The fact that you didn't even know she was engaged, and that she told you that you are only a replacement for the father than abandoned her shows that you don't have a close enough relationship for her to expect this from you.

I hope he can figure that out and reconnect with Sophie and hopefully all of you can get along one day in whatever that looks like for you since you all have the fact that May betrayed you in common. I know youll be open to that if its ever presented. Just keep doing what youre doing be there when she needs you but also move forward with your life in case she doesnt ever get over this.

Enjoy your day with Ella.", "NTA, but from what you said in your original post, I don't think you really tried to help her beyond what you felt were average/minimum. You believe Sophie is \"some kid\" and a stranger. So does that mean you believe Ella is your REAL daughter and Sophie is your fake daughter? My guess is you've intentionally kept yourself separate from her all this time and just handed out money to the biokid you'd prefer to keep as a stranger so it doesn't make you feel like it would take time or attention or love away from your \"real\" daughter. Yeah, so at 18 it's hard to connect. And from what you said that Sophie shouted (\"deadbeat\", \"cheater\") as she ran away, it sounds like Sophie's mother has laid all the blame on you for you not being involved. FYI, throwing money around isn't the final definition of being involved. Emotions are necessary too. But you don't seem to particularly care about having an emotional father daughter relationship with Sophie. Let me rephrase: you don't seem incentivized to do anything except throw money at the problem. Emotional connection? It's like your answer is nah, you have Ella. Meanwhile there's a woman out there (Sophie) who lost two fathers, one before she was old enough to do or even know anything about it, and one she had all her life. On top of that Sophie was probably told by May that her newly revealed father (you) is someone who... dun dun dun... doesn't care and won't be emotionally available (hence the comments like deadbeat; and her attempt to keep herself emotionally unavailable to be disappointed by you - via preferencing her other father in conversations with you - while trying to hold on to her other father's love that he chose to stop giving her for something that is not her fault and is beyond her control). And whoever knows what else. In this situation of walking your daughters -- excuse me, in your words, walking your daughter also some kid down the aisle, you are NTA for choosing your daughter. But you don't really sound like you want to be a father or a dad to Sophie, and you don't really sound like you want to draw a line in the sand either. Well, I'm gonna break it to you. You either need to have a father daughter relationship with your biodaughter or tell her you don't want to have a relationship with her. Either you're willing to have two daughters in your heart and make the effort for Ella to be equal to Sophie, or you're not willing to be a father to both of them. You're NTA for walk-in Ella down the aisle, but you clearly didn't ask if you're the a-h when it comes to your relationship with Sophie. You're right. You don't know Sophie's pain. But you're throwing money at it and saying that should be enough. What an insult. Although both of them having their weddings on the same day is weird. You're still NTA for walking down your daughter Ella. But if Sophie is just some other kid to you and you don't intend to change that, then you should be honest with her. I'm not going to tell you that you could have room in your heart for both of them, because I don't know if you're that capable or if you even desire being able to be a father to both of them. But at least make it unarguably clear to Sophie whether she'll ever be your daughter too, or if she'll only ever be your biokid from a woman you dislike.", "NTA because the weddings are on the same day.  If they were different days I'd say maybe do her a solid and walk her down the aisle so she won't be embarrassed. \n\nBut they are the same day and one of them wants you there and has grown up with you in a dad role.  You're runner up for the other who doesn't know you.  \n\nHopefully max will come through.", "NTA.  While I sympathize with Sophie, whose whole life has been upended in the cruelest possible way, she doesn\u2019t get to demand that you abandon Anna on her wedding day just because Max abandoned her.  She\u2019s jealous that Anna has the relationship with you that Sophie wants with Max.  Sophie needs therapy, and to understand that her needs are not important just because she wants them to be, or even *needs* them to be, especially given how she\u2019s treated you in the short time you\u2019ve known her.", "NTA. After reading l your edit as well it\u2019s clear you are a very thoughtful and kind person. \n\nSorry for the situation you are in.", "NTA. \n\nSophie was raised by a woman who uses men for what she wants. Now She\u2019s trying to use both you and Max to get what she wants. \n\nElla was raised by a woman who worked at developing healthy relationships. Now she has a healthy relationship with her dad. \n\nThat Sophie\u2019s wedding is on the exact same day as Ella\u2019s already scheduled wedding just seems to much of a coincidence.", "NTA. But walking out on a PERSON you raised for 18 years does make Max one of the assholes in this situation. Totally understandable to ditch the one who lied to you, but it isn\u2019t Sophie\u2019s fault. Stop excusing child abandonment because the child\u2019s mother was an asshole.

You are 100% right that you should not walk Sophie down down the aisle. Not even because she had been so horrible since you two connected. You are walking Ella down the aisle and that how it should be. She is your daughter. I would think it would be very uncomfortable to walk Sophie down the aisle. I would think an uncle or cousin would be better off walking her down the aisle.", "NTA, Sophie is a relatively new and distant addition to your life, and you committed to Ella to walk down the aisle with her.  If it is that important to Sophie she can change the date of her wedding.", "NTA.  I'm saying this for a few reasons:\n\n1)  You committed to walk Ella down the aisle when you knew of her wedding day.  Even if Ella and Sophie were full sisters and you had been in their lives from day 1, I would say your commitment to Ella would take precedence because you made it before Sophie approached you.  \n\n2)  As you rightly pointed out, you have a father-daughter relationship with Ella.  You do not have that relationship with Sophie.  Ella has asked you to walk her down the aisle because she sees you as her father.  Sophie has requested this of you because the wedding manual says there is supposed to be a father to walk her down the aisle, and you are the second-string dad.  \n\n3)  Ella has been gracious toward you.  Sophie has not.  When two people want favors from you in the same place at the same time, there is nothing wrong with going with the person who is gracious rather than rude.", "[removed]", "NTA in so so SO many ways! You were only told a week ago, about Sophie\u2019s wedding. You are having a prior engagement that is as important (Id say more important) and as we all know, you should always keep your end of the deal. You can\u2019t back out of Ella\u2019s wedding just to please Sophie. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re her bio dad and that\u2019s for so many reasons. You weren\u2019t first pick. She only wants to deal with you, when there\u2019s something in it for her. She won\u2019t let you try to get to know her and then berates you afterwards for not being there for her and what not! Yes she needs some therapy as it must be very tough being rejected by the man you\u2019ve considered your father for your whole life. But this is to no fault of yours. \nEnjoy walking Ella down the aisle. \nSophie could do with some gratitude towards you!", "NTA. You are not a deadbeat dad since you did not know you fathered a child with a one night stand. May had the responsibility to be honest with the BF she cheated on. She is hurt but she is lashing out at the wrong person - if she should be angry with anyone it should be her Mom who created all this drama with her lies. Max has the right to be hurt but he is also blaming the wrong person - how can he turn off the feelings for his \"daughter\" like a switch? He can be pissed at May but should at least be kind to Sophie. Sophie can't pick and choose when she wants you involved in her life as a punishment to you. You didn't even know Sophie was engaged and all these people think you are the bad guy? WTH. Walk Ella down the aisle and be the proud Dad.", "Aisle", "Nta I think unless Sophie wants an emotional relationship with you, you need to cut her off, she wants to use you as a punching bag for being let down by the man she thought was her father. Don\u2019t sign up for the abuse because her mother lied.", "NTA. This is a complicated and delicate situation all around and honestly I think your dealing with it all very well. Over time Sophie might come around more, but she also might not. Eventually you'll probably have to decide if you want to keep putting in the financial and emotional effort into that relationship or not and I don't think either would be the wrong choice. As of right now I think alot of people are hurt and angry and since May ran off they don't have anyone to blame and direct their anger at, so your getting the short end of the stick. I think going to Ella's wedding over Sophie's is the right and only move you could make her. In everyday that matters you are her dad. Maybe after Sophie cooled off a bit you could try talking more about why your going to Ella's wedding. Sophie obviously wants her dad back so she understands that sometimes other familiar bonds are stronger than blood bonds.", "NTA by your question, but this story is so much bullshit you could raise enough crops to feed all of humanity. May caught the golden BB, you tumble into a relationship where the bio father just died, and the biggest one is they happen to get married the same weekend.\n\nReally bog-standarf story about blood vs heart relationships - but the bullshit meter is off the charts.", "NTA.\n\nIf there was a practical way to do both, I'd suggest that you try to.  But there isn't, and regardless of anything else, you already agreed to do the one.  You can't back out of the one to do the other.  If they were both getting married in the same hotel or whatever, and you could go back and forth, then great.  If it wasn't the same day, then great.\n\nBut as it is, you can't.

And I\u2019d bet money her mom has twisted the story somehow to make you seem somehow at fault or like you abandoned them.", "NTA\n\nThis is a really shitty situation that you have been dumped into.  The big question is, how did both of the kids manage to have their weddings on the same exact day?  Did Sophie know that Ella was getting married on that particular day?  It honestly sounds like Sophie is actually jealous that you consider Ella to be your daughter rather than her so she planned her wedding to be on the same day to \"make you choose\" without realising that you have been a father to Ella her whole life while you didn't even know that Sophie existed until 2 years ago.\n\nIn other words, Sophie needs to go talk to a professional about this whole situation.  Someone who can help her organise her feelings and emotions and help her develop coping strategies for it all.\n\n>Sophie got upset, standing up and crying and screaming at me.

It has only been the past decade or so that mass genetic testing has been affordable due to increased competition and advancing technology.  \n\nThe big elephant in the room is the question as to whether you are actually Sophie's biological dad.  Is everyone just taking May's word for it or has there actually been genetic testing done?", "NTA the entire blame for this shit show is on Sophie's mom.

Not saying her anger is healthy, or in Max's case, fair (it sounds like he's suffering a period of profound mental illness and it sucks to get sick in any way and have to pull back from being a caregiver to your family members who need you because you're trying to survive. Ask me how I know!) but it's very understandable to me that she's feeling helpless and rejected and is trying to get back a sense of control by transmuting that to anger at someone causally responsible for the current circumstances (though in no way to blame, tbc).

Two psychiatric hospitalizations is a major thing. Most people go their whole life without a single one, even people with diagnosed mental illnesses from youth. To have two in two years is indicative of something serious. You don\u2019t get hospitalized because you need a vacation, you have to be actively psychotic or a danger to yourself or others.

It doesn\u2019t make sense to those not actively in the same mental space, it just hurts endlessly. What they see as immense love and a protective instinct is just painful rejection to everyone else. He probably feels the same way Sophie does, and he\u2019s willing to hurt worse because he thinks he\u2019s protecting her. Sacrificing his own heart to ultimately save hers. \n\nThe truth is, in that mindset, you can logically understand what people are saying about others feeling rejected, and you want to spare them that pain too, but your mind, body, soul and heart are all telling you that it will hurt them *less* if you just push them away and that eventually they will understand that. \n\nIt\u2019s a twisted thinking that is hard to understand for those of us that have never gone through it.
