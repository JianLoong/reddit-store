Seemingly for life. \n\nIt does seem that way, yeah", "NTA Find separate living arrangements asap. The longer she stays the harder it will be for you to move on with your lives. \n\nShe may want to look into elderly / disabled housing options. \n\nIt was never your job to live with her forever. It's happiness in your life & marriage that should be your top priority.\n\nI doubt your wife will agree to this living arrangement until your mom dies. Choose you and your wife.", "NTA. You can\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep your mother warm. It sounds like you have always been your mother\u2019s retirement plan. How long  have you lived together?", "NTA - but your Mom is going to be hard to get away from.  She enjoys being taken care of and having less financial responsibility with you two footing part of the bills.\n\nLook into local senior housing and see what is available, also get her involved in the local Seniors groups where they have activities.  Then go from there, and you may have to draw a hard line with your mom to get some independence.", "There\u2019s no conflict yet - you just need to have an honest and frank conversation with your mother.", "INFO. Have you had a straightforward conversation with her about each of your expectations moving forward?  Have you tried expressing that you are okay with her staying with you while she figures everything out but don't want her to stay forever?", "There are senior living apartments that are income based.  She needs to get on a waiting list asap.  Depending on her health she may also qualify for home health assistance, meals on wheels, senior transportation.  It just requires her to do the paperwork (and she won\u2019t unless you make her). Trust me I know\u2026I got my breaking point and told my husband and to choose.", "NTA just leave. You are not her hostave", "NTA, and you are going to have to be firmer with your mother, since she obviously thinks there is a chance she can guilt you into taking her with you. Don't do it. Most relationships are not strong enough for an extra burden like that. If your mother can't live alone, she must look into some kind of assisted living. Children are not responsible for their parents' happiness and wellbeing. You can help her get situated somewhere, but not with you!", "You lived with your mom because you were broke, and she wants to live with you because she is broke.\n\nNAH", "NTA.\n\nYou can still support your mom without housing her. Talk to her about it, be honest with her. Figure out the money situations and what her realistic options are. You're a phone call away if she needs you. But establish that distance", "NAH. You expected her to help when you needed it, now you are mad because she's in the same difficult spot financially? Come on.\n\nHelp her find a place she can afford while you're making your own plans. This can be a win-win if you make it so.", "So you both will need to move out and do not let ur mom sleep over or she will move in... do it now because no matter how much you tell her or set her up, she wants to live with you...don't give her a key either", "NTA. But you need to split living arrangements now. Either look into affordable housing for your mom - a lot of the senior affordable housing apartment communities will only charge 1/3 of her monthly income for rent - or look into assisted living now with her combined health insurance and income. If you don\u2019t do it now, mommy dearest will assume she is living with you forever.", "Nta", "Set a deadline. Find a place. Don't tell your mom where you'll be moving. Due to the guilt trips already happening and the fact that you will probably want to make sure she won't come around creating drama. Come back and visit like most families do. If you wait for her to feel like she'll make it. You & your wife never will as a family because you won't get your start.", "NTA, your mother is the AH! Don't give in, she'll never leave and never let you have your own lives.", "NTA  you might need to set your mother up somewhere since she's not going to do it. Your other option is to give her a firm time frame and stick to it", "NTA but unless you set some real boundaries with your mother you'll continue to poison your marriage and all your future relationships. Decide which is more important: placating your mother who clearly guilt trips and is selfish, or your wife. You can't keep both happy.\n\nHere's a hint: don't pick your mother. It's a parents job to raise and take care of their children, not the other way around.", "NAH\n\nI understand you wanting to start an independent life with your wife, but I also understand the fear your mom has of staying alone. A lot of ppl here will probably disagree with me, seeing the direction of the replies, but I believe we should take care of our parents in their old age after everything they gave and did for us throughout our lives. Leaving your mom alone while she's suffering from health issues and barely has any income isn't the greatest move imo. \n\nWhat if you help her move into an assisted living facility? somewhere nice where she'll meet other ppl her age and have some social life? Social security will pay for some and you can add a bit so she can live in a nice place.  \nAnother option is getting a place with a side unit attached so she can live next to you but not actually in the same house, so you'll have privacy (that's actually my plan if any of my or my partner's parents will need our help).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell your mom she has x amount of months to get her poop together and move out. Help her with resources (senior programs, etc) if she needs it. Let her know how you'll still be in her life after she's moved out, but she ***is*** going to move out.", "NTA You don't belong to your mother. You only get one life to live - don't sacrifice it for her.", "This sounds like some monster manipulative bullshit is what it is.", "4 years ago is when our financial strain was bad that there was no other choice but to move in my mom. This was supposed to be a temporary arrangement. Now that we are voicing that we want to be on our own she's freaking out that she won't be able to make it and that she may end up in the streets. I know these days social security isn't much, but I can't help but feel she may be exaggerating.", "We have had this conversation with her at least three times within a year. It comes off as understanding at first, then quickly turns to a series of what ifs and reasons she won't be okay on her own. While some of these reasons seem valid, they can be worked on. Then as said conversation continues, eventually we're guilted to just dropping the conversation and don't try to bring it up anymore.", "What was she doing before you moved in? I know inflation has changed things in the last 4 years, but still.. she did it before I assume and can do it again. \nShe may need to adjust her lifestyle a bit. \nIf/when she lives alone, maybe she would qualify for some programs that would help her financially. Maybe she'd qualify for housing based on income. If she doesn't want to live alone, maybe living in elderly housing would be nice for her so she at least has somewhat of a community with neighbors.", "She\u2019s absolutely exaggerating. If she\u2019s already on social security she has other options. Consider what will happen if her health deteriorates further. Your wife is a right. Don\u2019t let your mom guilt you. If your mother was able to pay her bills before you moved in she\u2019ll find a way to manage going forward. Can you set a deadline and move out? I would advise against having her move in with you. She\u2019ll keep postponing finding her own place.", "Then you need to change the conversation. Let her know that you will be moving on and she needs to figure out her situation. Either way it won\u2019t change the fact that you\u2019re moving on.", "NTA.  You do need to clearly define what you want and just keep telling her, then, you can't just start avoiding the conversation.  Set the boundary.  For example, \"Mom we are happy with you living with us for [insert time period], but then we need you find your own place.\"  Let her know you care so that she doesn't feel abandoned.  Let her know specifically what you're willing to do to help her figure out what to do even.  When she starts making excuses, it sounds like she's sharing the reasons that she's scared.  Remind her that she will be okay.  You can be firm but supportive through this.", "NTA. When she starts the \"what if's,\" stop her and say, \"We're moving. You got by without us before, you can  do it again.\" This is not a discussion about IF you're moving out, this is her notice that you ARE moving out. She doesn't get a say in this. You're an adult, the only people who get to decide your living arrangements are you and your wife, and wanting to live on your own, without your mother, and start a family is NATURAL and NORMAL.", "She lived on her own once already. 2nd floor no less which is usually a worry for her medical condition but she made it work otherwise. Financially she made it work as well. So right now I can't help but feel it's fear that's driving her to act out like she is.", "It sounds like it\u2019s time for her to relocate. Perhaps she can find a studio apartment without stairs that is near to where you live. Swinging by to check in on her a couple of times per week to help with minor tasks would be a good middle ground where you can help a bit without giving up your life for hers. If that\u2019s not feasible, some sort of senior housing or assisted living might be useful to consider.", "Maybe fear, and also doesn't want to be lonely. \nShe may have handled living alone just fine, but perhaps just really liked having someone living with her for the social aspect. \nYou are talking about living potentially far away - so it's not like you'd see her all the time I imagine? \nAlso, probably thinking about as she gets older and may potentially have more problems. \nI work with homebound veterans, some may be fine living alone when they join the program but things can quickly change. Many struggle accepting that it's unsafe to live alone, but it sounds like your Mom is opposite - where she is worried about it before it even happens.", "Is she old enough for a retirement community? There are some nice, affordable ones....I know they often have a bad rep but that's not always the case. Most cities have several, and maybe you can find one near your home? \n\nBut yeah, she can't stay with you forever and she's being a bit manipulative right now.", "Yeah, it sounds like she's just exaggerating to manipulate you.", "Would she be open to having a roommate? Someone that would get a discount on rent to sort of help her out once in a while? She would get a little extra money and help, the roommate gets a discount in exchange for some general assistance. (Light cleaning or whatever) And you and your wife get your lives back.", "She just turned 55 a couple months ago. Not sure what is available as far as that age to be honest. I would assume not much.", "Oh, yeah, that's not that old all things considered! I thought she might be like 60ish....I think the usual age is 62-65 for those places.", "I\u2019m not sure where you live but there are many senior apartments and communities in my area that are for ages 55 and up. If you want one of the levels of care communities (independent living, rehab, assisted living, memory care, skilled nursing care, and hospice) those are usually for 62 and up. I\u2019m 58 to your mother\u2019s 55 and I have some significant mobility issues. I\u2019ve had to make some modifications to my routine but I don\u2019t expect my children to give up their future for me.", "came here to say this!"]}
