My sister, aunt and mother in law offered to help me plan my baby shower, and I took them up on their offer. \n\nAfter a few days my sister texted me that she was furious she wasn\u2019t planning the shower alone and how basically she hated all of my ideas. \n\u201cAs the mom you shouldn\u2019t be helping\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you inviting men?\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we throw it at my house\u201d\nAll of it turned into a big fuss because supposedly I\u2019m simply doing all of this because I hate her. At the time that\u2019s not really how I felt. Other people offered to help so I said that was okay I didn\u2019t see the big deal. It\u2019s a family event to celebrate a new member. But I guess in my sisters eyes it was her day to shine. \n\nAnyway, the baby shower ended up not happening as my baby passed away right after we sent out the invites. At that point, my sister only texted me twice and I never heard from her again. She didn\u2019t come to see me, no phone calls, no texts, nothing. She didn\u2019t even ask how I was just asked in her one text if there would be a funeral. A month later was her birthday. Still messaged her to wish her a happy birthday, no reply. I don\u2019t hear from her for six months\n\nBy that point I said I was done with her. This kind of behavior is not a one time thing and I decided I didn\u2019t need this in my life anymore didn\u2019t matter that she was family. \n\nI became pregnant again with our son, and my family kept badgering me to make amends with my sister. I told them no, to please stay out of it and respect my wishes. Of course she finds out and is furious I never told her I was pregnant again. I don\u2019t care because we no longer have a relationship. But she is still mad about my previous child\u2019s baby shower and that I deeply hurt her feelings and \u201ceveryone agrees that as she was my sister she should have been the sole planner\u201d. It\u2019s BS I know no one else really cared. \n\nMy family still thinks it\u2019s a shame she hasn\u2019t met her nephew but I feel like she made her choice to behave the way she does and now has to deal with the consequences.\n\nSo, AITA for not letting her plan the shower?\nAITA for deciding I don\u2019t need a narcissistic liar in my life?\nAITA for not letting her meet my son?\n\nEdit: okay so when I say I \u201chelped\u201d plan my own baby shower, i didn\u2019t really do much. I just said I wanted a brunch theme as the time was more convenient for guests, I wanted to invite male family members and friends, and I wanted to help bake some things cause I love to bake.

She gets news and is furious at you for whatever reason. Having a rainbow baby is stressful enough without that kind of negativity around. \nCongratulations on your son.", "NTA.  You lost a child and all your family seems to care about is smoothing over your sister's hurt feelings over a shower that didn't happen.  This is totally jacked up.  First your sister sounds like she need therapy.  Her reaction over planning a baby shower is just over the top.  She offered nothing to you when you lost your child!  No support, no shoulder to cry on, NOTHING. You owe her NOTHING.  And she has the nerve to be pissed that you didn't go running to her when pregnant again?  Oh hell no.", "nta she's an awful sister", "NTA \n\nYour sister is self-centered and lacking in empathy. You are the one who was attacked by her and then ignored in the aftermath of a horrible loss. She killed the relationship all on her own. \n\nYou also had the perfect level of involvement with the first shower, those details are what the guest of honor should be involved in.", "Planning your own shower is unusual and kind of tacky, at least in the US - but that is petty nonsense.  You did nothing wrong and your sister had no right to play victim.  That she was so very absent when you lost a child, and is still mad about the baby shower even after that, is just ridiculously narcissistic.  You owe her nothing.\n\nNTA, and I am very sorry for your loss.", "NTA. There is no rule that your sister has to plan your shower alone. It's YOUR shower so YOUR input should be welcome. Besides all that, she made a choice with her behavior and you are simply abiding by her choice.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \n\nBut it\u2019s pretty uncommon, at least from all the baby showers I\u2019ve been apart of, for the mom to help plan and organize it aside from a guest list. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t call your sister a narcissist but she is pretty selfish for not talking to you over a baby shower. \n\nNTA - but maybe try mending the bridge with your sister.", "Nta", "NTA I was raised in more of an old school way. No baby shower until after the birth. For a Mom like you doing them before can be heartbreaking. You sis is definitely the AH.", "Good God.  Your sister is a piece of work. This was never about you.  This was about stroking her own massive ego.\n\nI'm so sorry about your baby and I'm so happy for your new son.  NTA, and if anyone continues to fuss go LC with them too.", "NTA - she sounds narcissistic and toxic. Good job cutting that out.", "NTA. Please don\u2019t invite her back into your life, and certainly don\u2019t let her selfish, self-centred ass anywhere near your baby. \n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy. I\u2019ll be praying for things to go smoothly for you, OP.", "NTA. First off im sorry for your loss. Second. Congrats on ur new bundle. And third. Keep her out until or if she accepts shes an AH and not entitled to anything in regards to your new family. Family isnt always blood. Sometimes its the people we choose to share our lives with.", "NTA. I am very sorry for your loss and delighted at the news that you now have a healthy baby. Good luck! Your sister sounds awful!", "NTA. My sister threw a fit when she offered to plan my shower and I agreed but said my two friends were going to be helping so they could host it. (They live near me). She was so angry. First she was mad at obviously my friends knew about my pregnancy before she did ( told my best friends a week earlier than I did family). Second she didn't want friend help and couldn't understand why I didn't want my shower in my hometown, 2 hrs away.... I guess she finally got over it, because the shower happened and it went well. But what the fuck is with these sisters.. ?", "NTA your sister sounds like a narcissist. I know this sub likes to throw that word around a lot, but I stand by saying that.", "NTA.\n\nMy MIL tried to pull a similar stunt, whining and pouting and tantruming because I had the audacity to be involved in planning my own baby shower. Like you I had ideas about timing, activities, etc. Eventually my mom and I took over and iced her out completely. Day of she still tried to play hostess and it was so cringy. She barely spoke to me. I hope she keeps it up lol.\n\nSounds like your sister wanted the accolades and attention and glory of being the hero hostess and party planner, just like my MIL wanted. Very narcissistic.\n\nYou've got enough to deal with! Focus on your family, real family that cares about you, drop the toxicity without guilt.", "As I said in another post, some family members need to be treated like a cancer when they become too much to bear.  Cut her out of your life, you don't need your sister in your life, she's too controlling.  NTAH.", "This. Where was the family then??? Clearly not telling her she should be being less selfish and support her sister.", "they all need to be dropped", "Congratulations on your healthy rainbow!\n\nNTA and absolutely not, your sister is a massive AH and also, a narcissist, and the family members are her flying monkeys. She didn't want to be there for you when you needed her and only wanted to make use of you to boost her own ego. Please keep her far away from your son as there will be no genuine love and he will live a much happier life without her presence. All the best and I'm sorry for your loss. Please don't back down on this! You will definitely regret it. NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. She was. Your baby shower, you get to help whatever help and have whatever kind of shower you want. My family is the type to have a family celebration, so anyone is invited. Not silly games, either :)", "Right? I read the post and thought it would be about a baby shower. It wasn\u2019t really- it was about OP sibling making it all about them, and being completely unable to let go of an event that never even happened because the child in question passed away. I\u2019m glad OP is finding the strength and right boundaries and it\u2019s got to be tough that her family isn\u2019t supportive.", "No. Blood is not always family. Family are the people in your life who live you truly and will always be there for you. Would you have advised this woman to mend the bridge if this person behaving in this way had been just a neighbour, old classmate, or workmate?"]}
