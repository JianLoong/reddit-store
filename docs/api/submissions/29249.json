I ignored this until she texted me asking about my NIPT results so I told her how I felt and this is how the conversation went...\n\nI told her about how I felt and how she shouldn't have shared the news as it was our announcement to make. I made it known I was not trying to argue but that I was just telling her how I felt. Husband fully supported this, in fact it was in a group chat. Then she responded that she could not be reprimanded because her nephew was going through surgery after an accident and told me to stop. She apologized for upsetting me and that she never does anything to upset anyone.

Though, if she's the type to make another person's pregnancy about her (which is usually the intention behind blabbing that news), it wouldn't be unfathomable that she's making the nephew's surgery about her (or simply using it as an excuse). But I don't think your words were too harsh. You didn't skirt the issue or sugarcoat it but you weren't unreasonable, you were clear and to the point.\n\nUltimately, the real consequences for her are yet to be seen. She's broken your trust. Personally, I would exclude her from any and all present and future baby-related news. She will learn when everyone else does with no one to blame but herself. And usually, for people like this, that is the *real* punishment as they can't stand not being in the know or being able to be the one who tells everyone else for the first time.", "NTA but moving forward do not tell her a damn thing about anything you don\u2019t want everyone to know. She is very clearly playing the victim here to avoid responsibility for her choices and is showing that she doesn\u2019t respect your wishes. \n\nIf you continue to give her info that you don\u2019t want anyone else to know you are setting yourself up for failure.", "Nta. I'm sorry. This person goes on an information diet immediately. Don't share gender, names, etc. Make sure your partner is on the same page.", "NTA. People get really upset when they tell someone something they want kept secret but the receiver of that information shares it. \n\nThere really is ONE SIMPLE WAY to fix this.\n\nStop telling other people your secrets. Period. \n\nGoing forward, you and your husband need to set the expectation that if either of you tells another soul, you can expect your secret not to be secret anymore. \n\nLet MIL know you will not be confiding in her in the future. She will find out when everyone else does.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. If anything, this would make me even firmer in my boundaries. Don't tell her anything about the pregnancy, let her know from Facebook when the baby is born. Don't take any crap about your parenting. Put her in her place early and often. Who the hell says \"I will not be reprimanded.\" She stole an Irreplaceable moment from you and she can't even be bothered to put herself in the wrong.", "NTA. Take her completely out of the loop. Tell her that from now on, you will not be sharing updates on your pregnancy, including the gender reveal (if any) and birth, and that she can find out such things along with the rest of the world when **you** make the public announcement.", "I suggest you stop. As in, don't tell her anything. Let her know what's up whenever you want the rest of the world to know. No more inside information. She clearly isn't willing to listen, so adjust accordingly. Have all communications go through your husband, from now on. She texts you, have him text the response. She calls you, don't pick up and let him know he needs to call her back. She doesn't want you to bully her by telling her to be respectful? Then she loses her privilege of communicating with you and having her baby questions answered. NTA", "Now you know that she won\u2019t keep a secret or her word, so she is now on the \u201cneed to know\u201d basis from and will also be the LAST PERSON to know from now on?", "Nta. She's making everything about her. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA.\n\nThis was your moment, your news, your surprise and she stole it from you. She was only thinking of herself and her own excitement. \n\nYou handled the situation a lot better than I would have.", "NTA \n\nBut please - no more chances \n\nNo more information- don\u2019t tell her anything at all \n\nYou now know she can\u2019t be trusted", "I agree with your MIL- stop. Stop sharing updates with her. My own mother did this and this is how she promptly became the last person in my life to receive baby updates. I stopped giving her the real time updates after each scan and appt and only shared once everyone I personally had wanted to share with was updated and when it felt ok for me to do so. I did not tell her my due date, names we were considering or when I went into labor. \n\nShe clearly is unwilling to respect your boundaries and this has consequences. NTA", "NTA, she is unhinged.", "NTA. It comes down to this: you asked her not to do something and she did the thing you asked her not to do. \n\nAdding to this, when confronted with this, she said she \u201ccould not be reprimanded\u201d and called you a bully. Also, apologizing for upsetting you is different than apologizing for breaking your trust. In short, your MIL has refused to admit she did anything wrong and has tried to turn blame back on you. \n\nShe has broken your trust and shown no willingness to take any responsibility for it nor show any desire to change her behavior. You should remember this in the future that she cannot be trusted. And, when she complains about this, bring up this very incident.", "NTA.  I would respond by saying \"done\" and block her and go NC until she can acknowledge and respect boundaries.\n\nShe is dancing around refusing to acknowledge your boundary.. but she is refusing. Just speak to that, draw a line under it and move on.....", " NTA nor the bully but she is. Sounds a bit like gaslighting as well.", "ESH. She was obviously wrong to share your news, but from what you've written here, it sounds like she apologized for it and you still sent this kind of weird legalistic text to her afterwards? I don't blame you for being upset, but this reads like an email from HR, and if she had already apologized then I don't know what you were trying to accomplish with this. Weird way to deal with a family member, IMO.", "ESH\n\nShe clearly overstepped the boundaries that you set which was wrong but you should have handled it better and not sent grumpy texts. You were just looking to have a rant which is fine but she doesn't need to hear it, especially if you know there are other things going on in her life which are difficult. \n\nYou should have calmly explained that you weren't comfortable sharing the results as she had not respected your boundaries about not sharing the news of your pregnancy and then not replied to the second message. Arguing with people on group chats rarely leads to any helpful outcomes especially when it comes to in laws.", "ESH\n\nMIL: For obvious reasons.\n\nYou: For doing it in group chat for everyone to see.   I COMPLETELY understand that ***she was wrong*** & you are *rightfully* upset, but shit like \"circumstances does not excuse someone's prior actions\" is NOT just you expressing your hurt feelings.   You're needling, lecturing, condescending, etc.     If you genuinely wanted to talk this out, you'd do it 1-v-1, not in group so everyone is secretly forced to take sides & gossiping behind your backs.\n\nWhether this relationship was soured before the pregnancy or not, it most definitely is now, because ESH!\n\n>I should preface her apology started with \u201cWould you please stop my nephew\u2026 I cannot be reprimanded right now,\u201d which is why I told her it felt insincere.\n\nShe could be a meddling F that doesn't like being called out, or this could also be code for \"I'm sorry, but please don't do this in the group chat\".", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's an excuse, every time she's being 'told off' she acts like you're killing her so you'll stop, it's pathetic.

No wonder she got herself uninvited from her son's wedding.", "Including the words \"apology\" or \"I'm sorry\" when an offender justifies her behavior does not make their statement an actual apology.

My husband was fully aware of the situation and suggested I do it in our group chat because she has the tendency to attack me and undermine me on a private chat.", "So she's a repeat offender!   Why are you trying so hard to minimize her behavior.   She's in the wrong and living with the consequences of her choices.   Why would limiting information to a need to know exclude the extended family from baby related events?   You can invite them (and her) without premature disclosures.", "If they were not allowed at your wedding why would you want to expose your child to them?", "Yes, it will. But if they're not, there will be no consequences for their actions and she'll just do it again if you get pregnant again later (and with this track record, that's assuming they haven't done something else that caused you and your husband to go NC with them between now and then). Cause and effect is a grade school lesson they clearly lack a concept of.\n\nAnd, on the other hand, if you continue to include them in your life *knowing* they have this track record, you will soon not be able to complain about what they do with this information because you know better. I mean, if you have a cat that has a long track record of knocking cups off end tables, at what point does it become your fault for leaving them there? Everyone is susceptible to their own nature, and it's up to all of us to choose how we adapt to it. The kind of adaption is different for every single person and every single issue... sometimes that adaption is telling a constantly late friend your meeting time is 15 minutes before it actually is so they're on time, and other times it means going NC and learning to live without a person or people (and, of course, everything in-between).", "It sucks in theory, but not in reality. That is in a perfect world you have loving family at events and those events are better, in reality the family sucks, are narcissists, refuse to take responsibility for poor behaviour and actively ruin those events. \n\nFocus on the reality rather than the dream of a perfect family. then build the family you want, focus on them and have those events without the stress.", "NTA\n\nBut here's a question, why did you tell her in the first place when she has bad history with you and your husband?  You mentioned his family was disinvited from the wedding for \"similar reasons\" so I'm not sure why you would have told her in the first place.  Just wait until you were ready to tell everyone and then tell her.  But that horse is out of the gate, so drop it and move on.\n\nHer telling you to STOP, is rude for sure, it's like she is discounting your feelings.  If you can go forward without them in your life (meaning you, your husband and child) without any regrets, that's something you and your husband should decide.  But I'm willing to bet he will have your back whatever the end result is.\n\nGood Luck......NTA", "Maybe it will suck, but if they didn't learn anything from being disinvited to the wedding, that's on them.", "I'm sorry. It doesn't get easier but as long as you have boundaries and nip this kind of crap out, it does get easier. Have a shiny spine and don't be afraid to use it. I wish you all the very best!", "OK... that is different.   I ignorantly misunderstood it to be a wider family audience.\n\nEither way.....   you have history & you're letting that history play a role here (understandable... its hard not to).\n\nI still don't feel you *just* explaining that you're hurt, but that you are trying to actively make her feel worse about it that she already does.  *Maybe I'm waaaaay off*, but this  (in part) comes across as you not just wanting validation that your MIL was wrong, but wanting validation for however mean you are being in retaliation.\n\n*Again, your MIL WAS wrong.*  Just appears you want to put an exclamation point on that fact and make absolutely sure she knows it!!!!\n\nIts your MIL.  Gonna be grandma.   Even she is the root/initial cause of your history, its only going to get worse if you two can't figure out your differences.", "because at the end of the day, she is my husband's mother and he sometimes doesn't see a reason to call her out on her BS for reasons I will never understand.", "Husband\u2019s family is very dysfunctional. They are okay one minute and not okay the next. Recently, we\u2019ve been on good terms until this happened. I shared it with my family and husband had the option to do the same as well. \n\nThis happened late last night and so my husband and I haven\u2019t been able to discuss what happened, but we definitely do need to talk about how we\u2019re going to deal with his family moving forward.", "There is some more context from husband. I told her if we told my mom, she would tell other people. My moms word means nothing. I knew this would happen and had a strategy going forward WHEN it happened.", "He doesn't see a reason to call her out because he has normalized the dysfunction and even though he realizes that she's out of line, it's a constant emotional struggle for him.   The ultimate peace that comes with getting out of the rocking boat -- see [Don't Rock the Boat](https://redd.it/77pxpo)--is not an easy to achieve.\n\nStop enabling her in any way and start looking into more constructive ways to deal with her.   Susan Forward has a couple of books that might help:  *Toxic Parents* for him and *Toxic In-Laws* for you.   She has a third book about emotional blackmail that might help too.", "Husband here\n\nMy strategy personally is to cut contact for long stretches of time. Weeks, months, a year if necessary. She doesn't agree with me and wants to handle it her way i fully support her. Both methods are valid I just find words carry no weight for her and the only real leverage we have is deciding to cut contact or not."]}
