He was the youngest and smallest of the bunch. \n\nI don\u2019t know what came over me. But I jumped in the elevator, grabbed the kid and ran out before the door closed. The kid looked at me like I was crazy and all I could tell them was that the guy was mentally ill. I couldn\u2019t go into full detail because they were so young. Now I look like a weirdo.

Never thought I would say 'I would have done the same thing' to grabbing a random child but yeah, you did the right thing. Any sane parent would thank you for that. Just awkward as heck to explain at first especially if you're not the one breaking the news first.   \n\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think you did well to get the kid out. The parents will thank you when you explain it to them.", "NTA I have a former coworker who dated a man who just snapped at her apartment.

But you could have told them that you saw this man being inappropriate and it was dangerous for him to be alone in an elevator with this man. Of course, you tell their parents and don\u2019t mince words. Police needs to be involved and you witnessed it. So start there. Sounds like he was waiting to get someone alone in the elevator. NTA.", "Why didn't you call the cops? He was committing a crime.", "NTA. Safety first. Always always always, safety is the first priority. You did the right thing. It may look awkward and have put you in a weird position, but you did the right thing.

We don\u2019t want children to associate mental health issues with risks and danger. Just saying, \u201cThat person isn\u2019t safe\u201d would have been best. However, you acted in the moment and obviously didn\u2019t have time to contemplate this.", "NTA", "I think you did the right thing. You kept a young child out of potential danger.

Without even thinking I grabbed a pool towel from our clean basket and ran around the desk and covered her and picked her up and brought her back to my side of the desk. It took a full 15 minutes for her mother to realize the kid had wandered out of the hotel room. The worst part is the dad was in the lobby drinking coffee and didn't even look up when I first said \"hey did anyone lose a kid?\"\n\nThe mom came downstairs frantic in a bathrobe and was really appreciative that I found her daughter. If I hadn't done something, the kid could have wandered out of the automatic doors and into traffic. The mom told me she had gotten in the shower and didn't realize her husband left the room and apparently hadn't pulled the door tight enough, so the kid got out.\n\nYou protected that kid. Their parents will be grateful.", "Completely NTA, if you explain what happened to the parents. They need to know. Don\u2019t mince words.", "As a father myself you definitely are NTA. Any parent would commend you for putting those kids safety first before anything else.", "NTA. You need to contact the leasing agent. I'm sure there are cameras in your lobby.  If there are young children in the building he cannot be alone with them.  Grabbing the child is not ideal, but I have put my hand up/arm out to adults to not get into a certain car on the subway.  It's gut reaction.", "NTA  at all!   Thank God for you and people that actually do the right thing and don't just walk away and say \"none of my business\".    That kid was in danger.", "Please 5150 your neighbor. And then speak to the landlord. If he is willing to jack off in public spaces this will only escalate. \nYou absolutely saved this child from an awful situation. Good for you. NTA", "NTA. I was the kid in a situation like this and I can still remember it now as someone in my late 20s. I would have loved it if someone had removed me from the situation.", "On another note, you could also call your local crisis team to have your neighbor evaluated.  He could be off his meds and be having a break. He may need to be stabilized; I mean obviously this is very unsafe behavior for children and community, right? However, if he is usually congenial and keeps to himself but suddenly he's acting out of what seems to be his baseline, he needs a higher level of care. Good work on saving the child, NTA.", "NTA, and it sounds like those kids were looking to you for help in that moment and you acted. Good work OP", "Sounds like you made a good choice to get the kid out, but I would let the parents, building management and maybe the police know what is going on.

If the parents want an explanation, state what you wrote above.   \nThank you for looking out for the kid.", "Eh, if the kid lives in the building chances are the parents are at least  passingly aware of the mental I\u2019ll man, should be a real easy explanation", "Yta. \n\nYou could have just held the door open for them.

I would definitely have stepped in and done something similar in that situation.

During episodes they may do something that they very much regret later. You snatching the child may very well have saved many people from a traumatic experience and ongoing emotions and actions. I also want to add that you did not judge the unwell tenant, but were stating a factual account, for which I thank you.

There wasn't any way for this to go well, frankly, and you made the choice that resulted in the least harm.

I was really struggling with what to tell them without scarring them. He\u2019s not necessarily a bad person.", "If someone is jerking off in front of minors, that's a sex crime. If this were just someone who looked sketchy, or maybe were just mumbling to themselves, I'd agree with you.

The guy was not in a safe state and the kid didn\u2019t realize.", "Yeah, no. The child wouldn't go with his friends so what makes you think he'd have listened to a complete stranger? Also standing there trying to convince a child to leave would have most certainly alerted this unwell man to what was happening and who knows how he could have reacted to that?  By getting in the lift he would have been potentially putting both of them at risk and for what?  \n\nGrabbing the child wasn't a perfect solution but he's safe and the circumstances can be explained to his parents.

What happens if the guy had spun out again while in the elevator with the kids? He would have traumatised the kids and OP would not have been able to help them all.

I'm not sure who because I live in a different country.  \n\nThis has to be stopped.", "This is the way. In all likelihood the elder child would explain what and why you did because they felt uncomfortable enough to vacate the elevator themselves and you were assisting them in retrieving their sibling/cousin/friend that was not listening.

Up to a point, not a problem, they deserve to be left alone.\n\nThat point has certainly been reached in this case. It's fair to involve the authorities - building management for sure, local security guard if available, police if no one else is available.\n\nCalling police could have a bad outcome. But so could allowing this guy to be alone with a vulnerable person, like a child.", "Call the police - you can call the non emergency number if there is one in your area.  \n\nThis man is acting out and jacking off in public spaces, particularly those that often have children present; he's become a potential danger.\n\nThe police can look into his living situation and get Adult Protective Services (APS) involved - it's like CPS but for adults who can't adequately care for themselves.\n\nMake sure you ask the police for a case/report number - this ensures that they've made a record of the incident so it's on file to show the pattern of behavior.  That way if he does it again they'll be more likely to remove him from the building if necessary in order to protect the children.", "Does the elevator have cameras? Report it to the apartment complex, then to the police. I\u2019m sorry the man is unwell, but he\u2019s doing something illegal (and potentially dangerous) in a public space.

That line is \"a danger to self or others\". \n\nI have a lot of experience with the mentally ill as a caregiver (not as a medical professional, though I have had lengthy conversations with many).  \n\nIf someone is paying for his accomodations now they will likely pay somewhere else after he gets treatment and \"back on track\" if that is possible.", "I understand your concerns about whether he'll get appropriate care for his mental illness.  You're a caring person, and it's wonderful that you weren't concerned about his presence in the building when he was just a little different.\n\nBut yes, you do need to let police and management know now, since he's become a potential danger to others.  The safety of the kids has to trump the safety of this man, even if his behavior isn't something he can control.", "Definetely let the management know and they will deal with the cops. Not doing anything in this situation would be very irresponsible.", "You should absolutely call at least one of them."]}
