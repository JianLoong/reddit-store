Sure, you were together but at the end of the day, it's YOUR business and nothing to do with her, right?", "NTA. Plenty of people provide support in some form prior to the divorce. That doesn\u2019t mean they are beholden to each other forever more", "So, she left you. Your interaction with her now is basically coparenting and the occasional dinner. Frankly, she has nothing to do with the company any more. \n\nNTA. Be prepared to tell your kids why she isn\u2019t there, because you know she will likely let them know she wasn\u2019t invited.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been split up for 5 years why the hell does she think you would go to things together that would be weird. Just politely remind her you\u2019re not married anymore so won\u2019t be doing couples things together.", "NTA\n\nI think your ex is behaving in an entitled manner about this.\n\nThe facts are that you are divorced.

You can invite whomever you wish.  Also, I've also been a stay at home mom and I don't understand how that qualifies as \"you wouldn't be where you are today without her\".  Not that I need an explanation, I just don't get it.  \n\n\nI can understand that it may sting a bit for her that she wasn't invited, but your obligation to invite her to anything ended when she walked out the door.", "NTA. It's your party, you can invite who you want. She may very well have aided in your success but the harsh reality is that when relationships end, certain privileges get revoked. It's possible that she sees you two as friends and not simply cordial for the kid's sake.

This is a family business founded by *your* father. She never worked there,  is no longer part of your family and you don't socialize together. Does she want to show off in front of mutual friends and *your* family members ( who I bet wouldn't want her there) for some reason?  \n\nIf you don't want her there, and you don't, don't invite her. NTA.", "NTA- she\u2019s an ex for a reason and she needs to figure out/accept that.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure the alimony checks she happily cashes is \u201ccredit\u201d enough for whatever her contributions were.", "NTA - you were her link to the company, and she only was involved or knew people there because she was married to you.  You are divorced and have separate lives, so she no longer has that link.  It's unreasonable for her to expect an invitation given all of this. \n\nI suggest having a conversation at some point about boundaries.  Because if you end up with a new partner, I doubt that person will be thrilled about your ex-wife expecting to third-wheel at everything you do.", "NTA, she wants to go to a cool/fun party with people she knows. That's not really enough of a reason.", "NTA. It's very strange that your ex-wife thinks she should be invited to your company's party.", "Thanks for your experience, probably I'm also easily manipulated as I do feel some guilt about it", "that's right, the only thing is that, being a small business, over the years she got to meet some of the people that work here", "Good advice, thanks", "I disagree with it, but some stay at home parents do 100% of everything that involves the children and the home. That allows the other parent to focus 100% on the business. It can be a real advantage for some business owners.", "all interactions we've had in the last few years has been just between us, like dropping off the kids or having dinner betweeen us. this is a bigger event with much more people, some friends (that we have in common) and my side of the family (which she hasn't seen since the divorce)", "I would also like to point out that you also supported her (I assume) if she was a SAHM. It theoretically should be an even balance, she runs the house and keeps the tiny humans alive and you bring in money and contribute to some home stuff. Does that mean because you supported her to be a mother at home you should be automatically invited to all mothers day celebrations etc? You havent done anything wrong and it's really up to you, it might be a nice gesture for your kids but if it sours the event for you, then stick with not inviting her.", "NTA.....so fucking what.....\nIf she was an employee who quit 5 years ago would she be invited to a company get together.....NOPE", "NTA. I see that the past interactions is about you hanging out around / with her as the father of the kids you have with her. But the party would be something else entirely and definitely you are not obliged to invite her.", "This right here. \n\nEven if she was involved in the daily operation of the company, she hasn't been a part of it for 5 years. It's pretty much like an ex-employee who changed jobs.\n\nIf OP is not inviting ex-employees, ex-wife does not qualify for an invite either."]}
