This is a family business founded by *your* father. She never worked there,  is no longer part of your family and you don't socialize together.

I\u2019m sure the alimony checks she happily cashes is \u201ccredit\u201d enough for whatever her contributions were.", "NTA - you were her link to the company, and she only was involved or knew people there because she was married to you.  You are divorced and have separate lives, so she no longer has that link.  It's unreasonable for her to expect an invitation given all of this. \n\nI suggest having a conversation at some point about boundaries.  Because if you end up with a new partner, I doubt that person will be thrilled about your ex-wife expecting to third-wheel at everything you do.", "NTA, she wants to go to a cool/fun party with people she knows. That's not really enough of a reason.", "NTA. It's very strange that your ex-wife thinks she should be invited to your company's party.", "Thanks for your experience, probably I'm also easily manipulated as I do feel some guilt about it", "that's right, the only thing is that, being a small business, over the years she got to meet some of the people that work here", "Good advice, thanks", "I disagree with it, but some stay at home parents do 100% of everything that involves the children and the home. That allows the other parent to focus 100% on the business. It can be a real advantage for some business owners.", "all interactions we've had in the last few years has been just between us, like dropping off the kids or having dinner betweeen us. this is a bigger event with much more people, some friends (that we have in common) and my side of the family (which she hasn't seen since the divorce)", "I would also like to point out that you also supported her (I assume) if she was a SAHM. It theoretically should be an even balance, she runs the house and keeps the tiny humans alive and you bring in money and contribute to some home stuff. Does that mean because you supported her to be a mother at home you should be automatically invited to all mothers day celebrations etc? You havent done anything wrong and it's really up to you, it might be a nice gesture for your kids but if it sours the event for you, then stick with not inviting her.", "NTA.....so fucking what.....\nIf she was an employee who quit 5 years ago would she be invited to a company get together.....NOPE", "NTA. I see that the past interactions is about you hanging out around / with her as the father of the kids you have with her. But the party would be something else entirely and definitely you are not obliged to invite her.", "This right here. \n\nEven if she was involved in the daily operation of the company, she hasn't been a part of it for 5 years. It's pretty much like an ex-employee who changed jobs.\n\nIf OP is not inviting ex-employees, ex-wife does not qualify for an invite either.", "NTA. You 2 have been divorced for 5 years. She's not your friend but your ex-wife. It's good you have a civil relationship now but it took time to get to this point. You don't owe her an invitation to your company's party. If this was a graduation party for one of the kids then she would have an argument to make.", "NTA", "NTA  She left you she has NO SAY in your life.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t need to be invited. That\u2019s it. Let it go.", "NTA, yes when she was your partner it would make sense for her to go. But now? No way. Her ties to the company were cut with the divorce. Another commenter put it in a really good way, \u201cwould an ex-employee who quit 5 years ago expect to be invited to the party?\u201d. Obviously situations vary but even if she\u2019s good friends with some of the people going to the party, she can hang out with them on her own time.", "While I think OP is within his rights not to invite his ex, your comment ignores the historical context (and expectation) of men being able to \u201chave it all\u201d, at least on paper. The successful career, the loving family, a well cared for home.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not really the same thing and doesn\u2019t work both ways.", "You're not wrong...", "Info: how much was your business able to succeed because she took care of everything with the house and the children?", "But, just be prepared for her to show up anyway.  Perhaps have a security person at the door.", "no it really does, being a SAH parent now is a privilege, and she\u2019s lucky that she was able to be home with the kids while OP worked. she chose to stay home, no one forced her like before", "To be clear, we could afford her staying at home, but I never asked her to do that. She could have worked on her career. When kids were very small they all went to daycare to let her breathe at home. Nevertheless I am grateful that they could spend time with their mother instead of some stranger.", "Does it matter? It is something to be considered when alimony is calculated. Not with party invites.", "she left him, she gave up any right to the business and it\u2019s benefits", "Well it's not easy to quantify, I'm sure it played a part, allowing me to work very long hours, I'm not denying that.", "She wouldn't do that, she's not a bad person, it's just strange that she would be so mad at me for this", "NTA.  She's an EX.  She's not your GF.  She's not really even your friend.  If you still wanted to be with her at parties, etc., you probably wouldn't have divorced.", "NTA.. she is not a part of this", "So, if i may ask, why did she leave u? Bc she chose to leave and made her bed... she now needs to lay in it", "NTA - she isn\u2019t friends or family so no invitation", "NTA.  \u201cYou left me and that excludes you from my life going forward except where the kids are concerned\u201d.", "NTA.  A divorce closes a chapter on your life.  It is over.  Maybe some people can be \"friends\" afterwards, but hey civility is the best anyone can hope for.", "NTA, but you said that you have had dinner together since the divorce. Be prepared to see a change in your relationship after this, prepare for an increase in negativity or toxicity from her.", "Not the asshole for not inviting her. \nBut The asshole for discussing it with her without the intention to invite her. There was literally no reason (that you mentioned) to have that discussion with her. In doing so, you gave the impression she was invited, but then blew her off.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t invite her.  Without her you\u2019d have still succeeded.  You\u2019ve made it now this long without her. Keep rocking it\u2026and enjoy your party solo.", "She left you 5 years ago, let me guess she had someone else in mind? Why on earth would she think she is entitled to go to your event? NTA", "NTA and not your problem.  Next time she seems pissed about something, just let her stay pissed.", "Oh well when you put it like that I\u2019m like damn wow crazy being a SAH parent is a privilege now so a millennia of gendered expectations simply vanished this is incredible.\n\nJust kidding.", "While you may not of gotten where you are without her, she would of been at this party had she not left you.\n\nLaughably entitled.\n\nNTA", "[deleted]", "NTA. Is she entitled to come, NO. Could she feel that because you two are in a much better place now and she did help you get to where you are for all those years that you would invite her as a good gesture, entirely possible. While you don't owe her anything, maybe if you explain that while you are in a better place you are not in a place where you are comfortable having her around in social settings that aren't for the kids. That's a boundary you need for your own mental health.", "NTA she left you.", "NTA. What a ridiculous expectation for her to have.", "NTA - I agree with all the other commenters here. Not your responsibility to invite your ex to your company events. You're not wrong to not want your ex there. \n\nJust so it's not an echo chamber in here, it may be worth it to sit down and make sure that you're making the best choice for yourself and your kids. \n\nYou kinda nailed it on the head that it would be a nice thing for you to invite her, but you don't feel any obligation. So you should ask yourself why specifically you don't want to do the nice thing, in this scenario.\n\n Is it because you think she'll behave poorly? Or maybe you have a new girlfriend that wouldn't be happy? Or maybe it's just that you don't want anyone there that you're not currently close to? Or maybe there are still parts of you that aren't completely over the end of the relationship and you know you won't be able to relax if she's there? Or maybe it's because you just don't want to do her any favors unless it's something that the kids would call you out on as bad behavior? Or maybe you're used to your ex stepping all over you and you're trying to put up good boundaries?\n\nI say you should think about this because there is one benefit to her being there. Which is showing your kids that a mature and civil adult relationship is possible. And to show them that despite all your issues with each other, you can still respect your ex's contribution to your business. In short, showing them the type of behavior that you'd want your children's future husbands, wives, exes to show them. \n\nBut again, nothing wrong with not inviting the ex. It's just always a good idea to do the nice thing if there aren't any bad impacts for you.", "Would this have happened had you gone NC with her after the divorce? Isn't that what a divorce is for?", "The ONLY reason you're trying to be civil, is the fact that you share not yet adult children.", "I'm a stay at home mom, my husband has always worked full time outside the house. Over the 15 years together, I've had several outside the house jobs ranging from 4 hrs a week to 3 12 hr shifts. I also had several points where I watched my sister's kids for pay or other friends kids. While my husband was at work I handled everything else.\n\n\nGrocery shopping, cooking 95% of everyone's meals including his lunches that he would take and reheat, buying gifts for all family members events for both sides, handling all insurance things and doctors appointments for 3 kids, doing 80% of the washing and drying of clothes and 100% of the folding and putting away. Handling all the car insurance/maintaining/ keeping clean and having appropriate car seats for all the kids. Handling all the preschool forms/pick up and drop off/sick kid phone calls, and this continued to present day with them all still in school. Handling all the bills and juggling the finances. Dealing with any financial institutions or basically anything with money. Keeping the house clean, including but not limited to washing floors, windows, and furniture (sticky hands get everywhere) vacuuming, changing bed linens, dusting, sweeping, cleaning the bathtub, toilet, and everyone else in the bathroom. Fixing the many things that can break from a light bulb going out to a vacuum belt snapping all the way up to rewiring an outlet for the dryer in the basement. \n\n\nI could go on but I think you may get the drift. She absolutely helped him get to where he is.", "What I meant is that I see our current \"friendly\" relationship as a good achievement, compared to what I see around me. It also took some effort to reach this point. Still it seems like it's not enough for her.\nBut I see your point. Maybe I should have, but I'm afraid at this point it wouldn't change anything.", "The discussion was simply something like \"on that day I'll drop them off a bit later than usual because of that\" but yeah, I hadn't really given it much thought, I probably should have avoided the discussion altogether", "NTA Dude, she started the divorce. This isn\u2019t an abuse situation, she had to know doing it that she would have to take her lumps.", "Not necessarily.\n\nThe other parent also focuses on the children and household chores as well as working full time", "And his contribution to the marriage allowed her to be a SAHM.  One is not more valuable than the other.", "Ah ok. I understabd now. \nThen no, not the asshole there either. She assumed she'd be invited (which I don't understand why she would, given the history), and you corrected her. Seems like she's an manipulator and is being ridiculous.", "That isn't the type of arrangement I was referring to. I was referring to partners where the stay at home parent agrees to take 100% of the responsibility for childcare and housework so the other parent can focus solely on building their business.", "Famous last words, \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t do that...\u201d"]}
