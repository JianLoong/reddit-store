Sure, you were together but at the end of the day, it's YOUR business and nothing to do with her, right?", "NTA. Plenty of people provide support in some form prior to the divorce. That doesn\u2019t mean they are beholden to each other forever more", "So, she left you. Your interaction with her now is basically coparenting and the occasional dinner. Frankly, she has nothing to do with the company any more. \n\nNTA. Be prepared to tell your kids why she isn\u2019t there, because you know she will likely let them know she wasn\u2019t invited.", "NTA.

It's your party, you can invite who you want. She may very well have aided in your success but the harsh reality is that when relationships end, certain privileges get revoked.

This is a family business founded by *your* father. She never worked there,  is no longer part of your family and you don't socialize together. Does she want to show off in front of mutual friends and *your* family members ( who I bet wouldn't want her there) for some reason?  \n\nIf you don't want her there, and you don't, don't invite her. NTA.", "NTA- she\u2019s an ex for a reason and she needs to figure out/accept that.", "NTA. I\u2019m sure the alimony checks she happily cashes is \u201ccredit\u201d enough for whatever her contributions were.", "NTA - you were her link to the company, and she only was involved or knew people there because she was married to you.  You are divorced and have separate lives, so she no longer has that link.  It's unreasonable for her to expect an invitation given all of this. \n\nI suggest having a conversation at some point about boundaries.  Because if you end up with a new partner, I doubt that person will be thrilled about your ex-wife expecting to third-wheel at everything you do.", "NTA, she wants to go to a cool/fun party with people she knows. That's not really enough of a reason.", "NTA. It's very strange that your ex-wife thinks she should be invited to your company's party.", "Thanks for your experience, probably I'm also easily manipulated as I do feel some guilt about it", "that's right, the only thing is that, being a small business, over the years she got to meet some of the people that work here", "Good advice, thanks", "I disagree with it, but some stay at home parents do 100% of everything that involves the children and the home. That allows the other parent to focus 100% on the business. It can be a real advantage for some business owners.", "all interactions we've had in the last few years has been just between us, like dropping off the kids or having dinner betweeen us. this is a bigger event with much more people, some friends (that we have in common) and my side of the family (which she hasn't seen since the divorce)", "I would also like to point out that you also supported her (I assume) if she was a SAHM. It theoretically should be an even balance, she runs the house and keeps the tiny humans alive and you bring in money and contribute to some home stuff. Does that mean because you supported her to be a mother at home you should be automatically invited to all mothers day celebrations etc? You havent done anything wrong and it's really up to you, it might be a nice gesture for your kids but if it sours the event for you, then stick with not inviting her.", "NTA.....so fucking what.....\nIf she was an employee who quit 5 years ago would she be invited to a company get together.....NOPE", "NTA. I see that the past interactions is about you hanging out around / with her as the father of the kids you have with her. But the party would be something else entirely and definitely you are not obliged to invite her.", "This right here. \n\nEven if she was involved in the daily operation of the company, she hasn't been a part of it for 5 years. It's pretty much like an ex-employee who changed jobs.\n\nIf OP is not inviting ex-employees, ex-wife does not qualify for an invite either.", "NTA. You 2 have been divorced for 5 years. She's not your friend but your ex-wife. It's good you have a civil relationship now but it took time to get to this point. You don't owe her an invitation to your company's party. If this was a graduation party for one of the kids then she would have an argument to make.", "NTA", "NTA  She left you she has NO SAY in your life.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t need to be invited. That\u2019s it. Let it go.", "NTA, yes when she was your partner it would make sense for her to go. But now? No way. Her ties to the company were cut with the divorce. Another commenter put it in a really good way, \u201cwould an ex-employee who quit 5 years ago expect to be invited to the party?\u201d. Obviously situations vary but even if she\u2019s good friends with some of the people going to the party, she can hang out with them on her own time.", "While I think OP is within his rights not to invite his ex, your comment ignores the historical context (and expectation) of men being able to \u201chave it all\u201d, at least on paper. The successful career, the loving family, a well cared for home.\n\nSo no, it\u2019s not really the same thing and doesn\u2019t work both ways.", "You're not wrong...", "Info: how much was your business able to succeed because she took care of everything with the house and the children?", "But, just be prepared for her to show up anyway.  Perhaps have a security person at the door.", "no it really does, being a SAH parent now is a privilege, and she\u2019s lucky that she was able to be home with the kids while OP worked. she chose to stay home, no one forced her like before", "To be clear, we could afford her staying at home, but I never asked her to do that. She could have worked on her career. When kids were very small they all went to daycare to let her breathe at home. Nevertheless I am grateful that they could spend time with their mother instead of some stranger.", "Does it matter? It is something to be considered when alimony is calculated. Not with party invites.", "she left him, she gave up any right to the business and it\u2019s benefits", "Well it's not easy to quantify, I'm sure it played a part, allowing me to work very long hours, I'm not denying that.", "She wouldn't do that, she's not a bad person, it's just strange that she would be so mad at me for this", "NTA.  She's an EX.  She's not your GF.  She's not really even your friend.  If you still wanted to be with her at parties, etc., you probably wouldn't have divorced.", "NTA.. she is not a part of this", "So, if i may ask, why did she leave u? Bc she chose to leave and made her bed... she now needs to lay in it", "NTA - she isn\u2019t friends or family so no invitation", "NTA.  \u201cYou left me and that excludes you from my life going forward except where the kids are concerned\u201d.", "NTA.  A divorce closes a chapter on your life.  It is over.  Maybe some people can be \"friends\" afterwards, but hey civility is the best anyone can hope for.", "NTA, but you said that you have had dinner together since the divorce. Be prepared to see a change in your relationship after this, prepare for an increase in negativity or toxicity from her.", "Not the asshole for not inviting her. \nBut The asshole for discussing it with her without the intention to invite her. There was literally no reason (that you mentioned) to have that discussion with her. In doing so, you gave the impression she was invited, but then blew her off.", "NTA\n\nDon\u2019t invite her.  Without her you\u2019d have still succeeded.  You\u2019ve made it now this long without her. Keep rocking it\u2026and enjoy your party solo.", "She left you 5 years ago, let me guess she had someone else in mind? Why on earth would she think she is entitled to go to your event? NTA", "NTA and not your problem.  Next time she seems pissed about something, just let her stay pissed.", "Oh well when you put it like that I\u2019m like damn wow crazy being a SAH parent is a privilege now so a millennia of gendered expectations simply vanished this is incredible.\n\nJust kidding."]}
