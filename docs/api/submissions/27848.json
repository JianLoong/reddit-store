Omg who on earth could find fault with Poirot? Also Agatha Christie was a pretty revolutionary writer, some of her books should be considered classic literature (looking at you The Murder of Roger Ackroyd). Besides that, it\u2019s YOUR house. You put books in a drawer and her child went rummaging in drawers he shouldn\u2019t even be opening. Tell her she needs to teach her son to respect other people\u2019s property. If she does not apologize, they need to go find a hotel. If they can afford renovations, than they can pay for a place to stay.", "NTA. BIL was not concerned with his wife saddling you with her parenting responsibilities, so why should you be concerned with the hornets nest they created? Them getting a hotel during their renovations would solve all issues.", "BIL had the audacity to tell you to apologize to his wife for his son finding something you kept in your drawers. Yes I agree if they have problems with your house they could move. How would they expect you to carry your whole library of murder mystery novels to work.", "So much this! She has a lot of nerve being a guest in your home, and then trying to make demands about  how and where you keep your things. This isn\u2019t about guns, drugs, or porn. Agatha Christie novellas aren\u2019t racy, gruesome, or morbid, and I think are perfectly appropriate for a 12 year old.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

She is far too controlling with reading material.  He can probably get that stuff at the library anyway. They kind of still exist (sad as it is that the libraries barely exist any longer)", "\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31 I just had to look it up. My copy from the used book store said Ten Little Indians, I had no idea that wasn\u2019t the original title.", "I had to sneak them. It was the early 90s and reading King wasn't \"lady like\". Lol\nI read Night Watch, cujo, and Salem's lot! Stole them from my brother. Lol", "My mom just straight up gave 'em to me. I was a voracious reader as a kid, and my mom had a lot of books. There were lots of things that I didn't get (I thought Animal Farm was just a story with a sad ending) and sometimes I'd be defeated by vocabulary (looking at you, Silmarillion) but mostly I got by ok. When it came to some horror stories, though, my imagination was just too good.", "She still to this day (good naturedly now) blames all my weirdness on Stephen King. Lol.\nAnd I agree on Animal Farm. It is a sad ending. \nI read a lot of Joe Hill, Grady Hendrix, and of course... King. Lol"]}
