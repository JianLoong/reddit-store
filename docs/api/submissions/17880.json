Due to what my son does, and the fact I know he uses reddit, I'm keeping details vague. My son is on the spectrum, but is extremely high functioning with an IQ to match and works in a position that requires a top secret security clearance doing IT work. He makes enough money so we can live comfortably, splitting the household chores. (He's happy living at home and pays the mortgage as compensation.) It's important to note that I do the laundry. His girlfriend lives overseas and generally only comes to stay with us when she's done with her classes for the semester.\n\nMy son has a bathrobe that he likes to wear while in his room while doing whatever in there, and always comes out dressed in at least sweatpants and a tshirt. His robe smells like a rotting corpse and in extension makes the rest of his room stink, I've tried to reason with him but he's always refused to letting me wash it or letting it air dry outside for a bit. He says he can tell the difference the last time he let me air dry it for 2 hours. He allows me to put in a Febreze wall clips, but it's not getting rid of the smell.\n\nCut to yesterday, My son was in the shower this morning getting ready for a meeting, and I was in his room grabbing his laundry hamper, and decided to take his robe too to wash as I couldn't bear the stench it was giving anymore. He didn't seem to notice when he got out of the shower and raced out of the house after he got dressed. When he got back, my son went back up to his room while talking on the phone with his girlfriend and I heard screaming a few seconds later, with him walking past me (now in a tshirt and sweatpants) into the backyard where he threw his robe into our back yard fire pit and burned the thing without saying a word to me, going back to his room and slamming the door after it finished burning.\n\nHis girlfriend called me three hours after that, and she told me that he instantly noticed that I washed it and she spent that entire time trying to calm him down over the phone. I got him another one on Amazon, which was identically  the same thing and gave it to him before he wordlessly tried it on and threw it back at me before slamming the door in my face and emailing me a 30 day notice to vacate (edit: him moving out, not kicking me out) a few minutes later.\n\nMy son's always had a sensitivity to stuff being done with his clothes (he triple washed his suit because the collar was apparently itchy, and was then satisfied washing it in just plain cold water the fourth time) I use a detergent that he specially picked out for me to use on his clothes and I've generally never heard any complaints from me doing his other clothes.\n\nAm I the asshole for washing my son's robe?\n\nedit: a word, autocorrect sorry.edit 2: It's my house, he pays the mortgage in lieu of rent.

Perhaps adults should stop coddling adults regardless of diagnoses because being unwashed to the point of smelling like death isn\u2019t something that should be tolerated.

As your roommate he has given you 30days notice so you can arrange for the mortgage payments.\n\nI think it may be a good thing for you to have your own space and for him to live his life as per his wishes.

Maybe it\u2019s best you don\u2019t live together", "According to you he paid the mortgage on time and only wore it in his room.  I really don't see how it affected you at all.

People on the spectrum have very unique and specific ideas about things sometimes especially textures. I think you effed up a good thing.  Apologize profusely and ask him if there\u2019s anyway that you two could work it out.", "ESH though honestly I'm leaning towards YTA tbh. I'm sure that you know that the sensory impacts of changing a comfort item can be meltdown inducing and you deliberately, against his wishes, did that to his primary comfort item. \n\nYour son sucks because you raised the issue multiple times and he didn't work with you to find a mutually agreeable solution. That level of hygiene issue is a problem and he will eventually need to address it. \n\nBut you suck more for disregarding his genuine, albeit unusual, needs and violating his clearly expressed boundaries. If it was intolerable enough to jeopardise your relationship, you should have had a direct discussion and set the boundary that it needs to change or you will not have him live there anymore. Acting against his will and crossing clearly expressed boundaries is not justified regardless of hygiene, you had many other options and you chose the nuclear one. \n\nFrom your post it's clear you don't grasp the gravity of what you did so here's an analogy - imagine your mother died when you were a child and the only thing you had to remember her by was a Teddy bear that smelled like her. You cuddled it every night and whenever you're sad, it made you feel like she's still there and you're safe. Then your dad decides that the Teddy bear is too grubby and needs a wash and, despite your repeated protests and explanations, he washes it and it no longer smells like your mum. You can never get that back, you've lost that connection to her forever. Sure, one day you'll find other ways to cope and feel connected to her, but you'll never smell her again and you'll always feel differently about your dad. That's on the level of what you just did to your son. \n\nRegardless of whether other people think you're TA or not, your relationship with your kid is currently in crisis and nothing short of an unequivocal apology and plan to make amends has any chance at repairing it. No justification, just a clear apology where you take full responsibility and explain that you didn't realise the impact but have now realised how badly you screwed up - with details on why it wasn't OK and what you will do differently in the future. Or you can justify it to yourself with all the (presumably allistic) people voting you NTA and lose the relationship with your son. Ultimately you're the one who has to live with the consequences to your relationship so it's time to decide if it's more important to be right or to have him in your life at all.", "YTA. Sorry not sorry. You know your son is on the spectrum and regardless of that he set a boundary and you ignored it. He is a grown adult. If you don't like the smell you need to sit down and tell him to get his own place.", "He gave you a 30day vacate notice, you said he lived at home.  So this is not your house?  Apparently you knew he is attached to that robe and it's smell for whatever reason.  No you should not have just taken it.  His reaction isn't A-typical for someone on the spectrum.    \n\n\nIt doesn't matter that you launder his other clothes and they aren't the issue, as your title implies... this is about his robe.  Yes YTA.  You violated all sorts of his boundaries doing what you did, no matter how well intended.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

To any autistic person, messing with their comfort items is automatically AH behaviour regardless of justification. While he wasn't in the clear because of the smell, her behaviour was way out of line. If it was enough of an issue to cross this boundary, it was enough of an issue to kick him out. \n\nThat's effectively what she's done by choosing this course of action, though in such a way that she can present it with herself as the victim of his unreasonable reaction instead of him being the victim of her lack of flexibility in accommodating his disability. She could have negotiated until they found a mutually agreeable solution but instead she appeared to agree and then took action directly against his wishes in a way that would have induced a meltdown for most autistic people. \n\nThe issue was contained to his room. She could have told him she won't go in anymore. If her concern was the smell getting into the walls, she could have approached that - he probably would have been willing to put up plastic sheeting or wash the walls regularly. If her concern was his health she could have approached with facts and brainstormed solutions together. But she decided she knew best and in the process effectively destroyed his most relied on comfort item. In the process she also lied to him - she agreed to leave it alone then broke her word. That's borderline unforgivable to most autistic people, in a fairly involuntary way - the autistic desire for justice is much stronger than the desire for interpersonal relationships so when injustice is perceived it often destroys emotional connection. \n\nSo whether allistic people think she's TA or not, her son most certainly does and he's fully justified in that. If she understood his neurology, she would have grasped how significant a transgression this would be. If she understood and cared about how he felt, she would have found an alternative path to meet both of their needs.
