Due to what my son does, and the fact I know he uses reddit, I'm keeping details vague. My son is on the spectrum, but is extremely high functioning with an IQ to match and works in a position that requires a top secret security clearance doing IT work. He makes enough money so we can live comfortably, splitting the household chores. (He's happy living at home and pays the mortgage as compensation.) It's important to note that I do the laundry. His girlfriend lives overseas and generally only comes to stay with us when she's done with her classes for the semester.\n\nMy son has a bathrobe that he likes to wear while in his room while doing whatever in there, and always comes out dressed in at least sweatpants and a tshirt. His robe smells like a rotting corpse and in extension makes the rest of his room stink, I've tried to reason with him but he's always refused to letting me wash it or letting it air dry outside for a bit. He says he can tell the difference the last time he let me air dry it for 2 hours. He allows me to put in a Febreze wall clips, but it's not getting rid of the smell.\n\nCut to yesterday, My son was in the shower this morning getting ready for a meeting, and I was in his room grabbing his laundry hamper, and decided to take his robe too to wash as I couldn't bear the stench it was giving anymore. He didn't seem to notice when he got out of the shower and raced out of the house after he got dressed. When he got back, my son went back up to his room while talking on the phone with his girlfriend and I heard screaming a few seconds later, with him walking past me (now in a tshirt and sweatpants) into the backyard where he threw his robe into our back yard fire pit and burned the thing without saying a word to me, going back to his room and slamming the door after it finished burning.\n\nHis girlfriend called me three hours after that, and she told me that he instantly noticed that I washed it and she spent that entire time trying to calm him down over the phone. I got him another one on Amazon, which was identically  the same thing and gave it to him before he wordlessly tried it on and threw it back at me before slamming the door in my face and emailing me a 30 day notice to vacate a few minutes later.\n\nMy son's always had a sensitivity to stuff being done with his clothes (he triple washed his suit because the collar was apparently itchy, and was then satisfied washing it in just plain cold water the fourth time) I use a detergent that he specially picked out for me to use on his clothes and I've generally never heard any complaints from me doing his other clothes.\n\nAm I the asshole for washing my son's robe?\n\nedit: a word, autocorrect sorry.  \nedit 2: It's my house, he pays the mortgage in lieu of rent. His idea, not my request.\n\n  \nUpdate: The girlfriend texted me that she's flying over to be with him and look for places in her country.", "created_utc": 1684714226, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13oatdq/aita_for_doing_my_sons_laundry/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guess she's a keeper.", "NTA - that smell is not ok. What germs/bacteria are living in that robe that it smells like it\u2019s decomposing? \n\nHe\u2019s an adult, you can\u2019t smell like a rotting corpse.", "NTA. You did violate a boundary, but I do not believe it was at all malicious. It\u2019s your home, you can\u2019t stand the smell, it\u2019s not really healthy for that to be touching his skin either, it\u2019s understandable. Autistic people can still act like a-holes, which I think your son was doing to some extent\u2026 burning the robe was unnecessary and definitely intended to send a message. But probably in more of a teenage \u201clet me do my thing mom I\u2019m a grownup\u201d kind of way that a malicious way, too. Both of your feelings are understandable really. \n\nI would say apologize but be honest that you just can\u2019t live with certain things, that it\u2019s not clean or healthy, see if you two can work something out where he can be comfortable but you don\u2019t have to smell a rotting corpse in your home. Or perhaps living separately would be better for both of you, if he\u2019s able.", "Info: is it your house or his house? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fully answered here.\n\nETA for the additional info: the robe was stinking up your house. You talked to him about washing it and he refused. You tried other methods (air drying/ Febreeze) and it still didn\u2019t help. I personally would\u2019ve had one more conversation in which you said wash it or it\u2019s going to be thrown away before actually doing it. However I\u2019m going with NTA. Whether he\u2019s on the spectrum or not there still needs be a line drawn when it comes to cleanliness of clothing. However don\u2019t be surprised when he follows through on moving out because of this.", "Nta and don\u2019t call on him what\u2019s likely a bluff of the 30 days to vacate email. He sounds very intelligent and like he\u2019s quite capable of handling his own laundry and such.", "NTA Your son obviously has issues. As for the eviction notice if the house is in your name he can't evict you. If he's that over the edge perhaps he should give the eviction notice to himself. As for everything else:  good luck.", "NTA - I understand getting used to a specific feel of clothing, but REFUSING to wash something is taking it into an unhealthy zone", "NTA. \n\nBut to be an AH myself, how does he have a girlfriend?", "NTA. Perhaps adults should stop coddling adults regardless of diagnoses because being unwashed to the point of smelling like death isn\u2019t something that should be tolerated. If your grown son is throwing a temper tantrum because you were nice enough to wash his filthy bathrobe, you\u2019ve sheltered him for too long.", "Your not the AH but you also cannot stop your son from leaving the house. As your roommate he has given you 30days notice so you can arrange for the mortgage payments.\n\nI think it may be a good thing for you to have your own space and for him to live his life as per his wishes. If he wants a stinky bathrobe as an adult that\u2019s something he will have to deal in his own.", "NTA", "NTA", "Is he can't evict you from your house.", "Esh, your son obviously has sensory issues with clothes. Instead of working on it you touch his robe that he explicitly told you not to touch. \n\nIf you were not able to handle the smell and figuring out a way with your son to get rid of the smell. Then you should have asked him to move out.\n\nYou didnt stop him from repeating this behavior at his new place. All you did was damage your relationship with your son.\n\nNow your son reaction was not necessary. He could have expressed his feelings after he was able to do it in a calm matter.", "Well, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  You should have left well enough alone.  He warned you to.  YTA, but mildly.  Try to talk to him in a few days when he has calmed down some more.", "ESH you shouldnt have just washed it if he\u2019s on the spectrum it means more to him then people without autism. He also doesn\u2019t get to keep something so gross it makes the whole room smell. Your living as roommate then you both should agree on it before you did anything. Can he evict you? Maybe it\u2019s best you don\u2019t live together", "According to you he paid the mortgage on time and only wore it in his room.  I really don't see how it affected you at all.  If he was your tenant and not your son I don't think you would have taken such liberties with his belongings.  You overstepped.  And now the comfortable life that he afforded for both of you will end.  YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou were told multiple times not to do something, and you did it anyway", "He asked you not to touch his robe and you did it anyway. Not cool. People on the spectrum have very unique and specific ideas about things sometimes especially textures. I think you effed up a good thing.  Apologize profusely and ask him if there\u2019s anyway that you two could work it out.", "ESH though honestly I'm leaning towards YTA tbh. I'm sure that you know that the sensory impacts of changing a comfort item can be meltdown inducing and you deliberately, against his wishes, did that to his primary comfort item. \n\nYour son sucks because you raised the issue multiple times and he didn't work with you to find a mutually agreeable solution. That level of hygiene issue is a problem and he will eventually need to address it. \n\nBut you suck more for disregarding his genuine, albeit unusual, needs and violating his clearly expressed boundaries. If it was intolerable enough to jeopardise your relationship, you should have had a direct discussion and set the boundary that it needs to change or you will not have him live there anymore. Acting against his will and crossing clearly expressed boundaries is not justified regardless of hygiene, you had many other options and you chose the nuclear one. \n\nFrom your post it's clear you don't grasp the gravity of what you did so here's an analogy - imagine your mother died when you were a child and the only thing you had to remember her by was a Teddy bear that smelled like her. You cuddled it every night and whenever you're sad, it made you feel like she's still there and you're safe. Then your dad decides that the Teddy bear is too grubby and needs a wash and, despite your repeated protests and explanations, he washes it and it no longer smells like your mum. You can never get that back, you've lost that connection to her forever. Sure, one day you'll find other ways to cope and feel connected to her, but you'll never smell her again and you'll always feel differently about your dad. That's on the level of what you just did to your son. \n\nRegardless of whether other people think you're TA or not, your relationship with your kid is currently in crisis and nothing short of an unequivocal apology and plan to make amends has any chance at repairing it. No justification, just a clear apology where you take full responsibility and explain that you didn't realise the impact but have now realised how badly you screwed up - with details on why it wasn't OK and what you will do differently in the future. Or you can justify it to yourself with all the (presumably allistic) people voting you NTA and lose the relationship with your son. Ultimately you're the one who has to live with the consequences to your relationship so it's time to decide if it's more important to be right or to have him in your life at all.", "YTA. Sorry not sorry. You know your son is on the spectrum and regardless of that he set a boundary and you ignored it. He is a grown adult. If you don't like the smell you need to sit down and tell him to get his own place.", "He gave you a 30day vacate notice, you said he lived at home.  So this is not your house?  Apparently you knew he is attached to that robe and it's smell for whatever reason.  No you should not have just taken it.  His reaction isn't A-typical for someone on the spectrum.    \n\n\nIt doesn't matter that you launder his other clothes and they aren't the issue, as your title implies... this is about his robe.  Yes YTA.  You violated all sorts of his boundaries doing what you did, no matter how well intended.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
