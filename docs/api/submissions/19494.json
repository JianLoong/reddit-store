If you\u2019re unable to fully cover your rent you can\u2019t afford equestrian hobbies. This is insane I seriously recommend cutting a few things out. Caleb hammer on YouTube is a great financial channel, I think you should watch his videos and see just how insane all this sounds.

She's getting an expensive hobby funded for her and is able to spend money when she likes while you're working two jobs to support that. Sit her down and tell her that this needs to stop, and if she can't understand that and change to have a career that supports, not debilitates, your lives then put your foot down and split finances, pay bills equally and then what's left of each of your wages is your own.", "You and your wife need to sit down with a credit counselor.

Like in competitions or something, but since she has to win or place it is not always guaranteed that she makes up the money she spends on horse upkeep. That is not your fault. Your wife is not managing her money and time well and it is not fair you are shouldering the burden. She needs to spend less money and find a part time job, heck if she needs to practice a lot make it a job related to horses. Teaching, assisting, cleaning, but she needs to bring in more money. Any money helps, her working for $12 an hour for five hours for five days a week will make like $15k. That would leave her time to practice with horse but also make money.", "YTA.

Re-prioritise your finances, and if she\u2019s not willing to do that, re-prioritise whether you want to be married.  I personally couldn\u2019t handle being married to someone that financially irresponsible\u2026 but maybe we are different. Maybe it doesn\u2019t stress you out as much.

Equipment, training etc. But eventually for that sport to turn into a career it has to be making you money so it limits the financial loss. Eventually it will be where you are making solely a profit. It can take time, but you have to be able to afford it. Affording it means putting in your own effort, not relying on your partner to do all the effort to allow you to spend more than you can afford. If she wants to continue this as a career then she needs to find a way to start making money out of it or pick up a side job to be able to afford the career she wants to pursue. You think that every athlete in the world has been able to get away with not having a job to help fund their career?\n\nBut you are the AH because you're not realising that you are going to work yourself into the ground.
