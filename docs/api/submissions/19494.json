Youre wife needs a strict budget with no access to any accounts and only one card with a low limit. \n\nNTA shes the only horrible parent and irresponsible person in this post", "ESH, but especially YTA.   \n\n\nYou say your wife's job costs 38,000$ a year. Assuming that is purely in the red, as in you only lose money on it, that's a big thing you need to realistically talk to them about downsizing.   \n\n\nBut in your list of expenses, you dropped **golf?** You clearly have a skewed idea of finances and reality. If you're always behind on payments and you needed to take out a loan, you're even more of an AH because you're taking out a loan you probably can't afford, and setting yourself further back to afford... a photographer for an 8 year old birthday party?   \n\n\nIt sounds like you're trying to live beyond your means for the sake of looking good, or because your wife wants to look good, whatever the reason may be.", "Yes YTA because u should be there for yoyr daughters bday.yoyr child needs your actual presence.\nAnd you are running away from all the issues rather than dealing with the financial situation by cutting things out and having a conversations about what u guys can afford.\nYoyr CHILD is paying the biggest price and thats not okay. She did not make these choices you and mom did", "YTA and so is your wife\n\nHow can you continue this loss? You are going to end up with health issues - you need to be around for your family \nThis level of stress and work will lead to serious health issues. \n\nHow is your wife not seeing this, and how are you allowing all this?\n\nYou\u2019re both major AHs here.", "ESH i see a foreclosure in the future", "ESH. Y'all need separate finances. She can pay for her horse hobby and maybe the utilities and other unimportant things like a photographer, and you can do the rest. \nLet her have to figure out how to keep her horse. You need to do better by being firm instead of just working yourself to death.", "This! A 38k p/a money pit isn't a \"career\", it's a ridiculously expensive hobby that your wife enjoys while you're out working two jobs and still failing to meet your financial commitments. What on earth are you playing at fella? You may be TA for missing your daughters birthday, but your wife is a bigger a-hole for being a huge drain on family finances and then having zero empathy when it comes to understanding why you're taking every shift you can get your hands on. Just, WOW!", "Some people working full time don't even *make* $38k a year.", "LOVE dril LOL\n\nbut I think I'd say ESH, OP and his wife need to sit down and come up with a more feasible budget for the family. It's not fair that OP is having to do all this extra work, as his wife wants to have her cake and eat it too, but OP should also stand up for himself!\n\n(Also, my ESH vote is coming from someone who had both parents miss their 10th birthday because they were going abroad! LOL)", "And the wife is blameless? If her \u201ccareer\u201d costs $38k she doesn\u2019t have a career, she has a hobby. \n\nMy biggest thing here is that it almost sounds like financial abuse. The wife is spending and spending but unwilling to address the issue and gets mad at OP when he\u2019s trying to bring in money without looking in a mirror. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there is, but at the very very least the wife is a huge AH too.", "my family is dying \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "I wish rent was $800", "OP\u2019s wife is living in la-la land.

Who needs professional photos of an eight year olds party?", "Not $550 for a photographer. The original photographer fee PLUS $550 for a better one.", "You can be financially irresponsible AND a bad father. This guy is both.", "Yeah, I had to laugh at the \"equestrian career\" that costs $38K/year  - I think OP is confused on which direction the money flows when you have an actual job. Then he added in gated community, horse, stable, student loans, shopping and golf... I now have little sympathy for this fool and his wife.", "I mean, true, but OP also made it pretty clear that they're living beyond their means in every way possible.\n\nLike, at least the horses are career-related. The golf, shopping, fancy parties (they hired a photographer for an eighth birthday!) etc. etc. etc. aren't. And OP wouldn't be sweating over the mortgage so much if they didn't live in a gated community they can't afford.\n\nI think OP is drawing a lot of attention to the horses because they're the one expense that is clearly not their fault. But every spending decision in this entire post is a mistake, including many OP was involved in.", ">Does your wife bring in any money as an equestrienne?

And unless she herself is a trainer, getting paid to school horses and give lessons.... She's just got a horse to play with, and you and the kids are getting zero out of her hobby except massive debt. \n\nTime for the hard convo about where her priorities lie. The future of your kids, or her *pony*. College fund or *her pony*, braces or *her pony*. \n\nNTA and if she won't get a job that supports  her children and saves for their future, tell her she can bunk in with the horse.

The fact OP includes shopping & golf as a reason they are late on their mortgage. \n\nESH. Y\u2019all need to get your priorities in order", "Surely it's ESH. I'm not sure why you're giving the wife a pass when she's very much the reason they're in debt to begin with and why he needed to take the shift.

We were always taught that the first thing to pay for was the roof over your head", "Given that you're the one bringing in the money, responsibility for making sure the bills are paid unfortunately falls to you. I would suggest giving your wife notice that, effective immediately, you will only be paying for NECESSITIES. Open a separate bank account if necessary. Mortgage, utilities, transportation, food, loans. Freeze your credit so that she's not taking loans or maxing out the cards when they get paid down. That's it. EVERYTHING extra--hobbies, horses, shopping, expensive parties--only gets funded if wife gets a job and pays for it.\n\nYou need to ensure the basic needs of your family, and that isn't going to happen for long unless you make some serious changes now.", "Yep. Not to mention $550 for a SECOND \"party photographer\"?  WTF?? \n\nOP - there are financial decisions being made *by your wife* that have a FAR worse impact on your daughter's life than your missing her party - which you are missing *because* of those financial decisions.

So the original photographer fee PLUS an additional $550.", "But is it really career related?? I mean she would have to make $40,000/year just to break even. IF she breaks even. They're consistently late on the mortgage, which wouldn't be a problem if that money wasn't going out. If she makes $50,000 that's only $10,000 profit. Is that worth it? I highly doubt she's making that much becsuse then OP would have no need to mention the $38,000 going to the horses.\n\nETA: Redid math.", "You need to sort your finances out with or without her\n\nBut you are effectively punishing your child\n\nThis age is probably the most important age to teach kids and form that bond to carry through the teenage years.

There\u2019s also ways to offset costs, my mare is leased out, so I have girl who pay me to use her, I only pay about $250/month and farrier+vet costs.
