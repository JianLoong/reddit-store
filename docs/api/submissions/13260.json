I bought my boyfriend a record player for Xmas as well as a vinyl and typewriter. A month later we broke up after a huge fight. Mocked me for being depressed (and worse which this subreddit is censoring). I broke up with him that night and he said that if I didn\u2019t take everything I bought him with me he would leave it in the road to be taken. Or throw it away. He was very angry and insistent about this. I asked him to please keep the things and he said no. Very firmly. I didn\u2019t think we would get back together as he had been so horrible to me. When I moved back with my mom she asked if she could have it since she had. Bunch of records. I said sure. I had no use for it and looking at it made me sad.\n\nFast forward, we got back together after 2 months, after him begging me to talk to him for one month, and he is saying I\u2019m an asshole for giving my mom the record player. Hes acting like I\u2019m so wrong for doing that and that I should have kept it for him. I don\u2019t think I was wrong for giving.

You did the right thing by giving the record player to your mom after your ex-boyfriend said he didn't want it and was going to throw it away. You had no reason to believe you would get back together with him at the time, and you had no use for the item. It was within your right to give it to someone who would appreciate it.
