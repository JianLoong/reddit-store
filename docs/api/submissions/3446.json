She says I'm the asshole.\n\nMy (30F) sister (32F) is heavily pregnant, due in 1-2 weeks with her 3rd child (M), and as such is attending regular doctor's appointments 1-2 times a week. I'm part of her birth plan and will be taking 1-2 vacation days and watching her kids while her and her husband are in the hospital when she's giving birth.\n\nShe chose me because she knows our parents, her husband's parents, and our older brother won't respect her wishes about quarantine and safety, and she also asked me to quarantine ahead of time because I can WFH. I spoke with my boss and he agreed. All okay so far.\n\nlast week, with my boss' permission, I started WFH prior to Thanksgiving. I didn't take any vacation because I only get 3 weeks total for the year and needed to save for when she's in the hospital.\n\nShe had an appointment last Tuesday at her Gyno, and needed someone to watch her older 2 kids. Her husband makes good money as a Truck engine mechanic and is working OT currently to get money for the baby and account for lost income while my sister is on FMLA / Maternity leave.

So kiddo stayed with me and did virtual school. Even though kiddo is 10 and pretty independent, he interrupted me a lot needing help or frankly just wanting some attention. Most of my workday is spent in conference calls so each interruption came in the middle of a meeting.

You cannot WFH full time and watch small kids at the same time without it negatively impacting your work. You either will not get things done, or will be working until the late hours of the evening making up for lost time which turns your 8 hour work day into what feels like 14+ hours.\n\nI used to work with someone who requested to WFH full time after maternity leave because she couldn\u2019t find affordable child care. She was told no, so she got mad and quit. Sorry but taking care of an infant (or any young child) is a full time job in itself, how can you possibly expect them to believe you will also get your work done?!?", "Working from home is still working.

If your boss wouldn't appreciate Sis dumping her kids on you for a few hours while you were at your workplace, that would be a no for WFH.\n\nNote that I said that in terms of your boss's opinion...I've read some seriously strange opinions of what is appropriate in the workplace on AITA. (What your Sis thinks is appropriate is irrelevant ... and has she considered that your boss might Zoom, discover that you are babysitting on the clock, and rescind WFH privileges?)\n\nAn emergency is an emergency, but this is not an emergency. \n\nYour boss was not in any way obligated to accommodate your request to WFH. It was a favor. Kind of like you using your limited vacation days to be there for her and arranging WFH to avoid potential exposures prior to the big event was a favor.\n\nWhere I come from, when someone does you a favor, you don't sh!t all over it.

If I agree to something in advance, like taking care of the other kids when you give birth, you can 100% count on me.

I'm a people pleaser and am trying really hard with boundaries with my family\n\nNo doubt they know this and will try to exploit it.", "My 2yo gets up like every day at 7 with the rest of us; we all get ready; at 745 i drop the 7yo off for school; give my 2yo a snack and his milk then he's in the playroom for about 30-45min... completely child proofed and under cameras that I watch while I do my morning things and my AM meeting....I come out check on him; change him; give him BF and tell his drink; set up another preschool program on the TV and head back to work another 45 min or so.... repeat until 11.... he gets lunch then goes down for his nap... he's up about 3; my 7yo gets home about 3; then she plays with him til 5.... the playroom is completely child proof and I've got 7 different cameras in my home to watch them both from most any room.", "My boss always wants camera on for meetings and immediate response times to any zoom meetings / emails / chat messages. Which is understandable.\n\nWhat I found working from home was I didn't need as much vacation time because I get 2 extra hours each day (I save an hour on my commute and I get 1 hour for lunch) which goes a long way to reducing burnout and need for vacation.", "Thanks for the well wishes :)\n\nAnd yeah, her husband got a vasectomy and she's getting her tubes tied after this. I'm guessing they don't want four in 6 years, lol.", "Oh yeah, that's definitely true, lol! I've babysat them (outside of work hours) plenty before and even in her babyproofed house they somehow find something. I once went to the bathroom while babysitting and came back to my nephew drawing all over my niece in marker :,D", "Yeah, and can you imagine the trouble a 3-year-old boy who can open doors can get into? With his 1-year-old sister toddling right behind? I wouldn't be able to work a second as I'd have to constantly keep an eye on them.", "I'll admit...I do sometimes feel kind of used by her. And it upsets me when people with children act like they're more important than those like me without. Being unmarried and childless (and wfh on top of that), it's like my family thinks I have unlimited free time and can drop everything at a whim and come help out. Most of the time I can but...they don't ever seem to realize that it's a favor and it effects my energy and my life.", "I'm impressed! You sound like a great parent and I hope you're blessed with a partner of equal quality :)", "That's exactly it, they're thinking about themselves and seeing you as someone they can tell to do something. Completely unfair. I mean I am definitely projecting my own issues into this too, my bad.\n\nIn the nicest way, to you, somebody else's kids aren't your responsibility and you shouldn't feel bad for saying no. Your time is for you", "I chose to raise both my kids to be pretty independent.... my 7yo is super responsible; does her own laundry can make some foods herself.... she asks to learn extra tasks to earn extra allowance..... so she can buy more crap...lol.... We're all pretty good; my husband is a huge help and not every day is my 2yo so easy.... he has his moments and I have to wait to do the bulk of my work until after 12 when he goes down for his nap.... but it's not often", "Love when people have children they literally cannot care for /s", "You are working. That is the only thing that matters. Your baby proofing, your sister\u2019s stress or importance of her appointments don\u2019t matter because you are working. NTA", "You have to work even at home and you can't do that with kids in the house.Stop it before it starts.", "NTA .. I think you handled it completely right. Her hormones are a little out of whack and she\u2019s nesting and in mommy mode very hard. I think you did well.", "NTA.  What part of WFH says you have free time?  The W stands for WORK, whether you do it at an office or at your home, you are working.  I just don't understand ppl.", "Uhmmm...quarantine?  Why?  It didn't work last time. Your sister is the AH, definitely not you.", "Nta you're literally working.  Would she expect you to take them to the office?  For a teenager, you could make they case that they are self sufficient.  But a 1yo and a 3yo NEED supervision.  \n\nAs for your reliability,  this was sprung last minute.  Also, the fuck is her attitude that you are at all responsible for her kids?  She and hubby chose to have three kids. Ultimately, she and hubby are responsible for those kids.  You see how you aren't on that list?", "NTA. As others have said, you\u2019re going above and beyond for your sibling: \n\n> I'm part of her birth plan and will be taking 1-2 vacation days and watching her kids while her and her husband are in the hospital when she's giving birth.\n\n> she also asked me to quarantine ahead of time because I can WFH. I spoke with my boss and he agreed. All okay so far.\n\n> I understand she is under a large amount of hormones and stress right now, so her reaction was understandable that she panicked, said she was worried about my reliability when she has the baby, etc.\n\nPeople can have unreasonable demands when they\u2019re under stress. *But understand that stress is not the same as emergency.* If she were going into labor (true emergency) or come down with a life threatening condition or accident instead, then yes, the right thing to do would be to watch the kids. But there was no emergency in your case. \n\nAs you just started WFH recently, agree with other commentators on setting boundaries like now. It is not fair to your job nor to the kids, to only give 50/50 of yourself. As a WFH parent myself, I am only able to do it at times because I have older kids who can manage ok for long periods. But a 1 and 3yo, nope. They need a lot of attention and care at that age. I hope she doesn\u2019t try to guilt trip you into babysitting them while you work or talk you into using up all your hard earned vacation days to watch them.\n\nYou are so NTA. You get a sister of the year medal IMO.", "NTA.  When you and your employer set up a WFH situation, there are conditions/rules.  I am pretty sure not doing childcare at the same time is one of them.  Your employer has the right to expect your undivided attention during the work hours agreed upon.  Your sister has no right to expect you to watch her kids while you are WFH.  That is a HUGE lack of respect towards you.  And, for what it is worth, this shows your commitment level.  You are 100% at work when you are working, and would be 100% taking care of her kids around the birth.  I think it is pretty generous that you are taking personal leave to do that.", "NTA, WFH means you're still working.", "Using up her only vacation time for babysitting? Oof", "LOL! It surprised them that no one took vacation when everything was shut down for Covid? Really?", "Never said they were surprised.  But what they seem to think it means that people are getting paid for goofing off at home.  Never mind that all the work is getting done--which is all they should care about.", "To be honest, people DO goof off in WFH. They do it not WFH too... It's a Monday, during working hours, I'd bet there's a higher than 50% of the people here on Reddit are 'goofing off' on the clock!", "I am sorry that this still happens to women, and no, you are NTA! I worked from home as a freelance designer and illustrator for years. I had women neighbors and friends who would call ME, instead of their husbands, when they needed an errand run because they simply could not accept that I was working just like they were working. I had to explain repeatedly that I had deadlines, client meetings in my studio office, all kinds of work issues to handle of my own. So no, I cannot pick your kids up from school when the temp drops to below 10\u00b0 (we were in Alaska), because A. my daughter goes to a different school and it would be out of my way, and B. I make arrangements for someone else to pick my daughter up if I have a client meeting, and C. Your husband works in town\u2014HE can go get them if you can't\u2014his work is not more important than mine. \"But you are already home\u2014meaning not really working\u2014and I can give you gas money if you want...\"", "NTA she can take them with her to get doctor's visit.", "Absolutely NTA. My husband works from home and while he can be in charge of our older kids for a bit while we run errands, I never leave him with my now two year old while he\u2019s working. You\u2019re right, kids that young just need too much attention", "NTA.  Work from home is still working - not sitting around watching TV and eating popcorn.  No way could she do both - work and take care of a 3yr old and a 1yr old.  Wasn't even reasonable to ask - much less get upset when told no.", "NTA  Three children.  Expects you to be available at any time to watch them.  Gets made if you say no.  Trouble is coming your way.", "You\u2019re not alone OP.  My MIL used to be so mad while doing chores when I used to WFH.  She used to bang the vacuum really loudly lol.  Funnily enough when her son ended up WFH she had no expectation on him.", "This is proof that productivity is not really linked to the usual work time at the office 9-5", "I feel seen", "NTA. WFH is not a substitute for daycare.", "Why can't she just take them to her appointments? I have almost always just taken my kids my OB appointments. I was high risk with all of them due to gestational diabetes. So that meant kids anywhere from 16 months with my oldest for the second presidency to a 5, 4, and 2yo with my third had to go twice a week and wait for my fetal non-sress tests. I took a few toys and they played as quiet as kids can. It would have been easier if I  had tablets for them back then. I did research and found a family birthing center that allowed this. I can say it is not fun and easy, but it was necessary for our situation.\n\nNTA", "Some companies actually state in the employment agreement there can be no childcare during WFH hours", ">said she was worried about my reliability when she has the baby, etc.\n\nIts at this point I would start backing away.\n\nForget stress, etc, sounds like you're going above and beyond for her, and she starts pulling this crap?", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nas you told her, you're not on vacation you are working\n\nplus just because you're child free doesn't automatically mean you can or want to take care of other peoples kids, you're child free for a reason! Always put your foot down when people expect child care from you unless its a true emergency", "NTA. Working from home doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not working. You are working.", "NTA.", "Shhhhhhhh don't tell them that, they might think they can take the vacation time away lol", "NTA, you are helping as much as you can. Some Dr offices won't let you bring your other kids which is lame and my wife and I have had to cancel appointments because of this. Also what's with the quarantining, is someone immunocompromised?", "NTA\u2026your job is already accommodating her by letting you wfh for her benefit.  Does she realize working from home is still WORKING?", "NTA.\n\nWhich part of \"work\" is causing her issues?", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA... people dont understand the WFH means you are working", "I only have so much sympathy for her - she decided to have 2 kids after the onset of the pandemic, and she has some pretty rigid requirements for doing her a favor by watching her kids. It\u2019s not really anyone\u2019s responsibility but her husband\u2019s to reorganize their life to meet her needs and standards. She instead should be appreciative for the days you are willing to put your own life on hold and watch her kids. Her \u201cwants\u201d don\u2019t supersede others\u2019 jobs and personal lives.", "The leading causes of death in young children are injuries and accidents, they are much more likely to be hurt or killed in this situation than in the chance they are taking being exposed to the flu or Covid. Rest assured you are actually acting in their best interests.", "I mean, there\u2019s also the fact that there wasn\u2019t anywhere good to take a vacation for most of 2020. If you\u2019re just sitting around the house bored, may as well work and not burn vacation days.", "Why the emphasis on a quarantine?  Are you in China?", "OMFG LOL", "I would've thought that one thing the pandemic taught us is that WFH is STILL WORKING!!!", "You're NTA for sure, you can't watch two toddlers while working from home, but I think other comments are a bit harsh about your sister. It's really scary to have small children or be pregnant right now with the RSV/flu/Covid triple crisis -- I'm about as far along as your sister and I feel more than halfway out of my mind all the time right now. \n\nDefinitely hold your boundaries, but I think it's very kind that you're giving her some grace. It sounds like you two have a generally good relationship and she's clearly under a lot of stress."]}
