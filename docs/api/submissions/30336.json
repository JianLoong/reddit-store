Obviously a throwaway for privacy, also am new to posting so I hope I do this correctly!\n\nWhen I was 18, my dad gifted me a house with two stories. I am extremely thankful, we are not upper class but my dad bought this house for a cheap price a long time ago (it was his grandmothers cousin's house). I know that this was an extreme privilege and I am forever grateful for this. \n\nThe layout of this building is like an apartment, but it is a house. So basically, each story has its own separate entry, its own kitchen and bathroom. I live upstairs while I rent out the downstairs. My boyfriend 25m moved in with me about three months ago and we have been together for six months. I have not asked him for money, neither for utilities or to pay me any rent. The only thing he contributes to is groceries, that we split 50/50. I have not brought up that I own the building as it is not something I tell many people, if people ask me I of course tell them that I own it, but if they just assume I am a renter then they can believe that. The topic of a landlord, the renter downstairs or the owner of the building has not been something we have talked about. \n\nThis last Tuesday the renter came up to tell me that her freezer has stopped working. I answered the door and my boyfriend heard us talking I suppose. I went downstairs to take a look and we came to the conclusion that she would buy a new one, send me the receipt and I would give her the money. She was very grateful for this solution.\n\nWhen I went upstairs my boyfriend asked if it could be fixed, I told him no, but she was going to buy a new one and I would pay for it. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked me why the hell I would pay for her freezer, I told him that because I am her landlord and the freezer was there when she started renting, I would stand for the cost. He just asked me if I was serious, to which I said I was. He begun screaming at me, asking him why the hell I would hold this information from him and that I was an evil person. I said I was sorry for not telling him but I did not think that it would matter. He said he could not believe he was together with someone who is a landlord, that all of us just use people for money and that the only thing \u201cwe people\u201d care about is money and would rather have people be homeless then offering affordable rent. (The downstairs is 1 kitchen, 1 bath and 4 other rooms, I charge 500 dollars in rent). I understand many people have had trouble with landlords, but I try my best to be a good one. He demanded that I give him 50% of the money I make from rent or else I was just as bad as he thought.\n\nWas I really the asshole for not telling him?

He must not have offered to pay half of the rent, because then it would have come up and you would have told him, right? He is living with you rent-free.

You owe him a kick in the rear.", "NTA, but you will be to yourself if you give in to his manipulative demand to give him 50% of what you make from the rent.

Why would you want to date and live with someone like that? NTA but get rid of this guy if he actually exists.", "NTA. He showed his true colors at \"give me half the money or you're just as bad as any other landlord\". If he actually thought you renting out the lower half of the building was morally reprehensible, the ultimatum would be \"stop charging the person downstairs rent\" or \"offer to sell the downstairs unit to them\" or even \"donate the profit to charities that help people secure stable housing\". But no, he only actually cares that he didn't know about this stream of income, and now he wants in.", "When I saw his reaction, I thought I must have misread. NTA. He is not the one.

He lives with you rent free and utility free and is now demanding you pay him half of your rental income?? Pay him for what exactly?? You need to get rid of him fast!\n\nYou sound like a good and fair landlord, not someone trying to take advantage of others.", "Your boyfriend apparently was okay with not paying or even discussing rent with you. Then when he finds out you own the place and have a tenant he calls you evil for taking money from someone else so that they can live there. Then to top it all off he demands you basically make him co-landlord so he can get free money.\n\nIdk why you're this naive to think any of this makes you an AH.\n\nI know people can get too caught up in their own drama to see clearly but the reaction of the boyfriend is so obnoxious it's quite literally difficult to see this story being real.

You can do better. \n\nNTA", "NTA, any trace of AH you may have had for not disclosing this is wiped away by his \"gimme half or else\".

I'd rather you be homeless than give you an affordable rent of 0, which is what you currently pay.\n\nAnd Kick him out!! NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut your boyfriend is one. He is not entitled to anything that you make from renting this property out. I suspect you never told him, because really, it's none of his business.  Landlords are not evil. It doesn't sound like you are getting rich, and even if you were - tough noogies. It's called the Real World, and someone is always making money off of you. Literally everyone pays for where they live - be it in rent or mortgage - but you were blessed with a gift... that benefited him as well (with him no contributing to anything other than groceries).\n\nI suggest he be shown the door - because is is an ungrateful fool filled with far too much self-righteousness.", "NTA\n\nI'm a landlord. We rent at below market rate, we never raise anyone's rent (though we've lowered it,lol), we allow multiple pets, fix everything more quickly than in our own home, and try really hard to be the landlords we wanted. Small, 1-2 property landlords aren't causing rents to skyrocket. And, for better or worse, no one's reappropriating rental units to hand out for free. This is the system we live in, all we can do is try to do a little good where we can.\n\nYour BF is making a money grab. You've been letting him live there rent free and he **never** questioned it. That's bizarre. Now he wants you to give him cash or you're \"evil\". What happens when taxes are due? The place needs a new roof? A pipe bursts? Does he want to sign an agreement that he's responsible for 50% of the cost? Since he took money you should be saving for things just like that?\n\nThis guy has told you who he is. Believe him. Now be *very* careful evicting him. Like, talk to an attorney first so it's all legal. It doesn't matter how he sees you or what he calls you. Him refusing to leave is the danger. You need him gone.", "Pah. He\u2019s a jerk. He hasn\u2019t paid rent - just groceries. \n\nWho did he think was paying the rent for him then?

Why do you have to pay to convince him that you're not some random stereotype he accused you of being? He's already getting to live rent for himself, and now he wants to penalize you for giving somebody else a place to live? $500 a month seems low to me as it is. Nothing he said makes sense. Even without a mortgage, buildings come with a cost for maintenance, and there's usually property tax.\n\nYou might want to take a hard look at what he is bringing to this relationship.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  And your boyfriend needs a new landlord immediately...one who charges him way too much rent!", "Bruh, I was almost on his side for not liking landlords and not wanting to be in a relationship with one right up until he asked for 50% of the rent on your property. There is a line and he crossed it multiple times there. You are NTA.", "wtf. NTA. \"Landlords are bad! That's why I live with you rent free! Give me half your tenant's rent because having a tenant is bad!\u201d That's some phenomenal logic right there.\n\nHow did you guys move in together and not talk about rent, though? Is it a common pattern for him to assume you will provide for him? Do you often pay for things for him? Some things for you to think about.", "Ex-bf, yes?\nThrow him out, and change the locks. \n\nNTA.", "RUNNNN!!!", "ahahahahaha... your boyfriend is the asshole.  It is none of his business and, frankly, I wouldn't have told him too.  \n\nI find it interesting that your boyfriend, who is so horrified by dating and living with an evil landlord such as yourself has not only not moved out - taking advantage of that rent free lifestyle, but demands \"his share\" of your ill gotten gains.  \n\nThis has to be a chat gpt story, right?  It can't be real...\ud83e\udd23", "NTA for not telling him this, and for someone who despises landlords as much as he says, his principles are clearly for sale, so he's a massive AH.", "WOW.  NTA.\n\nHow can he demand something that is YOURS?  Very strange indeed! Doesn't sound like much of a BF to me.\n\nBTW...  It's NO ONE's business what you own until you choose to make it their business.  \n\nBefore you get married, be sure and make sure that you are legally safe that the things you have before the marriage STAY YOURS 100% if the marriage dissolves!\n\nSince you have something of great value, it would be wise to NOT tell ANYONE that you own unless you're getting married and already the engagement ring is on.", "Most definitely, NTA.  You\u2019re not even charging **him** rent.  Moreover, he moved in after *only 3 months*!  And he\u2019s demanding half of what you get in rent for the other apartment?  Talk about just using someone for money,  Major red flags there.", "NTA Given his reaction this can\u2019t have been the first red flag? Well second actually since he didn\u2019t offer to pay half the rent when he moved in so the convo could be had of your living situation? You deserve better\u2026 absolutely hypocritical of him to say he hates landlords for being money grabbers then request half the money\u2026 which he is absolutely not entitled to.", "NTA  \nGet rid of him immediately. He's happy enough to live in a place rent free when he thought you were paying rent? And now he want's half your tainted evil rental money?\n\nEither he's a greedy hypocrite or he has serious cognitive issues.

NTA and he should be an ex now.", "Boyfriend of 6 MONTHS (?!?) moved in with you. Doesn't pay rent. Doesn't pay for utilities. And goes halfies with you on groceries. And now wants half of your rental income?!? \n\nAnd he's accusing you of using people for money? He's the moocher in this relationship. He's the big user. \n\nGirl, you're better than this! Maybe use some of that rental income to get a therapist if this is how lowly you think of yourself. \n\nKick him out. Change the locks. End the relationship.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "so u paid all the bills and not charge him rent and he pays a bit o f grocery bill yet he has the nerve to ask for half the money?  he sounds like a real moocheroo.", "Hahahahahahahaha half of the rent?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 What a loser. \nNTA, obviously.", "NTA. Kick him out. It's one thing to live happily for free, but demanding half of the rent you collect is WAY out of line. Find a better boyfriend.", "NTA.\n\nDitch that man today.\n\nHe has no problem living with you rent free, never thought to help with paying rent nor utilities, but does not like landlords.\n\nHe is toxic.", "NTA. He was happy to live in a place rent free, but now that he knows you own it, he has a problem? \n\nWhat do you have to be sorry for? And what on earth entitles him to any money? Time to boot him and change the locks.\n\nThis very much sounds like the kind of guy who was expecting to start asserting some control over you and is now shocked at how badly he misjudged the situation.", "NTA but he sure is. I can understand why you don\u2019t tell people. But to say those things to you after you were nice to your renter blows my mind.", "Sweetie, You are NTA. \nGet rid of that toxic boy child. That's what I would have said even without knowing you owned the building. Any person that would move in and not even offer to pay half the rent and utilities is trouble you do not need. \nI respect landlords that take care of their tenants. That you keep the rent affordable is a blessing to your renters. In 2yrs mine went from 625 to 900. So, thank you for your kindness.\nThat boy child demanding half of the rent is a problem. One of the others mentioned that you need to talk to a lawyer & I agree with that.

He was ok thinking that you were paying rent. He knows you are paying utilities, and he was 100% ok using you. \nYou need to ask yourself why it was ok for him to take advantage of your goodwill. Don't get me wrong, I have done similar things and still had to learn the hard way. \nYou are worth more, expect more from people. Good luck getting rid of this child, be safe.", "This seems artificial. He immediately started screaming about hating landlords and then demanded half the rent money? That isn't a logical train of thought even when someone is upset.", "If he takes half the rent from downstairs, doesn\u2019t that make him\u2026. A LANDLORD?", "NTA. Honestly, I think you need to be an AH in this situation and just laugh at him.

NTA.  how has he been living?  is he a squatter or something?\n\nwait, why is he demanding money from you?  he didn\u2019t give you any rent?  and how is your passive income are somehow his?   this dude sounds like serious bad news.  like multiple gigantic red flags bad news.  if you value your life, i would kick him out.", "NTA, but he is. You need to dump him, seriously! He doesn\u2019t pay for his share of the utilities, but he pays for half the groceries.

For someone demanding half of the rent you receive he\u2019s not offered to pay any, so he\u2019s living with only half the grocery costs to cover.

Like his particular reaction is absolutely OTT, don't get me wrong, demanding money from you is ridiculous, you should be done with his ass completely, and my judgement isn't in any way to do with you being a landlord... but hiding from him such a significant bit of information about the living situation while moving him in with you is also shitty.

I'm sorry but he is an entitled tool. Sure landlords can be scummy. Maybe even most of them are. But he should know that you are not like that. It's not like you're some rich property owner who's preying on desperate people. You own one house with an extra unit that you rent out for next to nothing AND are letting him live with you rent free. You owe this idiot NOTHING.

Does he\u2019s entitled to half of the rent that you charge she can pay half of all of that as well. \n\nWhat his screaming was covering up was the loud crack of his ego. The fact that he has given you the silent treatment for going on five days, after **screaming** at you tells you everything you need to know. That and the entitlement to half of the $500 like WTF?!  I made a mention about this in another comment that this is just the beginning.  He will never get over the fact that you own a building and that you are a landlord.
