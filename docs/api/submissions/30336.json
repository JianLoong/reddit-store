Obviously a throwaway for privacy, also am new to posting so I hope I do this correctly!\n\nWhen I was 18, my dad gifted me a house with two stories. I am extremely thankful, we are not upper class but my dad bought this house for a cheap price a long time ago (it was his grandmothers cousin's house). I know that this was an extreme privilege and I am forever grateful for this. \n\nThe layout of this building is like an apartment, but it is a house. So basically, each story has its own separate entry, its own kitchen and bathroom. I live upstairs while I rent out the downstairs. My boyfriend 25m moved in with me about three months ago and we have been together for six months. I have not asked him for money, neither for utilities or to pay me any rent. The only thing he contributes to is groceries, that we split 50/50. I have not brought up that I own the building as it is not something I tell many people, if people ask me I of course tell them that I own it, but if they just assume I am a renter then they can believe that. The topic of a landlord, the renter downstairs or the owner of the building has not been something we have talked about. \n\nThis last Tuesday the renter came up to tell me that her freezer has stopped working. I answered the door and my boyfriend heard us talking I suppose. I went downstairs to take a look and we came to the conclusion that she would buy a new one, send me the receipt and I would give her the money. She was very grateful for this solution.\n\nWhen I went upstairs my boyfriend asked if it could be fixed, I told him no, but she was going to buy a new one and I would pay for it. He looked at me like I was crazy and asked me why the hell I would pay for her freezer, I told him that because I am her landlord and the freezer was there when she started renting, I would stand for the cost. He just asked me if I was serious, to which I said I was. He begun screaming at me, asking him why the hell I would hold this information from him and that I was an evil person. I said I was sorry for not telling him but I did not think that it would matter. He said he could not believe he was together with someone who is a landlord, that all of us just use people for money and that the only thing \u201cwe people\u201d care about is money and would rather have people be homeless then offering affordable rent. (The downstairs is 1 kitchen, 1 bath and 4 other rooms, I charge 500 dollars in rent). I understand many people have had trouble with landlords, but I try my best to be a good one. He demanded that I give him 50% of the money I make from rent or else I was just as bad as he thought.\n\nWas I really the asshole for not telling him? He has not talked to me since Tuesday and I have tried telling him that I am truly sorry but he doesn\u2019t answer me at all.\n\nEdit: obligatory edit to add that I certainly did not expect this to blow up the way it did, I have tried to read as much as I can. Thank you all for your advice and support, I have talked with him and I will update later tonight when I had have time to process everything that went down and try to write it out as best as I can. For the people who was worried about my safety, I called my dad who was sat outside in his car when I talked with my boyfriend and I am safe as of right now and hope it will continue that way. Thanks yet again to everyone\n\nEdit 2: update posted, sorry for the rushed update and weird writing, it is explained in my update as to why.

He showed his true colors at \"give me half the money or you're just as bad as any other landlord\". If he actually thought you renting out the lower half of the building was morally reprehensible, the ultimatum would be \"stop charging the person downstairs rent\" or \"offer to sell the downstairs unit to them\" or even \"donate the profit to charities that help people secure stable housing\".

Then when he finds out you own the place and have a tenant he calls you evil for taking money from someone else so that they can live there. Then to top it all off he demands you basically make him co-landlord so he can get free money.\n\nIdk why you're this naive to think any of this makes you an AH.\n\nI know people can get too caught up in their own drama to see clearly but the reaction of the boyfriend is so obnoxious it's quite literally difficult to see this story being real.

You can do better. \n\nNTA", "NTA, any trace of AH you may have had for not disclosing this is wiped away by his \"gimme half or else\".

I'd rather you be homeless than give you an affordable rent of 0, which is what you currently pay.\n\nAnd Kick him out!! NTA.", "NTA\n\nBut your boyfriend is one. He is not entitled to anything that you make from renting this property out. I suspect you never told him, because really, it's none of his business.  Landlords are not evil. It doesn't sound like you are getting rich, and even if you were - tough noogies. It's called the Real World, and someone is always making money off of you. Literally everyone pays for where they live - be it in rent or mortgage - but you were blessed with a gift... that benefited him as well (with him no contributing to anything other than groceries).\n\nI suggest he be shown the door - because is is an ungrateful fool filled with far too much self-righteousness.", "NTA\n\nI'm a landlord. We rent at below market rate, we never raise anyone's rent (though we've lowered it,lol), we allow multiple pets, fix everything more quickly than in our own home, and try really hard to be the landlords we wanted. Small, 1-2 property landlords aren't causing rents to skyrocket. And, for better or worse, no one's reappropriating rental units to hand out for free. This is the system we live in, all we can do is try to do a little good where we can.\n\nYour BF is making a money grab. You've been letting him live there rent free and he **never** questioned it. That's bizarre. Now he wants you to give him cash or you're \"evil\". What happens when taxes are due? The place needs a new roof? A pipe bursts? Does he want to sign an agreement that he's responsible for 50% of the cost? Since he took money you should be saving for things just like that?\n\nThis guy has told you who he is. Believe him. Now be *very* careful evicting him. Like, talk to an attorney first so it's all legal. It doesn't matter how he sees you or what he calls you. Him refusing to leave is the danger.

He's already getting to live rent for himself, and now he wants to penalize you for giving somebody else a place to live? $500 a month seems low to me as it is. Nothing he said makes sense. Even without a mortgage, buildings come with a cost for maintenance, and there's usually property tax.\n\nYou might want to take a hard look at what he is bringing to this relationship.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  And your boyfriend needs a new landlord immediately...one who charges him way too much rent!", "Bruh, I was almost on his side for not liking landlords and not wanting to be in a relationship with one right up until he asked for 50% of the rent on your property. There is a line and he crossed it multiple times there. You are NTA.", "wtf. NTA. \"Landlords are bad! That's why I live with you rent free! Give me half your tenant's rent because having a tenant is bad!\u201d That's some phenomenal logic right there.\n\nHow did you guys move in together and not talk about rent, though?

Some things for you to think about.", "Ex-bf, yes?\nThrow him out, and change the locks. \n\nNTA.", "RUNNNN!!!", "ahahahahaha... your boyfriend is the asshole.  It is none of his business and, frankly, I wouldn't have told him too.  \n\nI find it interesting that your boyfriend, who is so horrified by dating and living with an evil landlord such as yourself has not only not moved out - taking advantage of that rent free lifestyle, but demands \"his share\" of your ill gotten gains.  \n\nThis has to be a chat gpt story, right?  It can't be real...\ud83e\udd23", "NTA for not telling him this, and for someone who despises landlords as much as he says, his principles are clearly for sale, so he's a massive AH.", "WOW.  NTA.\n\nHow can he demand something that is YOURS?  Very strange indeed! Doesn't sound like much of a BF to me.\n\nBTW...  It's NO ONE's business what you own until you choose to make it their business.  \n\nBefore you get married, be sure and make sure that you are legally safe that the things you have before the marriage STAY YOURS 100% if the marriage dissolves!\n\nSince you have something of great value, it would be wise to NOT tell ANYONE that you own unless you're getting married and already the engagement ring is on.", "Most definitely, NTA.  You\u2019re not even charging **him** rent.  Moreover, he moved in after *only 3 months*!  And he\u2019s demanding half of what you get in rent for the other apartment?

End the relationship.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "so u paid all the bills and not charge him rent and he pays a bit o f grocery bill yet he has the nerve to ask for half the money?  he sounds like a real moocheroo.", "Hahahahahahahaha half of the rent?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 What a loser. \nNTA, obviously.", "NTA. Kick him out. It's one thing to live happily for free, but demanding half of the rent you collect is WAY out of line.

He was happy to live in a place rent free, but now that he knows you own it, he has a problem? \n\nWhat do you have to be sorry for? And what on earth entitles him to any money?

I can understand why you don\u2019t tell people. But to say those things to you after you were nice to your renter blows my mind.", "Sweetie, You are NTA. \nGet rid of that toxic boy child. That's what I would have said even without knowing you owned the building. Any person that would move in and not even offer to pay half the rent and utilities is trouble you do not need. \nI respect landlords that take care of their tenants. That you keep the rent affordable is a blessing to your renters. In 2yrs mine went from 625 to 900. So, thank you for your kindness.\nThat boy child demanding half of the rent is a problem.

There are several reasons why it may be a bad idea to use self-help eviction to remove a guest from your home.\n\nYou may be risking your personal safety if the guest becomes angry or violent during or after the eviction.\n\nIf the police need to be called because the eviction is causing a disturbance, they may stop the eviction and direct you to let the guest move back into your home. The police may also direct you to go to court to evict the guest.\n\nIn many cases, you cannot be sure whether a person is a guest or a tenant. If you are wrong and a judge decides that your guest actually is a tenant, you may be ordered to let that person move back into your home and you might have to pay that person money for wrongfully evicting him or her.\n\nJudgments for wrongful eviction can be a large amount of money and can include: reimbursement for living costs while the guest was out of the property, lost or stolen personal property, pain and suffering, and, if the tenant can prove that you acted recklessly or maliciously, additional damages to punish you for the illegal eviction.\n\nYou can protect yourself from these problems by using the court process to evict your guest.\n\n[Source:](https://www.lawhelp.org/dc/resource/frequently-asked-questions-evicting-guests-roommates-family-members-and-other-unwanted-occupants-from-your-home)", "This.

In what planet is it your fault that he wants a free ride and didn\u2019t bother to find out how much you pay for rent?", "NTA but you need to break up with him and have him move out ASAP. I would recommend changing the lock and breaking up with him outside the home so he doesn't swat or do any damage.\n\nHe moved in and hasn't offered to pay half the rent. The conversation would have come up if he had. And now he's gaslighting you AND damaging half of your \"profits\". WTF\n\nThat rent goes towards upkeep, gas, water, etc. all the things he's getting for free. You need to leave him. It's been 6 months, he has shown you his true colors.", "He called you an evil person because you didn\u2019t mention the person living underneath you is your tenant? Then immediately asked for a slice (half actually!) of the pie, while he hasn\u2019t paid rent ever? \n\nGirl, you need to ditch this fool sooner rather than later.", "This is all about your bf's ego.  He thought he was F'n you so good that you decided to not charge him rent.", "NTA he gets free rent and feels entitled to half the downstairs rent? Wtf?", "NTA! You are being more than generous by allowing him to live with you completely free. I cannot believe the audacity this man has to disrespect you like that. It\u2019s amazing that you own a property and have this investment! If my husband had something like this I would be so proud and happy for him! Dump his ass..", "NTA \nWhy on earth should you give him any of your rental income?\nWhy isn't he contributing towards housing costs?\nWhat a taker. \n He is like a rental pimp.", "Posted an update if anyone is interested. Sorry if it is lacking or seems rushed, but it truly was. Thanks everyone", "I really hate the \"Leave him\" people but today they can fill their boots as it's totally justified", "Yeah it\u2019s because this didn\u2019t happen and OP is living out some kind of fantasy in their head.", "i mean ya but i assume its fake from the 4bedroom house for $500 lol", "Not to mention that he was asking why she would eat a cost as landlord instead of trying to fix it. Hypocritical to say the least.", "the bad creative storytelling sub", "This story doesn't make sense at all.", "Very low-effort rage-bait.", "Totally lol. Paints the most ridiculously asshole of a boyfriend and asks Am I the Asshole. If this post wasn't on this sub, I might have believed it.", "I also do not think this post is real. Where would a landlord charge $500 for a kitchen and bath and \u2018four other rooms\u2019? Would that even cover taxes on the building for the year? Landlord advocacy groups often try to make small landlords the face of their lobbying. I think the person who wrote this maybe confused a (possibly realistic) $500 per room figure with $500 for a whole apartment. They\u2019ll fix it next time and this thing will rocket to the top of r/all. Or maybe this landlord is outside the US, it\u2019s not dollars, and not native English speaker", "I would be careful telling him \u201cI\u2019ll keep your half for utilities\u201d because that may bite her if this has to go to court. Never allude to the fact that he gets half.", "No kidding lol \"i'm such a nice landlord i have one tenant and barely charge them rent...i would give them money if they'd accept it! (they're such a good tenant, more tenants should be like this)...their fridge broke and so i gave them a blank check to go buy a fridge...my deadbeat boyfriend that doesn't pay rent freaked out at me because i'm a landlord and he thinks i'm evil!!! and now he's extorting me?? i'm such a good person though!!! i'm definitely not a slum lord creating a super fake scenario as a strawman against people that think multiple property ownership is immoral\"\n\nThe only thing missing here is a land acknowledgement. Every day on this site brings me one step closer to thinking Mao was right.", "I would too! Oh, what's this about rent?", "This guy will take half her shit and contribute 0.  He just admitted it and is gaslighting her.  He expects you to pay for everything and expects a cut as well?  Are you his property OP? This man is batshit insane and selfish", "Especially now that he found out she owns not only the apparment they've been living in, but is also a landlord. He's clearly a cheap manipulative money hungry AH and he probably won't leave easily now that he smelled the money.", "right, and don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s a 4 bedroom house with a whole additional house on the second floor, and her dad just happened to get it for cheap because it belonged to grandma\u2019s cousin!", "NTA. Kick him to the curb. If I were him, I\u2019d honestly be thrilled to learn my significant other owned a whole fricken building. You can do so much better than this.\n\nAnd also\u2026landlords aren\u2019t all evil. My old landlord was a recently widowed dude who moved back in with his parents so they could help with the kids. He needed to rent the place because he couldn\u2019t afford the mortgage without his wife\u2019s income. All sorts of people end up as landlords through a wide variety of situations. Painting any group of people with such a wide brush is stupid. Your boyfriend isn\u2019t just an a-home\u2026he isn\u2019t very smart!", "Plays off so many reddit stereotypes too.", "Manipulation yes, gaslighting no.", "He didn't just get upset, he started screaming. A man who starts screaming so early on in the relationship will be full on abusive later. Also, no one should have to put up with a screaming partner, especially if hes screaming for complete BS reasons", "Only if it's required. In some places you only have to give like 2 weeks and this doucecannoe doesn't deserve any additional time. And, if he yells at or gets aggressive with her again she needs to call the non-emergency number to local police or sherrifs office and have him thrown out immediately (boarders can be removed without notice in many areas if they are considered a threat to the home owner or other tenants safety, and she has witnesses she's screamed at her before because her tenants downstairs would have heard that).", "This point is so important. Her father likely gave her this asset so she could be independent and self sufficient to not have to put up with bullshit like this!", "Change the locks. I'd change all the locks in your units. I'd also take the opportunity to mention it softly to your tenants to keep a look out for this gentlemen and to call you if they see him loitering around. He might be unhinged enough to try and get your tenants to \"turn\" on you... try to expose you for being so evil (a.k.a. lies...) If you don't already have cameras, at least install ring doorbells on your units so you have some sense of security. And when it's time for your tenants to pay you rent... don't keep cash in your house. He's been free loading off of you, he's about to have a reality check. It might get weird. He's targeted you as the enemy. He'll justify some nasty behaviors if things get rough.\n\nBTW I think you sound like a lovely landlord.", "I'm sorry Honey, but you don't have a relationship. You have picked up a PARASITE! You are being taken advantage of and it will only get worse. Sounds like he will soon be unemployed and you will be his sole source of everything. Do you want a bf or do you want an expensive, ungrateful and abusive pet? You deserve to treat yourself better than this.", "Everyone is right that you're NTA,\n\nBut three months is too soon to let a boyfriend move in, especially rent free. Maybe a good rule of thumb is that if it's too soon to share important aspects of your life, like that you're a landlord and own your building, it's too soon to let him move in with you to that building.", "If the obvious answer wasn't \"break up and throw him out\", OP could get sassy and say \"fine, I'll give you 50% of my rental income, but I'm also going to start charging you $500 rent for living here. So I'll have $1000 income, you get $500 of that and break even.\"", "He may be a male, but by no means is he a man!", "I despise professional landlords/slumlords as much as the next reasonable person. OP isn\u2019t it. They\u2019re reasonable with their rent and replacing broken stuff. Seems to me that rather than having a tenant cover two mortgages, property taxes, insurance, and a net profit, OP simply is getting enough to maybe cover just property taxes to keep the home.", "foregone in Ohbyeyo  \n*why?!*", "She was NTA.  But if she stays with him she is definitely TAH"]}
