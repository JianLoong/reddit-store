It's a lot safer to back into a spot than backing out of a spot.

Not at all.", "NTA - no offense to your Dad, but he sounds like he lets people push him around if that is how he is going to act...that girl acting that way was not mistake.

You didn\u2019t ruin her life. There are repercussions to decisions we make and that chick attacked you. Your father is out of line.", "NTA. People who think like your dad are a huge part of the reason people like this girl feel free to behave the way they do. Had you responded to her basically assaulting you by taking one of those books and smacking her with it, people would instantly admit that was not ok. Neither was her behavior, and it  have consequences, so you going to Safety to report her is completely warranted.", "She chased you to class and assaulted you. Great dad you got there.

The majority here sound thankful you've kept a potentially irrational dentist from subjecting patients to unneeded distress.", "NTA. This is not a normal response and the school should be aware of who is doing things like this on their property. They could be held liable if they ignore it and honestly, she sounds like she needs some help.

She will do that and worse any time she wants. Seems she was not unversed in doing it, either. Rather old hat in fact. She deserves no breaks.", "Your the asshole.

It happens all the time. You never know if you're setting somebody off who is armed and could just decide to pull the trigger or even just break check you resulting in an accident.\n\nIt's not worth it. We have to spend so much of our lives driving, at least in the states where I live. If you can't get over a couple frustrating moments in traffic everyday not only will you have a much more angry stressful commute everyday but you are seriously increasing your chances of causing harm to yourself and others.\n\nEven worse sometimes that can result in innocent bystanders/drivers being caught in the crossfire. You're driving a two ton death machine. Treat it with the respect it deserves.\n\nEdit: Not to even mention the assault!

It is a one way for through traffic, but backing into the spot is fine.", "Had she just passed that spot or did she back all the way down the row", "Losing her temper and yelling at you in the parking lot was a mistake, walking up to you after the fact and striking you/your belongings was done with intent.\n\nYou have done the right thing, people like her should not be allowed into positions where they\u2019re responsible for the wellbeing of others.

Unless, of course, you were shocked by her aggression and smacked her in self defense. [Blinks innocently]", "One way rows are usually angled in my experience, so backing in isn't expected or necessarily safer in that case... although it could have been a one way row with the normal perpendicular spots,  I suppose (in which case yeah, backing in is generally safer - but its also normally really obvious when someone is angling themselves to do that)", "I agree that her reaction wasn\u2019t justified, but it seems that she was in fact at the spot first. She had tried to back into the spot (totally valid even in a one way) and OP drove into the spot during said process.\n\nEdit wasn\u2019t not was", "No", "This is a quality that will serve you well throughout your life...and may possibly save it (hopefully not!). You're right that its probably not the first time she's done something like this and being held to consequences might inspire her to either get help for her issues or to change her behavior.  I would've been worried for my car as well, as its the most precious thing to me and I cannot afford to cover costs if someone were to damage it. Keying I wouldn't care about since my car is old and dinged up, but with her level of anger and assaulting, I would fear she would slash tires, break windows, pour sugar in the gas tank, cut brake lines, or something else that's destructive, expensive and dangerous.\n\nTell your dad that he can make his own decisions when he's in situations like this, and that unless he's willing to pony up when you \"let things go\" and the person causes damage of any kind, you're not willing to take such risks. \n\nAlso, as someone who has had, and likely will have more, extensive dental work, thank you for what you did. Dental work is bad enough even with great people, painful when great people make mistakes (I'm fine when it does happen, NBD), and traumatizing and perhaps disfiguring if a bad person lets their rage issues get in the way of functioning as an adult.", "Nope your dad is wrong and you're NTA.", "NTA.

Whhhhyyyyy do people jump to \u2018oh, don\u2019t ruin their life because of a mistake\u2019? Sure. Maybe it was a mistake. But if your \u2018mistakes\u2019 take the form of weirdly aggressive possessiveness over a parking space, leading to slapping someone\u2019s belongings out of their hands, then you genuinely need to be working on anger management and improved self control. Imagine if a 6ft, bearded, tattooed biker did that. Would anyone be saying \u2018oh, don\u2019t make a fuss\u2018? No, and rightfully so - because that level of inability to control your emotions over an extremely minor problem is problematic.", "NTA, your dad is wrong and you were in the right.", "NTA.
