I went to school early so I made sure to be on time. The lot in a one way and someone pulled out so I pulled in. I get out of my car to a girl holding down her horn. She said \u201cdid you not hear me honk?\u201d I said I do now. She told me I stole her spot and don\u2019t act intentionally blind and to move now. I told her I did not see her and it\u2019s a one way, you\u2019re not really supposed to back into spots. She goes \u201cwell move\u201d. I told her there\u2019s tons of spots and I would have moved I don\u2019t like the way she approached me over it. \n\nShe started getting more and more aggressive so I told her I\u2019m taking a picture of her license plate. She said get me in the photo too. I said that\u2019s unnecessary. I then said I\u2019m videoing my car in case she tries to key it. She then took out her phone and recorded me saying \u201cthis is a bitch who steals peoples spots\u201d. I said \u201cbe a nicer person next time and leave. \n\nI walk to the building and I take out my phone to call my friend to vent. The girl walks up to me (got a parking spot right away!!) and hits my books and water bottle out of my hand. \n\nI went to class and was MAD she tried to intimidate and bully me. I then decided to go to Public safety and report her. She knocked things out of my hand in front of a camera. \n\nThey were able to ID her and she was in a dental hygienist program that is VERY competitive. They said student conduct is big and they are taking this very seriously. I said I\u2019m nervous of my car getting keyed.\n\nI called my dad and he told me I was wrong. That just because I was hurt I didn\u2019t need to try to ruin someone\u2019s life, we all make mistakes. \n\nAITA for going to Public safety for road rage?", "created_utc": 1694021396, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bqc20/aita_for_going_to_public_safety_over_someone_mad/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did the right thing. Actions have consequences. Her reaction to losing a parking spot was absolutely unhinged. She physically assaulted you and called you names. Going to public safety was for your own protection.

FAFO", "Nta you were not wrong.  Parking spots are first come first serve.  She verbally and physically assaulted you.  You may have just saved the next person she interacts with. Your dad is wrong.  Never fold for a bully.  It just entitles them to bully someone else. If not stopped who knows what she would do to the next person.  If her behavior causes her problems in school that is on her. Not you!  Good job standing up to a bully.  If I was your parent I would be very proud of you!", "Depends of what you mean stole. Was the specific spot assigned to her ?? If yes YTA as you trigger the action. \nIf the spot wasn't assigned then NTA.", "NTA, you were assaulted. I am a dental hygiene graduate, and someone who acts like that is not fit for public service. To be a DH you have to have a clean background check, and you learn to uphold certain values....there is a lot of legality to it. You did the world a service and are protecting yourself at the same time.", "Yeah big NTA, people think they can behave like this because people usually roll over and let them instead of reporting it. This wasn\u2019t an accident, this was someone being deliberately aggressive over practically nothing, her attitude is what got her in trouble. You did the right thing, she needs to learn her actions have consequences.", "This is the one!\n\nNTA, You father is wrong here, she is a live wire, and no one needs to have her near them in any health-related field.  You protected yourself and did nothing wrong.  Don't feel bad for anyone who thinks it's ok to hit books out of your hands and bully you like this.   Keep recording things like this.", "Exactly! All of this!!", "Right? Being confrontational in the parking lot was a mistake. Knocking your books out of your hands & escalating to assault is very serious and she deserved to be reported.  She needs to be monitored. NTA", "I was sooo scared for my car!!! I still am which is why I reported it. I have a new car and spent a lot of money on it. If someone keyed it over something so minor I\u2019d be soooo upset. I recorded her talking to me and everything lol. Public safety handled it so well and they gave me their # if I wanted someone to walk me to class everyday or if I saw her and felt unsafe. They said me having this on file will protect me", "Yeah plus it\u2019s a one way so I wasn\u2019t looking for someone to be backing into a spot!! There were so many other spots I would of moved! Literally if she came at me nice I would of apologized and moved!!", "He said that we all let anger get the best of us and she can be kicked out of her program just because she made a small mistake and I should just forgive her.

It will protect you in case you try something in the future. You did the right thing.", "Nope I don't agree with your dad. It's one thing to get mad in the parking lot but then to come up to you afterwards and physically hit things out of your hand is a different level. As many people have said play stupid games, win stupid prizes\n\nNTA", "Does he not understand that she assaulted you? I really loathe the excuse of \"a small mistake shouldn't ruin a person's life\" when it comes to crimes. Some extremely ugly things get swept under that rug. NTA", "> she can be kicked out of her program just because she made a small mistake \n\nYour dad should be blaming the program/school for being more strict than he thinks they should be.\n\nYou are not kicking anymore out of anything.", "In that case, easy NTA. Public spots are first come first serve and her reaction was totally unjustified. If she faces consequences from your report, it'll solely be due to her actions.", "Then you're absolutely NTA.", "That\u2019s how I feel! I\u2019m the type to always take a stand. I\u2019m a quiet person but for someone to act this outrageous, how many times did they get away with it or think it\u2019s okay? Like if I speech up it may prevent other things in the future. I was really nervous about my car getting keyed. I shouldn\u2019t have to go to college being worried someone may damage my property. \n\nI thought that too, actions have consequences. Even if it\u2019s small it\u2019s still an action a grown adult is capable of understanding you don\u2019t act that way. So I have to get punished and just take it?"]}
