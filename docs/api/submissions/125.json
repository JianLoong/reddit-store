All this would be a waste of time.\n\nAs for the rain, you mentioned this has happened more than once (but not to this extent).

But where do people get the gall to ask someone to buy them a big ticket item just because of a random unfortunate event? If you broke it I get it. But what if nobody was home and it got soaked?
