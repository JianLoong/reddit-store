But since it's a holiday, your holiday rates are $25 per hour - per kid.  Also tell them that it's an all or none situation with the kids and that you require a minimum of 5 hours and that the payment has to be made no later than the day before.  I am sure no one will want to take you up on it but if by some reason they do, then you are making at least $1,250 so that might make it worth it to you.

Make sure you tell them that. \n\nHonestly the level of entitlement to your time is actually ridiculous. \n\nNTA", "They're not asking you to babysit to get a day off, they're doing it to persuade you to have children.\n\nEveryone thinks that THEIR kid is a special darling angel who never misbehaves and is the perfect child to persuade someone CF to have children.  they think that getting you to look after their kids will show you how awesome and rewarding it is to be a parent and then you'll have babies too and stop having fun and making them jealous.", "NTA. OP, I would love it if you could start teaching workshops in which you teach others how to say no to entitled parents. I really loved your response.", "Uh, totally. If you want a break, hire a babysitter, don't ask the childfree by choice friend to babysit! OP is NTA.", "If she thinks that might happen she should have a deck of cards on her and teach them poker for sweeties, get them amped up on sugar and then hand them back to the parents....", "If the parents expected to have a sitter present and didn\u2019t find one ahead of time, instead assuming that the childless adults would be babysitters, I believe that would constitute poor planning on their part.", "It's because Thanksgiving prep often includes lots of boiling water frying oil, sharp knives, etc. to produce foods that are generally considered too much work to make the rest of the year.\n\nKeeping the kids occupied so their parents can safely cook is a normal thing when a family thanksgiving includes more than a couple dozen people.\n\nBUT in many households this means some combo of men and women work on food while the non-cooks entertain the kids with things like hikes, a game of football, watching the parade for younger kids, etc.\n\nThose who didn't help cook and didn't entertain the kids all morning usually get charged to help moderate kid conflicts at the children's table as their contribution to the meal.", "Haha yes! This is the way too. The only task I've ever purposely messed up in my entire working life was inventory. Simply so they would never ask me again. They never did", "Then who is giving you crap about it? And why isn\u2019t she defending you? Such a bizarre request in the first place. I mean I have seen and been in situations where a person shows up and then people start dumping kids on them, but which guest had the audacity to decide ahead of time that another guest should be given a babysitting job rather than getting to socialize?", "Okay and? It being friends or family doesn\u2019t really change anything for me. Is OP going to help with the cooking or cleaning or preparing? If not, j think it\u2019s 100% reasonable to expect OP to help with wrangling the kids. \n\nIt sounds like OP wants to just show up, do nothing, eat a meal she didn\u2019t help with and leave. That level of entitlement is mind blowing to me.", "I can see asking, but I can't see getting mad or telling the person they are an AH or figuring out a way to trick someone into watching my kid especially when I am still present. If i'm in the same place as my kid, I'm on duty even if my mom has fully taken over being with my kiddo, i will still keep and eye and ear on my kid to make sure they are ok. My kid my responsibility. \n\nOP you are  NTA, no one is ever the AH for refusing to watch someones elses kid unless it is an emergency situation but then it would still be a grey area. Wanting a break at Thanksgiving is the furthest thing from an emergency.", "Not just someone BUT A FEMALE. \n\nI don't recall signing any papers that state because I don't have kids that I'm required to give up all my holidays so parents can get a break. Whether that is work their shifts on holidays or babysit at events like this post - Hell no!", "I'm not supposed to give them Mountain Dew? For real? Or is this one of those made up rules like when my SIL claimed I shouldn't have taught a 12yr old to mix a Manhattan?", "Being around other people's kids makes you want kids even less", ">giving a 1yo a Mountain Dew\n\nNah, I think OP should definitely give Mountain Dew and sugar to any children left in their care. \n\nPixie stix, purely because those are the thing I think makes the most mess.", "I am quite sure they aren't saying that. \n\nI am quite sure the thought is that they are wiped out from having to be parent all the time and a childless person doesn't need a holiday break like they do.", "It's an old-fashioned way of doing things that the childless spinster women and elderly widows at parties would watch the children while the married women and women still of marriageable age would be out on the floor dancing.\n\nIt's an outdated concept that needs to go away and return to parents being responsible for their own children even on a holiday, or paying for someone to watch their children.", "When I need my kids occupied so I can cook I turn to Alexa and Disney+", "Actually the Thanksgiving doesn't start until almost dinner time.

This should make them realize how stupid they are to expect a person with no baby skills to take care of their children.", "More of a way of pointing out that me being left in charge of small children definitely have be given caffeine at some point and learn many many new exciting words that will cause daycares to call parents about the new word begin spread around by said child - it was more or less a last resort to get my friend to stop trying to make me like kids - yes we\u2019re are still good friends and yes I gave her son his first Mountain Dew at age 4 and taught him how to swear", "Yup absolutely agree with that", "Maybe this isn't the place for me then :(", " If you are someone who drinks, I would get drunk (or pretend to be drunk) make dirty jokes and swear around the children.

And he can still make a good Manhattan.", "Omfg \ud83d\ude02", ">Are you helping with the cooking or cleaning\n\nWanna bet there'll be a bunch of guys who are male guests sitting on the sofa watching TV and drinking beer? OP can go and sit with them.", "why ask OP at all? ask the other parents?", "Haha marked\\_soup reminded me of something, I think it was a coffee shop or something that had a sign \"unattended children will be given an espresso shot and a puppy\", just threaten them with showing their kids ALL of the available pooches in the pounds near them if they leave their kids with you after you said not to. \n\nAlso, they are shitty friends to invite you so you can watch their kids. I have a friend group and they all have kids, I've never been expected to watch them. Kids love me (not babies lol) so we usually play together but it's not expected and the parents actually make sure I actually want to play and don't feel obligated. When I'm done, I say so and it's respected. \n\nI still back the puppy tactic lol.", "Lol yes!"]}
