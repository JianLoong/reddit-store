But since it's a holiday, your holiday rates are $25 per hour - per kid.  Also tell them that it's an all or none situation with the kids and that you require a minimum of 5 hours and that the payment has to be made no later than the day before.  I am sure no one will want to take you up on it but if by some reason they do, then you are making at least $1,250 so that might make it worth it to you.

Like those without kids should consider babysitting to give those with kids a break just because they have kids and need a break?  That\u2019s entitled thinking.  The only possible way I can come up with it being ok for someone else to assume parents responsibility in the situation is say both mom and dad are in the kitchen making all the food, so it\u2019s a choice between them watching their own kids and they don\u2019t cook or someone else helping by watching and everyone gets to eat.", "This is a reality of life, people ask for stuff all the time that is unreasonable.
