I mean, it\u2019s extreme. We have three trees and our whole house is filled with Christmas stuff. She works in a very demanding industry (music) and December is the only time of the year that is really \u201cslow\u201d with her office being closed the last two weeks of the year, so she goes nuts baking and decorating and basically pretending to be a 50s housewife since it\u2019s the only time she really can. \r  \n\r  \nWe did have nice birthdays and when we got older she would take us to musical festivals, but they were always genres I really didn\u2019t like, but I guess it was fun going backstage.\r  \n\r  \nEvery year we also do a \u201cChristmas craft\u201d on Christmas Eve. We have done it since me and my brother (16M) were little. Things like doing gingerbread houses or making ornaments. \r  \n\r  \nThis year is my first year away at college. I still live in the same city as my parents, but I wanted some independence so I decided to live near campus. My parents supported this and do cover my tuition and rent. My friends were not going home for Christmas so they decided to throw a party on Christmas Eve. I told my mom I wanted to go to the party instead of coming over Christmas Eve. She sounded bummed, but I told her I was getting too old for her Christmas obsession anyway and wanted to do my own thing. I went to the party and had a ton of fun with my friends. \r  \n\r  \nI went to my parents house for Christmas day. I admit I was a bit later than I said I would be because I was hung over, but I still went. I asked my family what they ended up doing for the Christmas Eve craft and I found out they made wreaths out of a bunch of my mom\u2019s ornaments as well as vintage ones she went around to thrift shops to find. I was upset. My mom keeps the craft a surprise and if I had known it would be a special one I may have shown up! I asked my mom why she didn\u2019t tell me and she said \u201cYou know it's always a surprise.\u201d Since she had already bought the supplies for me to make one before I decided to go to the party, my mom ended up making two. I asked her if I could have one of the ones she made and I would keep it up in my apartment all year. She said no because she \u201clikes hers and wants to keep them.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI also noticed she didn\u2019t put up my Christmas stocking with everyone else's. I had the gifts I would normally get, but the stocking was put away. I asked why and she said \u201cI thought you were too old for my Christmas obsession.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nI got upset and told her all this Christmas shit annoys everyone and she is being petty. My brother and dad said not to speak for them because they like doing the Christmas craft every year with my mom and like all her decorations. I told my brother that maybe once he grew up some he would also want some independence and not want to waste his Christmas Eve gluing shit. \r  \n\r  \nChristmas was awkward of course, and I ended up leaving before NYE. My brother still says I\u2019m being an asshole, but I think he\u2019s just sucking up to mom, so AITA?\r", "created_utc": 1704213491, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wtmko/aita_for_not_doing_the_christmas_craft_with_my/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

YTA. Let me count the ways...\n\n1. Your post drips with contempt and condescension for your mom, who (news flash) exhausts herself during her only two quiet weeks from work making the holiday amazing and fun for your family. \n\n2. You are incredibly entitled and well-supported, to have your tuition AND RENT paid by loving parents despite there being a much less expensive option available. But, no sign of gratitude or recognition from you of that. LOL how is that 'independence' (on mom and dad's dime) working out for you?\n\n3. You rejected a family tradition. Regardless of what the craft was, you knew this was part of the family traditions. Not only did you sit it out, you managed to be insulting in the process. Why was that even necessary?\n\n4. You failed to show up on time for the actual day. A hangover is a super festive way to spend the holiday though, isn't it? Right in the spirit of things. \n\n5. You then thought, after being rude and negative at every beat, that you had any leg to stand on in ANGER against your mother for not, what convincing you to join the craft you'd already insulted after you rejected it? That's something you feel SHE owed YOU?\n\n6. Not having actually participated in any way, other than to tear her down, you felt you should be given the craft she made.\n\n7. You decided to speak for the group when very clearly, you only speak for yourself. \n\nYou owe your family an apology, and you owe yourself a new yours resolution to be less of a jerk.", "YTA. I know this isn't what you think you're saying, but this is what the rest of us are hearing.\n\nYour mum has a demanding work life but during Christmas she has more time and want to try to spend as much quality time with her family as she can. She's even come up with cute little family traditions to get her kids involved with the holiday spirit and make little crafty things. \n\nSide note - I'm sure you loved this when you were younger but as you're getting older it's not as exciting for you. But here's the kicker, for your mum it's not about the crafts, it's about spending time with her kids and the nostalgia and memories over having done this every year. And guess what? When you're older, you'll probably appreciate it for the exact same reasons.\n\nHer now 19yo daughter has moved away from home and she doesn't get to see her as much which makes Christmas time doubly special as it will finally feel like the whole family is together again.\n\nBut now her daughter is saying she doesn't want to come home to spend time with her family, she'd rather go to a party with her new friends instead. Not only that, she also slated the whole thing calling it an obsession.\n\nTo make matters worse, she then shows up late and hungover on Christmas day and has the audacity to get upset that she missed crafts time because actually it seemed kind of fun. Instead of being apologetic for ditching Christmas craft day she lashes out and makes matters worse by insulting her mum even further. All in all making Christmas day really awkward before she takes off again before new years.\n\nBottom line is, yes YTA. We all (including your mum) understand wanting to spend time with your new cool friends instead of sitting at home \"gluing shit\" with your parents. But the way you handled this situation was really poor and you owe your mum an apology.", "So basically you opted out spending time with your family because it wasn\u2019t worth it to you and have a terrible attitude in general but are pissed off you didn\u2019t get the benefits of having a family in spite of that? YTA and honestly? It\u2019s kind of pathetic how you went for begging for the craft to take with you to trying to act like it\u2019s stupid. You didn\u2019t fool anyone with that, your brother mom and dad all know you wanted that wreath.", "YTA you\u2019ve said you don\u2019t want to participate and find it boring yet expect to still receive the benefits of it? make it make sense. I\u2019d also like to add you seemed to be a little harsh on your mum. Treasure the time you have with your family especially if you\u2019re away at college and she\u2019s already doing so much for you. You should always treasure the time you have with your family life is too short to let that time disappear.", "Yta and you know Yta. You blew off a family tradition, got drunk and turned up late. Complained that you were left out and then belittled the one time of year when your mum gets to go all out. You behaved like a spoiled brat especially considering they pay for your rent and tuition. You should apologise and hope you get invited to join in next year.", "YTA Yes such independence they pay for everything, you don't get to call something stupid then be annoyed when people take you at your word you don't like it.", "YTA.\n\nYou want to do what you want but you also want your family to do what you want. You are acting like a spoiled brat.", "YTA, though being a teenage asshole is fairly normal behavior. I suppose you can hurt your mom as much as you want, and she\u2019ll always be there to spend time with you on your terms, small pettiness aside. Unless she isn\u2019t. My mom died before I got out of my teenage asshole phase, and I can\u2019t tell you how much I regret blowing her off for people who didn\u2019t even give me a phone call when she died. I hope you grow out of your bullshit quicker than I did.", "Yta.  You told your mom you didn't want to craft & that she's obsessed with Christmas.  Then you got upset when she didn't do Christmas stuff for you.   You can't have it both ways.  Welcome to adulting.", "YTA did you really think you weren't TA? You belittled your mom and showed up late on Christmas day. And you had a tantrum when you found out what the Christmas craft was because YOU chose not to go", "Yta because of how you told her you didn't want to participate. You were mean to her and she maybe reacted in a way you found pretty and then you blew up.  You are 19 and old enough to not turn into a child in conversations with parents who pay for your college and board.", "YTA. You didn't want to come do Christmas Eve crafts, which is fine, but the way you went about advising your mom of this was kinda AH territory (a 'I have other plans, sorry!' would have sufficed). Then complaining afterwards you didn't get to do the craft or take someone else's home with you after? That's childish. You made your bed, friend, and the grown-up thing to do is to lay in it.", "Lol this is fake right? Like nobody would be able to write this out and not realize that their own dialogue in the story is out of line and impolite, let alone publishing it for all to see.\n\nJust in case, YTA. I\u2019m not having kids primarily because I\u2019m afraid that once they\u2019re an adult, they\u2019ll be like you.", "YTA\n\nYou can't be upset about something being \"fun\" when you previously felt it beneath you to attend.\n\nI get that you want to enjoy being 19 and out of the house, but you doubled down and disrespected your mother's feelings and activities and made them seem unworthy of your time.\n\nThat does not mean your entire family has to stop doing traditions and what they like to do, nor can you be upset when you realize they moved on without you.\n\nThe ultimate in disrespect is showing up late on Christmas Day.  Hungover is NOT an excuse.  You just showed your family you did not care about their feelings.\n\nYou then have the audacity to be upset when you were cut out of some the traditions you bitched about.\n\nYou can't have it both ways.", "YTA - you can't have your cake and eat it. You made a decision to not spend Christmas Eve with your family, and they accepted it, carried on, and now you're feeling serious FOMO, because their lives didn't stop without you there. You have to accept that life carries on, with or without you.", "YTA. You could have gone to the party after or before or asked for a workaround instead of just shitting on your mom\u2019s joy. And then telling her you would have shown for the fancy craft is just shallow af", "YTA", "YTA, you can't have it both ways. You can't complain about chrismas obsession then complain about not having a christmas obsession. Get over yourself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're all over the map just trying to have your Xmas cookies and eat them too. Stop being an entitled brat- you can't do ONE evening with your family? It's really such a chore to spend Xmas Eve not partying? You're 19.
