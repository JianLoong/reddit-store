We have been married for 3 years, together for 3 years before that. He\u2019s a wonderful husband and father, provides everything we need, never tells me no, is involved with the kids, helps with household chores without being asked. I really couldn\u2019t ask for more and I am so happy with him. \n\nBefore we met, My ex fianc\u00e9 and I were together 6 years and he was my first love. We took a bit of a break when things got tough, we were young and didn\u2019t know how to navigate. I always thought we would get back together, work things out and be happily ever after, like the Notebook or something. However, while we were in the break, he died of diabetic ketone acidosis. He didn\u2019t take his insulin correctly, something I had always gotten onto him about and helped him manage. I was devastated, blamed myself for not being there, and it took me a few years to get over. I\u2019m still in touch with his family, and they treat me like the daughter in law they never got, so that made it all the harder. When they cremated him, they gave me some of his ashes. I have kept them, as well as his favorite shirt. I have them in a little box with some pictures of us in my cedar chest. \n\nMy husband found out, and he\u2019s uncomfortable with the fact I\u2019ve kept the ashes and the shirt. He thinks I should have moved on, that I\u2019m not some kind of widow, and that it\u2019s like he\u2019s second-choice. He doesn\u2019t see why I\u2019d keep the ashes and shirt if I wasn\u2019t unhappy with him and stuck on this guy. I don\u2019t see him as second-choice, I\u2019m very happy with him, I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s right to throw someone\u2019s remains away. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here for holding on to this \u201cstuff\u201d from my ex-fianc\u00e9?", "created_utc": 1695081377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mbkma/aita_for_keeping_my_first_fianc\u00e9s_ashes/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But 6 years was a long time to be in the relationship\n\nI mean, did you husband show compassion for such a huge loss? Or was he only jealous of a dead person?", "NTA\n\nEveryone grieves in their own way and if you need to keep the ashes and shirt of your first fianc\u00e9, keep them.\n\nYour husband should understand that your fianc\u00e9 was a very important part of your past, they're not in competition. He should respect your grief and it's pretty insensitive of him to imply that you should get rid of these things that help you grieve.", "Info:  How/why did you hide this from him for 6 years and after 3 children?", "NAH\n\nThere's a huge difference between keeping a momento from someone you cared about deeply VS like clinging to the past. It isn't like you have a shrine dedicated to them.\n\nI actually got in an argument with my Mother because she was demanding her current boyfriend get rid of the only photo he had of his wife on display, her reasoning was she's gone and part of the past.\n\nI think that's ridiculous. People touch us in our day to day lives, it's okay and healthy to still think about and love them. That doesn't make your love for living people any less. Love is infinite, there's always more to share.\n\nI will say this, it sounds like your current husband didn't know. From his perspective you were hiding it from him even if that wasn't your intent. I can understand why he's upset, you guys need to have an adult conversation about this.", "NTA for holding on to the stuff, but it probably wasn\u2019t great for your husband to find out now as opposed to much earlier in your relationship. He does need to understand that they are two different relationships.", "NTA. Your ex fiance is not competition for him. So he needs to be mature enough to accept that you had a life before him, that you will always feel some love for this man in the past and that you can keep his memory alive while being secure and happy in your present and future love for your husband and family.  This is kindness toward his family, as well. It's not as if you keep a shrine in your living room that all must acknowledge. You will never fully forget, but that he's your husband and the father of your children means that you have moved on while still acknowledging and valuing your past.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with how you feel about your husband and everything to do with honoring past memories. Even though you didn't get a chance to marry, there was still a strong connection that was worth honoring. It's not like you're keeping the items prominently displayed. Would he feel the same if it was a friend that you hadn't slept with?", "NTA \n\nAs someone who lost an ex-partner after we had already broken up, I\u2019m very glad I hung onto mementos from when we were together. Those things are important to you and no one should make you feel ashamed or like you need to discard them. \n\nAfter your spouse has had time to process a bit, try to explain to them that holding onto items of a friend who has passed doesn\u2019t mean that you would still be with them now even if they hadn\u2019t passed. Life is messy and complicated, and more importantly, you can\u2019t fight the past. You are the person today, the person your partner loves and who you have built a family with, because of those past relationships and life before. And that\u2019s ok and a good thing! Keeping items is a part of grief and the fact that your partner didn\u2019t know until now just means it\u2019s not something that is forefront in your mind.", "Nta", "I kept my ex\u2019s ashes even though we were broken up when he died. My husband thinks he\u2019s second choice. BECAUSE HE IS!!!! You broke up with the ex and held out that he was the one and would come back. He didn\u2019t. He died. You kinda sorta moved on but not really. However you met a nice guy and married him. You tell us how much you love the ex but never once did you say \u201cI love my husband. He\u2019s the love of my life.\u201d You don\u2019t say that bc the ex is the love of your life\u2026like in the notebook.", "NTA, why is ur husband jealous of a deceased person??", "NTA\u2014 It\u2019s so ungracious to be jealous of this poor dead guy. You\u2019re not sleeping with the shirt every night\u2014 he didn\u2019t even know about it! Why did you keep them? Because he was important to you and you shared a big part of your life with him! Your husband has you and your kids, why should he be jealous that this guy had your past? If this had only been a friend, a female best friend, you would have kept these things, too.", "YTA \n\nN T A for holding onto his stuff but you didn\u2019t help the situation by not being forthcoming to your husband.", "ESH \n\nYour husband for his lack of empathy - this i=was someone you were to marry.\nYou for never telling him and now you have this situation you are in.\n\nI would lose the shirt immediately and suggest you speak to your husband about your feelings.   First thing I would do would be apologize for not being open with him previously as well since you most certainly should have done that.", "Absolutely NTA! It's not your problem if your husband is upset about it, his emotions are his own problem. Maybe HE should work on his feelings and move on, not you, who clearly moved on since you got married and have children with him! Those memories are yours and very personal, you shouldn't cancel a part of your story just because someone else is upset about it.", "Moving on and completely forgetting or pretending he wasn't important are two very different thing.\n\nBut he isn't your \"ex.\" He is your former fiancee.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong. NTA.", "NTA.  Has he ever lost someone he loved? Particularly under tragic circumstances? I suspect not. Moving on does not mean forgetting about them or never again mourning their absence. It means you lead the best life you can, most likely in a way that is altered because of their life and their death. Would you be the same person if not for the experience with your ex fiance? Would you be the same person if he didn't die tragically? I think not. \n\nThose experiences--joys and fears and loss--were likely profound life shapers. And they, at least in part, led you to your relationship with your now husband. That is something you both should cherish and celebrate, not question. I think not only should your husband not be uncomfortable but want to learn everything he can about this person, and in the process learn so much more about you.", "NTA. My late fianc\u00e9 committed suicide 29 years ago and I found him. I have always been open with my husband about this and he has never had an issue with me remembering his birthday and the anniversary of his death. He doesn\u2019t ask me to get rid of his robe with his scent on it. I don\u2019t think he would even think to ask me to get rid of my keepsakes or to stop posting about him on important dates. Your husband needs to get over himself and realize that he can\u2019t just erase this from your life and it doesn\u2019t take anything away from him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn't sound like you bring him up often or display in a very noticeable place the momentous you have.  Your husband might be uncomfortable with the idea, but he needs to accept that you had a life before him. That doesn't mean you're not happy or in love with him and the life you share, it just means the road to him wasn't without some bends and curves.  Be reassuring, but this is something he needs to process and work through.", "My late husband passed away tragically due to an accidental fentanyl overdose in March 2021.  We had been together almost 9 years.  He was step-parent to my two oldest, and our son together was a month from turning 2.  He had battled addiction for years, and I honestly thought we had beaten it.  I was destroyed.  I truly felt that I would not survive it.\n\nFast forward to today, and I am married to a man that is truly my other half.  He is an amazing husband and father to my children and his own three.  He adores me, and has put pieces back together that he would never dream of breaking himself.\n\nThat being said, he is 100% comfortable with the fact that I have my late husband's ashes, as well as many things that belonged to him.  For me, it's still recent enough that I have moments out of nowhere, where I still breakdown at the memories.  He has never shown me anything but love and support during those times.  He encourages me to share memories and talk about my late husband, and we are able to connect because they also knew each other.  \n\nHowever, I also can see this from your husband's point of view.  My late husband had himself, lost a partner very suddenly prior to me, who he loved very much and planned to spend his life with.  In the early stages of my relationship, I felt almost insane for having feelings of jealousy when he talked about her.  She couldn't take him from me?  Of course he has memories!  I felt horrible with myself for those thoughts!\n\nI finally realized that it was my own insecurities.  My own feelings of being second best.  Because if she was alive, he and I probably wouldn't be together.  Just like if my late husband was still with us, I wouldn't be married to my own personal Prince Charming now.  The simple fact is that any one decision can change the course of all of our lives.  We can't live in \"what if's\".  You are married to and love your husband NOW.  Fate, destiny, or what have you happened and the universe brought you two together.  Things fall apart so something new can come together.  Hopefully with some reassurance your husband can come to understand that love can be different with different people, and that just because you still hold love and great memories in your heart for your late fiance, that you don't love him any less. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nOf all the weird shit to be jealous about, this might be the weirdest.", "NTA... I am wondering if it would be too much to ask his family to keep these belongings for you. Maybe they would respect your husbands feelings and be willing to be the keeper of these. If not, is there other ideas of compromise. \n\nHowever, I don't think I would ask this of my husband. I would only find it disturbing if it was on the mantle or his desk or part of his everyday life....", "Why, oh why do some people insist on telling someone who has lost a loved one how and how long they\u2019re supposed to grieve? NTA! You obviously had unresolved issues with your previous fianc\u00e9. That doesn\u2019t mean you stopped caring or loving him. It makes perfect sense to me that you held on to these things. I get that your husband might have been shocked to find this out, but he doesn\u2019t get to decide when you are ready to let go because he is uncomfortable. I truly hope you can get through to him.", "He knew about my past relationship from the start, he had sympathy, and I think now he was just shocked or taken aback at finding out I have these things still. I told him I threw everything else I had away in a fit of anger. Looking back, I think I was still grieving pretty hard and I regretted tossing the stuff almost immediately after doing it.", "Thats beautiful\n\nI also feel like with relationships, we put too much value on a person \"not having a past\" and that there cannot be any love left for those that have passed or even past partners (divorced, broken up)\n\nIts okay to have loved and lost and still feel care for a person. As long as you want to be with one person more than anyone else and are commited to them (no cheating), thats all that matters.", "My guess its because she never mentioned having the ashes or the t shirt in the 6 years they have been together.", "Fully disagree about the shirt. Just because you once loved a person who is now deceased doesn\u2019t mean that you would still be with them now if they weren\u2019t deceased. The items we have are all that\u2019s left of that person, that friend. OP should certainly have a conversation about their grief with their spouse if they\u2019re able. To me they weren\u2019t hiding it, it\u2019s just something that isn\u2019t on the forefront of their life anymore.", "Also NTA!", "Im really sorry for your loss\n\nI dont think your husband is a huge AH either, just like you said that he is shocked. But hopefully he can understand why you would want to keep them, especially because your ex-fiance's parents gave them to you. Maybe after the shock wears off, he will be more understanding\n\nIf you havent told him already, I would tell your husband you have never seen him as a second choice as he is saying this out of a place of insecurity. It is sad that he would be insecure about it but sometimes peoples' insecurities manifest in odd ways", "Ask him how long he\u2019s want you to keep *his* ashes if he passed away.", "Where you with your now husband when your first fianc\u00e9 was still alive?", "Precisely", "NTA\n\nAnyone who tells you that you can't keep ashes from someone you loved is automatically a giant red flagged A. Full Stop.", "NAH\n\nHonestly I think I\u2019d be devastated if I found out the same thing as your husband. My wife is the love of my life and if I ever found out I was her second choice, or, she was still imagining a life with another man, nothing would hurt me more.\n\nSo i think your husband is entitled to feel hurt and ask questions.\n\nEqually, your first fianc\u00e9 was clearly a huge part of your life and part of that love will always be with you, assuming you intended no harm in keeping it, then you aren\u2019t an A H either.\n\nI think the most harmful thing is that you didn\u2019t share this with your husband and kept it secret, I think that might make it hard for him to trust what you tell him but ultimately you both need to have a very open conversation about love and your relationship.", "Don\u2019t matter. This is the family that you have now.\nWould you be ok if he keeps a picture of his ex and him together and look at them every once in awhile?", "NAH, but you need to make your husband see that this wasn't an ex he WAS your fiance. Yes, if he didn't die you would not be with your husband but he did die, you did mourn and you did move on. But moving on doesn't mean you have to erase the past. Many people with dead partners choose one picture to keep on the wall even when they're happy with their new partner. Nothing wrong with this.\n\nHowever, you shouldn't have kept this from your husband. I'm thinking that's partly why he's upset. But talk to him again in a calm manner and focus on how your past has moulded you into the person you are today, the person that HE loves. It's just a memento box, nothing more.", "NTA. Why is your husband insecure about ashes? You\u2019re not going back to him.", "You're definitely NTA, and I don't think your husband is either... unless he doesn't come around. Having that intense reaction is one thing, but not seeing his opinion as unreasonable once he calms down is another.", "NTA! Your ex was a very important chapter in your life. You have every right to keep his ashes! It\u2019s not like you\u2019re dragging the box out reminiscing on what could have been. The only way you might be an AH is if you were intentionally hiding this from your husband instead of being honest from the start.", "I'd say NTA and if being honest? Neither is your husband. It's rough what happened to you, terrible and tragic. You have a piece of him to remember and thats what it is there for, it is a piece of him and a piece of your own heart that can never be taken/given to someone else.\n\nBut your husband is understandably worried, lest we forget, men are people too and have emotions, worries, fears. I would also be worried that I'm playing second fiddle to a memory.\n\nWhats important now is you get him to understand how important he and your family are to you. Your ex-fiance is gone and won't be coming back. But there will always be a part of him for you, and a part of you that will love him. Theres nothing wrong nor any shame in that. \n\nBut unless properly explained, people will always worry, as is part of our nature as people.", "My question is how long are you going to keep this stuff? Let\u2019s say your husband dies and then you die and you haven\u2019t thrown the stuff out. So your kids go through your stuff and find these pictures of this random man, ashes and shirt. What are they going to think? Imagine all the things that could go through their heads. My point is unless you are going to set your kids down some day and explain your reasons for keeping this stuff you need to get rid of it at some point.", "NTA, you were able to move on and sometimes having a few momentos and ashes can help us move on. Proof that, that person was real. Another way to look at it as well is, he wasn't just your fiance. You lost a friend, someone who was vital to your life for a good period of time.", "NTA\n\nOof hon my heart goes out to you.\n\nYou're valid for your feelings and I hope your husband can learn to be open to listening to them \ud83d\ude4f", "NTA. Tell him you did move on-you married him and started a family. These are memories. You're not sleeping in the shirt and wearing a vial of his ashes around your neck.", "NTA. If I were you, I'd move the ashes & whatnot to a location he can't access *immediately*.", "NTA. You\u2019re not comparing your fianc\u00e9 to your husband and you don\u2019t have a massive shrine that takes up a whole wall for him. You have a lovely small box to remember him by that is not an inconvenience to anyone. Your husband is in this competition all on his own. I can understand the initial shock of maybe not realizing you had the box. He\u2019s should have been understanding. He needs to work on his insecurities.", "NAH. I get why your husband might think a certain way and have uncomfortable feelings and I also get why you\u2019d keep the ashes\u2026.it\u2019s hard. Maybe therapy can help?", "My last bf died. I have a big bin filled with stuff of his and gifts from him etc. i post a pic of him every bday and the anniversary of his death. He died in 2018. And his parents showed up to my mothers wake this year. I\u2019m married and my husband is totally supportive. I mostly post pics for his parents happiness. And my hubby knows I love him him. This should be a non issue", "NTA \u2018he doesn\u2019t see why\u2019 . It is none if his fricken business. He is jealous if a dead guy.  My suggestion is to give the ashes to his family explaining that it has become a conflict in your new family.", "NTA. You basically are a widow. My partner was previously married and she passed away. She's on the mantle in our home.  I don't feel threatened by this, how could I? I'm the one that's still here. He feels threatened by a ghost and that's a him problem.", "NTA. \n\n  \nThis is part of your history, your husband should try to be more understanding.", "NTA. What is wrong with your husband? He is insecure over a dead man? He was a big part of your life. A secure man would have no issues with this. If you do decide to get rid of the ashes please do something meaningful with them or give them back to his family. Don\u2019t desecrate them by throwing them out.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being insecure and controlling.", "Nta and your husband sounds like he has some major insecurities. Its not a competition. The ex was an ex for a reason but it doesnt mean he is any less significant to your past, to who you are now. He is being absolutely silly but yet disturbingly disrespectful. Its vile. When my 1st love passed away, my husband made sure i went to pay my respects, for me, for my exs family. He didnt want me to have regrets or feeling like i couldn't grieve. I love my husband even more for that.  \n If you wear the shirt to sleep in most nights, maybe thats different but still odd. What if you make the ashes into jewelry? Would he feel better abt that or no? Your past is your past & rather the ashes are there or not, its still the same outcome, he is your husband. If my husband was this bothered, it would be an issue", "Definitely NTA. Everyone knows the first love is always special, and to know the only reason you two aren\u2019t together is because of a tragedy? Your husband is insecure, as you don\u2019t have a designated urn for him that\u2019s out for him to see. You have the ashes and shirt in a box. You still have him but the fact you don\u2019t have him out/not around you constantly shows how much you\u2019ve grown, and you being with your husband with you children shows that you HAVE moved on. You seem happy with your current life, and your husband should really take that into account.", "NTA. Your partner has zero empathy or understanding and needs to stop it right now.\n\nMy partner was jealous of my ex who passed until I set some pretty firm boundaries. I told him If you love me and want to be with me, you will give space for part of me to always love him, understand that our relationship helped shape who I am today, and, You don\u2019t get to be jealous of a dead guy.\n\nIf he has a problem with it, tell him to go to therapy.", "Info: what is your current feelings for your late fiancee? How often you check that shirt and what kind of feelings does that invoke?", "NTA. I still have my dads ashes because I don\u2019t know what to do about him.", "NTA but every day I get more and more convinced men can't feel the same emotions as women.  Maybe they're broken?", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nIf there's any category of people posting or posted about here that's not criminal but reliably lower than a mole belly, it's people who can't cope with their SO's grief for someone they loved who died. \"Get rid of your dead SO's things. Stop visiting your dead spouse's grave. I burned the last picture my SO had with them and their past partner who died, AITA? I don't think I am because their love for me should erase their whole life before me.\" FUCK those people.\n\nYou HAVE moved on. You're married to someone else, and if he truly loves you, he should not demand that you erase your whole past, especially the mementos of someone who was important to you but died.\n\nAlso: you are kind of a widow. You never got married, but you and him were close enough for long enough that it counts. Marriage is a legal contract and a religious ceremony if you're into that. Emotional widowhood exists even without that.", "NTA . YWBTA if you throw those ashes away (instead of saving them or giving them back to his family.) Maybe you can find a secret spot that he doesn't know about .", "NTA, but maybe consider spreading his ashes in a place that meant something to you in your own way.\n\nHusband is kinda jealous over nothing.", "It\u2019s rather telling that through your your story you tell us how much you loved your ex who passed but not once have you stated how much you love your current husband and in fact the only thing you do say good about him is the fact that he does a good job supporting you and your family.", "YTA \n\nI get what you mean. But I think you should be throwing those ashes into the sea or something now.", "NTA but it\u2019s hard for him as he feels like he is competing with a ghost. Could you compromise and bury the ashes in a family grave ? You could visit from time to time if you wanted and they would be out of the house . The t Shirt i think you should keep though . It\u2019s ok to have a memento of your ex . He meant a lot to you and  partly made you who you are today , the you that fell in love with your husband too.", "Info: where is your cedar chest located in your house?", "Scatter the ashes in a place special to you and your former fianc\u00e9e and give his shirt to a charity. Tell him you\u2019re happy now. That you have a wonderful husband and beautiful children. Then say goodbye.", "YTA.  You love your husband's resouces otherwise he is your second choice. Hopefully, he wises up.", "[removed]", "Honestly? Just bury the poor man. Keep the photos and the shirt if you must, but just let the man rest in peace in a proper cemetary.", "Perhaps try explaining to him that your ex fiance wasn\u2019t just a romantic partner, much in the same way that HE isn\u2019t either. Your husband and your ex fiance are two different people who fulfill very different roles in your life. Your ex was a dear companion who you loved as a romantic partner but also as a friend, who you lost and grieved deeply. \n\nWhat those ashes are to you now is less about mourning a romance and what could have been (what your husband is imagining im sure) and more about how there was a time he meant the world to you, how he was a man who lived and died and who was your friend. \n\nYou love your husband, and comparing the two is like apple and oranges. Same category, but theres no point comparing them.", "NTA, believe it or not. We all will fall in love many times over. You combine that with the situation at hand.\n\nYour husband is very jealous\u2026", "Yes.  Try to make the man that supports his family and done nothing wrong an AH.  She uses this man for resources and couldn't care less about him otherwise, yet he is supposedly the AH.  Right.", "It sounds like they were stored in a cedar chest. I can completely see him never realizing they were in there. If she is like me, she doesn\u2019t open her cedar chest often. \n\nMy cedar chest has been opened 4 times in the last 16 years. I opened it to put my children\u2019s baby blankets/coming home from the hospital outfits in it. I also opened it to put stuff in it after my daughter was stillborn. There are things in there that I know are there and I don\u2019t think about daily. It\u2019s just memories that I can share with my family later in my life. There\u2019s nothing hidden in it. I just don\u2019t have time to sit and go through it. I would lose an entire day sifting through the memories. Reminiscing over the good and hard memories. There are things in there from my now ex husband and I\u2019s wedding day. I\u2019m not getting rid of it. It\u2019s a part of my past, which has made me who I am today.", "That is my question.  Did you actively hide it?  Or was this something put away and basically forgotten.", "This, and I don't even understand how it's controversial, it's obvious as hell to me.", "If you're competing with a ghost and LOSING, than you deserve to lose. Sorry. This is true regardless of gender - there have been plenty of women on this sub being absolute gaping assholes about their male partner's grief for a past female partner who died.\n\nI hate how weird people here are about grief when it comes to a dead SO specifically. Does a present dog insist you take down photos of past dogs who died? No. Do present children insist you hide all memory of past children who died? No. Parents, grandparents, siblings, friends? No, usually it's understood you want to keep something of people you loved around.\n\nIt's only when it's a romantic partner that people feel like it's OK to demand that the memory be erased and the mementos gone, and that is just insane to me. Does the husband think she's somehow fucking the ashes or whatever? I don't understand what the problem is. She's obviously not cheating, dude is DEAD, and she's with current partner 100%. But she loved him and that's OK.", "I don't think that the 'first love, who passed away' is a hard concept to grasp. And also, i don't think its realistic at all, that they wouldn't have conversations with their kids about stuff like this, until they pass.", "I think it's perfectly reasonable to explain to the kids what this stuff is and why it's important when they're old enough.\n\n\"Get rid of\" ashes and photos? Why is that necessary? These are harmless but important items! TELL the kids what they are. I bet the kids will understand and respect them if you do it right.", "Your husband is a good egg. That's how it should be.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

This is not the same as a normal breakup. You don't \"move on\" when someone dies, you change and become different. What you have is all that's left. This is not the time and place for jealousy.NTA", "Definitely NTA. Why does he feel so threatened by you having the ashes of someone you loved?", "Excuse me?", "Why would she? Isn\u2019t she allowed to have her own possessions? Does she know every thing he owns? Don\u2019t most people have some mementoes from a previous relationship?", "Really she just forgot to mention hey I have my ex husbands ashes and  shirt in our house. You are actually trying to say she did not remember for 6 years to tell him? I find that very hard to believe.", ">I told him I threw everything else I had away in a fit of anger.\n\nShe lied and his 'second choice' does not come from his insecurity, OP literally says it in the post.\n\n''I always thought we would get back together, work things out and be happily ever after''\n\nNothing wrong with that but I'd suggest at this point it might be time to start being honest OP. He is the second choice, it is what it is, stop denying it and def don't try to twist it and attack him.", "He'll think that's different somehow.", "Well if he was a good partner probably would want her to spread them and move on with her life to something better.", "OP very clearly answers this in the original post. Just read it dude", "Way to tell us you have never been in a healthy relationship without telling us directly. You see in a healthy relationship you would talk about personal things with your significant other. Especially something so important. I can\u2019t believe I had to type that out. Oh wait it\u2019s Reddit.", "She threw everything \u201celse\u201d away, ie everything except for the ashes and T-shirt. She didn\u2019t lie, this is what she said to her husband after he discovered she kept the ashes and T-shirt. \n\nShe met her husband after her first fianc\u00e9 died. What about that makes him the second choice? Do you think everyone who remarries after their spouse or partner dies is with their second choice?", "\u201cSomehow\u201d\u2026she was never even married to her 1st boyfriend, and they weren\u2019t even dating when he died.  Yes, SOMEHOW I think her husband and father of her three children will think it\u2019s a little different.", "There are no rules in grief."]}
