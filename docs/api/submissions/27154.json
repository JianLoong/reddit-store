We have been married for 3 years, together for 3 years before that. He\u2019s a wonderful husband and father, provides everything we need, never tells me no, is involved with the kids, helps with household chores without being asked. I really couldn\u2019t ask for more and I am so happy with him. \n\nBefore we met, My ex fianc\u00e9 and I were together 6 years and he was my first love. We took a bit of a break when things got tough, we were young and didn\u2019t know how to navigate. I always thought we would get back together, work things out and be happily ever after, like the Notebook or something. However, while we were in the break, he died of diabetic ketone acidosis. He didn\u2019t take his insulin correctly, something I had always gotten onto him about and helped him manage. I was devastated, blamed myself for not being there, and it took me a few years to get over. I\u2019m still in touch with his family, and they treat me like the daughter in law they never got, so that made it all the harder. When they cremated him, they gave me some of his ashes. I have kept them, as well as his favorite shirt. I have them in a little box with some pictures of us in my cedar chest. \n\nMy husband found out, and he\u2019s uncomfortable with the fact I\u2019ve kept the ashes and the shirt. He thinks I should have moved on, that I\u2019m not some kind of widow, and that it\u2019s like he\u2019s second-choice. He doesn\u2019t see why I\u2019d keep the ashes and shirt if I wasn\u2019t unhappy with him and stuck on this guy. I don\u2019t see him as second-choice, I\u2019m very happy with him, I just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s right to throw someone\u2019s remains away. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here for holding on to this \u201cstuff\u201d from my ex-fianc\u00e9?", "created_utc": 1695081377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mbkma/aita_for_keeping_my_first_fianc\u00e9s_ashes/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But 6 years was a long time to be in the relationship\n\nI mean, did you husband show compassion for such a huge loss? Or was he only jealous of a dead person?", "NTA\n\nEveryone grieves in their own way and if you need to keep the ashes and shirt of your first fianc\u00e9, keep them.\n\nYour husband should understand that your fianc\u00e9 was a very important part of your past, they're not in competition. He should respect your grief and it's pretty insensitive of him to imply that you should get rid of these things that help you grieve.", "Info:  How/why did you hide this from him for 6 years and after 3 children?", "NAH\n\nThere's a huge difference between keeping a momento from someone you cared about deeply VS like clinging to the past. It isn't like you have a shrine dedicated to them.\n\nI actually got in an argument with my Mother because she was demanding her current boyfriend get rid of the only photo he had of his wife on display, her reasoning was she's gone and part of the past.\n\nI think that's ridiculous. People touch us in our day to day lives, it's okay and healthy to still think about and love them. That doesn't make your love for living people any less. Love is infinite, there's always more to share.\n\nI will say this, it sounds like your current husband didn't know. From his perspective you were hiding it from him even if that wasn't your intent. I can understand why he's upset, you guys need to have an adult conversation about this.", "NTA for holding on to the stuff, but it probably wasn\u2019t great for your husband to find out now as opposed to much earlier in your relationship. He does need to understand that they are two different relationships.", "NTA. Your ex fiance is not competition for him. So he needs to be mature enough to accept that you had a life before him, that you will always feel some love for this man in the past and that you can keep his memory alive while being secure and happy in your present and future love for your husband and family.  This is kindness toward his family, as well. It's not as if you keep a shrine in your living room that all must acknowledge. You will never fully forget, but that he's your husband and the father of your children means that you have moved on while still acknowledging and valuing your past.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with how you feel about your husband and everything to do with honoring past memories. Even though you didn't get a chance to marry, there was still a strong connection that was worth honoring. It's not like you're keeping the items prominently displayed. Would he feel the same if it was a friend that you hadn't slept with?", "NTA \n\nAs someone who lost an ex-partner after we had already broken up, I\u2019m very glad I hung onto mementos from when we were together. Those things are important to you and no one should make you feel ashamed or like you need to discard them. \n\nAfter your spouse has had time to process a bit, try to explain to them that holding onto items of a friend who has passed doesn\u2019t mean that you would still be with them now even if they hadn\u2019t passed. Life is messy and complicated, and more importantly, you can\u2019t fight the past. You are the person today, the person your partner loves and who you have built a family with, because of those past relationships and life before. And that\u2019s ok and a good thing! Keeping items is a part of grief and the fact that your partner didn\u2019t know until now just means it\u2019s not something that is forefront in your mind.", "Nta", "I kept my ex\u2019s ashes even though we were broken up when he died. My husband thinks he\u2019s second choice. BECAUSE HE IS!!!! You broke up with the ex and held out that he was the one and would come back. He didn\u2019t. He died. You kinda sorta moved on but not really. However you met a nice guy and married him. You tell us how much you love the ex but never once did you say \u201cI love my husband. He\u2019s the love of my life.\u201d You don\u2019t say that bc the ex is the love of your life\u2026like in the notebook.", "NTA, why is ur husband jealous of a deceased person??", "NTA\u2014 It\u2019s so ungracious to be jealous of this poor dead guy. You\u2019re not sleeping with the shirt every night\u2014 he didn\u2019t even know about it! Why did you keep them? Because he was important to you and you shared a big part of your life with him! Your husband has you and your kids, why should he be jealous that this guy had your past? If this had only been a friend, a female best friend, you would have kept these things, too.", "YTA \n\nN T A for holding onto his stuff but you didn\u2019t help the situation by not being forthcoming to your husband.", "ESH \n\nYour husband for his lack of empathy - this i=was someone you were to marry.\nYou for never telling him and now you have this situation you are in.\n\nI would lose the shirt immediately and suggest you speak to your husband about your feelings.   First thing I would do would be apologize for not being open with him previously as well since you most certainly should have done that.", "Absolutely NTA! It's not your problem if your husband is upset about it, his emotions are his own problem. Maybe HE should work on his feelings and move on, not you, who clearly moved on since you got married and have children with him! Those memories are yours and very personal, you shouldn't cancel a part of your story just because someone else is upset about it.", "Moving on and completely forgetting or pretending he wasn't important are two very different thing.\n\nBut he isn't your \"ex.\" He is your former fiancee.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong. NTA.", "NTA.  Has he ever lost someone he loved? Particularly under tragic circumstances? I suspect not. Moving on does not mean forgetting about them or never again mourning their absence. It means you lead the best life you can, most likely in a way that is altered because of their life and their death. Would you be the same person if not for the experience with your ex fiance? Would you be the same person if he didn't die tragically? I think not. \n\nThose experiences--joys and fears and loss--were likely profound life shapers. And they, at least in part, led you to your relationship with your now husband. That is something you both should cherish and celebrate, not question. I think not only should your husband not be uncomfortable but want to learn everything he can about this person, and in the process learn so much more about you.", "NTA. My late fianc\u00e9 committed suicide 29 years ago and I found him. I have always been open with my husband about this and he has never had an issue with me remembering his birthday and the anniversary of his death. He doesn\u2019t ask me to get rid of his robe with his scent on it. I don\u2019t think he would even think to ask me to get rid of my keepsakes or to stop posting about him on important dates. Your husband needs to get over himself and realize that he can\u2019t just erase this from your life and it doesn\u2019t take anything away from him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn't sound like you bring him up often or display in a very noticeable place the momentous you have.  Your husband might be uncomfortable with the idea, but he needs to accept that you had a life before him. That doesn't mean you're not happy or in love with him and the life you share, it just means the road to him wasn't without some bends and curves.  Be reassuring, but this is something he needs to process and work through.", "My late husband passed away tragically due to an accidental fentanyl overdose in March 2021.  We had been together almost 9 years.  He was step-parent to my two oldest, and our son together was a month from turning 2.  He had battled addiction for years, and I honestly thought we had beaten it.  I was destroyed.  I truly felt that I would not survive it.\n\nFast forward to today, and I am married to a man that is truly my other half.  He is an amazing husband and father to my children and his own three.  He adores me, and has put pieces back together that he would never dream of breaking himself.\n\nThat being said, he is 100% comfortable with the fact that I have my late husband's ashes, as well as many things that belonged to him.  For me, it's still recent enough that I have moments out of nowhere, where I still breakdown at the memories.  He has never shown me anything but love and support during those times.  He encourages me to share memories and talk about my late husband, and we are able to connect because they also knew each other.  \n\nHowever, I also can see this from your husband's point of view.  My late husband had himself, lost a partner very suddenly prior to me, who he loved very much and planned to spend his life with.  In the early stages of my relationship, I felt almost insane for having feelings of jealousy when he talked about her.  She couldn't take him from me?  Of course he has memories!  I felt horrible with myself for those thoughts!\n\nI finally realized that it was my own insecurities.  My own feelings of being second best.  Because if she was alive, he and I probably wouldn't be together.  Just like if my late husband was still with us, I wouldn't be married to my own personal Prince Charming now.  The simple fact is that any one decision can change the course of all of our lives.  We can't live in \"what if's\".  You are married to and love your husband NOW.  Fate, destiny, or what have you happened and the universe brought you two together.  Things fall apart so something new can come together.  Hopefully with some reassurance your husband can come to understand that love can be different with different people, and that just because you still hold love and great memories in your heart for your late fiance, that you don't love him any less. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nOf all the weird shit to be jealous about, this might be the weirdest.", "NTA... I am wondering if it would be too much to ask his family to keep these belongings for you. Maybe they would respect your husbands feelings and be willing to be the keeper of these. If not, is there other ideas of compromise. \n\nHowever, I don't think I would ask this of my husband. I would only find it disturbing if it was on the mantle or his desk or part of his everyday life....", "Why, oh why do some people insist on telling someone who has lost a loved one how and how long they\u2019re supposed to grieve? NTA! You obviously had unresolved issues with your previous fianc\u00e9. That doesn\u2019t mean you stopped caring or loving him. It makes perfect sense to me that you held on to these things. I get that your husband might have been shocked to find this out, but he doesn\u2019t get to decide when you are ready to let go because he is uncomfortable. I truly hope you can get through to him.", "He knew about my past relationship from the start, he had sympathy, and I think now he was just shocked or taken aback at finding out I have these things still. I told him I threw everything else I had away in a fit of anger. Looking back, I think I was still grieving pretty hard and I regretted tossing the stuff almost immediately after doing it.", "Thats beautiful\n\nI also feel like with relationships, we put too much value on a person \"not having a past\" and that there cannot be any love left for those that have passed or even past partners (divorced, broken up)\n\nIts okay to have loved and lost and still feel care for a person. As long as you want to be with one person more than anyone else and are commited to them (no cheating), thats all that matters.", "My guess its because she never mentioned having the ashes or the t shirt in the 6 years they have been together.", "Fully disagree about the shirt. Just because you once loved a person who is now deceased doesn\u2019t mean that you would still be with them now if they weren\u2019t deceased. The items we have are all that\u2019s left of that person, that friend. OP should certainly have a conversation about their grief with their spouse if they\u2019re able. To me they weren\u2019t hiding it, it\u2019s just something that isn\u2019t on the forefront of their life anymore.", "Also NTA!", "Im really sorry for your loss\n\nI dont think your husband is a huge AH either, just like you said that he is shocked. But hopefully he can understand why you would want to keep them, especially because your ex-fiance's parents gave them to you. Maybe after the shock wears off, he will be more understanding\n\nIf you havent told him already, I would tell your husband you have never seen him as a second choice as he is saying this out of a place of insecurity. It is sad that he would be insecure about it but sometimes peoples' insecurities manifest in odd ways", "Ask him how long he\u2019s want you to keep *his* ashes if he passed away.", "Where you with your now husband when your first fianc\u00e9 was still alive?", "Precisely"]}
