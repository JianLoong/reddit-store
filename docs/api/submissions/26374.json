However, given OP\u2019s description of the father being an outward homophobe this doesn\u2019t seem to be the case and seems to be a secret thing. Plus, if the mom is in on it why would it matter if op brought to her what they saw? Mom would already know and would probably laugh it off so no harm done. But otherwise, wouldn\u2019t anyone want to protect their mom against something like this? How would the dad even react?", "If they're swingers then nothing bad happens. If they're not swingers (which, let's be real, OPs parents aren't swingers loool), then it's just being tacit in his cheating, and lying.", "Maintaining an emotional or sexual relationship outside your marriage is the basic definition for cheating. This situation certainly seems to qualify. Speaking to the one who has a homosexual hook up app on their phone for clarity is complete reasonable.", "I would consider the person I\u2019m married to having any type of dating app on their phone to be cheating.", "[deleted]", "I understand wanting to protect your mom but this is still an adult relationship that in the end is not your business. If you want to protect your mom you can at least go to her with something more concrete then \"I saw an app\". He'll do more harm than good to his mom if he just goes on with unfounded accusations.", "I mean given the information presented it's pretty fucking obvious that it's more than just having the app. I think we just seriously have a case of this person doesn't care about the cheating because they are simply a bad person.", "Shown your true colours there. I\u2019ve added 2 words for clarity, racist.", "It\u2019s absolutely more concrete than that it\u2019s \u201cI saw Grindr (aka the hookup app for gay men) on dads phone and he had a full on profile stating he was \u2018looking\u2019 did you know about this?\u201d \n\nWhat OTHER possible explanations could there be for having that on one\u2019s phone? And just because it\u2019s an \u201cadult\u201d relationship doesn\u2019t mean people close to the couple can\u2019t bring up red flags? Especially when those raising said flags were actually created by the couple? Give me a break"]}
