Buying the truck might be a bad move, but buying a house with a GF of 7 months would be a massively stupid move.  Why on earth would you do that, as opposed to one of you just moving in to the other's rental?", "Any 26 year old who can save $123,000 has the right to buy whatever they want.  You still have a hefty downpayment (depending on where you live) for a house. She makes more than you and what does she have in savings? \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "I kind of get a feeling like she figured YOU would pay for the house, and she could just live there if you say she has nothing to show for it.  \n\n\nSure, a 60K vehicle is way too much to spend, but at the same time, that's kind of what vehicles are going for now. You might have a work truck but as an HVAC person, you're probably kind of handy and it's nice to be able to pick up a load of lumber for a deck without having to rent a vehicle.  It's the world we live in now.  \n\n\nWhen my husband and I got married, I was the one who owned a house, and he was living at home, helping his widowed mom run her farm.  He also worked off the farm.  He owned land that we built a house on, and when I sold my home, most of the money went to pay down the mortgage, the rest to savings. So, BOTH of us were responsible with money.  Your girlfriend you say makes more money than you, so where is HER money - bigger rent payments only make up so much of her expenses.", "I don\u2019t think a big truck for an HVAC worker and probable future homeowner is irresponsible at all, I agree with others that it sounded like she wanted you to buy her a home to live in..not a together thing.. NTA", "NTA, and you should be careful before progressing in this relationship.\n\nA new truck isn\u2019t the best use of money, but you splurging on that for yourself is more than outweighed by the fact that you have overall lived a frugal lifestyle and did a great job of accumulating savings.\n\nShe, on the other hand, has no trouble criticizing your purchase even though she has been horrible with her money (comparatively) if she makes more than you and has no savings. \n\nI expect she was already counting on your savings as yours and hers, so that your sacrificing to accumulate savings was going to be l her way to erase her history of pissing away all of her money with no one questioning her spending.", "NTA. It\u2019s only 7 months in and she\u2019s expecting you to buy her a house\u2014and that\u2019s what it is, it\u2019s not that you were financially irresponsible, it\u2019s that you spent money on something she can\u2019t benefit from. I would think with your line of work a truck might actually come in handy.", "NTA. A love interest of 7 months does not get a say in your financials. She wants you to put up the money for a house she'll enjoy.... where's her money? Keep money and living situations separate for now.", "7 months dude. She's wanting a free ride. NTA.", "I do think she has a general point about that truck being a questionable financial decision [ETA: I say this because I think it's not a smart to spend 48% of your savings on a vehicle], however you're right about the hypocrisy of you having a huge chunk saved up and her having none. If I had that much of a downpayment, I would not buy a house with anyone who couldn't match it. Now that would be a stupid financial decision. \n\nPlus, you've only been dating 7 months and don't live together. Your finances are none of her business at this point. At the very least, I would not move in with her until you both can get on the same page money-wise. NTA", "NTA.  A 60k down payment is enough to qualify for a 300k home mortgage.  Enjoy your truck.  You earned it.", "YTA to yourself for dating somebody who is trying to tell you how you should spend your money after only being together for seven months. It's way too early to even consider living together.", "NTA. This makes me laugh too and I had so much to say about it but deleted everything. The irony of someone without a lot of savings accusing someone with a lot of being irresponsible is hilarious to me.\n\nAt the end of the day it\u2019s your money and not hers. Your Pontiac is at least 15 years old and buying a house at 26 isn\u2019t the biggest priority especially with the market like it is. \n\nPersonally, I think it shows more discipline to save $123k than it does recklessness to pay in cash for a truck.", "If there is ever a time to buy a massively expensive truck it's when you are young and can pay it off outright.\n\nAsk you gf how much down payment she has to contribute.", "NTA - You're amazing, having saved up that much. She can go pound sand. Your money, your choice. Enjoy that truck. :)", "NTA - I dont even think it was a stupid move as others have posted. If your bills are paid and you can afford it then go for it. It doesn't really matter the cost it was something you really wanted. iit's not like you chose the truck over food and housing. Tell her that if/when she wants to move in together to give you an amount she can put down and you will match that. No more no less. \n\nDId you ask to explain herself with your point of she makes more than you and has no savings? What exactly were her expectations - for you to foot the whole bill and her to carry on spending her money on things she whatever she wants?

It\u2019s way too soon to be divulging savings and thinking about buying a house. She thinks you\u2019re financially irresponsible and you think she is clearly your financial mindsets do not align. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  The red flag was there when you said she earned more but had little saved.  She was expecting you to fully deposit on a house.  Enjoy your truck and reconsider if long term this us the best relationship for you.", "NTA, she can save and buy a house with her money", "NTA - seven months of dating, don't live together, have separate finances - why is she weighing in on how you spend your money?  Especially when she doesn't have the savings you do.\n\nIs buying a $60k truck a smart investment....probably not, but it's your money.", "It\u2019s your money bro, buy the truck if you want to. That\u2019s an expensive car but not crazy unreasonable. You\u2019ve been together 7 months, you have no business buying a home together anyways. NTA", "You didn't have to blow 60k if you didn't want to move in with her.", "NTA. It's your money and you worked hard for it. You deserve to treat yourself to something you've been wanting for a while. Plus, you mentioned that you saved up and got a huge pay rise, so it's not like you're being financially irresponsible. Your girlfriend should understand and support your decisions.", "Look the truck isn\u2019t gonna give you attitude, if you\u2019re credit is correct you still have a manageable down payment. And if it\u2019s your first home you can do an fha and put 3.5% down.", "NTA, you have saved your money, you needed a new vehicle, vehicles are expensive and taking out a loan makes it more so. You used some savings, but you have shown that you know how to save. as soon as she starts saving as much as you do she might have a point, right now... She wants your money.", "Major red flags. She\u2019s using you. She wants you to buy a house for the two of you while she contributes nothing.\n\nTell her you\u2019re open to looking at moving in together if you both contribute 50% each to a down payment, let\u2019s say 75k. I mean, she makes more than you but you\u2019re the one who has 123k saved up while she has NOTHING WHATSOEVER SAVED UP? \n\nIf you buy a house, don\u2019t put her on the deed.", "Info: why does she have nothing to show? Because a nurse making more than $55 an hour sounds like a masters or higher education.", "Nta, but why waste time with her?  You guys should look for people who are more similar to ya", "NTA. If she views you as irresponsible, what is she?  I'd tread very carefully before moving in together OR combing finances. Good luck OP, & enjoy your new truck!!", "NTA\nYou saved six figures. That's awesome. It's your money and you guys aren't married so do whatever you want. Sounds like you guys might not be financially on the same page. If she's been work long time and hasn't been saving that's a red flag.", "You're clearly better with your money. And she can't choose what you do with your money.\nNTA.", "Congrats on the new truck !", "NTA. You work hard and you can use your money at your discretion. You have earned it and it\u2019s honestly a reasonable purchase giving your career and income. She\u2019s kind of counting her eggs before they hatch considering y\u2019all haven\u2019t been dating that long in the grand scheme of things. So it sounds like she\u2019s more upset that your hard earned money isn\u2019t  benefitting her than the fact you made a poor purchase (which you didn\u2019t).", "You're not the irresponsible one, If she's getting a higher salary yet you're the one who saved 123k and she saved zero.\n\nNTA dude and find yourself a girl who knows her checks and balances like yourself.", "123k minus 60k is 63k. Ask her where her 63k is to contribute for a down payment", "NTA and the (mostly female) commenters don't get it. You lived well within your means and saved up money to buy a luxury item that you will enjoy. Who cares if it's not a \"smart financial decision\" most people don't make smart financial decisions all the time. They order out, buy Starbucks, get new phones and all those things add up but are invisible. No one questions those because they are small and spread out but you avoided those for years in order to make one large luxury purchase. People see the price and get sticker shock because it's not disguised as hundreds of smaller purchases.\n\nAs someone who also recently purchased a new truck with a large down payment and very low interest rate I salute you. But seeing as a bought a silverado I must say screw you and I hope you enjoy your Fix Or Repair Daily.", "If this were a marriage and the two of you had joint money and a decision to save for a house, the unilateral decision to buy the expensive truck instead would have been irresponsible.  \n\nBut this is a woman you've dated for 7 months.  You're very financially responsible and get to spend the money you save as you like, without regard to her priorities. This includes buying a truck or indulging a lifelong dream to visit the South Pole.  It's not her choice.\n\nYou earn great money; you must be very highly skilled and valued by your company.  You've saved before and you can save again.  Obviously getting the house right away (with interest rates through the roof) was not your priority.\n\nYou might love each other, but your GF has no right to try to control your financial decisions.  Besides, it's not as if you're spending your money on gambling and recreational drugs!  She sounds a tad controlling and judgmental.  Look for this in other aspects of your relationship and think about what this would mean for you longterm.\n\nNTA", "Good for you. Your savings spoil yourself. Enjoy the Truck. When she can prove that she doesn\u2019t live hand to mouth she has a right to comment. Until then drive like you stole it!!!", "Nta.  That truck is at least partly an investment.  Bad transportation for skilled craftsmen weakens their earning power by reducing the radius of jobs they can take.\n\nI would respond to your girlfriend by taking note how eagerly she spends your money for you.  That and her manipulative response when you don't fawn over her every word \n\nNot a deal breaker but call it a yellow flag for potential entitlement", "Nta, you have no obligation to her with what sounds like the stage of your life financially. It may be a good time for a long term plan conversation with her to see if you two have similar financial goals that are specifically NOT dependent on each other. She may be relying on your home ownership without any effort from her, which is not cool.", "Oh she fully expected you to buy her a house lmfao. NTA", "NTA. You've only been dating 8 months. How much has she saved for the down payment.  I see red flags.", "Red flag if she makes more than you and hasn't saved anything", "Before moving to the next stage you will\nNeed to be in the same page financially. Good for you to save and buy what you want. \n\nAs you said she makes more but has less. If you ever want to move then you both go over the budget and lay out what you spend each month. This will give you a clear picture so you can make a informed decision. Bad spending habits can break a good relationship", "Financially irresponsible?! When you have enough saved for a new truck and a down payment for a house?\n\nI know reddit always jumps straight to red flag and dump them. I don't want to get in your head, but her reaction really should make you pause and reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with upgrading things for yourself when it is within your means. You've been driving a beater. A new truck will be safer, lower maintenance costs, no looming threat of breakdowns, and better gas mileage (depending on the engine, my hybrid F150 gets stupid awesome mileage).\n\nPlus you still have plenty for a down payment. Hell, you could likely qualify to buy something completely on your own with that. I can't help but feel like she was banking on that and probably wanted something that would push just beyond what was affordable.\n\nRight now is an awful time to buy anyway. For the same reason we're waiting to sell until March.\n\nNTA", "NAH. Sounds like you two are financially incompatible.", "I agree with your girlfriend that the truck was a questionable decision, you could've gotten pretty much whatever you wanted for less than that AND you could have financed it and left the large majority of your savings in an interest bearing account since your plan is to buy a home.\n\nBut I also have to say NTA because you're not married and it's your money to do whatever you want with, you saved it, you have no obligation to buy a house for her to live in. Also, a bit weird that you feel the only option to move in together is to buy a house. Why can't one of you move in with the other in your current living situations? Or rent a new place together? You have 60k cash on hand and make 110k/yr, how can you not get a rental or buy a reasonable house with that? Do you live in NYC or something?", "NTA \nShe has nothing to contribute to a down payment but wants you to keep all yours for one? You still have quite the savings and no truck payment.", "NTA for the reasons you\u2019re claiming, but what she\u2019s saying isn\u2019t what she\u2019s thinking. You\u2019re buying a truck instead of a ring. For her, it\u2019s time to move on.", "I'm going NAH. It's your money, and you can do whatever you want to with it, but your girlfriend is also right that people in committed relationships need to be able to talk to each other about money and make decisions together. Is a 7-month relationship at that level? Only you two can decide. It's not like you went into debt, though, and you're clearly financially responsible. You better take care of that truck, though.", "I would say NTA, but spending $60k on a truck is irresponsible, to me. I personally wouldn't spend that much on a 1/2 ton truck. Truck are way overpriced and are a big depreciating asset right about now. I would have looked for a used certified truck and saved a big chunk of money. And I get it, lots of people would like to drive a brand new vehicle, but the smart move in today's market is to wait. Just like it's not a smart move to buy a house now either.", "Sort of, because you probably didn\u2019t need a toy that expensive unless you\u2019re actually using it as intended. That is a pretty big chunk of change to drop. \n\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to justify it to her if it you have 120k in the bank.", "I have to agree with her, that does seem an odd use of the money that you worked and saved so hard for.  But you do you.\n\nSo no,  NAH, just two people with different opinions and values and plans. But  I think you just torpedoed the chances of you two living together.", "What is thing with American men and giant stupid trucks?", "I think you are your GF are not compatible in the long run.\n\nYou admit your GF was right, that you did't need a truck, and purchasing a home was a wiser decision.  But you still went your short term desire of a truck.\n\nShe sees that as you not being able to delay your gratification , and giving into impulsive behavior (MY WORDS, not hers).\n\nYou say she can not save and you can there for you can be  be less financially responsible as you do have a  large amount of savings.  But does she have other debt such as student loans, or health care debt that she is paying off?\n\nWe don't know enough about the GF's situation.\n\nBut if you have money for that large a down payment for a house,  I would consider that the wiser investment, depending on where you live.

The truck lost 20% of its value when you turned on the ignition and drove it off the lot, now it is worth $48K.  And you didn't talk it over with her first.
