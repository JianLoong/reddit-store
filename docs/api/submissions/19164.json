I sent him mine and just assumed he needed them for filing reasons. \n\nThe other day, I received an email without context from who I had to assume was my dad\u2019s tax guy. The email explained that I had done my taxes incorrectly and claimed too much based on my income. He also said that he would need me to file an amendment in order for my dad to claim me as a dependent. \n\nThe previous year I had been an independent contractor and had anticipated having to pay a lot back in taxes this year. Fortunately, my grandma was able to help me file my taxes on TurboTax and claim my education credit as well as some healthcare costs which gave me a tax refund.\n\nBased on my age and living situation, I know that my dad is unable to claim me as a dependent on his taxes. My parents do still have me on their phone plan and their HINS plan (I also have my own health ins.) but I do pay for everything else. \n\nI assumed that my dad\u2019s tax guy was not aware of this information, and for fear of my taxes being changed and refund being revoked, I responded to his email and told him this. He responded back saying that he disagreed with me, but that he would not file the amendment.\n\nToday, I get an angry call from my dad asking what happened between me and his tax guy. I explained the interaction and my dad asked me to forward him the emails, explaining to me that his tax guy is refusing to work with him because I was rude to him.\n\nI am dumbfounded by this and gladly forward the messages to my dad. If anything, the tone of his original email came off as a little rude to me in that he was listing off all the things I did wrong when filing and how he wanted me to correct them. I responded saying that to my knowledge, it was incorrect of my dad to claim me on his taxes. This seemed to have ruffled some feathers and although I can acknowledge that I should have asked some more clarifying questions before sending my response, I don\u2019t think what I said should have caused this issue.\n\nMy dad\u2019s tax guy is offended that \u201ca 24yo girl is trying to tell him how to do his job\u201d and is refusing to work for my dad unless I apologize to him. I\u2019m happy to apologize if it means my dad gets to keep his tax guy, but I cant help but think this guy is unprofessional for beefing with me over taxes and is willing to lose a client over this situation. \n\nMy dad acknowledges that I may be correct in him not technically being able to claim me, although it would provide him a major tax break if he did, and has agreed to match the difference if it ends up affecting my refund.
