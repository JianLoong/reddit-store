You got this!!", "If you're Orthodox Jewish (this seems possible from your post), contact Footsteps.", "I don't know if anyone else has told you this because I have not read all the comments, but I just wanted to tell you that you should feel proud of yourself. You just threw open the door for your other siblings and other girls in your religious community. As crummy as your situation is, they now will feel like they CAN break away if they want to.", "Fortunately OP didn't say anything about an older brother with ill-defined boundaries.", "That whole family make my skin crawl", "This sounds more like Islam to me than cuckoo Crizzo stuff. The whole family shaming, sisters can't get married now, etc. Sadly this is extremely common in many Muslim countries. I hope OP stays away. NTA.", "You see, there was a kitten dangling from a branch halfway down a cliff over a shark-infested pit of lava, and the only way to descend was aerial silks. I had to use my sister's hairspray to increase hand friction, and even though I saved the kitten, I feel bad for having to use an aerosol and endangering the planet. AITA?\n\nJokes aside, people coming from abusive situations often have trouble seeing things that seem obvious to us, which is why OP is usually NTA and it's hard to think otherwise. I do think more objective titles would be better\u2014'AITA for leaving my abusive religous family and causing them trouble,' for instance, is an actual summary of the situation and far more useful for judgement.", "Honestly, my first thought when reading the title was, \"Is that you, Lydia Bennett?\"", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "\"AITA for depleting the ozone layer and giving everybody on Earth lead poisoning?\"\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Midgley_Jr.", "This, sadly there are people who would take advantage of your vulnerable position and exploit your gratitude for their help. I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t trust anyone but just be careful going forward how much power anyone has over you. Good luck", "Yes to this. Don\u2019t trust people too much. Make sure a college counselor knows what\u2019s going on. Maybe get a social worker.  Save your money.", "There are plenty of anti-women nutjobs running Christian religions.", "My first thought was Christian fundies.", "That\u2019s a big jump. Lots of Christian sects fit this as well.", "I get it, sort of. I grew up in an ultra Orthodox Jewish community and having a non religious family member, or even a sick (serious physical illness or mental illness) family member can negatively affect marriage prospects. Not that those will make it impossible to marry but it will have an effect.", "I never got how anyone could be considered \u201cnot good enough\u201d when most of the New Testament consists of letters written by a man who once killed Christians on behalf of the Roman Empire.", "I wonder if OP is from the US or not. Their profile has nothing on it... obviously doesn't affect NTA status, but I'd be curious to know.", "Which Duggar do you think wrote this? \ud83d\ude05", "Orthodox Jewish and Chasidism too.

Not the lava sharks.\n\nOn a serious note, as someone who grew up in difficult circumstances, I was so used to being the servant and providing at a young age with risk of serious threats from a parent who was mentally unwell and undiagnosed and untreated, it took 15 years before I could see things clearly. It really annoys me when people have a go at the person on AITA for being a doormat because many people did not grow up in happy homes and you can\u2019t see what others do until you have been out, had a chance to recover and and reflect and rebuild your worldview. It\u2019s tough.", "Nah I have seen similar titles in post having nothing to do with family or abuse \"aita for destroying a kid's visit in Disneyland?\" --> they didn't allow a late coming family to take their front row during fireworks.

At the very least, I don't known any MO that would disallow secular books.\n\nI'd argue most chassidic sects are also more flexible - hassidic women have been doctors, judges, etc. I'm not saying there aren't issues, but ops post feels a bit to restrictive for anything except maybe satmar.", "Telltale on YouTube is an ex-JW who gives a lot of good advice too.", "Leaving Eden also! One of the hosts is ex-Independent Fundamental Baptist, the other is her good friend. They've lately had some \"how-to\" episodes on doing secular things like dancing, dating, drinking alcohol, stuff that is forbidden in these sects.", "The girls were allowed to as long as they became Midwives.", "OP was allowed to go to college ..I can see Jim Duggar completely flipping out and disowning one of his daughters if she dared to enroll in college classes . And the girls that claim they were midwives never really went to school for it ..Arkansas has some weird laws around that and they basically were required to have a REAL midwife with them and they were more like assistants who had gotten the lowest level of training", "Well yeah, he couldn't have his precious virgins go to real Midwife school and learn how babies are made."]}
