My mum likes to say that she has \"inherited\" her friend's adult son (30m).\n\nThe problem is this. Whenever I've seen this guy, he's been drunk or gotten drunk. I don't mean slightly tipsy. I mean can't walk straight, slurs his words drunk. He gets weirdky touchy with my mum, which I can tell makes her uncomfortable. A while ago he picked me up from work because busdrivers were on strike and he was drinking behind the wheel.\n\nHe also has stumps for teeth, dirty fingers (I don't think he ever showers or washes his hands. He stinks) and basically just acts like stereotypical white trash, except we're not even american.\n\nI already don't like him the few times I've seen him sober, but when he's drunk he triggers the fuck out of me. My mum was a drunk for most of my childhood and when I stayed with my grandparents for a while, they were both drunk half the time, too.\n\nMy mum is sober now, but I feel that because she's sober she's decided I'm no longer allowed to have a problem with my childhood. I mentioned a few times that this man triggers me and she keeps coming up with excuses, mostly \"I can't just not talk to him anymore. He's (best friend)'s son.\"\n\nI pay half the rent and utilities. My name is on the renting contract along with my mum's. I feel I am entitled to feel safe in my own home.\n\nMy mum absolutely would not be able to afford the rent on this, or any, place if I moved out. She works part time because of progressive rheumanoid arthritis and doesn't make a livable wage.\n\nBut I have a lead on a place and I've seriously been considering moving out due to some personal reasons (location, mostly), some things I disagree with in the house (rules. no alone time. no privacy), but mostly because of this: she is making the situation feel unsafe for me by allowing this man to be in our lives.\n\nSo today, after drunk dude had been over again, I told my mother the following:\n\n\"I understand that you feel you are responsible for (his name), but you are not his mother. You are my mother, and you are making me afraid in my own home. If (he) comes over again, I'll be moving to (nearby city) to be closer to work.\"\n\nMy mum lost it at me, called me heartless and cold and said I don't understand what it's like to lose someone. Now I feel like an asshole. Am I?\n\nETA:\n\nMore reasons for me to move out:\n\n-I'll be closer to work.\n-I'll live in a safer location, because our neighbourhood is really shitty.\n-I'll have more privacy.\n-My mum won't throw \"my house, my rules\" at me.\n-I'll be allowed to have my friends over whenever I want.\n-I'll be allowed to eat what I want, instead of having to eat unhealthy junkfood every night because that's what my mum makes.\n\nReasons I haven't moved out:\n\n-My mum can't afford to live without me.\n-Rent here is cheap. We live in a shitty village in a shit part of the village so rent is relatively cheap anyway, but half of that is even cheaper.

Your mum is grieving, and you have to take that into account because right now it's driving her actions. This man is the only link to her friend, and she might feel comforted by his presence so is ignoring all his negative actions. That doesn't mean you have to tolerate him or his alcoholism. \n\nIt sounds like you're in the UK, so maybe it would be useful to check the DWP website or contact your local Welfare Rights service and see if your mum is entitled to any benefits. She might be able to get some form of disability benefit, working tax credit and/or help with housing costs.\n\nYou don't have to stay in a home where you feel unsafe and uncomfortable, especially given your lived experience around alcoholism. You have every right to expect to live in a safe, supportive environment, and that isn't happening right now. There comes a time when you have to say \"I love you but I have to go for my own sake.\" It sounds like that time is now.\n\nYour mum might be grieving, but that doesn't give her the right to put your safety in jeopardy. And since she has Drunk Guy around, what does she need you there for, if he's fulfilling this need she has to feel connected to her friend? \n\nHaving him there is her decision to make, and if there are any adverse consequences, like her housing situation becoming precarious or her sobriety being endangered, that's her lookout. She's an adult and her choices are hers to make. If they lead to adverse consequences, that's not your problem. You can understand why she's making poor decisions; you don't, however, have to stay in an unsafe place and abide by them.", "\"shitshow\" is the right word for it. NTA. This man has already endangered you once by drink driving. \n\nYour mum is, I'm sure, projecting, as she identifies with the man. She therefore has to make herself believe that this isn't that big of a deal - if she accepts that this man in dangerous, she has to acknowledge that SHE was a danger to you. \n\nIt's okay to let go, and keep yourself safe. It's also your responsibility to do so.", "NTA. You have a right to feel safe. Also, dude is 30! It\u2019s not like he is still a minor and needs a caretaker. If mom keeps letting him come around, despite it making you uncomfortable, and either won\u2019t limit his visit time to when you aren\u2019t around or stop the visits, it\u2019s clear she WANTS him around and daughter be damned. To be a little fair, mom may be missing her friend so much that dude is a way for her to still feel connected to her friend.", "NTA. Move out. You have no idea the level of freedom and liberation you\u2019ll have when you do. This was the last straw, use it. Your mother is a grown ass adult and I promise you, she\u2019ll manage. Let go of guilt, it\u2019s a useless feeling. Move to a place of your own, with your beautiful privacy, close to your job, where you can be rid of your past and triggers. You\u2019ll be so happy!", "NTA. Your mother is putting this old sot ahead of her own son. And her house her rules, yet it's your house too. Her rules are super restricting considering you're an adult. It's time for you to fly the coop, so get out there and start living your best life on your own terms.", "NTA\n\nI am getting second hand triggered on your behalf. Not being allowed to say anything about someone's alcohol problem, especially from childhood, really builds up in a person's system. Your feelings are absolutely a valid reason to move out, this isn't the quality of life you should have to live when you have options. \n\nYou weren't born for the purpose of securing her housing. Life is tough and we should look out for each other when we can, but in her choice to have you, she took on the caring responsibility, not you. Arguably, now you're over 18 that responsibility isn't as valid, but it certainly should not be reversed onto you to make sure there is a roof over your mother's head whilst willingly accepting any and all crap from her end. You're both adults, and you don't have to look after someone who doesn't look after you. \n\nMy only tip is that ultimatums weren't helpful when dealing with my mum. I just got the accusation of trying to control her. In the end I accepted that I was never going to get a change in her behaviour, I looked at the situation for what it was, and then just moved from there. \n\nIts so hard when its your mum and the traditional societal view is that you owe mums everything, but not every mum is amazing. If this were a boyfriend, there wouldn't even be a question about nopeing the fuck out of there. Sending love x", "NTA. I think you should move already, but I understand giving her a chance.", "NTA. Get out of there!", "Move out NTA", "NTA,\nYou should feel secure in your own home especially since you\u2019re paying for half of it, you should have a say. \n\nAND, \nYour mum is your mum, her priority should be her child and their safety, not another persons child. She is not responsible for the life or death of her best friend, so she has no obligation to look after the son.\n\nAlso, call the cops next time he\u2019s drinking and driving, he\u2019s going to unalive someone or at least maim them and it\u2019ll eat your conscience if you know and did nothing. It may be the wake up call he needs.", "Your mum can't afford to live without you.

Your mum is a recovering alcoholic\n\n2. Her parents were alcoholics \n\n3. Her best friend's son is an alcoholic \n\nWould I also conclude that her best friend was also an alcoholic? Does your mum know anybody besides you who isn't?", "NAH. You don't get to dictate who your mom has over. \n\nYou are Codependent with your mom. Red flags are that you think she needs you. No, if you died today, she'd be able to take care of herself. She can get another roommate or move elsewhere and rent a room. \n\nStop being codependent and move out and stop interfering in your mom,'s life. Mind your own business. \n\nRead up on Codependency- books, youtubes, etc. \n\nSounds like you could use support for adult children of alcoholics. AL-ANON or similar. \n\nWe all need to learn to set and maintain healthy boundaries with our parents. Watch youtubes to learn how. \n\nWhere is your dad? If he's so great, then I can see why you hold resentment toward your mom. If he's not great, go take some of your anger out on him. Mom shouldn't get it all. \n\nAlso, alcoholism is a disease. So get counseling and stop being codependent or you could fall into addiction, too, since it runs in families. Also, knowing this means your mom didn't try to be in her addiction. Although it still was painful for you.", "In my country when you move addresses but someone stays behind, you're automatically removed. That's not a problem.", "You worded yourself beautifully, you don't deserve to be afraid in your own home.

But I would never allow her to move into the place I have my eyes on. There's only one bedroom, for one. We'd kill each other.", "I had to google what IASIP meant. But no, I wish. Like I said, he comes off as a stereotype.", "I don't like to think of it as an ultimatum, but you're right. I think after she's calmed down some I'll talk to her again. If that doesn't work I'll move.", "I do think my mum is really missing her friend. Also I'm a dude, fyi", "I don't really view it as an ultimatum. If she wants to see him that's fine. I'm not trying to tell her what she can and can't do.\n\nI am away from home for work 55 hours a week. She works from home 20 hours. We clean together on saturdays (easier bc of her arthritis to do it together so I can do the heavy lifting) but she cooks, so let's say that takes an hour every day I'm at work. That leaves her with 30 hours where she can literally do whatever she wants. She can have whoever she wants over when I'm not there, in my opinion. I'm not allowed to have people over when she's home, either. I'm just asking her not to have a drunk over.", "Genuinely, if she can agree to this one thing I'll stay. I'll pay the price of being treated mostly like a teenager if it means I can keep saving to ultimately buy a house instead of having to rent. (because renting sucks)\n\nThat being said, I'm not willing to feel (or be) unsafe for the cause.\n\nAlso lets be honest. There's some definite pros to being treated like a teenager as well. Like I pay rent and utilities and half of the groceries, but I only cook once a week. I don't worry about any of the planning because she handles it and as long as I make sure she has my half of the bills before a certain date, she handles the finances and that's been going just fine. It's not exactly a punishment to not have to worry about that stuff. Also means I get to save and still have a nice amount of money to spend, because my mum isn't exactly bad with money (unless she wants to be) and has helped me make a saving plan.", "To clarify: the drunk doesn't live with us. He just comes over and hangs out.\n\nAlso, we don't live in a slum. My country doesn't have slums. It's not a great area, but it's definitely far from a slum.\n\nI am also not just choosing to keep living here out of the kindness of my own heart or whatever. If she would agree to do this one thing, it would remain beneficial for both of us. I'm trying to save up to buy a house and she needs a roommate to be able to afford rent.", "Thanks for the info. Doesn't really apply here, but I assume it comes from a good place.\n\nI don't resent my mother for her alcoholism btw. I only resent her for pretending like she was never an alcoholic. But we've been in therapy together already and I understand that she was sick and that it wasn't her fault. She also got sober for me, and I respect the hell out of her for that. It would probably be loads easier to drink the literal pain in her entire body away.", "Then move! It will be better for you.", "son*", "Your mom is still in denial, a lot of alcoholics also grew up as codependent to alcoholic or addict family members or friends. She's not only denying the present by insisting this is an acceptable situation but she's denying the past by pretending all was well. She's never actually dealt with her problems, and I think you are insightful enough to recognize that. I'm so sorry, man, alcoholism affects so many people around the alcoholic.", "Then your mom will do everything possible to insist how it's too small for you, etc.  She'll probably also get any other extended family members to add to your harassment.\n\nShe'll harass and pressure you to get a bigger place.

And too many of us allow our parents shit affect us for too long, because it\u2019s hard breaking things off - but you need to move on. Whatever she says!", "Maybe wrong word choice from me there, read instead as setting boundaries. Its just in any person who is not ready to deal with the consequences of their actions (which it sounds like your mum might be - not able to talk about her behaviour in your childhood, this situation), anything that sounds remotely like the consequences of their own actions will get twisted. Your request is so far from unreasonable and it sounds like you're giving her a lot more room than she gives you, but in someone who isn't ready to change they're still going to play the victim. You're already bending over backwards to accommodate her and it still isn't enough. It may just be easier to start making decisions without involving her. My boundaries with my mum had to be completely on me, ie *I* would leave the room if she started drinking, rather than her stopping drinking.

I've been moved out before and our relationship actually got lots better at that time. Granted, back then she still had a fulltime job.
