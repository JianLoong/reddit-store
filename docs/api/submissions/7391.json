You ignored her when she said she was uncomfortable. You ignored her when she said she didn't want either mother helping. Having a body there wasn't what she wanted. She wanted *you* there.  So it looks like you did anything you could to just leave the second you could. You weren't listening.\n\nMany new parents are uncomfortable with the other being far away when their babies are so young. That's normal and natural. At this stage she's still recovering from childbirth. Not everyone has a set comfort zone with their parenting yet. It can be really intimidating having your support out of range.\n\nThis is an event that is special though. She should have worked with you a bit more on how to make it so she was comfortable with the idea, like you attending part of it if it was multiple days, checking in more frequently, her having a close friend with her, or even her and the baby going to the city and staying separately. I know a lot of women that have done the last one. Having a parent there is usually more hassle because many women jump into that host mode and don't get to just simply *be* in their own home, so friends are usually better options.", "YTA \n\nYou have a newborn at home and your wife and baby should be your priority right now, it\u2019s that simple.", "You left your wife at home with your newborn (towns away apparently) to go to a party?

Yes you gave her options, but none of those options was her husband staying home to be with her. Having your mom or her mom there is different to having you there. You\u2019re her husband, you are her safe space. She would feel confident and comfortable having you around because the way you make her feel is different to the way anyone else can and you weren\u2019t there. \n\nI say this because that\u2019s how I felt when my partner left me feeling this way.", "YTA\n\nYou have a newborn, your brother wanting you to be towns away from your wife and new baby does not take priority over you being a husband and father.

If it wasn\u2019t your brother I\u2019d say YTA. Inviting moms is not necessarily helpful and you probably know this. Having a newborn is a rough/magical time. Especially your first.

Certainly family/close friend life events are a big enough deal that your spouse needs to make do, and this one qualifies. You would presumably do the same for her.

Was this a drinking and golfing trip, or strippers and escorts?\n\nConsidering that you found additional help for your wife, I\u2019m going with NTA.

Your wife may not be comfortable with other people around the baby or around her right now, or she may just really want her partner to be with her. She may just want to feel like baby care is more equal, she may be resentful of you not being tethered to the baby when she is. Or it could be something entirely different, there's no way to know without being in your situation.   \n\nHow long were you gone, and did you then support your wife in having the same amount of time away from the baby to do something like a spa day, can she even do that based on how your baby is fed and how often?         \n\nThe newborn stage is hard and is an important stage for parents to still remember there's more to life than a screaming baby, but it needs to be equal and it needs to be a joint effort.", "YTA. She wants you home to raise your newborn. You are a father and should prioritize your newborn over other events. The timing sucks but she is emotionally and physically fragile from giving birth so recently. She doesn't want to deal with her mom or your mom, she wants her husband.", "NTA. Compromise is essential to a marriage. This wasn\u2019t a random meal but a bachelors party being spoken off", "NTA. I don't think this will be the last time she tries to \"not allow\" you to do things. You offered solutions which were legit and she turned them down because she wanted to control you. Then she played the refusing to talk to you game like a child.", "NTA like, obviously, it can suck to be left with full care of house/pets/newborn but I give an instant pass for infrequent (potentially once in a lifetime) major events, especially with immediate family. \n\nShe also had the option of two separate other people to help her, which she refused, which tells me she wants to seem like the victim more than she legit needed help.", "NTA.   \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a random party.

I also offered to have the baby for a night alone so she could have a night out with her friends. \n\nTalk to your partner and get to the bottom of her concerns.

You even try to find her a substitute, the fact that she declined indicates, that she was confident enough to care for herself and the baby.", "So, not sure what my verdict is, I would like more information. You say \u201cbachelor party\u201d but that can be many things. What activities were there? Was it a good meal, some drinks, some light gambling? Or where there strippers or was it at a strip club? Because those are very different parties. And if it was strippers, then her objection could have been the strippers (and you would be TA by ignoring her feelings on the matter).

There are very few events that I think would be alright to attend with a newborn at home, and your brothers Bachelor party is one of them.

People are discussing both you being unavailable for childcare, and the health risks of going out in public.  But with one or both grandmas there to help, it seems like childcare wouldn't be an issue.

Combine that with an infant who is awake every 2 to 3 hours and can take half hour to feed. That alone is exhausting both physically and psychologically. \nI know I didn't want help even though I needed it because there's this massive guilt effect when mums \"can't do it all\".

With minimal sleep and a tint person who is completely and entirely dependent on their parent. Then having her own mother or your mother come in and give criticism or unwanted advice while hormones are all over the place. Yeah, no.\n\nYTA, not because you want to go out with your brother for his bachelor party because thats understandable, but because it sounds like you didn't compromise or try to understand.

Your wife is likely still recovering from childbirth and surgery (if she had a c-section). A lot of women can't even go to the bathroom without excruciating pain after giving birth. She may still be wearing diapers, dealing with leaking boobs, learning to take care of a newborn, feeling overwhelmed with the adjustment, all on barely any sleep. If something were to happen, you would presumably be hours away. What if one of her stitches starts bleeding again while the baby is crying or hungry? What if she needs to eat, but she hasn't been able to set the crying baby down?

You offered to send your mother and her mother, but she was still fixated on just you rather than recognizing the alternative forms of support she could have.\n\n\n3) Don't listen to these comments about the baby's health. They are all helicopter parent quacks\n\nThe idea that babies have to stay inside the house for several weeks after they're born is FALSE. In fact, as long as your baby is healthy, getting some fresh air can be great for mom and baby if you take a few precautions.\n\nDuring the last 3 months of pregnancy, antibodies from mothers are passed to their unborn babies through the placenta. This is passive immunity as they are given antibodies rather than producing their own.\n\nImmunity in newborn babies is only temporary and starts to decrease after the first few weeks or months, but breast milk also contains antibodies, which means that babies who are breastfed have passive immunity for longer.\n\nThere's no way to prevent your baby from getting sick, try to stay away from places where you know there are people who are sick and take precautions like washing hands, limiting exposure until you feel comfortable enough etc...\n\n\n4) Was there any complications to her birth? Was her pregnancy not easy?

That\u2019s why we don\u2019t vaccinate until month 6 ish, because the moms IgG will just destroy the vaccine with no actual immune response.\n\nSo babies do have an immune response prior to 6 months, it\u2019s just not entirely their own at that point.\n\nEdit: to clarify we do vaccinate earlier than 6 months, it\u2019s more so that the vaccines aren\u2019t considered sufficient until the last dose is administered at 6 months because doses 1 and two around 3 months don\u2019t elicit sufficient immune response.", "Also, is this just the tip of the iceberg? How many other times has he left his wife to take care of the newborn while he went out and had fun?", "Exactly! Caring for a newborn when you\u2019re in that fourth trimester is exhausting.

Now", "who would waist their time on that? i say that as someone who wrights fanfic only formyself. so i get having weird hobbies. but this seems like it would take away from people that actualy want assistance", "Wait are you saying that the default Reddit advice of \u201cget a divorce\u201d isn\u2019t good advice? /s", "Ugh every time someone posts a picture of their pet they can\u2019t just say they got them at a shelter or pet store. No it\u2019s always some harrowing tale of this dog was found starving in a dumpster, this cat was nearly frozen to death on my doorstep so I rescued her.", "So many stitches! My first baby was vacuum-assisted and hoo buddy. This comment section is bringing back all the memories", "I'd be pissed newborns have no immune system and offering other people's help with what you should do is another slap in the face.", "Yta I would have left my partner if he did this to me when our son was a new born.", "Yeah, you are.", "You're a parent. That means your priorities must change, or you will be (are) a shitty parent.\n\nYTA.", "You prioritized your brothers party over your wife and newborn.\n\nWhy is this even a post? You should know the answer.", "Even if you didn\u2019t have the newborn, respect your wife enough not to go.", "The lack of response makes me think it's either fake, or hopefully he's not wasting time commenting bc he's groveling and begging for forgiveness for being so selfish. YTA, but hopefully lesson learned.", "I work in pediatrics and am seeing a wave of newborn infants admitted to the PICU after holiday get-togethers. And plenty more are discharged from the ED to home care because they\u2019re at capacity and can only take the sickest kids.\n\nYTA. If I had a newborn at home and it was a \u201cbig deal\u201d to my brother that I come to his bachelor party, I would say \u201cSorry dude, it\u2019s a big deal to keep my kid healthy\u201d. Any reasonable adult should be able to understand that caring for your newborn child and exhausted wife is a bigger priority.", "YTA", "YTA. You have a fucking new born. It\u2019s dad time now.", "Why is it so hard for you listen to your kid literally has no immune system. The best they have is what they receive from your wife when she breast feeds. Yet you find it more important to go to a possible cesspool of bacteria diseases and other things that could irreparably harm your kid. The definite answer her is YTA.", "You\u2019re not answering any questions, likely because they\u2019ll make you look worse. YTA. You should be with your recovering wife and newborn-who has no immune system, btw. Hope you didn\u2019t bring anything back.", "Assuming the baby is less than 4 months old, YTA. Your wife is likely still recovering from birth, an out of town bachelor party isn't appropriate.", "YTA. Even if your baby wasn\u2019t a newborn, leaving out of town to have fun while expecting your wife to stay behind and tend to the child is selfish.", "YTA.  You prioritized your brother over your wife and son.  \"Can I travel for funsies while we have a newborn at home?\" is a two yeses, one no situation.", "I think YTA regardless of the info we are missing, just based on how you talk about the situation. For you, there was a problem and you \"fixed it\" by inviting over your mom and then hers. She wasn't included in this \"solution\" at all. When having a disagreement with your partner, you both need to be a part of the discussion to find a solution you are both happy with. You made decisions for your wife and decided they were good enough with no regard to how she felt about it. She probably doesn't feel like an equal party in your relationship, or that you respect her. And from the way you talk about her I'm not sure you do. Talk to your wife like an equal and start including her in decision making.", "Fucking troll\nYTA", "Yta. Postpartum is so hard and in those first weeks of your wife says she needs you, then she and your baby come first.", "YTA. Adapting to parenthood is hard af, especially for Mom. And bachelor parties are stupid. Folks haven\u2019t been single since they met their partner. Grow up.", "Yes. You're married. Stop looking at other women.", "Yta, I was in a similar situation and made it work. We had a Airbnb and the rest of the guys stayed there overnight and I ended up driving home the two nights we were staying at the house, it was about 30 mins each way. Nighttime was the worst time since our 16 month old wasn\u2019t sleeping through the night.", "How long were you gone for? And how old is the newborn?", "Yep, grow  boyman", "Reading these comments makes me sick\u2026 you did nothing wrong. Please remember Reddit as a whole is hard left and thus the woman is always right. Cause we both know if this post was reversed\u2026. I the mother of a newborn needed some time to relax by myself because of the stress but my boyfriend disagreed all the comments would be the exact opposite\u2026..", "NTA - its your brother and one of the more important moments in family life.   \n\n\nyour wife is acting as if you grabbed your brothers hand instead of her holding your son when they are all dangling off a cliff.\n\n  \nthis isnt the case, you made sure your family was taken care of so you could live your life.  \n\n\nhaving a family shouldnt mean you arent allowed to make other things important, and you even did what you could to make sure their needs were met.", "NTA people need to chill out, it was one night. Doesn't matter how young the newborn is. Bachelors party only happens once", "YTA: the baby comes first", "11 hours, no answer. Which means he knows the answers are not in his favor.", "I\u2019m just gonna say\u2026I planned a fishing trip with my brother a month before my baby is born (with approval) knowing damn well I can\u2019t do shit for a hot minute after its born. I\u2019ll leave it at that I guess. Post baby is a two person job (pre baby is too), and she took the brunt of it. Ya gotta be around.\n\nShe\u2019s tired. She\u2019s nursing. She being a mom. And you\u2019re shot gunning beers throwing bean bags in a hole. Communication is key here because ya might get the trip but you have to respect what she wants when it comes to this.", "If it was just a night out with the boys, I'd completely agree, but dude's brother is getting married. It's a big deal. Yes, having a newborn at home is also a big deal, but that baby is still going to be there the next day when he gets back, while this will be the only time he gets to go to his own brother's bachelor party. Maybe he's kind of an asshole for not working something out with his wife, but he did try to, and her refusal to offer any solutions makes her an AH in my opinion.", "I mean\u2026 I\u2019m assuming he and his wife are both going to the wedding so\u2026.", "First chance he got huh? Where in between the lines did you read that?", "This \"no immune system for an six months\" meaning you have to stay with your child every night is wild a d absurd. Nearly every baby that has ever lived was raised outside or in a place without plumbing. And, for the very short time that homes and plumbing have been available for some children, they have been in really shitty condition.\n\nBabies are insanely resilient. And plenty survive without ever breastfeeding!\n\nYours is a shitty take. \n\nThe wife is in the wrong here. If it was a college friend or something, then maybe. But, you don't stop celebrating your families big life events because you have a baby.\n\nAnd, for the record, I'm a parent of two kids.", "I agree mostly, but going to your siblings bachelor party is not the same as jumping and running to a party at the first chance he gets. \n\nAlso as far as I can read the wife didn't want him to invite HIS mom. Whether or not she was on board with her mom isn't clear from this post, so you can't really say he went over her head against her wishes there.", "If he does that, guaranteed we\u2019ll see: \u201cAITA for asking for compensation for babysitting over the weekend?\u201d\n(Conveniently omitting the fact that the child would be in fact\u2026 his)", "His wife might not want a night out to \u201chave fun\u201d. To her, caring for her baby might be the most fulfilling activity. It wouldn\u2019t really be a fair trade then. Please don\u2019t assume you know what a new mother wants or needs.", "Thank you\u2026. Definitely lost a tad bit of faith in humanity considering how far down I had to scroll to find this. I hope OP sees this", "You're TA for assuming every bachelor party is strippers, wth, lol.", "Isn\u2019t newborn under 6 weeks old? If it were my second or third baby I\u2019d be fine, but my first born I was floundering and needed my husband in those first 6 weeks. I would have also been uncomfortable with him taking a weekend away just to party", "It makes me wonder if this is the same guy who wanted to use two weeks of his FML to visit his family across country.", "I think people are erring on the side of asshole specifically because OP is leaving some of these very big and important questions unanswered. It\u2019s kind of suspicious, like OP is trying to phrase things in the most generous possible way for himself.", "EXACTLY!", "The subreddit seems to have tipped into being very quick to say everyone is the a H these days.", "Ha ha ha ha. No.", "Very simple. One is needed, the other is not. But this is still a shit argument for the thread.\n\nThe reality is. The info that is needed is why did he feel obligated to choose his brothers party over his family?. He said his brother really wanted him there, so he better have a good reason. If his brothers reason was that just because the party would be more fun with him, its complete bs. His brother and him are the asshole.", "\"I need more info. Was the baby born yesterday? Does it have a disease requiring 24 hour care? Is the mother a quadriplegic?\"\n\njfc, it's one damned night. I've had kids. One parent should be OK with the other taking a night to do something important like this. In the grand scheme of being a parent, one night is nothing, even after just having a baby.\n\nSomething tells me this would be different if the mother had asked for the father for a night free to go to a bachelorette party.", "I was fine physically after a couple weeks but emotionally a disaster for MONTHS.

He was sent home with a full week supply of opioids because he was, \u201cIn the worst pain of his life.\u201d I was treated like an addict when I asked for something stronger than Tylenol while still in the hospital after giving birth.

Frequently engaging in thought experiments meant to elicit judgments regarding complex moral situations I think is valuable to building worthwhile character.

I'm sure this isn't all doctors but it's still too many. \n\nKind of a tangent but if you're having a biopsy done anywhere other than your cervix, you get pain management, no question. You'd be crazy if you DIDN'T want it. At the obgyn I had to request it and they even shamed me for being \"difficult\"\n\nI never felt like less of an autonomous human being than I did in that situation. Can't even imagine how dehumanizing it must feel to go through a c section and be told Tylenol should be good enough."]}
