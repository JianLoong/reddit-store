She's adamant that they haven spoken in almost a year when the records says otherwise. I asked her to have him call me but he said he owes me no explanation. I went to where he lives to pick up my phone. He came out but refused to hand it over. He didn't apologize. She was in my car, but instead of giving me an explanation, she kept saying things to soothe him and console him.\u00a0 I locked and erased his phone and he went crazy. He had a full blown tantrum and tried to ram himself against my car. I dropped her off and left. I locked and erased the laptop that I'd loaned her and disabled the cloud I'd been helping her pay because they're using me. Now her son is accusing me of destroying his father's life by having him lose all his data and missing out on getting back on his feet.

I've known him for years, and despite our friendship ending in a negative note, I've never seen him with a meltdown. All I asked was to be kept out of all his business dealings, but it sounds like everything fell thru for him and it's not something I wanted. \nI also told her that I would disable her phone if she kept bringing him up. I'm angry that he ended up using the phone AND my laptop but maybe I should have been less harsh. He has a history of needing praise and approval so I guess his meltdown was because he felt humiliated.

Is OP trying to help her friend or control her? There are so many strings attached to her help that it feels ridiculous. I too have friends who either have bad habits or keep bad company. I'm not thrilled but I understand that my friends are flawed and sometimes weak, as am I. OP can't realistically change her friend and to even try is foolhardy. She's trying to control a huge chunk of her friend's life as a condition of paying for her phone plan? Is this for real? I think OP should decide how much help she can afford to write off and give it with no strings attached. If I have a friend in need, I will help them if they can, no questions asked. If the amount of help that is needed is going to seriously trouble me then the answer is no. OP's friend has issues that only committed work with a therapist can solve.
