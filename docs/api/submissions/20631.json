I think that seeing someone who can help you unpack all of these feelings is extremely important. You suffered a great loss losing your mother and now seeing your father be the man he should have been is causing great turmoil inside of you. You will miss out on so much in life if you do not work though your feelings.", "NAH - you need grief counseling to help you through the loss of your mother.  And I am so terribly sorry for your loss.  I lost my dad when I was 11, it took a really long time for me to get my head on right afterward.\n\nYou're maybe too young to know this, but nobody ever knows everything that happens inside a marriage except for the 2 people in it.  Maybe your parents weren't completely happy together.  I mean, you said they had an okay relationship and that every family hangout ended in arguments.  That's not anybody's fault, it sounds like maybe they were trying to make things work for your sake.  And yes, I'm speculating, but that's honestly what it sounds like to me.\n\nBut it sounds like your dad is happier now.  And that is not an insult to your mom, sometimes people just work better with some people than with others.  I'm guessing that's the case here with him and your step-mom.  And like other people have said, maybe he's trying to make up for what he didn't do when he was married to your mom.\n\nMy recommendation here is to get counseling and talk to that person about all of this.  Try giving your dad and step-mom a chance.  Don't compare it to what you've experienced in the past, this could be a new chapter - one where you get to see what your dad is like as a happy person, and what your life could be like when he's happy and engaged.  Best wishes.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your mom. But please take this lesson with you in life as you begin to enter relationships. \n\nWhen a partner wants to, they will. Your Dad is living proof of that. \n\nYou have a direct view into how people treat the people they like and how they treat people they don\u2019t really like.", "NTA. I can understand why you feel like this.\n\n>My dad thinks I am being dramatic and told me to get over it and that I am missing out\u2026\n\nYour mother missed out for years but he was fine with that. Has he offered any explanation for the difference in his treatment of them?", "Your parents exposed the weaknesses in their relationship to you as a child, and now on top of that, you're (seemingly) still grieving the loss of your mother. This is a hard place to be, and the way you feel is very normal for the circumstances.\n\nYour father is also in a difficult place with this - he can't change the past, and the true reasons he wasn't doing these activities with your mother may have been beyond his control too. Nonetheless, he shouldn't be dismissive of what you're going through. This aspect is why I'd call this NTA instead of N A H.\n\nWithdrawing from these activities may feel good at times, but if you can stomach it, I recommend going. If you can't, try to find something else you'll enjoy. Live the way your mother would want you to live, and be proud for doing so.", "I'm not going to call you an *asshole* for it, but I have a feeling that the change in your father is because he *regrets* the way he treated your mother. He probably thought something like\u2014I'm so busy, it can wait, let me work hard and save money now, and we can travel all we want to when we retire. \n\nThen she passed away long before that day came. \n\nSo now he's resolved to do better with his children\u2014and his new wife. \n\nI'm sure your mother would want you to enjoy yourself and to become closer to your father\u2014I mean, that's what she was always pushing for, right? For your dad to spend more time with you? \n\nAs the saying goes, don't cut off your nose to spite your face. Not participating in family activities won't help your mother now, only harm you.", "Info\n\nI need to know the dad's reasoning. Did he realize he was wrong and wants a second chance to get it right? If that's the case, wouldn't mom want OP to give dad a chance? Or was mom and dads marriage loveless, was he there just to \"do the right thing\"?", "NAH\n\nJust talk to your dad. It\u2019s really that easy. Maybe he realized he was wrong to not enjoy spending time together and he has massive regret from your mom passing. \n\nI understand where you\u2019re coming from, though. Just sit down and talk through it. You will both come out the other side with a better understanding.", "NTA. You are absolutely within your right to feel your feelings. I'm so sorry for the loss of your mom. If you have a therapist / school counselor you can talk to, reach out. It does help with the grief and the anger of how your dad is treating his new wife. I'm going through the same thing as an adult, and it is hard to see your step parent get everything your parent never got. Hang in there - and be true to you.", "NTA but also. Your dad lost his wife to cancer and has changed ostensibly for the better, by your account in a way his late wife would have wanted, I see why you feel hurt but consider that he might have some regrets about his first marriage he doesn\u2019t want for his second", "NTA. I would sit down and talk to your dad about it, why is he doing all this stuff with new wife but didn't make an effort with your mom? Talk to him and see what he says.", "Absolutely NTA", "NTA", "NAH- it sounds like your mom's death may have made your dad realize that he shouldn't be delaying these fun things for \"tomorrow\" because that time isn't a guaruntee.  It's also a different time in his life. Having older, teenage children usually gives parents more flexibility for leisure.\n\nI think the way your dad was with your mom was just a symptom of them being in a busier/more stressful time in life and the thought that he had more time together than they ended up with. \n\nBut you're hurting and need his support. I reccomend talking with him about it.", "NTA but with that said, you're working your way towards becoming a serious asshole.  Regardless of your intent, your stepmom will see this as an attack on her.  Additionally, your siblings will someday come to judge you for your actions now.\n\nYour dad clearly was not happy in his marriage to your mother.  Someday you might wind up in a bad relationship too, and then you'll realize why he acted the way he did.  I wouldn't wreck your relationship with him just because you may not have been seeing the full picture of what your parents' marriage was like.", "NAH", "Good for you. I would do the same. I'm not going to give a judgement because in the grand scheme of life your dad is a massive A H and has what's coming to him.", "YTA to yourself. This isn't really going to have an effect on anyone but you. I'm very sorry about your mother, and I'm sorry that your father is being a better husband to his current wife than he was to your mother. But holding on to a grudge isn't going to change anything.", "YTA- in a you need some help to work through your grief kinda way.\n\nPeople change\u2026 losing your Mum had a massive impact on you, it probably did on your Dad too.\n\nI\u2019m guessing other things have changed for your Dad, he may have more money now, less anxiety, little kids are older now etc.  so holidays seem like more of a \u2018good\u2019 idea. \n\nJust talk to your Dad he might know what\u2019s changed for him\u2026 he might not have thought about it consciously.  It definitely wouldn\u2019t be as an \u2018F U\u2019 to your Mum though.\n\nYou\u2019re a kid looking at your parents relationship\u2026 you don\u2019t know what was going on for them at the time.  They might have been struggling to do \u2018anything\u2019 together without tension\u2026 they weren\u2019t doing it because they were trying to make each other miserable\u2026 they were just struggling. \n\nYou are not anything resembling an arsehole for missing your Mum and wishing she could be around for a million lovely happy holidays.  You\u2019re allowed to struggle with the feelings and be sad\u2026 but don\u2019t have to punish yourself or other people for the sadness.  Don\u2019t let it turn in to anger and ruin your good times.", "No , taking fun from my family isn\u2019t going to make me happy I am just upset because my mom never got any of the fun we are getting. I am just upset and probably still grieving but I understand your point", "He didn\u2019t like your mom. He likes this new lady. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re upset, but there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. All you can do is wait a long, long time before you get married, and make sure you really, really like the dude.", "Soft YTA because you already know you're being petty.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that your dad may have realized that he was wasting his life by not joining in on these things and he wants to start living now. Sometimes we don't see things until it's too late. We can't go back and fix our past mistakes, but we can change the way we live going forward.", "Suit yourself. Maybe he learned something, maybe not. Do whatever you wish.", "YTA - more like You are being childish but that's not really an acronym that can be used. \n\n\nYou are being pretty childish and kind of petty, either you mother and father actually did not like each other or your father realized that he made a massive mistake not taking more joy in life while he still had your mother and doesn't want to keep making that mistake. \n\n\nYou pouting will not change the past. All it will do is make sure you are driving a wedge between yourself and the rest of your family. \n\n\nWhat exactly do you want here? Do you want no one to ever have fun or go on trips again? \n\nWould that make you happy?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People change when they experience loss, and he may value things like family time differently because of the trauma of loss. You need to talk to him. You're sacrificing what could be valuable time with him that could leave you with regrets later. I'm saying this as someone who let pettiness come between me and my dad.

They're asking if he married someone way younger. Also, I don't blame you for feeling this way at all. Maybe try to have a heart to heart with him.
