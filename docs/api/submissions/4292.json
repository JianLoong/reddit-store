If he doesn\u2019t like that I might be like my mom, why does he buy me things so that I look like her?

Also, when two parents are working, there tends to be more ordering out of food, more employing people to do cleaning and yard work and such, less bargain hunting and saving on grocery shopping, and so forth.
