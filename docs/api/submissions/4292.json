{"id": 4292, "submission_id": "zgixz8", "title": "AITA? My fianc\u00e9 thinks I should be happy with any present he gets me- even if I tell him specifically what to get or not.", "selftext": "My (42f) fianc\u00e9 (45m) and I have been together for 8 years. For the past several Christmases we end up arguing about the gifts he\u2019s got for me. And I end up not getting him the right things either. So to try to avoid that this year I brought up making lists for each other. He seemed ok with that until I said what I Don\u2019t want him to get me- specifically anything purple or any scarves, that was it. He got mad & said I should be grateful for whatever I get & that since I\u2019m \u201cpoor\u201d (I\u2019m a sahm with very little income) that I should just be happy to get anything at all. He says I\u2019m spoiled for saying anything & that I ruin Christmas every year. Basically he thinks he can get me whatever, including a purple scarf & I should just be happy & say thank you & wear it. AITA for saying what I do or don\u2019t want as gifts for Christmas & telling him to not get me anything if he can\u2019t abide by my wishes?\n\nEdit to add: I don\u2019t hate purple, and sometimes I wear purple, though it\u2019s rare that I buy anything on purpose (I sometimes get hand-me-downs or buy bags of 2nd hand clothes in my size/style.) The main reason I don\u2019t want purple things is bc my mom only wears purple aside from neutrals. Seriously, she is the purple queen. But then when he & I get into arguments over other random things he often says that I\u2019m just like my mom, which I don\u2019t think is true, but that part doesn\u2019t matter. If he doesn\u2019t like that I might be like my mom, why does he buy me things so that I look like her? It\u2019s exhausting just thinking about why. \n\nSorry if this edit changes anyone\u2019s opinion, but I don\u2019t think it will. Although some people might think he has a thing for my mom, but I can\u2019t even imagine that bc she\u2019s almost 70!\n\nEdit #2: Lots of people are saying financial abuse & while he doesn\u2019t usually give me any money, (except this week he gave me $1000 bc he won $10k) he pays all the bills & I just buy groceries & have my own spending money. We do both agree that we\u2019d rather have me home with our kids than to have strangers watching them all the time. I am not the best housekeeper, but I do the majority of it as well as cooking. I was employed at $28/hr for 8 years but was laid off after going back to work part time in 2020 after my mat leave for our first child was over. At the time I had ~$15k in the bank & we own our house together. In the past 2 years my savings has dwindled bc I was still paying ~1k/mo while he was working a lower paid job as an apprentice, but recently he is making more again & his savings has increased by selling his previously owned home & now has $120k more in his bank. So my being \u201cpoor\u201d is not only not true, but it\u2019s due to contributing so much the past few years without much income. (We are in Canada, so no taxes on winnings & we are common law with both names on our house.) \n\nAlso, with the gift-giving, he goes overboard every year & then complains about the money, but also spent a lot on my 12 yr old son for gifts that many of them went unused bc they aren\u2019t his thing either. He also has a bad habit of shopping for himself in December, leaving me scrounging for ideas.", "created_utc": 1670549533, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgixz8/aita_my_fianc\u00e9_thinks_i_should_be_happy_with_any/", "score": 4253, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, when two parents are working, there tends to be more ordering out of food, more employing people to do cleaning and yard work and such, less bargain hunting and saving on grocery shopping, and so forth.

He\u2019s buying *something* to help him maintain the ideal image of himself, and only himself, that he holds in his own mind. \n\nSure, thoughtful gifts are hard.  And after you\u2019ve been together long enough it gets even harder.    But if you don\u2019t at least ATTEMPT to be thoughtful,   it\u2019s not just NOT A GIFT, but it\u2019s something even worse that I can\u2019t find a word for. \n\nStory time:  my MIL (who I adore), once gave me a robe for Christmas.

But that wasn\u2019t the kicker.  My weight had ballooned and it was a subject of shame for me; I weighed over 200 pounds at the time and the robe was\u2026 a medium.    Thank God I didn\u2019t open it in front of her (thanks, COVID, I guess?) because I cried for days; weeks even.  It\u2019s been 2 years and I\u2019m *still* salty.  She\u2019s given me some OK gifts, some good/great gifts, and some \u201cOMFG what did I do to deserve this delight!?!\u201d gifts since then but that one will always sting.   But I accept this as a bump on the road; because I can tell that it was very clearly NOT HER INTENTION. \n\nOn the other hand, my husband and I have been together for a decade, married a few years less.  And just between us, have normalized \u201cit\u2019s ok to return/exchange the gift.\u201d  At some point, we ran out of good gift ideas for each other because we have most of what we NEED and a lot of what we WANT.  When it comes time for gift giving, we try to share a short list of mildly vague wants\u2014 enough to be surprised with whatever turns up but also enough that whatever turns up is CLOSE to what we described.   And sometimes we mutually decide not to exchange anything but to celebrate instead.  Occasionally\u2026 those descriptions aren\u2019t clear or simply misinterpreted.  And we are both comfortable enough to say \u201cthank you; it\u2019s not quite what I was thinking though, I\u2019d rather return or exchange it but I appreciate your intention.\u201d \n\nWhen friends and family discover this, they usually  clutch their pearls and cry \u201cbut\u2026 it was.. a GIFT!?!\u201d  And our response is typically \u201cWell yes, but would you rather keep something you didn\u2019t actually want and quietly resent it every time you used it, or be honest and exchange for the thing that you wanted, that will make you happy every time you use it?\u201d   And adorably, some of those friends and family couples have gone on to embrace the concept. \n\nTo summarize: \n1) it\u2019s not unreasonable to expect a serious or long term partner giving you a gift to give you something you (at the VERY LEAST) need, but preferable want or like. \n2) missing the target on selecting a present or gift for your significant other happens sometimes even if your intentions were clear. \n3) that you should never ever ever ever have to grateful for \u201cgetting anything at all.\u201d \n\nIf nothing else, allow this to be my gift to you:  to know that you are worth more than ANYTHING NOT PURPLE\u2026..

Even if it's something you don't really like, is there a need to fight? The point of making a list is to reduce conflict but why u gotta make it worse but highlighting all the gifts he got wrong in the past lol (I'm assuming he got u a purple scarf once) he obviously wasn't gonna get u a purple scarf again but you're making it sound like he already picked out a purple scarf or smth", "EHS.
