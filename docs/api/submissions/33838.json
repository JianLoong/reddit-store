Our relationship turned toxic as she constantly belittled and undermined me at any chance she got. I'm talking sabotaging my speech at graduation, hiding my keys so I would miss movies, emotional blackmail and so on. It gave me horrendous anxiety that turned into eczema and I decided to distance myself from her, and it's been a relief not to deal with her drama for the past year.\n\nFast forward to the present, and I'm happily engaged to my fianc\u00e9. Recently, I received a message from Emily, expressing excitement about attending my wedding. I was taken aback since we haven't spoken in almost 2 years, and I certainly didn't invite her.\n\nI reached out to my cousin, \"Jake\", who has remained close to Emily, hoping to get some clarity. Jake confirmed that Emily assumed she was invited and was looking forward to being part of the celebration - and that she is family. He suggested I consider letting her attend to avoid drama. I got pissed at him and told him he was out of line.\n\nUnsure of what to do, I decided to call Emily and discuss the situation. She seemed oblivious to our past issues and genuinely believed we were still close. When I explained that our friendship had ended due to her behavior, she became defensive and insisted it was a misunderstanding.\n\nFeeling frustrated, I told her bluntly that I didn't want her at the wedding. She became emotional, pleading with me to reconsider, saying she had changed and deserved a chance. She tried being toxic again by saying that I'm purposely trying to ruin her life and that we're family and that all our family members would be disappointed in me if I excluded her and that's not how family treats each other.  \n\nI, however, stood my ground, citing the toxicity of our past and my desire for a drama-free wedding.\n\nAfter the call, I shared the details with my fianc\u00e9, who fully supported my decision. We decided not to invite Emily, prioritizing our happiness over potential conflicts on our special day.Jake, upset with my choice, claimed I should be more forgiving, especially considering the occasion. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are standing firm, but I'm left wondering if I was too harsh.

Your decision sounds eminently practical and reasonable. Your cousin first says you misunderstood, then that she\u2019s changed. You have seen no evidence of a change, much less an apology for past actions. She obviously wants to be invited to a party. Too bad. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.

Why is her not being invited to a wedding to someone she hasn't spoken to in year \"ruining her life\"?\nThat alone tells me everything I need to know. NTA for not inviting her. NTA if you decide to cut her from your life.  Its YOUR wedding. Its YOU and YOUR WIFE'S day. You both are allowed nothing but happiness and no drama on your day, and if you truly feel that she would dampen that and possibly even ruin it, then you have every right to tell her to kick sand.

Emily has nothing substantial to gain from coming to your wedding except a paid for meal and some relatives, which she can probably get by visiting those relatives herself.

By \"ruining her life\" you are merely holding up a mirror to her actions. Stand strong and maybe alert the wedding party/planner to the situation.", "NTA.

Like sabotage your graduation and intentionally make you miss movies?", "Absolutely, positively NTA!!  \nDo not cave on this. Make sure that there are people on the look out for her, just in case.

The fact that she conveniently remembered her past actions and says that she now has \u2018changed\u2019 doesn\u2019t sound promising", "NTA. In my opinion, Jake and Emily are way out of line. Just because Emily is family and she says she changed doesn't necessarily mean she is automatically allowed to attend the wedding. She treated you terribly, which means she needs to face consequences for her actions, including not being allowed to attend a family wedding. I would say consider uninviting Jake as well since he wants to force you to let a relative who bullied you attend.", "Yes!!! The last line is basically what I used for my wedding. With someone like that, the family knows that she is the way she is already, so just a simple line of wanting to be surrounded by happiness and joy that day served is purpose. I didn't invite my husband's one cousin. I invited her brothers and her parents and a lot like Emily, she tried to force the issue. We stood strong in our decision and I'm so happy we did.  This woman has made half the people in his family cry due to her hurtful and entitled words, including my MIL whom I adore and is the nicest person ever. You don't have to invite people because they're family, it is your wedding... any guests, family friends or other, should be people you want to have there to celebrate. Enjoy your special day!!!", "And she would definitely pull some crap at the Wedding.  Maybe even try to ruin it.  At this point it won't be safe to invite her because OP has pissed her off by confronting her about the past!", "OP, you need to hire security for the doors of your wedding venue. Your cousin Jake or another person is going to get manipulated into bringing Emily as their plus one."]}
