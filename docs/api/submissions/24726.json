And at 13, being unusual or feeling like you have to justify why your circumstances are different is hard. So he's lashing out, because why can't his family just be *normal*. And if he has anything else going on in his life (bullying, struggles with mental health/sexuality/gender/(un)diagnosed neurodivergence/normal fucking puberty) that he doesn't want to talk about, it's easier to focus on this one thing.\n\nShitty teen behaviour? Sure. But teens are gonna teen.

His parents are FRIENDS. I know most kids are raised by toxic ex\u2019s but some of us are actually lucky that our parents can put aside their differences and retain friendship.

He doesn't need to know anything other than they are better friends than partners. I mean for real. I don't know why you think he deserves an explanation.

Its one thing to be friendly with an ex, and co parent respectfully. These 4 people have taken this to another level. As others have said maybe the kid\u2019s friends have made comments. And like I already said maybe he suspects his little brother is biologically his dad\u2019s son. There is alot to be confused about.

It cant get bad easily in those years", "I mean, friends/acquaintances filling his head with the idea that his parents being good friends but just not good spouses for each other is weird, and maybe putting some sexual shit onto it that just isn't there?

I couldn't imagine my mom who is no longer married to my dad but somehow having this weird cross sectional relationship with her and her new husband and my step mom?

As a parent, though, you really dropped the ball on this one. YTA. Your 13 year old son shared his feelings with you. And you dismissed those feelings because you don't like them. I hope you go to him and apologize, discuss his concerns, and validate him. He is directly affected by your relationship with his mom, so it seems reasonable to say it kinda is his business.

He's got just enough grasp of the situation to know he can't just say that - especially if he interacts positively with his stepparents and feels like they're part of his family - so his frustration boils over and he wants the cause of his angst (the hanging out) to end. \n\nSo to him, you've just straight up lied to him. You've told him your relationship with his mother is none of his business, but that doesn't feel real to him because you're talking about something that affects every minute of his life. \n\nTo be honest, while I think you handled this like an AH I don't think you are an AH.

Those would all be things worth hearing out. But the thing that he is complaining about is not a thing that is worth complaining about. He is talking nonsense.\n\nThere is nothing that can or should be done about what he is complaining about. His parents should absolutely not stop being friends.\n\nI am dismissing him and assuming that he's just being a dick, because that's literally the only possible explanation for complaining about what he is complaining about.\n\nIt would literally make more sense if he was complaining about The neighbor's cat being too friendly or something. His complaint is simply nonsense. There is nothing that can or should be done about it.\n\nIf he was 21 or 43, his complaint would be equally as nonsense, but he wouldn't have the excuse of being a teenager at that point.

But he decided it wasn't good enough.", "Bullied for his parents? Dealing with the aftermath of a divorce? Being neglected by his dad because he's too busy grabbing coffee with his ex wife? Once again, it could be any number of things, we'll simply never know because his dad is an immature brat who doesn't know how to talk to his own son. You're jumping to conclusions that make you feel good and conform to your view that the kid is just being a stupid kid. \n\nThere's a big stretch between hearing your kid out to speak to them about why they feel the way they do and letting your kid run your life. Is the dad just so terrible at dealing with kids that the only thing he can say is the parental equivalent of fuck off? Because to me this sounds like a dad who doesn't want to parent that kid at all. \n\n Sorry your mind is so narrow or perhaps congratulations you are so blessed that you cannot understand this kid at all.", "If OP and his ex wife didn't have children, they would still be friends. He's stating a fact. What exactly is wrong with that?", "A child might take that statement as proof that you don't really care that much about them or didn't ever want them.", "How friendship and love works and why its a positive thing to get along like this\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFeelings are complicated and explaining ur own and their feelings to them may help.

This child's only problem is that his parents are friends despite being divorced and you have somehow spun it into the child being unwanted? Because his parents won't give in to his selfish demand that they stop being friends?", "There isn't a complicated relationship?", "Not at all, I explained why you'd have to be an idiot and/or a bad father to say those words to your kid while calling them a brat.", "YTA, your kids is clearly having issues with it and you as his father are supposed to help them. Not act like a moron about it. You said 'not his bidness'. Are you a child yourself to talk like that?\nI feel sorry for your son as he is figuring out what's going on and his own father behaves like that? What a poor relationship that must be, and what a poor child. From what you said, he's not dictating to you at all. He's uncomfortable. So why not try sit him down. You THINK he won't understand. But you clearly know nothing as how you just treated your child.... understand this. He WILL resent you for how you act towards him. And I don't blame him.", "So, um, are you \\*ever\\* going to tell your son he has another sibling?

YTA and I am astonished at your complete lack of ability to help your own child navigate this clearly emotionally complex issue and instead, decide to treat him like some random colleague. You\u2019re an absolute doorknob.", "I'd guess kid has friends with divorced parents. Those kids probably have a very different concept of what is 'normal' for divorced couples and the kid doesn't really understand that he's actually in a far better position having parents who get along despite seperating. Teenagers zone in on the things that make them different. In a few years his opinion will change but he doesn't have the life experience or emorional maturity to see it now. NTA. Harsh maybe, but a life lesson. You can't control other people, even if they embaress you. Plenty of people learn this in much worse ways.", "You have a lot of comments, but on the off chance you read mine, I\u2019d like to share something. \n\nMy parents had a long, drawn out divorce when I was younger. They split and lived in different houses starting when I was three. My mom used to come over to my dads house sometimes, for parties and events. It was fun. But they weren\u2019t together and it was really important for me to have time with the parent that was responsible for me, whoever\u2019s \u201ctime\u201d I was on when it was \u201ctheir time\u201d with me. \n\nWhat mattered most to me then, and now, is knowing about their relationship. I want to know why they got together, why they were together so long, why they made the choices they did, and I want to know why they treated each other how they did. It matters to me because they\u2019re my parents, that\u2019s really all there is to it. \n\nYou\u2019re crowding your child. Your child is dealing, constantly, with two families in all locations they live in. You aren\u2019t letting them experience you and their bio mom as a happy couple raising them and you aren\u2019t letting them experience your family and their moms family separately either. On top of that, they probably want to know why you two split up at all if you\u2019re this friendly, couldn\u2019t you have made it work, etc.? Your child has told you that it makes them uncomfortable to always (or at least enough that it makes them feel uncomfortable) be around everyone. And instead of listening to that discomfort, you told them to shut up and go away, it\u2019s not their business. And I disagree, I think it is. As someone who wants, so much, to know about what went on between my parents that I cling to scraps of stories and beg for even the tiniest bits of information, I think your child should be allowed to know about your relationship with their mom. And I think it\u2019s cruel to withhold that information, unless it involves abusive behaviors which it doesn\u2019t seem to. \n\nOn the other hand, if you guys are all fucking, stop fucking with your kid\u2019s head and be real with them at least about something if not about that. Children are curious (especially about family matters and especially in non-nuclear families), telling them shut up is just mean, all you\u2019re doing is working toward ending/ruining/breaking your relationship with your child.\n\nYTA - for telling your kid it\u2019s not his business", "YTA. Your poor son feels uncomfortable at this dynamic but instead of discussing it with him and making him feel reassured, you shut him down and make yourself look significantly more suspicious and weird.", "YTA. How could you imagine that the relationship between a child's parents is none of his business? It isn't up to him to dictate what that relationship is but you owe him a discussion and to respect his feelings.", "> but I'm not apologizing to a brat who is dictating who I can or can't be friends with.\n\nThis is the response of someone who lacks maturity. \n\nBe a parent and explain to your kid how you and ex are friends and that he's lucky that you get along so well.", "This. Is. Such. A. Weird. Family. Dynamic. I would be weirded out as your son too. Tf!", "NTA **BUT**... be **kind** to your 13 year old and research teenage boy brains for his age. His crabbiness is normal and you should navigate your communication with him with a loving heart, not scorn.", "YTA. It is absolutely his business. And the way you talk about your son is appaling. Be a better parent or find out how it is if your child won't speak to you as an adult. \n\nAnd it's great that you and your Ex get along well. But you might not want to hear: Being a sperm donor for your Ex IS super weird.", "Obviously, YTA. You're acting like this is some random person objecting to a random friendship you have. The relationship you have with your ex is the kid's business because you are his parents. And if you were a better parent you'd realize that his emotional processing of this and general well being is your business and should in fact be your top priority in this situation. Calling your own child names because they are experiencing discomfort at this unusual situation further points to you nor relating to him, at least in this context, like a father is supposed to relate to a son. I hope this is an exception to how you generally are with him.", "Bidness?? YTA - listen and help your kids and don\u2019t be so selfish for once", "You are one stupid man YTA I don't even know where to begin and I don't want to waste time explaining why you are so dumb, so I'm.not even gonna bother since it will go in one ear and out the other, so I'm just gonna say YTA.", "Nothing justifies you snapping back at a 13yo as if he was a nosy adult colleague and not your own child dealing with the fact his family has a unique dynamic he's now old enough to try and understand.

Do you even like this kid", "YTA\n\nIs it fine for you to be so close with your ex. Yes! That's wonderful! However, it's perfectly understandable for your son to have complex feelings about it. A lot of young people have strong but irrational feelings e.g. children who have a parent that has died often feel angry at the parent for abandoning them and continue to feel that way into their teens.\n\nHe probably just needs you to talk things through with him calmly and help him work through his feelings. If you don't think you'd be able to deal with that, then therapy is probably the best option (it's probably something he could do with anyway, but I don't know if that's free or accessible for young people where you live).", "NTA.

You know teenagers make everything about sex because they just learned about it! Lol", "Just a half sibling by law. Biologically it's a full on sibling. Which tbh makes it even weirder. They really couldn't find another donor?", "Bunch of other 13-year-olds whose parents hate each other and don't know no other way of life", "And op needs to learn that to get respect he must also give respect, treating your child like that will cause them to hate you as they get older, there is calmer ways op could have responded", "Yep nowadays the children have the same rights as the parents ridiculous.

If I understand you correctly, you\u2019re saying even an *adult* child doesn\u2019t have the right to know they have a half sibling?", "Wtf is going on is that his divorced parents are friends. Like if he can't accept that he's a brat. \nAnd by the way, you do not owe anyone, including your kids, an explanation for being friends with someone. Including your ex.", "No, he doesn't because based on the op his life isn't being negatively affected in anyway. His parents sound like they have a perfectly healthy co-parenting relationship. If the son is curious and asks questions, that's one thing. But the idea that he's owed any explanations or he has the right to dictate anything that's going on is laughable at best. He needs to stay in a child's place.", "Because he's still young and has only just started puberty which can already be confusing enough, being disrespectful back just teaches him it's ok to be rude", "Don't ever have children.", "THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A HALF SIBLING.\n\nThey don\u2019t know he\u2019s a *full* sibling.\n\nWhich is **irrelevant.**\n\nAnd NO, that is a private medical procedure involving his mom and his stepfather he is NOT entitled all the gory details.

Better hope they never do a 23 and me then huh?", "Which is why it\u2019s better to have the conversation ahead of time. But NO, it is NOT an entitlement.

Nobody has asked the child what is wrong or what he's struggling with, they've just told him to butt out.
