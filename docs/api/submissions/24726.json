I would try to figure it out by talking and have him understand the benefits of this. \n\nIf you just shut him out he could become closed off or afraid to come and talk with you about issues.

Or did you just say it's none of his business?", "You\u2019re really obtuse to think a 13 year old gets the nuance of that, especially when you\u2019re all enmeshed. It\u2019s odd and confusing and it\u2019s your job to help him understand it. Not to call him a brat online and expect him to figure it it.

That you love his mom but realized you were better off as friends?", "Ok sure, but we are not the ones you should be telling.

He is a child.", "Yeah but kids don\u2019t understand that stuff. They don\u2019t know shit about romantic love. That\u2019s one of those things you can\u2019t figure out until you actually experience it.", "Okay OP.", "You're mindset is that he's a brat for asking valid questions. It's more just shocking you don't get how your divorce and then rekindling the friendship with his mom has even the potential to fuck him up. I bet he's as tall as you. Even though he looks like an adult he's a kid.", "He's asking questions because he's trying to understand how the world works and why his family dynamic is *so*  different from everyone he knows. \n\n...while you're throwing a temper tantrum ranting about \"*ReSPecT*\" \n\nWhich one is more childish?", "Could have fooled me.", "And you\u2019re the asshole", "You\u2019re an asshole, treat your kids better", "What are you, fifteen? No, he does not deserve an explanation. If he caught his  divorced parents in bed or something, then, OK. But if they're just hanging out as friends, he doesn't deserve an \"explanation.\" Because he's been given it: they're friends. He just refuses to believe it's true. As do you, for some reason.

There is no indication that OP and his ex would get back together, their respective spouses would be indication of that. \nThe 13 year old is not being abused, ignored, blackmailed, parentifiend, brainwashed or anything else that occurs within toxic divorces. \nHe's just a brat, looking for a reason to play victim.", "How does that make him a shitty parent?", "And he has a 10 year old who loves the situation- should he say fu to that kid as well? \n\nDid you miss the part where op asks son what was wrong?  \u201cIt\u2019s weird and just had to stop\u201dis not exactly the level setting reasoning to understand we may not have been seeing things clearly.", "[deleted]", "Donation at a clinic doesn\u2019t involve sex."]}
