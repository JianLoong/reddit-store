You are wrong as well as YTA.", "Well you're acting like a little kid, so don't be surprised if we're harsh with you.\n\n\nYou dipshit.", "I don't even consider my 7 year old a little kid. Your 13 year old is certainly not a little kid.", "No, you don't", "Sometimes you need to be a good parent too. YTA.", "13 isn't the age to treat them like little kids, instead you should treat them more and more like adults and help them grow up as a perosn, even if it involves exploring and helping with different feelings that might not make sense to you.", "Ok seriously? I was leaning to siding with you as NTA until this crack. 13 is hardly a little kid. Does he get to dictate your relationships, no. But you sir need a lesson in being a proper father. I think you and your ex both need to have a chat with him in a civil and \"adult\" setting. Kids are incredibly intuitive to parental bullshit. Don't make this worse.", "Seriously what is your problem", "By the end of the post I was 99% positive it was bullshit. Here's the other 1%.", "He is not a little kid\u2026 and it isn\u2019t just your relationship, it\u2019s also his.. How do you think he feels knowing his full brother is being technially stepdad. Your relationship is strange and I don\u2019t understand stepmom being ok with everything. Your son knows how strange this whole thing is.. he isn\u2019t blind or dumb.. \n\nYTA .. heck you give your child to ex and her husband but tell son this relationship is non of his business and call him a brat.. instead of trying to discuss why he thinks it\u2019s weird you go on the defensive..", "Nah. That\u2019s just being an asshole to a kid when they\u2019re learning how to deal with their thoughts and emotions. \n\nYour kid\u2019s response to you asking ironically matches your response to them. So ya you\u2019re not just an asshole, you\u2019re a shittier kind of asshole, one who bullies their own kids because they felt dumb by what their kids said and didn\u2019t have anything better to respond with. \n\nBut the plus side of things - good on you for maintaining a healthy friendship with your ex I guess. Too bad you\u2019re not putting in as much effort into the relationships you have with your kids. \n\nMost adults are the ones who need to grow up, but most of us haven\u2019t figured that out yet because our parents did the same shit you did. I feel bad for your kid tbh.", "he\u2019s a teenager and also a human being. i can see why he may not want to be spending so much time with you, my guy\u2026YTA", "A perfect example of someone who doesn\u2019t realize that barring them dying super young, the majority of their relationship with their children will take place when the children are adults. Treat them with respect now or they\u2019ll remember it later. Childhood lasts a minute, but what you do during this time lasts a lifetime", "You\u2019re just being an asshole to your son, dude. You suck. When is it okay to tell your kids who are struggling through a transitional period that they have no say in how their life is structured? They\u2019re kids. They\u2019re unwitting passengers to the lives their parents live until they can move out. Is this how you want to be with your child, locking him into a situation he isn\u2019t uncomfortable with?\n\nAnd I fucking HATE the way you talked about him in your last sentence. He\u2019s not just \u201csome brat\u201d, he\u2019s your FUCKING SON. He deserves respect, you dick.\n\nYTA", "Have fun not talking/having a relationship with your kid after they 18 and cut contact", "You really are an AH. Your son is becoming a teenager, and has pretty reasonable questions and feeling about your dynamic with his mother. Have a fucking heart.\n\nAnd no, this would not be an appropriate time to be harsh even if your son was younger", "You were so close to not being an AH yet here we are. Shit father who can't admit when he's wrong. You need to grow emotionally if you care about all the kids you have", "idk, why don't you bother TALKING to him about it and actually try parenting your kid instead of calling him a brat online.", "Maybe he doesn\u2019t understand why his parents ended their marriage if they\u2019re still so close that they spend so much of their free time together and even have another child together. He might feel you and his mother shouldn\u2019t have put him and his sibling through the transition of a divorce and remarriage if you planned to stay best friends.", "How is it hurting him is a different question.", "He\u2019s seeing a relationship that he doesn\u2019t understand. Teens have a way of judging things in terms of black and white sometimes and your relationship with your ex (although fantastic and something I hope all divorced couples achieve) is \u201cnot normal\u201d to him. Yes, he said it in a shitty and disrespectful way. The thing is, after you\u2019ve said it\u2019s not his business, also sit him down and explain that in the long run, it is better for everyone in the family that you two get along. It might not look like his friends\u2019 divorced parents, it might not look like media portrayals of split up couples, but it is normal for you. Of course you will get pushback but hopefully something you\u2019ve said will resonate with him and stay with him for the rest of his life.", "My favorite thing in AITA is when people ask for advice and argue through the whole thread.\n\nYTA buddy, just ask around", "Ultimately, YTA.  Learn to be more patient and find better ways to to talk to your son to understand his concerns and better ways to explain things to your son.\n\nHe's young and impressionable, and I'm guessing his friends and classmates have commented on the relationship, and explained how that's not normal (he might have even been teased for it, or have classmates comment that you and your ex are still together and he's too stupid to understand that, etc.).  But this is all pure conjecture, because rather than have a simple conversation with your son you went into AH mode. \n\nAlso, keep in mind that what you have described is pretty unusual for how exes interact, even those who have relatively amicable divorces.  This is probably creating a lot of confusion, doubts, and anxiety for him, by trying to understand to complexities and nuances of adult relationships at 13.   \n\nInstead of insulting your son by calling him a brat and claiming that he is disrespecting you, you should take the time to explain the nature of yours and your ex's relationship, and how having a good relationship helps you both to be better parents to him and his brother.  It also usually helps to explain why you and your ex didn't work romantically/married, but work as a friendship.", "Why don\u2019t you ask him - modeling a healthy example of open emotional communication, instead of being an asshole because you\u2019re too lazy to have challenging conversations with your children.", "Ask him genius", ">I won't be disrespected\n\nYou're a tool", ">I won't be disrespected\n\naaand this is why you're TA", "You asked him what was wrong. He said the situation was weird. How is that disrespecting you?", "How is he disrespecting you?", "No, your respect still needs to be earned.

The one who doesn\u2019t actually take the time to speak to his kid because to you they\u2019re property not people. Good luck with that when your kid becomes a hateful teen who won\u2019t tell you anything.", "Dont have any more kids please, we dont need more of you around. YTA", "Can\u2019t wait for your kid to be posting here in few years talking about how he\u2019s no contact with his dad and his dad just can\u2019t understand why.\n\nYTA.", "Defensive much? He didn\u2019t disrespect you, he told you the situation was weird. And it fucking is.", "This just in: disagreeing with OP is disrespecting. Of course people are going to be disrespectful towards you if you have this attitude, most people don't like shitty AHs.", "First marriage kids were 4 and 7 at divorce, about 10 and 13\n\nNew kid is 4, biologically OP's but raised as Ex and her second husband's child. Unclear how OP \"assisted\" with that.", "That pooor boy. I cant stand it my parents get along. Oh please. Did OP handle that the best, no.  But damn.  He is a 13 year old. Yeah the circumstances seem a little odd but The kid needs to deal. Are his feelings irrelevant? No. But teaching our kids to deal with not getting their way and being in a perfect bubble is also important", "Heck if I was his teenage child first thing I would want explained is how he gave his child to stepdad.. this relationship is strange to say the least.", "Guess because son doesn\u2019t agree with him. Poor child should have any thoughts of his own.. mom didn\u2019t step in so she isn\u2019t mother of year either..", "I doubt he deposited into a tube on that assist lol", "The part you missed was that he didn\u2019t teach his son how to deal with it, he just told him to deal with it.  The kid can have his feelings, be validated for having them, and still not get his way.  It\u2019s the invalidation that\u2019s not right and that\u2019s what OP did.", "He\u2019s not teaching his kid shit, that\u2019s the problem and what makes him YTA.\n\nA kid needs to LEARN how to deal with his feelings. Telling him to just suck it up isn\u2019t teaching him that. Probe into WHY he feels it\u2019s weird. Is he being bullied? Are there rumors about his parents? What suddenly makes it odd? Because most 13 year olds aren\u2019t going to find their separated parents behaving as friends as \u201cweird\u201d. So either OPs relationship with mom and spouse is A LOT \u201cfriendlier\u201d than \u201cjust close friends\u201d or there is something going on that\u2019s causing him to feel this way.\n\nHelping your kids learn how to navigate their feelings is called parenting. I get that a lot of people suck at it because their own parents sucked at it, but the goal isn\u2019t to raise yet another generation who needs therapy to recover from their childhood.", "The only thing OP taught his son is that his father doesn't care about him.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the 13 year old has a friend or more than one friend whose parents are divorcing now or have divorced and is telling him it\u2019s weird that his parents and their new spouses get along so well, and kids that age hate to be different in any way.\n\nOr that he sees you getting along so well and wonders why you and his mom divorced in the first place.\n\nDoes he know the four yr old is biologically yours? He might think you cheated on current wife with ex wife and that whole mess is going to explode soon.\n\nNo telling what he\u2019s thinking, and you didn\u2019t even ask."]}
