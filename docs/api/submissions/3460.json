Don't lie and pretend you won't say anything when you were planning on saying something. Your bf should leave you.", "YTA, you were told by someone you (presumably) love and respect to keep a secret and just caused trouble. This was family business, none of your business to get involved.", "YTA. It was not your secret to share. Also your friend shouldn\u2019t be betting on a family member dying to sort out her finances. Inheritance is a privilege not a right. She lost the privilege. Tough luck. \n\nIf I was your boyfriend I would dump your ass because clearly you can\u2019t be trusted.", "Info: why is the grandfather doing that?\n\nBut with the current info YTA, boyfriend told you not to tell anyone and likely wouldn't have even told you had you not been next to him while he was on the phone.", "NTA You should edit your post to let everyone know that gramps also promised his estate to your friend.\n\nI have a feeling that grandpa has been saying this to everyone in the family to manipulate them. Who knows what the will *actually* says.  \n\nI don\u2019t think that you are TA for letting your friend know that she was being manipulated. She probably let the family know because she had her grandpa sussed out.\n\nToo bad for gramps that he has to deal with the fall out now instead of avoiding it like he planned. He deserves to be called out for his poor behaviour.", "YTA, you had access to privileged information due to your relationship, you betrayed your boyfriends trust, gave information you had no business discussing to a friend, albeit the sister. You put an elderly man in a position where his dying wishes are now subject to argument with the family. You created division in a family not your own and potentially destroyed your bf\u2019s relationship with his sister. The word does not yet exist to describe how big an AH you are. Your poor bf", "With the grandfather promising your friend something I feel she had a right to know that she'd no longer be getting that so that she wouldn't be blindsided and could plan accordingly. From your comment it sounds like she was promised something financially significant. \n\nIdk if you're an AH for telling her tbh but I do think you made a mess of things when you could've just had your boyfriend tell his sister instead. \"Yet\" is very much a vague time frame and the sister deserves to be told so that she could get her ducks in a row as soon as possible. If \"yet\" meant next week, next month or next year then yeah I would've probably been mum about it if she had nothing significant financially happen during that time. If \"yet\" means \"on my deathbed\" then absolutely not the AH. \n\nThe grandfather also comes off as a bit manipulative with him threatening to remove your BF from the inheritance if he doesn't break up with you and the promising x the sister and not telling her he changed his mind (if he ever planned to actually follow through at all).", "NTA. The only \"disappointment\" is the grandfather, who is a manipulative dick.\n\nBF hiding the news from his own sister that she's being secretly disinherited - presumably bc 'hey great more money for me' - is also a dick move. But ultimately this dynamic was set up by the grandfather who is now acting true to form by using his money to make demands about his grandson's relationship. Seriously, demanding your bf break up with you or he'll be disinherited is a very dick move.\n\nTo Be Clear: grandfather is free to leave his money to whomever he wants, but it is not okay for him to lie to people about their inheritance and to use the prospect of inheritance to manipulate his offspring's private lives.\n\nTelling the granddaughter not to worry about money bc she'll get inheritance and then secretly disinheriting her (presumably to accentuate the shock and hurt of finding out the truth only after he's died) is a very dick move. Grandfather also knows he is pitting his grandchildren and other offspring against each other, basically making them fight each other for his amusement or gratification. Gross.\n\nOP you were put in an impossible position where you had to betray either your friend - who was being lied to and was making life decisions based on false info - or your boyfriend, who wasn't acting honorably himself. There was no winning choice for you.\n\nActually, kudos to you for acting against your own self interest here. I mean, you could have figured, 'screw my friend, I'll keep my mouth shut and marry BF and then I'll get 50% of the money' but instead you told her vital information she needs to plan her life. You're a good friend. I'm sorry this sucky thing happened.", "Eh I\u2019ll go ESH also I would have told my best friend as well. While knowing that it\u2019s an AH thing to do.", "Going against the grain here but NTA, yes grandpa can do what he wants with his money, he's free to leave everyone with nothing but his favorite grandchild, but he is not free from the consequences of it, people need to know and if he is too much of a coward to tell them good on you", "Now very likely if your BF stays with you, he will also be disinherited.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and maybe get downvoted for this but **NTA for telling** (at least in my opinion). \n\nAnalogy: a man cheats on his wife, his best friend finds out he cheated and tells the wife; the wife divorces the husband because of it: who\u2019s fault it is? Is the divorce the best friends fault for telling the wife or is it the husbands fault for cheating in the first place? **correct answer is that it\u2019s the husbands fault for cheating in the first place** \n\nGrandpa wants to blame you, but ultimately he was the one who made the decision and he gets to deal with the turmoil of his decision; it doesn\u2019t matter how the family found out it\u2019s the fact that this decision happened in the first place.\n\nHowever, you may also get to deal with the turmoil of your actions as well; you may get dumped because you opened up what was supposed to be confidential information. Your bf probably won\u2019t trust you with information like this ever again and will likely be distant with you for all phone-calls going forward.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have shared the information, but I understand why you did. I would as well.\n\nYour bf is an AH, for being okay with this plan and hiding it.\n\nYour bf's Grandpa is the AH for promising his children/grandchildren one thing then sneakily doing something else.\n\nYour friend, well she is completely innocent in this, and it sucks to be her in this situation.", "I'm gonna say ESH. You were put in a tricky spot to choose between keeping a secret your bf asked you to and telling your best friend (and by doing so you prevented her from making any financial decisions that were influenced by her grandfather's promise to her). Your intentions were honest but I think it would've been better to tell your bf to talk to his sister about it instead of him making you keep a secret, or at least informing him that he shouldn't tell you things about it if he expects you to keep it a secret. It sounds like you agreed to keep it a secret and then just changed your mind without letting him know, which would be an AH move. He now has to work on repairing a relationship with his sister that maybe wouldn't have been affected if he had spoken to her first.\n\nI can't judge or agree with people saying your bf should break up with you over this jfc. No one knows how long you've been friends with the sister vs. dating your bf also but I think you have to think about who you are putting first moving forward, because in this situation it sounds like you were trying to be a good friend more than a loyal gf which is your prerogative but just know there will be consequences in this case with his family. Maybe after all the fighting the rest of his family (sans grandfather) will be grateful this came to light.", "Considering the clarification in the comments, NTA.\n\nReconsider the bf in general if he truly wasn't planning on telling her. He was gonna go around and let her think this was coming then pull the rug from under her. She can actually plan ahead without fake promises from her grandfather now- she knows better than to believe him. Hope BF gets that message, too, cause he's next for whatever slight his grandfather imagines\n\nAlso, this family sounds like a nightmare in general, so maybe run", "YTA. Your partner told you something he didn't want anyone else to know and you blabbed. You broke a trust. To me that's a deal breaker.", "I'm going NTA here. The real AH is grandpa. He is making a decision that goes back on promises made to your best friend and likely to other family members. Grandpa then asked your boyfriend to not share with the rest of the family that he intends to break those promises and bribed him with his entire belongings when he dies. I'll agree with the Y T As that you were the spark, but Grandpa dosed everyone in gasoline.", "Of course YTA it was not your conversation to begin with. You were point blank asked not to discuss it. You knew it would cause issues to share it and chose to anyhow. You broke your boyfriend's trust in a massive way and started massive drama with his entire family.", "Honestly? Grandpa is the AH. I understand it\u2019s his money but giving it only to one person? That pretty messed up. If I were his sister I would have gone to grandpa and without giving it away, I would have mentioned something to get at least some of the money.", "OP you are a good friend and not an asshole. Any one of these fucking people saying otherwise would\u2019ve been grateful to you had you done the same for them and prevented them from being completely blindsided when the grandpa passed away.  It\u2019s of course his choice what to do with his will, but he is the only asshole here for trying to change it secretly without letting people that expected to be part of it know so he doesn\u2019t have to defend what is probably his bullshit.\n\nIn fact, tremendous props to you because you most likely stood to gain personally by keeping your mouth shut and you didn\u2019t", "YTA. This had nothing to do with you.", "YTA big time.  He shouldn\u2019t trust you again.  Run like the wind dude.", "ESH.  Your bf is a blabbermouth. You're a blabbermouth. Your friend is a blabbermouth. And your grandfather is a secret keeper and a drama llama. You all deserve each other.", "Idk if Y T A, but that dude will leave you if his grandfather asks in order to keep the money. I would side with your friend.", "NTA Grandpa sounds like grown up bully from your comment.", "YTA\n\nThis wasn't your knowledge to know. It wasn't your knowledge to tell. Telling would do nothing to change the outcome but bring pain and hate into a family situation. If you wanted to help your best friend you should have talked with your boyfriend about passing on enough to ensure she had enough to help her out moving forward.\n\nHe will probably leave you over this. A betrayal of trust of this scale is neigh impossible to repair.", "YTA. \n\nHe said not to tell anyone. You justified an exception in your mind and did it anyway. \n\nI\u2019d leave you over this. You can\u2019t be trusted to keep things in confidence. Trust is a vital component of a relationship, and lack of trust is a dealbreaker. \n\nYou screwed up, badly. Learn the lesson.", "YTA You can tell your best friend everything that's *about you*. This wasn't your story to tell.", "YTA - You overheard a conversation and your boyfriend told you that in confidence. It was not your business to pass rumors. Also, nobody should rely on inheritance because it's not yours until it's given to you. Based on the family dynamics, your BF seems like he will have a nice legal battle ahead of him as his family argues amongst themselves. Seems kind of sick that everyone is bickering over his money before he's even dead and buried.", "YTA - \"I don't keep secrets from her\" lol what are you like 12 or something? This has literally nothing to do with you. Stay out of it.", "YTA. At first I was thinking that maybe the grandfather wanting his son to break up with you was overreacting (though that would not have absolved of your YTA status, for the record), but after more thought I can see where he\u2019s coming from. Just because he \u201cknows you always tell your best friend everything\u201d doesn\u2019t mean you have permission to tell her everything. You need to actually stop and think if maybe there\u2019s some things you shouldn\u2019t stick your nose into and get involved with. This was never your information to share, and I think it\u2019d be fair if your boyfriend is now second guessing if he can trust you with any information at all, considering that you pretty much just proved you will always choose his sister over him and tell her everything. This information was never yours to share, regardless of what affect it has on your friend. It was the grandfather\u2019s to share when the time was right. \n\nAlso, kinda gross that your friend is \u201crelying\u201d on money she assumed she would get from her grandfather. Planning how to spend his money once he\u2019s dead is not a good sign, to me, in most cases and he probably has a really good reason for disinheriting literally everyone but your boyfriend.", "So, you now have an ex-boyfriend and probably an ex-friend.\n\nGrandpa is allowed to do whatever the hell he wants with his money.  The fact that the grand children are already spending it before he passed speaks volumes about them being greedy jerks.\n\nWhat happens if grandpa was saying all this as a test? \n\n\nYTA and you know it.", "ESH. your bf knowing that you tell everything to the sister shouldn\u2019t have told you. You shouldn\u2019t have told the sister. The sister shouldn\u2019t have told everyone else. The grandfather is shitty for keeping it a secret. I mean it is his money why does he have to be answerable to anyone but then hide it from his family members?? What is up w everyone here", "Lol Reddit is unhinged. \u2018Stay out of other people\u2019s business.\u2019 Like 1) your BEST FRIEND is a stranger and 2) like this pair of misogynists deserved your loyalty. \n\nSorry that people who\u2019d walk past someone getting murdered (cos that\u2019s no one else\u2019s business, is it?) are voting you an asshole, but this is why you don\u2019t date your friends\u2019 siblings \u2014 although to be fair, most don\u2019t create as easily solvable conflicts of interest as this one. \n\nLeave him, he\u2019s a selfish, sexist, deceitful liar. NTA", "YTA\n\nYou deliberately inserted yourself in your boyfriend's family dynamics even though you were asked not to. Your loyalty and respect should be towards your partner. You've now proven to him that no matter what he asks you, you will not hold it in confidence but instead include his sister and therefore his whole family. \n\nTBH He should leave you, he should not be with someone he can't trust.", "YTA - you knew the drama that this would cause and yet you dove head first into it.", "Bigtime YTA. It was not your business or your place.", "YTA none of this concerns you.", "YTA - You should never share something told to you in confidence, especially when it would start drama. You should have told your bf that you couldn't keep a secret before telling his sister. He shouldn't have told you, but you broke his trust and may have made things harder for the whole family. \n\nReceomnadation: You need to apologize to your Bf and his grandfather.", "YTA\u2026 it was not yours to share. it\u2019s that simple.", "YTA\n\nNever rely on someone dying before you for your financial security.\n\nAlso your friend is an A.\n\nNot your family.

This was not your business or your place to interfere.", "While it's nice to think about what you might do if you get money in an inheritance some day, planning what you WILL do with it is just yuck.

Congratulations, you likely just fucked it all up for both of them. How are you to know that your boyfriend couldn't be convinced to be more generous after things pass to his hands? Your ability to infer possible outcomes from given data is not up to par.", "YTA wasn't your story to tell. The brother should have done it but also the sister shouldn't be counting on money until she literally sees it in her hands.", "yikes. YTA and a huge troublemaker. dont get involved in family business. you should have offered your advice to the by telling the BF to tell the sister etc.", "He should have asked you if you can keep a secret before telling you. Has he told you secrets before? Did he ask this time?\n\nJust think of this as a lesson to never tell anyone ever anything that only you should know. Hopefully he learned this lesson also.\n\nEdited to add: NTA He shouldn't have repeated his Grandfather's secret to anyone, including you.", "YTA - You infuriate the ever living tarantulas out of me. Not only did you decide to put your meddlesome nose where it didn't belong, but you also decided that it was your part to share that info with the rest of the family. Mind you, a family you are NOT a part of. Knight in Shining armor right here. The Grandfather has every right to blame you and not want you to be dating his Grandson, just off the basis of how untrustworthy you are. On top of that you also violated the trust between you and your boyfriend. Man you are such a Shipwreck.", "YTA he asked you not to share this information. It sounds like you might not have the full story and people get weird about inheritance. Personally I think it\u2019s sick and don\u2019t spend time with/love my family members based off of what I might inherit nor do I live a life dependent on the idea. You started a poopot of drama over something that wasn\u2019t your business.", "YTA. I would've kicked your ass to the curb.", "&#x200B;\n\n1. You only found out this privileged information, because your ear was much too close to the phone.  This information was not for your ears, in the first place.\n2. Your boyfriend asked you not to blab.  You blabbed.\n\nYou shared info with bf's sister that was not yours to share, against your bf's wishes.  You would have done better to advise her to seek other sources of money, than rely on an inheritance.  You didn't go that route.  You didn't let your bf deal with this.  Now you've stirred up a shitstorm, and you're reaping the rewards.  Congratulations.\n\nYTA", "YTA...\"We don't keep secrets between us\" isn't carte blanc to break someone else's trust. It's also why you're boyfriend will resist telling you anything important in the future.", "Yes, YTA. It's not your family and not your place to play a role in this drama.", "YTA. You should have told him then that if it blows up later and sister asks if you knew he had to go along with the story that you never knew about anything", "yta. when did it become your issue in regards to their families' inheritance? you had no business involving yourself nor was it your responsibility to say anything. you should have respected her grandfather's wishes. it has nothing to do with you, why meddle?", "YTA.. it wasn\u2019t your place to interfere with their family dynamic.\nClearly the grandpa made that choice for a reason and it wasn\u2019t your job to tell anyone.", "Info: did grandpa ring everyone and only bf answered straight away. So grandpa decided to leave it all to him because of it. Does the sister actually have a relationship with grandpa or is it one sided. \n\nInheritance can be a ugly affair. When it was realised my grandmother wasn\u2019t gonna last long, my mum was already planning what to do with her money. Two days after my grandmothers funeral her children went through her house and took what they wanted. My mum and aunt fought over a handbag. And my mum cried because my Aunty took it. It was given back to her and she tantrumed going on how she doesn\u2019t want it anymore", "NTA", "This sucks. I get where you're coming from, but I also wouldn't blame him for leaving you.", "NTA. Yeah maybe you shouldn't have said something but it's quiet understandable you did. Honestly the grandpa seems to be a real dick, he knows the sister needs money and even told her she will get some and than he goes behind her back to change it. And the boyfriend didn't seemed to have wanted to share that money. He values money over family. You choose family, they choose money. Probably for the best if you get rid of him as soon as possible. And help out the sister.", "This is something that seriously affects your best friend\u2019s long-term plans; you just saved her a lot of agony in the future, so I think you\u2019re NTA. You\u2019re only obliged to keep secrets as long as they\u2019re harmless. This secret was a bomb waiting to go off. If grandpa\u2019s going to play favorites to this extent, he can deal with the way it makes people feel. He\u2019s a dick to leave that for his \u201cloved ones\u201d to deal with when he dies and they\u2019re trying to mourn his death.\n\nYour boyfriend is comfortable letting his own sister make long-term plans that he knows are going to fall apart. That\u2019s kind of gross to me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d be able to maintain a relationship with someone who could do that to people they call family. It sounds like you and your friend actually look out for each other, though, so it seems like you prioritized the right relationship.\n\nI\u2019m sure what you did has made her feel loved and protected when her own family didn\u2019t even give her that, and that\u2019s worth all these silly YTA judgments. You did the right thing, not the \u201ctechnically right\u201d thing, and Reddit loves the technically right thing.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that your BF expected you to keep this lie for him. Grandpa is free to leave his money to who he wants, but if he\u2019s lying to your friend, than he is T A.", "I'm having a hard time with this one. Yea for sure she caused a rift in the family but it was going to happen at some point or another and when that point comes then she also has people blaming her because she didn't tell her best friend before hand. She probably knew her best friend before and has a loyalty to her too. I think everyone is an asshole here. No one should have to bear the weight of a secret like that knowing keeping it will end in the demise of her best friend. Kind of shitty that her boyfriend would want to keep this secret from his sister, which would make me look at my boyfriend a little different. I really don't know if anyone is more to blame here. Like I said op is getting a lot of shit for saying something now from her bf and his grandfather but she would have gotten the blame of the whole family and her best friend in the end....unless everyone on here thinks that she should lie to her best friend later on when she asks her if she knew. Tbh the grandfather is the biggest asshole here. He changed his mind and decided to keep it from the whole family while lying to them and wanting the drama to happen after he's gone and doesn't have to deal with it.", "Nta I would've told my best friend to so she has a head up to find other finicial means.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA because I\u2019ve worked in wills and estates law. What the grandfather is doing to his family is horrible and he deserves all the drama and hate coming to him. Your boyfriend could have been taken to court and the estate held in probate for YEARS if the grandfather had gotten away with this. Everyone involved would have contested it and it would have turned into a shit show. This is the exact reason you don\u2019t surprise your whole family after you die by using a secret will to fuck them all. Depending on how old and potentially close to his death he is, the courts may not even honor a late will that suddenly cut his entire family out, they would view that as potentially indicative of a loss of his mental faculties. They would also investigate whether or not your boyfriend pressured or took advantage of his grandfather to be the only one named in the will. \n\nYou were looking out for your BEST FRIEND who will be directly impacted by your boyfriend and his grandfather\u2019s LIES.

Why did you specifically chose to break his trust ?", "You value your friendship more than your boyfriend.  It's difficult to hear someone claim to care when their actions scream so loud.

In my opinion I wouldn\u2019t have discussed inheritances or made promises before my death, especially if there\u2019s multiple people involved, because there\u2019s too much room for drama which is what happened. Unwise.\n\nBoyfriend: I don\u2019t feel like he really did anything wrong, he was receiving the info and honestly I see him telling his gf to be reasonable esp since she was right there. It\u2019s possible there\u2019s more at play here and maybe he should stop being mad at her and more at the situation, but this drama was going to happen anyway whenever the will came out.\n\nThe gf: Yes received privileged information, yes not really any of her business, and yes maybe she prioritized her open honesty with her best friend over the request of her boyfriend, but either way someone was going to feel let down. This was a no-win for op and honestly the situation being brought to light while it can still be discussed by the family is probably better than grandpa dying and everyone being at each other\u2019s throats after the fact.\n\nBest friend: Blabbed to the entire family which was probably a bad idea.

Although, I also find it unwise to rely on money you don\u2019t even have yet or put yourself in a spot where a family member\u2019s death has the power to cause a rift over money.\n\nOverall I think everyone sucks or doesn\u2019t suck pretty equally, aside from maybe grandpa.
