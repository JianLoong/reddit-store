Not to encourage her to have sex, but so that she knows that when she does actually feel ready for it she can know that she is in control of her own body and not reliant on a guy to use a condom correctly (but of course please still educate her that a condom of some form is still important for STI protection, as well as getting tested!", "NTA.

As someone who got the whole sex ed talk and has done the deed with (at the time boyfriend) ex, the fact that we BOTH knew what it meant, the consequences and the proper care sure didn't stop us from doing it, but it definitely made ME conscious of things like my cycle and health.

We had a pretty good, comprehensive sex education class, that we had to take when we were 12 and 15? I think, in school. My parents added to it, we will get you anything you need condoms, birth control whatever, also did the these are the facts on drugs etc. Then were just like, you have all the information, don't fuck up your life.

OP talked about it, but hoping that talk included a trip to the doctor for birth control pills and then a trip to the store to stock up on condoms. Like especially if he already caught them having sex or about to, the ship has sailed, time to make sure it is safe. My friend had a condom drawer in the bathroom for her teens.

I explained that I would MUCH prefer her to abstain, but that if curiosity got the best of her, to come to me.

You did a great job.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nThe kind of education you provided is exactly what is missing in so many southern/conservative US states(not sure your location). It's why Texas sucks inappropriate objects when it comes to teenage pregnancy stats, maternal mortality rate, and others.\n\nKeep advocating for your child, and her current partner.

Bailey is lucky to have you", "You are NTA. she can't waltz in and take over the sex education of a child she hasn't seen in 10 years. Seriously, what has she been doing in those years she disappeared? NOT parenting and teaching her child how to keep herself safe from pregnancy and infection in a sexual relationship.

You told her and her bf, what I wish my parents had told my older brother so I wouldn\u2019t have had to help raise his kids when I was 10.  You told her what I wish my parents had told me when I was younger so I wouldn\u2019t have done the unsafe things I did. It is better for your daughter to be educated on sex, to know what is safe and what to do if something goes wrong, rather than be uninformed and still so it anyway. Take it from someone who is a teen, parents/others can tell us sex is bad all they want but most/a lot of us will still do it anyway. We\u2019re curious by nature and want to learn our own bodies and such. You\u2019re teaching her it is natural and how to be safe. Her \u201cmom\u201d is trying to scare and shame her for being a teenager and for wanting to do something that is natural and innate to us as humans. And as for those who think you\u2019re teaching her to be a sl*t, do your best to ignore them. They\u2019re still trapped in like the 1970s or so.

Many people had the attitude that telling kids the truth only made them want sex more. Which is likely why my school ended up with so many teenage parents. \n\nSex education is an absolute must for young adults. You did the right thing. \n\nAnd you're not incorrect about Bailey's mother. You can't just abandon a child and expect to have full parental rights when it's convenient for you to come back.

I allowed things I never should have, things I deeply regret simply because I didn\u2019t know better.\n\nWhat you are doing is giving your child the information needed to make a informed decision about her body. This is a incredibly important and valuable thing you\u2019ve done. You\u2019ve taught her that not only can she trust you with big things, but that you\u2019ll treated her like the young adult she is and promoted bodily autonomy. This will help her so much in the long run. \n\nI only have a one and a half year old, but you\u2019re the type of parent I aim to be as he grows and starts facing these type of situations.

She has no right to pop in when your kid is almost adult and act like she\u2019s been parenting the whole time. \n\nNot to mention that celibacy only education has been proven not to work. Idk if she knows this, but teens are known to not listen to their parents and sneak around them to do things theyre told not to do. A teenager is like a wildfire.

Happy birthday to Bailey.  Cheers.", "Bailey's birthgiver is wrong on every account.

You did what a proper parent did and ensured your child had the ability to make a proper and informed choice.

If she is at an age where she feels comfortable discovering her sexuality, she should be armed with the confidence of education and knowledge. You have given her that. It sounds like there are still many in our society that want to shame teens for having a natural sex drive, and then threaten them with the \"consequence\" of pregnancy. But sex is about so much more than just procreation, and there is a world of pleasure and a weight of responsibility that goes along with it. You have given Bailey the balance of both and that is what good parents do. Allowing our teens to remain ignorant, and hope they'll ignore their impulses and choose abstinence is antiquated and foolish. And finally, pregnancy is not a consequence. It's not a punishment. Pregnancy should be something that is entered into with a clear and sober mind. A person can't do that if they aren't armed with knowledge. You have provided Bailey with that. This makes you an excellent and thoughtful parent. \n\nBailey's birth-giver needs to take a minute and get to know the young woman her offspring has become. She gave up her \"rights\" to parent her when she walked out the door.", "All I am saying is there is no way I know of to prevent pregnancy, if people knew of a better way than we wouldn\u2019t have the sad realities of what we have and that\u2019s obviously true and that\u2019s all I am saying."]}
