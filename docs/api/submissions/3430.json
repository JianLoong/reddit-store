Bailey has been asking questions about certain things regarding sex, after this I had walked in on her and her boyfriend I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll fill the blanks. I called his parents to ask permission to have this talk with them and they had agreed and said they\u2019d like to talk to them as well. We talked, im not going to have a \u201cthese are the consequences, don\u2019t do it\u201d attitude, they are curious and stupid sometimes, my job is to protect them, not *wait* for a consequence to happen, I talked with them about everything they had to know. Protection, before and after care, consent, doctors, just all sex Ed and more I\u2019m sure a lot of people will disagree with this, but instead of being naive I am going to educate them, \n\nIssue at hand:\nI guess Bailey talked to her mom about this, and she told Bailey that she was crazy, she will get pregnant, showed her a video of pregnancy, showed her what STD\u2019s look like, assured her she\u2019d get one and with words I won\u2019t say slut shamed her. Then came to me asking why i would tell kids something like that and I was ridiculous and irresponsible. \n\nI proceeded to tell her that what\u2019s ridiculous is thinking that will stop anything, at best it would do that periodically, then \u201csomething\u201d *will* happen because they weren\u2019t educated, *that\u2019s bad parenting* So yes, I educated my kid on how to do things *safely* instead of having them doing things that could hurt baileys or her boyfriends body\u2019s permanently, cause pregnancy, you get the point. \n\nShe kept going at me saying that I was irresponsible, I was being naive, I was letting my daughter whore around, I was just asking for her to get pregnant, and encouraging her to be a s. \n\nshe kept going back and forth and something just said that she hasn\u2019t been in her life for a decade and has no idea how Bailey understands things, how she was parented, or anything, why am I even entertaining this? I told her \u201cKathy, your opinion doesn\u2019t matter, you are not her parent and you don\u2019t have any rights to her, you don\u2019t even know her, so they way I parent my daughter isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s concern but mine. Until you can tell me so much as what her favorite color is, please don\u2019t go out of bounds like this\u201d \n\nShe got pissed saying I was being an asshole I was undermining her and she gave birth to her and she has every say, especially when I am being irresponsible parent and trying to bring up the past to get away from my bad parenting isn\u2019t going to do that. \n\nI said that I won\u2019t entertain her issue with this and to never say what she did to Bailey.

She is almost an adult, she knows the basics but she didnt know everything, am I expected to just let her go off into the world not knowing the basics of these things and how to protect herself and others ?", "As the parent of older girls (21, 24) , you did EXACTLY what you should have done.\n\nSo no NTA \n\n\nYou telling a teenager not to do something is akin to waving a red flag in front of a bull", "NTA.

Like, 0% the asshole.\n\nI hope eventually Kathy understand that **she is not a parent** : she was just the incubator. Giving birth doesn't make you a parent.\n\nShe doesn't deserve the \"mom\" title. It's not something that is just handed out. It needs to be earned. Until she needs to be part of her kid's life, learns how to interact with her and MORE IMPORTANTLY, how to co-parent correctly with you, she will just remain... the incubator.", "NTA, your daughter is 17 - she will find a way to do what she wants. I agree with the sex ed, so all consenquences are known up front.  Mother has no say as she gave up that right when she walked away as a child.  Daughter is now a young adult - while its nice shes back, she can not expect to jump right in.", "So she walked out without so much as a see y\u2019a later 10 years ago. Not she has decided that she wants to be a parent again? Kids are not like toys you can\u2019t get bored and put them in the attic till you have a bout of nostalgia and pull them out for a bit. I don\u2019t know about the legal rights but in my opinion she lost the right to me a parent to your daughter. You are NTA for parenting your own child. You are correct she needs to stay in hers own lane.", "NTA.\n\nYou're being a responsible parent. She hasn't been a parent, she still isn't acting like a good one, and she obviously needed to hear it. You were just straightforward. \n\nGood on you.", "Nta\nYou're doing the right thing; teaching your daughter how to stay safe, and not letting her birth mother get away with strong arming her way into an authority position.\nThe balls on this woman, to think she just waltz back in 10 years later and think she's in charge \ud83d\ude44", "Why have you allowed her back into your lives? Was this done slowly and with Bailey having therapy to help her work through whatever she is feeling having her mother who abandoned her suddenly back into her life? No mentally stable person abandons their child - and no mentally unstable person should be trusted with the responsibility of parenting. You set the ground rules. You see that Kathy follows them. Sounds like you now have two kids on your hands. Do what is best for Bailey (not Kathy). And if it becomes clear that Bailey was better off not having her mom in her life, then you have a right to remove her from it until she can respect your rules and boundaries. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Does Bailey even want her mom in her life at this point? After the way she spoke she might not but is afraid of her moms reaction. Ask Bailey. She is old enough to decide if she wants to see her or not.", "NTA. Your daughter is only a year away from being an adult. And you are absolutely right that you won't stop a teenager from having sex if they really want to. Educating her on being safe is absolutely the best thing you can do. Studies show that teems who are well educated on safety and consent, as well as what alternative forms of pleasure there are besides sex are more likely to wait to have sex because they have the proper knowledge to speak up for themselves, not feel as pressured or feel more comfortable standing up for themselves, etc.  Please also consider getting your daughter on birth control asap. Not to encourage her to have sex, but so that she knows that when she does actually feel ready for it she can know that she is in control of her own body and not reliant on a guy to use a condom correctly (but of course please still educate her that a condom of some form is still important for STI protection, as well as getting tested!", "NTA.   You are being responsible and Kathy is trying to make you feel bad for her crappy life choices.", "NTA. At all. \n\nThe fact you have even allowed your daughters birth mom to contact her should make that woman more than grateful. \n\nBut the plain and simple fact here is that YOU and your DAUGHTER did the hard work. That \u201cmother\u201d has no say and you were completely right in snapping at her after the way she talked to your daughter. Doesn\u2019t matter if she gave birth or not. \n\nSlut shaming? Hell nah, get that lady out of your life and make sure your daughter knows she is loved by you immensely after the horrible words she just had to put up with.\n\nI\u2019m just sorry you have to clean up this mess. I hope your daughter is alright.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSmall addition, the sex ed you gave your daughter was very responsible of you, especially including the other parents as well. Huge win parenting-wise. Don\u2019t doubt yourself in that OP!", "Imma lurk here for a bit given there are no answers and I'm somewhat confused to the whole \"daughter's mom\" as I don't understand it well. Does it mean that you're akin her stepmom? \n\nBut what I find funny is, were that to be the case, the woman had the audacity to argue how \"sex ed is the same as telling them go have sex\" to a pair of teens. As someone who got the whole sex ed talk and has done the deed with (at the time boyfriend) ex, the fact that we BOTH knew what it meant, the consequences and the proper care sure didn't stop us from doing it, but it definitely made ME conscious of things like my cycle and health. As you point out, teens are dumb (and I was one). \n\nTherefore, based solely on what's written AS OF NOW, NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A lot of parents just try to scare their children, it doesn't work. Teenagers will have sex if they want to. The worst thing to do is make them so scared to be slut shamed that if they *do* run into trouble, they feel they can't come to you. You had honest, open communication and made sure that Bailey knows she can come to you. Kathy used the scare tactic, which may put Bailey off for a bit but it won't last AND could create a fear of a perfectly natural thing. Teenagers should be taught not to fear sex, and to be confident in practicing it safely. More children need parents like you, and I only hope I can do as good a job one day. NTA at all OP."]}
