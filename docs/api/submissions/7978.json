Me and Kate also have a daughter 'Emma' (3) together. Liz doesn't call me dad and usually refers to me as Mr my last name. I'll be honest that this bothered me a little, but this is what Liz feels comfortable with so I never pushed it. We're not close but we have a good relationship overall, and she loves Emma.\n\nWe weren't able to get together with my side of the family over Christmas, so my family had a late Christmas/New Year's gathering where my mom gave her Christmas gifts for the grandkids. She got Emma some toys and Liz a sketch pad (she's an artist so it's not a random gift). Liz (and Kate) were disappointed, and Kate pulled my mom aside later (I was around) to say she shouldn't have given the gifts out in front of everyone and Liz is hurt.\n\nBasically my mom ended up replying she went out of her way to get Liz a gift as a grandma, when Liz doesn't even consider me any kind of father figure. If they (Liz and Kate) have such an issue with the gifts, they can go ask Liz's real father for a gift.\n\nKate caused a bit of a scene and didn't take that comment well, and said my mom has \"no respect\" for them. I tried to calm it down, and I did tell mom she was being a little harsh. I also told Kate she was causing a scene and blowing this up for no reason, and she was the one nitpicking about gifts and mom just responded to her.\n\nKate later got angry with me for saying that and said I should've defended her. It's been a couple of weeks and she's still a little upset with me. I don't think I'm really in the wrong here and most of my family agree. My brother said I should post on here if this is still causing issues, so AITA?\n\nEdited for people asking - Liz's sketch pad was significantly less expensive than the toys and things the other kids got, but it is something she'd use and not a random item", "created_utc": 1674395607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ik5fo/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_was_causing_a_scene/", "score": 7105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You mentioned this in comments: \n\nYour mother gave Emma $100 worth of gifts. And Liz's father is dead. \n\n\nSo that really changes the tone of all this. Your mother has issue with how a child is behaving. And decided to embarrass her in front of everybody.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nThis is why I always try and comment after I've seen a few comments from OP. I would've gone N T A/E S H route at first.\n\n*All the toys and things together were worth around $100. I'll admit Liz's sketch pad wasn't nearly as much, more dollar store type, so yes I do understand them feeling upset and having the gifts given out in front of everyone. Kate went off at mom because she said she shouldn't have given gifts out in front of everyone and Liz was hurt, and then mom made the comment that Liz should go ask her real dad for a \"better\" gift.*\n\nSo Liz's gift was significantly less/cheaper than the other people's gifts. Even going off the post, it seems OP's wife was upset that Liz got the gift in front of everyone, not the actual gift itself. I think this is valid - she watches everyone else get a bunch of cool items, while she gets a dollar store sketchpad.\n\nBut OP's mom's comment about the real father is what seals the AH judgement. OP's comments below:\n\n*My mom doesn't really like that Liz doesn't call me dad, and she has said before that Liz is welcome to go ask her real father for anything instead of me. Kate got really mad because my mom made that comment but I think she was overreacting.*\n\n*I didn't think it was okay, mom's made the comment about asking Liz's father for things she wants before and I told her it's harsh, considering he's passed away. I just thought Kate was blowing it up and nitpicking about gifts.*\n\nOP's mom has made the comment before about asking her biological dad for things. Liz's biological dad is **dead**. I'm 100% sure OP's mom knows this. She, on purpose, tells a teenager that she should ask her dad for gifts, **knowing her dad is dead**.\n\nThis is horrific OP. Seriously. You are 100% the AH for not defending your wife in this instance, even with the gift issue and a million times more knowing about her **dead father**.\n\nDo better please.", "Based off the additional op comments, yeah YTA, and so is your mother. Liz is 17, and was given a cheap sketch pad that probably isn't even the grade/value she normally uses, whereas everyone else had meaningful, thoughtful gifts. \n\nYour mother needs to keep out of you family dynamic with that \"ask your real father\" bullshit. Obviously there's a reason Liz doesn't. And you can't expect someone you've known for a handful of years to call you dad just because your with their mother. It sounds like both you and your mom hold resentment against a young adult that is literally just bring polite.\n\nEdit: HOLD UP HER FATHER QUITE LITERALLY ISNT IN THE PICTURE BECAUSE HES DEAD AND YOUR MOTHER STILL MADE THAT REMARK?!? AND ALL YOU SAID WAS \"thats harsh\"? Doubling down on my answer now wtf", "\u201cmost of my family agree\u201d. I think I found your problem. You involve others in your marriage. YTA. Your mom shouldn\u2019t feel involved enough to try to defend you by making your stepdaughter see things your way.", "YTA this child\u2019s \u201creal dad\u201d is dead, you cold-hearted man. It doesn\u2019t matter how this bothers you, your mother should never have made such a pointed, intentional statement about it. I\u2019m sure she had this whole thing planned out.", "Info:\n\nWas there a significant different in the price of the sketch pad and the toys? What kind of sketch pad was it? What kind of toys? \n\nWhat were Liz and Kate expecting?\n\n\nEDIT TO SAY YTA\n\n\n$100 vs $1. It\u2019s not even the price difference but how insulting that gift is. There are nicer sketchpads. There are gift cards. There are cute art supplies. It didn\u2019t have to be $100 but it could have been thoughtful! \n\nAnd the comment was insane! Her father passed away and you guys do this to her!!???", "INFO: Was there an obvious, large, discrepancy in the gifts? Like littlun got a fancy doll house and ten accessories and Liz got a sketch pad? \n\n\nYour mom's line to \"ask her real father\" is quite telling in this situation. It leads me to question whether Liz fitting in with you and your mom is more on her or both of you maintaining an attitude that you aren't her dad. \n\n\nIt sounds like a lot of entitlement from Liz on the surface, she was considered for a gift, made part of the experience, and a 17 year old causing a scene over gifts around toddlers does sound a bit extreme. \n\n\nAll of that being said, your mom's line was cruel, your daughter is old enough not to make a stink over gifts, and your wife sounds out of line in how she treated your mom. I don't really have an acronym for this but NTA?", "I don't feel theres enough info here. A lot of times, in posts like these, theres a problem with the grandparent favoring biological grandkids and that comment from you mom saying your wife should ask Liz's real father for a gift definitely gives me pause, especially with other posts like I mentioned being a thing.\n\nEDITING TO VOTE YTA especially after knowing the bio dad is dead.", "So your mother gave everyone else multiple gifts and only gave your stepdaughter a dollar store sketch pad (not even an art kit, just a sketch pad) which 100% felt like a slap in the face to her, and when your mother made the unnecessary comment about her real father you still thought that was ok? Yeah YTA", "Things OP very conveniently left out of the post but wrote in the comments: \n\n1. Liz's biological dad is DEAD, which his family knows and yet he still believes his wife is \"overreacting\" over the comment his mother made about her real dad getting Liz something. \n\n2. OP's mother has a problem with Liz not calling him dad so this gift is quite literally a punishment for to Liz. \n\n3. Liz got a DOLLAR STORE present while the other kids got over 100$ worth of presents - OP's wife said she should have given the presents in private if there was going to be such obvious favoritism which in my opinion is fair. \n\nYTA OP. Majorly. And if I was your wife, I would rethink this whole marriage.", "Info... why was Liz hurt?\n\neta \u2014 after reading (MORE) of your comments \u2014- YTA!!\n\nYour mom was an ah (dollar store sketch pad - seriously) Kate was an ah (don\u2019t tell people what to do in their own home & expect a hug) Liz is old enough to understand your weird family dynamic (calls you Mr... ????) and you did nothing to help. What a mess...\n\nEDIT MORE \u2014 WHAT?!? Liz\u2019s father is dead ... & you said nothing to your Mom about her ridiculously mean comments??? WTF!! How are you confused about why your wife is angry?!? Since you\u2019re still confused & think you did nothing wrong... let\u2019s clear that mystery up! YOU ARE WRONG", "So your mom spent a $100+ on the other kids and got your step daughter a dollar store sketchpad and you\u2019re wondering why your wife is mad? Of course YTA. \n\nYour mother made it a point to be an AH to a young teen in front of the other kids. Well done, because now your wife and kid are never going to want spend Christmas with your family again.", "YTA- after reading the additional information in comments. All the other kids got multiple gifts totalling over $100 and Liz got a dollar store Sketch pad. Your Mom knows Liz\u2019s Dad is dead so saying \u201cask your real father\u201d is especially cruel and hateful. You most definitely should have stood up for them in the moment and after.", "YTA and your mother too.  You entered Lizs life when she was a teenager.  She will never see you as a father figure.  Not seeing you as a father figure does not mean she doesn\u2019t like you or does not respect you.  Sounds like a polite young lady.  Liz should not pay the price because you  and your mothers egos are bruised that she doesn\u2019t see you as a father.  Liz came to the family gathering and was given a cheap token gift.  She had to sit there while everyone else opened their multiple meaningful gifts.  I have a niece I am literally estranged from.  I still send gifts for her stepson at Christmas and his birthday.  He gets the same number of gifts as my others nieces children and I do my best to make them gifts he really likes or wants.  Because I believe that kids should not have to pay the bill for adult issues.", "Info. \n\nI think there\u2019s an underlying reason why the daughter was upset. I don\u2019t want to assume the worse and just invalidate her feelings off the bat. For example: the bio daughter could have gotten 300$ worth of presents while Liz got a sketch pad from Staples. I\u2019m only using that as a hypothetical. Again, in an effort to be fair, I think we need more information as to why Liz is upset. \n\nI will caution though, it\u2019s an extremely a$$hole-y thing to bring up Liz\u2019 biological dad during a disagreement. That \u201cshe went out of her way\u201d for someone who isn\u2019t even her biological daughter is extremely harsh toward anyone, specially a teen. Do not place children in the center of a fight. Your wife did the right thing in taking your mom aside to have this conversation. I\u2019d blown up too if someone not only brought up her biological dad in that context, but also said she should be happy she got ANYTHING at all. It makes it seem like Liz is a burden, and that attitude is such a red flag. I\u2019m glad you agree that it was harsh - but it wasn\u2019t \u201ca little harsh\u201d. It was VERY harsh, and I hope this attitude isn\u2019t displayed in front of Liz.\n\nEdit: holy shit. I read thru the comments. You may not be the a$$hole but your mom certainly is.  There\u2019s clear favoritism toward biological grandchild that is not being addressed. Your wife just wants to protect both her children.", "INFO:  What did Kate get for your mom?  Why would opening the gifts in a private setting have been any better?  Did your nieces and nephews receive substantially better gifts? \n\nDo Kate and Liz ever see your mother outside of holiday gatherings?  \n\nThere is context missing here.  It makes no sense to be upset over the gifts unless there was a good reason to expect more.  \n\nWithout any further context I vote ESH.  Your wife and SD were rude to complain.  Your mom should not punish Liz for her refusal to call you \u201cDad.\u201d\n\nEDITED: After reading additional information about your Mom, it\u2019s apparent that mom is the A H.  Your wife and stepdaughter need to be protected from her nasty attitude.", "Question. If something happened to you and you died. Your wife remarries. Would you be ok with someone treating your daughter Emma like your mother treats Liz? I'm betting no. YTA. Your mother is a complete and total Ahole. You know it. Kate and Liz know it and someday Emma will too.", "YTA. That crack your mother made about go ask liz\u2019s \"real father\u201d for a nice present was low down. *Somebody* told your stepdaughter years ago that she should address you as Mr. Lastname and so she has and nobody, including you or her mother, has authorized her to be less formal *Was it your mother* who directed your stepdaughter to call you Mr. Lastname. There seem to be a lot of micro aggressions going on that you choose to ignore.

Liz (and Kate) were disappointed, and Kate pulled my mom aside later (I was around) to say she shouldn't have given the gifts out in front of everyone and Liz is hurt.\n\nthis is a problem.  Did other grandkids get more elaborate gifts?", "INFO: what reason did Liz give that she was hurt? I feel like there's maybe some history here that's being left out.", "Yta for allowing Liz be left out. I don't see the big deal in the parental label I'd rather have a good relationship with the person then be so wrapped up in labels. When you married your wife she was a package deal woman and child.

Like easily and it's weird you and your mom like picking on a kid so much. Personally, I'd get that checked in therapy but you're obtuse enough to need to post HERE so, yeah... Tell your stepdaughter that I'm so sorry for her. Oh and another quick YTA for good measure", "So I see alot wrong with this story:\n\nMostly, Liz's dad is dead, and your mom said to ask him for a gift. That's cold and heartless.

What's the story behind that? \n\nLiz is a 17 year old and by no fault of her own she is involved with your family,  she should be made to feel welcome by the adults, not given some crumbs because she a step kid. \n\nYou mention that she was into art and would use the sketchpad so the gift was justified in your and your mom's mind... I bet sometimes she is thirsty and hungry, maybe next year for Christmas, you and your mom can spring for some bread and water instead of a stupid pad?\n\n\nThere's more than one asshole in your story, but they aren't Liz or your wife.

Congratulations, YTA and your mom also!", "YTA at first I was leaning towards everyone sucks. \nYou\u2019re mom is a piece of work for sure, a dollar store sketch pad compared to $100 worth of toys? Really?\nYour wife probably shouldn\u2019t have brought it up, but I get why she did. \nBut you.. you allow your mother to tell your stepdaughter to ask her real dad for better things why you know he\u2019s dead? \nYou sir, are the worst.", "So, I have the benefit of being able to judge this after reading your enlightening comments on this thread that add more context to the whole situation. \n\nOn the surface, it appears to be a mom and daughter being a bit ungrateful for a gift your mother picked out, but in your comments, you reveal:\n\n1) Your biological child was given *many* gifts from your mother, in excess of $100 worth of presents, while Liz's sketch pad (the one and only thing she was given) was something you suspect came from the Dollar Store. \n\n2) Your mother holds a grudge against your stepdaughter because she doesn't call you \"dad.\"\n\n3) Your mother has on more than one occasion told your wife and daughter that they can go to Liz's biological father for things, when she knows very well that ***the biological father is dead.***\n\nI mean, *wow.* With the added context, it seems like the \"gift\" from your mother to Liz was nothing more than another mean-spirited jab. Your mother is clearly singling out Liz and trying her best to make her feel \"less-than\" and excluded. Meanwhile, you confront *your wife* about \"making a scene?\" Again, ***WOW.***\n\nStand up for your wife and Liz, dude. Your mom is being a bully and YTA.", "YTA and so is your mother.  Your mother clearly favored her biograndkid(s) for petty reasons.\n\nYour future ex-wife pulled her MIL aside - could have made much more of a scene - and your mother brings up dead biodad?  Nope.  Anyone who thinks your stepkid and soon-to-be-ex are overreacting are also TA.", "YTA\n\nYour mother didn't even try with her gift.  The sketch pad as you stated was significantly less money than the rest of the gifts.  All your wife said was maybe the gifts shouldn't have been passed out in front of her daughter. Your mother decided to unleash all her spite about your step daughter not treating yall as family. Then when your wife is justified in being upset you tell her she's causing a scene. Not your mother who insulted your wife and step child.  Has it occurred to you that maybe Liz doesn't treat you and your family as her relatives because y'all make it obvious that you will never view her as anything other than an outsider?\nOh and I just read a comment that Liz's father is dead. That makes your mother's shitty comment even more gross", "So your mom is punishing a child who was in her teens when you and her mom got together because she doesn't see you as her father when she already has a father a father who died no less? Well I can definitely see why she doesn't see you as a father figure when your okay with your family treating her as other than, hopefully your wife wakes up before her daughter goes LC.\n\n\nYTA", "It\u2019s not a child\u2019s job to carry the relationship with adults. You are her step father regardless of what honorific she uses to address you. You allowed your mother to play obvious favorites among the grandchildren and embarrass your step daughter.

Your wife is not causing a scene for stating that both her kids need to be treated equally.

Ok WTF OP - YTA. \n\nI get what people are saying about Liz\u2019s entitlement, but - hey - she\u2019s a teenager and might feel a little alienated. Especially in the moment after opening an underwhelming gift. I think we\u2019ve all felt disappointed by gifts at some point. \n\nRegarding Liz\u2019s place in your family: yes she is part of your family, regardless of how she addresses you. Personally I don\u2019t think she should call you dad (she\u2019s too old for that to feel natural). \n\nIt might have been better if your wife talked to Liz, and taught a lesson about how material gifts aren\u2019t tied to familial love. But I could see how this situation would strike at that step-kid insecurity about belonging in the family. \n\nYour wife tried to handle this discretely by pulling grandma aside, but grandma (also TA) clearly escalated the situation. \n\nOP, your mom\u2019s rude comments confirmed everything Liz felt when she opened her disappointing gift. That she\u2019s not part of the family; she\u2019s not welcome. \n\nYou had a choice in that moment as to whether you defended your wife and daughter, but chose not to. \n\nHere\u2019s why you\u2019re TA: you had a chance to act like Liz\u2019s dad and you failed.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the most likely outcome here: They just won't visit your mom for christmas any more.", "NTA, the Christmas gift was not a random gift like socks or toiletries.

The fact that you didn\u2019t blow up at your mother about that says it all. And your wife was right, she shouldn\u2019t have handed out gifts in front of everyone.

You and your mum suck, plain and simple.", "This sub seems to be all about equality between stepkids and bip kids...until the step kid doesn't call the step dad \"dad\"? Seems kinda like an arbitrary line in the sand.\n\nI'm gonna say ESH. Right after everyone got their gifts was probably not the time to bring this up, but according to Op everyone else got gifts in the $100 range and Liz got a dollar store sketchbook.

Living with an artist I know a decent sketch pad can cost a reasonable amount but everything about what you've since written make me believe it was a cheap sketch book.", "NTA it was kind of your mother to buy gifts.

That's more than harsh. I understand your mom may have been offended by their remarks, but her response was way out of line.\n\nEdit again: lol it was a dollar store sketch pad?

We've all been disappointed with a gift at some point.  We don't act out over it though.  It's a life lesson that you have to learn that you sometimes don't always get what you want and you should be thankful that someone thought enough about you to get you a gift.\n\nIt was inappropriate for your wife to share with your Mom their disappointment with the gift.  It demonstrated an ungrateful attitude and an overall lack of respect toward your Mom who was hosting a family get together in her home.\n\nThere is obviously a simmering blended family issue with you and your Mom and how your step daughter views you.  You both need to accept that you are not her father and Liz does not see you in that role.

You're resentful of a child you've known since she was at least in her early teens for not calling you what she used to call her late father. You're letting your mom treat Liz as an outsider and throw your wife's major loss in her face. You're a terrible husband, and if you weren't the one standing up to your mother about her treatment of Liz, then you don't deserve to stand as any kind of father figure for her.", "YTA and your Mom is too. Only way this would have been ok is if your Mom had put a gift card into the sketchpad. She is sneaky -your Mom and mean. I added this after reading more:\nThis kids Dad is dead. Do you know how hard it is to lose a parent as a young girl? Liz is probably calling you Mr. Whatever because she wants to hold on to her Dad in some way. Your Mom is evil and the fact that you don't see this does not make you any better either. I would not blame your wife if she went NC on your Mom and LC on you until you came to your senses and validated their feelings.", "NTA...I'm sure there's more to the overall situation,  but this all started with your wife complaining about Liz's gift.

There is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.", "NTA. You were evenhanded, you told your mom she was a bit too harsh, and your wife she was out of proportion, sounds fair.\n\nYou said you don't really like Liz calling you Mr... It seems customary that most teenagers call a step father by his first name, is that what you would prefer as well OP? She doesn't have to call you dad, but calling her mothers new husband Mr... sounds like she is emphasizing you not being close to her in a passive-agressive way. Your mom probably knows you're not happy with it but just let it go, and it no doubt annoys her.\n\nEdit: I had not yet seen the additional info that Liz bio father is dead. That made the mom comment way out of line, and OP should have sided with Kate. So I change my opinion to YTA", "I mean for one, art supplies are not cheap\u2026.

This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed. This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (42) have a step daughter 'Liz' (17) from my wife 'Kate' (42) first marriage. Me and Kate also have a daughter 'Emma' (3) together. Liz doesn't call me dad and usually refers to me as Mr my last name. I'll be honest that this bothered me a little, but this is what Liz feels comfortable with so I never pushed it. We're not close but we have a good relationship overall, and she loves Emma. \n\nWe weren't able to get together with my side of the family over Christmas, so my family had a late Christmas/New Year's gathering where my mom gave her Christmas gifts for the grandkids. She got Emma some toys and Liz a sketch pad (she's an artist so it's not a random gift). Liz (and Kate) were disappointed, and Kate pulled my mom aside later (I was around) to say she shouldn't have given the gifts out in front of everyone and Liz is hurt. \n\nBasically my mom ended up replying she went out of her way to get Liz a gift as a grandma, when Liz doesn't even consider me any kind of father figure. If they (Liz and Kate) have such an issue with the gifts, they can go ask Liz's real father for a gift.\n\nKate caused a bit of a scene and didn't take that comment well, and said my mom has \"no respect\" for them. I tried to calm it down, and I did tell mom she was being a little harsh. I also told Kate she was causing a scene and blowing this up for no reason, and she was the one nitpicking about gifts and mom just responded to her. \n\nKate later got angry with me for saying that and said I should've defended her. It's been a couple of weeks and she's still a little upset with me. I don't think I'm really in the wrong here and most of my family agree. My brother said I should post on here if this is still causing issues, so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Seems like you\u2019re mostly a bystander.\n\nYour mom did a low blow, and you told her as much. It seems like there\u2019s a lot of lingering resentment in your family. From Liz, from your mom, etc.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna get into comparing dollar values or gifts, because once you start with that, you\u2019ve already lost.\n\nLiz is *seventeen*, not seven. She\u2019s on the verge of being an adult. If she\u2019s an aspiring artist, she probably already has a bunch of tools, and a dollar store sketch pad isn\u2019t gonna help her out. At that point, she probably wants/needs an iPad Pro or Surface Pro, or maybe something from Wacom, not a silly sketch pad. So I can see how that gift seemed like an insult. It would\u2019ve been better to consult with her (again, she\u2019s seventeen, she doesn\u2019t exactly believe in Santa any more); maybe she would\u2019ve liked a new Wacom pen.\n\nSo, NTA, because this is mostly not on you in particular, but your family needs work.", "YTA and so is your mom.\n\nLiz\u2019s dad is DEAD and she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable calling you dad, which is totally and completely understandable. But you\u2019re bothered by this for some petty reason and therefore allow your mom to mistreat her.", "YTA. Your post is missing key information. First off your stepdaughter\u2019s dad is dead, so you should have defended your wife against your mom with the comments. It was a super cheap gift compared to the other daughter so obviously your stepdaughter would be disappointed and your wife upset. Also why does she call you mr so and so? That\u2019s weird, she should be calling you by your first name.", "YTA\n\nLiz's real dad is DEAD!! And you didn't go off on your mother for her incredibly cruel comment. Your mother used this Christmas celebration to put down Liz and Kate, because she knew exactly what she was doing. \n\nIt's no wonder Liz calls you MR Surname the way you let your mother treat her. You do not behave like a stepfather, either, you don't deserve anything resembling a \"father\" title.", "So glad I read your comments before responding. YTA, a HUGE one. Lizs father is dead, your mother was not only completely out of line but also a huge AH. I cannot believe you would stand by and defend her after what she said, that would be divorce grounds for me. So liz has to sit and watch everyone else get lots of gifts while all she got was a notebook? Oh but according to you that\u2019s okay because she\u2019s use it? That doesn\u2019t matter here, she didn\u2019t get a gift as a grandma as she obviously likes to think she\u2019s being so great for, she got a gift because she\u2019d be able to say \u201cbut I got her a gift what\u2019s the issue\u201d it\u2019s no wonder why liz calls you mr last name, you can\u2019t even stand up to your family and make Kate and Liz feel included, just wow", "YTA and I wouldn't b surprised if u end up with divorce papers in front of u at some point....u are not Liz's father and u don't deserve to b called such just because u married her mother would u like it if another man came in an wanted Ur 3yr old to call them dad no u wouldn't YTA", "YTA\n\nYour mom for the dollar store gift, making that real dad comment (when he is DEAD, wtf), and getting involved in your business at all.

I feel bad for Liz because this seems like shitty family dynamics.", "Editing this to change my ESH with a bit of YTA to a straight out YTA extra emphasis. I started this post before there were additional comments and was chasing a toddler around, so I missed additional comments with the additional info. Your wife should maybe have a conversation with your mom not in the moment, but wow wow wow. Your mom\u2019s comment is like a slap to the face. If my grandparents ever said that to me (and BTW, my step-grandparents and extended step family immediately welcomed me and made me feel loved, so much so that I got married with my (step) grandfather\u2019s wedding band), they would not be my family. If they ever suggested my \u201creal mother\u201d aka mom who died provide me something instead of my (step) mom, they wouldn\u2019t be my family. I feel so bad for Liz. \n\nESH, with a bit more YTA. Yes, your wife probably shouldn\u2019t have taken that moment to have a conversation with your mother, but, while you don\u2019t make it clear in narrative, my assumption is that the gifts for Liz were significantly fewer in both quantity and in quality/cost. While the actual cost of a gift isn\u2019t what is important and it\u2019s the thought, it seems clear based on the reaction and what little was provided in the narrative that the thought was that \u201cLiz\u201d is a bit of an afterthought. \n\nYou say that Liz has never really taken to you and calls you Mr. LASTNAME. You are MARRIED to her mother. Did you never think to sort this out before you married her mother? You do not just marry a person, you marry their family (most especially their kids in the case of single parents). It sounds to me like Liz, a child even at the age of 17 (and also, you have a 3 year old with her mother, so you\u2019ve been in her life at least 4 years?), has feelings that were never addressed. It also sounds like she is uncomfortable in her family unit and you have certainly done nothing to change that. You came into this littler girl\u2019s life when she was 13 years old! You should have made it a priority to ensure she feels safe and loved. Being a parent is hard job, and a step parent is often a thankless job, but if you worked to break down her boundaries and make her feel safe, you would have a better relationship with her. When my sister got married she ended up walking herself down the aisle because it broke her heart to not ask my dad (her step dad) because she was closer to him than her own father, who is still very much in her life. That didn\u2019t happen out of nowhere. He put in the work. He respected her boundaries and he made her feel safe. I asked my stepmom to adopt me (bio mom died when I was young) because I was so close to her. These things can happen, but it takes time. I\u2019m not suggesting that should be your relationship, but your step daughter should NOT be calling you Mr. LastName. Not 4 years into your relationship with her mother, not at the time you marry her mother. \n\nYour mom also sucks because it sounds like your mother adheres to the \u201cblood makes family\u201d line. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t if you saw your stepchild as part of your family, but it\u2019s clear neither you nor your mother feel that way. I\u2019m not saying Liz doesn\u2019t put up walls. I\u2019m not saying she herself doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s part of the family. But she is a child. It is all of your responsibility to make sure she knows she is loved and in the family. I imagine it\u2019s been a trend and your mother often refers to her as her step-grandchild. I\u2019ve been there and seen the impact that has on a kid\u2019s self-esteem. It also likely makes her feel very unwanted. \n\nYour wife is right, if your mother is going to treat her children differently, it would be kindest to do it outside of the presence of her daughter. Also, I don\u2019t know what was meant by your mother\u2019s comment about Liz\u2019s father. I assume it either means he is uninvolved and provides very little, or it goes to show that as long as she has another side of the family, she doesn\u2019t need yours? Either way, it\u2019s incredibly hurtful and irrelevant to the point. Your mother has no business bringing up Liz\u2019s father. Either she intended to get a nice gift for Liz and missed the mark (in which case she can ask for suggestions for the following gift giving occasion). Or, she intended it I get Liz a token gift that was clearly not up to par with what the other kids who are actually a part of the family got. \n\nYour wife is protecting her daughter. She may have done so in an obtuse way, but you all clearly need to sit down, perhaps with a family counselor, to discuss this dynamic and is harmful to a child in your household. Also, she should have ensured the proper family dynamic between you and her daughter before she got married. So yeah, ESH, but I would say you and your mother are more YTA because you don\u2019t seem to see the importance of making a child feel loved. I hope you can all assess the family unit and make sure you all feel safe and loved. \n\nI am adding that you provided no indication that Liz has any sort of behavioral issues or that she acts in ways that endanger her or her sister. It seems like she\u2019s just a kid who is unhappy in her family unit and likely had her whole life turned upside down and maybe doesn\u2019t know what to do and just feels unwanted, which is so sad.", "I am going with ESH\n\nYour mother coment was wrong but your stepdaughter is 17, not 7... she is almost an adult and is comparing herself with presents for a toddler. \n\nAt that age she should understand the dinamic about step family, she herself doesnt consider you her father, thats ok... and probably doesnt consider your mother her grandma... so, why she should expect presents at all for people she doesnt consider family?\n\nYour wife is wrong too, she shouldnt say anything to your mother and talk later kn private with you and stepdaughter.", "So my understanding is that Liz got a smaller gift from your mother. She does not consider you or your mother a step parent and step grandparent and is mad that she didn\u2019t get a large enough gift. I\u2019m sorry but respect goes both ways and it seems like your wife is enabling this behavior. \n\nYour mother does not have to get your Liz a gift at all since she refuses to consider her a grandmother figure and refuses to consider you a father figure. Your mother was nice enough to get what is a thoughtful gift for Liz- that is all that matters. Outside of the parents, no one is required to spend the exact same or roughly the same amount on children(especially children that make active decisions not to consider themselves part of the family.) I feel like Kate needs to talk to Liz about her relationship with you and how she treats you and your family. Kate also had no right to speak to your mother that way on Christmas, nor did Liz have any right to act that way at 17. If your wife had more tact, she would have called your mother a few days later and mentioned that perhaps they should handle gift giving a little differently in the future given the trickiness of the situation. \n\nNTA", "All of this and I hope your comment gets higher! And she's a CHILD. It's not her responsibility to build that relationship, it's his and his family's.

Wish I could give this 100 up votes! Now that I know Liz's father is dead....? Your mother is such the AH and you're right there with her! I don't even have words for this. No wonder your wife is still upset.", "She may well say \"Mr \" instead of just first name because he pushed the dad thing too soon. \n\nAlso, Kate pulled her aside in private - that's already trying to not make a scene - and didn't even say \"your bad gift is bad\", but \"hey, maybe you shouldn't have done this all publically\". And the mum can sod right off with this \"I got her something as a grandma\", that's not a grandma gift when all others have 100$ gifts, that's less than my parents would give a friend of mine who I brought over for whatever reason during a giftgiving session.", "This \ud83d\udcaf.

Your mother did that on purpose. A reasonable human being would\u2019ve given it in private if they gave a cheap gift to someone who they don\u2019t consider family or whatever.

I have a lot to say, especially because my heart is breaking for Kate and Liz right now.\n\nSee here\u2019s the thing, just because someone enters a child life as a parental figure in their teenage years doesn\u2019t automatically mean they\u2019ll never see this person as a parent. They will see the person as a parent when they feel fully secure that this person can be trusted like a real parent. Ergo, the existence of this post shows exactly why Liz will never see you as a father. As in you had all the chances to be accepted as a parent until you fucked up. I\u2019d like you to please show this your asshole of a mother, because she clearly plays a part in why Liz will never consider you and your family members to be real family. Your mother - not only a fully grown adult but a grandmother - is having a useless battle of egos with a teenager. \n\nFurthermore, as Emma grows older, this might also end up causing resentment and a divide between her and Liz. So what your mother is doing, in trying to pathetically satiate her own stubborn ego, is wrecking the relationship between the two girls. I also imagine Liz, deep inside, probably wants to accept you as a father figure, but she\u2019s just unsure and insecure, which is to be expected, especially from a teenager. They have so much more doubt than children, because they have the capability to think further and consider consequences. Such as deciding to trust in you and then getting hurt. But at the same time, they are so much more vulnerable than younger children in their decision making, because of this ability to think complex thoughts. Younger children aren\u2019t as complex in their thoughts thus easier to win over. As you said, Liz loves Emma. If she resented you or lacked total respect for you, she may have found it harder to love Emma. I\u2019m willing to bet that deep inside, Liz has been waiting for moments that proved to her that you could be trusted like a real father.\n\nYou had that chance here, and you fucking blew it. You fucking blew it. You were served, thanks to your asshole of a mother, the opportunity to show Liz that you consider her a daughter as you do Emma, and you not only missed it but made things worse. If your mother had done the same to Emma for some reason, I imagine your response would have been different. Although I imagine your mother would never do that to Emma since she is of blood. What a horrible, shallow, petty, bitter, and vindictive person your mother is. Tell her to grow the fuck up. Don\u2019t even get me started on the her real father comment even though her real father is dead, something you conveniently left out of the original post. I might just have a hernia if I went into that.\n\nYou say that most of your family agree, and your brother told you to post here. I imagine, based on your and your mother\u2019s behaviour, that he didn\u2019t suggest this just so you could feel validated, but so that you could show it to Kate and show her that she\u2019s in the wrong. And you should absolutely show her, because the consensus here seems to be that YTFA and your mother an even bigger one.

I have had a step dad who's been around since I was 7. I'm 23 now. I called him dad 1 time when I was 10 and I felt so guilty and wrong for doing it. I cried afterwards and luckily my step dad was a decent human being who told me I absolutely did not have to call him dad if it made me feel like I was disrespecting my real dad. Even though I never really knew him, I couldn't bring myself to call someone else that. My step dad and I are close but I didn't even have him walk me down the aisle. My brother did because I felt that if my dad can't do it, his son should. It wasn't personal and my step dad NEVER held it against me. \nI can't believe you wouldn't have stood up to your mother for making that comment about her dad getting her a gift. My mom would have had that woman on the ground before she finished that sentence so if anything I think your wife UNDERREACTED. \n\nand also tell your mom to get off her high horse about Liz accepting you as dad. News flash. You're not her replacement dad. Your mom probably didn't lose her dad as a child so therefore has no right to an opinion on what Liz should do or how she should feel. Honestly the reason you and Liz aren't that close is probably because she feels pressured to let you be her \"Dad.\"  Clearly your mom was just getting her a cheap gift that she didn't put much thought into so that nobody can bring up \"oh you didn't get Liz anything\" and she got called out for it. Didn't like it and made an evil comment.", "This wasn\u2019t meant to be a gift at all- she WANTED THE GIFT to hurt and alienate OP\u2019s stepdaughter.

They all probably feel your sour grapes that Liz doesn't call you dad, like you think she should after eight years. Guess what, if she hasn't done it in eight years she probably isn't going to. I just feel that you are feeling entitled to a title you don't even deserve if you think your mother saying \"go to your dead father for a gift\" is only \"a little harsh\" It was completely f'd up and your wife is right to be angry... She wasn't making a scene she was defending her daughter. \n\nLiz isn't required to see you as a father, and if this behavior is typical of you she really shouldn't. It takes a weak man not to stand up to his mother for his wife and daughter. You owe both your wife and step-daughter a massive apology and you need to tell your mommy that she is NEVER to say that again. From what I've read thus far you haven't earned the title of father from your step-daughter and your mother is a jerk just throwing gas on that fire. \n\nIf you want Liz to call you dad have her back once in awhile my guy. Maybe sit down with her and your wife and explain how it makes you feel that she calls you Mr. Ahole. She may even be responsive, but honestly from what I've read you don't seem like you've earned the title from her. YTA if that wasn't clear.

I have a feeling Liz still calls him Mr x cause he's never said call me Gregg or whatever else and even tried to make a connection with her let alone act like a parent or support her in any way like a dad would. He hasn't even tried to be a pal yet let alone a parent in probably five years he's known liz\n\nIf you wanted to be called dad op you needed to act like one at least, and letting your clearly evil mother be top flight awful to your step daughter would be rule one on the nono list.

You\u2019re mother sounds horribly evil and sounds like that present thing was premeditated. I feel for Liz having to be in this situation.

If he wants her to see him as a father then his parents should see her as a grandchild. Not some random kid they\u2019re obligated to put minimal effort into giving gifts. And he should defend her as he would his own child. She won\u2019t come around to see him as \u201cdad\u201d until he actually acts like a dad. His reaction to this whole situation clearly shows that he doesn\u2019t actually see his own child and his stepchild as equal.
