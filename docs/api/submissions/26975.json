The child in question was 9. My niece was a huge surprise for all of us. The last we knew my brother's ex \"Emma\" was moving for a job and wanted to end the relationship. She only reached out to my brother after all that time because she had cervical cancer and knew she had nobody to take care of their daughter \"Lucy\".\n\nMy brother met former SIL \"Shannon\" a few months after he and his ex broke up. They started dating and got married and had tried for a baby but Shannon was told she could not have a biological child due to PCOS. It broke Shannon's heart and she struggled with the news. It was about five months later that the news of Lucy broke and things spiraled.\n\nA DNA test was carried out and proved my brother was the father. He was uncertain about a place in Lucy's life after all those years of them not knowing each other. But he did step up in the end. Shannon told him she could not stay if he was the father. She could not watch him raise his child with someone else. She could never love his child with someone else and would resent them both when she couldn't have a child.\n\nAfter Shannon left she found out she was pregnant. She was told during the pregnancy that she never should have been told she couldn't have children. That the correct way of saying it would have been that it would be more difficult but certainly not impossible. Shannon was 13 weeks along when she found out she was pregnant. My brother figured that would make her want to try and make things work. But Shannon did not want to be a stepmother and said they should continue to divorce and co-parent their son \"Kai\" who was now 1.\n\nSo all in all it has been almost 2 years since they learned about Lucy and it didn't take long for the DNA results so it's close to two years since the relationship ended.\n\nMy brother went from being upset about Shannon not making it work, to pissed off, and he badmouths Shannon all the time. It got to the point where I grew tired of him saying it and I defended her. I said it was better for her to leave than to stay and treat Lucy badly when she knew she didn't want to raise her. I even asked my brother if he would have stayed had he been in Shannon's shoes. My brother said I should be on his side and not Shannon's and I'm defending the unforgivable.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694868700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k6u5f/aita_for_defending_my_former_sil_and_telling_my/", "score": 1687, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not everyone wants to be a stepparent. It\u2019s a thankless job where you are doing all the hard work of parenting while constantly being reminded you aren\u2019t the parent and you need to know your place. If she wasn\u2019t up for that job then she did the right thing by leaving. \n\nUnless she knew she was capable of treating his daughter and her son the same, and loving them the same, she would have been in the wrong for going back to your brother. Does he not love his daughter enough to see that? How hard it would have been for the little girl to see her brother grow up with a loving mom while hers was gone?", "my first thought was: wow your brother is fertile..\n\nAnyway, \n\nNTA \n\nHe should NEVER badmouth his child's parent.\n\nEspecially as the only thing she did was not giving him what HE wanted, instead of following her own feelings about the situation.", "NTA - Shannon made a tough decision that burdened your brother, but she protected Lucy just as much as herself. Would your brother prefer an unhappy, resentful household? Oh, wait...", "Brother is TA for badmouthing Shannon as they are still coparenting and that can negatively affect Kai. I can see both perspectives here though. He feels that Shannon should\u2019ve stood by him through thick and thin. He never cheated on Shannon, rather he found out after the fact about Lucy. Shannon did some self reflection and felt that in the long term she wouldn\u2019t be able to control her feelings and didn\u2019t want Lucy to receive any negativity from her that she doesn\u2019t deserve. Lots of feelings involved here.", "NTA", "NTA  \nYou're not TA for trying to explore other people's thoughts.  \nThat being said, your brother's ex(s -- both of them) are HUGE a-holes. If one can't love or care for a child just because it isn't their own, I wouldn't want to be together with them. It's not like your brother cheated on his ex-wife.   \n\n\nSo while I don't think you're an a-hole for just talking about what other people did and why they could've done it, I very much think your brother has a point. What was he supposed to do? Not take care of his own child?  \n\n\nHis ex-wife is a major a-hole.", "I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nI understand Shannon's reason for leaving (I'm childfree myself and would end a relationship so fast if it turned out my partner was a parent, even without their knowledge), thus I understand your need to defend Shannon as she did nothing wrong, but I also understand your brother feeling overwhelmed and betrayed since he's been through a lot.\n\nOkay, well, maybe there's a couple AHs, but it's none of you three. It's Lucy's mom who had a baby with your brother and never told him, then 9 years later show up out of the blue and wants him to step up to the plate to care for her child. Cowardly of her.\n\nAnd the doctor who told Shannon she could never get pregnant is also an AH. Seriously, Shannon should sue whoever that was.", "NTA - tbh it spunds like everyone but you is some level of TA\n\nThe doctor for using a definitive terms and either being clueless or just misinterpreting. \n\nShannon is to a degree as well but i do get both her and your brother were put in awful positions. Especially must have been hard based on timing with doctors input as well. \n\nForget the first mothers name but she is the one who is a complete AH in my books as she ended a relatiinship, still had kid (without your brothers knowledge,) kept it a secret and only let you brother know of kids exostence when she needed help. \n\nYour brother is def an light AH but again im simpathetic to him and shannon both to a large degree as its just a shitty situation for him. But he needs to not routinely disrespect Kai's mom regardless of situation as he gr9ws older kai will pick up on this and it will be a detriment to him. \n\n\nYour right to call out your brother, i would just try to emphasize that you understand its a shitty situation all around.", "I\u2019m on brothers side. I understood the resentment when she coudlnt have her own child, but not after she got pregnant. What\u2019s so wrong with being a stepmother? Now instead of Kai and Lucy having two parents and a stable living situation, they\u2019re going to live in different homes with their parents coparenting and hating each other. The bad mouthing doesn\u2019t make things better but when your other half does you dirty like that? He should be allowed to be angry! As his sister you should be on side. If you\u2019re tired of hearing it then say that. YTA", "ESH, I think you\u2019re right to be tired about your brother\u2019s negativity towards the situation and the sentence \u201cit was better for her to leave than to stay and treat Lucy badly\u201d is the correct outlook. It would not be healthy for one party to stay in a situation they\u2019re unhappy with, and it is not currently healthy for a co-parenting situation for one parent to continually resent the other. That said, you could have tried to have a conversation that was centered on providing understanding on what your brother feeling and trying to get him to achieve a level of forgiveness for his own sake and the wellbeing of the children and not communicating in a way that seems like you\u2019re on your former SIL\u2019s side. You shouldn\u2019t be taking sides, or if you had to take sides, say you\u2019re on the childrens\u2019 side and you want what\u2019s best for your niece and nephew. Maybe you\u2019ve tried that before and it didn\u2019t work ~~in which case he might need a therapist or other outside third party to try to deliver this information to him~~, but if this is the first time you\u2019ve had a conversation on this topic, you went about it the wrong way.\n\nFormer SIL sucks for not having the capacity to love another child (but if she can\u2019t, she can\u2019t, it\u2019s an unfortunate reality everybody has to deal with), your brother MAJORLY sucks for not being able to move on, and you hold the least responsibility in this situation, but if even you feel like you were defending your former SIL (and that\u2019s not just your brother putting words in your mouth), then you went about the conversation the wrong way.

From your Post, his Ex-GF never told him he had a kid, and has now (through no fault of her own, the Big C is horrific to deal with) torpedo'd his marriage and his now Soon-to-be Ex-Wife is now bearing his child.\n\nShannon's reaction seems *off* though. Obviously this is a 3rd hand account (since you weren't there for most of this) but something about the facts written rubs me the wrong way. The Issue was first that she couldn't/wouldn't raise Lucy while never being able to have children of her own... then when she *can* have kids of her own and is infact having a kid with the guy, she's still divorcing him anyway? It seems like she just doesn't like the idea of your Brother having had partners before her and doesn't want to raise his Ex's Daughter. She didn't want the \"Baggage\" so to speak.\n\nI'm going to say NAH.\n\nYou were right to say he shouldn't be talking like that about her, but I can very much understand why he *is* doing it.\n\nFrom his perspective it's been one bombshell after another, his Ex has Cancer, His ex hid a kid from him, he does the right thing and steps up, his wife wants nothing to do with him anymore,  his Wife is now pregnant with his kid...\n\nI really pity your Brother. I can't imagine what that'd do to my mental state.", "It's unclear if your brother is now the main caretake of Lucy. Does he have sole custody now? (Seems like him taking in and raising his daughter doesn't exactly make him a bad person as implied here \u2014 quite the reverse.) Did his first wife actually die? Why did the first wife leave in the first place? Is the existence or custody of Lucy the only reason the second wife left? What is their co-parenting relationship like? Seems like there's a lot of info missing.", "NAH. His feelings are understandable, but he needs therapy.", "NTA. I have so much empathy for Shannon in this scenario. She was told she couldn\u2019t have children and in the midst of managing that grief, an ex of her husband shows up out of the woodwork with a child for him to take. \n\nShe recognized she wasn\u2019t in a place mentally to take on another woman\u2019s child while managing her grief about not being able to conceive. This also wasn\u2019t a small child that might have readily accepted another/new mom. The child is NINE. So Shannon makes the tough call, removes herself from the scenario and lets Bro take on the mantle of fatherhood without her serving as a source of contention while he builds a healthy relationship with his daughter. \n\nTHEN she finds out she\u2019s pregnant and realizes it still isn\u2019t the right choice to pursue a blended family because that\u2019s not what she wants. She didn\u2019t block bro from access to his son. She just doesn\u2019t want to be in a marriage with him and a parent to his daughter. All of that is mature and means that Lucy has the best chance of a healthier upbringing without a parent that doesn\u2019t want her, or like/love her. Shannon has prevented a wealth of emotional trauma and damage for Lucy and everyone dragging her is a JERK.", "NTA\n\nBut I feel sorry for everyone except that bitch of an ex.\nThat\u2019s why you don\u2019t keep something like that a  secret.

Your brother on the other hand, needs to get over himself and focus on his kids.", "NTA. And neither is Shannon.

Tell your brother that you are on Kai\u2019s side.  It\u2019s the truth.  When parents break up and fail to put aside their anger, the kids pay the price.  The family has been through a lot, but it is time for your brother to realize that his anger hurts his son most of all.", "I don't think you're the a-hole here.  More the log8cal one, where your brother is stuck in the emotion.  His emotion is valid for him, although at some point he needs to heal and move on.", "Nta. \n\nI have an 8 y/o with a former partner and would much rather her have a stepmom that would love her and treat her well instead one who said from the start she wasn't up for it and in turn treated a kid that has no say in the situation poorly.

The universe really does have a twisted sense of humor.", "NTA \nUr being aware of the children and both mothers feelings. Divorce and split families r never \u201chappy\u201d/easy. But you always put the kids first. You\u2019re doing that. They can only be parents if they are mentally okay first. Shannon needs this to be a healthy mama, I\u2019m proud of her. Must be hard", "NTA-I have seen what happens to children raised by step parents who resent them, and it's not pretty. Shannon did the best thing she could for Lucy by removing herself from the situation. Your brother needs to grow up, stop holding onto resentment, and worry about his kids. Perhaps he needs to see a therapist to work through his own issues.", "NTA. Just like there are guys out there that have zero interest in raising someone elses kid, women are allowed to feel the same way. Your brother needs to grow the fuck up and realize that it's over and move on with his life. She doesn't want him it's been years get the fuck over yourself and move on and take care of your kids.", "Your brother is acting like a child - throwing a tantrum and bad mouthing Shannon because she won't do what he wants.", "Ironic that Shannon will probably move on and get into another relationship where she expects someone to parent a child that isn\u2019t theirs and be a step parent when she herself refuses to even accommodate the notion\u2026.. or maybe she\u2019ll say single.", "You are not TA. I think your brother is a bit for the badmouthing because frankly at this point it's just compounding his own anger. He did the right thing and got screwed for it. I don't know about Shannon but she probably did what was best rather than treating a child terribly. I think this is mostly the fault of Emma. \n\n>My brother said I should be on his side and not Shannon's and I'm defending the unforgivable.\n\nI think you mostly just want him to stop.", "He shouldn\u2019t say anything bad about the ex in front of the children, but venting to the sibling is his way of processing everything. Brother is the better human being in this situation. He stepped up to take care of his daughter. His wife left him because she didn\u2019t want to have his bio child since she couldn\u2019t have one. She finds out she is able to have his child, but leaves anyway because she still doesn\u2019t want to help raise a 9 year old that just lost her mother. Shannon is cold and narcissistic. I\u2019d be angry too!", "NTA, she did what she had to do and honestly I commend her for being self aware enough to know that she doesn\u2019t have it in herself to be a stepparent. Had she stayed and treated the child badly I wonder what your brother would have decided.", "NTA. You\u2019re not defending Shannon you\u2019re defending your niece and nephew. Your brother needs to grow up and understand that.", "NTA. You are on his side. He does need to figure out how to move on from his failed marriage and get help if he can't.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you had your brother's back for 2 years. As others have said, Shannon made the right decision for both herself and Lucy and all around considering her feelings about the situation. Your brother had every right to his feelings about the situation as well, and I completely understand his needing to vent in the beginning (as long as it wasn't when his children were around to see/hear the venting). But, now it is time for him to start learning how to deal with his feelings in a more productive way. It's not healthy for him to stay this resentful towards a person that he will be connected to for the rest of his life. Its unfortunate that your realization and confronting of this had to come out in the form of an argument. But, hopefully, once everyone has a chance to calm down, you can help him understand the long term affects this resentment is having on him, you, and most importantly, on his children. Not that he can just instantly go from resentment to forgiveness, it will take time, effort, and maybe some therapy, but the effort will be worth it for the sake of his family.", "Nta, personally even for my own sibling I would wonder why two women would immediately default to preferring to parent their offspring without him.  \n\nHis anger is misdirected.", "NTA - And your brother shouldn't be saying bad things about the mother of his child; that's not good for anyone, but most importantly, it's really unhealthy for the child they share.\n\nBut I do feel REALLY bad for your brother. He got put in a tough spot through what appears to be no fault of his own, and I think everyone should keep that in mind.", "NTA, being on his side IS helping him move on. Life happened, it's gonna keep happening. She doesn't suffer for these feelings he does.", "Share with him some of the awful stepmother posts on Reddit and let him know that is what he would have had if she stayed. Would he really want that for himself and his daughter", "NTA. He's your brother and vented in front of you for years. I'm sure what happened was painful for him, but you're his sister and both care about him and want him to find an emotionally healthy way to move on.\n\nAt some point his venting is an invitation to offer your opinion.", "I would say NTA. Is it upsetting for your brother? Yes, of course. He's allowed to be upset at the events, but your ex-SIL didn't do anything wrong. \n\nBetter to be divorced and find a way to co-parent with one child, than try and raise a child that you resent. Its not the childs fault or Shannon's fault, it just is. That your brother has to pay the price is unfortunate.  That doesn't mean he can go around insulting Shannon behind her back.", "She married a man who she thought had no children. Then all of a sudden a 9 year old appears and it\u2019s her husband\u2019s kid.  She\u2019s allowed to say no. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't describe what you're doing as defending her choices. I think you're trying to suggest different perspectives that might help him deal with an outcome that he can't control and get past some resentful feelings that are clearly poisoning him.", "NTA for defending Shannon. We see too many instances where the step-parent is unwilling/unable to welcome a step-child and then treats them horribly. Your brother\u2019s feelings are his feelings, but at some point he needs to deal with them and stop badmouthing Shannon if wants to have a food relationship with their child.", "I think you're N T A for defending Shannon because she knew she couldn't be a good stepparent to a surprise child so removed herself from the situation, but I mainly vote NAH because your brother is having an awful go at life when his has been turned upside down.\n\nI mean he basically was informed he had a 9 year old child and only learning about it now cause his ex has cancer. She stole 9 years from both him and their child and there's no way to get that back. Of course he doesn't want to lose anymore time and takes his child in, but at the same time loses his wife only later to find they now also have a child.\n\nIt sounds like he needs therapy cause regardless of Shannon leaving being a good thing in the long run for her and the 9 year olds' best interests, your brother has been hurt by two past partners. He's probably struggling a lot and needs a more productive place to vent and work through his feelings like counseling.", "NTA and neither is Shannon. What should she have done? Stayed and been step mother to a child she resented? Your brother does need to find a way to move on, this is a shitty situation and playing the blame game is pointless. If he\u2019s going to be mad at someone it should be the woman who kept his daughter from him", "YTA \nYou could have just said, 'Don't badmouth Shannon around me again'. But no, you explicitly defended her actions against the person who was hurt by them.", "NTA Shannon has a right to her feelings. Your brother is an ass.", "He should really think about it with the roles reversed. Would be really be okay raising a child she had with her ex as their own? Even if he would be okay, clearly she isn't okay with it and it's completely reasonable for her to say she can't do it and raise their kid by co-parenting their son. She shouldn't have to change her mind just because they had a baby.", "Man imagine this story was reversed and the guy left the pregnant woman of his child because he couldn't be a step-dad to her other child. He would have been ripped apart here. Yet it's a woman and it's alllll good now. Your brother must be broken to his very core two woman leaving him and suddenly having two children he can't raise in a normal household, must be hell still NTA tough.", "YTA for not standing by your brother.\n\nShannon's decision to leave your brother during such a pivotal moment in his life is questionable at best. She knew the emotional struggle he was going through upon discovering he had a daughter he never knew about. Instead of standing by him, she chose to abandon the marriage, citing her own emotional limitations. While everyone has the right to their feelings, the timing and manner in which she left makes her a huge AH.\n\nThe argument that it's better for her to leave than to stay and \"treat Lucy badly\" is a cop-out. It assumes that Shannon is incapable of growth or change, and it gives her a free pass to walk away from her responsibilities. If she had concerns about her ability to be a good stepmother, those are issues to work through, perhaps with professional help, rather than grounds for immediate abandonment.\n\nMoreover, Shannon's decision to continue with the divorce even after discovering she was pregnant adds another layer of complexity and, arguably, betrayal to the situation. Your brother likely saw the pregnancy as a new chance for them to come together as a family, yet she still chose to walk away.

A single moment of weakness could ruin their entire lives. Men could sleep with hundreds of women and have dozens of children and never be forced to care for a single one of them.\n\nBut now that technology has advanced it\u2019s changed.

Reddit isn't cs go or dota.", "This is an alt account which I mostly use for travel recommendations, and I give zero shits about earning a flair here lol", "I think you are missing that while she did the right thing realizing who she was, it's still fair to think that she's a shitty person for being that way to begin with. \n\nIt's logical to both think she acted morally because of her inability to be a step mom and that to think very poorly of her for being that way at the same time. \n\nYour brother has a right to feel that way too, and if you don't give him that then you are not at all being fair.", "Why do you have all this empathy for the woman who\u2019s made many people\u2019s lives worse, but none for your brother who was left?", "What about their child?  She's separating their child from their father?  It's better for children to come from a 2 parent home.  And is she gunna stay single forever or is she gunna stay single.  How can she have someone else be a step parent to her kid is she couldn't? That would be very hypocritical.  She's not doing what's best for either kid she's doing what's best for her.  Which brings me back to the other situation. Do you think it's good for a man to be forced to look at the child that is the direct result of her cheating? Nope horrible for his mental health but best for the child.  Same thing here she's doing what's best for only her.", "I love my husband SO much but if his ex came out of the woodwork with a TEN year old for him to raise, that would be a really hard pill to swallow for me. We're not talking about a baby or toddler who would adapt more easily to the new scenario, we're talking about a preteen girl who is likely losing her mother to cancer. Shannon's ENTIRE life at that time would have been mourning the children they can't have, but trying to be okay with being a family of two, to being on the outskirts of a very sudden and potentially hostile \"new\" family that she isn't part of. You can't see how that would be an absolutely fucked scenario to find yourself in?", "It sounds like it's not the complaints but the frequency of them. Everyone has a limit. The issue has moved beyond getting social support from his family- he needs professional help as an outlet because his sibling has expressed that it's getting to be too much with no sign of improvement- that's a reasonable boundary to have.", "your opinion is \u201cstay together for the kids\u201d which is not usually a good idea", "Eh it\u2019s a surprising choice\n\nAdd it to a woman never telling him about his child until she was at her most desperate \n\nYou gotta wonder. It\u2019s the fun of the sub! Lol", "Slandering her how? By saying his was upset about her leaving him? He was talking to his SISTER. Is his sister slandering him now?", "The lie claim is that she did not tell him to put her in foster care. As in. She could have told him she wanted him to not take Lucy and let her go into care, but she didn't.\n\nHe adores Kai. I think he has grown to love Lucy more over time but I don't know that he adores her and I suspect he has questioned or regretted taking her a time or two. He's said some things that allude to that. Especially his comment about Shannon lying because she didn't tell him to put Lucy into care.", "Because she showed no hostility. He has never mentioned any actual hostility either. Just a lot of crying and her saying she could not do it.", "I am beyond shocked that this is a throwaway for you. Truly. /s", "I agree. There are different levels of good and bad. Leaving a marriage because you\u2019re afraid you\u2019ll abuse a child is better than abusing a child, but ideally you would stay and not abuse a child.\n\nIt also, I think speaks to her character that if her husband had abandoned his child she would have happily stayed married to him.\n\nEdited for grammar*", "Its nobody's fault, you seem to be projecting your own hurt. Get over it.", "Who\u2019s many? She only left the brother. She didnt know his daughter so that had no effect on her. So who is this \u201cmany people\u201d you speak of?", "That\u2019s not my opinion but if you know better then even myself\u2026\u2026.", "I get that you are really,\ufffc really on this woman's side, but marriage vows are about more than cheating. They are also about committing to each other through thick and thin, good and bad, come what may.\n\nShe has broken her vows. He didn't.", "You still should support your brother.  That doesn't mean you have to think, or say, that Shannon is an asshole.  But you are not doing the situation any good by taking her side with him.  You'll only succeed in making him feel more isolated and angry.", "Doesn't always have to be abuse. But not being able to love that child or favoring your own can cause issues. If you do not feel you could honestly feel you could make it work then leaving is still for the best.\n\nShe didn't actually say that. My brother was possibly not going to take Lucy. But she was still saying she was done and it was too much for her.", "I\u2019ve never been hurt like this before. It\u2019s possible, I know, however slight that I might just have a different opinion than you? Get over it. Also, telling people \u201cto get over it\u201d is about as emotionally deep as OP, makes sense how you\u2019re supporting them. Emotional constipation often finds its like.", "Then what is your opinion? She should\u2019ve stayed even though she knew she would resent her stepdaughter and probably not be able to treat her as her own? He\u2019s free to talk shit because she didn\u2019t want that?", "Marriage isn\u2019t some binding agreement, at least not anymore thankfully\n\nYou aren\u2019t an asshole for getting divorced", "You should not let someone shit talk someone else when what they are saying is not true\n\nWhat happens if Kai overhears his dad one day?"]}
