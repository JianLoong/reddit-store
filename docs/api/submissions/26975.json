The child in question was 9. My niece was a huge surprise for all of us. The last we knew my brother's ex \"Emma\" was moving for a job and wanted to end the relationship. She only reached out to my brother after all that time because she had cervical cancer and knew she had nobody to take care of their daughter \"Lucy\".\n\nMy brother met former SIL \"Shannon\" a few months after he and his ex broke up. They started dating and got married and had tried for a baby but Shannon was told she could not have a biological child due to PCOS. It broke Shannon's heart and she struggled with the news. It was about five months later that the news of Lucy broke and things spiraled.\n\nA DNA test was carried out and proved my brother was the father. He was uncertain about a place in Lucy's life after all those years of them not knowing each other. But he did step up in the end. Shannon told him she could not stay if he was the father. She could not watch him raise his child with someone else. She could never love his child with someone else and would resent them both when she couldn't have a child.\n\nAfter Shannon left she found out she was pregnant. She was told during the pregnancy that she never should have been told she couldn't have children. That the correct way of saying it would have been that it would be more difficult but certainly not impossible. Shannon was 13 weeks along when she found out she was pregnant. My brother figured that would make her want to try and make things work. But Shannon did not want to be a stepmother and said they should continue to divorce and co-parent their son \"Kai\" who was now 1.\n\nSo all in all it has been almost 2 years since they learned about Lucy and it didn't take long for the DNA results so it's close to two years since the relationship ended.\n\nMy brother went from being upset about Shannon not making it work, to pissed off, and he badmouths Shannon all the time. It got to the point where I grew tired of him saying it and I defended her. I said it was better for her to leave than to stay and treat Lucy badly when she knew she didn't want to raise her. I even asked my brother if he would have stayed had he been in Shannon's shoes. My brother said I should be on his side and not Shannon's and I'm defending the unforgivable.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694868700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k6u5f/aita_for_defending_my_former_sil_and_telling_my/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not everyone wants to be a stepparent. It\u2019s a thankless job where you are doing all the hard work of parenting while constantly being reminded you aren\u2019t the parent and you need to know your place. If she wasn\u2019t up for that job then she did the right thing by leaving. \n\nUnless she knew she was capable of treating his daughter and her son the same, and loving them the same, she would have been in the wrong for going back to your brother. Does he not love his daughter enough to see that? How hard it would have been for the little girl to see her brother grow up with a loving mom while hers was gone?", "my first thought was: wow your brother is fertile..\n\nAnyway, \n\nNTA \n\nHe should NEVER badmouth his child's parent.\n\nEspecially as the only thing she did was not giving him what HE wanted, instead of following her own feelings about the situation.", "NTA - Shannon made a tough decision that burdened your brother, but she protected Lucy just as much as herself. Would your brother prefer an unhappy, resentful household? Oh, wait...", "Brother is TA for badmouthing Shannon as they are still coparenting and that can negatively affect Kai. I can see both perspectives here though. He feels that Shannon should\u2019ve stood by him through thick and thin. He never cheated on Shannon, rather he found out after the fact about Lucy. Shannon did some self reflection and felt that in the long term she wouldn\u2019t be able to control her feelings and didn\u2019t want Lucy to receive any negativity from her that she doesn\u2019t deserve. Lots of feelings involved here.", "NTA", "NTA  \nYou're not TA for trying to explore other people's thoughts.  \nThat being said, your brother's ex(s -- both of them) are HUGE a-holes. If one can't love or care for a child just because it isn't their own, I wouldn't want to be together with them. It's not like your brother cheated on his ex-wife.   \n\n\nSo while I don't think you're an a-hole for just talking about what other people did and why they could've done it, I very much think your brother has a point. What was he supposed to do? Not take care of his own child?  \n\n\nHis ex-wife is a major a-hole.", "I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nI understand Shannon's reason for leaving (I'm childfree myself and would end a relationship so fast if it turned out my partner was a parent, even without their knowledge), thus I understand your need to defend Shannon as she did nothing wrong, but I also understand your brother feeling overwhelmed and betrayed since he's been through a lot.\n\nOkay, well, maybe there's a couple AHs, but it's none of you three. It's Lucy's mom who had a baby with your brother and never told him, then 9 years later show up out of the blue and wants him to step up to the plate to care for her child. Cowardly of her.\n\nAnd the doctor who told Shannon she could never get pregnant is also an AH. Seriously, Shannon should sue whoever that was.", "NTA - tbh it spunds like everyone but you is some level of TA\n\nThe doctor for using a definitive terms and either being clueless or just misinterpreting. \n\nShannon is to a degree as well but i do get both her and your brother were put in awful positions. Especially must have been hard based on timing with doctors input as well. \n\nForget the first mothers name but she is the one who is a complete AH in my books as she ended a relatiinship, still had kid (without your brothers knowledge,) kept it a secret and only let you brother know of kids exostence when she needed help. \n\nYour brother is def an light AH but again im simpathetic to him and shannon both to a large degree as its just a shitty situation for him. But he needs to not routinely disrespect Kai's mom regardless of situation as he gr9ws older kai will pick up on this and it will be a detriment to him. \n\n\nYour right to call out your brother, i would just try to emphasize that you understand its a shitty situation all around.", "I\u2019m on brothers side. I understood the resentment when she coudlnt have her own child, but not after she got pregnant. What\u2019s so wrong with being a stepmother? Now instead of Kai and Lucy having two parents and a stable living situation, they\u2019re going to live in different homes with their parents coparenting and hating each other. The bad mouthing doesn\u2019t make things better but when your other half does you dirty like that? He should be allowed to be angry! As his sister you should be on side. If you\u2019re tired of hearing it then say that. YTA", "ESH, I think you\u2019re right to be tired about your brother\u2019s negativity towards the situation and the sentence \u201cit was better for her to leave than to stay and treat Lucy badly\u201d is the correct outlook. It would not be healthy for one party to stay in a situation they\u2019re unhappy with, and it is not currently healthy for a co-parenting situation for one parent to continually resent the other. That said, you could have tried to have a conversation that was centered on providing understanding on what your brother feeling and trying to get him to achieve a level of forgiveness for his own sake and the wellbeing of the children and not communicating in a way that seems like you\u2019re on your former SIL\u2019s side. You shouldn\u2019t be taking sides, or if you had to take sides, say you\u2019re on the childrens\u2019 side and you want what\u2019s best for your niece and nephew. Maybe you\u2019ve tried that before and it didn\u2019t work ~~in which case he might need a therapist or other outside third party to try to deliver this information to him~~, but if this is the first time you\u2019ve had a conversation on this topic, you went about it the wrong way.\n\nFormer SIL sucks for not having the capacity to love another child (but if she can\u2019t, she can\u2019t, it\u2019s an unfortunate reality everybody has to deal with), your brother MAJORLY sucks for not being able to move on, and you hold the least responsibility in this situation, but if even you feel like you were defending your former SIL (and that\u2019s not just your brother putting words in your mouth), then you went about the conversation the wrong way. Everybody sucks at least a little in this situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Some people can't raise someone else's children as well as they would their own. Not everyone is cut out for it and I personally think it's better to own it and end a relationship than to stay and harm the kids involved.", "Wrong. Not wanting to be a stepparent and removing herself from a stepparent situation doesn\u2019t make his ex an asshole.

They have a kid together and it's been 2 years and he's still badmouthing her.", "Not everyone is cut out for stepparenting. Some are awful and the kids are the ones who suffer because of it. Better to own that in my opinion than to let others suffer.", "Not everyone wants to be a stepparent and that\u2019s ok.
