{"id": 26427, "submission_id": "16cw4pl", "title": "AITA For removing my phone number from all work databases.", "selftext": "Well let me start by letting you all know im not a professional writer so you will likely find several mistakes and I\u2019m ok with that. I (46F) have worked for my current employer for about a year and a half. Without trying to explain a bunch of jargon I\u2019ll just say I work in government databases that require 2-3 step verification when signing in. One of those steps requires me to type in a code that is sent in a text to my personal cell phone. We also have 10 staff members who work in the field and call me, on my personal cell to ask questions, for direction or to give important information. I have never minded this and just considered it a part of making my site run smoothly. The problem started about 4 months ago when another employee (who has since been fired) was caught watching a movie at her desk when she should have been working. The property manager at that time tried to tell us we all need to lock up our phones in little lockers they decided to put it. I immediately refused to lock up my phone as I\u2019m not going to be completely cut off from my phone, working in downtown Chicago. I have called 911 from my cell phone for work related reasons 3 times in the last year. I\u2019m not in the the best area (not the worst either) and it is simply not safe to have my phone not on my person. Fast forward to today and our newly promoted property manager decided one of her first orders of business was to start about the phones again. I explained to her again how my phone is a necessary tool for my job but she stuck to her proclamation and no amount of rebuttal was going to be heard. When I asked her how I\u2019m supposed to access my databases she said, oh you can pull it out for that. Ok how about the guys? How do I reach them? I\u2019m told I can just call them from the office phone and they can do the same to reach me. After trying again to discuss the time loss from making 10 phone calls vs sending a single group text and being told it\u2019s the new policy, learn to work with it I decided to comply. But I\u2019m not playing you can pull it out when it\u2019s convenient for me game and I told her that\u2019s fine but I will not be using my phone for anything. I suggest you reach out the the relevant parties and figure out how we will be authenticating going forward as I no longer have a cell phone to access. She told me again I can use it for that but I declined. I spent a little time removing my cell number from all the databases and ignored my phone all day long. When one of the staff asked why they couldn\u2019t reach me I told them I\u2019m not permitted to use my phone for work anymore and please direct all follow up questions about communication to new manager. So am I the butthead? Am I just being petty or do I let this be my hill to die on? On a side note: I have begun submitting applications to find new employment as I\u2019m already over the reign of new manager.", "created_utc": 1694134433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16cw4pl/aita_for_removing_my_phone_number_from_all_work/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's still 2 factor id when you log in from home though...\n\nBut me and another employee were saying that we shouldn't be doing this at all because we are not issued with work phones.  And there should be a better work around.  We shouldn't have to use our personal mobile for this and we aren't meant to be using them at work.  Many do and there are other legitimate personal reasons to use it ie look some up or use a specific work related app to look something up..  or simply use a calculator app.  But all that is beside the point.  We are not issued with work phones.\n\nIronically the details of how to log in where sent to everyone's work email after it had been set up... except you needed to do the 2 factor thing before you could access your emails.  Someone wasn't very smart there and didn't think that through.\n\nAnd my uni did it about a year ago... my phone was so damn old that it was one of the few models were you couldn't actually set up an authenticator app to get the stupid thing to work.  None of the authenticator apps worked and the phone was so old that no one was going to bother with a work around.  The phone was about 5 years old but worked fine for what I wanted.  And I wasn't going to buy a new phone so I could log into the uni emails.... Ironically this was the final straw that told me that uni wasn't where I was meant to be at the time.
