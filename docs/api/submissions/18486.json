My sister (Jen) my niece (Ann) and my sister's husband (David) all live with me currently, following David falling from a roof and losing his job. My wife and I opened our doors for them during recovery because my sister has always been a SAHM (never once had a job- she's 46) and they were losing their rental due to lack of payment because of the accident. We gave my sister, her kid and her husband our 2 upstairs bedrooms and my wife and I started staying downstairs in our spare room, that is attached to our family/game room. They've only been here for a month and I'm so touched out (so is my wife) that I find myself snapping at every turn. \n\nMy niece Ann has insomnia, on top of being Autistic. My sister will tell Ann to go down in to the family room connected to my wife and i's room to watch TV because Ann keeps the TV way too loud and they don't want her watching TV in her room and keeping up my BIL. This is literally at any time of day/night. Sometimes 2am, sometimes 4pm (when my wife is working). I've spoken to my sister about it several times and the only thing she does is goes down to the family room and tells Ann to quiet the TV down. My wife is also pregnant and 2 seconds from losing her shit and booting these people out on the street. \n\nWell, yesterday my wife felt like shit and went to bed early. Come 1am Ann was down in the family room with the TV on (I was at work). I guess my wife told Ann to get upstairs now and that she wasn't allowed downstairs anymore. She then told my sister that Ann wasn't allowed downstairs anymore and if she caught her down there, they were out. I didn't hear about it at first, so when I got home and found Ann watching TV at 6am in the family room, I originally didn't say anything. But then my wife got up and lost it. I got the story, immediately told Ann to go upstairs and told my sister she had a week to be out. My sister is saying I'm an AH because Ann is Autistic and that's her \"safe place\". I told her that's not my problem and if she wants to argue than she can get out sooner (we have a lease signed by then stating I can kick them out at any given time with no reasoning, so I'm within my rights). My wife is thrilled. My family is pissed though because no one else can help them other than us (all low income or in shelters).", "created_utc": 1685388759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v46nt/aita_for_telling_my_niece_to_go_watch_tv_in_her/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister and BIL are so out of line, and are entitled ungrateful assholes.\n\nThey have no argument, either. How can a room in a house she's only lived for 30 days be Ann's \"safe place\"? Ridiculous. Ann's soothing mechanism might be watching TV loudly, but she has a TV available upstairs in her room. The only reason their parents are sending her downstairs is because they don't want to hear her TV during night time... yet they seem to think it's fine for you and your wife to hear it all night.\n\nStay firm in kicking them out. They've abused your generosity.\n\nIf your BIL can't work he can see about getting disability benefits or similar. And obviously your sister can look for a job. They had a gift in the form of a family member giving them a place to live (and their own floor with rooms for themselves and their daughter separately!) and they completely ruined it for themselves. That's the consequence of their actions. Don't feel bad about it. And prioritize your own growing family.", ">My family is pissed though because no one else can help them other than us (all low income or in shelters).\n\nThen your sister should have taken that into consideration before she crossed the clear boundary that you set for her.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYour sister is entitled - she should get a job. \n\nMaybe I'm offside here, but the simple solution to this problem to me is a pair of noise cancelling headphones for Ann. Weather she's in her room or the games room, seems like it would solve the noise issue toot suite.\n\nUltimately it's your and your wife's home - if you feel as though they've overstayed their welcome then it's your choice.", "NTA. You\u2019ve given your niece her own bedroom, why can\u2019t she watch a volume controlled device in her own room?", "NTA  your home your rules... other family need to either help them or let them in...it kills me when outsiders have alot to say but refuse to help  or if they do help they expect others to help as well... and tell people what to do with their homes and income", "Nta, they keep sending your niece downstairs to watch TV so they can sleep peacefully but disrupt you and your wife's sleep. You've been more then accommodating, giving up your normal bedroom and comfort to make them comfortable and safe. I would be doing everything possible to make y'all life easier while I took over your home.", "\n\nNTA, you were absolutely within your rights to enforce the rules set in place. Your wife has been routinely disrupted and has requested that Ann watch TV upstairs. You also have a legal binding agreement in place. Your niece is Autistic and may need more support to understand the rules that are in place but it is not your responsibility to provide that. It is your sister and her husband\u2019s responsibility to ensure that their daughter follows the rules of the household. You and your wife have already been very generous in opening your house to your sister and her family during this difficult time, and the rules should be upheld.", "Autism isn\u2019t an excuse to have the run of the house.

And not only that, they used their daughter\u2019s autism as an excuse.\n\nThe fact of the matter is your sister would rather disturb your sleep by pawning off your niece to the downstairs tv than solve the problem, which is their daughter suffering from insomnia and watching tv at a high volume.\n\nBut really, I feel for the niece. She\u2019s a victim here.", "NTA. I\u2019d boot them out if they keep walking over you and your wife. Especially since your wife is pregnant.", "It sounds like your sister is making her problem your problem. Rather than dealing with it and being apologetic, she's doubling down. Having autism isn't a do-whatever-you-want-at-any-time-of-day-or-night card. You set your reasonable boundaries. If bluetooth headphones aren't an option due to sensory issues, then another solution needs to be found (by your sister and BIL, not you and your wife). If your sister and her family can't abide by them, then they can seek shelter somewhere else and see how noise complaints get handled by other people.\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's unfortunate that she has Autism. However, the fact that you said she used to watch TV upstairs before this, but they didn't want that much noise to bother them, tells me this has nothing to do with her Autism. Her parent told her to change rooms, and it doesn't seem like it bothered her to do so. She should be able to just as easily adjust to being upstairs. Your sister is an AH for taking advantage of you and your wife.", "NTA so it's not okay for her do watch TV upstairs and keep her dad awake but it's fine to keep their pregnant hostest awake at all hours lol", "NTA. Ann has an entire bedroom upstairs to be her safe space. Your sister is so entitled as to tell her daughter to go disturb you and your wife rather than them. It\u2019s definitely for the best for everyone that you ensure they are no longer staying with you", "Info, any reason why Ann can\u2019t use earphones?", "NTA.  Living together with family is going to be stressful for anyone and now it's been more than a month. You've been more than generous.

I often use this when I am awake and my husband wants to sleep.  The brand I have is Artistic.", "NTA if your family doesn't like your decision tell them to put them up in their house this bull spit that everyone needs to put up with family. Quick story my sister's BF ( sister injured her leg and was awaiting Short term disability)would trample over the rules we set in the house. we warn him 3 days later he walked into the game room and took my PS4 to play at a friends when I flipped told my sister I don't care if you break up but he has a week to get out he didn't even pay rent. She broke up with him herself when he tried to get her to act depressed to make us forgive him and bring him back", "In the meantime...remove the remote control for the TV in the family room, set up PIN access or switch off your router at night.

Your unborn child is more important than your sister!\n\nAnd thirdly, just because your niece is autistic and need a safe space, doesn't mean that she can invade your space whenever her parents think it's okay.

First off that is the worst thing you can do if you have insomnia (I had it), second there are certain chemicals and hormones you need so for you to be wide awake at all hours of the day is just not ok.
