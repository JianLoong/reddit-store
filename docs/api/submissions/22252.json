Around mid May, we were nearing the end of finals week and many students went out to drink and party all day long. I went out with some of my friends to a restaurant, we then decided to go to a couple bars downtown. I was with two of my very close friends both f20. We were all pretty drunk and decided to call it a night after a couple hours. I began to walk my two friends home towards campus. Along the way, one of my friends had to puke. The other friend stated she was okay to walk back home alone as we were near her building. I So that friend walked away while my other friend puked in some bushes. I stayed with her to help her. \n\nAt this point we were on campus and we took a seat at a fountain. 2 cops approached us stating they got a call about someone puking in the bushes and asked for our ID. My friend refused to give her ID and urged me not to give mine as well. I also did not hand mine and watched as she kept asking the cop to let us go. We eventually gave our IDs and she got placed into the car for them to collect info. She was extremely upset after and was very argumentative with the cops. She failed 2 sobriety tests but they didn\u2019t breathalyze her.\n\nAfter this whole thing, she hired a lawyer that her bf personally knew. She was facing either a minor in possession charge or public intoxication. These are so common at our school and are minor offenses that will get taken off your record in 2 years I believe.\n\nShe then had a meeting with someone from the university to discuss this. She gave a personal statement and said that I was the one who was puking from alcohol not her. Although I am 21, this occurred on university grounds so I was angry that she would lie and state that esp before running it by me. When I got upset, she tried to convince me it wasn\u2019t a big deal at all and nothing will happen. I understand that she probably felt scared and I am 21 and am unlikely to face consequences but I am very upset by this. It\u2019s more about the principle because she did not ask me if I would be okay with her saying this. She has a court date as well so I really don\u2019t want that lie announced in that setting. I feel like she is refusing to take consequences for her actions and is being extremely immature about all this. She also tried to say that she did hand her ID right away and was compliant and claimed the police report was inaccurate. \n\nI haven\u2019t talked to her since and am debating on what to do, I think if I voice my feelings she will convince me that it\u2019s not a big deal.

SHE THREW YOU UNDER THE BUS. What kind of friend does that???", "You are NTA. If it's not a big deal, why didn't she fess up? She's afraid of consequences and trying to shift them to you. She is not a friend. DTMF.", "NTA this is a big deal, this going to be on record in a court setting. You need to tell the truth. Do not lie for your friends mistake that will result in legal consequences. She is TA for throwing you under the bus, and clearly not a good friend.", "NTA - NOPE: \"*When I got upset, she tried to convince me it wasn\u2019t a big deal at all and nothing will happen. I understand that she probably felt scared and I am 21 and am unlikely to face consequences\"*\n\nFirst, if it wasn't a big deal why is she spooning it on you and not taking care of it herself.  Classic gaslighting tactic.\n\nSecond, you will face the she does with the same punishment.  You obviously wouldn't get the minor in possession but the public intoxication will stick.\n\nThese are serious offenses that will stick with you on your record.  Sure it's only 2 years of probation but it stays on your record for up to 10 years.  The public intoxication is treated almost like a DUI where in you will have to go to weekly classes and pay fines.  She needs to be held responsible for her actions.  And when she comes at you saying \"please help me out and lie\" respond with \"what's in it for me to take on the burden of the penalties of your actions\"  If she says \"it's what friends do\" reply with \"friends don't ask friends to take this much heat\".  Tell her to stop lying and bringing you into this.  She needs to face the music.", "NTA. If it \"isn't a big deal\" then why lie about it?\n\nYou do NOT want to lie about this in court. I would not talk w/her again. Perhaps you should get some legal advice yourself (most lawers will provide a short free consultation).", "ETA:  NTA.\n I\u2019d be very leery of this.  Any kind of video is going to clearly show it was your friend and what happened.  One thing for her to claim she  remembers things differently with little things but she\u2019s basically saying everything in the cops report is wrong, including the person. The cops are going to be looking to prove they were right with this.  You going along with it is going to put you in a very bad position.  \n\nAny way you look at it your friendship is going to take a hit. Look at your options. 1- You go along with her lie and potentially get into trouble with the law. Which is going to sour it for you.  2- You tell the truth and she gets in trouble. Which is going to sour it for her. 3- this suddenly all works out, nothing comes with it. But now you still have a friend that is willing to lie, in court under oath???  to try and get out of trouble. You\u2019ve got your hands full with that so-called friend.", "NTA. This isn't your friend. Not anymore. She threw you under the bus for something she is gaslighting you not being a big deal. That's not a keeper when it comes to friendships.", "yta... its not a big deal, let it go. Kids will lie and be stupid, you did nothing wrong and continue to do nothing wrong. unless someone wants to pursue anything with you directly.. there is nothing to worry about and you dont have to go out of your way to correct the misinformation.\n\npeople are not stupid, the cops will have noted who was blitzed and most likely puking. She most likely did not do herself any favors by lying.\n\nby coming forward you actually do yourself a diservice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What makes you an AH is drinking with **under-21s**!    \nBy extension, your puking friend is TA for drinking, refusing to give ID, and lying to the police, including charges that, could interfere with your schooling, as drinking on campuses, despite the drinkers age, is not permitted in the USA.   \nlight ESH, but the friend is more of TA", "This is what others have told me, I\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t view it that way.", "Yeah there just seems to be a lack of accountability.", "I really appreciate this response. I did not stop to consider the consequences for me so I guess I was successfully gaslighted. This was so blunt and helpful to read though, I completely agree.", "I really appreciate this perspective! That\u2019s pretty much where I am right now as well. They have not come to me with anything as of right now. However, I plan on being completely honest because I refuse to lie in such a setting.

That\u2019s not what friends do. and if they\u2019ll lie about this, they\u2019ll probably lie about other things too. It\u2019s the energy behind the action- this person does NOT care about OP. At least not enough to treat them decently.", "i agree with everything you are saying... your friend is an idiot and selfish and not a good fruend.

She is expecting for you to perjury yourself I. Court bc there is a chance you could get subpoenaed. Your friend needs to take responsibility for her actions. If she imdidnt act like such a dick to the cops they probably would have let her off.\n\nAlso mainland USA is crazy. In my state, minor in possession of alcohol is just unheard of. A cop would never arrest someone or write a ticket for that. They'd either call a parent to pick u up, drive you home yourself, or release you to a family member/friend who could release you. Cops out here don't have time for such minor shit"]}
