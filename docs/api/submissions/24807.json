My mother, who I have a close relationship with, came over for dinner to see our new place. Everything was going well until my girlfriend excused herself to go to another room. She tried to leave discreetly, but unfortunately, she couldn't make it in time and accidentally farted in front of everyone.\n\nI could tell she was mortified, but before I could say anything or comfort her, my mother chimed in. She called my girlfriend \"disgusting\" and a \"douchebag\", going on to say she needs to \"be a real woman and be ladylike.\" I was in shock. My girlfriend was on the verge of tears.\n\nI asked my mother to apologize, but she doubled down and said she was only saying the truth. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and told her to leave our house. She left, but not before telling me I was being disrespectful to her. Now, she\u2019s upset with me, and my dad and grandpa are saying I overreacted. My grandma is on my side with this.\n\nI believe in treating my girlfriend with respect, and I don\u2019t want anyone in our home who can't do the same. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Thanks for the replies. My gf and I decided to go low contact with my mom for the time being. What my mom did was extremely out of character for her. It was unacceptable and wrong. The reason why I am not going no contact is that my younger brother still lives with her, and he is a minor. \n\nI posted here because I wanted to hear other people\u2019s thoughts about this and see if I overreacted.\n\nI will post another edit soon if it is needed", "created_utc": 1692220893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t2i8h/aita_for_kicking_my_mother_out_of_my_house_after/", "score": 578, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
