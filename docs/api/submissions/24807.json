My mother, who I have a close relationship with, came over for dinner to see our new place. Everything was going well until my girlfriend excused herself to go to another room. She tried to leave discreetly, but unfortunately, she couldn't make it in time and accidentally farted in front of everyone.\n\nI could tell she was mortified, but before I could say anything or comfort her, my mother chimed in. She called my girlfriend \"disgusting\" and a \"douchebag\", going on to say she needs to \"be a real woman and be ladylike.\" I was in shock. My girlfriend was on the verge of tears.\n\nI asked my mother to apologize, but she doubled down and said she was only saying the truth. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore and told her to leave our house. She left, but not before telling me I was being disrespectful to her. Now, she\u2019s upset with me, and my dad and grandpa are saying I overreacted. My grandma is on my side with this.\n\nI believe in treating my girlfriend with respect, and I don\u2019t want anyone in our home who can't do the same. AITA?\n\nEdit 1: Thanks for the replies. My gf and I decided to go low contact with my mom for the time being. What my mom did was extremely out of character for her. It was unacceptable and wrong. The reason why I am not going no contact is that my younger brother still lives with her, and he is a minor. \n\nI posted here because I wanted to hear other people\u2019s thoughts about this and see if I overreacted.\n\nI will post another edit soon if it is needed", "created_utc": 1692220893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15t2i8h/aita_for_kicking_my_mother_out_of_my_house_after/", "score": 153, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That was uncalled for.", "THANK YOU for supporting your girlfriend. You know how many posts I read where one partner leaves the other partner twisting in the wind?

I fucking love this!", "> she was just waiting for it.\n\nYeah that's the sense I got as well. There's no way that someone just comes out guns hot like that unless they're either waiting for the opportunity or have been bottling up something and it just slips through the crack.", "I\u2019ve probably been in healthcare too long but when it comes to gas, better out than in.

Mother mentally/emotionally abused by father and the trauma runs off on ops girl because she is scarred and probably a bit jealous. Then lies about it to feed into dad and grandpa's misogyny, so she can feel in the right.\n\nThis happens alot with women in their 50s and 60s because of how it was in the time they were brought up. Like don't even know I'm abused because every woman is as well. Doing something like ops girl did back when she was young probably would've gotten her a smack or at least berated. \n\nBut the good ol days, am I right /s"]}
