She has briefly spoken to one of my friends before and gotten along very well with her so I knew it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to bring her along since she already gotten along with one of them.\n\nThe plan was my bestfriend would drive to my house and then spend the night at my place after the party.\n\nWe get to my friends house and everyone is super welcoming to her. She on the other hand is being distant, quiet, and just coming off as rude. Now I understand some people are just not as outgoing as others but my friends were very welcoming and friendly to her. She sat in one place the whole time and would ask for food and drinks. My friends were also shocked by her behavior since she did speak to one of them over the phone before and over the phone she was very outgoing and kind. I was very embarrassed since I spoke so highly of her just for her to act the complete opposite.\n\nAfter spending some time at my friends house we decided to go out to a local bar strip. There was a little bit of a line at the bars but nothing to crazy. While we were waiting on line she told me that her boyfriend was coming to pick her up and that she was going to go out with him and his friends. I was very upset by this but was sort of relieved since she wasn\u2019t nice to my friends anyway. She did not even say bye to anyone. She got in her boyfriends car and left. \n\nAfter having a great time with my friends at the bar I went home. My best friend started blowing up my phone around 2AM asking if I were home since all her things were at my house. I ignored all her calls and texts. I made sure I locked all the doors and windows in my house to make sure she couldn\u2019t get in even if she tried. I saw her boyfriends car pull up in my driveway and turned off all my lights and laid in bed while listening to them knock at the door. She started texting me telling me her keys are in my house along with her clothes and other belongings. \n\nI turned off my phoned and went to bed. I  was so upset how she came across to my friends and how she embarrassed me so I decided to get back at her.

You're an AH.", "YTA- she met one person\u2026 not a group of people. I\u2019m personally better in more smaller settings than a group. Clearly they were welcoming but that doesn\u2019t mean it eased her comfort. \n\nThat\u2019s messed up to not give her stuff back. Are you sure she\u2019s even your best friend?

Your friend went to a party where she didn\u2019t know anybody, was quiet and shy, and later decided to leave the bar hopping and have her boyfriend pick her up. You decided to punish her by not letting her have her possessions back? I don\u2019t get it.", "YTA. You didn't list ages but this sounds like you all are early 20s because this is the immature crap you pull at this age. She felt uncomfortable at the party and with that group of people so she bounced to go hang with her boyfriend. You got upset so decided to punish her. You both suck, and communicate for s\\*it,  but you're the AH because you locked her out of your home and ignored her calls and kept her from her keys and stuff. WTF? That's dumb and petty and just so unnecessary.  Are you a child? Give her her keys. Let her go home!", "YTA, I don't the ESH or NTA comments at ALL. \n\n> She on the other hand is being distant, quiet, and just coming off as rude. \n\nDid you talk to her privately and ask if everything's ok?

You're an absolutely shitty friend.", "YTA. maybe she was just feeling shy, uncomfortable or overwhelmed. Even if she was just being rude, If you have an issue with someone especially a FRIEND, you use your words about it, not hold their personal belongings hostage. Grow up. You are not a nice friend.", "YTA. Maybe she had a bad day. Maybe she just isn't as comfortable talking to people in person as she in on the phone. Whatever the reason is, she's still your best friend right? It's surprising how you can't accept this and think she 'embarrassed' you. And even if she left the party mid-way, if you were awake, you could have given her her belongings back. What if there was an emergency? You can't keep someone's belongings at your house because you're upset and don't know how to talk to someone. You should've communicated your problems with her instead. Definitely the AH, OP.", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nLet me get this straight. She didn't act in a way you liked while hanging out in a group, not thinking that maybe she has some social anxiety or something, or just didn't like one or more of your friends. She takes off and in retaliation for...not sure exactly...you lock her out knowing full well her house keys are in there? Then lay in bed pretending to be asleep while you listen to them hammer on the door, ignoring them? \r  \n\r  \nYou need to get over yourself and grow up.

That was needlessly mean.", "Yes, YTA, you are petty (not the kind of petty I like) and mean and an awful friend. Good riddance for your friend if she never talks to you ever again. If your other friends are anything like you, I can see why your best friend wouldn't speak to them.", "YTA. Grow up.", "YTA, quiet does not equal being rude. It could have been for a ton of different reasons.", "YTA definitely. If you don't like how she acted around your other friends, be civil and talk to her about it. You didn't have to lock her out of your house and refuse to let her get her stuff. I'm kind of relieved she was with her boyfriend. Do you think you'd act the same way if she were alone and didn't have anyone with her at night?", "YTA. It would have been so easy to give her belongings back. That's being vindictive.", "YTA. Yeah it sounds like she was being rude but it also sounds like something was wrong. Did you ask her what was going on or just assume that she was being a b for no reason? But regardless of how rude she was you can't just take her stuff hostage and take back the offer to stay the night without saying anything to her. Like if she was planning to stay overnight she probably had important stuff like medicine, contact lenses, etc. You chose to be petty instead of communicating with your supposed \"best friend.\"", "YTA you should have spoken to your friend before deciding to ghost them because you were upset. You acted very immature. Why didn't you explain to your friend you were upset with them and didn't want them to stay over anymore and let them take their things with them?", "YTA 1000%\n\nInstead of seeing if your friend was ok or trying to bring her out of her shell, you left her in a corner at a party and judged her. There are two sides to a story and you didn\u2019t even bother getting hers.\n\nThen, instead of just sticking her stuff by the door so she could grab it, you acted so petty and childish. It\u2019s not like you were even asleep- you just got revenge when in reality, you were the shitty friend.", "She was clearly uncomfortable being surrounded by people she didn't know. Also her keys were at your house but you refused to let her get them. Where was she supposed to go? YTA", "YTA, that was definitely not the best way to get back at her, that was just immature. Not a good way of getting back at someone, I think you should've just talked with her instead of just locking her things up.", "YTA. please please please ask your friend how she was feeling or if something was up. Perhaps she left for a reason, perhaps she was feeling uncomfortable or some reason else. If nothing came up and she just felt like being rude to everyone.. ESH because it was very rude either way to ignore your friend when you had everything, even her keys, at your house. You should have let her in, talked to her about the situation and tried to come with a mutual understanding.", "INFO: How old are you?", "I don't know why you had to ask, but yes YTA. An eye for an eye never works. All you proved to your friend is that she was right treating you as an asshole before. Grow up and start talking to people, even if they are difficult conversations.", "YTA\n\nOk, she was rude. And later explained she had anxiety. Even though you didn't know that at the time, you also made zero effort to see if she was alright. She was acted out of character and you didn't consider anything could be wrong? And to make matters worse you didn't let her get her stuff even though you were home and awake so it would've cost you nothing.\n\nAsshole and horrible friend.", "She sounds like she was uncomfortable at the party. You sound judgmental AF. You could have stayed by her side to help ease her into all the other people.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t bad enough you deliberately ignored her when she was trying to get her stuff? You\u2019re a terrible friend, and nothing she did warranted your reaction \n\nI would guess you\u2019re in the 18-24 range?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You guys stopped being \u201cbest friends\u201d years ago about time you both realized that.", "INFO: did you at any point in the evening ask her if anything was wrong, that she didn't seem herself, if she needed to talk?", "YTA I get you were upset by her behaviour to your other friend group, but that is NO excuse to hold her items hostage.", "YTA\u2026 some \u2018best friend\u2019 you are.", "YTA\n\nCome on seriously? Being quiet and shy at party comes across to you as rude?! The way you talk about her and they way you treated her afterwards when all she wanted was HER stuff back makes you sound like a bad friend", "ESH. Your friend was an AH to your friends, she sucks for that, but holding her stuff hostage was unnecessary and petty of you. It would have been plenty reasonable not to let her stay the night with you after her behavior, but you should have at least handed over her things when she showed up outside.", "ESH. Yes she was TA, but that doesn't mean you don't let her get her keys.  Be glad she didn't call the police to get her property back.", "YTA\n\nThis is why I stopped having girl friends in my early 20s.

She bailed and basically stopped being an annoying factor in your night.

I feel like at get togethers it is very common to have snacks, at the very least, and so she didn\u2019t think anything of it. Also, for people with social anxiety eating is a real mechanism to feel included without having to talk to others. It\u2019s like the people who go to clubs and smash drinks cause they wouldn\u2019t be able to talk any other way to strangers. Also, punishment did not nearly fit the crime.

Everyone at the party didn\u2019t know majority of the people so everyone was socializing and getting to know everyone. She was the only one who did not speak to not one person.

She probably try to meet your friends despite her anxiety to please you because you are her best friend but then had a hard time and decided to leave without bothering you. If she is your best friend and as you said yourself you talked about her in so much good ways to your other friends there must be a reason ?! If you really understand her anxiety then you must know that be overwhelmed is different than being rude. You should have tried to talk to her, and explained to your other friends that she is a really good person but can be anxious in society and she not meant to be rude. \nAnyway nothing about what she did justify the fact that you lock her out without her keys, it could have turned wrong if she have had an accident or whatever.

I doubt she was asking to be let in so she and her boyfriend could stay.  She wanted to get her things so she could go HOME.

Girl bye. Her sitting by herself means you left her, you invited her then left her for other friends. I\u2019m sure her BF didn\u2019t leave her stranded to try to talk to other guys alone in a corner. Then you left her stranded all night unable to go to her own house.

We get there, she immediately goes and sits in a dark corner leaving me alone in the crowd. She refused to interact with anyone and refused to even stay together like we agreed prior to the party (we had this agreement for safety reasons mostly). The party got broken up pretty quick and soon as we step foot back on campus, she immediately ditched me for a different friend. For context, my university isn\u2019t in a great area and it can be pretty dangerous to walk alone at night.

Doesn\u2019t excuse OP\u2019s actions but OP\u2019s friend was TA from start.", "But what does that even have to do with the situation? You didn't like her behavior so you punish her by holding her house keys and other stuff hostage? Where was she supposed to go? And all because you thought she was being rude?", "I wonder why\u2026", "Eh I\u2019ll take it", "I disagree but even if that were true , the friend being rude at the party doesn\u2019t mean you get to keep someone\u2019s important belongings hostage. You shouldn\u2019t be looking to \u2018punish\u2019 friends in the first place but that \u2018punishment\u2019 so to say doesn\u2019t fit the crime. The friends actions in no way make ops actions acceptable, understandable or excusable. So she\u2019s still TA.", "That's not what you said in the post. \n\n\"My best friend started blowing up my phone around 2AM asking if I were home since all her things were at my house.\"\n\"She started texting me telling me her keys are in my house along with her clothes and other belongings.\"\n\nYou're just making up excuses for your bad behavior now. Her boyfriend took her to his house because you locked her out of her own house (and car?) because you stole her fucking keys!", "OP should have given her friend her thing and told her to leave. Keeping things that don't belong to to you is THEFT.", "It really wasn\u2019t deserved.  You\u2019re objectively worse than your (ex-) best friend.  You took her behavior personally and went total scorched earth on her.\n\nI say again: grow ALL THE WAY up.", "No YTA, there was no excuse for *your* behaviour. Turning the lights off and hiding because she removed herself from a situation that made her uncomfortable? What are you 10? Grow up. You should have just given her her keys and talked to her like an adult, aired out your concerns and if it came to it you don\u2019t invite her next time. You ain\u2019t justified, you\u2019re just an AH.", " Because what you did to her was bordering if not illegal? \n\n\nI would be calling the damn cops on you for trying to STEAL my belongings. Trying to call that \u201cnot nice\u201d when in fact it was crazy level retaliation lmao.", "Anyone who doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re TA here is emotionally immature and cruel. I truly don\u2019t understand how you think this is ok. But hey OP, I hope someday your BF takes you out of town and locks you out of the room/house over some petty BS. It\u2019s not wrong according to you. Think of all the fun bums and thugs you\u2019ll meet being on the streets with them with nowhere else to go. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be ok.", "The goal was never to be mature. I had petty intentions from the start. You make it seem like I took her out of town and locked her out. She left with her bf then tried to come back to sleep at my house.", "Is this her normal behavior? Clearly, something was wrong at that party, whether it be something that happened beforehand or your friends said/did something to make her uncomfortable. \n\nBeing a good friend means to stick by each other even when you don't like what they are doing. If she was being rude, you should have pulled her aside and asked her what's going on. You should have supported her. It seems like instead, you brought someone around a group of people they didn't know, and left her to figure out what to do by herself, while you were off, comfortably hanging out with the other people. \n\nIt's like when you bring an SO to meet your family. You don't walk through the door and ditch them to go do your own thing while they talk with people they have never met. You hang out for a minute to make sure they are comfortable with their surroundings. \n\nAlso, her fucking house keys were in your house. How was she supposed to go home? That is a pathetic thing to do to anyone... especially someone you call a friend.", "You need help. I\u2019d have called the police on you. You really really need help. But again hope your boyfriend takes you on a trip and you get into a petty argument and he locks you out on the streets. That really is the kindest thing I can say to you. You need a new perspective.", "If you had petty intentions from the start, YTA, obviously. Why are you even asking this subReddit?", "Ok so A) this is my first time bringing her around my friends so I didn\u2019t know she would act like this. I am also her only friend. She use to have a lot of friends but idk what happened.\n\nB) even though I didn\u2019t mention it, I never talked ill of her after she left with her bf. When my friends asked where she went i told them she wasn\u2019t feeling well. \n\nC) I did pull her aside and she said she was tired and hungry. I then tended to her all night brining her food and energy drinks while she complained that she wanted \u201creal food\u201d\n\nD) she didn\u2019t come to get her things. She came to go to sleep bc her bf didn\u2019t want to drive her back in the morning", "I wouldn\u2019t blame my boyfriend for locking me out if I were rude to him", "You really should have put all this in the post. It sounds like she has some mental issues to work through. Her anxiety might be a lot worse than you think. If you really want to be her friend, you can't 'retaliate' when she does something you don't like. You were awake. You could have let her in. You could have talked to her and helped her. Doing what's right can be inconvenient but this situation could have been solved in such better ways.", "Get a grip, for someone's sake", "I didn\u2019t want to go into detail really because I didn\u2019t want to shit on her character but I see that by not including some things people are getting the wrong impression of me."]}
