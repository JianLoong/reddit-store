The child won\u2019t remember him anyway, good to catch it early and let her figure out the real dad.", "NTA.  You really should learn not to share marriage issues with everyone.  Have conversations with your spouse and leave your families out of it.", "NTA but wondering why now seemed to be a good time to try and have a kid when he hadn\u2019t even sorted out the first kid.", "Sounds like you and the child are the only ones here who are NTA. Your husband, and more so his ex, have brought this situation about due to their infidelity and lies.", "NTA. You\u2019re right there\u2019s too much unnecessary drama and you\u2019re not the one taking the opportunity for the little kid to have a father, he has a father and the mom is the one denying him a parent. She was already doing that with your husband even before the paternity.\n\nIs best if he moves on, maybe send some help/gifts here and there if his heart tells him to do so but not as a responsibility.", "NTA. The little boy has a dad.  It's up to the kid's mom to tell the actual bio-dad that he's a father.  She wants to be civil and coparent now because the other guy is worse.", "The post does start out with saying he cheated on her while she was pregnant, so I wouldn't give him too much sympathy.", "This, the boy views your husband as his dad and your husband views the boy as his son. If he still wants to have a relationship with him, that should 100% be up to your husband.", "I wouldn\u2019t think a guy is loyal if he cheated on his gf while preggo. He\u2019ll most likely drop the kid like a hot potato if he ever have his own bio kid, but right now he\u2019s just kid envy cause he\u2019ll most likely not for the rest of his life.", "I kinda thought that at first, but the fact that she\u2019s done such a 180, I think it was a power play to always keep him in her life.  Now that she doesn\u2019t hold that card anymore, there\u2019s nothing to stop him from cutting her out completely.", "Well bf didn\u2019t know that ex had cheated so why would he have done a paternity test? \n\n\nAnd if you\u2019re talking about the sperm test, well ex had gotten pregnant, so why would he need to get one?", ">He has at least a year of legal battle ahead in the courts.\n\nHe wasn't on the birth certificate. There is no need for a legal battle", "Wait, why does op suck?", "To be fair, he barely ever saw the child and probably never devvelopped a relationship with him. \n\n And seeing as he's not the dad, why on earth would they put themselves through 15 years of dealing with that woman??", ">Your husband is the only father he has ever known.\n\nHe saw the kid a half an hour here and there. I seriously doubt the kid even remembers him.", "So how is op's fault that the kid isn't his?? She was right to push for a paternity test. \n\n>his name would have been on the birth certificate.\n\nAnd he should thank his lucky stars he wasn't otherwise he would've been on the hook for child support for a kid that's not his.", ">Not to your husband, but to an unknown kid. Perhaps unintentionally, you just described a really decent man in his intent.\n\nHonestly, we need more women telling men that it's OK and that they don't have to keep lighting themselves on fire to keep people who are unworthy warm. \n\nHe has absolutely 0 logical reasons to stay in this kids life besides some weird societal pressure that says if you were ever a parental figure in another man's kid's life you have to sacrifice everything for the rest of your life. It's not natural at all for men to feel this way about children that aren't theirs and especially ones they were tricked into caring about.", "What relationship? And it's not his kid.", "He's 3 and barely saw op's husband. I doubt he would remember him in 3 months.", "It also just seems rather cold to me to even try to have another child when he has such a poor relationship with his first one. I just get the ick feeling from everyone here.", ">If i found out one of my kids wasn\u2019t mine biologically, it would change nothing about my relationship with them.\n\nYou've probably spent more than an hour or two every week around them. This dude doesn't even know this child.", ">If i found out one of my kids wasn\u2019t mine biologically, it would change nothing about my relationship with them.\n\nI assume your kids grew up with you and you weren't forced out of their lives? \n\n>At no point do you mention what is best for this poor kid\n\nCause it's not her responsibility.", "He thinks of the child as his son, and he wants to remain in his life.", "Why? It's not his son. Another comment made a good point. He probably hasn't even spent a single full day with this kid.", "It's not his kid. And BM is a nightmare to deal with.", "It absolutely is her business. Resources spent supporting another man's kid who has no relation to anyone in the relationship should be spent on their actual family.", ">This is ugly and going to get uglier.\n\nNot for op and husband. They don't have to deal with it anymore. \n\n>eventually she will contact the bio dad for cild support\n\nShe should do that then.", "Because child support is paid to the custodial parent, not the child. For obvious reasons. Mom could start fucking around with the cash and he'd legally still have to contribute.\n\nSupport your kid, if that's how you see him, but it's better to do it on your own terms, not a judge's.", "He was a child months before. I'm gonna give him the sympathy.", "Does he though? With as little contact as they're allowed, I don't think it's likely that the 3 year old has any idea who op's husband is.", "Agreed, too fast, too soon, but I gotta say I respect OP for connecting dots and helping put all the facts on the table. She came in hot, but I kinda don't expect anything less from folks their age. Such a messy situation, but I think op is doing good drawing boundaries and looking out.", "Also get your husband therapy cause damn 18 and 28, and now that.", "Do so but get him therapy too he hasn't stopped being her victim in the past 6 years he has a lot to unpack", "Sure, that\u2019s the bit you let play out and allow him to come to that conclusion on his own. A decision that might sting him later emotionally. Now if he feels that sting, OP will get the blame. Sometimes it\u2019s better to let things run their course.", "I\u2019m sure you took that into consideration when providing your own judgement.", "Because they don't want to take care of a child that isn't either of theirs? This is ridiculous.", "They don\u2019t have an actual family nor will they ever from the sound of it. This kid was a fixture before she existed in his life and for all intents and purposes is his kid now.", "Can you say it a little louder for those in the back?\n\nWhat the fuck does court-ordered child-support have to do wirh actually supporting the child, you can directly support the child through gifts/clothes/take them back to school shopping.\n\n\n\nCourt-ordered child-support means he is supporting his ex, AND THEM HIS EX SUPPORRS THE CHILD, Which he doesn't want , he wants to support the child.", "TBH, that \u2018relationship\u2019 sounds very\u2026 questionable at the least. It\u2019s not unheard of for people in toxic situations to cheat as a means of escape. Not okay at all, ofc, but considerably more understandable than other situations. So it\u2019s possible that this was the situation here.", "that\u2019s fucked", "By \"that\" you mean actual facts??", "A relationship was formed regardless the kids doesn\u2019t know any different. The op partner did want to continue a relationship but was talked out of it.", "Absolutely not. It's not his kid in any way, form, or fashion. This is ridiculous. \n\nHe has low sperm count. Not no sperm count. Trial and error will eventually have one of those few swimmers make it across the finish line. \n\nMaybe saving money for fertility treatments would be better than wasting it on a child that no one in the relationship has relation with?", "SUPPORT THE KID, NOT THE EX. DIRECT AID. BUY THE THINGS THEY NEED.", "He was a teenager who was groomed by an adult woman, as much as we can trash on cheaters, remember that OP's husband was barely legal and having his first relationship experience with an abusive and manipulative cheater who CONTINUED those lies for 3+ years.", "I\u2019m not here to debate you, walnut. \u201cI doubt he would remember him,\u201d ain\u2019t actual facts either, do you know how complex memory actually is? Even in children? Pretending small children can\u2019t experience trauma from things like losing a parental figure regardless of age, is naive at best and willfully blind at worst. I made MY judgement based on MY opinions, you can make your own.", "The kid is young enough that they won't even remember him. He wanted to basically harm himself to keep other people happy by continuing to interact with a toxic ex that does nothing but lie. \n\nI'm glad OP stopped this strange form of self-harm some men do by taking other men's kids as their own with no reward.", "Ooh la la.\n\nOnly good nt???\n\nOnly good human left on this god-forsaken rock more like it.", "Considering the baby is not his - she was cheating too", "I find 18 and 28 way worse than \u201cicky\u201d.", "Dude. His pregnant girlfriend was a predator. Like what do you want from him? He was 21 in a relationship with a 31 year old grown adult and about to have a child. That's an insane amount of stress for someone who is barely an adult. 21 IS SO YOUNG and he was actively being taken advantage of. He was 18 when they got together and she was his FIRST. Do you even comprehend how gross that is? Yeah, he did something wrong, but good Lord look at the context and have some grace!", "Not to say btw it is acceptable or that I'd feel the same if she were the same age as him, but this scenario is just simply not the place for \"two wrongs don't make a right\". A lot of wrongs were happening to him and he acted out.", "There is always drinking \ud83c\udf7a"]}
