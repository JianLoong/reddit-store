She has the option if she wants or needs support to go after the legit father of the child. And seeing that she is 10 years older than your partner there was definitely a power imbalance there which she ran with.  Now she\u2019s trying to back peddle. I suspect she knew he wasn\u2019t the father which is why she refused to put his name n the birth certificate and just tried to use the child to manipulate and control her ex. That\u2019s something that won\u2019t magically disappear out of your relationship if your partner stays part of the child\u2019s life. (Baby trap?) \n3. While not ideal, your partner may be the only father figure that child will have in their life and may be the closest he has to being a father.  Not to sound cruel but infertility issues are brutal and unless you look at medical intervention you and him may not be able to conceive. Plus if he does stay involved a very clear legal document would need to be created as the ex could decide down the road to completely cut him out of the child\u2019s life IF she finds a new partner or what not. \n\nI feel for the child, but the overall situation is crappy no matter how you look at it.", "NTA for everything except trying to convince your boyfriend not to see a child both he and the child view as his son. \n\nThis will destroy your relationship.

But forever together is a long time, and driving a wedge between him and the child he cares about (maybe the closest thing to an actual child of his own he\u2019ll ever have) really increases the chances of him growing to seriously resent you further down the line.

She continued to take advantage of that after the relationship by using the child as the tool to manipulate him.  She liked the younger man chasing after her which is why she refused visits to his home, would only allow an hour or two.  She got off on him missing classes, leaving you behind, and coming to her.  Yes she used the child as the reason, but the child is incosequential to her.  The child is just a pawn in her games.  Now that the truth is known she, and she has lost her tool, now she wants to co-parent with your husband who is not a parent to the child, to keep the game going any way she can.  I have no doubt she knows who the real father is, and he is probably active in that child's life which is why she only allows 1-2 hour visits so your husband doesn't find out.\n\nNTA because now he knows the truth, and can move on.
