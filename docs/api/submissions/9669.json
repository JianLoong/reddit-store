You\u2019re literally harassing her. \n\nThere\u2019s two possible explanations. One is that she ordered for two, the other is that she ordered enough for herself to eat for multiple days. \n\nUnless you want to sneak through her phone or attempt to demand security footage from the hotel\u2026you have no proof of the former, and must assume the latter.\n\nAlso, why do you care?

Short of calling her a liar when you don\u2019t really have any evidence, I don\u2019t see what else you can do. Is it really worth it? I could see her complaining to HR that you are hassling her about her eating habits when she stayed within the per diem amount.", "YTA. She\u2019s within the per diem, let it go for crying out loud.

Or she wanted two desserts but only at half of each and threw the rest out.  There is also the possibility that this is for two meals but for one person just not at the same time.  It's because it's under the per diem that perhaps giving her the benefit of the doubt may be a good idea.  But pointing out that this looks like it's for two people.\n\nWhat will happen next time will be the most expensive items to get it to the per diem and lots of sides even if they only take one mouthful!\n\nPerhaps you just give a certain amount regardless of what is bought... then no one works out how many they are buying for and questions it.  The it doesn't matter if you chose to spend that money at the supermarket and more bang for your buck, or you go to the most expensive restaurant and only buy one thing.\n\nAll you are doing is micromanaging someone and leads to suspicion which is not a good work culture.  You think it's going to save money but you'll find people start doing what they can to cost you the maximum.", "YTA. It's under the per diem, and she says it was just for herself. It's overstepping at that point as everyone can eat different amount (my sister can easily eat an entire large pizza and still be hungry), or maybe she just wanted to try a bunch of different food, sides, toppings whatever since it wasn't on her dime.

Asking multiple times while clearly implying you believe the employee is lying? YTA.

I can\u2019t say either way. I\u2019ve had to travel for work when I\u2019ve been super broke and when I got free food I would get enough to live off of for days. At one point when I was in Paris for two days I literally lived off a baguette, a wedge of cheese, and salami. I was pretty poor then and was at the thinnest I\u2019ve ever been. So she could have just be trying to get by. And if she\u2019s a really obese person or binge eats she probably could have eaten a lot of that herself.
