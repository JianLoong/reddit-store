Short of calling her a liar when you don\u2019t really have any evidence, I don\u2019t see what else you can do. Is it really worth it? I could see her complaining to HR that you are hassling her about her eating habits when she stayed within the per diem amount.", "YTA. She\u2019s within the per diem, let it go for crying out loud.

It's because it's under the per diem that perhaps giving her the benefit of the doubt may be a good idea.

The it doesn't matter if you chose to spend that money at the supermarket and more bang for your buck, or you go to the most expensive restaurant and only buy one thing.\n\nAll you are doing is micromanaging someone and leads to suspicion which is not a good work culture.  You think it's going to save money but you'll find people start doing what they can to cost you the maximum.", "YTA. It's under the per diem, and she says it was just for herself. It's overstepping at that point as everyone can eat different amount (my sister can easily eat an entire large pizza and still be hungry), or maybe she just wanted to try a bunch of different food, sides, toppings whatever since it wasn't on her dime.

I can\u2019t say either way. I\u2019ve had to travel for work when I\u2019ve been super broke and when I got free food I would get enough to live off of for days. At one point when I was in Paris for two days I literally lived off a baguette, a wedge of cheese, and salami. I was pretty poor then and was at the thinnest I\u2019ve ever been. So she could have just be trying to get by. And if she\u2019s a really obese person or binge eats she probably could have eaten a lot of that herself.

That she cares so much about the company that she\u2019s willing to eat leftovers or that is a meal for two people? \n\nMake it make sense.", "...this sub is literally about commenters commenting on how they feel about OPs actions.", "Excellent points. \ud83d\ude42", "^THIS. \n\nI don't get why people are justifying harassment over food. Not like the traveller sent the company a bill for a million dollars. \n\nLiterally spent the money they were *permitted* to spend. \"OP should check. OP should check.\" Yes. They should hire a PI to go investigate these claims. /s\n\nAlso a little r/antiwork but it is Ok to do the minimum if it means you and the employee are in the clear without putting your or the employee's job in jeopardy.", "The op enquired. It was answered. \n\nMan, ordering a double deal is exactly the sort of thing I would do. I like having smaller snack meals, both healthy and unhealthy, available over the course of a day. I'd see ordering a good deal as a win -win. They get a lower per diem, since I don't use it as much the second day, and I get snacks on hand so I can just eat at the desk. \n\nYTA.", "I understand OP has a job to do, asking them once is fine. OP asked and was told it was just for 1 person. Job done, send it through.\n\nOP however kept harassing them, calling them a liar, hence they are the asshole.", "How do you know the person wasn\u2019t a picky eater and ordered different toppings and sides so they could just eat the bits they felt like when it came or that they liked after trying it?\n\nPeople like OP remind me of all the stories we see on malicious compliance where companies screw themselves over with too strict policies such as not allowing first class travel, even if the 2nd class seats available cost more or will make the travel time longer, meaning the staff member gets paid more travel time and in the end the company spends more on wages for the increased travel time then they saved forcing 2nd class over 1st.", "How is the nutritional value of the food relevant to the company, though?", "Source that she's going on a fast food bender and not just buying a few meals for lunch\\dinner\\multiple days?  She's under the per diem.  \n\nThe funny thing is, if OP WAS GAMING THE SYSTEM and going to the most expensive place to eat and always ordering just enough to go under the per diem, you and OP would be perfectly fine with it, but even though OP is actually SPENDING LESS MONEY THEN SHE IS ALLOWED TO, OP wants to.... what?  I'm not quite certain what the end goal is here.  Make the business traveler ONLY EAT AT EXPENSIVE RESTAURANTS 3 TIMES A DAY so finances won't hassle her?  \n\n\nI'm reminded of the story where OP made a business journey bypassing tolls, but a penny pinching boss told them they'd only pay for the SHORTEST way, so OP started using the shortest way with expensive tolls, and wound up costing the company more money.  This sort of stuff is always penny wise, pound foolish, because any idiot knows how to game things so the company pays the most.  And if you make it so that they always have to make the company pay the most in order to not be questioned, they'll do so.", "My grandad could have eaten it in one go", "If you are actually working on a business trip, especially long hours, then it's not unheard of to spend the time ACTUALLY WORKING and not have time to go out and eat.  I've done 12-14 hours per day on business trips, with nothing to eat but the continental breakfast in the morning.  Technically I had a per diem, but not enough time to actually use it.  And you bet you bum that I made certain to have lots of midnight snacks and leftovers in my hotel room to deal with those 12-14 hour days, especially since I was away from home and didn't have my fully stocked fridge, or knew what restaurants were open 24 hours around me on the trip!  \n\nIMO, this is so very very very strange to me, you trust an employee to go on a trip, to probably deal with very expensive stuff (In my case, fix $100,000 machines), but think this employee is so... immature that she shouldn't be in charge of how she eats her meals?", "Whats more likely is that these business trips are usually tightly scheduled, not leaving room to eat 3 meals a day. Ive ordered pizza to keep in the fridge to grab a quick slice if im hungry and dont have time to go grab a real meal.", "Anyone who feels a sense of responsibility re their employer's money, as opposed to fulfilling the minimum requirement to follow the rules and no further, is a moron.", "You are wrong here.\n\nOp should not just be sending it through and tbh I think he has been too nice by asking multiple times\n\nIve worked in various finance roles and I have qualifications with strict ethical requirements and guidelines. I\u2019m not compromising myself to help someone else to commit fraud.\n\nI\u2019d ask once nicely, maybe follow up giving them an out with something like, \u201care you sure you didn\u2019t forget to take someone else\u2019s food off the bill as it looks like two of everything\u201d, and after that I\u2019m forwarding it to my fraud department.\n\nOP is not the asshole and is actually being too nice. He needs to report them and move on though, not keep asking or giving them more chances.", "She's not within the guidelines, that's the point. The guidelines state, per op, only 1 person can be fed. No sharing on one per diem. A normal person would make the likely assumption that at least 2 people, possibly more, were fed here. Thankfully, my company allows bill splitting and alcohol.", "Oh COME ON NOW.\n\nBe realistic.", "Right, THAT is definitely more likely. Who\u2019s never ordered a set of pizzas, wings and desserts to eat cold as a quick snack when you\u2019re spending money that isn\u2019t your own?", "What will happen, is that because the company is trying to nickel & dime them about meals that didn't exceed their per diem, the staff will instead decide that it's all too hard to deal with the company's dumb questions and will instead make sure to get meals that are obviously for 1, but which also max out their per diem.\n\nWhen a company makes your life hard, you lose any care about saving that company any money.\n\nOP will harass this staff member, maybe get the reimbursement cancelled this time and in return, the company will pay max per diem every meal from here on in.\n\nPaying dollars to save cents", "The state office I worked for doesn\u2019t allow this. The state stopped paying for receipts because employees were submitting bogus receipts for exorbitant amounts.  Or employees really were eating the most expensive because the state was paying for it.\nThe state finally went to per diem to save money and time.", "Assumption, meaning no proof yet", "Having a per diem cap but still nitpicking is bs anyway.\n\nI'd order 3 pizza in three different flavors, eat 2 slices each. Hey, that's under the per diem. Any policy that says I must finish my food?\n\nPenny pinching policy would just end up with people dgaf and maxing out purely out of spite."]}
