Your sister and husband can collect tithes, daddy can work overtime and mommy can can get on the donor list.  They will be fine without pulling you in, only to dump you when you are no longer useful.", "NTA. That's pretty obvious. You are only their child when they need something. You owe them nothing. They cut you off. Now they have to live with the consequences. Why doesn't one of their church friends pony up the cash at least? They might be able to find a match too. Oh, wait. I forgot. Those kinds of bigots never actually help anyone, even one of their own.", "NTA.  I am sorry that your biological egg donor treated you so poorly when you were younger and now would like to get something from you. Just because the woman gave birth to you does not make her your mother nor someone that you need to do anything for. \n\nIf you put aside the $$ component which is not an insignificant amount, the risks for giving a kidney are also nothing to scoff at.  \n\nI mean if you wanted to be snarky you could tell them that while you are not in a position to either lend them money nor donate a kidney that you will be happy to pray for them and then continue going no contact.", "NTA. She put you in an ex-gay torture camp then disowned you. Normally I am in favor of forgiving people, but this is a purely transactional request on her part. If she didn\u2019t think you had money (and maybe a donor kidney) she still wouldn\u2019t be talking to you. There are potential risks to donors, as well as the fact that you only have one kidney and no spare after donating it. It is worth the risk for someone you love who is very important to you. She doesn\u2019t fit that category.", "My the sisters husband can ask the church to sponsor the money and pray for a kidney to grow \ud83d\ude44", "NTA, sounds like karma came around", "NTA tell them that bisexuality comes from the kidneys. Because I\u2019m messy and want to know what would happen.\n\nOr send them some beef kidneys.", "Absolutely not. If you have children, you love them no matter what, unless your religion is something that forbids the LGBTQ+ community like Muslims, you don't send them to a camp. That does nothing but tear your relationship, Also, you don't spit in your child's face and say such horrible words because they don't want to live the ay the way you want them to. Your NTAH, you're the saint in this situation.", "NTA\n\nTell her your bisexual kidney isn't compatible with her bigotry, so you're not a match. Sorry not sorry", ">I'm a terrible human being for not helping her out, and that I should be ashamed of myself.\n\nSo what you're saying is their opinion of you hasn't changed at all. NTA.", "NTA - Tell her you don\u2019t want to get in the way of her faith, and she needs to pray harder and wait for her god\u2019s answer.", "Tell your mother not to worry, \u201cGod will provide!\u201d \ud83d\ude02 NTA", "NTA You should ask her if she's tried praying her kidney failure away, and why it's not working.", "NTA\n\nTell ur sis since she and others think OP so terrible person maybe they should stop contacting and asking help frm terrible ppl. Why do they even need a kidney frm terrible person, tell them ur kidney is also terrible, why do they need so terrible kidney.", "Milton Green Milton Green Milton Green Milton Green Milton Green", "NTA.  She made her bed, so now she can lie in it.", "You are not a suitable candidate for donation, perhaps someone in her very supportive church would, of course, be a willing donor.", "Nta tell them this is God's will. Who are you to interfere", "If god wants her to have a kidney he can miracle her one.", "They just want your money and a kidney.  Tell them to get bent. Nta", "NTA, tell them she's reaping what she sowed, that's a biblical reference, who knows if they'll get it.", "NTA. To be cruel and petty if they keep contacting you tell them that it's time for your mother to get right with God. Then block, block, block. You're a useful physical bank now because your mom wants to scrap you for body parts and cash.", "NTA. There's no hate like Christian love. They are the worst kind of people and I'm so sorry you had to grow up with sociopaths, hiding behind their belief to condone their abuse. \n\nKeep your kidney, and if you have the money go take a vacation with your wife and send them the pictures.", "NTA.   You can tell them all that their God works in mysterious ways.  She rejected you and now she needs you.  Maybe her God is trying to teach her something.", "Nta. They have a hell of an interesting bar for \"horrible person\", and I'll echo the other folks that \"not her daughter\" is a hard sell starting place to ask for cash and a kidney. Also, don't know if they also cover conversion camps, but s/troubledteens might be a good place for you to look for support from those who have also been shunted off to Camp Hell.", ">but made an effort to reach out to them and invite them to my wedding \n\nWhy?", "NTA. But I do think less of you for not going no contact with Faith too.", "NTA.\n\nWhy are you even posting here, this one's easy. You're not her daughter, she said as much herself, and she doesn't want you contacting her for as long as she lives. \n\nTo me, that just sounds like an invitation to annoy her in the afterlife with seances filled with nonsense and reminders that she's definitely not in heaven. That's just me though.\n\nAs for Faith, we'll, she and her husband have a church. They can pray.", "NTA\n\nBut honestly, it is almost comical at this point how awful they are. You went no contact and they break that only to tell you how awful you are and, \u201cCan I get one of your internal organs with a side of cold hard cash to go?\u201d Could they be any more narcissistic? These people are the very definition of evil. I\u2019m so sorry.", "NTA. F them all. You don\u2019t owe them the time of day. Give them nothing and continue doing you. That is way too much entitlement for one family.", "NTA!!!!!! They are so wrong, it's not even funny.  I can't even imagine what you went through.  You have no requirement to help.", "NTA. You\u2019re not her daughter apparently. She put you through hell for so long. You don\u2019t owe her anything. If you want to donate your kidney and money fine.  If you don\u2019t that\u2019s also fine. Good luck and enjoy your life!", "NTA. You reap what you sow. Mom fucked around and found out. You owe her shit. Good on you OP.", "NTA\n\nShe said you are no longer her daughter and I'm guessing you where NC with pretty much everyone who is now trying to call you out so they had joined her decision to remove you from the family.\n\nThey made that decision, they can go on with the concequences.", "NTA. I wouldn't give this woman a piece of gum let alone a kidney AND money. Tell her to kick rocks.", "NTA, go to the doctor and tell them you are being coerced into testing so they can say you are not a match. Absolutely don't give this woman anything.", "I will never understand older relatives contacting younger people asking for \"spare parts\". To me it sounds like \"hey, I've lived much longer but please give up your good health so I can have a few more years just because I'm that egocentrical.\"\n\nI would never expect my children to sacrifice for me. I would however do anything for them."]}
