And you're treating her as a burden when she asks for help navigating systems she isn't familiar with and that operate in a language she cannot speak? \n\nDude. Moving to a new country is a huge challenge. Learning a new language as an adult is a huge challenge. Doing both simultaneously would be insurmountable for many people. Since you know the system, you know the language, and you are her *wife*, you should help her navigate these things. You should *not* be expecting her to slot right into a wholly unfamiliar situation, and treating her like a leech when she cannot. \n\nI understand being frustrated, especially with needing to help parents as well, but what she is asking is not unreasonable. If you want her to regain her independence, you should help her find a foothold so she can actually get settled in and start working towards that. Help her get her business set up, navigate the legal system, and find a good class for learning the language. She's made a massive and terrifying change for the sake of your relationship, the least you can do is support her while she adjusts.", "YTA.... Dude she's been there for a month, of course she's not gonna know the language or how your countries government works. \n\nWhen you ask someone to move to a different country for you it's your responsibility to ensure they are as well established as possible.\n\nI get it that you have a lot of things going on but step back and prioritize them.

You are delusional if you think it's easy to just adapt to a completely new system. Your poor wife. Do you even care about her wellbeing? Do you even like her? Why do you want her to struggle instead of helping her and dealing with these issues 10x faster and easier for everyone? Also, learning a new language to a level which allows you to deal with legal paperwork is NOT the same as being conversational. Your wife moved expecting a partner and instead is dealing with an unhelpful roommate. She's right - you ARE helping your family but not her.

You've moved to a new country and expected your wife to learn a new language in a relatively short time.  You are also expecting her to figure out the country's system for registering for things while being unable to understand the language.

It\u2019s only been a month and you want her to be fluent? That\u2019s unrealistic. It takes people much longer to figure out the Tube. You wanted her in your home country.

Enjoy the divorce!", "What was the situation where you were married but not living together in your country?\n\nWhy are your parents - who presumably have lived in this country their whole lives - more \"deserving\" of constant help than your wife, who has lived in this country for less than two months?\n\nWhy is your fatigue at choosing to help your parents more valid than your wife's fatigue at being forced to acclimate to a brand-new country whose language, systems, and social structure she is not familiar with?\n\nYTA.", "You\u2019re not just an asshole, you\u2019re a narcissistic monster and horrible partner. She should leave you.", "YTA for not seeing things from her perspective. \n\nKeep in mind your wife gave up her entire life for you. She\u2019s in a new country (YOURs) with a language she doesn\u2019t know,  different culture, new business to start , probably isn\u2019t making any money or know anyone. Doesn\u2019t matter if you talked about moving to your country for years. Adjusting is easier said than done. Stuff like making a bank account may be basic for you, because this is your country you\u2019ve lived in your whole life. For foreigners, it\u2019s not. Had it been you that moved to her foreign country, I think you\u2019d be struggling just as much as she is, especially with learning a new language. It\u2019s not something you just pickup.

Yta", "YTA for a number of reasons, 1 its not easy for adults to learn a new language if they have only ever spoken one. 2 she just moved to a new country where she possibly doesn't know anyone, doesn't speak the language, and probably feels really alone since it seems a lot of your time is being taken up by this other legal problem. 3 THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE but as someone who's wife seems inexplicably incapable of many things I see as normal adult tasks it took a long time to realize that some people were not raised to be independent and thus are not. Independence isn't like a swimming lesson from the past... you don't just push someone into the deep end and expect them to do well.", "YTA - she moved to a totally new country and doesn\u2019t speak the language. She uprooted her whole life and is trying to get settled in a new world. You\u2019re frustrated after 1 month? \n\nMaybe you should see if you could move to a foreign country where you don\u2019t speak the language and get your affairs in order in less than a month. \n\nIf you were having this conversation 2 years from now that would be one thing, but one month???", "YTA. Massively. Your expectations are insane. You moved her to a new country and expect that she not only be fluent concersationnaly within a month, but that she be fluent in complex language, independent with your government and legal procedures, and need nothing from you in the way of transitional support. You're prioritizing your parents over her and being quite cruel to treat her like an inconvenience when she has changed her life and everything she knows for you.", "YTA massively. \n\nI moved across the US to be with my BF after several years of long distance. Even in the same country with the same language, it\u2019s been difficult. I left my family and my job of 10 years and it\u2019s been a rough adjustment. If he had ever acted like me asking for some help and understanding was a burden I would have moved my ass back across the country.", "It doesn't really sound like you were worth all this trouble of moving COUNTRIES.

Do you really need Reddit to tell you that? She just moved to a new country where she doesn\u2019t speak the language and you expect her to be immediately independent?!

It's been a month. This isn't so much about whether she's capable of doing these things, but about whether she feels supported and cared for in an incredibly stressful time. She is trying to figure out if she will have a life here and if you will adjust to make space for her. It sounds like you're telegraphing that she won't and you won't.", "God forbid your wife should be a tiny bit dependent upon you. How could a new country and a new language cause someone to need assistance.", "Upvote", "Why in 5 years has she not tried harder to learn the language?  Why did she not prepare for this move to which she agreed in advance!   I moved to a foreign county when I was 20. First thing I did was sign up for language classes.  Your wife needs to learn the language.  She can\u2019t expect you to do it all for her forever.  \nNTA", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell her to grow up or go back home. Find a partner that is grown up, and not a spoilt child.", "I do feel you....I'm was in the same situation where my wife moved to my country and that came with a lot of bureaucratic shit that I never had to deal with before (way more than expected) + my parents also had a big issue that they had no one else but me to help out at the time. But I'll withhold my judgement for now until more info comes to light in the comments.", "I'm gonna say ESH.  It's true that you're being incredibly harsh and cruel to someone who just uprooted their whole lives for your sake but......you did mention that the two of you talked about moving 5 years in advance. Did she really not do any prep work at all whatsoever in that meantime? If I was considering moving to a foreign country, I'd at least have learned enough to be passable beforehand.", "ESH. Help your wife. The only reason i am not giving a y t a is because I think both you and your wife should have thought about this before moving, what did you think was going to happen. Language gap is a huge problem in day to day. \n\nCan you find a course for her and practice with her at home?", "NTA.\nWhile I understand it's difficult to move, it is also your wife's responsibility to figure out where she needs to get help and go get it. She's been with you for 5 years, now. She knew that she was going to be relocating there, and made very little effort to learn to communicate. I made more of an effort for a three month stay in Japan, and I wasn't going there to start a life with a spouse. Yes, you should help your significant other. But, it goes both ways. She needs to also be helping herself and not relying solely on you.", "If I were in her position, I'd go back home. I would not be very happy about my HUSBAND being too busy helping his parents to help me  in a new country where I don't yet speak the language.\n\nYta if that wasn't clear", "I would have been and am more than happy to help her with taxes based on the knowledge I have, but I struggle with her needing help for even basics - surely opening a bank account doesn't need me to chaperone her?", "This.  I've got to be honest - if I moved to a country that had an entirely different way of doing things than I was accustomed to for a partner who treated my \"how do I survive here?\" questions like some big burden, I'd be moving my happy ass back to where I came from in a hurry.", "Apparently asking him to translate is the equivalent of relying on him the entire relationship", "Wife has also been here for a month according to his post. My parents moved with us to another country. It took almost 4 months for them to get everything set up: bank account, apartment, buying a car, getting jobs, driver\u2019s license, and other legal documents, school registration. And they spoke the language. It\u2019s alot of work especially when you don\u2019t know how things work in that country and don\u2019t speak the language. We had to get family members that lived in the country to help us with a lot of it. Especially getting an apartment and a car. My parents didn\u2019t have enough credit history to get those things without a co-signer. We lived with family until we could get all this stuff done.", "nah fam; as someone who has moved to a foreign country where I didn't speak the language doing things like getting a SIM card etc were all easily doable thanks to the internet and kind strangers. OP can be doing both but it honestly sounds like she's not taking initiative as a person of able body and sound mind while OP is dealing with family issues she should be \\*more\\* independent and self-reliant not less.", "I understand the move is hard, but I also think that she's not appreciative of the help that I'm already giving her, which is what is frustrating to me.", "Awww you just warmed my heart. That is so kind.\n\nWish op would do the same for his WIFE.", "Lol, good point. I\u2019ve done for colleagues moving to my country with a smile on my face than OP is doing for his wife.", "My thought was Sweden but yep, Germany sounds fair too \ud83d\ude02", "The wife does need to learn the language, and should have taken steps to do so before moving, but she has only been there for a month! That's not asking OP to do it \"forever\". If my husband had had to move to a whole new country where things were harder and he didn't know the language, I absolutely would have helped him for as long as he needed. For me, this is an ESH, but OP sucks worse.", "I went through a similar situation with my ex wife, when she moved from Africa to the UK, although she could speak English\n\nI'd say OP is AH for now, only because she has just come over and as a foreigner things can be difficult learning everything from scratch.\n\nHowever if 1 year later there has been no progress or plans put in place to learn the language, etc, then wife would be AH\n\nI did everything initially for my ex. Opening a bank account, sim card, paperwork so that she would be able to get a job, even trying to arrange driving lessons.", "INFO: Do you mind sharing what your country and your wife's original country are?", "She does not know the language. Are you being deliberately obtuse here? \n\nI don\u2019t want to be rude, but you genuinely do not sound like a good partner.", "You admitted yourself it's much more complicated in your country than hers. Not to mention it's probably in a language she doesn't understand.", "If she doesn't speak the language? Yeah. You said things are different than she's used to so maybe she's worried she'll be asked something she doesn't understand or a question she doesn't know the answer to or for a document she doesn't have or someone trying to take advantage of her or steal from her or something. Did she know exactly which bank and type of account she was best for her needs, what the fees were, what the deposit & use requirements were?", "Wow, you are clueless. I'm well educated and moved from the US to Canada, both English-speaking countries. I spent the first year confused by banking, car insurance, medical stuff and more. Help your wife!", "No, not you, maybe someone who likes her though.", "What you describe is the bare minimum of being a husband. She doesn\u2019t speak the language and she made an enormous sacrifice for you. \n\nEven the worst assholes can reciprocate .000001% of what they take. You\u2019re whining about doing even that much.", "Omg. Opening a bank account is not that simple. There are lots of terms and conditions set forth that you should understand before opening the account. And each country, state, heck even bank will have its own minutia. If you don\u2019t speak the language fluently enough to have these kinds of conversations or to understand the terms and conditions, then absolute you should get help. I did this in China and it was so stressful (and I have been learning the la until for 10 years by that point) Have a little empathy that what\u2019s easy for you is extremely difficult and frustrating to her. It\u2019s like learning how to walk and function in society again. YTA.", "Tell us what country you\u2019re in. Do people in your country/region of your country dislike \u2018foreigners\u2019? What\u2019s your country\u2019s treatment of women like.\n\nBecause in my country I\u2019ve always received better service and faster results when my father has accompanied me then when I went with my mother or by myself. \n\nYou\u2019re her partner. She shouldn\u2019t need to grovel to get you to help her, and then worship you if you do. You should do it without being asked. \n\nYou should have made a list of things she would need to establish herself in your country and scheduled time to do it with her.", "Do the people at the bank speak her language? If not how do you expect her to open a bank account? Sign language? Pointing? You\u2019re being deliberately obtuse.", "I used to work at a bank.  Yes.  Yes she needs you there.", "Be nice to your wife!\n\nQuit giving her a performance review and actually help her. \n\nYes. She needs your help with opening an account. Filling out all forms. Making social and culturally informed decisions. And more. \n\nCome on yo. You\u2019ve got a real chance to shine here, and you\u2019re spending all that time just dimming her light. Yta.\n\nETA removal of dude, and bro-> yo.", "Depending on the country it can. I'm guessing they have some kind of KYC form she has to fill out and some places I've lived you get denied if  you don't put the correct language. One place I lived I got denied twice till I paid someone and literally it was a few words difference based on terminology, so using a translator app was causing issues.", "Depending on the language, it can take someone years to become conversationally good at it, never mind having to use it in a professional sense. YTA and I hope your wife moves back to her home country.", "You\u2019re acting condescending and resentful of the few things you\u2019ve helped her out with, but you\u2019re mad that she isn\u2019t grateful enough? YTA.", "My school district has special people to help native-born citizens enroll their kids. Stuff like that isn\u2019t easy even if you are born in the country, speak the language, and understand the culture. \n\nThis is all big, confusing, in a different language, and just totally different from everything she\u2019s known. It makes every single thing harder because it\u2019s *all* new and piled on top of all the other new things. Not one thing is easy or comfortable. Not one thing is something she\u2019s done before in that way and if she doesn\u2019t speak the language there\u2019s no way for her to know if she\u2019s even getting accurate information. She will need significant help, maybe daily for a very long time. \n\nYTA.", "Goodness, I hate it when someone proves that gay relationships can be just as toxic as straight ones. You make us all look bad over here. You brought this poor woman to your country knowing her language skills weren\u2019t strong and now you\u2019re responsible to help her. Opening a bank account is hugely intimidating in a foreign language. Heck it\u2019s intimidating in a native one. The contract requires legal and financial terminology that isn\u2019t always clear to the average person who already speaks that language never mind someone who knows very little. And then at the end of the day you\u2019re supposed to give these people your MONEY?!? Of course she wants your help. Break up with her and let her go home if you\u2019re going to be this cruel.", "My husband has been in the US for 5 years, and even has a Master's that he got here that was taught completely in English, and he still needs help figuring out some systems. And it's not always as easy as googling it, if you don't know what the right term is. There is not always a correct 1 to 1 translation for government or banking services. Of course she's having issues, especially if she's coming from a Latin American country and have 2 last names, it's a nightmare. And she's only been here a month. Lady you don't know how difficult it is to sign up for anything in any country if you aren't a citizen, I'm pretty sure bureaucracy sucks everywhere unless you've got gobs of cash to cut through it all. It took forever for my husband to just get a credit card because he just didn't have credit, and the bank had a hard time finding him cause he's got 2 last names. And I'm busy and have my own life, but of course I help him, because he left his family and support system to stay with me. You need to readjust your time tables cause whatever you can do will take her at least twice as long, that's just how it goes, especially in the beginning.", "isn\u2019t op a woman", "You said she's depressed.  Yet all you care about is yourself..", "She moved to an entirely different country for you. She's doing a huge amount of emotional, physical, and intellectual labor to be with you. \n\nHave you shown her the appropriate level of appreciation for all she's done for you and your relationship?", "She moved for you, to a country she can\u2019t even speak the language because she loves you and you won\u2019t even help her get settled in?

The good thing is that everyone speaks English so language isn\u2019t a problem. Everything else\u2026 is. In my case it was quicker to learn basic language than open a bank account.", "LOL it's so weird that I simply shared my own similar situation and got downvoted a lot, but you did the same and got upvoted. Reddit folk are weird.", "But I mean she\u2019s been there whole MONTH. What could be left to learn?!?\n\nIt took me more than a month to adjust to the differences in how things are done when I moved STATES.", "*wife", "OP is also a woman.", "I got depressed when I moved two hours away in the same state! I can\u2019t imagine how she\u2019s feeling being in a new country where she doesn\u2019t speak or read the language!
