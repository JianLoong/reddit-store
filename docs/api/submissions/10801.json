And you're treating her as a burden when she asks for help navigating systems she isn't familiar with and that operate in a language she cannot speak? \n\nDude. Moving to a new country is a huge challenge. Learning a new language as an adult is a huge challenge. Doing both simultaneously would be insurmountable for many people. Since you know the system, you know the language, and you are her *wife*, you should help her navigate these things. You should *not* be expecting her to slot right into a wholly unfamiliar situation, and treating her like a leech when she cannot. \n\nI understand being frustrated, especially with needing to help parents as well, but what she is asking is not unreasonable. If you want her to regain her independence, you should help her find a foothold so she can actually get settled in and start working towards that. Help her get her business set up, navigate the legal system, and find a good class for learning the language. She's made a massive and terrifying change for the sake of your relationship, the least you can do is support her while she adjusts.", "YTA.... Dude she's been there for a month, of course she's not gonna know the language or how your countries government works. \n\nWhen you ask someone to move to a different country for you it's your responsibility to ensure they are as well established as possible.\n\nI get it that you have a lot of things going on but step back and prioritize them.

You are delusional if you think it's easy to just adapt to a completely new system. Your poor wife. Do you even care about her wellbeing? Do you even like her? Why do you want her to struggle instead of helping her and dealing with these issues 10x faster and easier for everyone? Also, learning a new language to a level which allows you to deal with legal paperwork is NOT the same as being conversational. Your wife moved expecting a partner and instead is dealing with an unhelpful roommate. She's right - you ARE helping your family but not her.

You've moved to a new country and expected your wife to learn a new language in a relatively short time.  You are also expecting her to figure out the country's system for registering for things while being unable to understand the language.

It\u2019s only been a month and you want her to be fluent? That\u2019s unrealistic. It takes people much longer to figure out the Tube. You wanted her in your home country.

Enjoy the divorce!", "What was the situation where you were married but not living together in your country?\n\nWhy are your parents - who presumably have lived in this country their whole lives - more \"deserving\" of constant help than your wife, who has lived in this country for less than two months?\n\nWhy is your fatigue at choosing to help your parents more valid than your wife's fatigue at being forced to acclimate to a brand-new country whose language, systems, and social structure she is not familiar with?\n\nYTA.", "You\u2019re not just an asshole, you\u2019re a narcissistic monster and horrible partner. She should leave you.", "YTA for not seeing things from her perspective. \n\nKeep in mind your wife gave up her entire life for you. She\u2019s in a new country (YOURs) with a language she doesn\u2019t know,  different culture, new business to start , probably isn\u2019t making any money or know anyone. Doesn\u2019t matter if you talked about moving to your country for years. Adjusting is easier said than done. Stuff like making a bank account may be basic for you, because this is your country you\u2019ve lived in your whole life. For foreigners, it\u2019s not. Had it been you that moved to her foreign country, I think you\u2019d be struggling just as much as she is, especially with learning a new language. It\u2019s not something you just pickup.

Yta", "YTA for a number of reasons, 1 its not easy for adults to learn a new language if they have only ever spoken one. 2 she just moved to a new country where she possibly doesn't know anyone, doesn't speak the language, and probably feels really alone since it seems a lot of your time is being taken up by this other legal problem. 3 THIS MAY NOT BE THE CASE but as someone who's wife seems inexplicably incapable of many things I see as normal adult tasks it took a long time to realize that some people were not raised to be independent and thus are not. Independence isn't like a swimming lesson from the past... you don't just push someone into the deep end and expect them to do well.", "YTA - she moved to a totally new country and doesn\u2019t speak the language. She uprooted her whole life and is trying to get settled in a new world. You\u2019re frustrated after 1 month? \n\nMaybe you should see if you could move to a foreign country where you don\u2019t speak the language and get your affairs in order in less than a month. \n\nIf you were having this conversation 2 years from now that would be one thing, but one month???", "YTA. Massively. Your expectations are insane. You moved her to a new country and expect that she not only be fluent concersationnaly within a month, but that she be fluent in complex language, independent with your government and legal procedures, and need nothing from you in the way of transitional support. You're prioritizing your parents over her and being quite cruel to treat her like an inconvenience when she has changed her life and everything she knows for you.", "YTA massively. \n\nI moved across the US to be with my BF after several years of long distance. Even in the same country with the same language, it\u2019s been difficult. I left my family and my job of 10 years and it\u2019s been a rough adjustment. If he had ever acted like me asking for some help and understanding was a burden I would have moved my ass back across the country.", "It doesn't really sound like you were worth all this trouble of moving COUNTRIES.

Do you really need Reddit to tell you that? She just moved to a new country where she doesn\u2019t speak the language and you expect her to be immediately independent?!

She doesn't understand the system and doesn't have a lifetime growing up in that system. You do. \n\nThis is beyond language fluency issues. Yes, she needs to work on language skills, but honestly, fluency comes from immersion. You can learn in classes all you want, but there is a point where you have to *use it* to learn it and gain fluency. \n\nBeyond that though, are *systems*, ways of doing things, that vary dramatically from country to country. As a US citizen, if I moved to Canada, I would have a HUGE learning curve, despite knowing the language(s). If I *didn't* know the language, it would be that much more disorienting! There are things in each country that you are expected to just *know*, and if you don't, there can be huge consequences. That's why she needs your help.\n\nThese adjustments are going to take time. You need to be patient. As for getting her business operational right away, I suggest you hire a consultant to get her set up, hopefully one that is bi-lingual. The difference in time to start will probably be worth the fee.
