Anne used to call me cursed and the spawn of Satan. (Our family was very religious at the time so it was considered very offensive)\n\nThis was a few weeks ago, but I've been feeling guilty. The day before this happened, she was diagnosed with infertility. This was a big heartbreak for her. \n\nThe day of, I was going out to my best friend's wedding. My sister was babysitting my 2 twins, let's call them Ava and Adam, for overnight. I couldn't have just left them alone because there were some people reported missing that week. She showed up when she was supposed to. When I came home the next day, Ava and Adam were passed out on the couch with octonauts playing on the TV. Anne came in a few minutes later. She had left around 9 pm, I came home at 11 am. She was going out to party but forgot to come back home and had a hangover at her friend's house. When she got there I cursed her out and yelled, \"Im happy that your infertile, because you dont deserve to have kids.\" After I was done, I slammed the door and locked her out. She began crying outside for around 5 minutes before driving off. My family is on her side because \"Its not her fault your kids are cursed. \". The rest of the day was dedicated to help clean up the mess around the house\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: My children are 13, and after that day I apologized profusely to her but she blocked me on all platforms. Also, she was the one who volunteered herself to babysit. I asked my aunt, and then Anne butted in saying, \"I can do it!\"\n\nEdit 2: I have cut all contact with them after they threatened to come to my house and unlock all my doors so they can \"get rid of these cursed children.\".

Yeah she could have said no which is shitty but too many families have the ideal that when you\u2019re related you have to watch their kids like no.", "> So there's good people and bad people in every group\n\nYes, but some groups are categories, not organizations. Being an atheist isn't something you choose, it's something you are, it's certainly something you're born as. and while I'm sure there are \"atheist organizations\", you are not obligated to join one.\n\na religion is an organization. it has a leader, it has rules, it has a membership. you choose to be a member, and are free to choose to cease being a member.\n\nthe actions of an individual who happens to be in a category \"group\" you are also in... do not reflect on you. if you're bald, nobody can say you're a bad person because some other bald person committed a crime.\n\nBut when you are a member of a group you have chosen to join and choose to remain a member of, the actions of other members of that organization DO represent you. You are giving tacit support to the actions of its members by choosing to remain a member. \n\n\"If there's a Nazi at the table with 10 other people sitting there talking to him, then you have a table with 11 Nazis.\"", "I can see my Aunt doing this and she's not religious just fucked up.

Your wrath toward your sister is justified and is the right attitude to have for the safety of your kids. Your sister deserves this wrath and you are owed a severe apology from your sister. I wouldn't hold my breath on an apology from your parents, they sound incredibly toxic and I wouldn't even suggest being in contact with them as a life rule. You can't have a healthy relationship with people who think you and your children are cursed based on (checks notes) a physical birth defect.

I\u2019m childfree and I like to drink a good bit, but I could never fathom doing that while watching children even if they are young teenagers. She is way more in the wrong in this situation and you had every right to freak out. Also the \u201ccursed\u201d thing?

The Pope is really religious but that doesn't make him responsible for the beliefs and actions of Scientologists. Scientologists aren't connected to illegal Israeli settlers in Palestine.

Yet the members of those religions refuse to abandon the fold and follow their beliefs without the evil structure of humans it rests upon."]}
