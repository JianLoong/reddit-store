Anne used to call me cursed and the spawn of Satan. (Our family was very religious at the time so it was considered very offensive)\n\nThis was a few weeks ago, but I've been feeling guilty. The day before this happened, she was diagnosed with infertility. This was a big heartbreak for her. \n\nThe day of, I was going out to my best friend's wedding. My sister was babysitting my 2 twins, let's call them Ava and Adam, for overnight. I couldn't have just left them alone because there were some people reported missing that week. She showed up when she was supposed to. When I came home the next day, Ava and Adam were passed out on the couch with octonauts playing on the TV. Anne came in a few minutes later. She had left around 9 pm, I came home at 11 am. She was going out to party but forgot to come back home and had a hangover at her friend's house. When she got there I cursed her out and yelled, \"Im happy that your infertile, because you dont deserve to have kids.\" After I was done, I slammed the door and locked her out. She began crying outside for around 5 minutes before driving off. My family is on her side because \"Its not her fault your kids are cursed. \". The rest of the day was dedicated to help clean up the mess around the house\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: My children are 13, and after that day I apologized profusely to her but she blocked me on all platforms. Also, she was the one who volunteered herself to babysit. I asked my aunt, and then Anne butted in saying, \"I can do it!\"\n\nEdit 2: I have cut all contact with them after they threatened to come to my house and unlock all my doors so they can \"get rid of these cursed children.\".

They told her they cannot understand her sexuality. But they didn't need to understand someone to be good neighbours, nor to offer their charity.\n\nThey're strong believers in their own actions and the actions of others being what will, or will not, get them where they need to be in the afterlife. They'll offer guidance *if requested* but otherwise try to let people be what they are.\n\nThe family of the lesbian girl though are everything wrong with religion.

This isn\u2019t a simple YTA or NTA. \n\nYour babies were entrusted in your sisters hands and she left, that is fucked up and absolutely makes her the AH. Even at 13 if you wanted someone there to watch your kids, that person shouldn\u2019t have left. \n\nNow onto your comments. Infertility is a really sensitive subject, it\u2019s got a pain and anxiety and frustration that really can\u2019t be described unless you\u2019re in it. To be clear your infertility is not an excuse to act like an asshole, but it is also not something ANYONE should throw back at you. Ever. Period. You had every right to be angry with her, yell at her and be mad at her, but to say you\u2019re happy she\u2019s infertile and doesn\u2019t deserve kids, that makes you softly the AH. It\u2019s good you tried to apologize, I think your sister owes you one as well. Just know the impact of those words were probably incredibly heavy because she most likely thinks those things daily. I blame myself daily that I must be this horrible human being if this is my diagnosis and I don\u2019t ever get a bio baby. It\u2019s something that kills me inside.

It's a pretty awful, hurtful thing to say, and I don't blame her at all for being seriously upset about it.\n\nBut - there is *absolutely no excuse* for agreeing to be responsible for children, and then skipping out on that responsibility.  OK, they're 13, they're probably going to be fine on their own - but that was *not* her call to make.  She agreed to babysit them overnight, then skipped out - I would be *beyond* furious if those were my kids.\n\nSo - you're a bit of an asshole for saying something so hurtful, which while provoked, wasn't deserved.

You could have expressed your anger and drew boundaries without saying what you did.", "I was ready to be angry for your sister but I am *pissed* on your behalf instead. If she's can't manage to spend *one night* with her niblings that she agreed to babysit, she definitely doesn't deserve kids.\n\nNTA. 13 y/os can be left alone for a few hours but overnight is waaaay too much.

You are not cursed and she can fuck off.\n\nGo NC to all of the people who tell you \"you are cursed\". Do you want your kids to feel the same way you did as a kid?

You owe her an apology, which you gave. \n\nIn any other circumstance, I\u2019d say Y T A.

It does not matter that it was 9pm and they were \u2018asleep\u2019. It does not matter that she had other plans. It does not matter that they were objectively fine when she arrived. You do not agree to babysit kids and then go out to drink. It\u2019s not safe for their physical or mental health, and evidently not safe as a whole, considering the missing persons in your area. And again, you just don\u2019t do that. Period. \n\nThis has nothing to do with your \u2018curse\u2019 and everything to do with being a responsible adult. Of course you blew up. I would have too. You are absolutely correct, your sister should not be in charge of children, ever. Your family sucks for blaming everything on you and this weird \u2018curse\u2019 that they\u2019ve made up.

And not that it matters but I think missing a middle finger should mean you're less cursed and much holier than your family members, you're so pure of heart you can only flip half as many birds. Plus wouldn't your mom be cursed as you grew inside her womb? Phew, I don't envy you. NTA on any of it.", "Nta", "NTA but if they are so religious how is Anne\u2019s infertility not a sign to them that there is something wrong with her and SHE\u2019S cursed?", "What's cursed more?

She left the kids alone - she was supposed to look after them but chose to party instead.

If the situation wasn't so serious and hurtful I'd laugh at it. (I mean the part about you and your children being 'cursed'.)  First, I come from a pretty religious family and if anyone had ever said something like that to any of her kids or grandkids, she'd have gone to the kitchen to get the wooden spoon. (It was her 'paddle' when we were kids and acted up; she'd smack us on the hands with it.  Not abuse, it was a different time back then.) And she's the most religious of all of us.  Second, she was supposed to be responsible for your kids.  You should have been able to trust that she would be there with them.  Granted, what you said was kind of harsh, but you DID apologize and sometimes we ALL say things in anger that we don't mean.  I'd go no contact with them.  It sounds like your whole family is toxic and you and your kids could be better off.", "No, she is clearly irresponsible and doesn't deserve to have to children, she's shown it clearly, that's a good response.", "i agree with this and i think that the sister and family are truly unstable. however, if the original babysitter stopped being an option for a death in the family, asking the sister to babysit the day after she found out she was infertile was not ideal. both options needed space to grieve and she honored that for the babysitter and not the sister. \n\nthe sister made a promise and is in general horrible and really failed to fulfill what she said she could do. that being said, i don\u2019t think she was emotionally capable of knowing how she\u2019d feel once she was watching someone else\u2019s kids. it was way too soon to ask", "But her sister is indeed a horrible being that doesn't deserve to have children, would you prefer she abuses her kids she were to have them?

From one infertile to another, her sister needs so STRONG therapy.", "Did you read a single word I said?

Like no one deserves to have cancer, or a disability, or something COMPLETELY OUT OF THEIR CONTROL throw back in their face. \n\nSister fucked up, absolutely and she NEEDS to get her shit together, but OP was wrong and you are wrong to say she deserves no children and deserves to be infertile.", "yuuuup! i\u2019m hitting my 4th year of sobriety. i absolutely had a \u201cfuck it\u201d attitude and treated it as permission to go off the rails. the OP has no idea of the mindset that even semi-stable people enter when they get this news, and if someone had asked me to babysit the day after i probably would have asked if they were making a mean joke. the fact that her sister even agreed to it makes me feel like she didn\u2019t know what she was signing up for. this relationship is toxic on both ends and i\u2019m sure it stems from how they were raised; there seemed to be NO recourse for being completely inconsiderate", "Again, everything in her life shows she'd be a bad mother, the logical consequence of her not being infertile and her wanting kids, is her having kids, then it follows they would most likely be abused, you think I'm wrong and I think you're wrong for not thinking all through and condemning kids to abusive parents."]}
