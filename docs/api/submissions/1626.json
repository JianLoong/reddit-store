They were the assholes for making you feel uncomfortable.", "NTA- the event serves alcohol. So if he is unable to be in that environment onus is on him to leave. The world doesn't revolve around him.", "NTA this guy is a fool if he's going to nightclubs that serve drinks while he doesn't feel confident enough in his recovery to be around alcohol. He's the one with the problem, and he needs to make the lifestyle changes, not you.", "NTA - You all paid to be at an event where alcohol was available. They should be the ones to go.", "NTA. How strange to go to a comedy event when he\u2019s obviously struggling so hard with his sobriety. Many people in recovery can\u2019t be around alcohol. It\u2019s strange as many comedy clubs have a drink limit where you have to buy drinks. I wonder if the wife wanted to stay or something. Your boyfriend is wrong. You didn\u2019t rub it in their face that you were drinking. They should have excused themselves or moved somewhere else. Y\u2019all paid money for the seats I\u2019m assuming so you should have enjoyed your time there.", "NTA. The glaring from the couple next to you was weird, but at the end of the day not your problem.\n\nI question whether his assumption/assessment of the situation is correct (his evidence seems flimsy to me) but regardless, that's a them problem, not a you problem. It's a fundraiser at comedy club. The business model revolves around booze! If you don't like being around alcohol but still like comedy, Netflix has plenty of options. If you want to donate to charity but don't like booze, write a check and go play mini-golf instead.", "NTA being in recovery is serious but people shouldn't go to events that they aren't prepared for.

If the guy in recovery can't handle sitting next to people who are drinking, HE should be the one to leave.  He went to a show that served alcohol, what did he expect?  Although it sounds like he didn't actually ask you to leave, he was just visibly uncomfortable.  The biggest AH was the woman glaring at you the whole time for doing something many other people were doing.  \"How dare you drink alcohol at an event where alcohol is served?  You two complete strangers have to change your behavior to support someone in recovery who just happens to be sitting next to you.\"", "NTA. There\u2019s an awesome option for seeing comedy shows but without the alcohol. \n\nTHE FUCKING INTERNET. Turns out pretty much every streaming service has comedy specials! You can have friends over, perhaps other friends in recovery, and have a dry comedy night! \n\nThere are also dry venues. There are comedy podcasts. Hell, MST3K is a solid 2 hours of fun for the whole family. They even have a live show. It\u2019s really good. Bill Corbett and Mary Jo Pehl we\u2019re there last time I saw it. You might even see TV\u2019s Frank. Totally catch it if you can. Worth it.", "NTA\n\nI am sure being in recovery is hard, but you cannot expect strangers to stop drinking around you.", "NTA\n\nThe neighbor, a total stranger, does not dictate whether or not you can drink.  If he cannot handle sitting near someone with a beverage, then he should be the one who stayed home,   You paid to get in, paid for your drinks, and had a right to sit and enjoy the show and your drinks.", "NTA. I\u2019m a recovering alcoholic, and you are right. I am responsible for where I go, and if I can handle it. You are not responsible for my recovery.", "Nta.  This is serious entitlement.", "Nta", "NTA.  I would have begun toasting loudly.", "NTA Should all people leave and they stay all for this show? Your bf really is... you can be sympathic but you can'tcater every need especially when those people could just walk out of this situation. They don't need to be on a comedy show. They brought themself in a situation they can't handle. The right way would be to leave and not to expect that everybody else change/leave. \n\nI clearly don't understand your bf especially when he called you names. But maybe he is one of those that always want to \"save\" everybody. Still that isn't an excuse.", "How was this even an issue? NTA. No way no how.", "No you are NTA and I can't believe you guys were pressured to leave! That is fucking bullshit! I have not had a drink in 24 years and I can tell you the first few years were HARD! My recovery is MY responsibility and it is not fair to put ANYONE else in a position of responsibility over it. I have absolutely no power over alcohol once I drink it BUT I can control the situations I put myself in and I would/will leave any situation that put my sobriety in danger. \n\nThis guy and his partner/friend are setting themselves up for a lot of disappointment if they continue to expect everyone around them to cater to his abstinence. As long as he is assumes that his sobriety is dependent on everyone around him pandering to his wants/needs it will be virtually impossible to stay sober. It's a built in excuse to a relapse because \"those assholes at the bar I was playing pool at wouldn't stop drinking in front of me so it's not my fault I got shit faced\" or something the like will be a recurrent cycle.
