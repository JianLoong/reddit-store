How strange to go to a comedy event when he\u2019s obviously struggling so hard with his sobriety. Many people in recovery can\u2019t be around alcohol. It\u2019s strange as many comedy clubs have a drink limit where you have to buy drinks. I wonder if the wife wanted to stay or something. Your boyfriend is wrong. You didn\u2019t rub it in their face that you were drinking. They should have excused themselves or moved somewhere else. Y\u2019all paid money for the seats I\u2019m assuming so you should have enjoyed your time there.", "NTA.

Your bf really is... you can be sympathic but you can'tcater every need especially when those people could just walk out of this situation. They don't need to be on a comedy show.

My recovery is MY responsibility and it is not fair to put ANYONE else in a position of responsibility over it. I have absolutely no power over alcohol once I drink it BUT I can control the situations I put myself in and I would/will leave any situation that put my sobriety in danger. \n\nThis guy and his partner/friend are setting themselves up for a lot of disappointment if they continue to expect everyone around them to cater to his abstinence. As long as he is assumes that his sobriety is dependent on everyone around him pandering to his wants/needs it will be virtually impossible to stay sober. It's a built in excuse to a relapse because \"those assholes at the bar I was playing pool at wouldn't stop drinking in front of me so it's not my fault I got shit faced\" or something the like will be a recurrent cycle.

He encounters a situation that he is probably the one struggling with himself. This is an assumption of a stranger being in recovery this assumption was given by your boyfriend It appears to be a deflection rather than a known fact. Very much not enough reason to leave granted.

While I would have agreed NTA if the strangers next to you has told you to leave as they have no right is make you have to leave a public event due to personal uncomfortable in a situation in which they could have left from at any point. For whatever reason, your boyfriend was telling you how he wanted to leave  \nand your responses appear to be disregarding his feelings or own issues with drinking and being around alcohol. He called you an Asshole for disregarding him rather than it being about the strangers. As you have already had to skip the pre party avoiding alcohol it appears that the is some deep issue your boyfriend is struggling with that you are not facing either together or with your boyfriend. It is incredibly difficult being in a relationship with someone in recovery no matter the stage as it is a lifelong disease with a great possibility of recovery with an intense amount of lifelong daily work. You have a fixed view on recovery and clearly strong will to sit for almost 3hrs they are while your boyfriend is \u201cbugging you\u201d trying to leave an clearly uncomfortable situation for him.

When alcoholics are in recovery, their family will often get treatment as well since they're also highly affected by the drinking as well as having some sort of role in enabling the addict. It sounds to me like the guys' SOs' way of dealing with his alcoholism is blaming it on everyone else instead of directing her feelings at her SO who is, in the end, the only one that can choose between being sober or not.\n\nI have a friend that I got to know 5 years ago. I knew we'd become friends when her second sentence to me was \"I'm an alcoholic but I don't drink anymore\" which told me that she was a person who had no trouble talking about difficult stuff either. I let her guide me towards how to be around her and what she felt comfortable with.\n\nOur third meeting was me picking her up to go to the airport and us spending 9 days together abroad. I had told her when planning this that I'd hate having to be completely sober during a holiday and her response was \"It's my responsibility to stay sober, not yours. You can drink as much as you want around me but if you're an annoying drunk I'm going to leave the room. If you can live with that, I can live with you drinking next to me\". We had an awesome holiday and I had the beers and wine I wanted and she was pleasantly surprised that she never felt the need to walk away. I felt like the meanest person ever when she said stuff like \"I'm getting more coffee, do you want your wine topped up?\" and then she'd bring me a fresh glass. She was very open about having zero problems with this and I decided that she's a grown up and an extremely strong person so it would be unfair to coddle her. I still let her be in charge of her sobriety and she hasn't relapsed in the 5 years I've known her. She frequently shows up here with a six pack of some sort she's found while dumpster diving and she's too cheap to let them stay in the dumpster when she knows people that would enjoy them. \n\nI've asked how she's managed not relapsing? Her response was \"I know if I drink I need to go to rehab again and I still haven't seen a drink delicious enough to make me OK with costing me more than 10k so it's easy for me to choose\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP shouldn't have been forced to leave the show.
