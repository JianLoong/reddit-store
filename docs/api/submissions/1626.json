It\u2019s strange as many comedy clubs have a drink limit where you have to buy drinks. I wonder if the wife wanted to stay or something. Your boyfriend is wrong. You didn\u2019t rub it in their face that you were drinking. They should have excused themselves or moved somewhere else. Y\u2019all paid money for the seats I\u2019m assuming so you should have enjoyed your time there.", "NTA.

Your bf really is... you can be sympathic but you can'tcater every need especially when those people could just walk out of this situation. They don't need to be on a comedy show.

My recovery is MY responsibility and it is not fair to put ANYONE else in a position of responsibility over it. I have absolutely no power over alcohol once I drink it BUT I can control the situations I put myself in and I would/will leave any situation that put my sobriety in danger. \n\nThis guy and his partner/friend are setting themselves up for a lot of disappointment if they continue to expect everyone around them to cater to his abstinence. As long as he is assumes that his sobriety is dependent on everyone around him pandering to his wants/needs it will be virtually impossible to stay sober. It's a built in excuse to a relapse because \"those assholes at the bar I was playing pool at wouldn't stop drinking in front of me so it's not my fault I got shit faced\" or something the like will be a recurrent cycle.

What unacceptable behavior from literally everyone involved except OP.", "Nta. His recovery is on him", "NTA.  They went to a comedy show at a bar knowing full well that this would be a difficulty for them.  That\u2019s not on you.", "Any bets that anyone who took the OP's and her boyfriend's seats were also drinking alcohol?", "NTA. Your boyfriend seems like a dick.", "NTA. They CHOOSE to stay at an event serving alcohol. If you're in recovery, you AVOID those places. My husband is 4yrs sober. If he feels tempted when we go somewhere, guess what we do? We leave!!", "NTA. Other peoples triggers and addictions aren't your problem when they are willingly entering a place with temptation.", "As someone in recover NTA", "NTA I'm an addict and my recovery is my responsibility....if a place is going to be a trigger it's on me to either but go or leave when it becomes an issue", "NTA.", "I'd be angrier at bf than at the random stranger glaring. It's just kind of expected that random people at bars are terrible but why is he so bothered by how strangers perceive him that he must ruin your night out together? As pointed out by many in this thread the man in question and his partner made the choice to enter a triggering space for them what others do with their autonomy in that space is out of their control. They don't get to bully you out of the show, if the comedian was drinking a beer would that have been too oppressive? Your at a bar, people will drink, so why is your boy friend so willing to white knight for random ass holes? \n\nNTA but bf sure is.", "\nNTA to the couple I\u2019ll get downvoted for this , but it sounds like your boyfriend got embarrassed.  I understand you wanting to take a stand, but sometimes you have to compromise for people you love instead of being petty", "NTA. I\u2019ve been in recovery for 23 years and have never heard of a sober person or their partner going out in public and expecting the people around them not to drink. It sounds like the guy is really new and probably ought to be hanging out with other people in recovery instead of going to bars and clubs.", "His sobriety isn\u2019t your responsibility. NTA.", "NTA. If his recovery is too fragile to be around alcohol...he shouldn't be around alcohol. None of that is your responsibility.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis is part of addiction and recovery - being in situations with alcohol triggers.  If he is not ready for that stage of recovery, he should not be at a show where alcohol is being served.  You and you alone are not the trigger.  The entire audience is the trigger.\n\nIf your boyfriend felt that it was simply the proximity to you that was causing the problem, then the guy who was in recovery would have placed his date between you and him.  And your accommodating boyfriend could have sat between you and the date, not drinking.  Giving the guy a buffer of two people between him and the drinker.  But still leaving him exposed to drinkers on his other side, in front of him and behind him.  Because again - YOU were not the problem.  The entire audience was the problem.", "NTA you're not responsible for someone else's recovery.  The only person who is responsible for a someone's recovery is the person in recovery.  Other's can support their recovery sure, but if the person in recovery is 8n a situation that is triggering for them it's theor responsibility to leave/manage it appropriately.", "NTA - the recovery guy & his wife are the AHs\u2026they shouldn\u2019t have been there if he is that fragile.", "NTA- He will always face these situations. He can't expect everyone in every situation to accommodate him. That is very unreasonable and unrealistic. It's up to him to either find the coping skills to get through the situation or leave. The lady that was with him was way out of line. It was an event with alcohol. If it was so bothersome they should have been the ones to leave. Sorry you had to miss the end of your show.", "OK, wait. I'm assuming the seating was BF, You, Guy in Recovery, Glaring Woman.\n\nIf you were such a big issue for him, he could have traded places with his Glaring Woman. You could then have traded places with BF.\n\nIn any case, NTA.", "Nta but  your bf was and  so was the guy and his gf were  TA. Comedy shows have a few drinks minimum. Not everyone is going to order a ice coffee. If he had a big issue with being around someone next to him drinking then he could have switch seats or he could have left.", "NTA it's a comedy club of course there's booze and why did he go?", "Don't worry, his little pamphlet was there to save him. Honestly, I'm sympathetic to substance abuse issues but what the hell was he doing at a comedy show if he couldn't handle being by a White Claw?", "I don't think the guy was the issue;  he's not the one who was glaring at op, and making op's boyfriend uncomfortable. The addicts girlfriend is an asshat though.  \n\nIt was their decision to go to an event that clearly was no alcohol free.  The addict decided to stay anyway.  That was his choice.  SHE chose to make it ops problem and make everyone uncomfortable.  And ops boyfriend is spineless.  \n\nOP is correct.  It is on the addict to decide what they are comfortable with.  Not op, her boyfriend, or the addicts girlfriend.  They shouldn't have left.", "Yep! Addict in recovery here also, this is so true.", "He should have stood up for her, but you may be right that he isn't an AH.", "What is a white claw?", "The story doesn't say he drank, so I think he handled it ok. Might've been his first time in this kind of situation sober, it's hard to tell in advance what's going to be difficult. He didn't say or do anything other than attend, be nervous, fidget a bit, and read a pamphlet. Sounds like his partner was rude (glaring) but that's his partner's problem.", "What a fucking weirdo. Who carries around a pamphlet about ALCOHOLISM to just whip out and peruse during a comedy show? That is honestly really fucking bizarre. NTA.", "Seriously, who does that?", "Thank you kindly! I truly can't take all the credit as I had so many people in recovery support and guide me on the way. The old timers who were in the rooms when I got sober would call me out on bullshit like this if I tried it. There's no room to lie to ourselves in recovery.", "What I don\u2019t understand is why your boyfriend insisted you leave. Why not just insist you stop drinking and throw away the alcohol? You shouldn\u2019t have to do that either but I makes more sense than leaving", "NTA - You all paid to be at an event where alcohol was available. They should be the ones to go.", "They are a brand of seltzers, flavored sparkling water with usually less alcohol than a beer. \n\nOn of the least obvious alcoholic drinks there is both in taste smell and looks. They are basically soft drinks with a hint of alcohol.", "I thought it was weird too but whatever helps I guess. He seemed EARLY into it", "Maybe seeing someone else struggling with their addiction was triggering to the bf because it brought up past memories of himself trying to stay sober.", "Wouldn\u2019t you use an app or something for that? Dude clearly wanted attention. How exhausting.", "That\u2019s possible honestly. It wasn\u2019t brought up but based on his reaction that could be it. I didn\u2019t even think of that"]}
