How many times could you have tried to return it within a 2-4 day window? \n\nI'd have put it in storage, out of sight and held onto it. She shouldn't have forced it on you, but I definitely wouldn't have sold it or thrown it away. But this story or timelines is obviously fake.", "ESH - Coming from someone who has a mother very much like this, I think both parties are at fault here.\n\nYou had choices. You could've talked to your mother about how she was pushing your boundaries by trying to guilt trip you into wearing the gown. If you both sat and talked it out, maybe you could've made a compromise on getting the dress altered or even using parts of it in the gown you wanted (with her permission to alter her original dress, of course).\n\nMy mom tries to push things onto me and before she gets the chance to exchange ownership, I tell her flat out \"I will not use this. I do not want this. And if you give it to me would you like me to sell it because I don't want it taking up space in my life? Or would you rather hold onto it knowing that that's the risk you take once it's in my hands?\" It's called 'setting boundaries'.\n\nShe's TA if she keeps forcing it and making you uncomfortable.\n\nYou both have totally different views on what you value as a 'family heirloom'. But selling it without her knowing or giving her a choice to take it back? Not ok.", "INFO: Exactly *how* did you attempt to return the dress? Did you drop it off her house, and then she brought it back? Did you mail it to her, and she mailed it back? From the wording in your post, what I gather is that \u201cattempts\u201d at returning were verbal discussions and never a true physical attempt at returning the dress.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, YTA. I would have been \u201crude\u201d and actually *physically* given it back \u2014 not go nuclear and sell it behind her back. For whatever reason (I can never understand it), she\u2019s obsessed with wanting you to wear it, and I think it\u2019s clear the dress is important to her. You should have at least given her a heads up BEFORE you sold it. She probably would have finally taken the dress back. If not, *then* that\u2019s her fault, and she would have no one to blame but herself.\n\nThe fact that you hid the sale from her makes it pretty obvious to me that even you know you were in the wrong. I get that your mom was being overbearing, but two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\n\nPS: I\u2019m also curious how you advertised the dress and also how the heck she found it. There\u2019s thousands of used dresses for sale online. Did you speak fondly of it in the listing? Maybe part of why she\u2019s so mad is the language you used. Maybe part of the reason is that you sold it on Facebook Marketplace, which would explain how she found out. On top of being mad, she might also be embarrassed. That\u2019s pure speculation.\n\nEDIT: I just reread your post. She gave you the dress \u201cabout a week ago.\u201d You claim to attempt to give back the dress but sold it. Then, 2 days ago, she calls you. That must mean you sold the dress almost immediately. It doesn\u2019t sound like you made a good faith effort to return the dress or even just communicate properly.", "\u201ci\u2019m choosing to sell it. if you would like it back, pick it up by x date\u201d \n \nyta.", "ESH you don't have to wear the dress but YTA for selling it", "NTA.\n\nYou told your mother you didn't want to wear the gown.\n\nYou told your mother you didn't want the gown when she brought it to you.\n\nYou tried to return the gown to her several times and she refused to take it back, telling you it was YOUR dress now.\n\nYou sold \"your\" dress.  She was being emotionally manipulative, and if she's going to insist on giving you something you don't want, then you are perfectly within your rights to sell or do whatever you want to with it.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have forced her dress on you after you said no. But you could\u2019ve just stuck it in a corner somewhere, bought your own dress, and given her dress back to her after the ceremony.

Or why couldn't you have said \"Mom, I don't want the dress and if you don't take it back I'm going to sell it or donate it.\"?\n\nI suspect neither your mother nor you were as clear or forceful as you suggest.

Although I knew it wasn't a nice thing to do, she was right - it was mine now - therefore, I could do whatever I wanted with it. \n\nYou anticipated that your mom would find out and be upset which is exactly what happened. So what do you want to be judged on? Your mom shouldn't have tried to force you to wear or keep the dress but you admit that you thought selling the dress would hurt her and did it anyway.", "I really think you should have given her the heads up you were going to sell it.\n\nHowever, she gave it to you. Not loaned, gave. And with gifts you can do what you wish with them.\n\nEsh", "ESH yes your mom was being pushy and not listening to you, but you took the nuclear route by selling the dress without telling her.", "ESH \nShe got to choose her dress and obviously loved it, so why is she taking away your one and only (hopefully) chance to get a dress that you adore too? It's not an heirloom yet (unless it was given to her by her mum, but doesn't sound like that from your post). \n\nHowever. You should have warned her that if she didn't take it back you'd get rid. She was wrong to pressure you to take it but probably really felt and hoped that you'd change your mind. Now her dress, that she loved, is gone forever.", "Info: How close are you two?\n\n\"She kept telling me that it was mine now, and it'd be rude to give it back.\"\n\nYou probably could've asked whether it's okay selling it to be on the safe side but I'd understand that it's a gift from this point on and therefore mine to do whatever I please with. However, knowing that she was so hopeful means that you probably knew she would be upset by your actions and you were probably doing it with the intent to make her stop asking. You also wouldn't hide it if it weren't wrong.", "NTA \n\nYou tried to return and and she refused. \n\nIs she typically this manipulative?", "NTA. Your mom sounds controlling. From what you\u2019ve written this \u201cfamily heirloom\u201d has only been worn by your mom, not by her mom, and her mom\u2019s mom, and her mom\u2019s mom\u2019s mom, etc. Also, lifelong memories? It\u2019s been worn (assumably) once. Keeping the dress in your possession would allow her to keep up her disillusionment. You were never going to wear that dress, and you even tried to give it back multiple times. Could you have given her the ultimatum \u201ctake it back or I sell it\u201d? Sure, but honestly it feels like no matter what you did she was going to expect you to keep and wear that dress.", "ESH. She shouldn't have tried to force her dress on you, but selling it was going too far. If you hated looking at it, you could've put it in the attic/basement/back of a closet, where you didn't have to see it. If she refused to take it back after your wedding, when you wearing it was no longer an option, maybe then sell it. Or at least tell her if she doesn't take it back you'll sell it.", "ESH. Your mom was being way too pushy, but you definitely should have known that selling the dress would hurt her. The dress obviously had a lot of sentimental value to her. I find it really hard to believe that you were out of options for returning it (dropping it back off to her and refusing to take it when you left seems pretty straightforward.) But even if you couldn\u2019t return it, you should\u2019ve just shoved it in the back of a closet until after the wedding. Selling it was extreme.", "I feel like esh. You should've at least told her that you plan to sell the dress if she doesn't take it back.", "ESH. You\u2019ve sold off her dress and she can\u2019t get it back. And you did it to be cruel. Yes your mom sucks but you also suck.", "Slight ESH. It was a gift, and yours to do with as you pleased. You tried to give it back and we're told you were being rude. We'll, now she's being rude in being upset that her gift wasn't used the way she wanted. It's a gift and she doesn't get to dictate how that gift is used.\n\nIt sounds like your issues are a lot more than this dress. She's trying to dictate what you wear on your wedding day without any regard for your wants and feelings. This isn't her wedding, this isn't a celebration of your parents' relationship or their relationship with you. It's about you and your fiance, and she's lost sight of that completely. And if you want to have a healthy relationship with your mother moving forward, the two of you need to resolve this somehow. \n\nBecause by selling the dress, even if it was the choice of last resort, you've now deeply hurt your mother. Her having deeply hurt you doesn't negate or excuse that. So now you've both done what you can to damage your relationship, which is why I'm giving the slight ESH. It's not really about the dress at all, and you could have found ways to address these issues without selling the dress that you knew she treasured.", "ESH (you less than your mom but still). She pushed and pushed you over a big piece of fabric basically. It\u2019s sentimental to her and it could be to you as well but that doesn\u2019t justify her being an absolute shit about you wearing it. Your wedding is about you/your partner and not her. The idea that weddings are about the parents as much as the couple comes from old ideas about women being property of their parents until they get married. \n\nAnyway, you shouldn\u2019t have sold it and you wouldn\u2019t be the asshole if you\u2019d just put it in storage or in a closet where you don\u2019t have to see it (or even if you\u2019d given it to another relative to hold on to for you). She still is more of the AH but you\u2019re not totally in the clear here.", "ESH. Your mom should not think that she gets to choose what you wear on your big day. But you had to know that selling it was going to hurt her, she kept the thing for decades! You both owe each other an apology.", "I'm going ESH. your mother was being way too controlling. I get the idea of passing down a wedding dress, but insisting on it that persistanly is over the line. \n\nI think OP is more than within her right to wear a different dress kd she wants to, but selling something like that is a pretty crappy thing to do. You could have easily got one of those vacuume storage bags and packed it away and not had to look at it. \n\nHopefully you 2 can get past this.", "ESH You're not an asshole for not wanting to wear it but even though she gave it to you, you still should have told her you were going to sell it so she could have got it back if she wanted it", "ESH but I would have told her \"if you don't take the dress back, I will be selling it\"\n\nThen if that was the case, I'd say NTA but in this situation ESH. Mom shouldn't have forced it on you, but I agree that YTA for selling it without telling her beforehand.", "ESH. Neither of you were willing to hear the other one's point of view and reach a compromise. Your mother was forcing her vision on to you, and you sold an heirloom that you clearly knew meant a lot to her.", "ESH\n\nYour mom is trying to make a new tradition/heirloom that is unwanted. Ok, so she gave you that dress and said \"it was necessary to have the special connection of mother-daughter on my wedding day.\" Does the dress belong to her mother? And her mother before her? Or is it the dress she picked out for her big day, that she has held onto, and projected her expectations onto you with? It's bullshit for her to rob you of the joy of picking a dress out with her.\n\nYou suck for selling it. I get that your mom pissed you off and seeing the dress made you mad but you shouldn't have sold it. Before everyone says \"it was gifted to her, she can do as she pleases,\" think about the implication. OP could ask around in the family to see if anyone else wants it first, or really stand her ground about not hanging onto it, or have it made into a veil or something.", "ESH - you know you're in the wrong here so I'm not sure why you're asking. Your mother should have been less pushy for sure, she's got a portion of the guilt. You went nuclear though and you've probably forever altered your relationship with your mother. It sounds like you had a good one before this, which says a lot about what kind of person your mother is beyond this narrow view of pushiness. \n\nAlso - you managed to try to return it multiple times, post it and sell it within a few days? Put it in the attic and stop engaging with her about it, call her and tell her you'll sell it if she doesn't pick up, ask a cousin/friend to store it for you if you don't have space... so many rational options to the point I kind of don't believe this is real.", "\u201cMom, I love you, but I am not going to wear your dress at my wedding. I don\u2019t want to store it for you either, so if you don\u2019t take it back, I\u2019m going to get rid of it.\u201d Why not just communicate to her? I\u2019m sure the threat would have been enough no? She saved her dress for years because it was special to her, and you got mad at got rid of it forever. But she never should have pressured you so intensely to do something you didn\u2019t want to do. ESH", "ESH she shouldn't have forced the dress on you and trying to bully you into wearing her dress is definitely a crossed boundary. However, you shouldn't have sold it. Just don't wear it and then give it back to her after the wedding if she wants it back. If she then started on at you and still didnt take the dress back then going NC and selling the dress would've been justified.", "ESH. You knew how much that dress meant to her, so selling it was a dick move. On the other hand, her repeatedly demanding you wear her dress instead of one you wanted and refusing to take no for an answer was also a dick move.", "The comments are very split. I'm going with a gentle ESH - your mother repeatedly refused to take no for an answer (including her repeated refusals to take the dress back), but I do think you should have given her a heads up that you were thinking of selling it (at minimum), and preferably just taken the dress back to her house and left it there (even if you had to do it while she was out!).\n\nYou know your mother best, OP. I can see that a lot of people here are suggesting you should've just kept the dress in storage and not used it; it seems to me that that would just be kicking the problem down the road, though. Would it have kept the peace? How do you think your mother would have reacted when you got your actual dress? Or when you turned up to the wedding in not-her-dress?", "ESH. You could\u2019ve mailed it back to her, or asked a friend to hold onto it. You knew selling it was the nuclear option and you did it anyway.", "ESH. She shouldn't try to force it on you but selling something that clearly meant a lot to her is  crazy.", "Did the people voting yta not see how you've said you haven't been interested in it since you were a teen? Mom was fully aware, she just wanted to keep pushing so she could project on you and relive her \"glory days\" or what the hell ever. \n\nNTA, it's your big day and she's trying to make it about herself. She played the classic game of fucking around so she found out. If she wants the dress back so bad she should offer to buy the dress back from the new owners after she's done", "ESH. Your mom was pretty pushy about you wearing that damned dress. And I could see where looking at it would piss you off after awhile. But you could have told her what you were doing. Even if she said it\u2019s yours now, respond, \u201cYes, that\u2019s why I am going to sell it in a week if you think that way.\u201d And if she doesn\u2019t come get it in a week, then place that ad up!", "I'm gonna go with ESH. \n\nIt's your wedding day. You, as the bride, deserve to have a dress that you feel beautiful in. She shouldn't have forced the dress on you and disregarded your feelings on the matter. It's your big day, her day has passed and she needs to accept that you have different tastes. \n\nHowever, you sold the dress to be spiteful. The sight of the dress pissed you off, really?  What was she going to do, physically force you into the dress? You could have sat her down and told her that you were, in no uncertain terms, not going to wear the dress. If she didn't listen, she would have found out on the day of the wedding. If you were still set on selling the dress, you should have told her so she understood the consequences of dismissing your feelings and had the chance to take the dress back. \n\nThe dress meant nothing to you, but it held a lot of emotional importance to your mom. There were so many other options and you chose to be hurtful. Worse, you basically rubbed it in her face that her dress was gone and then blamed her for you deciding to sell it. You felt guilty for a reason.", "ESH\n\nYour mom sucks for not understanding that you want to wear a wedding dress thats just yours and you suck for selling the dress that could've just been boxed up and stored away.", "ESH - She shouldn't be telling you what to wear on your wedding, but that dress could have at least been a keepsake. She wanted to be remembered by it.", "I can understand your frustration. It sounds like your mother is trying to live out her dream wedding for you instead of supporting you in making your own, which makes her in part the AH.\n\nThat said, there were many other things you could have done other than sell the dress to never have in the family again, which makes you in part the AH. \n\n**INFO: Do you happen to know where she got the dress? Had it been passed down for some generations already?** If so, then an apology is not going to be a quick fix.\n\nI can empathize with your frustration but there were maturer ways to handle this.

It was YOURS to do with as you pleased, and if it was so important to her, she shouldn't have given it to you and refused to take it back. It was a gift you didn't want and she knew that. Actions have consequences and maybe this is the first time I her life she's realizing this. Hopefully you two can work it out, but if she was this pushy about the dress, I would imagine she is with other things as well. If she saw you on your wedding day not in it and hadn't seen that you sold it, would her reaction be any different? She probably would have thrown a fit at your wedding and created a bunch of drama, before and during. Good for you for sticking to your boundaries.

Try to coordinate with the person you sold it with to get it back after her wedding. At the very least, apologize to your mom.", "YTA. I don't believe you had no idea how hurtful this would be for your mom, or that you didn't want to give her a taste of how frustrated and angry you are with the situation by selling it.

Your mom sounds really pushy and self-centered. She was trying to make your wedding day about her and her vision instead of letting you create the memories you wanted.

I feel really sorry for your mum. Sure, she was pushy and annoying and that\u2019s wrong but clearly the dress was really important to her and holds a lot of sentimental value to her. \n\nWhat you did was petty and cruel.", " NTA. What crazy mom demands a daughter wear her dress\u2026or else?", "ESH\n\nYour mom for pushing the gown on you without listening to your repeated claims of not wanting it.\n\nYou for selling it without a heads up to your mom.\n\nThere was a clear compromise here, you simply could have held onto it until after the wedding, then given it back. I'm sure you are not the only female in the family, after returning the gown your mom would have had the option to give it to another female in the family, or to sell/donate it herself. Although it was a gift to you, it could have become a gift to someone else down the line and stayed in the family that way. Or one day with your own line of children, you could have gifted it to them if they showed interest in the gown. \n\nYears ago (2006) when I was engaged to my high school sweetheart (thankfully it didn't work out), my mom brought her wedding gown down from the attic for me to try on. It was a dress from the early 80s, so obviously not the style I wanted. I kindly told my mother that although I was deeply touched by the sentiment of her saving the dress all those years for me, I didn't want to wear it. Although disappointed, she respected what I said, then donated it to a wedding consignment shop. She didn't tell me until years later and I was a little disappointed because even though I didn't want to wear it, it would have been nice to offer it to my future children (I now have 4 daughters), but guess what, it was her dress, so she could do whatever she wanted, and I had no say in the matter. \n\nIf you really love your mom (which it does sound like you do), I suggest going to see her and tell her how she made you feel by pushing the dress on you, and that it was immature of you to sell it without at least letting her know first. Your mom's feelings are obviously hurt, and as an adult you need to recognize your role in hurting her feelings. I wouldn't say this is a boundary issue as a lot of commenters are saying, so much as a hurt feelings issue.", "NTA. She gave it to you. She refused to take it back.

It's yours to do with at you wish.", "NTA. Your mom was trying to control you and your wedding. You could have burned the dress if you wanted.

If she didn\u2019t want it sold she should have taken it back the first time you offered to return it.", "YTA. My mother expressed she wanted me to wear her dress and I firmly told her no. She would drop comments here and there but I stood firm. You have that power to put whatever you want on your body and you didn\u2019t have to stoop so low by selling her dress.

You sold the dress within a week of you getting it and you already knew your mother would be mad/sad if you did it. It would have been much easier to just put the dress in a box and give it back after a couple of weeks", "Yeah. YTA. So she gave it to you. You didn't have to wear it. You could still have any dress you want. All you had to do was say ' I'm not wearing it. I'm getting my own gown. ' and given her time to collect it. Not sell it with literally no warning.", "ESH \n\nShe shouldn't have pushed so hard after you'd already told her you didn't want to wear it but you definitely shouldn't have sold it.

So keeping it for awhile was like 2-3 days? It sounds to me like you decided to sell it pretty much instantly out of spite, because that all feels quick. \n\nYour mom shouldn\u2019t have been so pushy, but you should have told her you were planning to sell it if she didn\u2019t want it back.", "ESH \n\nYour mother should not have been pressuring you to wear her dress and it was wrong for her to ignore your boundaries but to sell her gown was beyond mean.", "Esh. You have every right to wear something that's you love on your wedding day, but selling her dress is a huge asshole move. Like it's petty to the max, it wasn't hurting you just sitting in the closet so it seemed like you sold it so you could put that final nail in the coffin of you not wearing it. But the thing is  that you never had to, and what you did was honestly really mean towards your mom. Someone else loving the dress won't take that hurt away, so you shouldnt wrap yourself in the idea that its fine just becausw the dress is being worn. She shouldn't have pushed it on you and left it there at your place, for that she is also an asshole, but I can see where you get your lack of regard/consoderation for other people, you two just made your relationship rocky and I hope you guys can talk it out and forgive eachother", "NTA at all.

At that point it was, no room for doubt, yours to do with what you will.

No. If Mom truly gave the dress to OP and said \u201cit\u2019s yours now\u201d OP can do what she wants with it. She could have lit it on fire if she\u2019d wanted.", "Do you really think Mom would have just accepted that quietly?  She was clearly trying to exert influence here.  There would have been a reaction from her regardless of when she realized her gambit had failed.", "Every day? Or even more?", "Bingo exactly what's happening", "I\u2019m agreeing w you btw", "You factually know mom cares a lot about the dress. Mom is a jerk for trying to force ops hand, but OP knows she was a jerk for immediately selling something she knows her mom cares about. OP could have just as easily dropped the dress off at her mom's.", "There is. She described it as a family heirloom - which clearly means it was intended to remain in the OP's hands until *her* daughters were coerced into wearing it *et cetera ad nauseum*.\n\nLoaned is loaned. Given is given. This wasn't loaned.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "Then maybe mom should have accepted it back!!", "Except for the fact that OP tried to return the dress multiple times and her mother \u201ckept telling me it was mine now.\u201c\n\nFifth paragraph down.", "All that would have done is start a fight.  Be reasonable here.", "So....OP should just let her annoying and boundary crossing mother to walk all over her? Um, no.", "You missed the part where OP says her mother ***told*** her that she had to wear her dress because \"it is necessary to have the special connection of mother-daughter\" on OP's wedding day.  This wasn't a request on OP's mom's part, it was a declaration.  You are missing just how *toxic* OP's mother actually is.\n\nI've also seen mother's request that their daughters wear their old dress on their wedding day.  However, those mothers have always taken \"No\" for an answer and not forced their dress on their daughter.\n\nSo, who the fuck ignores their daughter's wishes, forces the dress they know they don't want onto them and refuses to take the dress back?", "> but that doesn't give her the right to get rid of someone else's property without their consent.\n\nBut the mom insisted it was her property now.\n\nIt's really wild all these ESH votes. The mom couldn't care less about the feelings of her daughter, and is now trying to make her feel guilty for... not letting her mother walk all over her at her wedding??\n\nwow...", "Except it's ops wedding, so their opinions simply do not have the same relevance.", "It's her wedding that she's paying for. It is her way or the highway.", "Pretty sure that, after mom refused to accept the dress back and insisted it was now OP's, it wasn't her mom's dress anymore. Why should she hold on to something she never wanted in the first place? Why should she indulge mom's tantrum here?", "Please clarify your answer. Not sure why the daughter is supposed to honor her mom\u2018s request. Mom already had a chance at her own wedding. Mom is being selfish by trying to impose her wishes on to the OP.\n\nFeel free to make an argument to the contrary. Otherwise, I\u2019m not going to engage in a snarky back and forth.", "\"Keep up with two dresses\" ....it's not a puppy, you don't need to feed and water it. You hang it in a closet and forget about it.", "My God you are right. All my old socks and shirts in my wardrobe just take so much *upkeep*. I can barely cope.\n\nDo you really think OP's mum had in mind that her daughter would sell her wedding dress to a stranger when she said she gave it to her? Don't be daft.", "I think the best thing to do was for OP to flat out tell her mom if she didn\u2019t accept the dress back she\u2019d be selling it.", "Sure, OP could have tried 1x/day for 5 days, or 2x/day for 3 days - but I think giving Mom more time to accept that she wasn't wearing it is more important than how many times/how often within a very short period. \n\nIt kind of seemed like Mom was starting to accept OP wouldn't wear it, but still wanted her to have it. (It sounded like the conversation changed from \"you will wear my dress\" to \"I gave it to you, it'd be rude to return it\" after OP tried to return it a few times.. sounds more like it's just that Mom wants her to have this family heirloom in her possession)\n\nOP couldn't handle looking at it because she didn't like Mom telling her to wear it and referring to it as \"her\" dress so she sold it somewhat out of spite. I get that Mom shouldn't have pushed it on her and wasn't listening, but OP knew how much it meant to Mom. She didn't want to wear the dress, sure - I wouldn't either, but trying to get rid of it every day for multiple days? Being annoyed just looking at the dress? Selling it after only a few days? That is crapping on the sentimental gesture. It would have been very little effort to keep in a closet. Instead she got triggered by looking at the sentimental gesture / family heirloom and wasted no time putting it up for sale. By selling it, she showed Mom how little her heirloom and her Mom mean to her. \n\nShe could have given her more time, but at the very least she should have told Mom it'd be sold if she did not take it back. If you never fight with Mom, it makes me wonder how out of character this is for her. If this isn't typical for Mom, then give her more time to accept it, or accept how important it means to her and keep it in a closet or basement for your mother's sake.", "Ah okay, apologies for getting defensive! I\u2019m sorry, sometimes I really can\u2019t tell on this sub who\u2019s arguing with me and who\u2019s agreeing lol.", "Thats your opinion. I dont think that was the intention. Usually wedding dresses are loaned and it sounds like Mom thought that forcing her to keep the dress would make her change her mind.", "Then her mother shouldnt have been upset when she sold it. Clearly her mother intended for her to keep it because she wanted it to stay in the family. Not be sold. Which tells me that she didnt ACTUALLY give it to her to do what she wanted with. \n\nIts all in the subtext.", "ESH doesn't mean we think the mom's behavior is okay. It means everyone sucks here. Perhaps you should review how the forum works?\n\nSelling the dress was obviously meant to hurt Mom, and the OP even expresses guilt in the post for how she handled it. Mom was a little pushy and not a great listener, but OP's behavior was callous as well. Both of them need to grow up and be better communicators.", "OP could\u2019ve simply gotten a different dress and not wore it. I\u2019m sure her mom wasn\u2019t going to hold her down on her wedding day and force it on her. \n\nShe sold it knowing her mom would be upset out of spite. Her mom was being insufferable with the pushing. Is being a bigger jerk the better move? \n\nSometimes people on Reddit give these advice and opinions that aren\u2019t based in the reality that these are relationships that most people want to retain. People who consistently act like OP will end up alone basking in being \u201cright.\u201d \n\nOP is an adult that could\u2019ve just said no, ignored the asking to wear it, and moved on. She made a bad situation worse.", "Hah this made me laugh.", "Idk about you or OP but my closet is not big enough for two wedding dresses and the commenter I was responding to worded it like the bride would spring mom\u2019s wedding dress back on mom at the wedding. It\u2019s not worth it. \n\nSure OP could have just taken the dress back to her mom\u2019s house and left it on the porch but then there\u2019s the chance that mom would have just brought it back. This way it\u2019s out of both their hands, literally.", "Socks and shirts fold. Wedding dresses don\u2019t. They hang and take up tons of space in a closet. Two wedding dresses would basically take up all the closet space. Plus what was OP to do with the dress once the wedding was over and she hadn\u2019t worn it? Leave it in the closet forever until mom dies?", "I agree that would be fair", "She told her before she didn't like it.", "Mom is an idiot for that. Especially after being told *multiple times* that her daughter didn\u2019t want to wear the damn dress.", "It doesn't matter what Mom's intention was.  She wasn't going to get her way and she kept pushing.  I see this as one last attempt to say \"no\" in a way her mother couldn't strongarm her way past.\n\nWhen dealing with a manipulative person, especially a passive aggressive one (God that's such a horrible combination!), sometimes the only way to defend yourself is to do something so drastic that the matter is settled for all time.\n\nSure, Mom will explode but that was always going to happen anyway no matter what because she wasn't getting her way, and that was clearly an unacceptable outcome from Mom.\n\nNo matter what, Mom now HAS to accept that her daughter will not be wearing her wedding dress now.  Which I strongly suspect is all OP wanted to accomplish anyway.    Would not be shocked if that's the majority of the reason for her outburst on learning the news.  OP finally found a way to get the word \"no\" into her mother's titanium skull.", ">She kept telling me that it was mine now, and it'd be rude to give it back.\n\nThe minute mom said \"She kept telling me that it was mine now, and it'd be rude to give it back.\" she lost all claim to the dress. OP attempted multiple times to return the dress to her and she refused and blocked any discussion of it. Mom needs to learn boundaries and communication and hopefully she will stop hearing only what she wants to hear.", "You can\u2019t admit that you got it wrong, can you lol. Getting upset is what makes the mom the asshole. Because she had no right to be upset after refusing to accept the dress back multiple times. Daughter told her from the outset  that she wasn\u2019t going to wear it. That\u2019s in the 3rd paragraph down.", "She said no and her mom forced it on her. Then she tried to return it at least three times. At that point, the mom is to take responsibility for her decisions.", "Thats your opinion. I have mine. \n\nIts not the first time a mom has tried to manipulate their child into doing something this way. She thought by forcing her to keep it, the daughter would change her mind. Pretty basic manipulation tactic. \n\nOP called her bluff by selling the dress. But that still doesnt make it right. It was a family heirloom. If she didnt want to wear it, she could have packed it into a box and left it at the back of her closet. Instead she deliberately sold it because she was angry about the situation.", "There\u2019s your opinion and then there are the facts. \nFact one: Once given, a gift belongs to the recipient.\n\nFact two:  even before she received the dress, the OP told her mom she would not wear it.\n\nFact three:  OP attempted to return the dress at least three times and was rejected on each occasion, being told \u201cit\u2019s [hers] now.\u201c\n\nFact four:  OP is not required to store things on someone else\u2019s behalf.\n\nExplain how OP could be TA.", "For selling the dress. How stupid are you? \n\nIt was a family heirloom. She should have just packed it away and sold it after the wedding if she really didnt want it. Instead she deliberately escalated the situation by selling it beforehand. \n\nIt would have been a lot harder for Mom to get mad if she just did it after the wedding. Then theres no reason for her to freak out since the wedding is done.", "OP is *also* the AH in this situation, they both suck. \n\nher mom for not taking no as an answer, which is obvious, **however**, its obvious that the dress holds a lot of importance to the mom, and instead of saying \u201cmom, im not wearing this dress, ill never wear it, and its going to sit in a box collecting dust until you take it back\u201d or *even* \u201cmom, i dont want this dress, so either you take it back or ill sell it to someone who does want it\u201d, OP just sneakily got rid of something in a way that she knew was wrong. \n\nthere were so many ways to go about this that didnt include selling the dress straight away. going nuclear is what makes this an ESH situation.", "You must\u2019ve missed the part where the OP tried to return the dress three different times and the mom refused. Mom is responsible for her own poor decisions. OP was not obligated to keep the dress."]}
