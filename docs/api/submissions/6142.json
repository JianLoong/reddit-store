They're an arsehole for not having that conversation and instead going for a punishment far exceeding the issue.", "Are u saying showing of ur boobs indicates low self esteem?", "Just because she is 18, doesn\u2019t mean her parents cannot intervene when she makes bad decisions. If she was a few months younger, would it make any difference? Though it\u2019s better to talk her through it, and a temporary ban.", "I don't want to be that person, but can you be charged with flashing your breasts? They aren't equivalent to a penis.  Where i live women can legally walk topless just like men can. Cause they are same as men nipples.", "This was my first thought too.  I have read too many stories dealing with something like this.", "What r the odds someone will report her, from op post we know her video was shared online", "Would it be different if she was a few months younger, let's say, the day before her birthday?", "Not to mention that videos like this could be enough to have scholarships or job offers revoked if they're found on the internet. All a college or employer has to say is that it \"doesn't fit their image\" and bye bye offer.", "Uhh, guys walk around without their t-shirt on all the time. Showing your boobs and showing your genitals is not comparable at all.", "Not only that, but these videos live forever. So this could come back to bite her five years from now\u2014 10 years from now. And at  18 year olds, although technically adults, lack the reasoning and decision making to understand the consequences long-term.", "Agreed. Her boobs, her rules.", "She's 18, she already is old enough to do what she wants \ud83d\ude02", "Have you never gotten a speeding ticket?", "OP is also the same parent that let her daughter party every weekend senior year to \"motivate her\" for school, so I'm not sure her judgement should be trusted, or that she is deserving of any respect.", "There is a chance op daughter goes NC with him", "yes the daughter is an adult but her brain isn\u2019t fully developed and OP is worried about their daughter. should she have banned parties? no. but she isn\u2019t being an AH for caring for her daughter", "This is an older school of thought. The reality is that most people have something somewhere on the internet that shows them in a less-than-favorable light. These videos, which would have been devastating and humiliating when I was 18 (I\u2019m 40 now), are going to be no big deal by the time OP\u2019s daughter begins her career.\n\nI remember when Bill Clinton was running for president and the whole smoked-but-didn\u2019t-inhale drama went down. I think I was 9. Can you imagine getting up in arms today if a political candidate had *gasp* been in the presence of marijuana? Time change. If OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s video is that big of a deal, I\u2019m guessing TikTok is going to single handedly bring down a lot of future career paths for most of gen Z.", "Meh. She is an adult. Stop being creepy.", "I mean thats just plain common sense right there.", "Showing your boobs indicates wanting attention = low self esteem/loneliness/personality disorder/jealousy", "Yes, yes it is. And it's painful to see how many of you don't understand this.", "Agreed.    Videos of her jumping topless into a swimming pool while drunk are going to complicate her future college and job applications.  I have known a couple of people over the years who really sabotaged their careers with this sort of silliness.", "My bad for some reason senior year went with 17 your right she's an adult now", "We judge people here on their actions, not their feelings.  In this case, instead of having a candid conversation like a grownup with their adult daughter, OP decided to treat her like she\u2019s 14.", "I'm not being creepy at all. It's very possible that people won't look fondly on that kind of video. I don't think that is a mature response, but plenty of people aren't. She is absolutely an adult, but I think it's fair to say that she still needs to abide by dad's rules as long as she lives in dad's house.\n\nDad can't force her to stay home, but his house, his rules. Granted, I think it would be more mature to simply discuss the consequences of ones actions and to say that dad would like for her to skip parties for a bit, but that obviously didn't happen. \n\nAs a side note on the creepy comment, we both know those guys weren't chanting \"flash\" because they believed in equal treatment of men and women in that moment, and I doubt that OP's daughter took her clothes off as an example of fighting the patriarchy. Acknowledgeding that those kids wanted to see OP's daughter naked isn't creepy, it's literally what happened. I don't blame OP for not wanting that to happen again, although nothing he can do can really stop it. That was my main point there.", "Pointing out real life consequences isn\u2019t being creepy.", "Judging from all these \"YTA because you should let her show her boobs whenever\", it seems like it's not obvious.", "You and everyone here wants attention.", "AGREED", "not like they are 14 but like they are a child who has a bright future ahead and is putting it at risk. if the video was shared via platforms like snapchat or instagram or was posted it could mean some really bad stuff. especially if there were minors there (probably were) shes looking out for her daughter", "You\u2019re absolutely right. \n\nWe all want attention. Thank you for your observation.", "Yes thus whatever you said about low self esteem, etc applies to everyone, you included.", "And you \ud83d\ude07", "Yes and you."]}
