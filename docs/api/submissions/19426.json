It would suck for your parents to drive a wedge between you two, and time spent together is more important than gifts anyway.

Sounds like she messed up and is a bit desperate.\n\nSurely a temporary compromise can be reached where your sister gets a present and you get one given back at a later date when money is less tight.\n\nFeels like an NAH.  Shit happens, nobody outwardly set out to do bad here. It's a big ask to you but might be worth it in the long run.", "ESH  Parents suck for not planning appropriately for both occasions. Don\u2019t know the circumstances, but you could be more gracious to your sister who now will have a shitty birthday. Maybe consider it a gift from you also?", "Not just failure to budget; but even to plan.", "Tend to agree, parents definitely suck, but OP you are an older sibling so act like it. People who say NTA, never had siblings or a good relationship with one. OP if this is how you want to treat your sister go for it, but don't expect much in return.", "Yup, I'm pretty sure she just forgot.", "Even better, go ahead and give her something along with \"I know mom forgot, but I didn't.\"", "She either *forgot* to buy your sister a gift, and only remembered  *after* giving you your gifts, \n\nOR maybe she wanted to show off?

Time to decide if being right is worth any relationship damage with your sister and mom (and it might be time to take a stand, I don\u2019t know your whole history.) Congratulations on your graduation. Hopefully you can get away and make better financial and personal decisions than you mom has.", "If you didn't ask for any of it, why do you care? Is putting your mother into a financial bind and letting your sister be disappointed worth standing on principle? Be a good sister and daughter and relinquish one of those gifts you didn't request anyway.", "NTA. She should've budgeted better or gotten you something different so she could afford both. Taking back your present to give to your sister is awful. She knew when your sister's birthday was and that she hadn't gotten her anything. Did she.give you the present planning to immediately take it away to give to her? I'm curious as to what her explanation of why she.gave you something she didn't intend to let you have.", "NTA, your mom should definitely have planned better. But, it would just be nice of you to share with your sister. Maybe do it anyway out of the kindness of your heart, not because you are under any obligation.", "Had your mother already given you the gift and wanted to take it back?\n\nTechnically, if your mother hadn't given you the gift yet, it wasn't yours.\n\nI'm just curious.\n\nGrowing up, we had a little one come to our house one Christmas Eve. My mom changed a name tag on a box from each of ours (my brother, my sister and I) and those gifts became that little girl's. They had never been ours. They were gifts our mother had bought.  They were not gifts someone else had sent for us.\n\nIf your mother hasn't given you the gift yet, it's technically and legally not yours.\n\nI'm only asking this for context.", "Shit happens, but your child's bday isn't some sudden unexpected event, the mom had a year to prepare a gift, so no money now shouldn't be a problem, especially a problem which another child is supposed to solve.", "This is sarcasm right? If you give someone a gift, then you can\u2019t just demand it back when it\u2019s convenient for you.", "How do you know OP is an older sibling?", "No it isn't. Unless mom is always irresponsible, give her a break. She tried to make her kid's graduation special and lost track of her budget. She doesn't want to disappoint her other daughter. What is the harm in helping out mom? I guess that no gift ever has been more important than my mother or my siblings."]}
