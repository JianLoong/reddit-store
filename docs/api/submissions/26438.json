It's not the gender of the individual that dicates that; its the situation, desired outcome, and any beliefs involved towards that.\n\nTypically women communicate less directly than men, but it doesn't indicate basing their decisions on emotion or reason. It's simply social conditioning and learned behavioural modeling aquired from role models.  \n\n\nIt has occured to me that this less direct communication style can be difficult for some people, those who are used to and employ more direct communication, to understand.  \n\n\nAgain, it's not entirely gender based, but most of it is learned from role models early in life. Some men use a more indirect style of communicating, and some women are very straight to the point with what they want to say.  \n\n\nexample:   \n\n\nIndirect communication: \"It would be nice if Francis could find somewhere to store her matress for a couple of weeks.
