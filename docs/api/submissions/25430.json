Lacey and Alison are super close, they share a room and everything. However, they dislike Carson because he always likes to pick on them. My wife is a SAHM and I get a day off on Sunday. Whenever I'm at work and Carson picks on Lacey or Alison, my wife usually does nothing and says 'boys will be boys'. \n\nWhenever I'm home, I try to punish my son, but the next day, my wife doesn't enforce it. I once told him he had to wash dishes for 2 days, and he did it the day when I was home, but the next day when I wasn't, my wife did them. \n\nOn Monday, my daughters were playing in their room while it was locked. Carson really hates being left out and so he started running into the door so they would let him in. They still wouldn't let him in though and kept on playing (they don't like playing with him because he always gets mad when he loses). He then got the keys that led to every room in the house in my wife and I's room (they were supposed to be hidden) and unlocked the door. My daughters were playing uno and Carson demanded they let him play too. When they said they didn't want to, my son got really mad and slammed shut the open laptop on Lacey's desk. He closed it with so much force that it stopped working.\n\nLacey was really upset and went downstairs to tell my wife. My wife then got mad at her and said it was her fault for not just letting Carson play with them. She also refused to buy her a new one. When I got home and my daughter told me the situation, I spoke with my wife and asked her what punishment she gave our son. She said none. I then discussed with her how we should punish him. My wife said that she thought he didn't need punishing because 'boys will be boys'. I told her that punishment was absolutely necessary and I suggested no electronics for 2 months. After some more back and forth, she reluctantly agreed. I then took the iPad and hid it in my car (My wife has her own car) so my wife couldn't just give it back the next day.\n\nWe then discussed getting my daughter a new laptop. My wife said that we shouldn't and that it would be a good punishment. I don't even think she did anything wrong, if they don't want to play with him, then they don't want to play. She'll also need a laptop for her schoolwork since school is starting soon.  My wife didn't agree, but I bought her a new laptop anyways. I bought it with my own money since we don't share finances. \n\nIt's been a few days now, and I've been getting texts from some of my inlaws saying the punishment towards my son was too harsh and that buying my daughter a new laptop made it worse. Lacey literally needs a laptop for her schoolwork, and if we don't punish our son then he'll never learn. So, AITA?

He was constantly running into the door and she did nothing. He took the keys and still she did nothing. And then he ruined a laptop and she still failed to do anything. \n\n2) You have a daughter problem. Yes, it\u2019s fine that they don\u2019t want to constantly play with their brother. But, you should try to find something that they can all do together so that everyone feels included. I\u2019m talking like one activity a day, not constant togetherness. \n\n3) you have a son problem. He\u2019s acting out and behaving poorly. You know this. Yes, there needs to be consequences. But, more than that, you need to figure out why. \n\nIt sounds like he\u2019s lonely and feeling left out and may be acting out in frustration. This is simply my opinion. But you need to figure it out so that it can be properly addressed. \n\nBuying a new laptop was the right thing to do. Consequences for your son was the right thing to do. Taking electronics makes sense. He ruined electronics and, as such, is showing that he\u2019s not old enough to handle them responsibly.", "Ok, let me just start off with saying, I HATE your wife and she is raising a horrible human being here.\n\nThis is  me blowing it way out of proportion (but this is a real possibility), but what if 10 years down the road your son R's someone, what will your wife say at his hearing to defend him. \"Boys will be boys\"?\n\nYou NEED to nip this in the bud right now.\n\nAnd you are NTA, your wife is. It may be time to reassess your relationship with your wife, not just for yourself, but for your daughters AND your son.", "NTA. Your wife is setting up your son for a lifetime of unhappiness by creating a spoiled, entitled prick of a man. I can't help but notice how gendered this all is and how your elder daughters are expected to be endlessly accommodating to his demands and are somehow at fault for his outbursts. Sounds like your wife also is foisting her supervision duties over her son on her daughters, which is also misogynistic and highly inappropriate. The inconsistency of your parenting styles also isn't helping your son at all, who is no doubt acting out because of that inconsistency.\n\nThis really isn't an issue with your children, as eight is a little too young to understand how he's being a little jerk, this is a wife issue. I think the punishment is a little harsh, as two months is a long time, and that you may be overcompensating for your wife treating him like a spoiled little prince. But I do agree that buying a new laptop for your daughter is the correct thing to do. Otherwise, she would technically be getting punished for doing nothing wrong and being the victim, which is only going to increase how much she and her sister resent your son and do not want anything to do with him.\n\nLike I said, I really think this is primarily a wife issue. She's definitely a Boy Mom^TM and is setting him and your daughters up for a lifetime of resentment and trauma. I definitely think this is serious enough to go to couple's therapy about. Your wife needs to have a come to Jesus about what harm her patriarchal parenting choices will inflict on her children, as well as the difficulties that you both have on getting on the same page and presenting a united front to your children.", "NTA. And you need to take a good hard look at what your wife is doing to your kids. She's raising your son to be an inconsiderate narcissistic golden child, and she's teaching your girls that they're second place with her and with the world at large.\n\nThe lion's share of their time is spent with her--who's message donyou think is more likely to sink in? Yours or hers?\n\nYou have wife problem", "Saying \"boys will be boys\" is just allowing unacceptable behavior.  The son can't take no for an answer and that could lead to a whole lot of problems in his future. Props to dad for trying to teach son that actions have consequences.  His sisters not wanting to play/spend time with him is the consequence of him picking on them consistently. Wife/mother is allowing this behavior from her son and it shows which child is clearly her favorite, which will eventually lead to resentment from your daughter's.", "NTA. Your wife is raising your son to be an entitled mean brat", "You and your wife are not on the same pages at all and you two really need to get on the same page (even if it's a middle of the road page neither of you are happy with).\n\nYou give consequences and she doesn't enforce them. She says kid shouldn't get a laptop and you do it anyway. You're fighting each *other*, how can you parent at the same time? ESH", "NTA, but man, you and your wife need to get on the same page before your son is ruined.", "I think you guys should do couselling to get on the same page. Try to agree on expectations that are the same for all three kids. It's not fair to pur your kids in the middle of your disagreements, and I promise they'll all how to manipulate you two in their teen years if you're clearly not united.", "NTA but somewhere between your 2 approaches might be a better approach. Maybe have structured or parent supervised play activities for all 3 of the kids. Yes it sounds like little brother is a pest, probably because his mom let's him be a little butt head, but it does suck being the odd one out alllllll the time. Maybe family game nights or something not competitive since he's the youngest and seems like he needs to learn how to interact with his sisters in a healthy way. So possibly crafts or having adventures that include everyone.\n\nHe for sure needs consequences and what you have proposed seems very appropriate considering the ages involved.", "NTA your wife is raising an entitled prick. Why do you think the two girls are close?", "NTA\n\nWhy is your wife so lenient with the son and not the daughters?  He sounds like a little hellion.", "The weird thing is that I'm used to hearing the dad or whatever saying it to cover for their kid and maybe justify whatever bullshit attitude they've had in the past. Here's it's OP, the dad, who wants to punish their son and the mom just trying to deflect it. Trust your husband to know how boys act and when they need some punishment.", "Parents who spout that crap, raise the Brock Turners of this world, and blame the victims. You have a wife problem, and need to fix it and fast, before what she is teaching him, is deep seated and turns into entitlement.", "Amen.", "It doesn't sound like they're mean-girling him. Sounds like he's a bully and people don't want to spend time with their bully.  The thing is they can't do better until he does better, because if not you're saying these girls should endure being teased by their brother and spend time with him anyway", "Seems like the reason the sisters don\u2019t want to play with Carson is because he picks on them, and gets upset if he looses. This all goes back to mom, the excuse \u201cboys will be boys\u201d is just letting him get away with his tantrums, so why would his sisters want to play with him. He faces no consequences, and he knows that! That would be a big reason to be excluded.", "Still, the way his wife justifies their sons behavior by saying \"Boys will be Boys\" isn't right. \n\nThe daughters could have played with him but it's not alright that their mother tolerates that the son destroyed the daughters property, blaming her for it. \n\nPlus, it seems as if he never actually get punished as the mom is always protecting him.", "I feel bad for the poor kid, keeps getting left out of his own family. \n\nThe parents need to teach Carson how to play nice and behave so he's included in these things, it's on them that he's hard to be around - but he's also only *8* years old and all he sees is being excluded.", "They exclude him because he behaves badly. That's a natural consequence.", "Do you socialize with everyone who wants you to? If someone asks you to do something with them, are you bullying them by saying no? Do you teach your daughters that they aren't allowed to say no to anyone who wants their time and attention?\n\nCarson needs to learn that he is not the center of the universe, and that if he wants to play with his sisters, he has to be nice to them, not throwing tantrums and breaking stuff if he doesn't get his way.", "How are they bullying him? He throws a fit when he loses, so they don't want to play with him. If Mom stepped up to help her son be a better person, maybe her daughters would be willing to spend time with him.", "Mom dotes on the boy.   Dad spoils the girl.  Story as old as time.  Living it.", "But as I just said in another comment, Dad is clearly Team Daughters, and that is the only side of the story we are getting. My biggest issue, and the real reason for my ESH, is that these parents seem to have chosen sides, and that feels pretty fucked up to me as a parent.", "I get that, but he\u2019s four years younger than the oldest. For me, though, more than anything, my issue is that the parents seem to have chosen sides, when it sounds like all the kids probably need to be held more accountable. All we see is Dad\u2019s view here, and he is clearly Team Daughters."]}
