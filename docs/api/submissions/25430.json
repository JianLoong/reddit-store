Lacey and Alison are super close, they share a room and everything. However, they dislike Carson because he always likes to pick on them. My wife is a SAHM and I get a day off on Sunday. Whenever I'm at work and Carson picks on Lacey or Alison, my wife usually does nothing and says 'boys will be boys'. \n\nWhenever I'm home, I try to punish my son, but the next day, my wife doesn't enforce it. I once told him he had to wash dishes for 2 days, and he did it the day when I was home, but the next day when I wasn't, my wife did them. \n\nOn Monday, my daughters were playing in their room while it was locked. Carson really hates being left out and so he started running into the door so they would let him in. They still wouldn't let him in though and kept on playing (they don't like playing with him because he always gets mad when he loses). He then got the keys that led to every room in the house in my wife and I's room (they were supposed to be hidden) and unlocked the door. My daughters were playing uno and Carson demanded they let him play too. When they said they didn't want to, my son got really mad and slammed shut the open laptop on Lacey's desk. He closed it with so much force that it stopped working.\n\nLacey was really upset and went downstairs to tell my wife. My wife then got mad at her and said it was her fault for not just letting Carson play with them. She also refused to buy her a new one. When I got home and my daughter told me the situation, I spoke with my wife and asked her what punishment she gave our son. She said none. I then discussed with her how we should punish him. My wife said that she thought he didn't need punishing because 'boys will be boys'. I told her that punishment was absolutely necessary and I suggested no electronics for 2 months. After some more back and forth, she reluctantly agreed. I then took the iPad and hid it in my car (My wife has her own car) so my wife couldn't just give it back the next day.\n\nWe then discussed getting my daughter a new laptop. My wife said that we shouldn't and that it would be a good punishment. I don't even think she did anything wrong, if they don't want to play with him, then they don't want to play. She'll also need a laptop for her schoolwork since school is starting soon.  My wife didn't agree, but I bought her a new laptop anyways. I bought it with my own money since we don't share finances. \n\nIt's been a few days now, and I've been getting texts from some of my inlaws saying the punishment towards my son was too harsh and that buying my daughter a new laptop made it worse. Lacey literally needs a laptop for her schoolwork, and if we don't punish our son then he'll never learn. So, AITA?

The inconsistency of your parenting styles also isn't helping your son at all, who is no doubt acting out because of that inconsistency.\n\nThis really isn't an issue with your children, as eight is a little too young to understand how he's being a little jerk, this is a wife issue. I think the punishment is a little harsh, as two months is a long time, and that you may be overcompensating for your wife treating him like a spoiled little prince. But I do agree that buying a new laptop for your daughter is the correct thing to do. Otherwise, she would technically be getting punished for doing nothing wrong and being the victim, which is only going to increase how much she and her sister resent your son and do not want anything to do with him.\n\nLike I said, I really think this is primarily a wife issue. She's definitely a Boy Mom^TM and is setting him and your daughters up for a lifetime of resentment and trauma. I definitely think this is serious enough to go to couple's therapy about.

You shouldn't give your daughter's hell about this but your son is obviously effected by being excluded. The fact he deals with it in a toxic manner, a toxic manner which is encouraged or at least not discouraged by your wife, needs addressed but equally the kid clearly is hurt by being excluded.

He has feelings too and those shouldn't be ignored just to placate his siblings.\n\nSo here's my question: Have you ever considered sitting down with your girls and talking with them about how they're treating Carson? Ask them how they would feel if someone kept doing that to them. Then ask all three what can be done between the three of them to make things better.

And for your wife to punish your daughter (I guess just one of them?) by denying her a new laptop is very wrong.  She's teaching her daughters to give in to forceful, demanding males.  You have a serious parenting problem with your wife.   Your in-laws need to butt out.  \n\nI think you also need to help your son.  He probably feels lonely, and that's probably why your wife favors him.  A therapist may help.  Good luck.", "NTA - but you have a wife problem.", "Your wife is an asshole who really needs to check on herself. How can you live with a person like this who does partiality based on gender ? Ask her to improve or leave her because it could negatively effect your daughters and your son could end up becoming worse. Seriously brother.", "NTA.

What it really means is boys, when together with other boys, will do dumb dangerous stuff because they thought it was funny. Not hurt other people/their stuff.

OP is at least setting the expectation that poor behavior like mistreating siblings has consequences, but it sounds like no one is actually teaching Carson appropriate behaviors to replace the inappropriate ones.

I thought I was the only one not just screaming \"your son is an asshole\"\n\nThe kid is 8, he needs boundaries and consequences but if he feels left out and excluded he will act out (like any kid would, male or female) so bringing the family together and engaging in the right ways will make it better for everyone, the son and the daughters and help them have a happier and better family life together.\n\nThe amount of people in here, about an 8 year old kid, saying \"he is horrible\" \"he is brat\" \"he will grow up to be X, Y or Z\" is sickening.

There are ways to engage a kid, help a kid, channel their energy and improve them. Writing a kid off at 8 year old is fucking shameful behaviour and quite frankly abysmal parenting.

Pff, a lack of a father figure probably influences his shitty behaviour.\n\nThis is not, in any way, saying his behaviour is acceptable.

If your wife is responsible for enforcing the punishments she needs to agree with them. You seem to always take the girls side and mom always the boys.

I thought I was the only one not just screaming \"your son is an asshole\"\n\nA lot of people have no other model of parenting than punishments and (sometimes) rewards.\n\nAnd sure, that's often part of parenting.

I think the parents need to be proactive in doing things together that include everyone. \n\nBut I also think they should also be allowed to play without them as well. The parents need to fix it.

She\u2019s the one that is okay with them playing together all the time (which she should absolutely allow them to play together), but she\u2019s actually ignoring all her kids in the process.

Mom is a lazy parent re discipline, she just doesn\u2019t wanna deal with it so girls get the \u2018natural\u2019 punishment of whatever their brother does and she decides \u2018boys will be boys\u2019.

Doing everything for him and not correcting him is doing him no favours. She sounds like a future JNMIL. Your daughters will resent the favouritism if this isn't sorted out.

What\u2019s the next thing he does when he tries to break in because he feels entitled to play (and win) something? He needs to learn that he can\u2019t just get what he wants by force, and be punished for breaking an expensive piece of electronics.\n\n\nAlso, he has his own room, but the girls are still sharing? I bet that\u2019s also a point of frustration. They may get along, but the oldest is definitely going to want more privacy. Sounds like the brother is mom\u2019s favorite and he just runs roughshod while she claims it\u2019s boys being boys, then tries to punish the girls for\u2026not wanting to include someone who picks on them and flips out if he loses a game? I mean, clearly I think the mom is the biggest issue, but she needs to think about the consequences of letting him grow up thinking he CAN get what he wants, breaking and entering is fine, and I\u2019m sorry but ramming a door physically is pretty violent. OP needs to take the kid to a psychologist/therapist. This could be a mental health disorder, but it could also be just him thinking he should get what he wants and mom enabling it.
