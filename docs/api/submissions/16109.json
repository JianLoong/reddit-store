Being with someone who is struggling mentally is challenging, and it does require some sacrifices, but honestly this sacrifice is pretty trivial stuff (as much as I hate his chosen show, I can't say I have watched enough of it to rule it out as a valid coping tool). I have to sit through some enormous tripe when my husband's struggling because if he is genuinely relaxed then I am happy because I know it means he is in a healthier head space.

I can't fully explain why but I think one of the reasons re-watching sitcoms helps with anxiety is because they are very predictable. \n\nI hope the boyfriend in this post is okay.
