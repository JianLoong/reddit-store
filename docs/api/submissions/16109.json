Being with someone who is struggling mentally is challenging, and it does require some sacrifices, but honestly this sacrifice is pretty trivial stuff (as much as I hate his chosen show, I can't say I have watched enough of it to rule it out as a valid coping tool). I have to sit through some enormous tripe when my husband's struggling because if he is genuinely relaxed then I am happy because I know it means he is in a healthier head space.

Some shows are pure therapy, it may sound crazy to outsiders, but it\u2019s 100% true.", "As silly as it sounds, repeatedly binge watching Lucifer got me through my father\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s and death.  It\u2019s a happy enough show that you can just let it roll over you.  But it also runs on the philosophy that we create our own hell through our own grief and guilt. You have the power to get yourself out. And I found that whole idea very comforting.", "My corny show for this is LOST.

People need to stop self diagnosing. It's not accurate,  and leads to misunderstanding and misinformation. \n\nAnxiety is not 'being anxious' or as simple as having easily defined triggers that cause you to be anxious, such as your mentioned ADHD. I have diagnosed by a professional GAD, Generalised Anxiety Disorder, and it is hell at times. \n\nIt's literally living life on the constant edge of fight, flight, freeze, being stuck in hypervigilance, but having no reason why. The adrenaline is constantly pumping, you are always aching because you are tensed to run. Walking to the shop to buy milk becomes an hour long activity because you need to make sure you have loose change, and a back up payment,  you get to the door and you can't breathe it's like a brick wall is in your chest and glue is in your ears, you can't go outside.  You don't know why, you. Just. Can't. \n\nMaybe today's a good day. Maybe today you get past the sobbing and hyperventilating,  you don't throw up or sweat through your jumper, you manage to get to the shop. If your lucky you won't have a panic attack. No hyperventilating or quiet tears or panic when the cashier talks to you. No frantic punching at the buttons on the self serve because you don't know if it always does this or oh my god what if I broke it, I literally cannot afford to replace it, this is too much and the managers seen me.....I'm sweating and feeling dizzy, that horrible glue feeling is back and I need to sit down.\n\nThat's just an hour long trip to get a couple pints of milk with GAD. Diagnosed anxiety. By a professional.  \n\nIt's a different beast to 'getting a bit anxious so i have anxiety'. People can have anxiety or panic attacks,  yes , without suffering from anxiety.  I wouldn't wish this on anyone. I  really hate this self dx trend currently,  it can take years for accurate diagnoses. \n\nIf you are suffering,  please please see a doctor. There are so many ways to help. I promise. Its taken me a whole but I've manage it a lot better.", "Sure, everyone gets anxious and its easy to realize that.

Don't think the examples you're using are in any way an equivalent to anything I said, and I don't feel like we're even talking about the same thing.\n\nI never talked about prioritizing his pain over date night. I said that was making the DATE night about him having anxiety (not him *being in pain at the moment*) instead of about having a date. It means exactly what is written and I'm not sure how I could even explain it better.\n\nAnd you seem to be addressing what I already addressed in my first paragraph. Why do you jump to \"he would prefer being curled up but was strong enough to go to date night despite being in tremendous pain\"? Like... That's what I'm saying. If he was having a mental health emergency then, then OF COURSE OP would be an AH for not caring. But it doesn't sound like that's what happened at all. It merely sounds like he was having a regular day in the life of someone who happens to have general anxiety and still wanted to use this as an excuse to watch only what he likes, guilt tripping his gf in the process.\n\nWe're not basing our reflection on the same premises so of course we're not understanding each other and not coming to the same conclusion.

If you haven't already, I highly recommend downloading it!", "I am back on it at the moment, lost count of how many times I have watched it but honestly some episodes still have me in tears. Very good for some emotional release.", "Yeah I agree .

This is because I have very fond memories of watching it with my dad as a kid. No sitcom elicits the same feelings of comfort for me. Either way I\u2019m joining the NAH verdict, this is just something you should have an adult conversation about. Maybe move date night to a night when the show isn\u2019t on? Or move it to the afternoon when he maybe has less anxious feelings? I feel like this could be resolved easily with just one conversation.", "No offence, but that\u2019s a super privileged take. \n\nPeople using their various issues as an excuse to be an asshole is the problem. Not self-diagnosis. Surprise surprise, people looking for an excuse to be an asshole and some kind of get-out-of-criticism-free card have clued in to the fact that growing awareness of mental health issues means it\u2019s handy to diagnose yourself. Also, a lot of people self-diagnose and are also assholes because they\u2019re both very common and not mutually exclusive.\n\nComplaining about self diagnosis when you\u2019re really annoyed about assholes being assholes is the same as complaining about milk being sold in the supermarket because your abusive parent used to make you drink milk.\n\n\nAlso, from your comment it seems like your problem isn\u2019t self-diagnosis but lay people (not psychologists or psychiatrists) confusing the emotion \u201canxiety\u201d and the actual psychological disorder, or confusing the human instinct for tidiness and cleanliness with actual OCD.

It's not like it hurts anyone to journal their thoughts or make to do lists because they're forgetful or whatever other strategies exist because the strategies themselves are symptom focused anyway, and not diagnose specific.\n\nThe doctors help with diagnosis and connecting you with tools, strategies and medication so go and see them.

But anxiety, like depression and many other mental health issues are a clinical diagnosis, they simply ask you some questions, you answer them and you get diagnosed based on your answers to a few questions. The exact same questionnaires they use at the docs are all over the internet. You don't need a PHD to diagnose anxiety, only to medicate it. Source: diagnosed and medicated GAD sufferer, married to a diagnosed and medicated depressive and parent to a child who is diagnosed but not medicated with social and separation anxiety with leanings towards OCD. All of us were initially \"diagnosed\" by me and in the case of my husband I urged him to see the doctor for further support, in the case of my daughter I made her the appointment to get access to childhood support. The GP just did the exact same thing as I did to confirm the diagnoses before writing prescriptions and/or referring onwards. And my husband and I knew we were struggling and were finding our own management techniques long before we resigned ourselves to doctors whose only resolution is medication. You only go to the docs when you can no longer manage it with lifestyle choices and self administered coping mechanisms like breathing techniques, meditation or otherwise, because the only thing they can really offer is pills, which not everyone wants.", "100 percent agree", "Make it billions of choice if you want.
