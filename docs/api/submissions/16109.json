Being with someone who is struggling mentally is challenging, and it does require some sacrifices, but honestly this sacrifice is pretty trivial stuff (as much as I hate his chosen show, I can't say I have watched enough of it to rule it out as a valid coping tool). I have to sit through some enormous tripe when my husband's struggling because if he is genuinely relaxed then I am happy because I know it means he is in a healthier head space.

I'm also a mental health support worker, I learned counseling skills but I'm not a counselor/therapist.

Also OP wrote that he said he really needed it at the moment\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s because English is not my first language but for me prioritizing his mental health over the date night and making the date night about his anxiety is the same thing?

(Did you know that the formal name for an ear, nose, and throat doctor is an otorhinolaryngologist? My parents, who were both doctors, taught me from around age three to tell that to adults who asked what I wanted to be when I grew up.) \n\nIn my teens and twenties i was unable to form an emotional connection with other people in normal ways, so I attempted to do it in the way I was taught, by info dumping regarding my current interests. But most people don't want to hear a 30-minute discourse on crewed space flight or the epidemiology of polio. It took a lot of therapy to learn how to be a person instead of a resource library. \n\nWatching Sheldon and the way he relates to his friends and the way he is ridiculed to the audience was very triggering for me. I couldn't watch it, no matter how much anyone else benefitted from it.", "Researching what may be going on with you and trying advice you find as result is not diagnosing yourself with a problem.

I think again, our two different premises change the meaning of this sentence. I supposed he was doing pretty much fine, so making a regular date night about him having anxiety in general, and having crises at other times.

Mine literally told me I couldn't afford him anymore.\n\nIf I tell you that I have a problem with anxiety, so I have comfort objects at home and I put on certain researched music that helps me, is that self-diagnosis?\n\nListen, I don't care much for semantics. Oversharing is a bad thing in the wrong context, absolutely. Telling your SO that you're struggling is actually not bad at all. Planning a date night for them when you actually need self-care is probably a bad move, though. I don't doubt that OP's boyfriend genuinely has an issue, though. Who watches TBBT? Lol.

You're just making a distinction between this most common form of \"self diagnosis\" and your own personal definition of it, which involves making demands and being a dick, to justify your \"all self-diagnosis is bullshit and harmful\" take. It's like the no true scotsman fallacy - you're saying \"I have decided that all self diagnosis is bullshit, so if you show me an example that's *not* bullshit then that obviously doesn't count as self-diagnosis\".\n\nFor the record, I self-diagnosed with autism before I was able to get an official diagnosis, and my wife did the same with her ADHD. Neither of us presented them to others as factual set-in-stone diagnoses - if it came up, it was in the form of \"I suspect that I might have...\" or \"I share some traits with people who have...\", but personally in our own minds we were pretty certain, and we were both right as eventually confirmed by doctors. (I was diagnosed with autism years before we met and she has only just had her ADHD diagnosis, we weren't going through this at the same time.) My wife is from a country where mental health care is still not very widespread and she would never have been able to get officially diagnosed while living there, so if she hadn't moved here then she would have had to stay self-diagnosed forever - it wouldn't have made it any less accurate though!", "But he *is* self-soothing, which is huge! Not everybody can identify what helps them and it can quickly lead to a spiral. He should work with a professional to develop his tools, yes.

The post is probably not clear enough", "She also states hes been using his comfort show lately which implies its been frequent. He had one night of compromise.", ">I have had multiple panic attacks in public from anxiety.\n\nUnless a professional told you this, then you don't know that. It may not have even been a panic attack. Lots of people think they had one when something else actually happened. I understand not being able to afford medical care, but you don't know for sure until you seek help. If you're never able to do so, guessing is fine. But that's what it is- guessing. And no offense, but if it's so serious that it requires a label, you'll end up in the hospital with a diagnosis regardless in the end anyway. Panic attacks in public can only happen so often until an ambulance or the police get called. Anyway, I'm not even talking about the post. My comment was purely about the self-diagnosis thing. The misinformation that spreads around because we have random people acting like authorities on subjects they've purely learned about via WebMD is a genuine issue, as are the stereotypes and casualty people start to see these conditions with as a result.", "Suspecting that something might be up, and seeking actual help, isn't self-diagnosis. Idk where people got this stupid idea.", "Self soothing is not good when it's being used maladaptively or being preferred over more effective techniques like in this case", "That doesn't mean he's forcing her to watch it regularly. \n\n>He had one night of compromise.\n\nYou mean he had one night where he should have done what she wanted instead?

I'm just helping myself and learning about things that keep me a lot more functional. That's not contributing to any misinformation or casual stuff.\n\nWho are you to say that I do or do not require a label? What helps me is for me to decide. That's why I'm responding to your comment here. Sometimes what people do for their own self-care and improvement, and the tools they use, are way too personal for you to be judging so harshly.

It might have nothing do with his label or his problem, which I personally would agree is genuine.", "It could have just as easily been \"I need to go for a walk\" and OP may not have wanted to go for a walk. A walk is a more healthy technique than watching tv, but maybe not as effective in **his** case. Hard to know without all the facts/his history.", "If they live together and regularly watch his comfort show, shes already compromising. I have a lot of anxiety and I am the boyfriend in this scenario. My husband regularly watches greys anatomy with me when Im having a hard time. Occasionally he gets tired of it (completely understandable) and I have him pick a movie instead. I often dont like the movie, but he doesnt like greys so its a compromise."]}
