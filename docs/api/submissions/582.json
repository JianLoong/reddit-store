I understand you want to hold on to a relationship with your dad in spite of his failure to protect you or your boundaries, but I would strongly suggest meeting with him on neutral territory, i.e., restaurant, museum, or such.  If mom tags along to that, then you'll need to tell him no more contact until he stops helping her torture you.", "To be honest, sadly you may have to Put your dad on information diet. Everything you tell him may get to her. I know this behaviour from my own so called mother i am NC for over 5 years. She will try and try again. Every information she get's will be used against you.

If you went NC, why would you speak to her and then ask your dad if you were a b*tch?  The moment you heard her coming up the stairs was the moment to leave.", "Thank you for your wisdom. He was largely unaware of what I was going through as a kid. When I told him later in life I could see it hurt him so badly. My sister moved 4 hours away as soon as she could and we haven't seen her in atleast 5 years. He knows how bad our family dynamic is and he blames himself partially for it but also just doesn't understand why my mom grew up so resentful of her parents but then turned out to be just as awful. I mostly feel sorry for him because he refuses to sever those ties and honestly he's the only person keeping her alive. She had a heart attack and he demanded she go to the hospital, she had a severe fall from a horse resulting in tons of broken bones and a TBI which be nursed her through, he drives her to all her appointments and helps her around her house. Yet she'd turn around and complain to me that no one helps her and she hadn't seen my dad in \"weeks\" when a) she fucked off and bought herself a separate house to \"escape him\" and b) he's over there all the time doing things for her.", "I tried this the last time he and I had plans to get together. He told her and she found an excuse to be at his house too at the exact same time. He said no matter what my mother says I'm always welcome in his home but he can't control when she is and isn't there. I also worry that if I took a line against being there the same time as her that she'd take it as a power play and would just come over and effectively end my night with my dad any time she wanted.", "I think so. Without a doubt every time I was over in the past before NC she would come sit down to watch the shows dad and I like and would critique them or object to the content. Or just plan come and hover in the door to have a conversation with dad which causes him to pause the show. She literally has no reason to be over there even except that as she screamed at me during the NC conversation her name is on \"this house too\". She literally fucked off and bought herself a whole house. Why is she constantly at his??", "My birthday is next month. This was an impact full comment.", "Thank you friend", "He sounds like someone who has good intentions, but make no mistake - if he was present at all, he absolutely knew what was going on in your childhood. You're kidding yourself if you actually think he was \"largely unaware.\" He was an adult responsible for your wellbeing and he chose NOT to do what was right. He *should* blame himself for his part in your family dynamic. From the little you have said, it's clear she was abusing him as well (and still is), which deserves a bit of sympathy. Still, he is allowed to choose that abuse for himself, but he should never have chosen that for you and your sister. Your mother was/is responsible for her toxic traits, but he actively chose not to give you a safe place from that.\n\nYou deserve to be safe from her abuse now, and yet he feels you are still someone whose happiness should be sacrificed at the altar of your mother's demons. He has no right to be disappointed in you when you don't engage with her. You deserve to live a happy life, away from people who make you miserable - even if those people include your mother. Because the fact that this cruel person is your mother means that you never lived a single moment of your life before you were under her thumb. That's SO MUCH worse than if you had met her as an adult.\n\nThis is turning in to a bit of a rant, so I will stop here. Just remember that you deserve to have peace in your life, and you are allowed to define what that means, guilt free. Don't ever doubt your right to set boundaries. I'm wishing you all the good things you deserve, OP.", "Then see your dad by inviting him to your place and you can avoid the unwelcome intrusion of a toxic human. Your dad seems to be displaying a strangely low sense of control over his own house.", "She wants to be the center of attention and likely wants to be begged to return.  She sounds toxic af.", "I choose not to own a TV \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut I get what you're saying. I get super anxious having people in my house feeling like I need to entertain them and not knowing what to do with myself and either feeling like I'm doing too much or too little.", "Buy a tv and have your dad over. He\u2019s not a guest he\u2019s your family and you\u2019re not expected to entertain him, just spend mom free time with him just as you want to do at his home. \n\nI\u2019m the meantime, find a therapist to help you through all of this. I\u2019m the child of a toxic mom and therapy has been a lifesaver. I only regret not going sooner."]}
