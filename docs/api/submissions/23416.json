She will constantly let you down and your sister sounds horrible. A 6 year old needs to understand her aunt has autism?! GTFO. \n\nYou protector yourself and her from your mom and sister. You protect your daughter from what is needed and she does NOT need your pathetic excuse of a mother. Grandmas are not all blood and can be replaced by someone better.", "My sister is 18 and high functioning. She's been raised like the rest of us save for her medical issues but she's not incapable of doing things for herself and my brother works full time hes 23 and lives in a different town than any of us.", "I'm not going NC but definitely LC until my anger can subside.

While the first may be more desirable than the second neither are wrong. Just like children aren't obligated to make their parents grandparents, parents aren't obligated to be Christmas cutter varied grandparents either. It is your child, no one else is obligated to this kid but you.\n\nAs for your sisters post ... She's an adult, why is your mother responsible for another adults actions? She agreed it is disrespectful but again your sister isn't obligated to find your child fun to be around and ppl with autism often find young, loud children difficult. \n\nI'm sorry you had issues with your paternal relatives and I get this isn't the relationship you want you mother to have with her grandchild, however just because you want the cookie cutter grandmother for your daughter doesn't mean your mum needs to fill that mould.", "story is unclear", "I was confused as well.
