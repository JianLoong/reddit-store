See the \u201cRock\u201d is that you are being made uncomfortable\u2026physically\u2026then gaslit about its severity in your place of work, with direct visual approval from the boss and no other recourse within the company. The \u201cHard Place\u201d is that this is likely your livelihood on the line, and this can escalate to you unjustly losing your job. I do not envy your position in the slightest. Your best course of action I think is to test the waters. Try and talk with the guy and your boss about it, separately, and privately (but in a safe open area) to gauge reactions. If they are less then agreeable, run. We have to many horror stories of this kind of unchecked stuff escalating. It aint worth the risk. BUT I imagine youll get some mealy mouth half ass sorry not sorry, maybe be ostracized a little as the \u201cno fun\u201d person, but otherwise get your way, no touching and keeping your job. Again, no real good moves here unless you have opportunities elsewhere. The guys are being assholes but the wife reaction makes sense, like\u2026.that wasnt a great move on your part? I get why you did it but its not gonna come off the way you intended. Shouldnt be a huge deal but we all know how people can be. Hopefully cooler heads prevail and they understand not to put their hands on people when they say so.

She may not, for whatever reason, want to admit it to herself even, so she lashed out at you instead. Maybe coming from a place of concern and not starting with \"I don't appreciate your husband.....\" because that can come off like you're blaming her for his behavior. Obviously you weren't but I can see how she would take it that way if she was indeed already emotionally worn down. When you see her in person, if she brings it up or if you feel comfortable bringing it up with her just clarify you didn't want to start anything with her just that you felt violated by the whole situation and she was the only person you felt you could contact about his behaviour. If the conversation doesn't go downhill you could maybe segue into asking if she's ok but that's tricky territory. I personally would make a report about him to management so they can bar him from entering workplace at least (hopefully) and if they don't anything my next stop would be the labor authority in your area and file a complaint. If you don't want to do that then I'd probably find a new job because it'll be hard avoiding him when he comes around and just approaches you.", "You need to make a big deal out of it. You need to call out your boss and let him know that you don't appreciate his friends getting physical with you and assaulting you at your workplace.
