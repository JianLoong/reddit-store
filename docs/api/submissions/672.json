Since we are in a long distance relationship she can't just come over to cheer me up. I told her I wasn't feeling the best and she started blaming herself for my unhappiness and repeatedly asked if it's because of her of if she had done something to which I said no. I didn't reply a lot and when I did it was just short replies.\n\nSo after things cleared up a little she confronted me about why I haven't told her I love you the past few days and why changed. She said I don't love her anymore because I was being so cold and we kinda argued about it and I told her multiple times that I love her a lot and tried comforting her.\n\nShe didn't really believe me and kept arguing against me (I felt absolutely dumbfounded being told how I am feeling when I am not feeling that way). So to confirm I am not crazy I sent a few screenshot of the convo to a close friend and talked about that because evidently the discussion with my gf wasn't going anywhere at all and I like hearing outside opinions.\n\nUnfortunately I fucked up and sent the message I was supposed to send to my friend to my GF and she felt violated to say the least. She doesn't want me to share things happening in OUR relationship with other people and I am a huge asshole for it. So Reddit, AITA for sharing a private conversation?  \n\n\nTLDR: Felt like I was treated in a wrong way during an argument with gf and didn't get anywhere when talking about it with her. Reached out to a friend to get advice and gf found out and felt betrayed.
