He was big on consent. He was not entitled back then. \n\nUnfortunately, the onset of his genetic anxiety disorder set in around 25 years old.

I tried to be supportive. \n\nWell, using booze to remedy his nerves because it\u2019s cheaper than therapy sessions, led to addiction. Alcoholism changed his personality, as it does with many people. Logic and responsibility go out the window. His dignity was replaced with entitlement. His work ethic was replaced with half-assed completion. His pride for independence was replaced with using others. This I learned these are alcoholic AFTER I dumped him. \n\nWhile I was heartbroken about it, I had to accept things turned out the way they did, that I became a co-dependent in the relationship and eventually came to my senses. \n\nAs for bad boys, I\u2019ve only dated two people in my life. No, I don\u2019t see the appeal in bad boys. I wanted to be a supportive partner and spouse. I wanted to be empathetic to the hardships of others. I wanted to be a good wife one day. That\u2019s how I loved him. \n\nFor co-dependency, the 3 C\u2019s to addiction are this:\n\nI didn\u2019t cause it, I can\u2019t control it, and I can\u2019t cure it. \n\nI am not responsible for his behavior or how he treated me. He projected his insecurity onto me because he wouldn\u2019t face his demons. It has nothing to do with me, or at least I think. I threw the kitchen sink at him and it wasn\u2019t good enough. And he treats those who do the most for him, the worst. He even admitted it.

There's no listing for \"alcoholism\" in the DSM-4 or DSM-V.

It destroys more alcoholics than anything else. From it stem all forms of spiritual disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually sick.\"  \n\nTradition 5: \"Alcoholics Anonymous can be likened to a group of physicians who might find a cure for cancer, and upon whose concerted work would depend the answer for sufferers of this disease.\"\n\n> That was the last time I saw him be\u2026 him. Cognizant, accountable, and prepared.  \n\nAnd this is still during your second trimester. So right after his diagnosis from a medical doctor and a prescription for an SSRI, he suddenly decided that alcohol was the real cure for what ails him.  \n\nAnd this whole time it's more important for you to find out AITA about a CREDIT CARD rather than something related to, oh say, your own child you had with him.\n\nSigh. You're not a bad storyteller, but you don't know enough about anxiety disorders or alcoholism to make it believable. Write about what you know about.\n\nB-", "You can choose to be petty. It's within your right but where does it get you? Does it make you a better person? Does it set a good example for your kid?  Do you think your ex is going to learn anything from it? If the answer is no to ask these things then it is either simply wasted venom or it is destructive.", "All 3/4 Credit Bureaus", "Oh shit that actually makes a lot of sense. I bet he would do something petty like that.", "He always told me his ex\u2019s were \u201ccrazy\u201d and I\u2019d have to ask for specifics. \n\nSadly, sexist remarks started to bleed into our relationship. \u201cAll women are double standards,\u201d this and that. And I\u2019m sitting here thinking, \u201cdo you observe your behavior at all?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll likely refer to me as the selfish, stupid. controlling, manipulative, stuck-up, money hungry ex because clearly me busting my ass for a secure job, healthcare benefits for our child, and paying 3/4 childcare fees means all I care about is money. Then again, he DID want to claim our son on his taxes next year so we could get \u201cwelfare benefits.\u201d Honestly, he was tired of owning anything to the IRS year after year while filing \u201csingle.\u201d Never mind me who pays for overhead, insurance, rent, utilities, groceries, and everything else \ud83d\ude44 \n\nHe wanted to contribute every little and get all the benefits. \n\nI don\u2019t file head of household and multiple forms of income because it sounds nice, that\u2019s for sure.", "Ha!! One of the things he said to me when I told him I had enough was, \u201cyou\u2019ll never find anyone better,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m taking my TV. I don\u2019t want you to have it.\u201d\n\nAll the mf had to do was treat me well. I wasn\u2019t a homie-hopper, but he was always paranoid I was doing sketchy shit behind his back.", "If he had been some rando off the street, you wouldn\u2019t have put up with it. But it wasn\u2019t just a random person, it was someone you built a relationship with, thus your brain is wired to trust them, believe that they would never treat you as badly as they treated that poor SOB they victimized. We want to feel like we\u2019re the exception because\u2026 we ought to be, right? I would stand up to anyone outside my family. But when it comes to my family, they\u2019re who I want to treat best and give lenience to, as I\u2019ve known them all my life. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not always a two way street and abusers treat their family the worst. They do everything backwards - are cordial in public and demonic in private. \n\nAnd when we love someone, we overlook their flaws. I\u2019m not perfect, so why would I judge him, right? Turns out there\u2019s varying degrees of flaws and \u201cimperfect\u201d turns into \u201cdegenerate\u201d along the way.\n\nI can gladly say I gave it my all, I loved hard, supported as much as I could, forgave as much I could, until the breaking point. That\u2019s all.", "My intention with closing the accounts was boosting my credit and cutting lose ties with an ex. \n\nIt was not to strike revenge or get back at him. I said I paid the remaining balance, right? That\u2019s neither petty nor venomous. I took one for the team and was accountable for MY credit card account. \n\nNot sure what you\u2019re getting at with those red herrings. I didn\u2019t do anything TO him - he\u2019s the one that claims it was pettiness, not me.\n\nAlso, my ex is near 30 years old. I\u2019m not here to teach him anything or be the better person because he\u2019s not my responsibility. I\u2019m here to protect myself.", "And close your windows...", "Yup that\u2019s straight out of the gaslighting playbook. You def deserve better.", "I wholeheartedly agree. I know I gave this relationship my all and I was there for him for far longer than he deserved. I loved him and fought for our marriage. No matter how much he twists the narrative and how much of a villain he's painting me, I know what really went down. I have accepted that I will not convince him otherwise and I'm finally ok with that.\nI'm well on my way to healing and I can see how he struggles. I honestly wish him healing in the future, if for nothing else then for our daughters sake, i do not wish for her to lose a relationship with her father", "I never said that closing the account was petty. It was the responsible and reasonable thing to do. As was notifying people who have cards in the account.", "My son is two years old, the same age I was when my biological parents split for the last time. Unfortunately, I do have memories of the screaming, yelling, and crying \ud83d\ude1e \n\nI hope my son has minimal recollection as I already have remorse for allowing the exposure come this far into his life.", "It\u2019s not his card on the account. It\u2019s my card and my account. If he had any sense of dignity, he wouldn\u2019t be trying to use my resources after I dumped him.", "You don't have to repeat that over and over. I read it in the OP. Your ex is an asshole and irresponsible as fuck. You cancelled the card which is appropriate. You then didn't tell him so that he would try to use it. You took that action for no positive reason, just to be mean to him. There is no price to come out of your action. (more specifically, your infection). Hopefully a you grow you'll come to discover that revenge or hurting someone just because they hurt you is not really worth your time and you'll spend energy trying to make the world a better place rather than adding to the pain \n\nThen you came here asking people what they think of your actions and then don't accept what people think. If you don't really want to know.", "I don't know what kind of Turkish Delight your friends have had, but the ones my family got were really good. We found a great one on Amazon from a company called Cerea Pazari, and it's really good.  I tried some other companies that weren't as good.", "There was plenty of positive reason - to boost my credit and cut off lose ends. That is very positive to me, in fact me closing my line of credit was about ME, not him. However, both you and him seem hellbent that I\u2019m out for revenge by committing an act of financial responsibility. \n\nHow is that mean to him? You haven\u2019t explained that one. \n\nAccept what people think? No, I\u2019m allowed to clarify my actions and intentions, should it be necessary or if I see someone like you twisting the story. \n\nYes, please elaborate on my \u201cinfection\u2026\u201d you\u2019ve got a good fan-narrative going on here and I need to see the moral of it.", "As a kid watching the animated (mini)series (1980s), I had no clue there was any Christian perspective at all.", "Thanx", "The BBC version wasn't a movie, it was a Sunday tea-time mini-series in the 80s - it was an awesome adaptation, with the extra time available from being a mini-series it allowed for much more of the detail from the book to be included. They also did The Borrowers, and 5 Children and It - BBC Sunday tea-time mini-series for kids in the 80s were awesome!!!", "I studied theology a bit as a teen and young adult.  It's very noticeable when you've studied it a bit. But as a kid, it went right over my head.", "He did. The CGI holds up really well for the first movie.", "I'll have to look into those. Sounds interesting.  I only have the faintest of memories of the BBC version."]}
