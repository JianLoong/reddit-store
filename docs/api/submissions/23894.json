Dude doesn't get to ask for decency when he isn't decent himself.", "NTA Very smart move. Did he expect to buy the equipment on your account?", "[removed]", "Nope", "if the account was only in your name, definitely NTA!  he could have wracked it up and you'd have been on the hook.  \n\n\ni've had a narcissistic ex get all huffy with me because i wouldn't let them take a phone that was in my name that they used while we were together.   same exact \"whine whine, i can't have it even though i think it should be mine\" attitude.  \n\n\ni blocked him.   and that's the best advice i'll give you for your situation.", "NTA  What a sad state of affairs.  Another single mother, although it sounds like you'll be able to support yourself and the child.  He probably won't be much of a co-parent if one at all.  I'm glad you cut him off, please protect yourself as the other commentors have said.  Good luck to you and the child.", "Loool NTA I had an ex who had 2 kids with a chick. He had them 90% of the time, but she still claimed the full ccb every month (canadian, a good 6-800 a month for 2 kids at that age that year) and made him pay for the full daycare cost. So I let him use my family's netflix account.\n\nHe dumped me, I logged out of all devices and changed the password, and he blew up my phone calling me selfish, \"how could I do this to his kids\" boy look at your baby mama first. Haha never been so grateful to have been dumped in my life \ud83e\udd23", "NTA.\n\nWhat on earth did he think you\u2019d do? Continuing to support a hobby that has absolutely no bearing on the shared commitment of child raising? Yeah nah. He\u2019s a delusional bully.", " NTA. Hold the line! Your limit is more than reasonable", "NTA and he's gross. Good for you.", "NTA. It\u2019s your cc. You don\u2019t owe him any heads up.", "Nta, nothing wrong with tying up loose ends", "Wait ...\n\nOkay ... no ... just a second ...\n\nAll right, I'm done laughing.\n\nNTA. Tell him to find another person to mooch off of, and start pulling together what you need to file for child support", "NTA and also lmao he is not a very wise man", "Bwaaahahaha really?? You BROKE UP!! Why does he assume that you wouldn\u2019t close any account you had jointly.

You might not comprehend that breaking up means you can't do that anymore. You owe me $XX for paying off your last crap.\"", "NTA.

I would ask him how in the world he could be so entitled to think an ex partner would continue to fund his hobbies after the relationship ended!", "NTA. You don't owe him a thing.\n\nThe question is how much does he owe you?", "NTA\n\nHe's an ex for a reason. Why should you keep funding his lifestyle? Just be lucky he didn't marry you..", "NTA\n\nHowever a word of advice: Drunks and kids usually tell the truth. He's given you warning of his plan so protect yourself.", "NTA. Your name your account you owe him nothing. Especially if he\u2019s threatening to take shit from you. He\u2019s lucky you weren\u2019t actually petty and took the kid from him too.", "Informing him would have been the nice thing to do. I suspect he no longer deserves nice treatment. You were under no obligation to inform him. You were under no obligation to give him access to your credit. He is causing problems because he can.", "Come on, is this even a real question?", "NTA baby man can pay for his own stuff", "I think he's an idi\\*t for even thinking that you *wouldn't* close it.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nEven if you had ended on good terms, it\u2019s ridiculous to think an ex would keep a line of credit open for you.\n\nHim being mad about it and saying it\u2019s petty is just him being an asshole and trying to manipulate you.", "**You are NTA** but do you need to speak to a lawyer preemptively since he was your child's sperm donor.", "NTA that dudes an idiot!", "NTA. He\u2019s delusional if he thinks you were going to keep paying for his hobbies after you broke up. Why the hell should you do that?", "NTA - you don\u2019t owe him anything.", "No, are you serious??? NTA", "It\u2019s technically fraud for him to use your credit card/LOC if he is not on it as well.", "ESH\n\nThis perspective explains a lot- You've dealt with him this long, had his child, and only now realizing he's a grub and ruining your life?", "NTA. The minute you broke up with him was the minute he could no longer expect to use that account", "\"Oops!  I closed the account.  Have a nice day!\"", "NTA", "NTA by a long shot.", "This. Freeze all your cards. Replace each one by one.", "Probably just a bully.

Everyone else only exists to meet his needs.", "I had an ex do that to me. Kicked me to the curb.

If you do that be prepared for a whole lot of \"you're ruining my life\" bullshit. Ignore him. But if you feel you might have a future fight on your hands, for money or custody get a lawyer.
