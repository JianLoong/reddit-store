Some people on here speculating you did it on purpose, but we have no way to actually know that and I don\u2019t see a reason to assume the worst about your intentions. \n\nBut it doesn\u2019t matter. You did take attention away from the bride, and it was totally predictable that you would. Lest there be any doubt, you didn\u2019t take the ring off after the FIRST person/group noticed. That was the time where it could all be chalked up to \u201coops, I didn\u2019t really think people would notice this.\u201d But you didn\u2019t, you left it on and the situation, predictably, repeated itself several times. \n\nEven assuming none of this was \u201cintentional\u201d it was the obvious outcome of your decision, and easily avoidable, so YTA.", "Yeesh this is a close one but the faux par swings it \n\nwhilst I get it was the first time you got to see people and in that respect it couldn't be helped you must have known on the lead up that announcements like this at someone else's wedding *especially without letting them know prior* is usually seen as a faux par and could have easily been avoided by either telling them prior or waiting until after to make it known \n\nSo while I'd be inclined to suggest you aren't the asshole the faux par just unfortunately just nudges it into YTA", "OP, ignore the other comments. NTA, because to assume that you're lying for no reason is stupid, and from ALL THAT WE KNOW FROM YOUR POST is that you MADE A MISTAKE. Everyone makes mistakes, these children are just assholes OP.", "YTA - this isnt quite on the level of getting engaged at the wedding, but you\u2019re still an AH for this. \n\nIf the news wasnt public, you should have waited and not worn the ring at all.", "Gonna go with NAH, because the bride has a right to be upset, and based on what you've written I believe that it was an honest mistake and you took the ring off as soon as you noticed. \n\nIf anything the friends that reacted like that are the AHs. Private congratulations probably wouldn't have been as big a problem, but inviting a whole group of people to heap attention on you instead of the bride is poor form.", "NTA, nauseate me how brides have 35k weddings just cos they\u2019re so desperate to be in fake limelight for half a day", "You decided to hold off on officially announcing your engagement to the people you didn't seem worthy of knowing immediately yet you made sure your engagement ring was visible enough whenever you chatted with someone not in your \"inner circle\" at a friend's wedding so you could talk about your engagement. Where's the \"accidental\" part of you revealing your engagement at someone event?  YTA", "This is petty bullshit. \n\nIt doesn't sound like you plotted for months and brought a blowhorn to interrupt the affair because you're an attention-whoring ring-flaunter out to steal the attention of a bride at her wedding.  But if you did - kudos - that would also be petty bullshit no one should care about.\n\nUnless your fiance proposed at the wedding, or you tapped a glass and asked for everyone's attention, you didn't announce your engagement. You wore your ring. You don't have to take off your engagement ring to attend a wedding. Telling the bride in advance sounds like it would have been a good idea, but hindsight is 20/20. \n\nThis idea that brides can and should be supported as entitled biznitches for a day is ridiculous. \n\nNTA", "YTA if you were saving the announcement for later you should not have worn the ring to the wedding.

You never do anything at a wedding that would take attention away from the couple and you should have thought of this. Your \u2018I forgot\u2019 excuse is not good enough I\u2019m not surprised bride is pissed.", "YTA and a liar. I don\u2019t believe you forgot about your ring only a week after getting it. You did this on purpose.", "YTA\n\nYou pulled focus from the bride and groom.\n\nDid you also wear white?", "NTA I don\u2019t believe you did it on purpose. You didn\u2019t make a big announcement at her wedding, people just noticed your ring and acted accordingly. I can understand the bride being upset but in my opinion, the planet doesn\u2019t stop spinning when it\u2019s someone\u2019s wedding. You took it of when you realized it\u2019s becoming a thing at her wedding. You have the right to wear your ring, to be happy about your milestone as well. Learn from this and when it\u2019s your time to be a bride, understand that things might just happen that are out of anyone\u2019s control.", "YTA, I will take ur word for it and believe it was an honest mistake, still the A.", "By the fact that you took it off and put it in your purse, I'd say it was definitely not intentional, but it's still a pretty shitty thing to happen to the bride who was supposed to be the center of attention, I understand her being upset.\nThat being said, it's not like you can take it back. Best you can do is apologize and explain what you explained to us and move on. You're not some evil person. You're just a person who didn't think about this scenario and unintentionally ended up being the ahole.", ">At this point I felt pretty bad that the attention wasn't on the bride\n\nI don't think so.\n\n>once that group cleared I took the ring off and placed it in my clutch for the rest of the night.\n\nNot the first time someone commented on it, just when you'd got enough attention. If you didn't want people to know, you wouldn't have worn it. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou thought that you'd wait until after the wedding because you didn't want to steal the limelight BUT you forgot the ring.  It may not be an intentional act and you forgot, but that's what makes you the AH.", " YTA \n\nSorry but the 'i forgot' excuse doesn't really fly. You should have been more considerate in remembering to take your ring off. I'm not surprised the bride is annoyed because you did basically announce your engagement at her wedding.", "YTA. You forgot? Are you that oblivious? I doubt it. You did something extremely selfish.", "Nta", "YTA.  Why tell anyone before the wedding?  You should have expected that word would get around and wearing the ring sure didn\u2019t help.", "NTA to choose announcing your engagement until after the wedding. YTA for wearing the engagement ring during the wedding/reception.", "YTA and you know you did it on purpose. Then you doubled down and made it more about yourself by taking the ring off after everyone talked about it. Very envious behavior.", "Soft YTA. Look, there are some pretty rude and demeaning comments which isn't great, but you made a mistake and that mistake impacted the wedding day of someone else who has every right to be upset. Weddings take a lot of work and money, as you're about to find out, and you only get one shot at it (typically). And that day is forever tainted for the bride by your mistake. \n\nI think you owe the bride an apology if possible, and some flowers.", "Sorry OP but yeah you are a bit of an ah for this, even if you feel it was unintentional.\n\nThe sad thing is that your friend (the bride) will always have that feeling of hurt every time she looks back on her wedding.\n\nIf you truly had forgotten about wearing the ring (which tbh I\u2019m doubtful of seeing as a week isn\u2019t really long enough to get used to the \u2018feel\u2019 of wearing a new ring) and you didn\u2019t want to distract from the bride\u2019s limelight, then you surely would have taken it off the first time someone mentioned it. \nThis sounds like you actually enjoyed the attention and didn\u2019t really think through the consequences to your friend.", "YTA. Do people stare at your hands all the time when you chat to them during a wedding? I doubt it. I rarely look at people's hands when chatting.\n\nYou made sure they saw the ring and I don't buy the story that you forgot to take it off. If you really had forgotten it and didn't want to flaunt it, you would have taken it off as soon as the the first person mentioned.", "YTA. You displayed an astounding lack of basic wedding etiquette. You also seem to have displayed lots of 'main character energy'.\n\nYikes.", "So I am going to say NAH and here is why: yes, it is the bride and grooms \"moment\" as it was their wedding...but you didn't stand up at their ceremony and shout it (or hell wear white for that matter). People noticed and asked to which you responded. You were trying to keep it on the down low until after the wedding, which was nice of you. She needs to calm down and just enjoy the celebration. The amount of stress she put on that little thing, my goodness she'll give herself a stroke if someone else winds up coming to her baby shower pregnant. \n\nAlso, your life and exciting life moments don't stop just because she got married. I would've worn my ring with pride. You are engaged! It's exciting and nothing that should be hidden. She was too at one point and probably was during other people's weddings. So wear your ring and be excited as well. She'll either get over it or find new friends. \n\nPs. Disagree with me is fine, but to those who think no one notices your hands and you were \"flaunting your ring\"...BS. People (especially girls!) notice those things. Especially engagement rings. They want to compare either what they have or what they want to what you have (girls are judgy and also excited for other engagements). It is why we wear rings, so people know we are in a committed relationship by a simple glance. We eloped and to save money we just did wedding bands. I was happy with that. When my husband surprised me a few years later (after we paid debts off and bought a house) with the matching \"engagement\" ring I was excited, but since we were already married, I didn't say anything or flaunt it at all. I just went about life like normal. My co worker noticed it at lunch the first day back to work after the holidays. She was like \"holy cannoli batman WTF? Why didn't you tell us?\" Other friends noticed and said things. His aunt said something at Christmas the following year.", "Girl ahahahahahahahhaahahahahahaahha\n\nYou wanted to keep the engagement a secret, but you wore the engagement ring at a wedding with a good chunk of your social circle? Ahahahaahahahahahahagagaha\n\nI don't know if you're the AH, but for sure, this isn't the best showcase of your intelligence\n\nYTA,I guess", "YTA. And this sentence gives it away:\n\n\"So, whenever I went up to chat to them, they would notice the ring and congratulate me and my fiance on our engagement. \"\n\nIf this wasn't intentional, you would have taken the ring off the very first time someone mentioned the ring. But it happened over and over. You intentionally kept wearing the ring after at least several people commented on it.\n\nYTA for intentionally announcing your engagement via a very noticeable ring that you intentionally did not remove until everyone already knew.", "Was your engagement also the main topic of the wedding for the rest of the night? I mean weddings are usually pretty long, how long was the circle of friends around you? People can congratulate you and still enjoy the wedding NTA", "You win-perfect take. Announcing literally ANYTHING at a wedding is an AH move.\n\nYTA OP", "So... you don't believe humans can make mistakes anymore? Really? That's your take? What are you, 14?", "Also, the \u201coh I forgot\u201d excuse became void as soon as the first person noticed and asked about her ring. There was quite a bit of this, before the scene built up.", "They do if you wave your hands around, keep messing with your hair and that kind of thing. 'Oh THIS? Yeah, we're ENGAGED...but don't say anything, I'm not flaunting it, just waving things around in case you didn't notice it already'.", "I don't believe so. People who I spoke to would congratulate me when they spoke to me throughout the night, but apart from that first group I don't believe it was anything noticeable looking from the outside. \n\nThat group did last several minutes though but they made a lot of noise and attention towards me.", "Wow you think that\u2019s a bad take it\u2019s obvious from the post what OP meant to do. Don\u2019t be rude because u disagree with the majority."]}
