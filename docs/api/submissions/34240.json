Look, there are some pretty rude and demeaning comments which isn't great, but you made a mistake and that mistake impacted the wedding day of someone else who has every right to be upset.

Do people stare at your hands all the time when you chat to them during a wedding? I doubt it. I rarely look at people's hands when chatting.\n\nYou made sure they saw the ring and I don't buy the story that you forgot to take it off.

You displayed an astounding lack of basic wedding etiquette. You also seem to have displayed lots of 'main character energy'.\n\nYikes.", "So I am going to say NAH and here is why: yes, it is the bride and grooms \"moment\" as it was their wedding...but you didn't stand up at their ceremony and shout it (or hell wear white for that matter). People noticed and asked to which you responded. You were trying to keep it on the down low until after the wedding, which was nice of you. She needs to calm down and just enjoy the celebration. The amount of stress she put on that little thing, my goodness she'll give herself a stroke if someone else winds up coming to her baby shower pregnant. \n\nAlso, your life and exciting life moments don't stop just because she got married. I would've worn my ring with pride. You are engaged! It's exciting and nothing that should be hidden. She was too at one point and probably was during other people's weddings. So wear your ring and be excited as well. She'll either get over it or find new friends. \n\nPs. Disagree with me is fine, but to those who think no one notices your hands and you were \"flaunting your ring\"...BS. People (especially girls!) notice those things. Especially engagement rings. They want to compare either what they have or what they want to what you have (girls are judgy and also excited for other engagements). It is why we wear rings, so people know we are in a committed relationship by a simple glance. We eloped and to save money we just did wedding bands. I was happy with that. When my husband surprised me a few years later (after we paid debts off and bought a house) with the matching \"engagement\" ring I was excited, but since we were already married, I didn't say anything or flaunt it at all. I just went about life like normal. My co worker noticed it at lunch the first day back to work after the holidays. She was like \"holy cannoli batman WTF? Why didn't you tell us?\" Other friends noticed and said things. His aunt said something at Christmas the following year.", "[removed]", "YTA.

Cousin Betty is sporting a Baby Bump at Aunt Marla's wedding that we didn't notice at Cousin Melly's Engagement Party three months ago. Maggie is wearing an engagement ring, so People pause to congratulate her and her Uncle John on the way to the dance floor. Cousin Marla and her groom could care less.

NTA. The bride and groom should not expect all their guests to pretend to put their lives on hold for the sake of it being \"their big day\". The day is already about them, everyone came to celebrate them and wish them well in their marriage. That was the whole point of coming together.", "I\u2019m going against the grain here and saying NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to remove your engagement ring. I don\u2019t know why brides get so twisted about this. It\u2019s not like he proposed at their wedding. Even if you told everyone before the wedding, they would have wanted to congratulate you in person. If my friend gets engaged, I\u2019m happy for them and I\u2019m happy that others feel the same way.", "NTA and I honestly don't get those saying otherwise.  Two reasons: \n\nFirst, weddings are de facto reunions a lot of the time.  They bring together people that don't see each other that often, and who maybe have drifted apart a bit.  People can't help spending some time catching up with one another - and they should.\n\nSecond, this idea that everyone's attention needs to be 100% on the newly weds 100% of the time is ridiculous.  Everybody is there for the wedding.  You have to have a pretty low self esteem if you think hearing about a childhood friend's engagement or a cousin's college acceptance or an aunt's gall bladder surgery is going to cause people to forget why there's a party going on.\n\nAt the heart of it, this is a case where someone is upset because they think it's a zero sum game when it's not.

No, you didn\u2019t. You literally did everything you could to make sure people would talk about your engagement. You could have not worn your ring in the first place.

I'm so sick of the \"all the attention needs to be on me 100% of the time OMG OMG I'm SOOOOO FUCKING IMPORTANT!!!!\" attitude at weddings.  No one is ever that important.  There are always more than one thing going on.  So for 5 minutes guests noticed OP got engaged, who gives a shit.  If that is enough to ruin your wedding, then I pity your attempt at marriage.  Everyone needs to grow up and be a little bit less self centered at weddings.  I like the idea that they are about families coming together instead of it revolving all around the bride honestly (which you can disagree with, that's fine, we can all have our own weddings).  Obviously the bride and groom should get the final say in decisions, but I never liked the idea that it's all about them to the point of absurdity.  I'm not saying it's not about them, just that you are allowed to get pregnant, engaged, go to the fucking moon or do whatever the fuck else you want around a wedding.  Just don't wear white.", "Maybe I'm weird, but honestly, who gives a fuck? I, as a bride, wouldn't expect someone to hide their engagement ring at my wedding??

Come on, now. Don't be silly. You knew what you were doing. \n\nIf it really bothered you, you would have removed the ring the very FIRST time someone mentioned it, and perhaps asked them to keep quiet about it so you didn't risk stealing the limelight. But it was the perfect opportunity to show off in front of all your friends and you couldn't resist.", "YTA. So it didn\u2019t occur to you to remove the ring after maybe 1-2 comments?

And I'm sorry, but the excuse of: \"I understand I probably should have never worn the ring there in the first place, but I had had it on for a week so it didn't ever cross my mind to take it off until it was too late\".

All these people telling you that you are, sheesh!  Are you not allowed to talk to people? Do you have to hide what is happening in your life? It\u2019s not like you walked in and made this huge announcement. Conversations happen organically. IMO, the bride over reacted. You didn\u2019t intentionally steal the lime light. Why do you have to hide your ring?  Are you not allowed to just be you? If I found out someone was engaged at my wedding I would be happy for them. I would even gush over her ring. I would know that people are here at my wedding to see me and be happy for me. I would also know that people have conversations that have nothing to do with me, as it should be.  OP, you did nothing wrong.", "ESH. You and the bride care way to much about the attention of others.", "Why did you keep it secret and not post online?  If you had posted online when it happened then this shituation wouldn't have arisen.

It's one or the other. Announce it well before or after the wedding or keep the ring out of sight until well after. Appearing to attention seek at someone else's event is a look well worth avoiding.", "YTA. There's a quote I'll probably get wrong, that says don't attribute to malice what can be better explained by ignorance, but at some point ignorance is so great that it's indistinguishable from malice. Meaning, even if this was an honest mistake, it's such a stupid and avoidable mistake that it doesn't really matter if it was an accident. You should've left the ring at home.", "YTA, that was deliberate and you know that.

It's not like you kept it a secret for months just to show off the ring at someone else's wedding. You also shouldn't have to hide your life to make someone else happy. Your happiness doesn't take away from someone else's.\n\nOther people can learn to mind their own damn business. Maybe they should learn not to make a big deal out of someone else's engagement at a wedding. And the bride should accept that the world doesn't revolve around her, not even on her wedding day. It would have been a sweet moment for you both to congratulate each other and bond over weddings/wedding planning. But maybe that's just me, because I've never seen the big deal about weddings. \n\nIf you were purposefully seeking attention, you would be the AH because that's just an AH move, but honestly I think the bride is being too sensitive.

I get wanting to make a commitment of love in front of family and friends, so whatever. Good for them. But expecting to be a special princess for the entire day and having 100% attention on you seems a little insecure and unreasonable. \n\nAt weddings, people are often catching up with people they haven\u2019t seen in months or even years.

It\u2019s actually just the wedding ceremony and then a party after. Most weddings are something of a family reunion anyway. People who haven\u2019t seen each other in some time get together and chat and catch up.

Either you keep something a secret or you don't. Having a secret which you share with a million people is not a secret.", "Yta you either announce it before hand or don't wear rhe ring at someone else's wedding its very simple", "YTA. You basically stole the light from the wedding and it took you waaay too long to notice the problem when it was so obvious.", "YTA as already said , you wanted to keep it secret, but you wore the ring. seriously? The first time someone said ANYTHING you should have p\\[almed the ring at once but you didn't you kept it on and the chatter going.\n\nIt may not have been done on purpose but yeah, it was a bad move and it did draw the attention from the bride on her day. so YTA if only for being thoughtless even if not actively malicious.", "YTA because your friend is right. You flaunted your engagement and you could\u2019ve easily taken the ring off for ONE DAY for her to enjoy her wedding but you went and made it about yourself.

I hope the bride annouxe her pregnancy on your wedding day.. hahahahah", "YTA you know what you did.", "YTA and it seems more like this was a plan as opposed to a coincidence.

You wore the ring long enough for word to get around before you took it off but by then it was a topic of conversation which is probably what you were going for anyway.", "I guess I'm in the minority here, but NTA. This whole taking attention away from the bride mentality is so dumb. Everybody is at their wedding - they know who the bride is. You're allowed to wear your engagement ring. If people are happy for you because you just got engaged, so be it. I don't think you need to hide it because someone else in the room might feel like they're not receiving 100% of the attention. It's ridiculous.", "Sorry but YTA like you trying to keep it as a secret but wear the ring it doesn't sound like really trying lol, that day was to celebrate the union of your friend and her husband, not your engagement with your now fiance, if you see that people start to notice your ring you just take it off and pretend it didn't happen.", "YTA. My fiance and I got engaged 3 days before our friend's wedding (according to fiance that wasn't the plan but he ended up blurting it out) and that ring and didn't go anywhere near my finger until until weeks after the wedding, along with any public announcement, because we knew our friends deserved every ounce of attention whilst in their wedding bubble.

I feel secondhand embarrassment for you. Your title is purposely misleading. No one is an AH for not announcing an engagement. You're an AH for using someone's event to do it and then playing dumb about it. \n\nI dont understand 'forgetting' to take off the ring. You got a significant piece of jewelry a week prior and you already are so comfortable and not excited about it that you completely forgot you were wearing it? And when other people reminded you several times about it? \n\nYou would do well to examine this behavior, OP, and why you crave attention to the point that you are willing to hurt people's feelings and sour your friendships. The bride clearly saw this for what it was and so did almost everyone on this thread, despite the fact that you control the narrative here. This is your version of events and you look bad.

The new $100 bills REALLY DO have microfine printing on them!\" I put my snack back and waited for him outside. I tore into him for flaunting. He defended his action by saying it wasn't intentional, he was just commenting on the artistry and anti-counterfeiting measures of the new Benjis.

If anybody is in the wrong its all the people congratulating her. And even that's a stretch.", "ESH. A lot people won't agree but I feel like the bride might have taken this a little too far. How would she know that you were scouting for attention? You mentioned you took it off after the group, but that's a sign your conscience kicked in. It might have gotten worse if you kept that ring on. Good on you, but you should have thought of that ahead of time.\n\nEdit: Now that I read the comments, a lot of them are not taking in the fact that people can still have a life at a wedding. Things like surgeries and engagements and a new gf/bf are 99.9% sure to happen, especially if it's distant family or people you don't see often. The bride can't expect everyone's life to be put on hold in order to celebrate HER AND ONLY HER. How self-centered of her! You should have kept that ring on. Who cares if she calls you a liar? That makes her a fake friend if she isn't the slightest bit happy for you, everyone deserves a congrats, but the bride just gets a little extra. PERIOD. NOT. THE. A-HOLE.", "Nta.

Also I will say, when my partner and I got engaged, we were getting congratulations for months in different friend groups, at people\u2019s birthdays, family gatherings, book launches etc. these were all events where we weren\u2019t meant to be the central people, and we weren\u2019t, we just had some little joyful moments with others interspersed amongst all of the other lovely conversations you have with people in your life.", "What absolute fucking bullshit is this?\n\nWeddings are supposed to be a celebration of love and commitment, not limelights focused on narcissistic brides.\n\nNTA, but she is.

If you\u2019re not clinking a glass and making a big attention-seeking speech about yourself or pulling a stunt or something, everyone should just calm down.

And it does LOOK like you waited to tell people about your engagement until you were at a wedding or something. Terrible optics.\n\nDid you think about this at all beforehand? Your description reads like you did not. Then this is an accident, but you still caused it. So, you were not thoughtful of this, which happens but also assholey.

People are often very reluctant to take off the symbol of their love and upcoming marriage, taking it off at all feels like a huge concession and something she was not obliged to do.\n\nThings OP should have done - announce before the wedding, particularly to the bride. The need for perfect photos (\"for the gram\") got in the way here. I'm surprised the ring gained that much attention - unless the diamond is the size of a grape most people don't notice what rings people are wearing. It wasn't unreasonable to expect any recognition of her engagement to be low-key and not many people to notice or be interested. It was wrong - but not unreasonable.\n\nSo I'm going NTA.

I think using a wedding is particularly egregious because of how much money and effort the couple tend to put in to organise, and the someone swoops in putting in none of the effort and gets the benefit of the big audience/nice setting etc. But really it's not cool anywhere, don't announce a pregnancy at a graduation, don't announce that you're emigrating at someone's baby shower etc.", "Not necessarily.  Some nosy people scan left ringfingers like hawks.  All the more reason that OP should not have worn the ring regardless of size.

Please don\u2019t let other people decide for you what your intent was.\n\nThe rabid way people approach weddings is insane to me.\n\nNews flash: weddings are great and fun, but they do not make you the center of the world.

Putting on a bunch of jewelry for a wedding and not thinking about your engagement ring you have been wearing around family and close friends already seems like something I could easily do by accident. I\u2019m also a bit of a space cadet which should be evident by me forgetting to put on my own wedding ring all the time, but I think it\u2019s very possible that OP just spaced out and didn\u2019t think of this while getting ready\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean they are winning any friend of the year awards for being extremely thoughtful of their friend and how they showed up to the wedding for the friend but it also doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are an asshole in my opinion.", "NTA -she got engaged, it was a life event that just happened.

I am from the US, but live abroad and where I live now weddings are very much a family and friends day and celebration and just a lot more laid back. \n\nI think as a curtesy I would have told the bride before the wedding, but still NTA.", "I am sick to death of people\u2019s attitudes about weddings. A wedding is a (grossly expensive and totally overdone) celebration of the beginning of a marriage. It is not an excuse for the world to revolve around you, you aren\u2019t doing anything heroic. The focus should also not be on the bride solely, she is not the only one in the relationship. No where in the history of the world has anyone forgotten why they were attending a wedding, unless they have memory issues. People are getting married, being born and dying on \u201cyour special day\u201d, are they also stealing your thunder? Please get over yourselves. If someone gets engaged and it is announced, noticed or commented on during \u201cyour special day\u201d it does not take away from your celebration or more importantly your marriage. I guarantee people still know what they are there for. Love should always be celebrated, there is far too much pain in the world. If people put as much focus and effort on their marriages and relationships as they do on weddings the world would be a better place. A person who just got engaged should not feel the need to hide it because someone else is getting married, ridiculous. And shame on the people shaming her, find a new hobby.", "Agreed. Maybe she was eager to show that she wasn\u2019t going to be knocked up and unmarried.", "This is just, such a non problem is rooted in so much narcissism. The real asshole is a culture that cares more about the wedding and the Bride lording it over people than actually fostering healthy partnerships.", "Exactly! I went to a friend from law school\u2019s wedding after I got engaged (we had announced on ig already) and several people congratulated us. It was literally \u201ccongratulations!\u201d \u201cThank you! How\u2019s the chicken?\u201d", "this is insane bc OP wasn't the only person with autonomy at the wedding, those people could have been CHILL and not made a big deal about her at someone else's wedding. weddings aren't just about the bride. they're about the groom. they're a *gathering.* are people supposed to just only talk about the bride the entire time??????", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll so long to see a normal response lol\nNTA people are wild! You should not have to take off an engagement ring at someone else\u2019s wedding unless YOU want it kept a secret. It sounds like you just didn\u2019t post it in IG. How do you think people found info like this out before social media?? Also weddings are SO long and there are so many people to talk to, it\u2019s crazy to me that the bride would even care, I barely had time to eat two bites of food and say hi to my guests at my wedding lol, someone literally threw up all over the floor right outside the bathrooms and I didn\u2019t know until the next day", "This is the ringer.  She didn\u2019t take it off after the first time it happened.  The \u201cI forgot\u201d excuse doesn\u2019t work when everybody\u2019s been pointing it out.  She intentionally did this because she wanted attention and then tried to save face.", "They told close friends and family and are waiting for their engagement photos to come back before posting on social media. \nIt's not a grand conspiracy to steal the Bride's thunder. \n\nMy God. I've never been to a wedding where 100% of conversations are about the bride and groom. People socialize and catch up. Social media has made people focus way too much on themselves. \nSo what if it's the bride's \"big day\"?\n\nThat doesn't mean all the people attending become NPCs. They still have their own lives and they will still catch up with each other.", "Man I would get crucified by everyone here. I don't do much social media, especially anything with extended family on it. So if I got engaged I would do what OP did, tell close friends and family. If I went to a wedding yeah there'd be people who wouldn't know. I just don't get all this nonsense of hide good things for you and how dare guests not spend 100% of their time on the bride and groom", "Yeah you could do that. But it just seems like such a non-issue. If OP wants to actually take the ring off, then she can and she did when it got to be too much.\n\nBut not doing so in no way makes OP an asshole. The assholes are the people who think other people should stop existing to satisfy the insanity that is believing other people don\u2019t matter because you\u2019re getting married.", "Why should she have taken her ring off? It\u2019s her ring.", "Thank you, for a moment I thought I was going crackers.\n\nPeople's lives don't stop because you're getting married. They'll get engaged, pregnant, hell, even married! Why should they be hiding their life events? As long as OP didn't grab the mic and announce her engagement to all and sundry during the speeches, I don't see how she's the asshole. \n\nSo people noticed the ring and congratulated her, failing to talk about the bride's radiance for like 30 seconds. Big deal.", "Sure there is, it's all about the bride. I think everyone should take off engagement rings, wedding rings. How dare anyone not be single attending a wedding", "Yep. Completely bonkers. Weddings are an occasion where people naturally catch up with each other. I don't think I've ever been to a wedding where I haven't met up with someone I haven't seen for a while. There's nothing wrong with telling people in conversation that you're engaged, showing them your ring and so on.", "Nobody is jumping to anything, OP spelled it out for us.  She went up to several people who noticed the ring and didn\u2019t take it off.  She only took it off after a crowd had gathered, fawned over her, then dispersed.  She was clearly wanting attention.", "Apparently everyone else ceases to be human if someone they know is getting married. The culture is so fucked that people genuinely are acting like Op did anything even remotely wrong. \n\nIt\u2019s like\u2026 this is such a waste of energy and it really shows how toxic people can be about weddings, and relationships in general.\n\nI hope our culture can move away from the narcissism to fostering loving healthy connections.\n\nReading Reddit is so depressing because it does absolutely reveal a lot. The fact it\u2019s called a \u201cfaux pas\u201d says more about other people than it does about OP.", ">I\u2019m shocked how many people think OP is an AH.\n\nIt's not too hard to understand, although I wouldn't care.\n\nFirst, it's generally a taboo to announce big news at someone else's wedding.  And even though this wasn't an \"announcement\", not telling pretty much anyone there and making it obvious (I don't think op was flaunting, but it's probably going to be obvious) is pretty much the same thing.\n\nSecond, if there's any doubt, you should run it by the bride.  \"Hey, I'm engaged, would you mind if I wore my ring?\" Is an easy thing to do to show respect.  Since you're breaking a taboo, it's generally good to just ask first.", "She got engaged 1 week ago and everyone she has seen since then knows (cause she\u2019s been wearing the ring for the last week). That\u2019s not a secret. That\u2019s just not making an \u201cannouncement\u201d on social media.", "More likely the photos haven't come back yet. Professional photos will take a few weeks to get back to you.", "If it\u2019s a faux pas that says more about the culture than anything else. And it\u2019s a toxic culture. Genuinely, who cares that much? And why? You\u2019re getting married. Go live your life instead of being upset other people are also just\u2026 living life.", "I got married four months ago and I couldn't imagine having ten minutes to be worried about what my guests were discussing when I wasn't there. Unless there was anyone being particularly rude to the bride's face about it, but then that would be on them and not the OP for wearing her engagement ring.", "This sounds like a generational thing. I'm 60 (yeah, a boomer). I learned about this crazy thing called etiquette when I was younger. I know that apparently no one under 50 seems to know what it is anymore. But hey, at least I'm at the age where I can say \"these damned kids today!\" \ud83d\ude06   OP - YTA.", "Are you fucking kidding me??? Asking the bride if you can wear your engagement ring?!?!", "I completely agree. It seems crazy to me that the bride and the commenters are assuming that OP kept her engagement a secret just to show up the bride.", "I am also Gen-X and I see so many posts on here about lifelong friendships being gutted by this stuff. It just amazes me that people can be this selfish that they cannot just be happy for their friend. No one is making the entire wedding about her getting engaged. Everyone still remembers they are there for your wedding. And it is always the brides who are upset. The grooms do not even get mentioned. \"You ruined MY wedding.\" What kind of man is marrying these women? Buddy, you are in for some years of absolute hell.", "Because the current generations getting married are mostly crazy and not well mannered.\n\nI say this as a member of one of these generations \ud83d\ude05", "Hey! Maybe the Bride\u2019s strength is powered by people talking about her, and if they stop, it breaks the power multiplier.\n\nOutside of jokes, yeah. Honestly, when you put it in simplest terms, what the bride and the YTA commenters are asking for is only conversation about the bride and groom only, and that\u2019s just\u2026 wild.", "\u2026.because it should be mocked. Having a wedding doesn\u2019t give you a free pass to turn into a self absorbed asshole.", "it's not weird at all, but like i mentioned to the other person who was aghast that people wore rings on whatever finger they felt like, it may be a regional or social circle thing. \n\nalso, not every culture uses engagement and wedding rings.", "I would not call my reaction \"aghast\".", "There is definitely a focus on bride making it about her and not a couple\u2014 two people\u2014getting together in love in a lot of these wedding posts for sure.\n\nThe groom, in all honesty, probably didn\u2019t give a shit, and why should he? If he\u2019s found someone he loves and wants to marry, I just can\u2019t see how someone else getting engaged should even matter.\n\nI personally want to get married some day, but the culture surrounding romance and weddings has led to a lot of really toxic and problematic things in my head, and I know that I\u2019m in the same landmass sized boat as everyone else alive today. When I do work through my unhealthy emotional/intimacy issues and find a partner who I would want to marry, there\u2019s absolutely nothing that could ruin the day or distract from the complete joy of starting a family with a partner who I love and it will be a wonderful event where our absolutely unhinged families and friends will just be free to be themselves and be happy and it won\u2019t bother me any, because I already know how they are and it\u2019s silly to expect people to just stop being in whatever way they are just to conform to my expectations. And besides, the focus for the wedding couple, at the end of the day, is each other. I would hope my hypothetical groom wouldn\u2019t be so distracted by what a different couple is doing. And I would hope I wouldn\u2019t be so disrespectful to what we have together to waste what should be a positive day on something so mundane and also inherently negative. I\u2019ve spent enough time wasting beautiful moments on unreal problems and it just feels like the wrong foot to start of a new life together with.\n\nI think when you make the event in the beginning the most important, it leads to people who get married for the wrong reasons.\n\nYounger women end up getting married way sooner than they should because the goal becomes the wedding\u2014 the most important day of their life\u2014 than who they are sharing that wedding with.\n\nI try to be compassionate and remember that people used to, and in some places, still do, get married out of obligation or societal pressure and that is genuinely the messaging we have blasted into our brains from before we can even create a coherent thought.\n\nBut the commenters in this thread are absolutely on one."]}
