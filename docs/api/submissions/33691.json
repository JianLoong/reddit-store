Sounds like you have an AH mother.", "NTA because she never owned up to it, never accepted responsibility and never showed concern for the very real long-lasting damage she caused to your health. (And apparently was never held accountable by your family either). Forgiveness is for grieved person to give when they feel it and no one else gets a say. Your mother and siblings feel strongly about you mending fences with her but were they concerned about her mending fences with you, since you were on the receiving end of the damage? It could have been an accident and therapy would probably be of great benefit to you because the pain you are caring around is not healthy either, but you are not responsible for making your sister feel better or being the peacemaker for your family. Good luck OP.", "NTA.\n\nWhy didn't your parents get your eye repaired? Sounds like you have an AH mother.", "INFO ??? How old was she when she \u201cdamaged\u201d your eye ? There is not a sibling on this earth who has never injured their sibling, hurt them or anything like that before. You need to grow up. Accidents happen. To tell her son you hate his mother is extremely childish.", "Way too much info missing. 20s, 30s, little kid...??? With the little info provided, you're the AH.", "YTA because you're getting other people involved. If you don't like her, stay away from her. But telling her son that you hate her? Way out of line. Just avoid her if you truly cannot forgive her.", "NTA for holding a grudge but YTA for telling her son you hate her. No need to involve her kid when it\u2019s not his beef", "YTA \nLook, I get that you\u2019re permanently injured and that\u2019s awful. But you\u2019re refusing to forgive her for a childhood ACCIDENT? You don\u2019t *have* to forgive her, but it feels like you\u2019re trying to make yourself the victim here instead of trying to move on and be happy. \n\nObviously my vote can change with more info- this is very different if she was 18 or 13, for example.", "Yta. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean to hit your eye\u2026 and having been the teen forced to watch the kid sibling, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t her first choice to be there either. It sucks that you\u2019ve got damage, but holding a grudge for presumably 15 years or more? The only one you\u2019re hurting here is yourself. She\u2019s not being pestered by the family, or pushed out, you\u2019re only forcing yourself out by refusing to forgive her. I\u2019m not saying it will be easy, but maybe try talking to a therapist about why you\u2019re so angry. Yes, she wronged you, but was it intentional? Probably not, and again, holding something like that against someone who probably can\u2019t admit fault due to feeling guilty in the first place, it\u2019s not beneficial to any parties involved for you to hate her.", "Yta. \n\nI doubt she meant to hit your eye, you admittedly were winding her up. \n\nSounds like she won't admit to it because she doesn't wants to acknowledge she hurt you you because she didn't mean to and she probably already feels really bad and your telling people you hate her years later.... \n\nYour parents should have had the injury sorted after it was done.", "Yes, you're the AH big time! Holy crap lady! My little brother spear chucked a broom at me, shattering my eye socket. We were kids. About 10 years later, an inoperable aneurysm was discovered in my brain. We're now in our 50's and I've never told him he was the cause. I can drop dead, literally at any time. He wasn't trying to permanently damage me we were fighting. Grow up and stop hurting your nephew!", "YTA for involving others. \n\nYou gotta get over your Irish Alzheimer\u2019s - only remembering your grudges. Talk to her and work it out.", "NAH I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.  What a terrible accident.  Should a teen who was responsible for your safety have harmed you? No.  That\u2019s a major breach of trust.  Do teens do impulsive things often with major consequences? Yes.  \nWhat was your relationship like before that? What is she like with other people? \nIs it possible to imagine forgiving her for your sake - but not having a relationship while that\u2019s activating for you? \nForgiveness isn\u2019t for the other person, and it doesn\u2019t even mean having a relationship but it does mean accepting what happened and putting it down.

Age seems really important here- not just you and your sibling when it happened, but also the age of the child. You telling a kid you hate their mom is really petty tbh. *Especially* if they're young. Your risking not only the relationship with your sister and the child, but also yours with the child.", "What\u2019s wrong with that? It seems like you just don\u2019t think she has a right to be mad. \n\nIf instead you thought she did have a right to be mad, then you\u2019d be fine with her telling son.", "Is this true no matter what she did? What if she tried to kill op, should she still play nice for her kid lol.", "She lied about it tho\u2026 I\u2019d literally do some deranged, true crime shit if someone humiliated me by taking my money and my sight, lied about it, then blamed me.

I feel like that\u2019s important", "She lied, it\u2019s not on her to work it out", "12 and 19 are both teens but incredibly different ages imo. Iv been pinching my sibling until about 16 lol. Its normal.", ">If instead you thought she did have a right to be mad, then you\u2019d be fine with her telling son.\r\n\nNo, I wouldn't. I don't condone involving someone's kids with your issues with the parents. Regardless of how valid that anger is. It's just inappropriate. Leave their kids out of the conflict you two have.\n\nI do think it's a bit odd to hold a grudge for what could be almost two decades, to the point where you hate your sibling, but that's on OP if she can't forgive her. \n\nWhat's absolutely crossing a line is airing that out to her sister's child who is likely a minor.", "i don\u2019t see the point in involving the kid? did the kid commit the act? no so why should he suffer the repercussions?", "Ah, maybe I didn\u2019t read it correctly- it sounds to me like she said she didn\u2019t remember just bc OP keeps bringing it up over and over again. Where does it say she took his money? And OP telling the son he hates her mom is just kinda mean and uncalled for tbh", "It was the 70s. Of course, we kept fighting. We were children. No, he never apologized, but he was never told to. Nor did he get in any trouble. I never blamed him for any of it bc we were fighting. He has never been told that the damage you can't see was caused by him. His goal wasn't to maim me, hurt me, and winning the fight was the goal. Spending needless amounts of time being bitter about something you can't change is silly. Telling your nephew you hate their mother is downright, creul.", "Why not? Why are we obligated to parent the kids of people who wronged us, by shielding them from the truth?", "Yeah but that\u2019s a completely incomparable situation to hers. Your brother didn\u2019t immediately react by gaslighting you so it\u2019s completely different."]}
