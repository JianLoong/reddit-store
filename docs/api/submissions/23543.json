Ask him to go back to his cave. Man\u2019s living in dinosaur era.", "ESH yea what he said had a strong sexist tone but ignoring him was not a healthy way to respond. Sucks that you need to explain to your boyfriend why what he said wasn\u2019t ok but if he\u2019s otherwise a decent human being I\u2019d give him at least a chance to learn.", "NTA. Maybe stop making meals for him for a while.", "NTA, but he just showed you who he is. You need to slow down and take a real careful look at this.

Personally, I can do the basics, but in our house it is my husband that can whizz up total cheffy masterpieces.", "NTA. That was not a complemaint. That was a sexist remark.", "I\u2019d dump him. But I\u2019m old and dumb by stand by that bullshit. \n\nIs he up on his manly knowledge? Can he rebuild a carburetor? Rewire the house? Fix the furnace? If he\u2019s expecting these gender roles, he\u2019s got some caching up to do if he\u2019s not out there hunting for your dinner. And what kind of man eats Mac\u2019n Cheese! He\u2019s going to lose his He-Man Woman Hater\u2019s Club card.", "NTA. my ex husband once told me that it was my responsibility to cook for him because I was his wife.

BF is a misogynist who still thinks rigid gender roles are still a thing. \n\nMy parents were born in 1918 and 1921. They had 3 boys & 2 girls. We were ALL taught to cook, along with all the \"traditional\" women's work. We were also ALL taught how to use a lawn mower, tools & all the \"traditional\" men's work. \n\nAny parent who doesn't make sure their children can take care of themselves & a house are doing them a disservice. And if they only teach them half of what they should because GeNdEr RoLeS, they have failed society by unleashing incompetent assholes who only know how to be half an adult.", "Nta. This is not a compliment. Ask him if he knows how to build a house, or skin a deer, or how to defend your home in case of attackers, because he should because he's a man.

If he doesn't get the message by then, I believe.", "NTA- it sounds like your bf needs cooking boot camp- aka he needs to cook dinner for a week.

I would be more upset over his claim that it was a compliment than over an ill-considered remark in the first place.", "Really you think you're wrong? Why on Earth would you think that? he's being a misogynist. NTA", "Agree!!\n\nNTA \nI'd hit him with a frying pan and say \" always have to knock something out before you cook it.\" \n\nNo but for real... I'm glad he's just a BF so there isn't any divorce papers to pay for.\n\nHe's just trying to feel better for himself and make you feel crazy for not talking to him.", "Yes. He showed her who he is.

Misogyny isn\u2019t a compliment?! /s", "NTA indeed. Like what's up with all these sexist guys lately? Am I the only one or is this becoming \"fashionable\" since one or two years? Don't get it.", "Slightly? That\u2019s straight up misogynistic.", "And also a single soon.", "Agreed and happy to have such a calm and supportive comment. They do need to discuss it and many other things before committing themselves to each other until death do they part. But he\u2019s 25. More than old enough to know what he said is based on outdated gender roles. Because she has a uterus and proper chromosomes she innately knows how to feed people better than he does? But not actually become a professional chef that runs a restaurant because that\u2019s man\u2019s work. A compliment is \u201cyum, you make the best Mac and cheese! Thank you so much for making dinner\u201d not \u201cyour gender predisposes you to feed others\u201d. Sorry for piling all this under your comment. Didn\u2019t want to make multiple comments. I really do love that you said they need to talk and discuss these things in depth (not necessarily at the restaurant while she was upset though). So many of these posts could be solved with good communication", "Thank you for this, almost the only visible comment more substantial than \"That is a misogynist comment!\" which it obviously is, but that wasn't the question\n\nSilent treatment and withdrawing is very juvenile, and also emotionally damaging/manipulative. Please at least try to express your feelings and talk...", "Agree with this an adding an ESH judgement", "Talk to him and demand an apology.", "No one \u201cjust\u201d knows how to cook\n\nIt\u2019s not something people are born knowing, they learn it", "Yes.", "Okay and? \n\nThey didn\u2019t know how to cook because they were women\n\nThey knew how to cook because they were taught\n\nThis comments doesn\u2019t address the post at all", "I agree.
