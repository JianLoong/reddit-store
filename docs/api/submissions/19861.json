Even if the response is generic like \"you didn't have enough experience\" or \"there were many very strong applications\" it's still good to know. \n\nI volunteer with a local foster care provider to assist youth transitioning out of care find employment, couple key things:\n\n- apply for jobs at your qualification lvl eg don't go for an AM position at JBHIFI if you don't have retail experience.\n\n- turn up to interviews early and looking clean and tidy eg jeans should not have rips, navel should not be showing and hair should be brushed\n\n- think of some meaningful questions to ask eg \"what would your expectations be of the person who is successful in this position\"\n\n- you can ask about salary and entitlements but only at the end of the interview eg \"if I am successful in this process when would you be looking for me to commence and what is the remuneration package\"\n\n- always thank the interviewer for taking time to meet with you\n\n- always have a response prepared for why you want the job.\n\nI know these tips seem straightforward but having interviewed many ppl in my life I can tell you 2/3 of newbies to the job market don't do them.", "Info: Are you applying to all *types* of entry level jobs? Is there a reason you aren't hireable?", "I hope you find one soon OP, any family members you can stay with till then?\n\nBtw NTA, you're barely an adult who has no job and your parents kick you out with less than an hour to pack? I'd personally go NC for the rest of my life, especially if they didn't bother raising me well in my childhood and kept criticizing me, then once they're no longer legally responsible for me they throw me out to fend for myself.", "That's not relevant your job apps.  Your parents are jerks for throwing u out like that", "I mean... I can imagine several scenarios, but OP didn't give us enough detail to do anything by speculate wildly.", "I feel your pain. It was my stepfather in this case, but I was forced to move out at 18, as I had been \"leeching off of them\" for so long. I was a pretty timid person, always walking around on eggshells around him, but no matter what I did, it was wrong. Hit me once for using what he thought was the wrong bottle of shampoo. \n\nI agree, in this case it was his own father, who is supposed to care for him and protect him. Fuck him, I don't understand how he thinks he should be celebrated by the son he threw out just a few weeks ago on an hour's notice, with very little to support him.", "I genuinely think it's harder to get \"non-skilled\" job than a professional one these days. \n\nIt always irritates me when media portrays anybody (but teens in particular) as being able to get a job, as though it was the easiest thing in the world.", "It does. As an educator I\u2019ve dealt with someone this year whose parents announced he had to leave when he turned 18. No other reason.", "Why does your dad even want you there if he won't even let you in his car and treats you like this? How aware is your grandma of the whole situation?", "My best revenge is living 30 miles away but not telling any of them where I moved to and planning to not lift a finger in support even tho my other sibling lives in another country.", "That is an awesome plan.  And how it should be.  You will give them as much support in their old age as they gave you as a child.", "My mum was v supportive growing up, but we\u2019re both abuse survivors and she treated me the same way as an adult as she was treated, so I have zero guilt"]}
