It's often very generic but the code is pretty easy to crack, for example:\n\n- it was a tough round with a lot of very qualified candidates = your skills are good but your presentation at the interview was poor.\n\n- we wanted someone with more experience = you aren't qualified for the position and your resume was misleading.\n\n- you were found suitable and are on our merit list = you performed well there was just someone who performed better.", "No he wasn't even home, he broke up with her when he got back and ended up moving in with my grandma. \n \nI went and found a house party and then slept at a park drunk.", "You've got some problems if that's your response mate.", "Bolted", "It's not very hard for an 18 year old to establish residence in the house they grew up in", "No, I'm half gay. Split right down the middle line a queer chimera. Rawr.", "Ah, downvoting the idea of not kicking your child out for being LGBTQ+.  Stay classy, weekend AITA.", "No explanation from mom why she moved things up 3 months and have you told dad?", "How do I prove I lived there though", "I told him he doesn\u2019t care his other family is more important", "I don't think you would really need much. Honestly I would post to r/legaladvice. They can direct you to the correct authorities to call or the type of lawyer to contact", "I am afraid for my safety if I do that", "INFO.  \nOK, I'm going to go against the general flow of responses here, and say I want some more information - I don't think we are getting anything like the full story.  \nYou say you live with your mother mostly and  your father sometimes, but then say your parents - i.e. both of them - kicked you out \"with less than a hour notice\". Which parent? If it's your mother, what does that have to do with celebrating Father's Day? How do both parents kick you out if they don't live in the same place? Your story isn't adding up.  \nYou've said you think it's because you can't find a job. Ok, question for you - what chores are you doing around the house? If you aren't working, and you aren't studying, where is your money coming from? You're saying you are struggling to get a job because of anxiety and \"other undiagnosed medical conditions\" - so my next question is, do your parents believe you have these conditions, or are they seeing it as you using excuses not to get a job and just sponge off of them?  \nYou've said you refuse to go to the FD luncheon because \"my parents just kicked me out and criticize everything I do...\" - every teen I've ever known, myself included, has whinged at some point about parents being unreasonable and over-critical when the kid gets called out on being lazy and entitled, behaving like there's a Housework Fairy who does things, or that it's child labour and unfair to expect them to do work around the house. So I want more details - what are you contributing to the house and exactly how are they being critical?  \nOver all, this could be one of two situations, and the gaps in your story lead me to think it's the second one here -  either your parents are utter shits and you owe them nothing, OR you have been lazy, refused to take ownership of your share of the housework, expected your parents to pay your way, dropped out of studying and are using excuses to not really look hard for work, nor doing anything to get help for any mental health issues you may (or may not actually) have, and your parents reached the end of their tether: one kicked you out and the other declined to let you move in with them, in the hope that it might shake you up out of your apathy.  \nSo until you clarify the situation, I'm going to withhold final judgement, but err on the side of YTA or ESH", "You're probably the asshole. What did you do for them to kick you out?", "Absolutely NTA, although I do wonder why they suddenly ousted you. I feel like there is part of the story missing. Regardless, I don\u2019t think someone who has kicked you out can expect a warm Father\u2019s Day celebration from you", "Which parent kicked you out?  Mom or dad or both?", "NTA why would you celebrate a man who kicked you out?", "INFO: Kicked you out for good or \"you can't be here today.\"", "> because my parents and grandma claims that my parents care about me and she said that everyone will miss my presence\n\nThen perhaps they should have thought about that before they tossed you out with no means to care for yourself.\n\nFathers day is to celebrate father who help and are supportive.\n\nWhere was your parents support when you needed it\nNTA", "NTA they miss your presence yet left you to struggle and suffer. Terrible parenting and it doesn't need to be celebrated. Keep working on you and getting a job.", "NTA. I'm so sorry. Hugs. Stay strong and good luck.", "Two sides to a story, there was a reason they kicked you out. I really doubt they only gave you an hour. Maybe they're giving you tough love. And don't tell me 18 is too young. I left home at 17, as soon as I graduated HS, got a roommate & job. Scrambled for years.", "You are young, and NTA. Don\u2019t feel bad. They are shaming you and (maybe) purposely setting you up for \u201cfailure\u201d again. I\u2019d have to know more about your childhood history, but it sounds akin to mine even in the present. Can\u2019t do anything right. Am always a disappointment, yet are never given tools to succeed. I can\u2019t know though from this short post. But all in all, keep your head up and focus on your health, safety, and well being during this critical time. If anyone interrogates on the \u201cwhy\u201d you cannot be around for \u201cluncheons\u201d (I\u2019m laughing here because the fancy side of my family did this same stuff when I was struggling and called them luncheons) tell them you are restructuring your life since you were cast out with only yourself to rely on.\n\nEdited: for crappy spelling after a beer.

I don't understand what your parents expected you to be able to do with that short of notice. Or did they tell you some time ago that it was their intention to have you leave, and then the day finally came and they did it? Anyway, if they really gave you no notice, they are ta for sure. I'm housing one of my kid's friends at the moment because his parents told him he was no longer welcome in their home due to him being an atheist. Crazy shit. Maybe one of your friends would have a sympathetic parent, in a similar fashion? Anyway, stay safe OP, and I hope things get better for you very soon.", "My dads \u201cnew family\u201d with his wife hates me and will not let me stay there.

At 18 and no job experience, the only jobs you\u2019ll be able to get will be shitty ones until you get experience under your belt. \n\nMy vote tho is NTA. No parent should kick their 18 year old child out unless they\u2019re doing something bizarre like trying to party all night, drugs, or even simple shit like not respecting their rules. Even as an adult, if you\u2019re living under someone else\u2019s roof, you have to respect their rules. If any of those apply to you, yeah I see why they kicked you out.

And if you do get an interview, they ghost you afterwards.  Good luck to your kids.", "I got a job today hopefully I can get another one soon but yeah my parents have always been assholes and I do have some expiercnce at a certain place that mother bread presides over", "That\u2019s a complicated question. I was parentified and basically raised him my whole life because my mom was never home, and my dad was out of the picture. Took him to speech therapy 5 days a week for years and didn\u2019t do any extracurriculars myself ever because of it, made his school lunches and made us dinner every day, talked to him about his life because my mom didn\u2019t care, tucked him in at night. \n\nI needed a break for a few years once I myself left at 18 to be my own person and to just be his sister. I myself was severely sexually abused from 7-18 by my moms bf (and eventually, she joined in). I needed to heal myself first for a bit, but then when I tried to help him out again he severely took financial advantage of me and tried to punch both me and my partner (for asking him why he suddenly started screaming at the top of his lungs in my bedroom he was crashing in - turns out he got banned from applying to a job he could have easily gotten, because he needed to wait a day or two to interview but instead just kept on reapplying the whole day thinking he could get an instant answer eventually even though we told him not to and that this would happen. He still blamed us).\n\nMy mom would also continuously be in a cycle with him where she\u2019d play the victim having the homeless child, eventually invite him to stay and say everything will be all better now, and then kick him out the next morning and say \u201cit\u2019s not me, my boyfriend doesn\u2019t want you here\u201d with the same boyfriend over and over again. She\u2019d make him use all the money he\u2019d save up, go several states away to her (when she made him homeless and kicked him out, she also instantly decided and moved into her bfs home that same week 3 states away). I didn\u2019t want to be part of that dynamic, and I was getting to the point where I needed NC with my mom (vs my brother still doesn\u2019t even realize what my mom did with making him homeless!!! She\u2019s convinced him by now that it\u2019s HIS choice, and he believes her because he loves her).\n\nWe haven\u2019t talked now in ~2 years, since he tried punching and left saying \u201cit\u2019s hard to be good, so I\u2019m just going to be bad\u201d. He never reached out to me after that (nor did he care about me as a person when he was at my place, I was just a warm bed to him), and I was tired of trying so hard my whole life with him. All I wanted growing up was a sibling, but he felt like my child. I still feel guilty about it, and I\u2019m not planning on having children because I felt like I never had a childhood due to raising him. \n\nI wish him the best, but I can\u2019t fight this cycle of abuse that he is still in with my mom, and I need to fully heal and do what\u2019s best for me", "Yeah I am trying to completey cut them off but I need some Time so I can get my documents and stuff", "Thanks", "Thank you so much op", "Yeah but I like my grandma and cousins but it\u2019s not enough to overcome that and feel normal", "OP you can do it, you'll find a job eventually, don't let this pull you down alright dude? Many people, including my father, struggled like you did but eventually they made it, my point is don't give up, don't let this tear you down and go NC with all these shitty family members if they all know your situation and won't even help a little bit. Are you sure they all know tho? Maybe your parents told them a different story?", "One has been trying to get a summer job & the other is a college grad trying to get a career job. Neither is having any luck! I feel soooo bad for them both. They're so frustrated!", "Holy shit. You've done more than enough, _especially_ after what was done to you. I'm so sorry your mother is so unspeakably evil. And I'm sorry about your brother. \n\nI'm glad, however, that you've accepted the reality that you couldn't help him even if you didn't have your own trauma to heal from. That is 100% the right decision and your strength amd humanity are incredibly impressive. This world is a better place other you in it, so please continue to care for yourself.", "See, heres the thing. No one here is emotionally invested in your situation. This isn\u2019t about you.

Don't wait, call them now.", "That really sucks, and you should never have been put in this position. But you are doing so well. You didn't give up. You went to your interview. You got the job. You did all of that while living in a car because your entire family screwed you over. I know it probably doesn't feel like it right now, but you are being the hero that you need.", "As the person who made that comment, I have never denied that some parents kick their kids out for shitty reasons.  But sometimes parents have to kick their adult kids out for very valid reasons.  Those situations can be heartbreaking, including for the parents who still love their child and want them to get help.\n\nHaving seen the devastation of both scenarios, there is no way I can pass judgment here without understanding the situation better.", "Yea, of course, end of their rope enough to end all support with an hours notice, but super broken up that he wouldn't attend a dinner.", "It's always hard to tell for certain when you're only getting one side of the story.", "The grandmother is the one pressuring OP to come, not the parents.  All we know is that the parents don\u2019t oppose the invitation to grandma\u2019s house, and have told OP that they still care about him."]}
