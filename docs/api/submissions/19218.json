Which, I did. \n\nThe girl was still not ready to come to the elevator, I have my dog on leash and he was sitting down, so I don't know what was the problem. Now, susan here started mocking me, telling me how I can't understand what she is saying again and again, back off, being educated but don't know shit (said to me) , not everyone likes dogs( which i understand), people get dogs but don't know nothing etc. You get the gist.\n\nI, well couldn't control myself and started shouting back about how I understood what she meant, I have backed off already. The guy came to me saying don't get hyper and all but bro, that was the first time I shouted at a stranger, she really made me miserable today.\n\nSo, For my peace of mind, it's important for me to understand that What I did was wrong or right, and how could I have defended myself in much better way.\n\nP.S : English is my second language.

I understand the kid might be scared but the family cannot expect you to leave the area completely to placate that.", "Ehhh, shouting probably wasn't the best way to handle it, but she was the one harassing you. NTA\n\nYou were already going above and beyond to be polite and courteous by letting them go first. You could have just taken the elevated and made them wait.\n\nIn terms of what you could do differently, it really depends. Your goal was to get the woman to stop harassing you. You had different options available to you, but all had their own risks\n\n1. Just walk away. Leave the building and wait for them to go up. \n   1. Pro: Minimal confrontation\n   2. Con: She essentially gets her way\n2. Calmly tell her to back off\n   1. Pro: Assertive without being aggressive\n   2. Con: She might well just ignore you\n3. Shout/say something rude to shock her into silence. Respond to her behavior in kind\n   1. Pro: She won't be able to ignore you\n   2. Con: It doesn't look good and makes the issue less black and white for anyone who comes along. A woman screaming at a man standing quietly with his dog looks crazy. A woman and a man screaming at each other *both* look crazy", "NTA and kids learn to be afraid of dogs by the interactions the adults in there lives have with them in their presence. That said, getting into a shouting match, isn\u2019t the best approach either. Next time around, try to be mindful of other alternatives to interacting with people who might display this type of behavior. Unfortunately, it\u2019s one of the downsides of pet ownership.", "NTA - you were trying to be very considerate by letting them go first when you were already there waiting for the elevator.  You did what you could, and they got rude with you.  I get that kids are sometimes scared of dogs, but that's for the parents to deal with.\n\nHonestly, next time, I'd just go into the elevator with the dog and let them come in if they want to.  Otherwise, they can wait for the elevator to come back down.", "NTA- some people are impossible, and their crotch spawn don\u2019t own the globe. You were much more kind then I would have been.", "NTA. I was walking up to my apartment with my 2 dogs(leashed and always behind me) and a neighbor(old man) came out of his door while I was already halfway up my 2 flights. He told me I needed to go back down and move so he could pass. Now, this guy is a DICK (this was not my first altercation with him, but first about the dogs), the apt management hates him and I heard him beating his wife on numerous occasions. I put him in his place real F\\*\\*ing quick. I have just as much right in this building as he does. He doesn't want the dogs near him than he can go back in his apartment until I pass. He doesn't pay my bills and he's damn sure not going to tell me what to do. He called me a slur in a different language(not knowing I understood) and I told him to stop beating his wife. Thankfully they finally moved out a couple months ago. I was talking to management and told her the story, she was so thrilled that I ripped him apart because she has wanted to for years, but couldn't. If you don't want to be around animals, don't live in an animal friendly building. If you're an irresponsible owner and your dog is an AH, that's something else.", "NTA. You were at the elevator first. They needed to stand back and wait for the next one.", "You don\u2019t have to say or do anything it is up to those adults to guide their spawn through fears not yours. Next time pretend like you don\u2019t see or hear them coming and focus on your dog with eye contact. That way your dog can ignore that bs as well plus it\u2019s good training for the dog.", "NTA. Sounds like you did all you could to give them space and move towards the elevator. Honestly might have just been a misunderstanding where the mother thought you didn't because of, I assume, a cramped corridor to the elevator. Still super not cool of her to be rude to you especially when you were trying to be polite. Honestly, you should've just gone up first and let them wait for the elevator.", "Life lesson: anger is a valid emotion but there are right and wrong ways of expressing your anger.\n\nYou chose the wrong way to express your anger, because by yelling you created a new problem: **you**.  There is no way that a person yelling at a woman with a young kid isn't going to come across as an out-of-control threat.  You are now the problem and you had to be dealt with.  Unfortunately in dealing with you, the original problem, ahole racist lady, never got addressed.\n\nYou can keep your cool and express your anger, with emotion, but calmly and get your point across. Had you done that you would never had been the problem people had to manage.  You would have come across as angry but in control and not a threat and the whole focus would have been on that ahole racist woman.\n\nESH,\n\nI don't care that you were mean to the woman, but the way you did it you hurt your own position.  She was an ahole to you and you were an ahole to yourself.", "NTA", ">I, well couldn't control myself and started shouting back... The guy came to me saying don't get hyper and all\n\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  \n\nShouting publicly where someone makes note of you \"getting hyper\"...? You've probably lost your shit for no reason. So that's where you've gone wrong.  The woman started ranting and assuming you couldn't understand the language, of course she's a rude asshole. \n\nThis was the \"first time you have shouted at a stranger\" and it only made you feel bad about your own behaviour, it didn't accomplish anything constructive. Ignore minor assholes like that.", "I think a little kid has every right to feel intimidated by a dog, even if it\u2019s sitting down at the moment. That being said, the parents sound like assholes and you certainly didn\u2019t need to get in a screaming match with them over it. Personally, I think ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Because the whole \"can't you understand me\" feels like it could be racism but depends on the circumstances.", "Exactly! The security guard was standing beside me when they were gone and we were both talking about how irrational some people can be. \n\nWhat did she want me to do? Stand outside the whole building? On the road?", "Thanks for the advice, I think the next time I would get the walk away route. I don't like her getting her way but hey, I don't care. My anxiety wouldn't allow me to get into confrontation. \n\nMaybe I'll try mocking her, although that wouldn't look good but If I'm not left with any choice, well...", "I encountered this downside long before, and i clearly understood that I have to be more responsible. You know, just like parents are responsible for their kids. \n\nThe first time I encountered a rude lady like her though.", "A dog attacked my face when I was 6. How is that due to interactions of adults in my life? Dogs have the potential to be dangerous and do serious harm.", "Not gonna lie, at first I thought they were being polite, letting me go first. When I understood them, I took my dog and backed off. \n\nParents were waiting for the little girl to come on her own when she was scared, I don't understand why they didn't try to console her and take her hand if they were so worried about my dog.", "If I may ask, how would you have handled this situation?", "Could have been a misunderstanding, no reason to start mocking my education and behaviour though. Next time I wouldn't even like to see their face, just walk away.", "I understand, thanks for this. Controlling my anger would help. I don't know why I did what I did, maybe it was because she also started yelling a little? \n\nAnyways, something I can work on, will keep in mind.", "I agree, as someone who has anxiety issues i shouldn't have done what I did. My legs started shaking (not visibly) when I was in the shouting match with her. \n\nThis incident was eye opening for me too, I never thought my anxiety issues were this serious. Taking your and my own advice, I wouldn't get into fights like this (it was my first time but that's no excuse) so yeah.", "I gave space for that reason only, I know people are intimidated by dogs, I understand.

Not as polite, but not necessarily wrong either.", "Do not mock her. You always have a choice. Just walk away", "Many more will make themselves known. It is what it is. Having control over your pet at all times is a never ending, but necessary, loop.", "That\u2019s unfortunate. Any pet can have the potential to cause an injury. But if parents act frightened or get anxious every time they encounter people in public spaces with pets, they teach children to be fearful and anxious too. Being cautious and being frightful are two separate actions. One engenders constant fear while the other fosters being aware and mindful of the energy that you give off when animals are in your immediate vacinity.", "I would have made it clear that I was accommodating them which I have no obligation to do. Being scared for no reason is their problem has nothing to do with me or my dog, it\u2019s poor parenting. Tell them to be polite or their child will resent them, or turn out like them, neither of those are good scenarios. Probably a few expletives in there as well.", "Yeah fr not worth it"]}
