Mom is wrong-o here.  Whatever fuels her resentment that baby wants her parents when she's upset is neurotic.

You are supposed to hover over your infant!! The idea that babies get \"too attached\" to parents has been totally debunked, and even if it hadn't, you and your gf are your daughter's mom and dad. You get to decide how you raise her top to bottom. You should tell your mom she doesn't have to agree with how you parent, but she has to respect it and keep her comments to herself if she wants to be around her granddaughter.", "NTA.

You never, never snatch the baby from the parent.\n\nGet your wife one of those things where she \"wears\" the baby.

A regular transgression of mothers-in-law seems to be that they won't hand back the baby to the parents, once they've got their mits on them. It seems to be a function of them thinking that they know best, or at any rate more than the actiual parents. It is a big no-no. It is very possible that they have more experience with babies, but for one, they are not parents to the grandkids, and for another, the babies know who their parents are, and that is who they want, when they are uncomfortable and upset. So, yes, granny you are the A H if you hog the baby after the parents have asked you to hand him/her back. No, baby's daddy NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mom has serious control issues if she got that upset over giving **your own baby** back to you so you could resolve what was causing the baby to cry.\n\nIf her \"help\" is so strictly contingent upon her having absolute control over your baby, it's better to find someone else to help.\n\nYour mom is obviously the AH here.", "As a mom you NEVER keep a crying baby away from their mother who is best equipped to resolve said issues with the crying baby.

Doesn't matter who it is and how much of a veteran they think they are, when a parent asks for their crying child back, you hand kiddo over. No arguing, no getting up and walking away.

You and your wife handled that better than I would have. Sje needs to realize this isn't her baby. Her wants have no relevance. If a parent asks for their kid back you give them their kid.

Don't leave her unattended with your child.", "NTA. This is very strange and she's acting terribly. If parents want to hold their own baby, you give the baby back to them. These are psycho-grandma vibes.", "NTA.  Parents get access to their baby whenever they want for whatever reason.  For grandparents, access is a PRIVILEGE, not a right.  If grandma cannot accept that simple boundary, she is not a safe person to have around your baby at all.", "NTA \n\nYou are the parent and what you say is pretty much law. \n\nYour mother's text is beyond out of line.

It sounds like your mother has a very different philosophy about parenting infants than you do. Too bad, it's the baby's parents that get to make the decisions.\n2. I also agree with your judgment. Four months is a little young, and nowhere in your post do you write that your child has cholic or some other reason why you shouldn't think soothing her would actually work. And at that age, it's important to tell infants that they are going to be soothed, that's how they learn self-soothing in the first place. The idea that ignoring a crying baby is the way to foster independence is becoming outdated in the United States.\n\nSo NTA", "NTA. You are the parents and you set the rules, and this is a very reasonable boundary. In the future you need to set a consequence for this boundary stomping, like no more holding baby again that visit. Good luck going forward and congrats on being new parents.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a grandmother, and if I was holding a baby that was upset and the parents signaled that they'd like to take over, I would NEVER consider saying no. Doesn't matter if it's my grandchild or a different baby. The baby belongs to the parents, not to me.\n\nIf the parent indicated that they *wanted* me to continue trying to soothe the baby, then sure, I'll give it a go.\n\nThis is your baby. Your mom had her chance with her own babies. It's great that she wants to help, but not if her help comes in ways that you are not comfortable with. If you continue to have issues like this, you might have to have a sit-down, kind conversation with your mom to draw some boundaries.", "NTA.

Did say to her don\u2019t you fking look at me like that when she was giving me the angry eyes and I was saying I\u2019m her parent and then gave her back to mom because the baby was hungry/tired.", "OPs girlfriend. I could most definitely tell my daughters cry was abnormal and she needed something or else I would of let her try to soothe her. It was when I sat down beside them to try and be there too that she got up and walked away with my wailing daughter, is what got us most upset.", "If you kept my phone from me when I wanted it back I'd be pissed. If you kept my BABY from me when I wanted them back, I would probably bite you.\n\nIt's not \"helicoptering\" to soothe your own infant.", "No, they can\u2019t trust someone who doesn\u2019t return their baby when told to.", "This is not about helicoptering. This is about asserting authority over her child and his child (her grandchild). When you\u2019re a parent you learn to tell the difference in your baby\u2019s cries. Grandma needs to take a seat and learn to let her child, who is an ADULT, be a parent. \n\nMy exMIL tried pulling this business with me and calling me a helicopter for tuning into what my baby\u2019s different cries meant. OP was completely in the right to tell his mom to knock it off. His mom does not get a say in how the baby is raised.", "OPs girlfriend. It was more then just her being upset, it was a cry we had only heard a handful of times so far so I knew she needed me. I would of been okay with her trying to soothe her if I knew she was just being a little fussy.", "Might be one thing if the baby was older but as per post 4month old were talking about she only knows who her parents are and if she\u2019s maybe met the person she\u2019s seeing before not who\u2019s who and her parents are obviously a source of comfort at such a young age could maybe understand if she was closer to a year old but she doesn\u2019t know who my mother is just that she was holding her and she was hungry and tired, diddnt want to be with my mother at the time which she really voiced being a baby and yeah my mom was being difficult not about being protective which obviously we are of her lol but just saying", "Man I misread the title and was so confused but ready to come in calling you an AH. After re-reading the title and the post I was like how? How would this person be an AH at all. NTA and congrats on your bundle of joy!", "Hey, I just want to let you know that you\u2019re doing a great job! It is so hard to juggle family relationships especially when you have a new baby. The most important thing to think about is what is best for baby? You are her voice right now. Is it more important for her to be around a selfish woman that puts her needs over your baby\u2019s? Just because she\u2019s her grandmother? Or is it better to keep your distance and know that your daughter is safe and well taken care of? I cut off a few toxic people after my daughter was born. It wasn\u2019t easy but it was the right thing to do for her. \n\nSo young, your baby doesn\u2019t need anyone but you and her dad. The extras are nice to have if they\u2019re good people who will respect boundaries. If they won\u2019t, they\u2019ll do more harm than good at this stage. \n\nYou can\u2019t \u201chover\u201d over an infant. You can\u2019t love them too much. You can\u2019t spoil them. \n\nHang in there! Family shit is tough and complicated.", "You limit and monitor all interactions she has with your child, at least until your child is old enough to say no to her and express to you when there are problems.\n\nWhen you have to deal with her, be overly firm and confident in taking your child.  \u201cOK sweet baby, mama\u2019s here, I have you\u201d and take your baby.  Immediately say you all have a good system in place, and go do your thing.  She\u2019ll huff and puff, but in the end you guys are the parents.  \n\nIf she gets insistent, remind her this is your family and you do things differently because that\u2019s what is best for your family.  \n\nYou and your BF are doing great!  Keep supporting each other, and keep loving your baby and you will do fabulously.", "Same thing happened to me with my MIL. Then I learned about boundaries, game changer.", "You did great!! Seriously awesome job advocating for your little family. I promise it gets easier to hold your boundaries with practice. I was anxious a lot my daughter\u2019s first year because I worried about hurting other people\u2019s feelings when I stuck up for myself. By the time my second and now third came along, I was over that and now have no problem speaking up when I need to.", "Totally understand! And good for you guys, you sound like caring and loving parents.\n\nIt\u2019ll pass. Grandma will get over the \u201cdon\u2019t tell ME, I\u2019ve done this before!\u201d that is surely in her head right now. I\u2019m confident she\u2019ll see the loving parents and great baby and swallow that little bit of pride stuck in her craw right now. She\u2019s flailing about trying to be a part of it is all, don\u2019t hold it against her too terribly I hope!", "Totally understand! We were there too.\n\nHeck, my first was a GIRD baby, wicked reflux. Poor thing. Her first year was just miserable. If you didn\u2019t hold her right (had to be vertical and just so), or swing her right, poor thing would pretty much be screaming instantly. We had some\u2026. Not so fun\u2026 conversations. Try correcting your own mother on how to hold a baby, haha, didn\u2019t go well! But correct her (and everyone else) we did, and had some knock down drag outs in the process - all did end well, tho, as I\u2019m confident this will, too.", "Except the mother was bitter according to the post. And the commenter you are replying to literally said nothing about traumatizing a child. They just say it makes the most sense to return the child to the mom.", "Thanks so much for your validation! I definitely need some space and time away from her after this situation. I will never be sorry for loving my child too much! No such thing! Thankfully my parents are absolutely amazing and when told about the situation said \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that happening here\u201d", "That\u2019s the thing too I could understand if the baby was fussing but our sweet little gem is so happy 95% or the time that when she actually is upset you know it\u2019s about something not just crying for no reason and she was WAILING in my mothers arms honestly haven\u2019t heard her cry like that before and hope she doesn\u2019t again", "Did you see the other comments by this person?", "Relations with grandparents can be a beautiful thing, but they can also be toxic and unhealthy. While this grandma has time to make genuine amends and change her behavior, if her view of being grandma means disregarding the baby\u2019s parents and their parenting style and she continues then OP os well within rights to limit or discontinue entirely that contact. \n\nBeing a grandparent is a privilege and not a right. You have to earn your place in the child\u2019s life with your actions and your words.", "If it helps\u2026 that same mom I had those drag outs with is also the most loving grandma and so supportive. She \u201csneaks\u201d funds to my kids (both in college now) to give them a little extra help. \n\nYour mom is probably struggling right now with wanting to help, with those feelings of \u201coh, I did this before\u201d, and reconciling that to your boundaries. It\u2019ll settle out. She wouldn\u2019t be upset if she didn\u2019t care.", "Yes have you? Please show me where she said traumatized? She said she that the mother hurt those involved, she said infant was in distress, but nowhere does she say anything that this child will be traumatized for a few minutes away. But it would have been easier and a lot less stressful to just give the parents back their damn baby when asked.", "Really not trying to drag my own mother through the mud here but as nice as the potential of her being there for something like this^ the reality isn\u2019t there I can just try to monitor her as best as I can and try to decide if the cost fallacy outweighs the guaranteed shenanigans that will come from continuing a relationship with her but I can just try for her mental sake and for my child to have that grandparent on my side as I don\u2019t speak to my father at all. Girlfriends parents are amazing they\u2019re the parents I wish I had growing up though so the baby has atleast 2 solid grandparents at the moment.", "NTA - your mom is the type that gets talked about over on the JustNoMIL subreddit and you handled this wonderfully. If she chooses not to visit because you set a reasonable boundary that\u2019s honestly not a loss.", ">Only for my mother to blow back up at me and tell me to keep my control and she\u2019s done trying to help us not hover over the baby all the time? \n\nWhat? Hover over the baby? Okay. You know, when someone says something that irrational, you can accept they've got something going on and you csn ignore them. NTA.", "NTA why do grandparents think they\u2019re entitled to their childrens kids??? It\u2019s YOUR CHILD not HERS. She can get over herself", "NTA I would do the same thing with my son. However I both breastfeed and pump so if I have people visiting they can feed him too. It honestly helps take the pressure off me to always be on and gives a short break.  I have a down and dirty check list. Baby crying check diaper\u2026 clean okay still crying try a bottle\u2026. Baby doesn\u2019t want the bottle\u2026.. might have a burp or fart so try to burp him if no burp comes out hold him with one arm and put my hand cupped under his butt and shake it aka baby twerk. Usually a man sized fart comes out he is happy.", "NTA. Your baby your rules. Period. You need to set that boundary so your girlfriend doesn\u2019t have to. You\u2019re a dad now. Parenting is hard. You might as well get used to setting boundaries with people now because it\u2019s not going to get easier. It sucks it\u2019s your mom but she raised her kids now you need to do what\u2019s best for yours.", "op=NTA\n\nParents get to decide who's holding 4 month old baby.", "NTA", "NTA. You are the parents not her.  She needs to learn to respect the parents.  I've seen this go downhill, I would set clear guidelines about grandparent rules and behavior.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI would tell my mother very sternly with angry eyes right back at her to hand that baby over right now, and if she doesn\u2019t she is going to be put on no holding the baby probation. She does not get to barge in and take over and demand practice at soothing a very unhappy baby who just wants his mother, or father.   \nShe had her turn when she had you and does not get to take over your baby in any way ever. Everything is at your discretion at this point and your mother has no right to overule you as that babys parent.

Grandma doesn't get to make decisions like that. If Baby needs you she needs to give baby back.
