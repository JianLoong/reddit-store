Mom is wrong-o here.  Whatever fuels her resentment that baby wants her parents when she's upset is neurotic.  Babies are meant to want their parents and giving them what they need is supposed to be natural.\n\nMom is 100% wrong for criticising you and your wife for \"hovering over the baby\".", "NTA - even if you're a grandparent, if you are holding someone else's baby and they ask you to give the baby back to them for any reason, not to give the baby back makes you TAH. \n\nAlso, speaking as a new mom myself, your mom's idea that she has to \"help you\" not \"hover\" over your 4-month-old infant is...absurd. You are supposed to hover over your infant!! The idea that babies get \"too attached\" to parents has been totally debunked, and even if it hadn't, you and your gf are your daughter's mom and dad. You get to decide how you raise her top to bottom. You should tell your mom she doesn't have to agree with how you parent, but she has to respect it and keep her comments to herself if she wants to be around her granddaughter.", "NTA.  Your mother is being very controlling.  You always give the baby back to the parent.  You never, never snatch the baby from the parent.\n\nGet your wife one of those things where she \"wears\" the baby.  Don't give the baby to your mother until she apologizes and proves that she will behave in the future.\n\nBe firm in your boundaries or your mother will get worse.\n\nYou could go to r/JUSTNOMIL for more advice.", "I sometimes follow a subreddit called justnomil or something like that. A regular transgression of mothers-in-law seems to be that they won't hand back the baby to the parents, once they've got their mits on them. It seems to be a function of them thinking that they know best, or at any rate more than the actiual parents. It is a big no-no. It is very possible that they have more experience with babies, but for one, they are not parents to the grandkids, and for another, the babies know who their parents are, and that is who they want, when they are uncomfortable and upset. So, yes, granny you are the A H if you hog the baby after the parents have asked you to hand him/her back. No, baby's daddy NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mom has serious control issues if she got that upset over giving **your own baby** back to you so you could resolve what was causing the baby to cry.\n\nIf her \"help\" is so strictly contingent upon her having absolute control over your baby, it's better to find someone else to help.\n\nYour mom is obviously the AH here.", "As a mom you NEVER keep a crying baby away from their mother who is best equipped to resolve said issues with the crying baby. I\u2019d be pissed if I was your girlfriend. Unfortunately this is a real issue that many of us new generation moms are facing from our mothers/mils/extended female family members. NTA. Your mother had no right and she\u2019d have to earn baby privileges back.", "NTA - but I would have called her out right there, not texted her later on... at that point, it was already over. This stuff needs handled immediately, or it will never end...", "NTA idk what it is with MILs, but they seem to forget that they are not the parent of their grandchildren.", "NTA. Doesn't matter who it is and how much of a veteran they think they are, when a parent asks for their crying child back, you hand kiddo over. No arguing, no getting up and walking away. Just hand the kid over. \n\nYou two weren't helicoptering. You were trying to respond to your child's needs. Her bruised ego will survive.", "NTA. You and your wife handled that better than I would have. Sje needs to realize this isn't her baby. Her wants have no relevance. If a parent asks for their kid back you give them their kid. End of discussion. You don't tell them no, love away, or glare at them. \n\nI saw your comment on another post that your mother has BPD that she doesn't or won't take meds for. Don't leave her unattended with your child.", "NTA. This is very strange and she's acting terribly. If parents want to hold their own baby, you give the baby back to them. These are psycho-grandma vibes.", "NTA.  Parents get access to their baby whenever they want for whatever reason.  For grandparents, access is a PRIVILEGE, not a right.  If grandma cannot accept that simple boundary, she is not a safe person to have around your baby at all.", "NTA \n\nYou are the parent and what you say is pretty much law. \n\nYour mother's text is beyond out of line. I'd reply with \"please don't disrespect my family in my home. Please don't come back till you apologise\"\n\nYour mum needs to stay in her lane.", "NTA you\u2019re mom needs to respect your boundaries as parents.

It sounds like your mother has a very different philosophy about parenting infants than you do. Too bad, it's the baby's parents that get to make the decisions.\n2. I also agree with your judgment. Four months is a little young, and nowhere in your post do you write that your child has cholic or some other reason why you shouldn't think soothing her would actually work. And at that age, it's important to tell infants that they are going to be soothed, that's how they learn self-soothing in the first place. The idea that ignoring a crying baby is the way to foster independence is becoming outdated in the United States.\n\nSo NTA", "NTA. You are the parents and you set the rules, and this is a very reasonable boundary. In the future you need to set a consequence for this boundary stomping, like no more holding baby again that visit. Good luck going forward and congrats on being new parents.", "NTA.\n\nI'm a grandmother, and if I was holding a baby that was upset and the parents signaled that they'd like to take over, I would NEVER consider saying no. Doesn't matter if it's my grandchild or a different baby. The baby belongs to the parents, not to me.\n\nIf the parent indicated that they *wanted* me to continue trying to soothe the baby, then sure, I'll give it a go.\n\nThis is your baby. Your mom had her chance with her own babies. It's great that she wants to help, but not if her help comes in ways that you are not comfortable with. If you continue to have issues like this, you might have to have a sit-down, kind conversation with your mom to draw some boundaries.", "NTA. Time to set clear boundaries and not let her see the kid for some days. And whenever she does this, tell her to leave.", "NTA - Your baby. Your rules. End of story.", "This gonna end up on r/JUSTNOMIL", "NTA. If this was my mom, I wouldn't talk to her or allow her to see my child for at least a year.

I always side with the parents especially bc we know better so we do better so old school isn\u2019t always correct. However if mom is BPD it\u2019s another reason I would pick my battles with her. You have reason to be concerned but I would tread lightly especially bc with her condition I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll ever (fair enough) be comfortable with her doing an overnight without you. That\u2019s gonna be a battle you need to fight so maybe don\u2019t harangue her when she makes a small mistake. Makes sense? I\u2019m not shading you but family is always a mix bag of good and bad.

I do want her to know her grandma and vice versa but it\u2019s also a two way street. But then again I\u2019ve left some out but she\u2019s already pulled enough since the baby was born to warrant NC but I\u2019ve been trying to be the better person and keep the option available for her to be a piece of her granddaughters life just won\u2019t let her be traumatic while she\u2019s there either", "Fair enough and maybe a sit down talk is necessary. Only you know your mom and your kid. Trust yourself but be aware that if this isn\u2019t what you want for your kid make a last will and be smart. No shade bc I get it family can be amazing or they can be debilitating. With a new born you already have your hands full so I only wish you the best."]}
