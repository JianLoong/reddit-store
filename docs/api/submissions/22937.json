Sounds like you over-exaggerated and turned up the drama to 11 to try to **gain sympathy** from the room instead of brushing it off and continuing on.....like a graceful adult would.\n\nWhat a pouty baby, life gets harder than granny you know! Better learn to grow up fast!", "This generation's mantra:\n\n>*Everything I don't like is abuse. But, I can abuse anyone I don't like, if I label them a Nazi, like those MAGA assholes I don't like. I hope everyone abuses them!*", "agree the public part would make GM TA, but if she was frustrated OP and parents were feeding her to death it would be a legitimate concern.", "like i said, respect is something you earn. it sounds like you have some sort of childhood trauma you\u2019re now inflicting on me, a graceful adult would keep their mouth shut and not comment on a child\u2019s body in the first place", "abuse (verb): to treat (a person or an animal) with\u00a0cruelty\u00a0or violence, especially regularly or repeatedly.\n\nNothing to do with mantras or political ideology. It's only people like you who think it's okay when it's circumstances you support."]}
