I'm 5 months pregnant and the room needs some work- furniture and guest bed removed, sickeningly bright green walls repainted, carpet deep cleaned. At the time he agreed. Well it turns out not only did he NOT take any additional time off himself (he has weeks and weeks of unused vacation), he has made plans to spend Christmas with his (Jewish) parents. They apparently invited him since he didn't get to visit on his dad's birthday or Hanukkah because of COVID in their household. I just found all this out today when I said we should start the nursery on Christmas day, since we usually visit my family on Christmas Eve and I'll be busy Saturday doing last minute shopping and wrapping.\n\nI'm floored. My husband chose to disregard our plans and spend the holiday with people who DO NOT celebrate it rather than with his wife who DOES. And he wasn't planning to tell me about it.

I\u2019d then ask them as a Christmas present to arrive with all their vehicles. I\u2019d ask them to help me pack up all my belongings including my child\u2019s and the nursery.

About insurance honestly idk could be the same but he seems to be avoiding it for some reason.\n\nMaybe the reason to go alone( which is incredible wrong by his part ) is to think things through ( again christmas for him should be a  normal day )\n\nIf I got so many questions from your POV honestly is worrisome\n\nI am not saying Husband is an angel or anything but there seems to be too much missing context for this.

Let all calls that you don't know, or that you know are them, go to voice mail.  Save these in case you need evidence, but don't return them if they are abusive, or maybe not at all.  Probably just tell him and his family to call your lawyer.\n\nIf your aren't ready to go straight to divorce, I suggest that you tell him that you would consider counseling, but that you will not move back with him until you are satisfied that there is substantial change.

I thought that if she could give him a clear indication that life is moving forward and he can choose either to be apart of his child\u2019s life or not.  If OP spends her pregnancy angry and arguing with her husband, her health will suffer.  Her husband needs to put on his big boy pants and father up.  Otherwise, OP will have documented examples of husband\u2019s disinterest in their child even before birth so when she files for divorce and sole custody it will be a slam dunk.", "It is, people can not believe in God and follow a religion's traditions out of habit because that was how they were raised. \n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Christians", "It's no less a thing than being a Jewish atheist...", "babe I'm sorry.

Depending on how he was raised it may feel \u201cwrong\u201d to even discuss the baby or read parenting books before the baby is 8 days old. Jewish superstition and values instill no prepping for the baby. You mention a traumatic childhood. This could be a manifestation of religious trauma showing as apathy for the baby. I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s right.

And God says \"oh yeah, wait till you hear what mine did!\"\n\nChill. Nobody is saying OP should phrase it like that.

His Jewish family friends, many themselves Jewish moms, are sympathetic to my situation. One has told me on multiple occasions that his mom is often \"like a pitbull with something clenched in it's jaw, she doesn't let go\".

Give the baby your maiden name and bail. \n\nSpeaking from experience. My MIL said terrible things about me to my own family after I had our eldest son and never apologized. She would show up unannounced while I was still having postpartum bleeding and engorged boobs. She would take my colicky newborn out of my arms when I had finally gotten him to sleep. She was awful. If my husband didn\u2019t land a job that took us hundreds of miles away from her, I\u2019d be divorced. Now she just passive aggressively misspells my name on Christmas packages.", "I honestly have no idea how you went through with the wedding after that.

I had these in laws they worked very hard, along with their son, to break me. They almost succeeded. I beg of you get professional help now before it\u2019s a dire post partum depression issue that has them going to court for custody because they think they know better (happened to a friend of mine). My soon to be ex in-laws think they won because I\u2019m \u201cout\u201d. Best joke is on them because I am finally working on being mentally healthy and happy! Not saying you have to leave but I beg of you to get support ready and prepared in the mental health department prior to baby coming.

I wish you a healthy pregnancy, birth and baby.", "Not the case for him- he criticized to me a close friend for not preparing their nursery ahead of time knowing the mom was high risk with her BP since the baby could easily come early. He was right, baby did come early, and they were scrambling to get their shit together while already exhausted from the stress of her condition and the birth. I am also high risk due to age and a congenital condition he could pass and he knows this.", "Does he actively practice the religion or just for his parents I wonder. Cause she mentions weed, is that allowed? Pardon my lack of knowledge.", "I agree about the therapy. I think it's needed here.", "As a Jew who used to be married to a Christian, it is astonishing what Christians will say to Jews even when they know what they are saying is offensive to them. And it wasn\u2019t just my spouse that did it, it was most of the Christians we knew as well. So I don\u2019t take these things for granted anymore. I\u2019ve seen and been on the receiving end of some pretty insensitive crap.

But I definitely agree with the spirit of all you're saying.", "100% - I'd have canceled the wedding right there.", "The child wasn't planned and it wasn't certain what I would do about it the first few weeks. I honestly thought I was a bit old for one, plus husband has a congenital deformation that could be either genetic or environmental and we don't know which it was. His case was luckily not very serious, but it can be quite bad. I found out the limit for termination in my state and have figured that as long as she gets a reasonably clean bill of health before then, I'm excited to have her. I hope that doesn't sound ableist, but especially with his condition we would not be capable of adequately caring for a child with major disability either practically or financially. As it is he already cannot safely carry a baby while walking. Whatever ends up happening with my husband I am very lucky to still have both parents and they're supportive.", "That\u2019s Harsh and unhelpful since shes married and having a child and realizes her marriage is in trouble and asked for advice. Merry Christmas", "I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s acting like this. Sounds like a do as I say not as I do situation. Not preparing but critical of those who don\u2019t. Therapy seems like necessity at this point. Based on your other comments his family seems pretty dysfunctional. My late husband\u2019s family pulled a lot of crap. Only thing that helped us was therapy. Only way he went to therapy was as an ultimatum.
