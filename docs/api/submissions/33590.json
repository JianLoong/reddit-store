A few weeks ago I mentioned I was getting two extra days off from work at the holiday and that I thought we should use the time to start prepping the nursery. I'm 5 months pregnant and the room needs some work- furniture and guest bed removed, sickeningly bright green walls repainted, carpet deep cleaned. At the time he agreed. Well it turns out not only did he NOT take any additional time off himself (he has weeks and weeks of unused vacation), he has made plans to spend Christmas with his (Jewish) parents. They apparently invited him since he didn't get to visit on his dad's birthday or Hanukkah because of COVID in their household. I just found all this out today when I said we should start the nursery on Christmas day, since we usually visit my family on Christmas Eve and I'll be busy Saturday doing last minute shopping and wrapping.\n\nI'm floored. My husband chose to disregard our plans and spend the holiday with people who DO NOT celebrate it rather than with his wife who DOES. And he wasn't planning to tell me about it. I already knew he struggles to ever say no or set boundaries with his overbearing parents (who could have easily scheduled time Friday or Saturday before Xmas Eve or next week to gather), but this seems so beyond anything I would have expected from him. I'm starting to feel like we're not even married anymore. He didn't consult me on his plans for *Christmas*. He's leaving me alone that day and the next to deal with the nursery *on my own*. I've had to nag him every other week for the last two months to start checking out local daycares since I'm swamped at work and his workload is relatively light (he finally got info from ONE daycare). I've nagged him for the last two months to look into life insurance in consideration of the baby but he hasn't. I'm starting to feel Iike I might as well be alone. He's sheepishly tried to apologize but I won't speak to him and am genuinely wondering if this relationship is coming to an end. Our anniversary was a few months ago and the day before he realized he double booked himself and canceled our dinner to go to his grandmother's birthday dinner. He never rescheduled anything for us. Am I overreacting? AITA for not being open to an apology that doesn't involve cancelling plans with his parents (which I know he will not)??\n\nEDIT because it's been mentioned a few times: husband's parents do not have their own Christmas day tradition. We have been together several years and he has not historically visited them. They are making up for missing Hanukkah, which they could have asked to do on several days other than Christmas.", "created_utc": 1703285236, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18or36x/aita_for_refusing_to_speak_to_my_husband_over_his/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If setting up the nursery was important to him, he would do it.  Ask friends and neighbors if they have older teen children or children home for winter break from college who want to earn money by setting up the nursery.  This way you get to pick the colors, furniture, theme, etc.  Also, paint the walls before cleaning the carpet.  If he says he wants to do the work then that\u2019s fine.

You aren\u2019t religious, so celebrating the holiday with your family is just about traditions. Many Jewish families do have traditions (Christmas) beyond celebrating Hanukkah. It\u2019s very common for people to get together, watch movies, and take advantage of a day where most are off work. It\u2019s not religious in any way\u2026.but neither is your Christmas. So his traditions are just as important as yours. Have you even asked about his family\u2019s traditions?  \n\nYou say you\u2019re going to Christmas Eve at your family\u2019s house, so why not Christmas at his family\u2019s. Neither of your celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday so why does one tradition trump the other? \n\nHave you guys even discussed religion? Do you know if he wants to raise your child Jewish? Have you approached your in-laws to learn about Jewish culture so you can help your child embrace it? \n\nHe sucks (just not as much) because he should have communicated and let you know his plans.  You make a point of saying he didn\u2019t consult you about his plans, but did you consult him about yours?", "YTA. Not speaking to someone generally = asshole.\n\nPlus, I have very little patience for people who decide the way they celebrate the holidays takes precedence over the way someone else does. You don't see it as meaningful, but they do.", "Wow, you come off as very anti-semitic to your jewish husband. And how can you be a Christian atheist? You either believe in god or you don't. But that's just your words and how you ever want to delude yourself more to it. So obviously you don't like his parents, you have a problem with them being Jewish and visiting on December 25th. 25th. Only Christmas to Christians. And you also seem to be an annoying nag as you mentioned that you've done it for weeks. And of course you're busy than he is and he doesn't do anything. And you still have 4 months before the baby's born and you do not have to do the nursery yourself your chosen to do it. So so you already feel alone and I'm pretty sure he feels the same thing from you. Who wants to be constantly nagged and then when they try to apologize you end up not talked to them and complaining about everything. And then his family means nothing to you and your family is everything. The only one I truly pity is the baby. Because you're going to be a single mother who's going to try to stick him for the most child support you can get.\n\nYta", "I\u2019m confused. You\u2019re an atheist.

We had houseguests last week who had a really lovely, well behaved, and interesting little kid, and after they left he said \"how do we make ours like that?\". I told him to start reading the parenting book I bought him (bought weeks ago, he hasn't picked it up). The single best thing he could do is heal from his own traumatic upbringing but he can't see that. I can't even get him to leave his weed in the garage, it keeps finding its way back into the house.

The point is that it's just another day for them.\n\nIt's true though that I don't like his parents. They said a lot of nasty things about me and to me when I planned our wedding. I wanted a small backyard wedding but that wasn't \"good enough\" for them.

Eventually his mom decided to rent a party bus for the friends they invited so she could throw a \"real party\" before the event. She even skipped family pictures I arranged at a local historic building beforehand to be on her party bus. Well of course the bus broke down and they were an hour late to our wedding.

Strike two, not putting any effort; rebooking date, helping with day care, etc.\nI think he doesn't think you would leave him or he doesn't care.

My ex didn\u2019t really get it until our son actually arrived.  I was going through the pregnancy, my body was changing, I had an idea of how our lives would be impacted but it took him awhile to realize he wouldn\u2019t have the time and latitude to be at my MIL\u2019s beck and call anymore.  (She was needy and codependent and he was indulgent.)  He did figure it out when the exhaustion but also love and nurturing instincts for our son kicked in, and he just didn\u2019t have the bandwidth any more to deal with inane foolishness and had to train his mother to develop more reasonable expectations of his time and priorities. \n\nNot sure if your husband will get there\u2026but you need to give him a dose of reality and the two of you need counseling ASAP if you want to salvage this.", "I think you should add that the father\u2019s family doesn\u2019t have any traditions.

But I would encourage you to still be involved somewhat, since many things are Jewish customs celebrated by people who aren\u2019t religious and just identify as culturally Jewish. I don\u2019t mean you should be super involved, but plan to celebrate things like your child\u2019s bat/bar mitzvah and helping celebrate cultural holidays. And dad should do the same for you. He should help celebrate Christmas, since it seems like a cultural holiday for you, and other things you celebrate. It will benefit your child for you to both be a team rather than each having a separate side.", "I am \"welcome\" (read: tolerated) if not explicitly invited, it's just understood that I don't care to attend events with his parents ever since our wedding. They said a lot of ugly things to and about me during that time, upset that I was planning a backyard wedding which they felt was beneath them. They called me (among many other things) dense, a hillbilly, low class, etc. Eventually his mother decided to rent a party bus to usher her friends to the event and throw a \"real party\" on the way. They skipped family pictures at a local historical mansion beforehand to be on her party bus. The bus ended up breaking down making them an hour late, and my husband made us wait for them. His parents have never apologized or taken accountability for taking an hour of our wedding from us, and I have never forgiven them. If I'm being honest, I don't think I've forgiven my husband for making us wait either.\n\nAnyway, spending time with a baby is an excellent idea.", "Thanks, I updated with the edit. Yes, I always planned to support if he ever took the very first step of even visiting a local synagogue. I have even told him how many are in the area and what \"sects\" they are (not sure if that's the right word lol). I've just stressed to him that I will not be driving that car, as I seem to end up doing with... basically everything (beyond the basic maintenance of the home, which he does stay on top of as he works from home)."]}
