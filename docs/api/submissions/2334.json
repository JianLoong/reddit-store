My kid was an avid reader, no way would I take a book she bought (& she bought a lot of her own.

I was afraid they wouldn't give it back until they were done. \n\nI found something I was interested in on Etsy and thought you might like it too. You can get a stamp with your name, \"From the library of X\", with ink or to emboss the page. While your mother would have to open your book to see it, it's a fairly good way to mark something as unequivocally yours. Sometimes seeing someone else's name on something is a good reminder that it's not your property. \n\nI wouldn't do any of the revenge loaning out things that people are suggesting. Your mother hasn't yet realized that you have your own possessions and that she doesn't own them. If you start loaning out her stuff she may take everything of yours away. It won't teach her the lesson that needs to be taught. \n\nDo keep asking for the book back though. \"I would like to have my property, that I bought and paid for, returned to me.\" Nothing else. Reasons are for reasonable people, and lending out other people's property without permission isn't reasonable. \n\"What am I going to say to my friend when I have to tell her that my child is being selfish and wants her book back before her kid is done reading it?\" \n\"I'm sorry, but I loaned this to your daughter without checking with my kid first. My kid hasn't read it yet.

So going forward if anyone in our lives expresses and interest in something that belongs to you or Dad, I'm going to let them borrow it for as long as they like.  Like you've taught me, I'm not going to seek your permission as you've shown it isn't necessary.  If you find something missing in the days and weeks ahead, feel free to ask me and I'll happily tell you if I've lent it out.

It was $120 and I saved it up from my part time job working $7.25 an hour. \n\nShe had some poor relatives visit and she felt so bad for the kids. She just HAD  to GIVE them my NEW ps2. I hadn't even played it yet.", "I would ask your parents if they would be mad if you lent out something of theirs that they had been waiting for a long time and they had not even had the chance to enjoy it yet. Maybe post something on Facebook about how they did this to you and also list the families name so maybe they will see it and get it back for you. I hope you get it back with out any damage.", "NTA. Your mom has no business loaning out your books without your permission in the first place, and her prioritizing her friend\u2019s daughter\u2019s ability to read the book over her own makes no sense to me.", "The massive amount of PO I would be if my parents did this to teenage me.\n\nHonestly OP? Keep being petty.\n\nGo one step further and loan things of your parents out to random adults.\n\nNTA.", "Oooh, this makes me so angry for you OP. It boils my blood just thinking about someone lending out one of my books without permission, let alone one I *hadn't finished reading*. You are NTA. Young as you are, realistically there isn't a good way to stop your mom taking your books now, but just know that when you get older you will be able to have your own library with a door that locks so no one else will take your books. (Speaking from experience here. One of the best parts of moving out for me was having my own place for my books that only I could touch/organize)", "NTA. Yet another bookworm checking in to reassure you that no, you are not the asshole. You have been waiting for this book, you just got it, and they just lent it out without even caring that you haven't even finished it? No, this is not acceptable. You probably take good care of your books too since you love to read. Who knows what condition it will come back in? \n\nI am also a parent (my son is an adult now) and I never once lent out one of his books or any of his things. Yeah, I probably paid for it, BUT, I bought it for him and it's NOT MINE.\n\nJust because you're a young teen doesn't mean that you don't get to have your own things, whether or not your parents paid for them. I don't know who paid for the book. It doesn't matter if they paid for the book. The point is that it is YOUR BOOK.", "I commented already, but, do you have an Amazon account/the kindle app on your phone? I'd be happy to buy the ebook for you to let you keep reading until your real copy is returned to you.", "Oh no, YTA. But so is your mother for lending your book out. This situation is ESH.", "Lots of cussing, sorry!\n\n  I recently bought the first book in the witcher series to put in my (admittedly large) TBR pile. I am so excited to read it, but various mental issue things means I can't put it next, I have to follow the order of the book pile. If someone decided to grab my copy and didn't have a due date though? I'd be flipping my lid. I wouldn't be able to concentrate on what I'm reading currently. I'd be going \"what if they dog ear it, what if they sneeze in it, what if they use something awful as a bookmark, etc\" \n\n  To be fair, I do have rules for how my personal books are to be treated, but a lot of people don't treat books like they belong to someone else! I've gotten books back where the person I lent it to \"helpfully\" wrote annotations and WROTE IN MY FUCKING BOOK, in fucking ink!. Now, I'm not a monster, I like annotations if I'm buying a copy  where they're already there. It's like a little bonus in my eyes. But to get a book back from where I loaned it to a friend and they wrote in it? The audacity. \n\n  I didn't mean to make this longer, but typing all this unlocked a memory where I loaned a (paperback) book to an acquaintance, and she ripped the fucking front and back covers off because \"it was easier to hold in one hand that way\". I saw red. She offered to pay for a new copy, but I figured her English degree from a very sports centered college was already revenge enough.", "Jumping on here to say that your mom should call Lila's mom to say that you expect the book back in 7 days. Even if she's not finished and it better be in brand new condition. \n\nYour mom really crossed a lot of boundaries by loaning your book w/o your permission, \\*especially\\* since you haven't read it yet. Some books just aren't loanable--they belong on your keeper shelf and no one gets to read it but you. \n\nTrust me--be very careful when loaning out your books. My  BFF borrowed 2 hardbacks for her college son to read, and I never got either one of them back. I was at her house and saw that one of her dogs had had a go at them. She never mentioned them again.\n\nSome people actually keep 2 copies of their favorites--1 to keep and cherish, and 1 to loan out.\n\nI hope you enjoy this one (when you get it back) as much as you anticipate you will.", "Happy cake day!!", "Keep doing it, \nDouble down \u2018why don\u2019t you ask your daughter Lila to do it?\u2019 \u2018Well, looks like she\u2019s your daughter, since you care more about her than me\u2019\nEven after you get 5e book back, keep doing until they apologize.\n\nCall out their bad parenting.", "I was absolutely this dramatic with one of my books.\n\nA friend wanted to read it, and I told her she could borrow it - if she agreed to buy me a new one if she damamged it (I'd seen the state of her books, and was being cautious).\n\nWhen I got it back, sure enough, it was damamged. I spent weeks hounding her for a replacement or repayment 9at boarding school, so she couldn't escape me), and she complained to her Mom... who immediately told her to replace the damn book.\n\nNot sure if Mom made her buy it or bought it herself, but I got a replacement - and our friendship was saved. (I'm not sure it would have survived Book-gate.)", "Or hey mum, I lent your credit card to a homeless guy on the street. He promised he'd return it when he is finished with it.

Look up her contacts online.", "Fair enough. If you change your mind, you can dm me & let me know, or comment back. I will send you a digital gift card. But good on you for being responsible.

You're 14, so I know you had to do some extra chores, babysitting, something to come up with the money. In my original response to your post, I said you were NTA and even if they had paid for it, it was still YOUR BOOK. Now that I know you had to earn the money yourself and you're too young to work at any job, this makes it so much worse. I am so sorry this happened to you.", "that's what I thought", "NTA but please don't post what book/series it is. There's a decent chance some actual A/H will message you with spoilers.", "Good choice.  Sometime try Brandon Sanderson's books.

It blows my mind because I would never not return a book.", "100%", "Mysteries, fantasy, romance,", "The validation helps honestly, this was like 4 years ago, and I'm still salty. I can't tell you how many people are like \"it's just paper, she offered to replace it, whats the big deal\" like no! Loaned out (willingly or not), books are part of your soul if you're a bookwyrm.

My floating bookshelves are art and therefore are hands off.", "That bookshelf sounds awesome I'd love to see it", "Well to boil all of those into one, I would recommend Kate Atkinson, she does those well. She's a bit literary and enjoys (and excels at) a good turn of phrase.  Her mysteries can be a bit predictable, but that's not a true flaw imo, because her reveals are well written as well.\n\nI don't much enjoy romance myself, so my recs reflect that. Fiona Davis might be an author you could enjoy, low on fantasy though. Alice Feeney (mystery and suspense), Kylie Lee Baker (fantasy,  mystery, strong protags). To go towards YA, anything by David Clement-Davies is pretty good for low stakes mystery, with fantasy thrown in. \n\n  And I haven't read it yet, obviously, but I'm hoping I'll be able to recommend the witcher series after I finally am able to start on it. From the shows, it seems like it would fulfill all three at once lol!\n  \nI'm trying to stay basic here though lol.

You're probably right.", "I am sorry. I have never run across parents limiting the number of books their child can read. Some schools have reading programs where students are encouraged to read a book from the class/school library, take tests to confirm knowledge and then earn points toward the grade. The more books/pages (with passing test scores) that are read, the better the grade would be. \n\nDo you have anything like that at your school? I know it doesn't resolve the issues with the brand new book, but maybe would give you a chance to be able to read more books overall since it'd technically be homework?"]}
