My kid was an avid reader, no way would I take a book she bought (& she bought a lot of her own.

I was afraid they wouldn't give it back until they were done. \n\nI found something I was interested in on Etsy and thought you might like it too. You can get a stamp with your name, \"From the library of X\", with ink or to emboss the page. While your mother would have to open your book to see it, it's a fairly good way to mark something as unequivocally yours. Sometimes seeing someone else's name on something is a good reminder that it's not your property. \n\nI wouldn't do any of the revenge loaning out things that people are suggesting. Your mother hasn't yet realized that you have your own possessions and that she doesn't own them. If you start loaning out her stuff she may take everything of yours away. It won't teach her the lesson that needs to be taught. \n\nDo keep asking for the book back though. \"I would like to have my property, that I bought and paid for, returned to me.\" Nothing else. Reasons are for reasonable people, and lending out other people's property without permission isn't reasonable. \n\"What am I going to say to my friend when I have to tell her that my child is being selfish and wants her book back before her kid is done reading it?\" \n\"I'm sorry, but I loaned this to your daughter without checking with my kid first.

So going forward if anyone in our lives expresses and interest in something that belongs to you or Dad, I'm going to let them borrow it for as long as they like.  Like you've taught me, I'm not going to seek your permission as you've shown it isn't necessary.  If you find something missing in the days and weeks ahead, feel free to ask me and I'll happily tell you if I've lent it out.

So she feels she has the right to give your belongings away without asking you. Your feelings don't matter to her because she's all about herself. I wonder how many other ways she has violated your autonomy? It may seem just like a story about a book but my parents would never dream of doing anything like this to me and I wouldn't do this to my kid either.", "NTA \n\nYour mom is the asshole she lent out a book of yours that she didn\u2019t even buy it would be wrong but if she did she would\u2019ve at least had the I bought it so it\u2019s technically mine excuse on her side but she didn\u2019t which makes it worse.", "Explain to them that what they did was disrespectful to you. It was your property to do with. \n\nYou bought that book with the intention of reading it. As a book reader there are experiences, smells, sounds and textures you always associate with reading.  Your mom deprived you of this experience.\n\nIf they tell you it's just a book, tell them that thay are devaluing you just because you are a minor.", "You are NTA buuut\u2026 the best way to teach empathy is to have the other person be in the same position. So lend your mother\u2019s Tupperware to a friend and let your Mum know that she will get it back when your friend is good and ready to give it back. Don\u2019t raise the issue with her again.", "Question did you buy the book with your own money not that it matters who bought it it's your book, people cant just lend out others book like it's there own personal library.", "NTA, who does that. Your mom is awful!", "If your mom wants Lila to read the book YOU paid for so bad, she can buy her a copy. NTA OP.", "NTA\n\nI'm also a bookworm and this is unacceptable. What was stopping the 12 year olds mother from getting her this book as well, if the kid is into the series also? \n\nAnother angle is, it's quite dangerous what these parents are teaching this young girl as acceptable behaviour, mom took something of hers without asking and she's expected to be just okay with it.", "NTA it is YOUR book. They purchased it for YOU once it is yours they can\u2019t exactly loan it out without YOUR permission. What your mother did was really shitty.", "NTA. Don't apologize", "i checked (i use libby all the time) and there is a line of 100+ people on this book\n\nedit: a word", "it was on my desk so not hidden or anything...i guess my mom went in my room and grabbed it?", "yeah thats the book\n\nshannon messenger left book 8.5 on a horrible cliffhanger, i just need to know lol", ">Honestly, it would be scorched earth, but this is tantamount to one of your friends liking something precious to your Mom like her favorite ear rings and you \"loaning\" them to your friend. Whats the big deal? She'll get them back in a few days. THey might be damaged, but she'll get them back most likely. \n\nIf we live in a world without rules, decorum, or basic decency, we will both live in this world. Every. Single. Phone. Charger. Will. Be. Hidden.\n\nIf we burn down this world, we will all burn together. Anything mom cared for would mysteriously disappear. \"What do you mean such an be such is missing? Are you sure you didn't lend it to anyone? How sad for you!\"\n\nDramatic? Yes, but there's a reason I read. To keep everyone safe from me. \n\nI'm a mom with teens. They know I'm creative AF with the natural consequences and interesting inconveniences. \n\n\"Yep, my mom got concerned I went to an after school club and didn't text about being late and needing a ride. As punishment, my mom left me 3 long voicemails with background music.\"", "I was about to ask the same.", "Not even a book worm and I\u2019d be pissed if someone gave something I was reading away when I was only 70 pages in. That\u2019s super rude of her! NTA. \n\nBut the commenter above me has the best advice. Once you calm down, explain to your mom why it made you feel the way it did and try to set some respectful/mature/adult boundaries with her and your possessions. If all else fails, show her this thread lol. Good luck op! Hope you get your book back in a timely fashion <3 Honestly Lila should return it immediately, but I guess that might be wishful thinking in this situation.", "I used to have a mini library. Categorized, organized. I had a complete and accurate booklist with the shelf location noted, since I had them pretty much quadruple filled lol. An old roommate of mine was home full time because of a disability, and she would go in and take them without permission constantly. And while she read them she would dog eat pages, with this weird zigzag fold over job, with sharp creases she basically ironed in. You could see where she'd pressed something in to get it crisp. But that wasn't the worst part. While she was reading, she would fold the book in half the wrong way. Not curling a few pages back, curling the cover. No, she would crack the spine so it folding the wrong way. And do it again whenever it started to curl more than she wanted. At best you'd get a book back looking like it had been rolled up in someone's pocket. At worst it would come back in pieces. It was heartbreaking. I would rather she had lost it than see it come back like that. Ultimately, I switched to e-books. I miss the feel of paper, but people don't question you saying no about loaning an expensive electronic as much as they do about a book.", "I lent my brand new copy of the order of the phoenix to my best friend when it first came out, she and her mum read it and it came back with the hardback cover hanging off, no apology or anything, I don't think anyone in my family lent them anything again", "I LOVE Holmes, and Watson too \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f  Are you a believer in the Great Game?", "JB is *the* Holmes\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "dont have her contact info, mom does but doesnt want me to contact her. i dont see her at church or school, and she lives like 45 minutes away driving.", "i bought it myself, with money from raking the neighbor's yard", "OP, I'm so sorry. You need to prepare yourself for your book being damaged when it comes back. It's a 700+ pages book, they need a different kind of care to read without becoming dog eared and marked, and a 12yo probably won't even know how to handle it.\n\nTry having a calm conversion with your parents about this, ask them what they will do if your book is damaged before you even read it. Try getting them to understand how they let you down. I'm sorry.", "Your mother is prioritizing looking generous to her friends over being a caring or respectful parent to her own daughter, which is really a shame. Moments like this can really erode a parent/child relationship in ways that carry over well into adulthood.", "OP You have some ways of fighting back here. \n\n1: Show your mom this post and all the comments saying what an asshole she is and how in the wrong she is. \n\n2: Start lending out or hiding her items (nothing too valuable) but anything that would be really annoying to be without, Chargers, reading glasses, TV remote, the book she's reading etc... \n\n3: Stop talking or interacting with her entirely. If she confronts you about it just say \"My mommy told me not to talk to criminals. You took the book ***I paid for*** without permission and gave it away. That makes you a thief and someone I don't want to talk to\" \n\n4: Hunt down Lucy and Lila online, see if Mom is friends with them on Facebook and start pestering them and their family members."]}
