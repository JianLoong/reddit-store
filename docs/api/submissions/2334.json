My kid was an avid reader, no way would I take a book she bought (& she bought a lot of her own.

I was afraid they wouldn't give it back until they were done. \n\nI found something I was interested in on Etsy and thought you might like it too. You can get a stamp with your name, \"From the library of X\", with ink or to emboss the page. While your mother would have to open your book to see it, it's a fairly good way to mark something as unequivocally yours. Sometimes seeing someone else's name on something is a good reminder that it's not your property. \n\nI wouldn't do any of the revenge loaning out things that people are suggesting. Your mother hasn't yet realized that you have your own possessions and that she doesn't own them. If you start loaning out her stuff she may take everything of yours away. It won't teach her the lesson that needs to be taught. \n\nDo keep asking for the book back though. \"I would like to have my property, that I bought and paid for, returned to me.\" Nothing else. Reasons are for reasonable people, and lending out other people's property without permission isn't reasonable. \n\"What am I going to say to my friend when I have to tell her that my child is being selfish and wants her book back before her kid is done reading it?\" \n\"I'm sorry, but I loaned this to your daughter without checking with my kid first. My kid hasn't read it yet.
