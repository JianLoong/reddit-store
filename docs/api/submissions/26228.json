{"id": 26228, "submission_id": "16ae0po", "title": "AITA for refusing to provide veterinary care to a client after several difficult interactions", "selftext": "I own a small veterinary clinic. We are in a rural area and the next closest vet who will provide the services I can offer is about 1-1.5 hours away.\n\nSo a client called asking to book an appointment. She was referred by a person that I have done work for in the past when I was at another clinic, and have never had a problem with. During the visit I performed an exam and took X-rays during the visit. The total bill for the visit was around $150. It should be noted that during the 45 minute long appointment the client never made any indication that she was unable to pay for the visit that day, and told the receptionist at check out that she had forgotten her purse and would come back on Friday to pay. We told her that we require payment at the time of service, but she left anyways. That night around 10pm, she called the after hours phone toask a couple of questions. I answered her questions and then asked if she could come in the next morning to pay her bill. She said that it wouldn\u2019t be very convenient for her. I told her \u201cIt won\u2019t be very convenient for me to not be able to pay my staff Friday\u201d She didn\u2019t like that very much and ended the call after saying she would come in first thing in the morning.\n\nInstead of first thing she came in at 4pm and paid with cash. She was rude to the receptionist and said things like \u201cTell the Dr here\u2019s his money so he can eat tonight\u201d, and \u201cmake sure you count it all so you\u2019re not calling and asking for it again\u201d. That Friday the dog was scheduled for a surgery in which the total bill would be around $700. The surgery was a complete success and went very well. The client was very upset that she couldn\u2019t be in the room during surgery, but in the end left with the dog and seemed happy.\n\n3 days after the surgery, I received a call from the friend. Apparently the dog had some post op complications that were completely preventable if the client had followed the instructions on the discharge sheet we sent. The friend told me that the client said I didn\u2019t do a good job, was incompetent and that she had posted negative comments about me and the clinic on Facebook. I told the friend that all standards of care were followed.\n\nI told the staff to blacklist the client and her friend. About 3 days after this call the client called back to apologize, and said she was completely in the wrong, that I did a good job and she just \u201cHad a lot going on in her personal life\u201d at the time. I told her that I accepted her apology. She then asked if she could make an appointment for her other dog. I said \u201cNo, we won\u2019t be doing service for you anymore\u201d and she hung up.\n\nTLDR: Client walked out without paying, and was a pain in the ass.

I would have blacklisted her before you did.  You took a risk by doing the $700 surgery after you had so much trouble getting her to pay the first bill.\n\nShe tried to hurt your business by leaving negative reviews.  She was rude and difficult about paying you.  You're doing the smart thing by refusing to deal with her.\n\nI read an article in the New York Times a few days ago about the difficulties small businesses have in getting paid.  Larger companies and wealthy clients delay payment via invoicing and people who don't want to pay or have other demands (like your client) leave negative reviews.  It was completely fair of you to have let the client know that you need to be paid so you can pay your staff.  That's how the world works.  You should be focusing on being a vet, not on wasting your time on dealing with difficult people.", "NTA This person purposely damaged your business\u2019s image.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019m surprised that you got her to pay and I have a feeling that if the relationship has gone on longer, she would have eventually not paid at all.", "NTA Clients who post untrue stuff online to damage your business are a liability and shouldn\u2019t be helped. On top of that her behaviors & payment issues means she will continue to be a headache. Let\u2019s hope she learns her lesson, but you don\u2019t owe her a second chance or help from your business.", "NTA. It's your business; you have to protect it, or you won't be able to help a lot of *other* animals, right?\n\nBeing late paying a bill is one thing. But being rude and trying to burn your business down by calling you incompetent on Facebook when you weren't, one wonders why they'd want to come back anyway, if you were so incompetent?\n\nRefusing the PITA client, no question. But refusing the one who referred them? I was a little confused by some of your conflated friend/client references in the OP, so maybe I missed something, but I'm not sure what the referring client did, other than simply being guilty by association?", "Info - why block list the friend? It seems like they wanted to follow up on their referral to see what went wrong between you two and give you a heads up about the badmouthing. Am I missing something here?", "NTA You were right to blacklist the client after her obnoxious behavior. However I don\u2019t understand why you blacklisted the friend since it sounds like all she did was tell you what the client had said, which arguably was her wanting to understand what happened, maybe to see if there was an issue she should know about her bringing her pets to you. \n\nAlso who wants to be in the room when their dog was having surgery? Not only would that be potentially dangerous and unhygienic, but I\u2019d think anyone who wasn\u2019t a vet would find it quite disturbing to see their beloved pet being operated on!", "NTA\n\nSounds like she can enjoy an long car ride to her vet from now on. Play stupid games...", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019d expect a free vet bill. My dog tore her ACL. I took her to the emergency vet, and told them I only had $300. They did what they could and said she tore her ACL. I called another clinic and asked about ACL repair surgery. They gave me a quote of $3,400 USD. I am paying for the surgery now, but scheduled it for October 2. Animals cost money. She should know a vet bill isn\u2019t going to be cheap, especially for surgeries. Then, she neglected the proper care for the animal. \n\nYou have every right to blacklist both parties.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The entitled client needs to learn her place, but you're punishing her friend for asking a couple of questions, too? Do you just want to run your business into the ground?", "You know, it *is* possible she actually did forget her purse. What did you expect her to do when you and your staff said she wasn't allowed to leave without paying? Sit there until cash fell out of her butt? That part of the story gave me pause. If someone cant pay you send them a bill and escalate to collections if necessary, not insist someone stay and try to demand they magically make money appear out of nowhere. And pretending you wouldn't be able to pay your staff without her modest bill was dishonest.\n\nIf she did forger her purse, which you've provided no evidence that she was lying, then it's entirely understandable why she'd be salty from then on.", "Nta at all.
