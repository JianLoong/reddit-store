Theaters who buy rights must agree to not make ANY changes without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.", ">This is one option, sure.  It all depends on if you want to put forth the time and effort to overhaul the script.\n\nGood luck with that. Copyright and rights purchase contracts are very restrictive.", "No, no, no -- OP cannot change \"whatever they want.\" Buying the rights to a show means you must do THAT SHOW, and most contracts EXPLICITLY say you can't change any of the language without explicit permission from the copyright holders. You CERTAINLY can't just add your own stuff in.", "this is a terrible take.  OP always has the right of refusal, and if they are doing it on the principles of equity, they should not be forced to direct a play that contradicts that.  If the theater company got the rights to do a stage version of showgirls and you find out your directing grade school kids, I sure as hell hope youre noping the whole way home.", "That's what I'm asking - would they give that permission? Probably only the OP can answer that (and maybe not immediately).", "OP's right of refusal was never questioned. No one is being forced to do anything.", "No you cannot, coming from 10+ years as a stage manager. You need specific permission from the author or copywriter holder to make any changes. I once did a radio theatre version of a show, we needed to add dialogue to give exposition and the author himself came to our theatre to write the lines.", "Oh, apologies -- I misread your comment. In my experience with volunteer theater, permission to change content is very rarely given. I can think of once in over 20 years where the theater I usually work when we got it and it was a change that a lot of professional theaters already did so there was precedent.", ">Feeling uncomfortable is not a reasonable grounds for abandoning your commitment.\n\nA volunteer can absolutely decline to \\*volunteer\\* if it makes them feel uncomfortable and still not be the asshole.  Being outside your comfort zone by working with racist/sexist/bigoted material is not the same as trying a new sport.", "N T A. And I get it's 'just community theatre' but really, you are *super not supposed* to change a single word of a script, so this just would have been an immediate 'no' for me without a different script.\n\nAnd this doesn't matter so much because I am presuming this isn't paid contract work, but you really should require approval of a script before agreeing to direct anything.\n\nEDIT: INFO: Wait, did they tell you what show before they purchased rights? Because you should have researched ahead of time something as easily accessible as South Pacific (what people are speculating in the comments). If you didn't research and they bought it anyway while fully under the impression they had a director that was cool with the show, this is pretty bad on your part. What business do you have casting a show you only read days before, kids in community theatre or not?", "NTA.  Show rights can indeed be very expensive.  However \\*you\\* are a 21 year old volunteer.  While this isn't a comment on your skills or potential value as a director, it does likely mean that you're not that difficult, time-consuming, or costly to replace.  They asked, informally, a week and a half ago and you accepted, equally informally.  Upon getting further information about the content, you declined.  They've lost a week of time in hiring their director, which is a bummer for them but since they sound pretty dang flaky I have to imagine isn't their first go-round with this sort of thing.  The show will go on.", "NTA, it sounds like they should have ran the play by the person directing it before buying the rights for it. Either way, you\u2019re not the ah for backing out.", "INFO, why did you agree to direct a show you were not familiar with? IMO you should have read the script before agreeing, or if that was absolutely impossible, at least have a full understanding of the show.", "Soft YTA, you should have researched the show before accepting and as someone with theatre experience (as I assume you have since you were asked to direct) should be aware that requesting to license a different show with only a week's notice is no simple or reasonable ask. That being said, if the theatre company is not willing to let you work around the things in the show you are not comfortable with then yes, you are absolutely within your rights to walk away from the project. It sounds like you got very excited and accepted without fully understanding how much work is involved outside of the performance aspect of producing a show. Use this as a learning experience and perhaps ask to shadow another director you know and trust or request to be an Assistant Director somewhere if possible. Good luck!", "YTA. And weak.", "NTA", "NTA, but lesson learned here - don't agree to direct a play without ALSO getting approval authority for the play.\n\nGiven the content you've described, you are absolutely NTA for not wanting anything to do with it.", "That was my first thought. Many times you *can\u2019t* modify it. \n\nNTA. I wouldn\u2019t want to be part of what is described in the OP\u2019s post either.", "\u201cSouth Pacific\u201d! The musical that teaches us racism is wrong because one lady talks herself into marrying a rich Frenchman despite his mixed children, and another guy convinces himself he\u2019s in love with an underage prostitute pimped out by her caricatured mom, but doesn\u2019t have to go through with anything like marrying g her and bringing her back to Akron, because he conveniently dies!", "I\u2019m really dying to know what the show is. I assumed it was \u201cThe King and I\u201d because it\u2019s got so many kids but I can\u2019t remember any sexual innuendos. Other than the, you know, harem.", "Is South Pacific racist? I haven't seen it since I was young, so I'm sure a LOT of the content went over my head. From what I understand, it was written with the intent to be anti-racist. There is a song about how racism is taught, not inherent, which was controversial at the time for justifying interracial relationships.", "The chances of OP being caught doing that is slim, but you can be fined pretty heavily for changing stuff from a licensed script.", "There's a difference between not wanting to direct a play because you just don't like it and not wanting to do it because the content isn't appropriate for the age group. OP should have researched it, but the theatre should have too. ESH, but mainly the theatre for not doing their due diligence.", "Annie get your gun is also another show that aged like milk", "I'm pretty sure there's a licensed \"Jr.\" version of *South Pacific*, but *King and I* is another good guess.", "South Pacific is a show that was considered very progressive when it was first staged\u2026 70 years ago. Yes, the intent was NOT racism at the time but that doesn\u2019t mean that the way they chose to depict it wasn\u2019t still deeply problematic. It was written by white people who thought racism was bad but also didn\u2019t have enough input from the actual people they were representing to not write them as stereotypes.", "Does it have to be willful / intentional or can an actor freezing up or switching a line accidently get his theater sued? Does he have any liability personally or just the theater company who signed the license? Do theater companies get insurance to pay these damages in case an actor is caught improvising?", "OP doesn't name the play, so the only indicator that the theatre didn't do it's due diligence is the word of someone that now wants to step down because she didn't do her due diligence.", "Schools in the south do this all the time in my experience, though. I have been in tons of plays with \"problematic\"elements changed or adjusted. Unless someone in the play complains to the copyright holder, they aren't likely to even know. That said, a lot of shit that is common isn't actually legal. I mean, my school used photocopies of music for all of our choirs and that was illegal as hell.", "I was actually IN that one in 2006. We cut the \"I'm An Indian, Too\" song (without asking permission, which is bad) but we did, I am terribly embarrassed to say, have white actors whooping and hollering in \"war paint.\" We should have known better, and I would NEVER recommend that show in its current form to be performed.", "Yeah, it's definitely one of those things that needs to be considered in context - iirc it was considered so progressive that it was actually banned in parts of the American south when it was first staged, but today we can very clearly see the problems with it. I don't know if there is a way to contextualize something like this for 8 year olds, but either way the fact that the group is acting pissy about it already doesn't inspire confidence that they would if they could", "What are the legal implications of an actor freezing up and improving a replacement line? Is there leeway for that kind of thing at all or is it actually something they can sue over?", "Sheeiiiiit I was in Annie Get Your Gun in 1995 and we were embarrassed about it then too!", "Yes - a little word swapping or ad libbing is usually fine. It\u2019s the pre planned changing of stuff that\u2019s a problem. Though I don\u2019t think a production could be like \u201coh noooo we accidentally skipped that racist song every performance because we forgot.\u201d", "Yeah, I cannot believe that the theater - myself included, and I was a grown-ass woman at the time - went \u201cwe should cut this song because it\u2019s racist\u201d but somehow didn\u2019t make the jump to \u201calso we\u2019re literally painting this guy red and maybe we shouldn\u2019t do that.\u201d"]}
