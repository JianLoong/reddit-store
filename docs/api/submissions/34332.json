Theaters who buy rights must agree to not make ANY changes without the explicit permission of the copyright holder.", ">This is one option, sure.  It all depends on if you want to put forth the time and effort to overhaul the script.\n\nGood luck with that. Copyright and rights purchase contracts are very restrictive.", "No, no, no -- OP cannot change \"whatever they want.\" Buying the rights to a show means you must do THAT SHOW, and most contracts EXPLICITLY say you can't change any of the language without explicit permission from the copyright holders. You CERTAINLY can't just add your own stuff in.", "this is a terrible take.  OP always has the right of refusal, and if they are doing it on the principles of equity, they should not be forced to direct a play that contradicts that.  If the theater company got the rights to do a stage version of showgirls and you find out your directing grade school kids, I sure as hell hope youre noping the whole way home.", "That's what I'm asking - would they give that permission? Probably only the OP can answer that (and maybe not immediately).", "OP's right of refusal was never questioned. No one is being forced to do anything.", "No you cannot, coming from 10+ years as a stage manager. You need specific permission from the author or copywriter holder to make any changes. I once did a radio theatre version of a show, we needed to add dialogue to give exposition and the author himself came to our theatre to write the lines.", "Oh, apologies -- I misread your comment. In my experience with volunteer theater, permission to change content is very rarely given. I can think of once in over 20 years where the theater I usually work where we got it and it was a change that a lot of professional theaters already did so there was precedent.", ">Feeling uncomfortable is not a reasonable grounds for abandoning your commitment.\n\nA volunteer can absolutely decline to \\*volunteer\\* if it makes them feel uncomfortable and still not be the asshole.
