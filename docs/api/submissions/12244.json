I was super excited when I found out that we were going to be having a little girl, and the first thing that I did was talk to my fianc\u00e9 about baby names. My fianc\u00e9 wanted to name her Lilly because those were his late mother\u2019s favorite flowers. After some discussion between us he agreed to the name Lilith (we are using Lilly as a nickname) because while I liked the name Lilly it just didn\u2019t seem like the right name for our daughter. My fianc\u00e9 likes that Lilith sounds like Lilly and that Lilly can be used as a nickname for her.\nWhen I told my parents about the name we chose for the baby, they had quite a few choice words for me. For a bit of background, my parents are religious (not to the extreme but enough that it dictates a lot of things for them) and they are kind of traditional. My dad hated the name, saying that I was naming our daughter after a demon. I told him why I was naming her Lilith and he asked why I couldn\u2019t just name her Lilly since we were using it as a nickname anyways. I refused and just ended the conversation because I knew I wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere with him. \nI went a few weeks without bringing up the name again to my parents because I knew the conversation would just go the same way if I brought it up again. About 2 weeks went by and I officially made our gender reveal post on Facebook for our friends and family to see which included the name we chose. In those 2 weeks we also decided on her middle name. We decided on Marie because my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother\u2019s name was Maria and I have an extremely close friend with the middle name Marie. \nNot even an hour later I got a phone call from my dad and he was livid. My dad had seen the post I made on Facebook and it wasn\u2019t even the first name he was mad about anymore. It was her middle name. For context, my mom adopted me and isn\u2019t my biological mother. My dad said that my biological mother\u2019s middle name was Marie and he couldn\u2019t stand being reminded of her. I never even knew her middle name, only her first name, so that was new to me. I told him again why we chose that name, and I even mentioned my best friend (he knows I\u2019ve been friends with her since I was a little kid) saying that her middle name was also Marie. I told him to get over it because that was the name we chose and if he didn\u2019t like it then that was his problem. \nIt\u2019s been about a month since the argument with me and my dad about the name, and with the baby almost here (I\u2019m due in June) I feel like the name is still perfect, but my dad still resents it, though he\u2019s not making huge arguments anymore (mainly side comments about the name). He did the same thing for my son\u2019s name because he wanted me to name him Anakin (from Star Wars) and I said no. \nSo AITA for what I am going to name my daughter?", "created_utc": 1678762530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11quml8/aita_for_the_name_i_chose_for_my_baby/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anyone else can kick rocks.", "NTA. Lilith Marie is a perfectly good name. Hopefully, your dad can build a new and more positive association with the names you've chosen after she's born.

Apparently God made the only 2 people and then decided this equality thing didn't suit the future patriarchal society and needed a a do-over and created Eve from Adam's rib instead of how Lilith was made from dirt like Adam. When you only make 2 and one doesn't work for you, that's a 50% failure rate.\n\nif you really want to annoy your Dad, you can suggest that if Lilith was Adam's first wife, and then Adam ran off with Eve when she was created, does that make Eve Adam's mistress? It's not like there was someone else around to help them divorce and marry after all.", "It\u2019s your right to name your kids.
