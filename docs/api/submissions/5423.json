I love her. She is the first person that i have truly been happy with. I also have a motorcycle. She hates it. She says that it is dangerous, which it is. She was asking me to sell it for awhile,but i never will. That bike was my dad's. He loved it. When he died he wanted me to have it. Because he knew that if it went to anyone else they would sell it. That bike is priceless to me. I explicitly told my girlfriend that i will never get rid of it. She said that she understood. But then i get home my bike is outside and has a huge for sale sign on it. I immediately confront her. She said that she was doing it because she loved me and didn't want me to die on it. I told her that she can get the fuck out of my house. I was so pissed. She keeps texting me saying that i overreacted and that it wasn't a big deal. She tried to sell my property without my knowledge. She knew how much that bike means to me and she still did it.

I wonder how she would feel if you tried selling all her stuff? If indeed you love her you might want to have a heart-to-heart conversation with her to see if the relationship can be saved. Trust can be restored though it takes a lot of effort; ask yourself if you think it's worth it.", "NTA.\n\nIt is both your property and personal memento of your dad. Completely out of line and invasion of your privacy.", "NTA. Your girlfriend needs to learn to respect your autonomy and have an adult conversation rather than going behind your back if she is concerned for your welfare.", "NTA /", "NTA OP! I\u2019m so sorry. If she didn\u2019t know about the sentimentality I\u2019d MAYBE see her point of view but It would still be unforgivable. The fact she knew means the didn\u2019t give a fuck that it was your dads, didn\u2019t give a fuck that it went to you because he didn\u2019t want it sold, didn\u2019t give a fuck that it\u2019s probably one of the few things you have of his, and didn\u2019t give a fuck that it was not her place. She thinks she knows better than you, and that her feelings matter more than yours, and than your connection to you late father. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s not someone I would ever trust around me, in my home, and around that bike again. Fact is if you took her back you\u2019d always have to be somewhat paranoid about the bike and keeping it hidden/safe and that\u2019s not something you should ever have to worry about with your life partner. She took advantage of your trust. Honestly I get the feeling she was trying to make a quick buck too but even if she wasn\u2019t everything else I said I 1000% stand behind. You deserve better OP I know it sucks. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking about whatever good in your relationship and wether you could get over it because she claimed to have \u201cgood intentions\u201d . The fact is you\u2019d have to live in a permanent state of paranoia over it and other sentimental things she may not like in the future. That\u2019s not normal, not to mention the fact she puts her feelings above yours means you\u2019re in for a lot more issues aside from your material things/assets. You really gotta let this one go, keep her in your life if you want to stay friends but you should really break up. Your issues are only going to get worse, even if she apologizes until she\u2019s blue in the face and claims she\u2019s learned. Those underlying impulses that made her think she knew better will not just disappear. Wishing you the best. You\u2019ll find someone that loves and respects you equally one day, love is one thing but love doesn\u2019t mean shit without respect! And she does NOT respect you OP!\n\nETA the fact she said you overreacted & that it wasn\u2019t a big deal: means she still doesn\u2019t see just how fucked up her actions were or that she really did anything wrong at all. THAT alone tells you how she really feels, and that she\u2019d be capable of doing something similar again in the future. Regardless of whatever apologetic crap she pulls out of her ass from now on. Let your head take the lead.\n\nETA2 I didn\u2019t even realize you said she understood when you said you\u2019d never sell it. SO apart from everything else I said, she\u2019s a liar and probably had the intent to do this when she told you that. Likely so you\u2019d believe whatever story she came up with.", "INFO: How did she get it out front? Do you not live together? Why was she selling it at your house", "NTA. If she had sold the bike it would have been grand theft and probably forgery on the title, if she had it. \n\nOP, make sure you still have the title someplace and make sure it isn't signed.
