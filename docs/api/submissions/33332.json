You can love the cat and have boundaries. As the owner of cats, it sounds like the cat is just being a cat by hiding and living life on its own terms (hiding when it wants, coming out when it wants).", "ESH. You aren\u2019t wrong for not wanting the cat on your countertops. But the deterrent might be causing the cat harm. Tinfoil alone, minus the spray would likely be effective. On a scale of 1 to 10 though, this is like a 2, for just slight assholery. Brainstorm with your sis for a better solution.", "NTA\n\nNo problem with that, the cat isn't traumatized, it's a cat, they love hiding. It's basically the most common cat behaviour there is.", "The cat is not traumatized.  The cat shouldn't be on any counter or table at all. Keep doing the spray and foil and your sister will get over it or leave. NTAH. Btw I have always had cats and ZERO have been allowed on my counters or tables.

Those feet and butthole are too nasty for food prep areas.\n\nThere's not many options to train cats and you picked the nicest ones. Good for you the training is working.
