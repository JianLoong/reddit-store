I (F30) received my PhD a few years ago and have since been lucky enough to have a teaching position at a university that allows me to research and publish. My field is fairly specialized and niche. As a woman colour let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had my fair share of proving I deserve a seat at the table. It\u2019s half the work for us (I have no interest in debating this reality, fight with the wall). \n\nAnyways, met up with some academia friends who brought along other friends, one being a 28M currently doing his Masters in the same field. Mutual friend mentioned we\u2019re in the same field and that opened the flood gates. All night it\u2019s like I was taking an exam on the basics of my field. Then he brought up an \u201cinteresting paper\u201d he read in class the other day. I recognized it immediately, it one I co-authored with two others. He proceeded to annoyingly \u201cexplain\u201d it to me and I interrupted at one point to correct him. He tried to say I was wrong and I just don\u2019t get it blah blah blah. Eventually a friend cuts in and says, \u201cDude, it\u2019s literally her paper, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d \n\nGuy clearly becomes embarrassed and starts fumbling over words, rolls his eyes and says \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me.\u201d He didn\u2019t even look at me for the rest of the night. \n\nLater a friend texted me and said I was kind of rude to not just tell him about my credentials in the beginning or at least telling him it was my paper when it was brought up, and it was embarrassing for him to correct him. Some other friends agree. So, am I the asshole for not telling him?", "created_utc": 1670366604, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zekjvo/aita_for_not_telling_someone_i_was_the_coauthor/", "score": 708, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whether the paper was yours or not, he should know better than to mansplain things. \"You just don't get it\" speaks of entitlement and a sense of superiority. In a way, your friends' insistence that you should have told him plays into this idea. Like the problem was just that he didn't know it was your paper. It wasn't. It was that he was being a jerk. That's on him.Edit: \"You should have told him your credentials.\" No. He shouldn't need to know your credentials to not be an ah. You are NTA, but your friends are.", "NTA, OP. But I'm curious about these \"friends\" of yours who line up to defend the fragility of a mediocre, arrogant man against the mere revelation of accomplishments of a woman of color. Especially when that defense consists of literally telling you that you should have proven your credentials in order to disprove this man's assumptions about you based on how you look.\n\nI can't imagine how much casual racism and sexism you swallow all the time in your work. I don't know if you need to swallow it from people you consider friends.", "NTA. He made the assumption that due to you being both a woman and a woman of color that you have no idea what you're talking about.\n\nStand your ground, you've more than earned your spot.", "NTA.  If this came as a shock to him, either he didn\u2019t read it closely enough to be trying to explain it to anyone, or he couldn\u2019t be bothered to pay attention when you were introduced so he maybe could\u2019ve put two and two together himself.

Just presumed to be the big brain of the group. \n\nAlso if you offered your credentials, you\u2019re considered boastful but if you remain humble you\u2019re considered an a*hole? Damned if you do and damed if you don\u2019t.

It\u2019s stupid that you should have to do that.\n\nAlso guy missed out on an opportunity to learn and converse with someone at the top of the field and a coauthor of a published study.

Your friend and dude are TAs.", "HAHAHA serves him right. NTA", "NTA. If he found the paper so interesting, he could have bothered to note the authors' names. And then during introductions, check your last name. But him feeling hurt because good one-upmanship failed isn't your problem.  I'm curious how many of your friends telling you to apologize are women.", "NTA. Poor man and his fragile ego.", "NTA , Humble flex , well played .", "NTA. He walked straight into that one.", "Nta....you don't need to explain yourself to anyone....you politely tried to communicate an explanation and he shut you down...he is embarrassed because he basically got his ass handed to him in front of the writer of the interesting paper\n\nQuestion: did your friends introduce everyone by name? Because if he read it then wouldn't your name have sounded familiar to him? Or was your name not part of the article? Just asking.", "NTA. Dude deserved it. I once had a similar thing happen. They guy was going on and on about a presentation he hadn\u2019t seen but someone he knew shared the deck and started going on that I should model our program after that. It was my presentation, my process, and it was what we were doing and had been discussing the implementation for months, which he had been a part of. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA, unless he asked if you'd heard of it and you said no. But if he just assumed you hadn't heard of it or read it (much less written it) then he got what he deserved, IMO.", "Wait. He didn't recognize your name?? His mansplaining credentials are seriously questionable. Did he even read the paper? \ud83e\uddd0 I'm wishing your friend hadn't intervened now!\n\nNTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe anyone a copy of your CV to get respect. The dude was a jerk, and he proved it. Upon finding out you study the same field, he could have asked you how far along you were, or some other version of that. Instead, he assumed you were below him. You don\u2019t owe jerks a pass.", "NTA, it's funny.", "NTA - If he wasn\u2019t being a patronising AH, then it wouldn\u2019t have been an issue. And he\u2019d still have been incorrect about the meaning of the paper even if you HADN\u2019T have written it. \n\nSounds like he needed a lesson in humility.", "Um\u2026 was he not trying to correct you first? On something he was wrong about?  He embarrassed himself.  Definitely NTA. \n\nAnd I just wanted to say, even though you probably didn\u2019t just graduate, congratulations on your PHD, and published work. That\u2019s amazing!!", "NTA those stories make me laugh. Kind of like the Marshall McLuhan scene in Annie Hall.", "LMAO! NTA, he dug his hole. At best you could have smiled & said you wanted to see how 'interesting' he found your paper.", "NTA\n\nHe got what he deserved. If he hadn\u2019t been a complete tool when OP interrupted to correct him then maybe she could have said something but\u2026 eh? Sounds like she could barely get a word in edgewise.\n\nIt\u2019s a good lesson for him to learn. Adding the question  \u201cAre you familiar with it?\u201d when discussing interesting papers and before mansplaining could have saved his embarrassment. \n\nObviously he was feeling insecure and felt he had something to prove but that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. Keep letting those men embarrass themselves. I\u2019m a woman in IT, the mansplaining feels never ending some days. It warms my heart to know there are women like you out there allowing them to make fools of themselves.", "NTA. The guy was being a blustering AH trying to talk down to you about YOUR OWN FREAKING PUBLISHED ARTICLE.\n\nHe deserved every ounce of scorn and embarrassment.", "NTA\n\nLet's hope he learned from this experience. Kind of amusing that he walked himself right into that hole.", "NTA - his ego and arhcaic thought process landed him in Embarrassment Town, population...HIM.", "NTA. Dude did that to himself.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nDufus was a jerk - no need to apologize to someone who thrives on attempting to be superior to everyone.", "NTA - He embarrassed himself. It\u2019s not your job to protect his feelings. He\u2019ll be fine. Guys like him tend to fail upwards.", "NTA.\nPlease always do this, humility is healthy for personal growth\n\nIf I'd been sat there I would have been cracking out the popcorn in anticipation.", "NTA. You have a PhD and are teaching and doing research. He knew that much and that was enough. He doesn't even have a masters and was man-splaining to you. He deserves every bit of embassment he felt.", "NTA! He dug that hole he got buried. Not your fault he made ass out of himself. And there was no reason for you to have state your credentials.", "Sure,  he was rude and disrespectful to you all night because you don't have a penis,  but now that his bad behavior has resulted in mild embarrassment on his part,  you should totally be responsible for managing his feels.  Snort. \n\nOr, your friends could recognize they are perpetuating the mindset that leads to this nonsense,  and just back TF off.  All you did was stand there and be treated badly by a man who is both a boor and a bore.  NTA", "NTA\n\nSeems like more of misunderstanding than anything though, and since you don't seem particularly distress about it, I'd say if you talk to him again that its not a big deal, no hard feelings.  He'd probably really like to talk to you more and have you as someone who he can go to for advice but is too embarrassed now to ask.", "Too funny ! NTA", "NTA! I hope he's ashamed! He deserves that.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t have any obligation to divulge information about yourself. He wanted to act like a smarty pants & got embarrassed but that was 100% on him.

There would have been no need for you to lay out your credentials for him if he had bothered to listen to you. He went into that conversation with no intention of hearing anything you had to say. Your friends are not being very good friends to you right now. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.. As a black woman academic in a mainly white male field.... I get it. ... You shouldn't have to explain your creditals in order to get respect.", "NTA lol he messed around and found out", "Nta he deserved to be embarrassed", "NTA\n\nYou'll get more honest feedback if you don't immediately disclose you're the \\[co\\]author.\n\nHaving said that, are 90s flared pants better than 60-70s flared pants? Asking for a friend.", "Nta, they learned a valuable lesson about associating their foot with their mouth", "Wow, even when you're not on the job you still find it in your heart to provide teaching moments. NTA you should bill him for the free lesson.", "NTA. You corrected him nicely - this is supporting him by trying to improve his understanding. He assumed you were below him when he rejected your correction, not even to accept it as a view or perspective, but told you that you didn't get it.\n\nYou were not the person who called him out - it was a friend. It was an interaction you could have walked away from without him knowing you wrote the paper or him being embarrassed.\n\nAnyway, his embarrassment is not your problem anyway!\n\nI do wonder whether the guy has a neurodiversity or the like and just hadn't had exposure to things to challenge his biases, but if nothing else this will serve as a lesson and learning point for him.\n\nIt would be good to know that field you work in and whether there a general gender bias in that field, which may add context.", "Guessing there was no point where he said, \"have you seen the paper?\" Or maybe stopped to breathe long enough for you to interject that it was your paper. \n\nNTA", "Haha NTA it would have been socially awkward af to say \u201chi my name is OP and I have a PhD in xyz\u201d at the start.\n\nWhen this has happened to me, I try to hang back a bit and not say I\u2019m an author right away because I want people\u2019s genuine takes on what I do, even if they\u2019re negative. Once you say \u201cyeah that\u2019s mine\u201d you only get generic praise or crickets. \n\nThe only thing I will say is you know this is a student and the whole thing that makes a student a student is that they don\u2019t have that Socratic sense of knowing what they don\u2019t know. That\u2019s something doc programs really drill, but a typical masters student doesn\u2019t have that enculturation in my experience. So there\u2019s a missed opportunity in here where you could have supported his growth and maybe that\u2019s what your friends thought would happen when they brought him/ or are themselves trying to do. Instead you just shut him down, which you\u2019d have to admit isn\u2019t an intellectual justification of your argument regarding his misinterpretation. Pulling rank is punitive. Once you do it, the opportunities for teaching are limited. That could be why you\u2019re getting side eye from colleagues, because that kind of behavior can be seen as punching down, and it\u2019s shunned in some academic cultures. I think it really depends what\u2019s normal in your group. Where I\u2019m on faculty, this would definitely be seen as punching down rather than addressing a moment in a didactic or intellectual way. \n\nOn the flip side of that, you don\u2019t owe him teaching/supporting his growth if you don\u2019t want to. Ever. That\u2019s always a choice and I do get that for POC in the academy there can be issues about where your energy goes and what free labor is expected. I don\u2019t know enough to speak on that, but I recognize it is something that can play into the dynamics around these interactions. I don\u2019t see that as AH level regardless.", "This is an old ass story.", "Wasn't there and playing devils advocate.  Is it possible he wasn't \"mansplaining\" and just really excited to talk about his field outside of work/class.", "[removed]", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that he wasn\u2019t interested in your experience or knowledge or opinions, he just thought he\u2019d found a compliant audience to speak at. Only when faced with irrefutable evidence that your contributions were *at least* as valid as his did he begin to realise that his assumptions and behaviour were wrong, and then he blamed you for his mistakes.\n\nI guess that you\u2019ve already told yourself all this, but I understand how tiring it must get defending yourself against with these micro-aggressions all the time, especially if those around you don\u2019t get it or support you.", "NTA. Guy blew a great opportunity to make a connection by simply asking about your career.", "NTA.

Hopefully this dude has learned a lesson.", "NTA. If you *did* go around explaining your credentials to people off the bat, that would just make you \"bragging\" and \"pretentious\" and \"full of yourself\". There's no winning with people like him. You know that.\n\nAnd like, honestly, would it have been polite to inform him that you co-authored the paper once it got brought up? Yeah, there's a fair argument for that (even if, again, his response probably would have been to get mad at you for \"bragging\"). But by that point in the conversation, he had been tone-deaf and impolite enough to you already that you owed him no courtesy. Tell those \"friends\" of yours that you have no sympathy to spare for a man who talked over you all night; and if they care more about the embarrassment of him being corrected than the embarrassment of you being persistently disrespected, then they need to reconsider their priorities.", "NTA!

As a woman colour let\u2019s just say I\u2019ve had my fair share of proving I deserve a seat at the table. It\u2019s half the work for us (I have no interest in debating this reality, fight with the wall). \n\nAnyways, met up with some academia friends who brought along other friends, one being a 28M currently doing his Masters in the same field. Mutual friend mentioned we\u2019re in the same field and that opened the flood gates. All night it\u2019s like I was taking an exam on the basics of my field. Then he brought up an \u201cinteresting paper\u201d he read in class the other day. I recognized it immediately, it one I co-authored with two others. He proceeded to annoyingly \u201cexplain\u201d it to me and I interrupted at one point to correct him. He tried to say I was wrong and I just don\u2019t get it blah blah blah. Eventually a friend cuts in and says, \u201cDude, it\u2019s literally her paper, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying.\u201d \n\nGuy clearly becomes embarrassed and starts fumbling over words, rolls his eyes and says \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me.\u201d He didn\u2019t even look at me for the rest of the night. \n\nLater a friend texted me and said I was kind of rude to not just tell him about my credentials in the beginning or at least telling him it was my paper when it was brought up, and it was embarrassing for him to correct him. Some other friends agree. So, am I the asshole for not telling him?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "You have a PhD, and he's not even done with his master's yet. He's totally full of himself. I work in academia too and I've met grad students like him. They love to show off and act like they know more than they actually do. Do not apologize. He owes you an apology. NTA", "NTA. He is the AH to 1. Assume you aren\u2019t really in the same field by testing you, f-ing annoying and 2. Telling you you are wrong about a paper (regardless of whether you are the author or not.) It sounds like he didn\u2019t even ask you about credentials; he jumped to a conclusion about them. You clearly found out his. He suffered embarrassment due to his assumption and not listening. Mansplainers generally get upset and shift blame\u2026because they don\u2019t like to listen and only enjoy hearing themselves.", "NTA. I mean come on, you don't even really have to ask this. No ambiguity here. But damn, awesome story, so I'm glad you asked anyway. Please please please please keep doing this in the future.", "NTA - good that he\u2019s embarrassed. Maybe next time he\u2019ll learn to keep his mouth shut. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to apologize for his shitty behavior.", "NTA. He embarrassed himself, you just sat back and watched him dig his hole.", "Nta. Cherish this mansplainers worst nightmare come to life. He'll either do one of two things, either have a cone to Jesus moment & change his attitude for the better or he will stay that ignorant guy that he is. Neither of those decisions impact your life so its no great loss. He f**ked around then he found out, not your fault he was acting a fool. Don't you dare apologize for such a condescending interaction, you rock.", "NTA, doesn't sound like there was an opportunity for you to say anything lol. Tell him you'd be happy to tutor him lol", "NTA.\n\nIf he a) hadn't felt the need to mansplain and/or b) let you finish your correction where I'm guessing you were going to state you are a co-author then he wouldn't have put himself in a position to be embarrassed.", "NTA. Girl Power \ud83d\udca5\u2728\u26a1\ufe0f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd25", "NTA hopefully he learned a valuable lesson about not being a mansplaining a-hole.", "NTA because it wouldn't have even worked. One time a dude started to mansplain my book to me at a conference and when I stopped him to tell him it was my book he did. not. believe. me. Only when another man confirmed it did he believe it was true (I have a gender neutral name, but damn).", "[removed]", "NTA maybe (but doubtful) he will learn something from this and not be a mansplaining AH next time. (I know. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23)", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 NTA love it sis!", "NTA. This is hilarious. And you aren\u2019t the asshole. He was being an asshole and the friend who corrected him was kind of an asshole. You were letting him carry on and not calling him out. \n\nAs a question, is there any chance he was flirting with you or trying to hit on you? Men get even stupider than normal when that\u2019s happening.", "NTA, unless you don't laugh yourself to sleep every night thinking about it!", "NTA. He's wront and why should you have to explain your credentials rather than him just assuming he was the cleverest person in the room. Like if you went in with 'I have a PhD in bleugh, here is my CV' then you'd have been one of those annoying people that is patronising. \n\nFyi: my original comment was deleted. So have copied over and changed three words.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to help mitigate someone else\u2019s potential for embarrassment when they won\u2019t do the bare minimum to avoid embarrassing themselves. Literally all he had to do was ask what you do for a living and have the brain cells necessary to realize that having more education and job experience meant that you, ya know, had more education and job experience than he did. Instead, he decided that a woman of color would be an easy source for superiority feels.", "NTA, sounds like guy was so set on talking about himself and what he knew he didn\u2019t even allow you to the opportunity to introduce yourself and your experience properly. Maybe if he let other talk and listened to what they had to say, he wouldn\u2019t have put his foot in his mouth.", "NTA, he earned his embarrassment and may he learn from it in the future.", "Oh wow so NTA, he embarrassed himself by being such an embarrassment.", "NTA. I hope the embarrassment he feels makes him never act that way again. But that might just be wishful thinking.", "ESH and you sound pretty pretentious", "I work in a university and this happens to me all the time, but mostly with undergrads. I\u2019m also the only indigenous woman in my department and I absolutely know what OP was referring to with fighting for a seat at the table.\n\nIt\u2019s a no-win situation for me because if I say something, then I\u2019m labeled as a pompous know-it-all. I don\u2019t say anything, then people get mad at me for not disclosing information sooner and allowing them to embarrass themselves. I\u2019ve learned to say that my credentials are all listed online and if they\u2019re truly curious, they can look them up on their own time. NTA", "Haha, I will speak here about a story with my HS teacher.\n\nShe has a very thick accent and is of colour.  And a f****** degree in science, but many students will try to correct her while I am just sitting there feeling 2nd hand embarrassment", "Right?? I hope these same people are texting that dude and saying \"It was so rude of you to quiz OP all night on her profession.\"", "I\u2019m a family medicine resident and I was recently having a conversation with a friend who recently had a baby about pregnancy. She was telling me how terrified she was because she had some pretty serious complications and had to be induced early. Her brother interrupts to say something like 100% wrong and I started to correct him. He goes \u201chow would you know, are you a doctor?\u201d And when I said that I was in fact a doctor and I even deliver babies, he accused me of rubbing my occupation in his face.", "A few weeks ago I watched a random man (not a lawyer) start mansplaining to a group of lawyers how federal criminal law works. A couple of people interrupted to say, that's not actually the law, but he just bulldozed through everyone because he obviously knew better. He was going on and on about what a lawyer had argued in a big appellate case just handed down.\n\nOne of the women interrupted him, and said, \"Actually, what the case argued was X.\"\n\n\"No, no! It's clear you haven't actually read the case! What the attorney argued was [something insane]. You've completely misunderstood the appellate defender's argument!\"\n\n3rd person: \"Um ... you know she's the lawyer that wrote it, right?\"\n\nDude rapidly switched to claiming that the case had clearly been wrongly decided, when he'd been talking about how brilliant it was 30 seconds before.", "And I, a father, had to put up with years of womensplaining from random women about how to raise my children. Including women with no children, who still somehow knew better.", "I like the phrase \"spilled the spaghetti\".", "Yup. Another man know it all. SMH. Well at least he had the grace to be embarrassed. I've heard stories where dudes will try and continue to argue even after finding out to try and save face...NTA", "You are right.  He could have avoided embarrassment if he had asked her if she had read it, what did she think of this part or this thought, etc.  Basically if he had asked her for her thoughts at any point rather than just telling her about it.", ">\"You should have told him your credentials.\"\n\nIt's not like he asked...", "This is it! OP\u2014your knowledge is sufficient in and of itself. The fact that these \u201cfriends\u201d reprimanded you for not letting them know how educated you were is a huge red flag. Who cares how educated you are? They should respect your voice  if they respect you as a friend at all!", "Not that it justifies any of the rest of this, but with many social introductions being just first name and papers generally talked about based off of last name (and sometimes not even including first names), the one bit of his actions that is defensible would be not realizing that the person he was talking to was a coauthor on that paper on the basis of names given.", "Yes!

I guess I was trying to imagine what the other academics in the group with them were interpreting from the situation. In my group (and groups do differ) plenty of people have blow hard students, and there\u2019s a level that we all kind of sport with them/each other. At the point where a student gets upset/embarrassed, the situation has crossed a line (even if objectively you are not at fault!) and it\u2019s kind of on you to reel them back in. Not just let them marinate in their own self inflicted misery... Because for us the end goal is then learning/growing/becoming part of the academy.  I think it really depends how the tone of all this was going, and I can\u2019t really tell. A student so excited that they\u2019re a bit of a bore when they have the opportunity to socialize with others in their field is very different from being next to some rando who is trying to explain to you that the moon landing was faked.
