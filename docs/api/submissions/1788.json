When I make either of those, I cook chicken for him - same recipe I use for the pork, I just put it in it's own pan and cook it at the same time. I throw a marinated chicken breast on the grill for him when I do burgers. It isn't hard and takes next to no time.  You don't need to rearrange your menu plan entirely, but  \"I tried not to make it\" is BS - it's not that you needed to avoid making meatloaf for your kids at home, it's that you couldn't take an extra 5 minutes to accomodate your visiting daughter by throwing a piece of chicken or something in the oven along with the meatloaf. \n\nHere's the thing, Actions speak louder than words. If your daughter is such a burden that you'd rather she not visit, you need to come out and say so to her face rather than being passive-agressive about it by cooking a meal that she hates not once, but TWICE in a less-than-seven-day time span and refusing to take a few minutes to add something she'd be willing to eat. That's what your actions are saying. YTA", "YTA It\u2019s not that hard not to make meatloaf for a week, even with picky kids.

Or give her warning so she could make other plans? Or just make one of the other foods they eat since surely they are not living on meatloaf???

I have children the same age as you - making a meal your college aged daughter hates and asked you not to make TWICE in one week is ridiculous.

It seems like your view is that she's an adult and should handle herself (ok) and her view is that she would like to come home and feel she is can be a teen again (ok). The mismatch is likely the problem. You could ask her to make a meal for everyone. You could save meatloaf from one meal for the next meal for the younger kids and make something else for everyone else for the second meal. What you chose go do was ignore her request and be passive aggressive instead of solving the problem like the adult and the message was that you care about pleasing the younger kids and not her.

If so, NTA, being a mom is hard! Or was it a normal week for you, where making meatloaf felt more convenient? If so, I would say slight YTA. Your two youngest might be picky, but why doesn't your eldest's food preferences matter as much - especially when she's only home for one week? I also feel like their might be tension or a pattern here, as even reading your comments about your 'nagging daughter' and seeing how you doubt her own fatigue ('claims to be too tired' versus 'is too tired') makes me err on the side of YTA.

You like your meatloaf fusion dish", "Okay that's cool cause that's all it is opinions", "WTF??", "Boy bye", "You can use reduced sodium seasonings, rice or oats instead of breadcrumbs, and turkey instead of beef, all of which are healthier alternatives to the \u201ctraditional\u201d recipe. Any sauce is optional. Meatloaf *can* be unhealthy, depending on what\u2019s in it.", "As far from healthy?\n\nI think you're sorely mistaken.\n\nYou can also make meatloaf that are quite healthy using lean ground meat, oats, more seasoning/less salt, etc.\n\nIt may not be fish with wild rice, but it's absolutely not \"as far from healthy as you can get\"", "Do all you N T A guys\u2019 families hate you or something? Like damn, I\u2019m 30 and if I go visit my family for a few days, my parents *insist* on fixing food they know I enjoy and *pester* me to tell them what dishes I\u2019d like or what I haven\u2019t had in a while. How do so many people on this thread have the mentality of \u201cshe\u2019s grown, so fuck her she can cook for herself\u201d? The younger siblings aren\u2019t *toddlers,* they\u2019re 9 and 13. I don\u2019t believe for a second that they\u2019re so picky, OP *had* to fix the one thing their older daughter hates *twice.* OP told her that she\u2019d \u201ctry\u201d not to fix meatloaf, and proceeded to fix it *more* than usual. That absolutely sends a message on OP\u2019s part, and that message is shitty. The daughter\u2019s reaction was maybe a little overblown, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s probably not about the meatloaf itself. I suspect it\u2019s not the first time something along these lines has happened, with older daughter\u2019s wants getting pushed aside to cater to the younger sibs, or OP deciding that it wasn\u2019t important to honor older daughter\u2019s requests.\n\n I dunno what \u2018struggle\u2019 you think OP is dealing with that daughter needs to understand.", "Grown children still deserve to not be an afterthought.", "because said 25 year old is visiting their family for the week and op is already making dinner for everyone? is it so hard to take them into account for like a week? i\u2019m sure meatloaf is not the single meal that everyone would like, and the kids would like?", "No reason to insult your parent over a fucking meatloaf.

Whenever I visit home, my mom always cooks things I like because I get to visit just once in 1-2 years. My mom would lose it if she saw me cooking something for myself and take over. I\u2019m not lazy or whatever. I contribute in other ways while I\u2019m home.", "Eh? Wrong post?", "I wonder who you keep giving meatloaf to in your life as you are triggered.", "Ok"]}
