Also, it\u2019s shitty to excuse your younger kids pickiness and then yell at your daughter for it. 13 is also old enough to make a sandwich or pack of mac and cheese if they don\u2019t like dinner.

When I make either of those, I cook chicken for him - same recipe I use for the pork, I just put it in it's own pan and cook it at the same time. I throw a marinated chicken breast on the grill for him when I do burgers. It isn't hard and takes next to no time.  You don't need to rearrange your menu plan entirely, but  \"I tried not to make it\" is BS - it's not that you needed to avoid making meatloaf for your kids at home, it's that you couldn't take an extra 5 minutes to accomodate your visiting daughter by throwing a piece of chicken or something in the oven along with the meatloaf. \n\nHere's the thing, Actions speak louder than words. If your daughter is such a burden that you'd rather she not visit, you need to come out and say so to her face rather than being passive-agressive about it by cooking a meal that she hates not once, but TWICE in a less-than-seven-day time span and refusing to take a few minutes to add something she'd be willing to eat.

Or give her warning so she could make other plans? Or just make one of the other foods they eat since surely they are not living on meatloaf???

I have children the same age as you - making a meal your college aged daughter hates and asked you not to make TWICE in one week is ridiculous.

It seems like your view is that she's an adult and should handle herself (ok) and her view is that she would like to come home and feel she is can be a teen again (ok). The mismatch is likely the problem. You could ask her to make a meal for everyone. You could save meatloaf from one meal for the next meal for the younger kids and make something else for everyone else for the second meal. What you chose go do was ignore her request and be passive aggressive instead of solving the problem like the adult and the message was that you care about pleasing the younger kids and not her.

If so, NTA, being a mom is hard! Or was it a normal week for you, where making meatloaf felt more convenient? If so, I would say slight YTA. Your two youngest might be picky, but why doesn't your eldest's food preferences matter as much - especially when she's only home for one week? I also feel like their might be tension or a pattern here, as even reading your comments about your 'nagging daughter' and seeing how you doubt her own fatigue ('claims to be too tired' versus 'is too tired') makes me err on the side of YTA.

Like, was there a salad?  Even if the kids wouldn't eat it?  Some vegetables thrown on a pan and roasting with the meatloaf?  Baked potatoes?  Loaded baked potatoes can totally be a meal and throwing a few potatoes into the oven with the meatloaf would have been essentially zero additional effort.

But there are absolutely books, blogs, podcasts, so much stuff out there now for picky eaters, and you can talk to the pediatrician (or look up online for some basics) to see if it is more than picky eating.

When he was born, I was surprised at how I didn\u2019t feel a huge surge of \u201cmaternal love\u201d for him. Of course I love him, but it wasn\u2019t any crazy unique love I\u2019d never experienced before. I didn\u2019t have postpartum depression or anything, just a weird feeling that I didn\u2019t unlock the *real* mom love yet. \n\nOver time, as I\u2019ve watched him grow, I\u2019ve realized something. \n\nThere are only 3 people I\u2019ve ever felt this way for. My son, my sister, and my brother. \n\nWhen I was 14 I would wake up in a panic, sweating and anxious like I\u2019d just gone on a run. This happened when I had nightmares about something happening to my little brother. Some nights I just couldn\u2019t fall asleep, and not because of my usual insomnia. The cure was the same: I\u2019d go poke my head in the cracked door of my brothers room first, then go peek at my sister too. I do the same thing for my son, nowadays. \n\nWhen it\u2019s time to eat, I don\u2019t have to be reminded to get my son his food before I get my own. It\u2019s just sort of\u2026 instinct? I do similar things for my siblings. If I\u2019m getting myself a snack, I bring extras - just in case they want one. If I got a blanket for myself, I make sure to pick a big one that\u2019ll fit whoever else needs to warm up too. \n\nI could go on and on, but I think the message is clear. **I didn\u2019t notice the maternal love I had for my son, because I\u2019d already experienced it with my siblings.** It is literally the same feeling. When my brother texts me, I drop whatever I\u2019m doing to help. Just like if my son yells \u201chey moooommm\u201d from his room. If my sister gets home from dance class and doesn\u2019t have a water yet, I\u2019ll go get her one.

I like to think I\u2019ve made a safe space for them in having my own place! \n\nI still get opportunities to \u201cmom\u201d them from afar though! My brother calls so I can walk him through how to make ramen (the instructions are *on the bag*, but I digress) or give him dating advice. My sister comes over so I can help her with homework or distract her from the stress of life. \n\nIt\u2019s different, but *better* different. \n\nBest wishes to you too!! <3", "Thanks! \nI'd be kinda ticked about the rice too! \ud83e\udd23"]}
