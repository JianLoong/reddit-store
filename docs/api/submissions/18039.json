When our daughter was eight, she developed a very rare mouth infection that just absolutely devestated her teeth and gums. She ended up losing all her teeth in both sets, and had to have some corrective work done just so she could have regular dentures. Obviously this was very traumatic for her, and she's still in therapy to help cope to this day.\n\nOur daughter is understandably very self-conscious about this. None of her friends knew about them, in fact nobody besides her doctor and dentist know outside the family, she doesn't want people to know. She's very worried about people finding out, and won't even take her teeth out in front of the rest of us, she's worried someone will see.\n\nHer and her brother had a good relationship until he did what he did last week. He somehow recorded her taking out her teeth without her noticing, and then showed all her friends when they were over. Not only have they all turned on her, but half the school is teasing her nonstop, she even had to change her phone number because dozens of kids were texting her the most vile things imagineable.\n\nI have never been more ashamed of one of my children until that moment, I don't know where we went wrong raising him, but apparently he thought it would be funny. After I kicked out her \"friends\" who were mocking her and helped her through a panic attack, I called my father to pick him up, and told him to pack a bag and get the fuck out. He's been staying with my parents two towns over, they didn't know what happened until two days ago.\n\nThat came up because driving him to school was becoming a hassle, and they wanted to know what was up. When I explained they were disgusted, but still wanted to know when they could bring him home. I asked them if they'd take care of registering him for school in their town, and they agreed but were shocked. My husband and I talked, and we just cannot have him here. \n\nHis sister hates him, we're so ashamed we can't even think of calling him. It sounds awful but I don't think our relationship can recover from this, and maybe this is what he needs. No friends, no family aside from his grandparents, having to start over might just set him right.

Switch her schools if necessary. Get her therapy. Of course punish your son. He deserves it. No this is not overly extreme. What he did is inexcusable.

Didn't mean for it to blow up the way it did.

You can't legally or ethically shun or banish a 16 year old. There's a reason the court system for juveniles is different than adult court- it's understood that their brains aren't fully developed. Get counseling for yourself, your daughter and your son. Figure out how to support your daughter as she learns to live with her body. Figure out how to parent your son as he learns about reparations and redemption and rebuilding relationships.", "NTA 16 is old enough to know right from wrong. everyone commenting therapy for what? the kid purposely embarrassed his own sister. like traumatically and still thinks it\u2019s funny. keep him at his grandparents.", "ESH\n\nWhat he did was stupid, horrible and absolutely cruel. He should have never done that to his sister. I can only imagine he would do it just as a stupid prank (as many guys his age do), or out of jealousy.\nEither way what he did was unjustified and deserving of a punishment. \n\nBut you've completely overreacted. You've completely disowned your son for a single mistake. It's obvious you're letting your decisions be controlled by your emotions, because this isn't the right way to do things. \nWhat you're doing is immature. You need to discipline him, yes. But so he can understand what he did was wrong. So he can become better. \n\nAnd seeing from your comments, it's clear that you don't want to talk with him. Which is only going to cause more problems. He's 16. Still a child. But now he's going to have to grow up and face the world knowing his parents don't love him. For the next two years of his life, he'll only have bus grandparents. Then he's on his own. I could understand your position if this was a repetitive thing. If he was a constant terror for his sister and for you and your partner. But this was a one time thing. \n\nI really hope you call make more mature decisions and help your family come together one day. But I don't think that's possible. He might have caused a rift between the family, but you're the ones who solidified it. Right now, you're fuelled by emotion. But there might come a day where you will have to face the fact that you may never see your son again. I hope you can live with that.", "ESH, except Grandparents and daughter. Just like others have said, you really can't throw a child away. The only way I could agree with disownment is if your son had done this once he was fully adult (later 20's) so with full knowledge and maturity before the action. Since that isn't the case, having minimal contact with him does absolutely no good and may even reinforce the reason he thought it would be \"funny\" to do this. Both your children need therapy, and you and your husband may need it as well. You need to find out WHY your son felt this was an appropriate action and then address the situation (this is why therapy is crucial). The fact that you ARE too emotionally charged in support of your daughter suggests that for some reason you have been putting a lot of focus on her and have likely turned her into a \"golden child\", even if you never meant to, so your son lashed out the only way he felt he could in an attempt to get your attention. Your reaction has likely reinforced his belief that only his sister matters and you don't love him anymore and haven't for some years. Your own actions have now reached a point where you are about to lose a child and that child is likely your son by his own choice since his parents clearly don't care about him anymore (from his point of view...and frankly from the 3rd person point of view as well). Unfortunately you have reached a \"rock and a hard place\" scenario with your children where it will cause harm to your daughter to have her brother around her and could lead to her cutting all ties with the family at her earliest opportunity if he is around, yet not allowing your son to be with his parents will do the same from him because to him his own parents no longer love him and why should he make himself suffer that pain. The problem is that to help your both your children, one or the other of the children may have to be separated from the immediate family, and that action will cause harm to whichever child is separated from the family leading to no contact once they hit 18.  For your daughter, you need to switch schools for her. At this point that's likely the only way to stop the bullying because it sounds like it has become too widespread in the school that even if the school took action, virtually the entire school would be suspended/expelled and that's just not a feasible thing to do. Depending on the size of your community or school district, you may have to take the drastic measure of moving far enough away that there wouldn't be any interaction with that school even with extracurriculars. Something to help your daughter's self esteem would be to look into permanent implants. She may not be old enough yet, and they will be expensive, but those would take away the need to be removing her teeth so she wouldn't have that perceived embarrassment. For your son you need to PROVE to him that you DO love him, even if you're unhappy with his actions, and find a way to piece your family back together.", "YTA,\n\nHave you ever spent quality time with him, after your daughter's infection started?  If no, then  probably this was his revenge to his sister for taking away all his mom dad's attention.\n\nAnd now instead of talking heart to heart with him, you are sending him away.\n\nAlso, your daughter needs therapy.  What happens when she moves to college dorm, or starts living with bf?  You can't gurde her from everyone's eyes always.", "ESH except your daughter. This entire family needs therapy, sheesh. I can kind of understand the initial gut reaction to not want to have your son in the household for a while\u2026but what you are describing is effectively disowning him. The punishment does not fit the crime. Of course it was awful. But there has to be an examination of what led to that behavior. Something snapped in him that caused the awful behavior and you would only do right as parents to get the therapy needed to help figure out what is going on. \n\nGet individual therapy and family therapy.", "So this sub the silent treatment between adults is abusive!

You haven't even MENTIONED how he reacted to his punishment, how he feels, whether you even TALKED TO HIM about what he did, nothing.

But he needs to come home and he needs to atone for what he did. Maybe counseling for the family would help.", "ESH your reaction is way over the top.", "Of course YTA. Wtf. Yes what he did was fucked but come tf on.... You're a shitty parent, hands down.", "YTA \n\nWhat he did is beyond horrible and he deserves a very harsh punishment. There isn't any excuse for what he did and I'm not excusing or downplaying it.\n\nBut you can't just throw your child away when they do something wrong, the fact that you refuse to even speak to him is massively not okay.
