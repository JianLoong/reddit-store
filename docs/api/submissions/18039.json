{"id": 18039, "submission_id": "13qbrl5", "title": "AITA for sending our son away after he revealed to his sister's friends that she has dentures?", "selftext": "My husband and I have a 14 year old daughter and a 16 year old son. When our daughter was eight, she developed a very rare mouth infection that just absolutely devestated her teeth and gums. She ended up losing all her teeth in both sets, and had to have some corrective work done just so she could have regular dentures. Obviously this was very traumatic for her, and she's still in therapy to help cope to this day.\n\nOur daughter is understandably very self-conscious about this. None of her friends knew about them, in fact nobody besides her doctor and dentist know outside the family, she doesn't want people to know. She's very worried about people finding out, and won't even take her teeth out in front of the rest of us, she's worried someone will see.\n\nHer and her brother had a good relationship until he did what he did last week. He somehow recorded her taking out her teeth without her noticing, and then showed all her friends when they were over. Not only have they all turned on her, but half the school is teasing her nonstop, she even had to change her phone number because dozens of kids were texting her the most vile things imagineable.\n\nI have never been more ashamed of one of my children until that moment, I don't know where we went wrong raising him, but apparently he thought it would be funny. After I kicked out her \"friends\" who were mocking her and helped her through a panic attack, I called my father to pick him up, and told him to pack a bag and get the fuck out. He's been staying with my parents two towns over, they didn't know what happened until two days ago.\n\nThat came up because driving him to school was becoming a hassle, and they wanted to know what was up. When I explained they were disgusted, but still wanted to know when they could bring him home. I asked them if they'd take care of registering him for school in their town, and they agreed but were shocked. My husband and I talked, and we just cannot have him here. \n\nHis sister hates him, we're so ashamed we can't even think of calling him. It sounds awful but I don't think our relationship can recover from this, and maybe this is what he needs. No friends, no family aside from his grandparents, having to start over might just set him right. My parents are willing to keep him until he's 18, but think we're too emotionally charged to be making this decision now.", "created_utc": 1684904550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qbrl5/aita_for_sending_our_son_away_after_he_revealed/", "score": 10806, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now to your daughter... she will need major support and unconditional love at this time. Kids are so cruel! I can only imagine the bullying and torment she must be going through. Switch her schools if necessary. Get her therapy. Of course punish your son. He deserves it. No this is not overly extreme. What he did is inexcusable.

Didn't mean for it to blow up the way it did.

You can't legally or ethically shun or banish a 16 year old. There's a reason the court system for juveniles is different than adult court- it's understood that their brains aren't fully developed.

Figure out how to parent your son as he learns about reparations and redemption and rebuilding relationships.", "NTA 16 is old enough to know right from wrong. everyone commenting therapy for what? the kid purposely embarrassed his own sister. like traumatically and still thinks it\u2019s funny. keep him at his grandparents.", "ESH\n\nWhat he did was stupid, horrible and absolutely cruel. He should have never done that to his sister. I can only imagine he would do it just as a stupid prank (as many guys his age do), or out of jealousy.\nEither way what he did was unjustified and deserving of a punishment. \n\nBut you've completely overreacted. You've completely disowned your son for a single mistake. It's obvious you're letting your decisions be controlled by your emotions, because this isn't the right way to do things. \nWhat you're doing is immature. You need to discipline him, yes. But so he can understand what he did was wrong. So he can become better. \n\nAnd seeing from your comments, it's clear that you don't want to talk with him. Which is only going to cause more problems. He's 16. Still a child. But now he's going to have to grow up and face the world knowing his parents don't love him. For the next two years of his life, he'll only have bus grandparents. Then he's on his own. I could understand your position if this was a repetitive thing. If he was a constant terror for his sister and for you and your partner. But this was a one time thing. \n\nI really hope you call make more mature decisions and help your family come together one day. But I don't think that's possible. He might have caused a rift between the family, but you're the ones who solidified it. Right now, you're fuelled by emotion. But there might come a day where you will have to face the fact that you may never see your son again. I hope you can live with that.", "ESH, except Grandparents and daughter. Just like others have said, you really can't throw a child away. The only way I could agree with disownment is if your son had done this once he was fully adult (later 20's) so with full knowledge and maturity before the action. Since that isn't the case, having minimal contact with him does absolutely no good and may even reinforce the reason he thought it would be \"funny\" to do this. Both your children need therapy, and you and your husband may need it as well. You need to find out WHY your son felt this was an appropriate action and then address the situation (this is why therapy is crucial). The fact that you ARE too emotionally charged in support of your daughter suggests that for some reason you have been putting a lot of focus on her and have likely turned her into a \"golden child\", even if you never meant to, so your son lashed out the only way he felt he could in an attempt to get your attention. Your reaction has likely reinforced his belief that only his sister matters and you don't love him anymore and haven't for some years. Your own actions have now reached a point where you are about to lose a child and that child is likely your son by his own choice since his parents clearly don't care about him anymore (from his point of view...and frankly from the 3rd person point of view as well). Unfortunately you have reached a \"rock and a hard place\" scenario with your children where it will cause harm to your daughter to have her brother around her and could lead to her cutting all ties with the family at her earliest opportunity if he is around, yet not allowing your son to be with his parents will do the same from him because to him his own parents no longer love him and why should he make himself suffer that pain. The problem is that to help your both your children, one or the other of the children may have to be separated from the immediate family, and that action will cause harm to whichever child is separated from the family leading to no contact once they hit 18.  For your daughter, you need to switch schools for her. At this point that's likely the only way to stop the bullying because it sounds like it has become too widespread in the school that even if the school took action, virtually the entire school would be suspended/expelled and that's just not a feasible thing to do. Depending on the size of your community or school district, you may have to take the drastic measure of moving far enough away that there wouldn't be any interaction with that school even with extracurriculars. Something to help your daughter's self esteem would be to look into permanent implants. She may not be old enough yet, and they will be expensive, but those would take away the need to be removing her teeth so she wouldn't have that perceived embarrassment. For your son you need to PROVE to him that you DO love him, even if you're unhappy with his actions, and find a way to piece your family back together.", "YTA,\n\nHave you ever spent quality time with him, after your daughter's infection started?  If no, then  probably this was his revenge to his sister for taking away all his mom dad's attention.\n\nAnd now instead of talking heart to heart with him, you are sending him away.\n\nAlso, your daughter needs better therapy, if  6 years after incident,  only copping mechanism she has, is hiding .  What happens when she moves to college dorm, or starts living with bf?  You can't gurde her from everyone's eyes always.", "ESH except your daughter. This entire family needs therapy, sheesh. I can kind of understand the initial gut reaction to not want to have your son in the household for a while\u2026but what you are describing is effectively disowning him. The punishment does not fit the crime. Of course it was awful. But there has to be an examination of what led to that behavior. Something snapped in him that caused the awful behavior and you would only do right as parents to get the therapy needed to help figure out what is going on. \n\nGet individual therapy and family therapy.", "So this sub the silent treatment between adults is abusive!

It's cruel.\n\nSpeak to a therapist about your feelings of anger, disappointment and shame.

This is not emotionally mature, but nor is he, he's a kid. He won't learn how to take responsibility for his choices if no one takes the time to properly teach him.\n\nAll kids make stupid choices, and in the world of the internet it's much easier to share your stupidity with the world.

I know I would've shared something inappropriate, I hate to think what a mess I could've created.\n\nYour son made a stupid, thoughtless choice. But he isn't psychic. Therapy can help him either learn how to take responsibility for his actions and then how to process his deep shame, or if he doesn't have those feelings, he can learn what is and isn't appropriate.

Probably thinks his parents don\u2019t love him anymore and he\u2019s already ruined everything. You should be talking to him and working to figure out why this happened with him.

The son basically got off free, I don't think he cares that his parents aren't talking to him as he still thinks what he did was funny and the correct thing to do.\n\nI have no sympathy for that son of theirs, if he was a stranger to them or a nephew or a friend of the sons and that boy did that to their daughter, this would be a whole different story and all of you would be pissed off as the friend for violating the sister but because he's the son that changes things? He did a vile inhuman thing and whatever punishment he receives is at the discretion of the parents and not us.\n\nLike I said, I don't know how to rate this one cos it's majorly fucked up and way beyond my scope of understanding.

My parents saw what was happening to me, and after a LOT of begging, I had corrective eye muscle surgery when I was in 7th grade that cosmetically fixed the issue (though the eye no longer \"sees\" anything beyond light and movement).\n\nThings did get better after the surgery but kids remember. I was still bullied for that issue all through high school. Moving FAR away and starting college was the first time in my life I felt like I could have a normal relationship with my peers.

It\u2019s ok if for her daughter\u2019s safety the son needs to stay elsewhere, but it needs to be communicated and part of an actual plan to discipline him and show him how wrong he was to do what he did.

I guess they also feel guilty, because it seems that their upbringing went wrong. They are disturbed and deeply disappointed. Like he is 16,he should understand by now. He literally made his sister's life a nightmare.\n\nI honestly don't know how to solve such problem - getting him out of house, won't solve it, it's cruel.

And yes you can say your parents should have put him into therapy, we were all in therapy. Some people are just evil and don't deserve to be around their victims anymore. Destroying his sister's life is an incredibly serious offense. The trauma from this is never ever going to go away. His behavior is unconscionable and unforgivable and he probably did it for likes online. There is absolutely no justification for this kind of bullying. Quite frankly I have to agree with the parents because I was the victimized sibling in this scenario when I was a child and it never goes away.

I agree that he must be severely punished but I think the girl should go to another town or school since as we read this one is full of a-holes. So she must be protected from the bullying.

There is nothing in the post saying that the brother was an \"invisible child\", or that he's been neglected growing up.

Yes, the parent should absolutely talk to their son to try and figure out what he was thinking.

Just because he thought it'll be fun.", "really agree that something is odd that daughter suddenly has no one. i know kids can be brutal, so i can believe she is having a hard time at school in general & receiving mean messages... but to have no friends? zero? over a medical condition?? screams missing reasons.\n\nit also doesn't sound like the son sent it to people at all. it sounds like he only showed the video TO HER FRIENDS? which means the friends are the ones who spread this information around the school in the first place?!\n\nson is absolutely to blame for videoing his sister & showing that video to her friends, but i don't think he's entirely to blame for the school situation because i can't see where he is the one who spread it around at school.\n\n&, this is just me speaking from experience of going to school with family members who had one persona at home & another at school, it kind of sounds to me like she may have been a mean girl. maybe not to everyone at large, but at least to her brother. because him specifically filming something he knows she is hiding & in therapy for & showing her friends seems like a revenge ploy of some kind. it does not seem like random nastiness out of the blue.", "If the 16 year old had physically or sexually abused his sister would all these people be as gung-ho about not removing him from the home and allowing him access to his sister? The parents did the right thing by removing his access to her. There is something wrong with someone if they are willing to destroy someone the way he did.", "Sometimes people use \"mistake\" and \"accident\" almost interchangeably. And some people don't.\n\nWhere I am from making a mistake is used more as \"you fucked up\" or \"you shouldn't have done that\" in instances where there is remorse after the fact. But it doesn't really address whether the act was intentional at all.\n\nSo in my circles, if he was remorseful, it is correct to say he made a major mistake.  But also that his mistake was not at all accidental or unintended.", "It's a tragic situation, in large part because the son is not ever going to learn from this. He did something so casually monstrous, with full knowledge of what the consequences would be (because sixteen year olds lack wisdom, patience, and perspective, but not raw intelligence. He knew exactly what the likely outcome would be. He aimed for it.) that honestly...what are you going to say to him?\n\nThat it was bad? He thinks it was a cool exploit.\n\nHis sister is suffering? Yes, he knows this. Mission accomplished. Well done, kid. \n\nThere will be long term consequences? He doesn't care. It's not that he will never care, though, it's just that by the time he does, years will have passed, and everyone's lives will be different. \n\n\nBasically, there's no way on earth to go from the son doing this, to the son being meaningfully sorry for doing it, in less than, oh, call it five to ten years. He won't learn until he's literally a different person.\n\n\nAnd then he'll probably still just blame the sister for everything, because people are REALLY BAD at actually dealing with being wrong and having done wrong. \n\nHe's going to find it much easier to spend his life hating his sister than feeling guilty for what he did to her.", ">OP's son literally ruined her entire life. She will only get relief from this if she changes schools.\n\nAs horrible as it may seem, what I would have done if I were OP would have been to pack up my daughter and move in with my parents two towns away. Not to punish the girl but to give her a chance to start over. The boy can stay with the father. Teens kill themselves over less than this.", "I mean shit he\u2019s 16?!? He knows what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong. He knew how scared she was of people finding out. She will never look at her brother the same again.", "I feel so bad for your daughter. That seems like her absolute worst nightmare come to life. Please keep supporting her and continue therapy, such an awful situation. \n\nNTA and I don't blame you for reacting the way you did. I have no advice on how to move forward this is way out of my wheelhouse and others have provided better advice. \n\nGood luck.", "As a kid with a lazy eye I couldn't hide, being bullied for a disability doesn't \"kick you out of school\"", "Well I imagine life got a little less pleasant for him after the grandparents found out why."]}
