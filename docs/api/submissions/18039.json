{"id": 18039, "submission_id": "13qbrl5", "title": "AITA for sending our son away after he revealed to his sister's friends that she has dentures?", "selftext": "My husband and I have a 14 year old daughter and a 16 year old son. When our daughter was eight, she developed a very rare mouth infection that just absolutely devestated her teeth and gums. She ended up losing all her teeth in both sets, and had to have some corrective work done just so she could have regular dentures. Obviously this was very traumatic for her, and she's still in therapy to help cope to this day.\n\nOur daughter is understandably very self-conscious about this. None of her friends knew about them, in fact nobody besides her doctor and dentist know outside the family, she doesn't want people to know. She's very worried about people finding out, and won't even take her teeth out in front of the rest of us, she's worried someone will see.\n\nHer and her brother had a good relationship until he did what he did last week. He somehow recorded her taking out her teeth without her noticing, and then showed all her friends when they were over. Not only have they all turned on her, but half the school is teasing her nonstop, she even had to change her phone number because dozens of kids were texting her the most vile things imagineable.\n\nI have never been more ashamed of one of my children until that moment, I don't know where we went wrong raising him, but apparently he thought it would be funny. After I kicked out her \"friends\" who were mocking her and helped her through a panic attack, I called my father to pick him up, and told him to pack a bag and get the fuck out. He's been staying with my parents two towns over, they didn't know what happened until two days ago.\n\nThat came up because driving him to school was becoming a hassle, and they wanted to know what was up. When I explained they were disgusted, but still wanted to know when they could bring him home. I asked them if they'd take care of registering him for school in their town, and they agreed but were shocked. My husband and I talked, and we just cannot have him here. \n\nHis sister hates him, we're so ashamed we can't even think of calling him. It sounds awful but I don't think our relationship can recover from this, and maybe this is what he needs. No friends, no family aside from his grandparents, having to start over might just set him right. My parents are willing to keep him until he's 18, but think we're too emotionally charged to be making this decision now.", "created_utc": 1684904550, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qbrl5/aita_for_sending_our_son_away_after_he_revealed/", "score": 820, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Switch her schools if necessary. Get her therapy. Of course punish your son. He deserves it. No this is not overly extreme. What he did is inexcusable.

You can't legally or ethically shun or banish a 16 year old. There's a reason the court system for juveniles is different than adult court- it's understood that their brains aren't fully developed.

Figure out how to parent your son as he learns about reparations and redemption and rebuilding relationships.", "NTA 16 is old enough to know right from wrong. everyone commenting therapy for what? the kid purposely embarrassed his own sister. like traumatically and still thinks it\u2019s funny. keep him at his grandparents.", "ESH\n\nWhat he did was stupid, horrible and absolutely cruel. He should have never done that to his sister. I can only imagine he would do it just as a stupid prank (as many guys his age do), or out of jealousy.\nEither way what he did was unjustified and deserving of a punishment. \n\nBut you've completely overreacted. You've completely disowned your son for a single mistake. It's obvious you're letting your decisions be controlled by your emotions, because this isn't the right way to do things. \nWhat you're doing is immature. You need to discipline him, yes. But so he can understand what he did was wrong. So he can become better. \n\nAnd seeing from your comments, it's clear that you don't want to talk with him. Which is only going to cause more problems. He's 16. Still a child. But now he's going to have to grow up and face the world knowing his parents don't love him. For the next two years of his life, he'll only have bus grandparents. Then he's on his own. I could understand your position if this was a repetitive thing. If he was a constant terror for his sister and for you and your partner. But this was a one time thing. \n\nI really hope you call make more mature decisions and help your family come together one day. But I don't think that's possible. He might have caused a rift between the family, but you're the ones who solidified it. Right now, you're fuelled by emotion. But there might come a day where you will have to face the fact that you may never see your son again. I hope you can live with that.", "ESH, except Grandparents and daughter. Just like others have said, you really can't throw a child away. The only way I could agree with disownment is if your son had done this once he was fully adult (later 20's) so with full knowledge and maturity before the action. Since that isn't the case, having minimal contact with him does absolutely no good and may even reinforce the reason he thought it would be \"funny\" to do this. Both your children need therapy, and you and your husband may need it as well. You need to find out WHY your son felt this was an appropriate action and then address the situation (this is why therapy is crucial). The fact that you ARE too emotionally charged in support of your daughter suggests that for some reason you have been putting a lot of focus on her and have likely turned her into a \"golden child\", even if you never meant to, so your son lashed out the only way he felt he could in an attempt to get your attention. Your reaction has likely reinforced his belief that only his sister matters and you don't love him anymore and haven't for some years. Your own actions have now reached a point where you are about to lose a child and that child is likely your son by his own choice since his parents clearly don't care about him anymore (from his point of view...and frankly from the 3rd person point of view as well). Unfortunately you have reached a \"rock and a hard place\" scenario with your children where it will cause harm to your daughter to have her brother around her and could lead to her cutting all ties with the family at her earliest opportunity if he is around, yet not allowing your son to be with his parents will do the same from him because to him his own parents no longer love him and why should he make himself suffer that pain. The problem is that to help your both your children, one or the other of the children may have to be separated from the immediate family, and that action will cause harm to whichever child is separated from the family leading to no contact once they hit 18.  For your daughter, you need to switch schools for her. At this point that's likely the only way to stop the bullying because it sounds like it has become too widespread in the school that even if the school took action, virtually the entire school would be suspended/expelled and that's just not a feasible thing to do. Depending on the size of your community or school district, you may have to take the drastic measure of moving far enough away that there wouldn't be any interaction with that school even with extracurriculars. Something to help your daughter's self esteem would be to look into permanent implants. She may not be old enough yet, and they will be expensive, but those would take away the need to be removing her teeth so she wouldn't have that perceived embarrassment. For your son you need to PROVE to him that you DO love him, even if you're unhappy with his actions, and find a way to piece your family back together.", "YTA,\n\nHave you ever spent quality time with him, after your daughter's infection started?  If no, then  probably this was his revenge to his sister for taking away all his mom dad's attention.\n\nAnd now instead of talking heart to heart with him, you are sending him away.\n\nAlso, your daughter needs better therapy, if  6 years after incident,  only copping mechanism she has, is hiding .  What happens when she moves to college dorm, or starts living with bf?  You can't gurde her from everyone's eyes always.", "ESH except your daughter. This entire family needs therapy, sheesh. I can kind of understand the initial gut reaction to not want to have your son in the household for a while\u2026but what you are describing is effectively disowning him. The punishment does not fit the crime. Of course it was awful. But there has to be an examination of what led to that behavior. Something snapped in him that caused the awful behavior and you would only do right as parents to get the therapy needed to help figure out what is going on. \n\nGet individual therapy and family therapy.", "So this sub the silent treatment between adults is abusive!

You're teaching him that you don't care about him and that if an issue is difficult to talk about, you just reject the other person and ignore them.\n\nIt's not emotionally mature to ignore someone as punishment. It's cruel.\n\nSpeak to a therapist about your feelings of anger, disappointment and shame. Talk about how you don't know how to communicate how deeply your son has impacted his sister, the trauma that resulted from his actions, and the subsequent rejection of your son, how confused, furious and disappointed you are by his lack of understanding.\n\nA good therapist will help you process your feelings, and understand how to broach talking to your son, plus the damage that's being inflicted upon him at the moment.\n\nThis is a very important moment in all of your lives.\n\nYour son made at best a thoughtless choice, but there's no way he could have known the shitstorm that would come from his \"prank\".

He might be in denial that this awful situation was caused by his choices, so he's doubling down in the hope that this whole situation will just go away. This is not emotionally mature, but nor is he, he's a kid. He won't learn how to take responsibility for his choices if no one takes the time to properly teach him.\n\nAll kids make stupid choices, and in the world of the internet it's much easier to share your stupidity with the world. I'm forever grateful it didn't exist when I was a kid because I had a big temper and an innate notion that I was always right. And I was mainly a goodie two shoes. I know I would've shared something inappropriate, I hate to think what a mess I could've created.\n\nYour son made a stupid, thoughtless choice. But he isn't psychic. Therapy can help him either learn how to take responsibility for his actions and then how to process his deep shame, or if he doesn't have those feelings, he can learn what is and isn't appropriate.

Probably thinks his parents don\u2019t love him anymore and he\u2019s already ruined everything. You should be talking to him and working to figure out why this happened with him.

How do you accidentally record someone taking their teeth out and then accidentally show it to anyone who'll look?  Of course it was deliberate!\n\nNow, did he not realise the level of bullying that his sister would endure?  possibly not.  I do believe it's key that he's told the extent and then see how he reacts.\n\nNow, yes obviously OP is disgusted and upset BUT you don't just kick your child out, that's despicable.\n\nDaughter now needs therapy, the school needs to step up too, if bullying is taking place in school (which I'm sure it is)\n\nParents need therapy for how the hell you deal with a situation like this because......damn \n\nSon needs therapy to see why behaviour like this is toxic and to try to wrap his mind around why his family essentially banished him.", "At 16 I absolutely knew that something like this would be an awful, horrible thing to do to someone.", ">People here are going to tell you he knew better, but he did not.\n\nI call BS. OP's son is in high school. He knows full well how cruel kids can be. He also knows how sensitive and private his sister is about having dentures. What he did was not an impulsive slip up where he didn't think through the consequences. He planned this out. And he still thinks it was funny!\n\nWhen I was in high school, there was a girl who had a retainer with a couple of false teeth because she was missing those permanent teeth. She tried to keep it hidden, but a few of us saw her cleaning it in the bathroom after lunch one day. She was really embarrassed and, after explaining what the deal was, asked us not to tell anyone else. You know what we did? We kept it to ourselves. We didn't go around telling people or making fun of her, or taking surreptitious pics/video of her to show others. We understood that we would have felt self conscious in her place, too and didn't want to suffer further embarrassment. \n\nWhat OP's son did was not because he didn't know better or couldn't foresee the consequences. He did it *because* of the consequences. He may not have foreseen the consequences to himself, but he wanted his sister to be laughed at. He wanted to humiliate her. It was 100% deliberate.\n\nI agree with you that he needs help, but for different reasons. He needs help not because he doesn't understand what he did, but because he lacks even basic empathy. And that is disturbing.", "15 is old enough to know right from wrong.", "You're right.", "She's here asking for advice BECAUSE she knows she can't just throw him away.

You don't just stop being parent because your kid did something cruel. You do what is necessary to teach him why what he did was wrong and turn him into a better person.

The brother pulled the plug, but I feel it was bound to come out at some point.\n\nI think it's wrong to allow a 14y old to have such a big secret. On the one hand, it's the girls boundary, but at the same time you enforce the message that it is unbelievable shamefull to have dentures. While, in fact, it is not. And if you keep enforcing the shame, no amount of therapy is going to reduce that. Shame can only live in the dark.\n\nIf she would have been thought that there's nothing to be ashamed of, and she would have experienced aunty Carol not blinking an eye while she takes them out, and played with her friends with the denture gum.

Hs drama ends.", "If it were just a couple of months, I'd agree - but OP is talking about permanent measures and hasn't even bothered to try and talk to him since it happened. \n\nAnd the thing is, if he fails to understand his wrongdoing, it's her job as his parent to teach him to recognise the damage he did, and how to anticipate consequences in order to avoid hurting people again. She can't leave that part of her job to someone else, no matter how angry she is.", "Exactly! Could end up always seeking validation on his choices and actions for fear of extreme consequences like you said.\n\nEither that, or could go the complete opposite way and not care about who he hurts with his actions as \u201cwhat\u2019s the point, my parents already disowned me\u201d", "Parents raise their children.   \n\n\nKids do dumb shit all the time\u2026 but there\u2019s dumb shit and catastrophically mean stuff\u2026 this falls into the latter.   \n\n\nKids act out because they aren\u2019t/haven\u2019t been parented effectively over time. If this was normal then all the teenagers would be doing it, the fact that as parents/a society we have expectations that they won\u2019t / the horror in response to this\u2026 shows that this is abhorrent/abnormal behaviour. That comes from either some form of neglected neurology, or shitty parents.   \n\n\nParents of true socio paths, or neuro diverse kids who are getting supports aren\u2019t posting in here appalled and innocently asking what to do, so that leaves\u2026 parents who have no fucking idea why their kids are shits.", "Perhaps the sister has always been the golden child, have the sons needs always been pushed away in favour of sister. How many times have parents missed things because they were taking sister to doctor/dentists/therapy. How much has the son been ignored because sisters needs are more important? \nMaybe not the case, but could go some way to an explanation. It often happens in households where one child has greater support needs, and the other is pushed aside.\n\nNot saying that makes what he did right, in any way.", "The part where OP decides to foist parenting her son onto other people because she wants to give him the silent treatment? The part where there\u2019s zero history of this child bullying his sister and then he suddenly ruins her reputation? That had to come from somewhere deep. He could also be the \u201cinvisible\u201d sibling, his sister sounds like she had a lot of health problems growing up and it\u2019s common for the family dynamic to change in such a way that the healthy children are emotionally neglected because there\u2019s so much focus placed on the sick child.\n\nI don\u2019t envy OP, this is a shitty situation, but you still have to parent your kids when they mess up.
