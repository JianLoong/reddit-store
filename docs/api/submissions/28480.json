He can take a bus, Lyft, Uber, or bike. \n\nThe fact that he doesn't even pay for gas? No. \n\nI'm an older redditor. I remember those days of being pressured to drive people.

On a day when it is not your turn to drive him home, you need to speak with him and the manager and tell them that you can no longer drive him. You don't have to give them a reason, just tell them that you can no longer do it. It is his responsibility to have reliable transportation.

That's to cover cost of car, maintenance, gas, depreciation, registration, etc.  All the costs of owning and driving a car.   So unless McDonald's is paying you that PLUS the extra time at your regular pay rate (or overtime if it puts you over 40 hours) then you are, according to the IRS, losing that amount.  If the manager is trying to make you do this without pay then they are in violation of labor laws as they are forcing you to work off the clock.\n\nNTA just say you can't do it anymore.  Being asked one time because someone's car broke down or their ride fell through is one thing.  And even then you wouldn't be obligated to say yes.  But having a schedule of other employees to do this?  I think McDonald's corporate would  not be happy about this as it leaves them open to lawsuits (manager makes you do this and you have an accident--you could argue you were working at the direction of McDonald's and demand workmen's comp etc.)\n\nIf the manager gives you any flack or pulls crap like cutting your hours call headquarters ASAP.  Heck, call them anyway.  Maybe they can get the employee transferred.  But learn to say no.  And learn to say it without giving reasons.
