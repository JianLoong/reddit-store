Bonus points if you make him microwave his own meal", "I have been a vegetarian for over 50 years. Check out frozen vegetarian patties. Anything Morningstar Farms makes is pretty good and can be heated in the microwave, oven or air fryer.", "HE WANTS SPECIAL??? HE MAKES SPECIAL AS LONG AS IT ISN'T LIKE SETTING PART ASIDE FOR HIM. IF YOU ARE COOKING AND CAN TAKE PART TO GIVE TO HIM DO SO BUT IF IT GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT DISH TOUGH LUCK BUDDY. THIS IS CALLED CONTROL I WANT TO MAKE IT HARD FOR YOU TO COOK ANYTHING BUT WHAT I WANT", "When it\u2019s his turn to cook does he cook you meat dinners?", "Sorry but do you have small children? Have you ever worked all day, or took care of them all day, and then made dinner? If not, you seriously have no idea what you're talking about", "I feel like soy alone as a protein also brings some other concerns.", "You don\u2019t really take turns cooking if you\u2019re getting 5x/week and he gets 2x.", "The ALA omega-3s found in plant sources need to be converted to EPA/DHA before they can be used by the body and the conversion rate (5-10% for EPA and 0-5% for DHA) is so low that I frankly wouldn't even look towards seeds and nuts as omega-3 sources.", "This. This is the key.", "All great, but he doesn\u2019t then get to raise an issue that she won\u2019t make him a separate vegetarian meal. \n\nAt this point, my mom keeps frozen veggie burgers on hand for my brother (we\u2019re all grown and gone, but for when we\u2019re there) and she\u2019ll throw a bunch of whatever veggies she has on a sheet pan and roast them. That\u2019s pretty much the extent of the accommodation we\u2019re usually willing to make for him at this point. Then again, he\u2019s also extremely inconsistent in his dietary preferences and we\u2019ve all just given up so.", "No, that\u2019s not the best solution. 3/4 of the family eats meat.", "Also shredded chicken and pork, as well as cooked ground beef/turkey, freeze and re-heat pretty darn well. I slow cook a pork butt and then freeze it in big and small ziploc bags. This would be a superfast way to add (non-tofu) protein to meals.", "You can\u2019t explain away all the skinny man tiddies, I\u2019m guessing your angry because you have a rack of your own?", "Kinda sounds like as the SAH parent, your husband could also be working more with your son\u2019s diet.", "I\u2019ll DM you the studies.", "Honey. None of those male athletes have breasts. And I have a rack of my own because I'm a naturally breasted WOMAN.\n\n Possibly the least informed, most embarrassing comeback I've ever heard though \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 you outdid yourself \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "OP added a bunch of comments that change the picture significantly after I posted, sure (which always makes me suspicious: why start with \u2018we take turns cooking\u2019 and then say \u2018actually I do most of it). Though there\u2019s still not enough info to say that the overall division of labor is definitely unfair, we know she\u2019s doing more of the cooking but nothing about everything else is split up. Which returns us to the actual point of the post, which is whether if you\u2019re in agreement it\u2019s your turn to make dinner for the family, you should include the whole family.\n\nAlso, there\u2019s no reason she\u2019d need to make a separate meal every night, as not every meal has meat, and most of the time there\u2019s no need for a whole separate meal, just a slightly different piece of protein prepared along with everything else.", "Ironically though, he expects them to cater to his dietary wants.", "Hey, if it works for you. I just think it sounds bland and boring if done all the time.", "Thank you!", "And somehow still a weird amount of work haha. I see what the other person is saying for her son, but it feels unrealistic and unnecessary here.", "Yeah, if I were OP, I'd get her husband to batch cook, and/or cook for himself."]}
