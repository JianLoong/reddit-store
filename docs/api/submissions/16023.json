If you want to prevent some future fights I'm sure there are some great packaged proteins like tofu breaded bites you can pop in the oven while your family's dinner is cooking for his protein.

I fell in between and can eat anything. I cooked most of the meals at first, then daughter joined in as she was available.\n\nI was able to mostly make meals that were everyone friendly: if I made a spaghetti, I\u2019d make it with meat sauce as well as a veggie sauce and added extra veggies to the meat sauce for us. \n\nIf we had Mexican, I used ground beef for ours, and she used meat substitute crumbles for hers. Everything else was the same.\n\nIf I had a chicken dish, I\u2019d make the chicken separately and add it in after she got her portions. \n\nAnd if we went with a big fresh salad or other light meal, I would add a little turkey or something to my dad\u2019s so he\u2019d still have his protein. \n\nShe did change slightly to pescatarian so seafood made it onto the shopping list. That opened it up a little more. \n\nAnd she didn\u2019t cook meat - and I didn\u2019t require it from her as a teen - so we ate what she did when she wanted to make the meal.\n\nIf none of us wanted to cook, \u201cTV dinners\u201d it was.

I think this situation could be avoided once discussed between the two of you.**\n\nYou can make nearly any dinner vegetarian friendly as long as the meat is on the side. You have a side, veggies or fruits, and make regular protein and a serving of vegetarian protein.\n\nBurgers? It is easy to cook veggie burger & you can always microwave them too! Same with many popular foods now. I'm sure you're not surprised with all of them now, considering your husband is vegetarian!! \n\nAdvice: Keep instant vegetarian meals on hand (good quality ones) for when neither person wants to cook. Their are some that are actually very tasty. I love Amy's brand personally! \n\nAdvice: Make a family vegetarian dinner 1x per week just to expand your kids' palates! I have many favorite veggie dishes, and sometimes it can be fun to try new things", "5he judgement really depends on whether there is an expectation for your husband to cook meat for the rest of the family and vegetarian for him, when it is his turn to cook.

I've lived with non-veg people, and it was rarely an issue. They'd avoid cooking with meat fat if they wanted me to join in the meal; I'd just eat the veggies and heat up a couple of felafels or something if I wanted protein. Alternatively, I'd just get my protein in a different meal. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f Conversely, when I cooked, they'd either eat what I made, eat mine and add meat, or cook their own.
