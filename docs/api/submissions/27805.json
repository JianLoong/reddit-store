She and I talked for a few minutes and she assured me we wouldn't be. I was relieved. Then when we were paired up my stepsister asked the teacher why wasn't with me. She told her that she wanted to give everyone the chance to do the project with someone they hadn't worked with before.\n\nMy stepsister went home and complained to her mom. Then her mom complained to my dad. Then they both complained to the teacher and lied and told her that both my stepsister and I had complained to them. The teacher was like I thought Unhappy didn't want to be paired with stepsister and it became a fight between them.\n\nThen my dad asked me what the hell I had done. He said I knew my stepsister would want to be with me and I went out of my way to be with anyone else. He said she only wants to have some time with me and working together would have been a great bonding experience for us since I have never put much focus on bonding with her.\n\nThey think I'm a dick now and my stepsister was upset. She heard my dad and her mom yelling about it and she was hurt I didn't want to be paired with her.\n\nThe reason I didn't want to pair with her is I did not want to spend all that time with her on the project. She's always trying to cling on to me and I don't like it. I don't dislike her but I'm not interested in being her friend or anything either.

If you do have that talk also with your parents let them know that you are not at all obligated to be friends with your step sister, especially not at both your ages. Preemptively state that you don't ever want to hurt her feelings. Say that you want to be cordial and get along, but thats about where it ends.

Quite frankly, your sister sounds pretty annoying. \n\nSchool projects often result in students being paired with different students\u2026not just working with the same one every time.

And the mere fact that your parents went to teacher over this shows there is an unhealthy dynamic of trying to push others to do what your step sister wants. In my kids' school, they deliberately separate twins into different classes, so the kids would form their own social ties and not get glued together.", "NTA and sounds like your stepsister has a little crush on you.

You didn't go out and pick her like your dad did her mother. Bonding with her was never your aim and it shouldn't be forced on you.", "NTA - you deserve some space. Too much time together can be not great too. \n\nMy cousin and I went to the same school in the same year. Then my Gramma would watch us both after school.

It seems that you're trying to establish some boundaries with your step-sister, and there is nothing wrong with that.  Seems parents are trying to push you two at each other.  That's not fair to your step-sister either because she shouldn't be living in your shadow. Sounds like you two have different interests and personalities, and your parents need to find things for your sister to engage in that spark her interest and help her develop social skills.

Great job being proactive for yourself.

Something like  \"hey, it's nothing against you, but I'd like to be partners with someone else so my social circle doesn't get too narrow.

Instead of saying you gotta love your stepsister because we\u2019re a family, imagine if OP came back with \u201cnone of this would be an issue if you loved mom like you were supposed to\u201d. There is some irony in two people coming from failed relationships forcing their relationship ideals onto their kids.", "The greasy wheel probably doesn\u2019t need more oil, but the squeaky wheel does.", "Bingo", "Ha. Ha. My bad. Yes I meant \u201csqueaky.\u201d", "NTA at all\n\nThis reasonable for you, but more to the point it's also not atypical for a teenager in any way. \n\nTheir reaction is ridiculous. Even if you weren't justified, it's not something that would warrant yelling and freaking out.", "NTA however talk with your dad and let him know that you think your stepsister has a crush on you. Ugh. That is such an awkward situation.", "this had the potential to be a great opening scene for a corno movie lmfao", "NTA can you talk to the school about being in different classes?", "NTA", "I think you have a good point for not wanting to work together with your stepsister, you just went about it in the wrong way. You have put your teacher in an awkward position, when you should have talked to your stepsister or dad directly. NTA, but next time, be honest.", "NTA you have the right not to have your education damaged by a forced relationship. Getting ypu and step sis to bond is NOT what school is for. Go to the teacher and apologize for your lying parental figures. Ask the teacher to help advocate for you with all your other teachers so you never have to work together. Tell them about the bullying from your parent and refer to the clingyness as creepy and boundary crossing. Also, talk to your guidance counsellor and request NOT to be in classes with her if possible in the future.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t force people to have a relationship, even a friendship.\n\nAnd yes, that rejection can hurt - but it\u2019s from wanting something she can\u2019t have, not because you did anything to her.", "NTA and it's bizarre you and a family member are even in the same class (unless this is a small school/program) let alone that a teacher would ever pair two students who live together up (which would give an unfair advantage).\n\nYour parents have problems. School should be for academics. You already see this person enough at home.", "NTA\n\nAnd you are siblings, however new and however much you're still working out the details.\n\nYou need the chance not to be stuck with each other all the time.\n\nThe parents are thinking about you being kind and supportive to the SS, not about both of you having the opportunity to spend time with other people, for her to make othe friends, etc", "NTA. Why are step siblings so DAMN CLINGY? And why do \"blended\" families expect their homelife to be one long episode of the Brady Bunch?", "Good golly.  Why are your stepsister's feelings so important compared to yours?  You LIVE together.  Surely that's enough time together.\n\nI have twins, and I remember once a teacher double checked with me about them being together in some kind of group.  The teacher wanted to make sure they would be ok with it.  Luckily my two are close, and were fine with it.  But they are twins.  You are stepsiblings, and it's to be expected there is a good probability you may have issues that interfere with you working together.\n\nThere is definitely a golden child thing happening here, and your stepsister is far too attached to you.  She needs to develop her own social circle, and your parents need to stop encouraging her to hang on to you.\n\nMy twins are close but they don't do everything together.", "NTA- what is wrong with your parents? Why do they think it\u2019s ok to contact your teacher like that? YOU are most definitely not the asshole. Your parents shouldn\u2019t be inserting themselves in your school life like that and need to learn some serious boundaries.", "NTA\n\nThat your respective parents chose to have a relationship doesn't mean that you kids need to have one. They can hope you get along, but can't demand it or force it.", "YTA - why is it so hard for people to be nice?", "Nta. THEY LIED. \"Then my dad asked me what the hell I had done.\" THEY LIED.   Its not abt what you did. Their marriage does not mean you automatically become family & even if you did, what siblings would choose to pair up? And its not your job to entertain, coddle or partner up w her. Your responsibility is to be nice/civil. The worst part is that they heard her & how she felt. They did not ask you how you felt abt it. Even when they realized it was an issue, instead of accepting your choice, respecting your boundaries, they just lied to get her what she wanted regardless how you feel. They really think this is going to make you want to spend time, quite the opposite!!! Some terrible parenting & your dad sucks for not caring how you feel, not even considering how this would impact you & for lying abt you in the 1st place!! Personally, i would show him the thread just so maybe he can open his eyes. This type of behavior has a tendency to ruin relationships. I highly doubt this would even be an issue if it was you wanting to pair up & ss not wanting to", "NTA I have never been to a school that tries to pair up siblings, rather the opposite to \"force\" the siblings to interact with other students.", "Nta, but uhhhh. I think your stepsister might be crushing on you and that is an entirely different problem. Please don\u2019t be alone with her, and express your discomfort to your father and other trusted adult family members so if she gets upset and accuses you of being inappropriate later there\u2019s a clear record of rebuffing her and your stated discomfort", "I don't understand with your parents, why step sister not being paired to you worth complaints to the teacher, it's not a big deal.", "NTA. You didn't choose your stepmother or your stepsister, so you're under no obligation to spend time with them or have a deep relationship with them. Not even if they want it. \n\nIt was wrong of them to lie to the teacher about you also being upset, because it shows they feel comfortable steamrolling over your desires and emotions.", "I mean\u2026 kinda?? Like not really\u2026 but like did you hate it that bad to ask the teacher specifically. Like I get if you don\u2019t want a relationship as a sibling but like she is still your classmate and you didn\u2019t complain about her not pulling her weight or being lazy. Like you don\u2019t have to be super close to do a project together you instead just have a convenient meeting place to do said project. Also I mean sometimes it happens but teachers have this thing where they like to pair up people who don\u2019t know each other well so you probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten paired up anyway. I\u2019m not saying you are an AH I just think you went too far out of your way for something that was probably not going to happen and shouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal based on your stance.", "Nta and your parents are acting like children. You found a solution that meant nobody needed to get hurt, and they went and kicked up a fuss. Your stepsister wouldn\u2019t have been hurt about you not wanting to pair with her if your parents hadn\u2019t complained to the teacher.\n\nI know a lot of people will say you should\u2019ve told her directly, but I don\u2019t see that going well seeing as your parents aren\u2019t respecting your boundaries at all. Your parents are wrong to force you to be friends with her if you don\u2019t want to be, you\u2019re old enough to decide and you seem to be dealing with this all very maturely anyway. Sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA - your step sister can spend time with you outside of school.", "They don't care about OP's happiness at all. Stepmother only cares about her daughter getting whatever she wants, and Father only cares about keeping Stepmother happy so she'll have sex with him.", "I\u2019m sorry WTF like did op comment this or did you read WAY too much into clinging", "We don\u2019t have full context of the situation he may not accept his new family and may not like them (hence using the word civil) it\u2019s not that easy to just \u201cbe friends with\u201d someone who suddenly invaded your life. Also I heard from a different comment that she has made romantic advances on him that made him uncomfortable so\u2026 that\u2019s a thing", "Asking the teacher did seem a little out of the way especially when usually teachers don\u2019t pair up siblings, I mean G teacher anyway for how they initially lied for him some teachers can\u2019t read between the lines and just would have told the sister the truth and then drama would have happened within the school", "[removed]", "Reading OP's comments it isn't that she's lacking social skills, it's that her mom has raised her to be an entitled brat.", "She said her stepsister is clingy, whiny, and prone to guilt trips. That's a personality clash right there. It drives some people crazy never to be given space to think or be alone or socialize with more than that one clingy person.\n\nBlack people just jump into \"ok, my relative married yours and I have no reason to outright hate you, so we are now instantly Close Loving Sisters and I must do everything with you all the time?\" Really? \n\nSomehow I think that's a matter of personality, not skin color, and there are people of all ethnicities who need a bit of space even from bio siblings every now and then.
