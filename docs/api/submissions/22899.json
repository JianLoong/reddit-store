No. 10.is plenty old enough to learn that wanting a thing isn't reason enough to get a thing you want.", "good grief, this person.. made cookies. how evil ? what is the matter with you ? they just didnt want sisters cookies , maybe they grew used to the taste or even disliked it, maybe they also like baking.. what is the issue with that ?", "I don\u2019t see this as being cute. I think op was well with in her right to make her own cookies.  It was wrong of the parents to take op\u2019s cookies to pacify the baby.\n\n\nNow if op used her sisters stuff then she be wrong. But if I buy the stuff it\u2019s family stuff for everyone. Of my kids buy something special ask before you take it.", "No, I only used the family ingredients.", "I'd bet a dollar they \"made\" OP pay just to shut the 10 year old up and stop the crying.", "This is crazy", "I disagree about the sister being an AH. Cmon she\u2019s 10, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s weird that her parents don\u2019t teach her any boundaries though", "This 100 percent. As long as op didn\u2019t use her stuff she should not have to buy cookies from her sister. \n\nThe parents are teaching little sister how to be entitled and spoiled.", "Yeah.  And this sounds an awful lot like the pattern we see so much where the parents favor one child, that child gets entitled, and things go sideways over time.  NTA", "How does OP suck? \n\nThe parents are telling the little sister that no one is allowed to make cookies besides her, and no one\u2019s allowed to eat cookies they made themself without paying the sister for nothing. OP is just rejecting that idea out loud. That\u2019s totally fair\n\nWhy should OP have to hide evidence that someone else made cookies. That\u2019s insane. \u201cOh she\u2019s 10\u201d and it\u2019s a good time to teach her that life doesn\u2019t go your way because you\u2019re 10.", "If she is a \u201clittle girl\u201d that cries when she doesn\u2019t get her way, is she mature enough to run her own business?", "Kids cry for all kinds of dumb reasons. OP is NTA; the parents had no right to steal his labor.", "Kids will cry because you won't bake them in the oven. Doesn't make you an asshole.", "This is a joke right? Do you have a younger sister? Kids cry at fucking everything-", "Are you really saying that people with 10 year old sisters are never allowed to make themselves cookies or they're an antagonist?", "OP says family ingredients l, so OP didn't buy the ingredients.  Only her sister buys her own ingredients, and OP didn't use those so it's asinine that she can't make something that her sister sells.  Only one person can bake?", "I disagree.\n\nSetting them out in public on a communal plate communicates \"I don't want to participate in these shenanigans, and anyone who agrees can take from this plate for free.\"\n\nWhile the parents crossed a minor line by combining OP's efforts and also making her pay for them, I don't think the little sister's reaction was inappropriate. OP may not have intended to, but they directly stomped on her fun.", "She\u2019s 10", "Could make them with and did make them with are two different sentences", ">I'm guessing there not \"family ingredients\" as makes no sense why mum would buy them if she was getting everyone to buy them off little sister\n\nIt absolutely does make sense. You can do much more with flour, eggs, milk and butter than just cookies.", "They\u2019re actually being really careful to skirt round the issue, but they had both made cookies as they were in the box together. And there\u2019s no mention of the sister baking biscuits afterwards. \n\nIt\u2019s a little bit obfuscation designed to present the OP in the best possible light.", "\u2018I didn\u2019t want her cookies\u2019 implies they were already made and they did both make cookies as they were in the box together. Not sure why the little sister would bake more cookies when she\u2019d already been given some to sell either. Interesting that the OP chose to obfuscate on that point which makes her look better\u2026", "\u2018I didn\u2019t want hers\u2019 implies that they were already made. They did both bake cookies, they were in the box together. The OP skirts around the issue.\n\nThis whole thing is total low level teen girl bitchery whoever made them first. If you were genuinely not doing it without snarkiness, you\u2019d at least pre-warn your sister so she didn\u2019t waste her time spending money on ingredients for cookies that would go to waste when the sister was going to make some free.\n\nHonestly this is all very *innocent face*. It was blatantly passive aggressive.", "I think that bridge has been crossed already.", "Oh sorry\u2026I read that wrong. Partly=party in my mind. \n\nStill NTA\n\nIs OP supposed to pay her little sister every time she wants cookies? What if OP likes baking and sees a recipe online she wants to try out? Is she not allowed to bake cookies anymore because her sister is trying to sell some? OP didn\u2019t use any of the ingredients Anna purchased and she has the right to use the kitchen and make stuff as much as her sister does.", "This is the best answer IMO!", "Thanks for sharing your opinion with me.", "You should be allowed to make your own cookies, this is insane to me! You used household ingredients and didn't touch anything of hers.", "Don't negotiate with ingredients terrorists OP. You were well within your rights to make your own goddamn cookies. Your parents are wack-a-doodle. The thing to do is communicate that this is pretty unfair, and they're clearly making you a bit estranged in your own home. You're a member of the family too, so you should be accepted and treated as such. Sorry you currently aren't.", "You see it too, huh?", "Wait until little sister get married and she tries to charge her spouse for cooking dinner!", "They\u2019re teaching her how to corner the market, lobby governing bodies to ignore your monopoly and exploit free labor. I know it\u2019s a shitty situation, but it is pretty funny how this somewhat spoiled child is acting out capitalism pretty accurately.", "Especially spoiled little kids", "My niece had a full blown meltdown because she was tired. At bedtime. In bed.\n\nShe also cried because she started pooping again when she thought she was done.", "Politely bowing out from his sisters activity of baking and doing it himself is not stomping on her fun. Would you have preferred he ate them all in a hurry to hide his shame? Or like... accept that setting out cookies he made on a plate means nothing and is just a plate of cookies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI can get behind you if OP had made a little sign that said something like \"Free cookies\" but they didn't. It's just cookies on a plate, not someones head in a box to send a message. If the sister has a hobby of sewing clothes for family members and OP buys clothes for his family from a store, is that stomping on her fun too? Is he not allowed to do things without it being compared to/at the expense of his sister?", "And OP has clarified what they meant already, even though it was painfully obvious, because of low-IQ comments like yours.", "IDK, it really does sound like OP wanted to not only eat cookies, but bake them and eat cookie dough? In which case it makes sense for her to bake some herself, and to not buy any from her sister.", "OP made a batch of cookies and ate most of them, what's the issue ? Sister didnt make the existing batch knowing OP was going to want them ? They just make them to sell to anyone.", "OP made cookies for them to eat not to give any away??? They shouldn't have to pay for cookies when they could easily make their own.", "You\u2019re the sister aren\u2019t you", "Yup!\n\nThere's two types of people in the World of Business, sheep and sharks.\n\nSounds like your sister is a shark!\n\nNow you have to ask yourself my friend, which are you?", "This comment is perfect", "r/kidsarefuckingstupid is my primary form of birth control.", "That's how it's going to appear to a ten year old. The parents didn't help here, but the sister isn't at fault.\n\nPolite would have been talking to her about it and trying to include her, even if you don't want to buy cookies from her. If *any* attempt at including her was made, I would call only the parents AHs, but I'm including OP here because there was such an easy and better path to take had she considered her sister's feelings in the matter.\n\nMaybe the same thing would've happened--maybe her sister would've been stubborn and said something like \"no the baking business is ALL MINE,\" but she didn't get a chance at all.", "It\u2019s been a long time since I saw 10."]}
