He hates his job, is having a difficult time trying to see his son, and a lot of debt has stacked up form reckless spending trying to make him feel better. \nWe recently started to combine financials as well as having separate ones. This was done so i could manage our money and pull us out of debt again. This has been working great till the other night. \nMy husband and I where at my moms for dinner and as when started to pack up to leave he asked if we could get Dairy Queen. \nI asked him if he had money for Dairy Queen. I will add the only reason I asked is because each time we get payed we both take out spending money. On this pay cycle he took 200$ and I took 40$. Well he didn\u2019t have money for ice cream and I didn\u2019t want to spend the house hold money because it was going to dip into bills. My mom gave us 10$ and we went on our way. \nIn the car he \u201cdecided\u201d he didn\u2019t want ice cream and we ended up getting popsicles at the store later. I thought all was good til last night. \n\nHe stated that I not only embarrassed him in front of my mom but that I was being financially abusive and he would no longer let me handle the money and I would have to give him an itemized list of bills if I wanted money to pay them. I apologize for embarrassing him and said my intention was not to abuse him but to help him think about his spending habits. I pointed out he took 200$ for spending money and I had 40$. I still have 32$ and he already went through 200$. He said most of that went to paying people back for money he had borrowed so it doesn\u2019t count. \n\nWe still haven\u2019t came to a new plan on how to handle money and I\u2019m thinking about saying at my moms tonight so he has time to think. I hope he is just overwhelmed with life and not realizing he upset in general. \nSo, am I the asshole for asking my husband if he had money for ice cream?\n\nUpdates to add\nFirst, I want to say thank you to everybody commenting on this it\u2019s really helping me figure out how to deal with the situation better. \nA few things I would like to add both my husband and I work full-time but my husband hasn\u2019t made it to a full week of work in months he typically misses half to three days every week so we\u2019re pretty even on the money we\u2019re bringing into the household right now. \nI would also like to add that I am autistic and so is my mother so I often miss social cues and I have realized and I did apologize to him and then originally came up and then it was wrong of me to say that in front of my mom sometimes I just don\u2019t know until I fuck it up that I did something wrong because I suck at peopling.\nThe last thing I would like to add and I don\u2019t mean to sound petty by this we have already spent 100$ oh no ice cream for this month. He has an addictive personality and we\u2019ve been working on that so I know a couple of bucks doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, but when a quarter of a grocery budget if not more goes the ice cream I was expecting him to use his own personal spending money that was given to him at payday when we divided it.\n\nIf you guys have any more questions, feel free to ask.", "created_utc": 1692383242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15usaik/aita_for_asking_my_husband_if_he_has_money_for/", "score": 1766, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like part of the reason he's in this situation, is because he runs out of money. So what's going to happen when he doesn't have money to pay the invoice? The fact that he wanted to pull from the bills money for ice cream is very problematic.\n\nI think there is more space to work together on what shared finances look like. If he doesn't know what bills are coming in or being paid, that is understandable why he would be on edge. You two should be working together.

Most of it nowadays uses a very cheap emulsifier called carrageenan, which is a chemical derivative from seaweed.

Most likely because seaweed is something that's not as foreign overall to those diets. Almost the same concept as what causes allergies (a foreign protein the body just doesn't quite know how to deal with, in very rudimentary layman's terms lol).\n\nBut it's a little fucked up because I used to drink and eat all kinds of stuff that had it in there when I was younger (flavored liquid coffee creamers, ice creams, some half-and-halfs, and also many premade chocolate milks. But then, I hit my 30's, and was drinking a lot of that Fairlife dark chocolate \"uber filtered\" milk when I worked a job where the owner loved the stuff. It tasted great, but then all of a sudden I started feeling like my sister always gotten when she eats dairy...due to lactose intolerance.\n\nTook a little bit of digging into why I was feeling this way, then found some stuff on carrageenan. Noted the symptoms...then noted *all* the different things I consumed that now used it. But I honestly was thinking maybe I was becoming lactose intolerant myself. As a cheese and dairy lover, this was heartbreaking.\n\nFound out my local store brand of Half and Half uses soy lecithin (soy being not exactly a stranger to the Western diet) and didn't feel like shit (and get the shits)occasionally for days after ingesting it. Same with Land O'Lakes brand (though I know they've changed that formula to use carrageenan at least in some areas). Also found one of the big ice cream companies didn't use it (maybe Edy's or Breyers?) and that also I felt fine after eating.\n\nIn the end though as far as ice cream, I discovered the Turkey Hill all natural stuff (comes with a black trimmed lid), and it is the creamiest, most simple and delicious ice cream I've ever had. No emulsifier at all.\n\nSeriously, anyone having some discomfort downstairs after eating or drinking the kind of stuff above should check and see if carrageenan might be the culprit. That's my PSA, at least.\n\nNow to go get myself a bowl of that banging all-natural mint chocolate chip. \ud83d\ude0b", "She\u2019s looking for clarification, not justification.", "Maybe he\u2019s just reckless and irresponsible.", "You have been very invested in a bread you don\u2019t believe to be true.

He got five times more spending money than she did. He has already spent all his spending money and can\u2019t afford ice cream."]}
