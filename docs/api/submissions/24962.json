He hates his job, is having a difficult time trying to see his son, and a lot of debt has stacked up form reckless spending trying to make him feel better. \nWe recently started to combine financials as well as having separate ones. This was done so i could manage our money and pull us out of debt again. This has been working great till the other night. \nMy husband and I where at my moms for dinner and as when started to pack up to leave he asked if we could get Dairy Queen. \nI asked him if he had money for Dairy Queen. I will add the only reason I asked is because each time we get payed we both take out spending money. On this pay cycle he took 200$ and I took 40$. Well he didn\u2019t have money for ice cream and I didn\u2019t want to spend the house hold money because it was going to dip into bills. My mom gave us 10$ and we went on our way. \nIn the car he \u201cdecided\u201d he didn\u2019t want ice cream and we ended up getting popsicles at the store later. I thought all was good til last night. \n\nHe stated that I not only embarrassed him in front of my mom but that I was being financially abusive and he would no longer let me handle the money and I would have to give him an itemized list of bills if I wanted money to pay them. I apologize for embarrassing him and said my intention was not to abuse him but to help him think about his spending habits. I pointed out he took 200$ for spending money and I had 40$. I still have 32$ and he already went through 200$. He said most of that went to paying people back for money he had borrowed so it doesn\u2019t count. \n\nWe still haven\u2019t came to a new plan on how to handle money and I\u2019m thinking about saying at my moms tonight so he has time to think. I hope he is just overwhelmed with life and not realizing he upset in general. \nSo, am I the asshole for asking my husband if he had money for ice cream?\n\nUpdates to add\nFirst, I want to say thank you to everybody commenting on this it\u2019s really helping me figure out how to deal with the situation better. \nA few things I would like to add both my husband and I work full-time but my husband hasn\u2019t made it to a full week of work in months he typically misses half to three days every week so we\u2019re pretty even on the money we\u2019re bringing into the household right now. \nI would also like to add that I am autistic and so is my mother so I often miss social cues and I have realized and I did apologize to him and then originally came up and then it was wrong of me to say that in front of my mom sometimes I just don\u2019t know until I fuck it up that I did something wrong because I suck at peopling.\nThe last thing I would like to add and I don\u2019t mean to sound petty by this we have already spent 100$ oh no ice cream for this month. He has an addictive personality and we\u2019ve been working on that so I know a couple of bucks doesn\u2019t seem like a lot, but when a quarter of a grocery budget if not more goes the ice cream I was expecting him to use his own personal spending money that was given to him at payday when we divided it.\n\nIf you guys have any more questions, feel free to ask.", "created_utc": 1692383242, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15usaik/aita_for_asking_my_husband_if_he_has_money_for/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like part of the reason he's in this situation, is because he runs out of money. So what's going to happen when he doesn't have money to pay the invoice? The fact that he wanted to pull from the bills money for ice cream is very problematic.\n\nI think there is more space to work together on what shared finances look like. If he doesn't know what bills are coming in or being paid, that is understandable why he would be on edge. You two should be working together.

OP said the money goes into a shared account and then they are each free to take spending money. Just because she only took $40 and he took $200 doesn't mean he makes 5x more. Her edit says that they bring in about equal. He misses two to three days every week because he hates his job, which means he'd bring in maybe double if he actually ever worked a full week. Even him potentially earning double doesn't matter since he spends recklessly and continually puts them into debt. The whole point of them combining finances was so that she could contribute to helping him pay off the debt.", "OP  said theoretical he could make more money if he cared to go to work.

He probably got more because he had people to pay off or since she is a reasonable spender she knew she didn\u2019t need $200 and only needed $40. Why pull money out if you don\u2019t need it? Not sure but nothing indicates she doesn\u2019t have income. If anything, it\u2019s quite the opposite.", "How does her working full time between 2 jobs and him working 3 days a week and making the same money not make sense? Jobs pay different amounts?

I'm not saying that as a judgment, just trying to get you to reflect on why you've gone full-tilt in the comments accusing OP of lying and making up a bunch of claims based on...nothing. \n\nThat's why I am asking if you are okay.", "I don\u2019t think she abused that power.
