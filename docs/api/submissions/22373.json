I wouldn't like that sticker either, but most people probably wouldn't even notice.  \n\nAnd it's bf's property.  Would you be okay with him tossing anything of yours he doesn't like, instead of either talking to you about it or letting it go?  If not, then you know you're in the wrong here.", "YTA. That was his property so you should\u2019ve talked to him first", "YTA\n\nHow ridiculously controlling of you to unilaterally remove the sticker, I would be furious. Who do you think you are to decide what is allowed for another adult???? \n\nAnd I'm assuming you didn't remove it in such a way that he can reuse it later. Removing a sticker usually damages it such that it can't be reused.", "YTA you dont know the struggles of being born to shit and forced to wipe", "YTA. If it bothers you so much you ASK him if he would take it off or cover it for your sensibilities. You don't alter someone else's property.", "YTA : You should have talked to him about it. Instead you took it upon yourself to deface his property and destroy a gift from a friend.", "YTA, who cares about the appearance of someone else\u2019s luggage? No one is paying that level of attention to the appearance of your traveling companion\u2019s suitcase, I promise. And if you\u2019re checking the luggage it might not be a bad identification tactic, lol", "YTA. Sounds like he's a guy with a certain sense of humor that you don't appreciate. Something to think about in terms of compatibility. \n\nThat said, the airport will bring out the worst in anyone.", "YTA don\u2019t touch peoples shit and definitely don\u2019t take stickers off of peoples belongings -you don\u2019t know how much that probably meant to him. A couple years ago a friend died of an overdose and we made stickers of his favorite sayings some are rather raunchy but I\u2019d fucking kill if someone took that sticker off of where I put it. Even if it doesn\u2019t have that kind of significance it\u2019s not your place and if it embarrasses you so much maybe he\u2019s not the dude for you or you need to get over yourself", "YTA, you vandalized his property without asking because you felt embarrassed. He'd be smart to dump you because you have no boundaries or respect for others and their property.", "YTA \n\nThe sticker sounds ick. But it wasn\u2019t yours to remove. If he doesn\u2019t like something of yours, does he get to just remove it from your life? Of course not.", "YTA \u2026 why couldn\u2019t you have an actual conversation with him about how you felt?", "What in the world were you thinking?!  \n\nI have this extremely obnoxious inflatable mustache that my friend gave me years ago. It\u2019s absolutely hideous. Which was the point \n\nHe died a couple years ago and it\u2019s basically the only little token I have from the time we were friends.\n\nIf someone was like \u2018this is embarrassing and hideous, better destroy it so I don\u2019t have to look at it\u2019 \n\nI would lose my fucking shit. \n\nYTA", "Of course YTA. And you'd still be the asshole if you'd told him before you did it. Don't take other people's shit, even if it's a shitty sticker. You don't know what it means to him, and your embarrassment isn't his problem. Beyond the inevitable breakup because you clearly don't respect him or his things, I guess.", "YTA.  You vandalized your BF's property, demonstrated how little respect you have for him and his things, and showed him that you would rather go behind his back than talk about things.  On the plus side he now knows exactly the kind of person you are.", "YTA for not talking to him about it and instead defacing his property. It makes me wonder if you chose to act Vs talk because you had an inclination that he wouldn\u2019t remove the sticker\u2026..", "Dude it's just a sticker. YTA", "Yup, YTA. I wouldn't get very mad at you but you can be sure if you did this to me, your whole suitcase would be covered with much worse stickers for that. (Yes, I'm AH too sometimes and I'm well aware of that).", "YTA. Your sense of what is weird is way off lmao. Pretty sure this is a full metal jacket reference. Touch base with reality bro.", "YTA\n\nNo matter how many times we say it, we still keep seeing these posts.\n\n*IF IT IS NOT YOUR PROPERTY, LEAVE IT ALONE. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DISPOSE OF IT*\n\nLike c\u2019mon now, this is kindergarten stuff here.\n\nTime to put on your big girl pants and be an adult. Next time you encounter something you have a problem with, *TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT LIKE AN ADULT*. Don\u2019t go behind his back and destroy his property.\n\nSheesh", "YTA and ridiculous", "How about he goes through your belongs and destroys anything he doesn\u2019t like or that he decides is embarrassing? No? Why not? This is the standard you\u2019ve set. YTA", "YTA", "YTA, aside from it not being your property I am guessing your bf's bag is a common colour and he uses that sticker as a point of difference so he knows which bag is his.", "I want that sticker. Yta", "YTA!", "If i did that id say AH cause that sticker is funny as shit", "YTA are you serious? Don\u2019t touch things that aren\u2019t yours.", "YTA, not your property", "YTA leave his stuff alone", "\u201cI fucked around with somebody else\u2019s stuff, without their consent, because I didn\u2019t like it. AITA?\u201d\n\nYTA and you already know it.", "YTA. Don't touch his shit without permission. It was his luggage, his embarrassment. Maybe you need to figure out how to lighten up and stop worrying about what others think.", "YTA\n\n>I told him it\u2019s because it would be really embarrassing to be seen with that on a suitcase\n\nSo you're worried what random strangers at the airport might think,  but not worried that you upset your boyfriend? Someone you allegedly care about?\n\nI'll never understand the asinine thought process behind \"but what will people think!\"", "YTA. You don't deserve him. He deserves someone who isn't so nitpicky about small stuff and has the same sense of humor as him.\n\nSeriously, they aren't gonna deport you because of the sticker. Strangers will look once, and forget literally 5 minutes later. Tho, I don't think any stranger would even bother looking at all.\n\nI have no clue how what your BF sees in you. I'd hate to be around someone who thinks the world revolve around them. I hope the poor dude leaves your entitled ass.\n\nEdit: Just saw that the sticker was from a friend. It makes you more of an asshole. The sticker may have sentimental value for him.", "YTA\n\nIt wasn't yours. There's nothing wrong with the joke on it either. It's just some absurd, inoffensive, SFW humour that almost anyone who can read would get a little chuckle out of. You sound uptight and controlling. Maybe take the stick out of your ass and realize that the earth revolves around the sun, not you.", "YTA. Not your suitcase, not your call.", "YTA - it wasn\u2019t your property to dispose of\u2026 especially without asking him or talking to him first\u2026 it\u2019s sad something so stupid can make you feel embarrassed\u2026 you owe him an apology.", "YTA\n\nDon't deface his property. Also, that is a very noticeable and identifiable way to find his suitcase easily.", "YTA.\n\nI'd be embarrassed to be dating someone as humorless as you.", "YTA\n\nIts not your.property you shouldnt touch it\n\nBut more importantly pulling the sticker off doesnt change your bf's personality,.he is still the doofus whom thought that it was cute/funny.  That is a much bigger issue.", "YTA", "It was his property. You should have spoken to him about it. Have a conversation. YTA", "My bf and I share a sense of humor but he also finds more crude humor entertaining than me at our ages.  I asked him last night if he wanted to start a clan on a game we play to put our characters in and he said sure... it was his account so he chose the clan name.  This dude chose a variation of \"lick my ball sack\" spelled the special way gamers do.  I fully accepted it even as I told him it was dumb lol.  Point being, you had no right to deface your bf's property like that.  AH.", "Yta.\n\nImagine if he decided one day he didnt like the shirt you were wearing and decided to rip it off you without your consent.", "YTA \n\n*AITA for being a controlling girlfriend who throws away gifts he gets from his friends because I am embarrassed to be seen around them?*\n\nYes you are, you walking red flag", "Hahahahaha. Terrible taste sticker is funny because it's dumb honestly. YTA. You're also boring", "YTA Who's even offended by such a sticker?\nYou sound like a stick in the mud.\nI doubt your senses of humour match if this is the way you behave.", "ESH \n\nThat sticker is ridiculously juvenile and I would be mortified if my BF had that on his suitcase. \n\nHowever, you can\u2019t touch someone else\u2019s property like this. It\u2019s incredibly disrespectful.", "ESH \nThe sticker in question is beyond juvenile. He's TA for not putting it somewhere more appropriate.\n\nYTA because you made a call and took it off his suitcase. He's not your child. You don't get to make decisive calls on what sorts of stickers are seen by the world...even if they're deeply stupid. I often want to scratch those family stickers off people's cars...but I don't, because that's an entitled level of psycho. Apologise and buy your BF a new stupid sticker that says the same thing.", "NTA. \n\nYou would have to be exceptionally juvenile to think that sticker was funny, or appropriate.", "NTA.
