That sticker was a unique idenfiyer in a sea of cookie cutter suitcases. It was more than just a sticker.", "Are you serious? It's obviously just a silly little sticker meant to be funny. You would question whether he wipes his ass because of a stupid sticker?", "Way to take a joke. It\u2019s a sticker dude. Most people would laugh, not notice, or not care. I guess you\u2019re the exception.", "You are very judgemental and need to stop thinking about other people so much and focus on yourself...", "u/MinimumExperience377 is a bot.", "How do you conclude that someone's a bot?", "Oh, my bad. But you're right, that makes it worse!", "Let\u2019s be honest here, the bf wanted to be an edgelord, let\u2019s not act like the sticker with a skull and the cringiest saying on it had a real purpose\u2026", "If he had a sticker of the Sydney Swans on his suitcase I'd assume he likes football.", "There are literally other people in this thread who agree.", "This is a subreddit dedicated to judgement.", "Tips for spotting bots:\n\n- I'm extra suspicious of the comments in the 3rd position on a thread. Bots seem to love it there.\n\n- comment speaks directly to the OP but is a lower level comment that OP is unlikely to see (as opposed to the original, stolen comment which is top level and will send a notification to OP, so speaking directly to them makes sense)\n\n- comment doesn't logically follow what comes before (because it was plucked at random from further down)\n\n- comment unnecessarily starts with a judgment (because it stole from a top level comment where that was necessary)\n\n- username ends with random letters or a word that is missing the last few letters\n\n- post ends with ellipses for no reason\n\n- account is around a month old and never posted until today. (Update: This is changing.  There are some accounts only 5 days old and some a year old. But having no other comments is the dead giveaway.)\n\n- account made multiple comments in different subreddits/threads within seconds of each other\n\n- post looks like it used a thesaurus and doesn't quite make sense (because it's a rewording bot using a thesaurus! ). Pronouns are often switched and fancy words that don't quite seem to belong are used\n\n- post is nothing but quoted text\n\n- post begins or ends in the middle of a sentence (often ending with a comma instead of a period)\n\n- a bot NEVER has flair (because it never posts top level comments and certainly never has the top top comment) \n\n- The best and last step is to search within the current thread and find the original that was stolen from.  Unless it's a rewording bot or one of the weird ones that copies from a whole other thread or just posts affirmations (eg \"I agree!\" Or \"10/10\" ) you'll find it and know you're right.", "There\u2019s people who don\u2019t like the sticker. I wouldn\u2019t go as far as to say they all agree with you that this person is unhygienic or doesn\u2019t wash his hands or would refuse to sit next to them. It\u2019s a sticker.", "Doesn't change my statement..."]}
