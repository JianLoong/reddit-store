And it\u2019s obvious they sure as heck weren\u2019t thinking you\u2019d take back their gifts since you had already bought them. Return what you can, keep anything you want for yourselves and either donate the rest to a charity or if you know of a family that\u2019s struggling, personally gift them and their kids with the gifts. DO NOT GIVE IN AND GIVE THEM BACK ANY OF THE GIFTS YOU BOUGHT THEM. IF you choose to \u201crelent\u201d on taking away the gifts, go to the dollar store and buy each of them similar stuff they gave you & your GF. If they gripe, tell them you\u2019re only following their gift ideas of how much to spend on each other. But, of course, doing that would mean actually getting back in contact with them. I think you going NC without giving them any gifts at all will have the better impact on them as to how NOT to piss off the person they were hoping to reap high end rewards from. \n\nYour family\u2019s phony ignorance about having \u201cno idea what to get you\u201d doesn\u2019t pan out. You\u2019ve been NC with them in the past and still knew them well enough to get them thoughtful gifts. Nope. And to give your GF a stupid fart spray gift? Granted, they might not know what she\u2019s into but if they couldn\u2019t be bothered to ask you what she liked, they could\u2019ve given her something like a decorative, scented candle or some other nice generic gift that wasn\u2019t a gag. \n\nWhether you choose to go back to NC with them (which it certainly looks like you should as it\u2019s obvious your family was only reconnecting with you for the expensive, thoughtful, gifts you bring) or just LC where you just contact them enough to let them know you\u2019re still alive, it\u2019s your choice. You & your GF can be all the family you need. You can adopt your own family (turn some good friends into part of a family of sorts). Families can be made of just two people who love & respect each other. No one is required to continue being connected to people who are related to them when they don\u2019t treat the people like they should. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that your GF and you have both seemed to have drawn the short stick when it comes to having family that really cares about you two as people, but at least you currently have each other. \n\nI also suggest that you consider getting a will out together sooner rather than later. You and your GF may or may not stay together or you two may become lifelong partners, officially married or not (and don\u2019t invite either sets of relatives to any wedding if you get married, if ever). If you were to be in a life threatening situation, your GF will have no say about your treatment should you be unable to make decisions for yourself, it will be up to your family members to do so. They will also inherit your money and any other assets in your name, shutting your GF out. If you\u2019re not willing to make your GF beneficiary of your assets, pick a charity to end up with it, or bequeath some funds to your SO and the rest however you wish. Make sure whomever you want to be in control of your health related issues knows how you\u2019d like things to be handled (are you a DNR type of person? Would you consider being an organ donor?). \nYour will can always be amended and updated as your family situation changes (get married, have kids, divorce). You are never too young to have a will that will ensure that the people you want to have access to your assets get them instead of the people who the courts will decide on. Courts will choose \u201cofficial\u201d spouses and offspring first, but if the SO has no \u201clegal\u201d ties to the deceased, they will often side with the blood relatives, even if it is just to have the assets put into trust for any minor children. That means OPs family would be the ones setup as trustees to the minors assets and who knows what would happen.", "A joke or prank against someone who doesn't consent is bullying.

The rest of the \"pranks\" were gag gifts? I don't get it. Even if you dislike pranks, none of these really fit the definition, unless you're in elementary school.", "Am going to take the risk of being a fraidy cat, but here are some suggestions:\n\nNow that you've punished the prankster gangsters for their nastiness they may turn uglier than before.\n\nGoing forward, best not TMI abt your vacations/successes on social media - it may only fuel family envy. You say they spied on your social media. \n\nIf you decide ever to have children, warn them about your NC family. Your children will be born with social and financial advantages and your creepy cruel relatives may try to contact them.\n\nGoing forward, if you marry, take security precautions so that your wedding is not pranked by having false cancellations of venues and services. Mention nothing about weddings on social media and hire security in case the schmucks try to gatecrash. \n\nMight also be wise to put their names on a no visitors list any time either you or your partner are in the hospital.  \n\nGood that you and your girlfriend are backing each other up.", "Borrow, rip, return.\n\nI've found some really obscure stuff in library DVD collections in the UK; I clean the disc, image it, then return it ASAP.\n\nBefore torrents were big I managed to get almost the entire output of Jan Svankmajer's stuff that way. His Alice in Wonderland is a masterpiece.\n\nLibraries are fantastic, use them or lose them! And *use your librarian*, it's a profession and they're really good at tracking down exactly what you want even if you aren't sure what that is!", "Quite right too, apart from the box art or whatever you actually own it.\n\nStreaming is all very well and good till you either have no net access or the service loses rights to the content you 'bought'.\n\nI well remember the grotesque irony of Amazon remotely deleting copies of 1984 from people's Kindles, you couldn't make it up.\n\nMy approach is generally to buy the rights to something, then aquire a copy via the high seas to make sure I've got one that won't go away. That way the creators get their (small) slice, and I get a copy that can't be taken away from me.", "Thanks, friend!!", "Good point!", "It feels like they may have reconnected with OP due to OP\u2019s recent financial success. If that\u2019s the case, then they were all monumental idiots to piss off OP before they got the gifts free & clear.", "Plus a spritz of fart spray in each car for good measure. Since they think it's such a nice gift.", ">but I wonder if he actually snatched tablets back out of children's hands\n\nEven IF OP did, so what?  The fallout, as it should be, is on the family members that pulled the pranks.  They'll probably spin it as OP is the Grinch, but in reality THEY are the ones responsible for the disappointed kids and they will be the ones to deal with the emotions involved.  No one else.", "External battery for an iPad to play movies that are downloaded is another good option. Actually, an external battery should be a household requirement. \ud83d\ude02.

So it came in handy.", "I mean just use a regular tablet and pre-download Netflix or other app shows/movies.", "Go upstairs, unload the fat spray in their respective closets, come down and say \"you're right, this IS a funny gag!\"", "OP,  congrats -you finally learned how to prank them back. Aren't they happy? \n\nFrom now you have so many years to make the score even - let them enjoy every upcoming celebration!\n\nYou're family sounds too mean and greedy. Do not enable them. \n\nI'm a petty one, I'd love to send them gorgeously wrapped toilet paper or toothpicks as birthday presents.

You'll stand up for yourself now.", "NTA. \nIt's almost as if they expect to be rewarded for their horrible abhorrent behavior! Return the stuff, and whatever you can't return, sell on eBay! Send them pictures so they can see how that badly they fucked up with you.", "NTA- seems your family has little respect for you since you asked them to be nice but went ahead and acted like a bunch of dicks anyway. Since you have your own house and disposable income to spend on friends and family you deserve some respect. Your heart was in the right place so be proud of your success and leave those who feel entitled to take without any considerations of your effort behind. You look out for you and those who appreciate you.", "No its your right to take back the gifts if they didn't take you seriously. NTA", "NTA in the slightest.

You tried.  You know you went NC for a reason and you gave them the benefit of the doubt that they might have changed.  They have proved they don't deserve your contact or your gifts. \n\nIf they really had no idea what to get you...the answer in this day and age is 'gift cards'.  I'm sure if they even just gave you a $25 Starbucks gift card you would have stayed and let them keep the gifts. They were humiliating you AND your partner.  \n\nAnd it has nothing to do with the dollar amount. You spent time and energy selecting gifts for them they'd like, and you know they deliberately picked these crappy gifts for you (the fart spray? Really?  I could understand if they were poor and dollar store socks were all they could afford, but the fart spray is just over the effing line).", "I don't know how many times I've had to explain that a prank is only funny if the pranked is laughing. NTA.", "NTA.  They don't deserve your generosity.", "Info: Did they all give similar dollar store gifts to each other?", "OP this was hard to read. I'm so so sorry you've been cursed with a \"family\" like this. You know that they're not pranksters, but bullies, right? You did the right thing going NC, and the smart thing is to just cut everything off again- they're not just going to continue treating you like garbage, but any potential life partner. \n\nNTA", "Should have accidentally spilled the fart spray on the way out..", "Mostly NTA but i would not have taken the kid's gifts, it isn't their fault.", "NTA. Gag/prank gifts are good as long as the receiving party's fine with them, same as pranks. You said no pranks/prank gifts. They ignored that. Classic case of FAFO. They had one chance and they blew it. They'd be doing the same thing to any kids you two might have and not really care at all if they stomped right over that boundary now.", "NTA\n\nTime to send them back beautifully wrapped packages containing the crap they gave you.", "NTA you were reminded that your family chooses insensitive and thoughtless approaches to their relationships and it\u2019s best you bid them farewell.", "INFO - did you take the gifts after they opened them?", "NTA", "NTA. They should have known better. They cannot bully you and still expect to be rewarded for their behavior. Notice how there was no apology and just an entitlement to the gifts. Good on you for shutting them down hard. The best gift you gave their children is showing stupid actions have consequences.", "Yes.

I bought them in store at Walmart. I was surprised to know they exist too, because I did not see one until a friend of mine showed me one he got. They're a little oldschool. But they're good for kids because they have the option to either stream or watch a DVD", "Sick Christmas somewhere warm!", "This. It wasn't one prank; it was EVERYONE pulling a prank on OP.
