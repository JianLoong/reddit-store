At 17, your daughter gets to decide which one of you she wants to stay with, anyway. Next year, she may decide not to stay with either of you, either way. It sounds as if your daughter's father has wasted his chances for a good relationship with her, which is a shame, for many reasons.", "At 17, many courts would let her decide where to stay. You may want to remind your ex.", "She literally asked you to help her stay safe and stabilized and you did what any other mother would, said yes. If her dad stresses her out she's allowed to not put up with that no matter what age she is. She's still got agency and her dad needs to understand that his kids aren't \"his\". No one owns their freaking kids, they aren't bargaining chips, and they aren't argument ammo. They're human beings with personalities, and agency, and they have freaking boundaries that ppl MUST respect. \n\nYou did good mom, NTA. If I had kids, I'd rather my kid take her time to feel better than watch her get worse due to stress she could have avoided. I'd remind him he's driving his kid away by being YTA.", "NTA - She's 17; what are you gonna do? Pick her up and throw her in the car? \n\nCould you offer for him to talk to her therapist/doctor - to just say \"Yes, these issues are real and if you keep being a jerk about it it will make things worse for her?\" \n\nAnd then basically, just let your daughter call, text, and see him as she wants. Even offer (if your sanity can stand it) for him to come over once a week for coffee and a chat; but she shouldn't have to basically move houses every week when she can't handle it.", "NTA. Your ex doesn't sound too bright. He's the one who is pushing away your daughter. A little understanding would go a long way, and if he can't offer it, she is better off in a more supportive environment. At 17 years old, it should be her choice.", "NTA. She's 17. At that age kids should be able to decide for themselves.", "NTA. She's 17 and more than old enough to decide", "Your daughter is old enough to make her own decisions regarding this. Nta.", "NTA my parents split when I was a kid, 1 week at moms, 1 week at dads, alternating forever. By the middle of high school I was staying at my moms cause it was closer, and my dads during summer. It's really not a big deal.\n\nYour ex is clearly not a good person for your daughter to be around right now, seeing as he doesn't believe mental health issues are real and will likely just berate her about it if she stays with him.", "NTA\n\nShe's 17 and can make her own decision on this, and right now she needs the stability of only being at one house, mainly the house she feels safe and secure in. Going back and forth like that isn't for every kid, they don't want to do it and want just one home, one bedroom.", "NTA - she made the decision, so it's not like you're forcing her to stay. She is 17 and can make her own decisions and if she feels more comfortable with you then that's a valid feeling and better for her mental health", "Nta. At 17 your daughter is old enough to decide if she wants to go her father's or not. You are right to support your child.", "NTA,\n\nYour ex sounds like a horrible peice of work that ya shouldn't even be letting her near if he's been abusive and  is aggressive from what you've said.\nThe fact he's outright saying her problems don't exist is also a huge red flag, I honestly under why your daughter wants to stay with you I wouldn't want to be in a house with someone like that either. 17 is more than old enough I was 16 when I chose to go into foster care and get away from my mom, the fact he's trying to make decisions that also harm her is insane to me.", "Your kid is 17.  You guys shouldn't be deciding this stuff for her at all anymore. I'm not going to pass a judgement but it seems like everyone is infantilizing this 17 y/o woman.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" AITA for letting my daughter stay with me during his time? I\" ... She is 17. LEt her make her own decissions. \n\nJust keep making shure she has a home with you any and all days, regardless of the custody agreement. Atr 17, her dad can pound sand: He is having the reltionship he built with her for the last 21 years. This is on him.", "NTA\n\nI agree that if she feels more comfortable at your house that's where she should stay\n\nBut for everyone who says \"she's 17, she can make her own decision\" that's not true. At 17 she is still a minor, so if there was indeed a court order, father would be right in fixing the issue. \n\nHe would still be an asshole, though", "NTA.\n\nA 17 year old can't be forced to go to a parent's house. That's just a fact of life. If he went to court, his daughter saying she didn't want to go there would be enough for the judge let her stay with you.\n\nYou probably know how to handle your ex better than most Redditors could.

Unfortunately, he probably doesn't.", "We've never been to court, we have a notarized agreement regarding the custody arrangement. She will be 18 in a few months, at this point (and at the speed courts work here) I feel it would be pointless to drag him to court?", "Thank you for your kind words. I do feel very protective of her (especially after everything that happened), and thought maybe that was clouding my judgement? Bc I don't understand ex's argument that I should just drop her off at his place regardless of what she wants or needs bc \"I am the parent\". For me, being the parent means that I listen to her and respect her feelings (without giving in to her every whim either)", "He has been in contact with her therapist, and since then doubled down on his stance her issues aren't real. I don't know why. I am in contact with the therapist as well, and to me therapist confirmed her issues are very real indeed.\nEx is not allowed in my house (and I don't enter his) due to his verbally agressive and threatening behaviour in the past.", "He's an okay father when there aren't any issues regarding the children. Unfortunately the children have had a bit of a rough ride through life so far, due to issues outside of our and their control, and that's when their father really struggles to understand them/empathize with them.", "I feel the root of his complaint is that I let her make her own decisions while he feels that we as parents should do that. For example, when she was hospitalized he pressured me to shorten her stay there, while she herself wanted to stay until she felt stabler. He was also upset that school and I allowed her to return to school part time after her hospitalization (academic performance is very important to him) and he blames her lower grades on her lower attendance (even if it was in agreement with therapist and school councilor)", "He coukd take her to court, but very, very few courts would force a 17 year old.", "there's no court order, but we do have a notarized agreement regarding custody", "There are no court orders. At the speed the courts work here she would be over 18 by the time the case would even be put on the roll", "No one is suggesting that you take him to court or vice versa. What we\u2019re saying is a custody arrangement that was appropriate for a three year old isn\u2019t appropriate for a 17 year old. She\u2019s months away from being an adult, and no longer subject matter to any court order or agreement. And him belittling and denying her mental health issues are having an impact now, and likely will effect their relationship forever. He\u2019s shooting himself in the foot and blaming you for firing the gun. \n\nYou\u2019re fine. Do nothing.", "I had a mother who actually respected me just as you do your daughter and it has done wonders for me as a human being. I self actualized early and knew who I was growing up and what I stood for. I was able to set boundaries and easily say no because my mother did what you are doing now. \n\nI promise you she will value you beyond what you can even understand because of this one very good decision you made.", "NTA, you absolutely made the right call here, but please be sure to document all of this in case he tries to take you to court. If she doesn't want to go back to his house at all, a restraining order for both of you might be a good next step.\n\nEspecially given his abusive behaviors toward you, I'm concerned that your ex may be abusing your daughter. A teenager asking not to live with a specific parent for their mental health is a huge red flag and sadly, in my experience, the overwhelming majority of teenagers who are hospitalized for mental health reasons are there largely due to the effects of abuse. Of course, she may just be a neurodivergent kid who struggles with change and knows that she'd do better with staying with her more accepting and understanding parent, but I would definitely encourage you to rule out something more serious before leaving her alone with your ex again.", "So... He isn't allowed near you for being aggressive but wonder if you are TA for not letting your kid who's dealing with mental health issues get to stay entire weeks with him when she does NOT want to? Come on, you're taking the right call by supporting your kid plus she's old enough to decide and if he keeps being so mean she may go no contact with him soon", "If he's only okay and reliable when there's nothing major he needs to be relied on for, he's not reliable or an okay father. I applaud you for protecting your daughter from his callousness, she needs it and he's being overtly obtuse and combative. Don't give in here, he doesn't know more than her doctors or mental health professionals.", ">He's an okay father when there aren't any issues\n\nso he's a good dad so long as there's no actual stakes involved where he has to....do anything for the kids?", "From all of your comments, I'd say that your daughter needs to stay away from her father. He sounds like a horrible sort of person, abusive, and medically negligent.", "I don't disagree, was just saying that legally, no she can't make her own decisions yet. \n\nCarry on, everyone", "So, that technically COULD be enforced, but like you said, by the time it got in front of a judge she'd most likely be 18 anyways, which he'll most likely realize", "Thanks so much!", "Thank you, I will definitively keep that in mind", "He's an *okay* dad when there are no stakes. High praise indeed!", "You're more than welcome and I wish you and your girl the best!"]}
