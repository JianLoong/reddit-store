To see your partner literally drowning in the mess of sleep deprivation, surgical recovery, hormonal hell, toddler hell, etc. and willfully not do everything you can to support them is just cruel indifference.\n\nI\u2019ve been where you are with my own spouse, and I gave justifications and excuses just like those you\u2019ve given here. And my husband was/is a nice guy so I wasn\u2019t allowing myself to see how juvenile and fucking selfish he was being. And I was too exhausted and depressed to even imagine dealing with it. I even had a very nice therapist who I was seeing for PPD who flat out told me my husband needed to sack up and contribute (the therapist and his wife had just had their second baby so he could especially appreciate what I was going through). I let this shit slide for a couple years until our marriage essentially imploded (right when COVID hit too, so we literally had no choice but to stay home and deal with our shit lol).\n\nLuckily, that situation forced a lot of these problems to the surface, and it also helped me find my voice. I gained the confidence to finally call out the selfish behavior and hold him accountable, and stopped being afraid of the arguments and push back. We went through a *lot* of therapy as a couple and individuals. Like a lot. We still go. We fought a lot. I had to speak up and push back a lot more than I wanted to (because I wanted to avoid arguments, but knew I needed to stand my ground). Our life was kinda hellish for two years.

I want to say you should each be able to be away for a couple of days without significant issue (though they fact that your daughter was just in NICU would probably put the fear of God into me for like 6 months at least).\n\nBut the fact that you say he has no patience and wouldn't be able to handle it makes me actually worried. I would say you/him concluding \"he wouldn't be able to handle it\" is exactly the reason why you *should* go away for a weekend, but the \"little patience\" comments are just scary.

Now add to that the fact she just had a c section and there's also a newborn. I guarantee you, the mother is severely sleep deprived. Those two hours every day are her only downtime, if even that, because a newborn just can't manage without their mother. \n\nI'd say leaving your family alone to go have fun at a time like this is not unlike mental abuse.

Not sure the age gap matters too much if they attend the same schools at some point, you know? They\u2019re both excited that the youngest gets to go to \u201cbig school\u201d with big brother next year. \n\nFor a bigger age gap, my husband is the oops baby. While they have some serious differences in bonding between the oldest two and him, they are all very close. The oldest two are closer but also aggravate the hell out of each other. My husband is somewhat on the outside while also being everyone\u2019s favorite mediator.\n\nI don\u2019t think the age gaps matter as much as the personalities of the kids and parenting, and there\u2019s no way to know how that shakes out until it happens", "So, I have 6 kids. \n\nThe twins are 19, next bio is almost 14, next bio are 7&5.

The older ones didn\u2019t need so much work when the new baby came. When I had a toddler and a baby, it was pure bullshit. ;) \n\nBut there are downsides to having age gaps, too.

It would be nice to not have littles bc I\u2019m 42 and really would like more naps. ;) But, that\u2019s how my life worked out and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. \n\nDo the age gap if you\u2019re in your 20\u2019s. Don\u2019t do it if you\u2019re any older than 32.\n\nETA: all of my kids are extremely close. I raised them to be that way, though.
