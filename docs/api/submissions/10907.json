You need someone to help take care Of the kids, but also take care of you. He needs to get his priorities in order.", "NTA. 2 hours in the evening is hardly spending time with them at all when he doesn't see them for the other 22 hours of the day. Also, I dont know much about c-sections but I'm sure you're not fully recovered after just 6 weeks. And he wants to leave you (vulnerable from surgery) alone with a toddler and a newborn?? You're definitely not wrong for how you feel about it. He sounds like a clueless, unhelpful, and absent partner...thats putting it nicely. If I were you, I would definitely give him a piece of my mind and possibly even tell him I'll be rethinking the relationship if a stupid bachelor's party is more important than the family he helped create.

OP, you really need to reconsider this marriage", "**NTA**\n\nAnd YIKES! He \"told you\"? He didn't even have a real conversation and ask you how you felt about it, just INFORMED you that he was driving somewhere nine hours away for a weekend and ditching you, 6 weeks post-major surgery with a baby just out of the NICU and a toddler that he hasn't been helping out with in any meaningful way?\n\nClearly you're at your wits' end, my friend, but might I (very gently) suggest that it might be time for a taste of his own medicine? Not in the sense that others are saying with you going away, which you don't even seem ready for, but in the sense of sitting him down and \"telling him\" a few things? Including that: no, he is NOT going away for a Bachelor weekend, because he has family responsibilities; and yes, he is in fact going to be napping a lot less and involving himself a lot more in his children's lives? \n\nIf this is how he wants to communicate, with pronouncements instead of reasonable conversations, then you have every right to give them right back to him. You are NTA.", "NTA. If you haven't already, I'd tell him exactly what you wrote here. Then he's free to make whatever decision he likes. If he still decides to go after you clearly communicated your needs and feelings about the situation, then it's on him completely. I'm a big fan of communicating, and saying exactly what's on your mind.\n\nI'd sit him down when you're both relaxed and say \"You going on this bachelor's party trip doesn't sit right with me. I need you here with me. I know you want to have fun with the guys, but now isn't the right time.

You need to recover and he needs to be home.", "NTA- Definitely NTA - You went through a traumatic experience a mere six weeks ago, had major surgery, are recovering from giving birth, and have two young children in your care.

You need to have a serious talk with him about his lack of participation as a husband and father. At the very least, he should be giving you time to yourself each day to bathe, take a nap, or just relax. It is completely unfair for you to work 24/7 taking care of everything, while he works 8-9 hours and then gets to sleep uninterrupted, while you get up to feed the baby.\n\nYou need time to recover properly from your c-section.

He needs to sort his priorities out.", "NTA. Tell him he needs to prioritize his family over his fun.", "NTA. But seriously, take a bath and other small moments for yourself.

You'll feel so much better.", "NTA. But I\u2019m curious if you have communicated with him that you need help? \nAlso are you saying your husband works 7 days a week and ONLY has time for kids every day for just two hours? What about weekends? \nPerhaps you should plan a getaway the following weekend and tell your husband you\u2019ll be gone.  It\u2019s ok to take a break.

You won't get his help either way.", "NTA, but please take a break. No child ever died from crying too much. Leave the newborn in a safe place with entertainment, leave the toddler watching TV or something. A five minute shower at the least :)", "So this guy wasn't helpful at all with the first one and then you go and have a second? Sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA, perhaps you should go stay with family while he\u2019s away (if he goes), and I would extend that visit a couple of days past his scheduled return.

I'm in urban West Coast, and ours are 40/hour for two kids. \n\nHe's going to spend 1k on a party weekend? You're getting 1k for childcare - and take-out, and the housekeeping service that's coming in to clean the house. \n\nHe wants to party? He can farking well pay for you to not be on duty for three days straight. \n\nLong term? You two need marital counseling like NOW. Actually, you needed it pre-kid two, but oh well... That's passed, move forward. And get a pro in there, because he sure as hell doesn't seem to listen.", "But the issue is not this weekend it\u2019s the rest of the time."]}
