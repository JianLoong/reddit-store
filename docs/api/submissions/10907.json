I think you should re-evaluate staying with him, but if you decide you want to try then at least sit him down and tell him everything you've said here. Maybe show him this thread. \n\nAlso, what nearly happened to your child is **not** irrelevant here because he should have been helping out this whole time to give you a chance to recover too. Your mental state is entirely relevant, and there's no way you're in a good place after a close call.

It'd be highly inappropriate for this man to take off for a bachelor party, with you still recovering and an infant that had such a rough start and absolutely no other help in the household.\n\nIf someone comes to help you, then by all means, let him go.

And I get what you\u2019re *trying* to say about not everyone being great with babies\u2014it doesn\u2019t always come naturally and some people really have to learn, especially if they didn\u2019t grow up around young kids. \n\n*However*, he chose to be in this relationship, and to have children. Even if the kids were unplanned, he chose to engage in sexual activity knowing it was a possibility, stuck around etc. \n\nOnce you become a committed partner and parent, you do *not* get the *luxury* of simply saying you don\u2019t have the patience and aren\u2019t good with babies. Two people made this baby, and both of these people are responsible for dedicating themselves to the care and responsibility that accompanies said baby. In not contributing, he is displaying how little he respects you, your work, your needs, and your kids. He is actively showing you that he prioritizes himself and his wants over the family and his partner. And to be clear, parenting should not be \u201c50/50\u201d and a score keeping game\u2014both parents should be putting 100%. When one parent needs a boost, the other props them up, and vice versa. To see your partner literally drowning in the mess of sleep deprivation, surgical recovery, hormonal hell, toddler hell, etc. and willfully not do everything you can to support them is just cruel indifference.\n\nI\u2019ve been where you are with my own spouse, and I gave justifications and excuses just like those you\u2019ve given here. And my husband was/is a nice guy so I wasn\u2019t allowing myself to see how juvenile and fucking selfish he was being. And I was too exhausted and depressed to even imagine dealing with it. I even had a very nice therapist who I was seeing for PPD who flat out told me my husband needed to sack up and contribute (the therapist and his wife had just had their second baby so he could especially appreciate what I was going through). I let this shit slide for a couple years until our marriage essentially imploded (right when COVID hit too, so we literally had no choice but to stay home and deal with our shit lol).\n\nLuckily, that situation forced a lot of these problems to the surface, and it also helped me find my voice. I gained the confidence to finally call out the selfish behavior and hold him accountable, and stopped being afraid of the arguments and push back. We went through a *lot* of therapy as a couple and individuals. Like a lot. We still go. We fought a lot. I had to speak up and push back a lot more than I wanted to (because I wanted to avoid arguments, but knew I needed to stand my ground). Our life was kinda hellish for two years. BUT, by some miracle, we worked through it. He is like a completely different partner now, and I am too. But he\u2019s gotta want to do the work. \n\nLong anecdote, just simply sharing because if you don\u2019t address this head-on now, it\u2019s going to continue to seep its way into your relationship and lives, and it\u2019s going to eat away at your marriage/family from the inside out.", "You need to educate yourself and do some better reading.\n\nShe should be able to drive at 2 weeks.

It doesn't matter whether or not she's leaving them with her husband, she's not leaving her baby.", "Um no. A c-section AT BEST is an 8 week healing period because it is major abdominal surgery!
