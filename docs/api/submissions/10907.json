To see your partner literally drowning in the mess of sleep deprivation, surgical recovery, hormonal hell, toddler hell, etc. and willfully not do everything you can to support them is just cruel indifference.\n\nI\u2019ve been where you are with my own spouse, and I gave justifications and excuses just like those you\u2019ve given here. And my husband was/is a nice guy so I wasn\u2019t allowing myself to see how juvenile and fucking selfish he was being. And I was too exhausted and depressed to even imagine dealing with it. I even had a very nice therapist who I was seeing for PPD who flat out told me my husband needed to sack up and contribute (the therapist and his wife had just had their second baby so he could especially appreciate what I was going through). I let this shit slide for a couple years until our marriage essentially imploded (right when COVID hit too, so we literally had no choice but to stay home and deal with our shit lol).\n\nLuckily, that situation forced a lot of these problems to the surface, and it also helped me find my voice. I gained the confidence to finally call out the selfish behavior and hold him accountable, and stopped being afraid of the arguments and push back. We went through a *lot* of therapy as a couple and individuals. Like a lot. We still go. We fought a lot. I had to speak up and push back a lot more than I wanted to (because I wanted to avoid arguments, but knew I needed to stand my ground). Our life was kinda hellish for two years.

I loved him very much, but I resented him a lot, too, while we were growing up. He started 1st grade the year before I entered Junior High School.

I got along brilliantly with all of them, never once had a falling out, people used to comment on how well we got along and how lucky my mum was. the 10 year gap brother was my best friend I'd babysit him in a heart beat when he was a kid and I'd talk to him about anything, still will. The 2 younger ones we got along fine but I never lived with them and after my dad divorced their mum I don't really see them other than for my nieces and nephews birthdays.

We had very different personalities. I was a very reserved and quiet kid and little sis was extremely active and impulsive. Later, it was found that I was autistic and sis had ADHD, which explains a lot. Even so, we were pretty close, since we had similar interests (both of us were tomboys that liked anime and videogames), and despite our opposite personalities, it worked out. It was like she encouraged me to be more adventurous and I encouraged her to be more calm. As adults, we got along better since the age gap stopped being significant.", "Totally agree.

She literally tells you he does them the moment he comes home and does them untill he goes back to sleep. That's the 10% he can give as there literally is not more to give other than also his time to sleep.\n\nHis decision in this very moment is extremely awfull. I mean, who in their right mind would leave their loving wife in this situation? And then it clicked. This man is not in his right mind. Then it clicked again. Of course he isn't as he hasn't had a single moment of rest in years. He's been a credit card and rest giver for years while not receiving anything. \n\nAnd then it really clicked. This relationship was doomed years ago as both have started to think of themselves and not as a unit. He's an absolute freaking AH for this action. But her reasoning is \"I deserve it and he doesn't\" and that makes her the AH as well in my eyes. So on the question itself she's the AH, in life they've both become the AH towards each other.\n\nYou need to also think, she's writing this in her best advantage. All OP's do, it's a natural thing to do when you're mad like this. So most probably if we would solely hear his side we would think \"man, this dude is a slave to this family\". The truth is somewhere in the middle I think. In which they both need to learn how to become a unit again or call it quits.", "6wks is actually the healing period, after that it's fine to drive etc. I'm not debating that hubby is an AH (because in this case he is), just clarifying that healing timeline as someone who's had a c-section \ud83d\udc4d\n\nHubby is incredibly out of touch with his family of he thinks a trip away is appropriate right now though, regardless of the healing time. A new baby is hard enough when that's your only child, but with a toddler in the dynamic as well it's beyond inconsiderate to leave a struggling spouse at home alone to manage all of that."]}
