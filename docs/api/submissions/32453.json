You gave him a name to work with so he should have been content with it. It\u2019s not his place to judge or ask questions about the name you chose. It could be short for Julian, you could be trans, could be buying the coffee for someone else, etc.\n\nHowever I think your reaction makes you an AH. Mainly for swearing and causing a scene in the restaurant.

However, when it comes to everyday transactions, such as buying a doughnut, it's important to weigh the potential risks against the convenience of providing your name.\n\nIn the scenario you presented, the cashier at the doughnut shop was simply following their company's policy of collecting customer names for record and receipt purposes. While you may have found this request intrusive, it's worth noting that it's a common practice in many businesses, particularly those that handle food or other items that may require tracking or recalls.\n\nYour decision to provide a fake name was understandable, given your discomfort with sharing personal information. However, your subsequent outburst and refusal to provide your name were unnecessarily aggressive and disrespectful towards the cashier, who was simply doing their job.\n\nWhile your privacy concerns are valid, it's important to remember that there's a difference between expressing your concerns politely and resorting to personal attacks. In this situation, you could have calmly explained your discomfort with providing your name and inquired about alternative options, such as using a phone number or email address instead.\n\nIn conclusion, while your initial hesitation to provide your name was understandable, your subsequent actions were over the top. It's important to strike a balance between protecting your privacy and interacting with others in a respectful manner.\n\nVerdict: While your initial hesitation was understandable, your reaction was overly aggressive.

He might be an AH for his behavior, but the guy working the checkout had it coming when he wouldn't accept Juli.", "If it was a coffee shop and I had to wait for them to make my drink and call me, sure no problem I completely understand why they'd ask for a name. But this is a place I've bought doughnuts from for years and the first time they ever asked for a name. They hand you the doughnut almost immediately after you pay so its not like there's any good reason for them to ask for my name other than to make it appear on the receipt.", "He did answer though, and was called out for it. What if he actually identified as Juli? Cashier is equally to blame her, so ESH.", "I know a person who looks like Diana but goes by the name Dave. They would have been very upset if someone didn't take their name seriously.", "right!! i wish that was my biggest problem too", "OP gave the cashier a name and the cashier wouldn\u2019t accept it.

Fun fact: companies can change their policies at any time!", "You wanted a answer so why argue the opinion just because it doesnt suit what you wanted to hear? You already knew yta so why pretend to be suprised?", "I said the cashier was an AH. I just think OP was more of one. The cashiers question could be attributed to not knowing better or even just a knee-jerk response that slipped out. OP, on the other hand, went nuclear over being called out for a fake name. Probably because he was embarrassed that he got caught in a lie, and he reacted in a childish way to someone doing their job. No genuinely gender nonconforming person is going to react like that because it's generally considered unsafe for them to rock the boat.", "Remember now, first world problems are also problems", "And, unlike OP, you wouldn't have been an asshole.  It's the cursing part that makes him the asshole.", "With something like collecting names for receipt purposes it might get dicey if you give a fake name because it could be flagged if the name doesn\u2019t match the name attached to the bank account.", "The cashier didn\u2019t say \u201cno it\u2019s not\u201d, he just asked. Sure it\u2019s a little strange, but OP gave a woman\u2019s name and maybe the cashier was just joking. OP took it to the next level while apparently not wanting to cause a scene", "He had a man telling him a woman's name. He found it odd. It's instinctive. OP could have just said \"yes it is\". Had the cashier insisted afterwards then I'd agree. But the instinctive reaction when someone is different from what you expect is perfectly normal.", "And what lawful basis might that be pray tell? They serve coffee and donuts, so at best they can ask for consent and albeit rather rude we can with certainty say that consent was not given by OP. There's no contractual or legal obligations as it's simply receipts for coffee and donuts. There's no vital interests, nor public task. That leaves legitimate interests, but again, it's a coffee shop.", "I agree with you 100% percent, but I think OP sucks a little bit, if not for anything else than the fact that he said to shove a donut up their ass. I like donuts, they should be eaten, not be administered rectally.", "So OP is an AH, cashier is an AH, the store policy is an AH policy. I think we can therefore safely say ESH.", "No way a donut shop would have access to bank account numbers, but if they did and If they linked account numbers to names it would be a huge violation of privacy.", "I agree with you on that! The language chosen by OP was unnecessary.", "When the levels of AH are not on even vaguely at the same level, I tend to go with a YTA for the biggest AH, which is OP. The store policy is likely just trying to copy Starbucks to establish customer connections, and the cashier said something stupid. OP was just a straight-up AH.\n\nYou're allowed to have your opinion in this, and so am I. Our opinions are not the same and that's fine. \ud83d\ude42", "The employees would have access to the information - it would be encrypted - but it\u2019s like when you buy something online, if the name you give and the name on the account don\u2019t match it can (and has in my experience) lead to the payment being rejected/denied"]}
