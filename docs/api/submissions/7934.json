No wonder your wife is literally vomiting. \n\nFirst off, you are a LIAR.  And a sneaky liar.  You can't make one good cc payment and magically go from a 500 to 700 credit score.  Second, being shit with finances (and financially deception! agh) is such a leading cause for divorce.  I'd be scared to marry you, now this poor lady is already married to you.  What next? You going to take her cc's and max them out?", "YTA\r  \n\r  \nYou lied to her about your finances and skirted around your credit score, which you knew was bad. You knew full well she was going full steam ahead with this, yet said not a word when you knew she absolutely needed that information. Once it blew up in your face you have the gall to be mad when she had to look up your credit score for the mortgage? She didn't go behind your back with these appointments either, from my view, she was telling you everything as it happened.", "YTA.  Whether you want to face it or not, you have been lying this whole time, and this is a huge betrayal.  If you only need 3-6 months to clean up your credit (which tells me you have no idea how any of this works, because it takes 7 YEARS for negative things to leave your credit report), you would have done it already.  \n\nYou will be very lucky if she ever trusts you again.", "YTA. You lied about your finances, you lied about your goals, you\u2019re lying to everyone else about your marriage. You need a therapist and a lawyer, not Reddit.", "YTA for lying repeatedly about your credit score.  And more lies about getting married. You are a deceitful person.\n\nI see your wife's age, but not yours. How old are you?", "YTA: You knew how important the house was, and you lied about your credit score. Lies of omission are still lies. A score in the 500s won't be fixed in a short amount of time even if you pay off that card. You're going to need YEARS, to get to a decent score.\n\nMost banks won't even look at you with less than 700 score for a decent rate. You've fucked up big....\n\n\nA single maxed card with a few missed payments should not have your score at 500 unless you have a poor credit history to start. Which regardless should have been discussed before marriage\n\nYou say you don't know how plans for June ended up January??? Buddy you have to start the pre-approval process MONTHS in advance, she started everything at the right time for June anyways", "YTA for trying to hide your bad credit from your wife, it\u2019s not because everything \u201cmoved too fast\u201d. Bad credit is bad credit.  You\u2019ve been lying to her, doesn\u2019t matter how you phrase it.  This is on top of the lies about your marital status which is a whole other can of worm! It sounds like your wife is being proactive and trying to get things in order and you\u2019re dragging your feet and burying your head in the sand. Mostly to avoid being honest. Buying a home is a long process, it\u2019s not going to be done in a few weeks. Nor will your credit be instantly fixed when you pay down a card. That\u2019s not how this works. That\u2019s not how any of this works.", "YTA for not being up front about your credit issues. And it's likely going to take longer than just paying off one credit card to get your score up. It took us \\*years\\* to go from poor (which your score is) to excellent. Be sure you know what lowers your score while doing this. (i.e., applying for more credit lowers your score, etc.,) so you're not wiping out any good you're doing.", "YTA just for not being open and honest about this with her from the start because every marriage is also a business partnership. Now this has all blown up because she was working to the time frame you two originally agreed and you never told her your circumstances had changed. She's understandably frustrated and upset to the point where it's making her ill. Things aren't 'moving too fast'.  Your wife has just been out getting the facts while you've been stalling.", "YTA\n\nDo not **ever** try to rush into something as huge as buying a house.  Wait until you are good and ready, financially and emotionally.  It is the biggest purchase you'll ever make.  Also, waiting until you improve your credit score is a must.\n\nHowever, you are the AH here because you didn't tell your wife this upfront.  Basically you lied to her by not telling her.   So she thought everything was Go, when you knew full well it would not be.  If I were your wife, I'd be upset with you as wel.\n\nI know it was probably because you feel ashamed.  But if you can't trust your wife with this, you have no business marrying her, no matter how much you \"love\" her.  Love has trust as its foundation.", "YTA\n\nYou lied about your finances, and you're also being delusional about how long it's going to take for your credit score to be fixed if it's too low to be approved for a mortgage. If you paid off that card today, you're still looking at 18-24 months for your credit score to improve.", "YTA. You are a liar and you've been misleading your wife.\n\nOh I just need to pay my credit card off and it'll all be better.\n\nBro that's not how credit scores work when you are this delinquent. 500 says you're terrible with your credit.\n\nGood luck in this relationship.", "YTA. This is the BIGGEST purchase and business agreeement you are entering with your wife. But you lied and were being avoidant when you agreed to a crazy timeline to close on a house. This will cause a major strain on your relationship for your wife to lose total trust in you as a man. Why aren\u2019t you and your wife working as a team? You both need to be in agreement and on the same page. I wish you luck. Clean up your debt and credit. You will still need cash to close your house. I wish you two luck.", "Yes a little bit an AH. \"What a wicked web we weave when first we practice to deceive\".", "YTA. You've lied to your wife about your financial situation and the likelihood of you being able to buy a house together. \n\nAnd there was something else...\n\n>I\u2019ve missed a few payments on a maxed out credit card and the fees for missed payments and the interest have built up on the card but if I just pay off this card it\u2019ll fix my credit because that card is the only problem I have. \r  \n\r\n\nOh yeah, and you're deluded if you think you can get your credit score automatically to an acceptable level by paying off this credit card. It isn't simply a case of needing to pay the card off. Missed payments (along with defaults and court judgements) will stay on your credit report for six years. \n\nYou are doubly deluded if you think you can buy a house for June. Even if you can pay off your credit cards in your 3-6 month timetable, and **if** a mortgage company is happy to offer you a mortgage of enough value to get the type of property you want, there is still the question of putting together the down payment - since its going to take you that long to pay off your credit card, I presume you don't have down payment sorted already.", "YTA. and you know nothing about credit. It doesn\u2019t just magically get better when you pay off the card. Missed payments take 7 years to clear alone and bad credit and general will take YEARS to build up from 500. FFS read a book about this before you try to buy a house. \n\nYou also knowingly misled your wife about this and you got mad at HER for finding out? Smh. You need to work on your credit and your communication BIG TIME.", "YTA. \nIt's not that things moved too fast.\nIt's that you did nothing *and* withheld information.\n\nYour credit score doesn't magically bounce back when you pay a delinquent debt. \n\nYou need to tell your wife asap so she has the option to pay off your debts so you can improve your credit.", "YTA\n\nYou should have been honest, and transparent, about it.  She could have helped.  This is a huge joint decision and you can't go into it with her blindfolded.", "Ok, dude, YTA but you have a chance to fix it. First, start paying off your card and no more late payments. Second, get therapy/counseling. Your mental tracking is a bit off here. Be honest with your wife from now on. Totally open with payments and show her you are working on it for her.", "OP is 36 and his wife is 22.\n\nHow can you expect to live in an adult relationship when you lie and omit information from your spouse? Your behaviour is actively hurting her, yet you don't seem to find anything wrong with it. Your approach to this relationship is more fitting to your wife's age than yours.\n\nYou are being a very bad partner, not to mention that you are in a relationship with a woman whose brain is not fully developed and who is 14 years your senior.\n\nYou know why people focus on that fact? Because it's simply wrong. There is literally no way for you not to I fluence someone whose brain is not fully developed. You're taking advantage of her age, no matter how much you're trying to deny it. And then you're not even an adequate partner. Stop lying to your wife. Stop hurting her. YTA", "YTA you lied to your wife about something pretty darn important.", "YTA, and you two need to have a long conversation. This deadline she gave herself to own a home is an unnecessary strain. But, she should be fully aware of who she\u2019s getting into this with. And lying about being married? I think you both need a year to work out a plan and also to really be sure this is what she wants to do.", "YTA For keeping things from her and for not understanding that if she wants a new house by June, the finances need to be squared away now. Buying a house, especially with a va loan, is a time consuming, red tape filled process.", "You\u2019re LYING by not giving straight answers. You\u2019re trying to make sure your wife sees you as a hero. She doesn\u2019t want a hero. She wants an honest partner who will make plans with her based on reality not based on the fantasy sometime in the future when you get your credit back up. She asked and you skirted. That\u2019s a major major issue.", "YTA. You sure you\u2019re ready to be married? Doesn\u2019t sound like it to me.", "YTA. You sound incredibly immature and irresponsible.  Nothing is ever your fault, huh?", "YTA\n\nHow can you possibly think you are ready to be married to anyone?", "YTA OMG I hope to goodness she realises before it is too late and gets the hell out of Dodge.", "Ummm you do *not* understand how credit works lol. PLEASE get credit counseling. No, your credit score will NOT be \"fine\" even if you pay off the card (which you clearly cannot do?) Jesus, YTA. So irresponsible and also a liar as well. I'd leave a man like you who lied and is also very arrogant, vastly overestimating his very limited knowledge. You don't even feel bad for making her so upset she puked. Such a major major ah.", "YTA for sooo many reasons, dude you should\u2019ve been honest about your credit score from the jump, you knew it was bad, you should\u2019ve told her that. \n\ncredit does not work the way you seem to think it does, fully paying off that card all at once is not going to dramatically raise your score from 500, it will still be bad.", "YTA and you\u2019re na\u00efve and financially irresponsible. You also seem like you don\u2019t take accountability for you own mistakes. I don\u2019t know why you think a magic pill will *fix everything* but it won\u2019t.", "Yta but also it sounds like there is a big age difference here?", "Oh shit, I honestly thought that last post you made was fake. Yeah you obviously have no idea how credit scores or home buying works at all. Probably a good thing you kept this account around bud. \n\nI would say do better but it seems that's a bit difficult for you. YTA", "op=YTA\n\nYou are hiding financial information from your WIFE.\n\nYou are being financially irresponsible.  Seriously, if you can't make your minimum payments you shouldn't have been charging that much.  And you should have been communicating with her the how and why of those lack of payments.\n\nA 500 SCORE when you KNOW that you and your wife wanted to buy a house, I can see why she's stress vomiting.\n\nAnd getting pre-approved for a loan is essential for getting a house that is highly sought/being bid on.  \n\nFigure out how to get your credit cleaned up and stop stressing out your wife who is trying to do everything right.", "YTA for not bringing this up sooner but I\u2019d recommend asking r/militaryfinance for some advice. It\u2019s clear people here don\u2019t understand how VA Loans work. There\u2019s a lot of loopholes and since the mortgage is backed some lending companies are much more forgiving on the credit score.", "Yikes yikes yikes so you can\u2019t handle your finances, don\u2019t understand credit scores, AND lie to your wife? Bad bro", "YTA. I sincerely hope she realizes who you are and leaves you now before she actually wastes her life with you.", "YTA. You should be honest with your wife, especially about things that affect her.  Even after you pay that card,  your credit will be poor due to the missed payments. You are in denial about how bad your debt is.  If you can pay it off,  do so. \nI suggest you look at the dave Ramsey method for finance.  You really need to sort it out.", "YTA.\n\nAs soon as you two decided you wanted to get a house you should have read up on the process, including how credit scores work.  You're 14 years older than her but she's the responsible one on every front.  She's the one who makes less, pays more of the bills yet manages to save money (unlike OP), does most of the house work, and just all-around understands how to be an adult far more than you do.\n\nThe terms for a VA loan are slightly better than some other types of loans, but chances are you've sunk her chance to get a house for years with your lackadaisical attitude.", "YTA I don\u2019t think your credit will go up that much. You missed payments that\u2019s a big hit. I don\u2019t think your credit is even in the ballpark to buy a house. When I bought a house my credit was in the 790 range. Va might be different .. I looked it up rocket mortgage says 580. I didn\u2019t realize it could be so low. You might be able to qualify. I would just go with her to the appointments and be honest with banker.", "YTA. Paying off that card will raise your score a bit but not as much as you think.  It's going to take more than a few months.", "Op YTA just paying off that card won't take your 500 score and jump it. It's going to take YEARS to build better credit than 500. I'm not much older than you. Just paid off a $3k credit card payment and my score jumped only 15 points. I don't know what you think will happen just by paying off that one issue but it won't suddenly make your score jump 100's of points to be able to qualify for a good loan. Also my husband used a VA loan twice for our house, when we first thought it, and refinanced in 2020. Both times we never needed a down payment, and closing costs got wrapped into his loan. Ontop of that it didn't take 45 days for either loan to be approved. Yours is going to take that long because your score is crap, and the more they run it the more it goes down. Credit karma doesn't affect scores but gives you an estimate of what it looks like, this came from all three credit companies when I filed for my credit reports due to identity theft. You're looking at a few years of being able to buy a house their buddy.", "Wow, I just had a flashback to my early married years.  My husband would financially rape us at every turn.  He'd gaslight me into believing everything was ok, then I'd get gut punched with surprise debt, wiped out savings, you name it.  It continued until I had him served with divorce papers.....we were able to work through it but he has never fucked me over again.  YTA to the max.  You need to get your finances in order fast.  Your wife needs to file for a separation to protect herself from you and she needs to unentangle her finances from yours.", "How old are you? I see you didn't mention your age, you have an older (?) daughter, and your wife is 24...\n\nAlso, in what world are your missed payments going to drop off in *months* as opposed to 7 very long years?\n\nYTA and a liar. You're legally married, but if you've convinced your wife to lie about that ON TOP of lying about your credit score, then she's married to a fantasy. I can't believe you think it's healthy to lie about these things!", "YTA. It's not \"your\" credit and \"her\" credit anymore, once you married both of your credit is combined. So she shouldn't have to \"go behind your back\" to see what your credit score is. You got caught being an irresponsible lying AH, so suck it up and apologize.", "No, YTA because you repeatedly lied to your wife about finances involving a major purchase. And your title is extremely misleading, so YTA for posting and trying to cover your a** at the same time? You were pissed at her for trying to see your score after months of lying, after she talked to a real estate agent twice??? You are beyond stupid on top of being an AH.", "Every time I start to think it might be worth dating a man, I read stuff like this and my lady bits just dry right up.", "ESH \u2014 you are TA for lying to your wife and giving her false hope. You both are TA for lying to your family about the marriage. You\u2019re adults, own up to your own lives. Doesn\u2019t matter what other people think.

They will likely give you advice on how to best manage current debt and how to correctly pay things off in a way that doesn't further affect your credit score.

You will need probably at least 1 to 2 years being generous to rebuild your credit.

If she is able to save and you are not, then you need to reassess your contribution to finances at least temporarily. Paying down your debt and managing your payments are the only option you have right now with a score in the 500s.\n\nEdit* As another user said, paying your debt in installments will also be better than one large lump sump. Paying continually will be better than at once as it will help build your score with \"on-time\" payments even if they're for a delinquent account. Paying in one lump sum does not show that you can pay consistently so it won't have a positive impact. \n\nIf your debt on the card is say $5000, pay off what is manageable for you, then put extra on top of your minimum payments.

Lopsided mix, particularly skewing to revolving debt = \ud83d\udea9\n\n21% Credit age - how old are your lines of credit? Longstanding credit lines = good; lots of new debt = \ud83d\udea9\n\n23% Credit usage - how much of your available credit are you tapping month over month? If you are using 30% or more of your monthly available credit =\ud83d\udea9\n\nAnd finally... (and this appears to be your downfall):\n\n40% Payment history - are you making full payments on time, every month?
