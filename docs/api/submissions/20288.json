Idk where you are but I think you can get fined for putting bags on chairs on the train?", "NTA but in the future If soemoen pulls out their phone like that again it is best to let them yell at you silently. Eventually they\u2019ll make an ass of themselves while you just mind your own business. Maybe bring headphones to ignore them better.", "In principle, NTA, but realistically this is a stranger and you don't know where they're at mentally. I would have just looked for another seat. To me it's not worth the risk of being attacked or worse. You asked and she gave an aggressive answer. Getting closer to her and handling her stuff was an escalation.", "Esh. I hate people who take up space on crowded public transport. She should have placed one on her lap, one between her feet like a normal person. \n\nYou could have stood or found another seat but just grabbing someone\u2019s bag and moving it is escalating. You both probably disrupted the journey for plenty of other people who are also tired from a hard day of work. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you have dealt with getting ignored, but you being Asian and your insecurities from (I\u2019m assuming) having harmful stereotypes and opinions thrust upon you is so irrelevant to this tale.

This goes against both quiet train rules and especially against busy train rules.\n\nMy only comment is that I would have asked politely if they could have moved their bag from the seat. But that is the British in me, and dealing with this situation on a regular basis. The Indian in me, on the other hand, has no issue with sitting wherever I want on a busy train", "NTA. She was too ignorant to move it herself.", "This.  You could fuck around and lose your life behind shit like this.", "Why stand when there's a perfectly good seat available? Op didn't escalate, just wanted a seat on a train they paid for. Politely asked and was told no, so sat down anyway. NTA.", "For real. OP's weaponized her race to justify being an AH.", "If you think the girl was rude, why would you not vote ESH?", "I would have picked it up and shoved it into her gut and sat down.  \nBut I'm an asshole and a bully. :-D", "nta but ur braveeee. i would be afraid to touch someone elses stuff", "NTA\n\nPersonally I think it's better to ask, and only escalate if they don't remove their stuff themselves. But it's worse of her to take up two seats on a crowded train. And then getting in your face about it, sheesh. She's TA.", "Just be careful. Don\u2019t get shot for a slightly less uncomfortable commute.", "NTA, if there was some reason she needed to keep the duffle on a seat (whatever the fuck that could be), then she should explain it. There's always some selfish bellend who leaves their bag on a seat in those situations and I think more people should move people's bag if they refuse to.\n\nAlthough I'm not sure why race is relevant in this conversation.", "NTA don't leave your bag on a seat when people need a seat never mind taking up 2 dam seats for bags", "NTA\n\nThe normal approach would be to ask a stranger to move their bag first before handing their possessions yourself. But given their complete lack of awareness, I don't really see any issue with what you did.", "Just to be clear, she got into an argument with you, not the other way around. She's the one that need to wonder if she's a massive AH (and she is). You did nothing wrong. People have no right to hog multiple chairs. NTA", "I'd reply sure I'll tell the Internet that you feel like your bags deserve 2 train seats while people stand :)", "> Don't touch people's stuff. \n\nBy your logic you could put 2 bags in front of the door and reserve the whole carriage for yourself. \n\nDon't want your stuff touched? Put it between your legs.  And no, I don't care how dirty the floor is.", "NTA, I on the other hand would have been a complete asshole in the same situation. If I would have asked and they said no. Then that bag would be thrown out the doors just as they are closing.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that she started recording and calling you names clearly means she was looking for trouble for the GRAM.", "\u201cI see no children here.

When she received a rude response, then she acted appropriately in my opinion. NTA", "Or stabbed. Or punched. I was called to jury duty for someone who stabbed another person over cutting in line to buy a chicken sandwich. Prioritize your life.", "Read the OP. She did exactly as you said.", "Yeah exactly. NTA, but people are crazy. They\u2019re shooting people for making the wrong turn on their driveway or over parking spots. It\u2019s not worth it to sit next to an aggressive person who might end up being a psycho.", "OP *did* ask. Jerk passenger refused.", "I missed that. Even so nothing wrong with what OP did", "sadly, yeah. you are in the right, but she could have hurt you. I'm glad you got out okay.", "OP was so far off-base, and what she did was significantly worse.", "Okay, and if the girl that OP moved her duffel bag was crazy and OP got shanked for touching her stuff? OP would be on here talking about how unfairly she was treated. Acting tough is not worth losing your life,or getting hurt.", "So you should just take shit from everyone just in case they have a knife on them?\n\n>OP would be on here talking about how unfairly she was treated. \n\nAnd you're saying that as if she'd be wrong? As if she deserved a stabbing for daring to move a person's bag off a seat?", "NTA - she\u2019s the asshole for not moving her stuff. She is entitled to one seat and so are you. Her baggage does not have the same rights as a human.", "NTA but I also would've just found somewhere else to sit and not touched someone's shit.", "Nta.", "Definitely NTA, sounds like you encountered an entitled, spoilt brat.", "NTA", "NTA.  She wouldn't move it, so you moved it for her.  It's rude to put your bags on the seat of a crowded bus or train, and it's considerate to remove your bags so people can sit.  You did nothing wrong.  It sounds like she was a selfish, entitled, brat.", "I cannot stand people like her. NTA", "TBH as soon as she said no, I would launch her bag up the train.\n\nNTA", "NTA. That young woman needs to learn how to behave in society. Taking up 3 seats on a crowded subway! That is ridiculous!\n\nI am so sorry that you had such an unpleasant incident on the subway.", "I read your first sentence and thought but \"that's not all right either\". Then I got to the second sentence and realised you called yourself out. If you own it, I can respect that.", "NTA and didn\u2019t need to read more than the title.\n\nThese entitled pricks do my head in, you\u2019re very much in the clear", "Nta. Be careful out there though. Don\u2019t get stabbed or shot just trying to make it home from work. I\u2019m from Cleveland, I personally wouldn\u2019t confront a shady stranger on public transportation here lol.", "NTA! Good for you for reclaiming the extra space she apparently felt entitled to. Her response suggests that she's got some kind of something going on there.", "Focus, sweetie pie, and try not to strawman my original point. We are talking about moving a stranger's personal property, not being in a vicinity.", "I'd of shoved it down her throat: it would shut her mouth and her bag would have a place to sit", "NTA - and i love the fact that you handed the bag to her instead of just setting it down.  She was being selfish and disrespectful of others on the train.", "NTA.  I mean you had to touch her stuff to move it, right?  Although I guess you could have asked for permission and when she said, \"No,\" just sat on it.  Bags don't pay the fare.  They belong on your lap like an infant.", "I guess you missed the whole point of this being a packed train... meaning, there's no other seats.", "For me, worth the risk.  First, lots of witnesses, so, if she attacks I'm clearly allowed to respond defensively.  Second, her sitting is a shit stance to do anything from, even worse when she's grabbing the duffle bag.", "Her response to the bot says she moved to a different train car. That could've been done instead of trying to move this person's bag", "I haven't seen her response... but this is such a terrible idea. No one should be moving to different train just to avoid another person who is actively breaking the rules. Grow a pair.", "lol", "What is the girl was crazy and she shanked OP just because he was within 5 feet of her? Would that make OP an A for standing within 5 feet of a random person on the subway?", "Yes to all 3 of your questions."]}
