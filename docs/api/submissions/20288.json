I know it wasn\u2019t wise to keep engaging but it also didn\u2019t feel like an option to just silently let her continue to yell at me.

To me it's not worth the risk of being attacked or worse. You asked and she gave an aggressive answer. Getting closer to her and handling her stuff was an escalation.", "Esh. I hate people who take up space on crowded public transport. She should have placed one on her lap, one between her feet like a normal person. \n\nYou could have stood or found another seat but just grabbing someone\u2019s bag and moving it is escalating. You both probably disrupted the journey for plenty of other people who are also tired from a hard day of work. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you have dealt with getting ignored, but you being Asian and your insecurities from (I\u2019m assuming) having harmful stereotypes and opinions thrust upon you is so irrelevant to this tale.

This goes against both quiet train rules and especially against busy train rules.\n\nMy only comment is that I would have asked politely if they could have moved their bag from the seat.
