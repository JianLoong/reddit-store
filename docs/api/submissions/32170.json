Paraplegic/handicapped people do not rely on random parking spaces that may or may not be available when and where they need to park. \n\nIf a residence needs a dedicated handicapped street parking space to accommodate a resident, they go through the city and can get one marked off with signage and street markings, that requires a specific permit to park in.

How can anybody possibly count on parking when a space on the street may or may not be available?  Off the top of my head one possibility would be for somebody to scout out a space beforehand, then move their vehicle when the next person is ready to park.  But to ask some random person to move their already parked car is ridiculous. What world do you live in?", "Apparently in a world with very different rules than yours. Read back what you just said. The handicapped person *has to have a plan*. What if *the plan* involves calling their friend ahead of time, asking them to scout out a spot for them so they can park and also have enough space to get out? By your logic, you\u2019d tell the friend to fuck off and they should\u2019ve been faster, even though you had just parked and were on a street that you didn\u2019t even live on.

I've had a similar issue, and when the neighbor who thought they owned the street couldn't get me towed, they started making up lies to tell the management company where I lived about how I was a bad tenant and breaking the rules (which I wasn't). Old people who have nothing better to do than bitch can find lots of ways to make your life hard. My lease wasn't renewed at the end of contract because they complained constantly about me.

As someone who cares about their car I would do the same thing as you, and also be annoyed at their questions. What you need to consider is that they\u2019re the ones around your car when it\u2019s parked. They can call you in for any violations, park it in,  try to get it towed, or even vandalize it themselves. They could also be the ones who call the police when someone tries to break into it or steal it and witnesses for your insurance company. A better response would be: \u201c I live down the street where parked cars suffer hit-and-runs all the time. This street is much safer and nicer(flattery works) so I park here.

But it sounds like nobody else does this.\n\nYeah, it's a little weird to always park in the same place, in front of the same house, on an otherwise empty street, and it's not crazy for folks to wonder what's going on.  It's invasive to knock on the window, but they may have already been in front of the car, waving at you and otherwise trying to get your attention.\n\nIt's officially legal, but it's still an AH move, especially if you're (as others pointed out) storing a motorcycle or boat or something in your assigned spot.

Students used to park in neighborhoods close to campus to avoid paying high university parking costs. Now, September through May you need a sivker on your car to street park in those neighborhoods.

Possibly the off street parking isn't free and has to be rented. Or it's not assigned and the fcfs parking is a deathsport because 1 spot per unit isn't actually enough when every unit has multple adult occupants with a car.\n\nAll valid reasons for parking on the street.
