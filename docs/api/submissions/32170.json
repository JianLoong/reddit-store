Public street parking is open to everybody, and first come first gets the spot", "\u201cPlease help, officer, that man talked to me.\u201d", "You wouldn\u2019t move your vehicle if a paraplegic person needed the space on the end of the street to maneuver and get out of their vehicle? Then YTA", "What are you talking about? Paraplegic/handicapped people do not rely on random parking spaces that may or may not be available when and where they need to park. \n\nIf a residence needs a dedicated handicapped street parking space to accommodate a resident, they go through the city and can get one marked off with signage and street markings, that requires a specific permit to park in.  How do you think this would work otherwise?", "If you think all handicapped people always have designated handicapped spots every place that they want or need to go, for example visiting a friend\u2019s house in the city where there\u2019s not designated parking, then you\u2019re na\u00efve at best, and still the AH. This happens to my old boss all the time. They don\u2019t make handicap spaces for every single situation", "Of course not, that is why people in that situation have to have a plan. How can anybody possibly count on parking when a space on the street may or may not be available?  Off the top of my head one possibility would be for somebody to scout out a space beforehand, then move their vehicle when the next person is ready to park.  But to ask some random person to move their already parked car is ridiculous. What world do you live in?", "Apparently in a world with very different rules than yours. Read back what you just said. The handicapped person *has to have a plan*. What if *the plan* involves calling their friend ahead of time, asking them to scout out a spot for them so they can park and also have enough space to get out? By your logic, you\u2019d tell the friend to fuck off and they should\u2019ve been faster, even though you had just parked and were on a street that you didn\u2019t even live on. You\u2019re an asshole - just embrace it", "WTF are you talking about? What you just wrote does not make any sense.  \n\nWhat I wrote is that that if a person absolutely needs a parking spot in a particular area, they should have a plan to make this happen, that involves procuring a spot beforehand if necessary\n\nI give up with you.
