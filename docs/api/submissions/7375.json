Drinks, games, music, etc. I wasn't invited, so I stayed home to enjoy a good book.\n\nAbout 4 hours into my partner being away, I began to feel sick. Like, massive migraine, vomiting, explosive diarrhoea, chills, weakness... the works. Meds weren't working. I felt like (and still feel like) absolute shit. Only, at the time I felt much worse, to the point where I didn't feel right being by myself, and really needed him home. I messaged him that I felt like crap and could use some help at home, but he didn't respond. I called him, and told him how much I needed some comfort and support, and didn't feel safe being by myself right now (I've had past medical issues that can send me to emerg if flare up), and he said he'd come home soon.\n\nOne hour passed.  I was still vomiting and in a lot of pain, and called him in tears, leaving a message. He didn't respond. I texted and he finally said he had called an Uber and would be coming shortly. 1.5 more hours pass and he still hadn't arrived, so I called him again in tears. He hadn't left the party yet. I told him he was inconsiderate, an a-hole, and had no compassion.\n\nHe arrived home 2 hours after I last contacted him. And I was still dry heaving and having chills.\n\nHe told me I shouldn't have asked him to leave the party early, because he hadn't seen his friends in over a month and wanted to have fun.  I couldn't deal with an argument feeling like crap, so I fell asleep.\n\nThis morning I thought  if he can't care for his partner when I really need him, then he doesn't get to have fun during the good times. I'm thinking of cancelling his trip ticket on my family's trip together to Bahamas. When I told him, he freaked out. I'm still torn.\n\nSo: AITA for asking my partner to come home early from the party to take care of me when I was sick, and WIBTA if I cancelled his trip ticket?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUPDATE: Because I've been asked: This isn't the first time he's bailed on me during a medical episode. If it was the first time, I probably wouldn't have thought about cancelling the ticket.\n\nAnd I didn't head to emerg because there is a 13+ hour wait to be triaged. I wait it out as a last-ditch effort if I REALLY need it. Otherwise, I try to have someone with me to keep me safe in case I pass out, seize, or need help. Unfortunately, I live away from all family and friends, so it's not like I can actually have someone else with me besides my partner. And at this time of evening I couldn't call family in their time zone. \n\nAt this point I'm just really in a lot of pain emotionally, because I'm feeling like I'm weighing 10 years of togetherness vs the future.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1673770106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cecvs/aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_leave_a_party_early/", "score": 210, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

(His reaction makes it seem like this wasn't the first time.)", "INFO: Something feels missing. Why weren't you invited? Were you resentful of that fact?\n\nDoes he often claim he's going to do things and then just ignore you? Because lying like that is generally not OK.\n\nOn the other hand, do you often have some kind of crisis just when he happens to be out?

Him ignoring a possible medical emergency to have fun is breakup material. You aren't nearly as bad, but that course of action would just be vindictive and spiteful, with a possible borderline illegal shade.  \nThat said, you should absolutely leave him.

If I called my husband when he was with friends and told him that I was so sick I needed him home, he would leave immediately. Not only that, he would be SUPER concerned about how sick I was because I\u2019ve only ever been sick enough to need his company if it was a medical emergency and I needed to go to the ER or at least, see a doctor. Or if there was a task I couldn\u2019t do safely on my own like watch the kids, but I didn\u2019t see any mention of that.

If it got that bad, you should have called an ambulance and headed to hospital. \nNow to retaliate and talk of cancelling his trip ticket, you suck. Seriously bloody immature response IMO. Grow the heck up.", "YTA. I am sorry but you sound to be exaggerating your symptoms. Worse case scenario, you call ER and they decide how serious it is. Unless your partner is a medical professional, he can\u2019t do much. \n\nMany partners freak out and find excuses to have them back home because they cannot stand the thought of the partner having fun without them.

Do you often get sick when he\u2019s not with you? Are you guys generally happy/do you actually love him? Who\u2019s paying for the trip? Would your vacation be better without him? How are the finances between you managed (i.e. does only one party get to dictate how money is spent)?**\n\nIf he does this kind of thing a lot and you\u2019re fed up, by all means cancel his ticket. But at that point, just break up because unless you guys seriously address this problem, the relationship is going to end up with you both one-upping each other with punishments/neglect. And yes I\u2019m implicating both of you even if this is a one-sided problem. However unfair, it\u2019s gonna be on you to make him explicitly aware of how his actions hurt you and fixing things may require therapy not just for him but for you both as a couple.\n\nIf this relationship is as it appears, I\u2019ve seen couples do this kind of thing before. They\u2019re negatively competitive with each other and keep track of \u201cgood deeds\u201d to lord over each other. You can get kind of addicted to it if you\u2019re the type of person who sees relationships in terms of an eternal argument with winners and losers. But it\u2019s not healthy, so you\u2019re gonna have to decide if you\u2019re both committed to changing it or if you\u2019re better off breaking up, because the current mindset you guys are in is unsustainable and immature.", "NTA. \n\nBased on what you wrote, you were sick to the point of needing a companion and he completely ignored you multiple times. \n\nDid this ever happen in the past or was it the first?", "YTA - if you\u2019re having a medical episode seek medical help. Seems like you wanted an excuse for him to home since you weren\u2019t invited. Now you\u2019re being spiteful by canceling this trip.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner ignored your very real medical problem to have fun. He repeatedly said he'd come home, and then didn't. He lied to you about coming home so he could get you to shut up so he could continue having fun.\n\nDoes he care for you at all? \n\nBased on him ignoring you when you're ill, not once but multiple times, and the way he blatantly blows you off, I would dump him in addition to cancelling his ticket. His absolute disregard for your health and safety is horrible. You'd be better off finding someone who treats you better.", "YTA - What exactly did you need from him, besides hugs and \"there there\" pats? Just sounds like you were offended you weren't invited. If he had any real concerns about this leading to an emergency emergency, (you've been together for 10yrs after all and don't think you'd stayed a decade with a man who didn't), he'd probably have come home ASAP. And when he did infact come home, you went to sleep..  You just sound needy.", "YTA you were feeling sick but your partner is no doctor and you say you actually wanted confort.\n\nIf the meds didn't work, i guess the only logical thing to do is go to a hospital, especially if you say that you have some medical conditions and you were feeling sick.

I get that he should consider his role in a relationship with someone who has recurrent medical problems - but that\u2019s a deeper relationship issue that will not be solved by using the trip as an ultimatum.", "YTA and there are so many issues to address here\n\n- he went to a party you weren\u2019t invited to\n\nYour response was to suddenly become sick and need him to come hom\n\n- he didn\u2019t come home immediately, or even after multiple calls\n\nThis shows it\u2019s not a one off, and comes across that you regularly try to keep him from seeing friends\n\n- you say you still feel nearly as bad today\n\nBut you can write a comprehensive and factual post with complete grammar and spelling?\n\n- you threatened to cancel his ticket on the trip because you didn\u2019t get the attention you wanted\n\nDo you realise how this comes across?\n\nYou are a walking \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9and are gaslighting and trying to emotionally manipulate your partner.", "ESH.  You had a bit of food poisoning or norovirus or a stomach bug.  It's not great to be in your own but tbh, what could your partner actually do got you at this point? Not much.  Equally he could have come home earlier.   You cancelling a ticket for a family trip is totally OTT.", "Cancelling his ticket sees like a revenge tactic when you could just sit down and have a conversation about your expectations from this relationship. I feel like there\u2019s a lot of info left out of here. YTA.", "YTA. \n\nI think you've been deliberately evasive regarding some details that might be important, so a lot of people are making assumptions. People have asked why you weren't invited to the party, and also if these kind of episodes have happened before while he has been out - could you answer them, as I feel they both provide important background to your situation.\n\nAlso, were you happy for him to go to this party without you, or did you have discussions about him not going beforehand, even if it was resolved in the end? \n\nI think \"stopping\" your partner from going on a holiday sounds very controlling and in my opinion, it doesn't seem as though this is the first time you've stopped him from doing something as a punishment. You could explain to him that you're very disappointed that he didn't respond to you when you felt vulnerable, but to stop him doing something is over the top. You're going to make him resent you and your health issues if you start to limit his life. He isn't a child and it isn't your job to punish him. \n\nI feel this is also one of those cases where if the genders were reversed, the responses would be much harsher.\n\nAlso, what are you going to do if you have an episode while he's in the Bahamas? If you don't have someone nearby already who can offer you medical assistance in the event that you're unwell, you probably need to find somebody.", "YTA. He finally got home and you...went to sleep. Well, some emergency that was.", "YTA - It\u2019s going to get old pretty quick if every time you have an illness of any kind you need him around just in case you pass out or have a fit.

It certainly won\u2019t help your relationship be happier, you are just escalating things.\n\nI love on my own and have a heart condition. Friends and family are all in different cities.

You are both inconsiderate of each other. He probably didn't think much of your situation, which could be seen as an insensitive move. Telling you he is on the way and buying time isn't respectful. That being said, you are now blackmailing him by threatening to cancel his trip. Those are all the signs of an unhealthy relationship where partners hold no respect for each other.", "YTA", "YTA. OP, you are a full-grown adult that is capable of taking care of yourself. Then you're doubling down on your pettiness by threatening to cancel his ticket? He needs to run for the hills. You sound like a lot.", "ESH He's an absolute jerk for not coming home when you told him you didn't feel safe alone. Even worse for lying to you about having left.\n\nBut taking away the trip because he doesn't deserve good times is a shitty way of dealing with it.\n\nYou two need to communicate, not find new ways to hurt each other. Maybe the conversation leads to you breaking up because he isn't the partner you need, but that's the only way I see taking him off the trip that doesn't just make your relationship worse.", "NTA and I think the people here are missing the point and pattern.   \n\n\nWhy should he come to the trip when he can't be there for you? This isn't the first time as you have stated. I honestly think you should leave him. Take the trip away and move closer to family. That is the best option.", "Have to go with ESH. You for wanting to cancel his ticket for something you knew could happen because it happened before instead of finally breaking up with him and him for ignoring you being so sick. Your relationship just sounds unhealthy", "I'll go ESH. Yes he 100% should have come home to you when you needed him, especially given your medical history and the very real danger that you were in. You were not \"just sick\"..\n\nHowever cancelling his ticket isnt the way to go. It doesnt adress the issue at all, it resolves nothing. Its just a way to get revenge (however sweet that may feel in the moment..) but doesnt help with the way forward..\n\nAnd if like you said, this has happened before... it might be time to seriously evaluate if this is what you want and need in a relationship?", "I think I agree with the ESHs\nYou\u2019re not TA for asking him to come home. \nHe is TA lying to you, saying he would come home and then not leaving. If he didn\u2019t want to leave to take care of you, he should have at least said that straight away instead of stringing you on for hours. \nBut YWBTA for cancelling his ticket on your family\u2019s trip. Punishment is not a healthy part of a romantic partnership (unless it\u2019s consensual). \nEither break up or work on your relationship.

I think it is 100% reasonable to expect your partner to come home (and your partner volunteer to come home!) if you were vomiting. Also, you didn\u2019t ask him to come home after 20 minutes, he had more than 4hrs to socialize and catch up with friends. I understand not wanting to go to the ER with potential huge costs involved. \n\nI think if you\u2019re prepared to cancel the ticket after ten years, you need to reevaluate if you should even be together.

The first few days I needed help and my boyfriend was checking up on me. My boyfriend spent all of last week plus earlier this week making sure I was okay.\n\nHe was absolutely exhausted and he ended up getting sick again.

I'm sorry, is he your partner or your teenage son? Because I can't imagine how you would think that was appropriate. YWBTA, for sure.\n\nEDIT: Following OP's post edit, I need to adjust my response. OP is NTA, but instead of cancelling their partner's ticket, OP needs to just cancel their partner.

Break up with him and cancel the ticket or stay with him and don't. But you don't punish your SO because they were an absolute jerk. Not if your goal is to stay together. Two wrongs don't make a right is a saying for a reason. You canceling the trip is not going to change his behavior or encourage him to be nice to you.", "You were scared, had no other options, and wanted someone on hand in case you passed out or had a seizure. I don't think you're the asshole for being scared and asking your life partner to make you a priority. \n\nWhat makes your partner the asshole to me is that he kept saying he was on his way then not coming. Like he kept lying to you and made you wait hours for him. He should have at least had the decency to say he wasn't coming so that you could find someone else to check in on you. \n\nThe fact that this is a pattern is really concerning. I do think cancelling his ticket on your family's trip is petty and really more about \"punishing\" him than addressing the situation, so I don't think that's the right move. \n\nGiven how betrayed you must feel right now, however, I say you are NTA.", "NTA.

Drinks, games, music, etc. I wasn't invited, so I stayed home to enjoy a good book. \n\nAbout 4 hours into my partner being away, I began to feel sick. Like, massive migraine, vomiting, explosive diarrhoea, chills, weakness... the works. Meds weren't working. I felt like (and still feel like) absolute shit. Only, at the time I felt much worse, to the point where I didn't feel right being by myself, and really needed him home. I messaged him that I felt like crap and could use some help at home, but he didn't respond. I called him, and told him how much I needed some comfort and support, and didn't feel safe being by myself right now (I've had past medical issues that can send me to emerg if flare up), and he said he'd come home soon. \n\nOne hour passed.  I was still vomiting and in a lot of pain, and called him in tears, leaving a message. He didn't respond. I texted and he finally said he had called an Uber and would be coming shortly. 1.5 more hours pass and he still hadn't arrived, so I called him again in tears. He hadn't left the party yet. I told him he was inconsiderate, an a-hole, and had no compassion. \n\nHe arrived home 2 hours after I last contacted him. And I was still dry heaving and having chills. \n\nHe told me I shouldn't have asked him to leave the party early, because he hadn't seen his friends in over a month and wanted to have fun.  I couldn't deal with an argument feeling like crap, so I fell asleep.\n\nThis morning I thought  if he can't care for his partner when I really need him, then he doesn't get to have fun during the good times. I'm thinking of cancelling his trip ticket on my family's trip together to Bahamas. When I told him, he freaked out. I'm still torn.\n\nSo: AITA for asking my partner to come home early from the party to take care of me when I was sick, and WIBTA if I cancelled his trip ticket?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "ESH\n\nI can see why you are mad. However, cancelling a ticket seems to be a bit far and you should re-think it. \n\nYour partner needs to be a bit more compassionate.", "If the story is legit (I understand people's doubts) then you're NTA for asking him to come home. His nonchalant attitude makes me think either a) he's extremely uncaring or b)he didn't believe you or believe how seriously you were ill. Its tough to decide. I remember me and my now wife went to a Fleetwood mac concert just before we left the hotel to go to the venue I started to feel sick, literally as they appeared on stage I had to run to vomit, I tried to perservere but was just to ill. I told her I had to go back to the hotel. She offered to come back with me but I told her to stay, there wouldn't be alot she could do for me. Logically I just felt while I would like the support I'd rather she had a good time. In the end I was so ill the hotel called an ambulance hahaha she got back just as the paramedics arrived to take a look at me. I was fine just food poisoning. The point is, if you were truly worried about your safety you should contact medical people, I'm not absolving him of AH status as not seeing your friends for just a month is not that big of a deal imo, but using safety as a stick to beat him with when you didn't seek medical attention isn't really ok. \n\nOn the second part. You would be the AH if you uninvited him from your families trip. That just seems like an act of revenge rather than any attempt to make the situation better or improve the relationship. I think if you feel this strongly you need to have a serious conversation with him about how unhappy in the relationship you are", "INFO:\n\n- how often does it happens that he or you both need to leave an activity bc you become sick?\n- who is your support person when your partner is out of town and can't return immidiately?\n\nDepending on your answer, and if he is your only support system, then you seem to be extremly dependent on him and i would understand that he is tired of being your only support IF this happens often, like once a month, and he had to leave activities bc of this. Its fair to expect the partner to be there with you in emergency situations, its not really fair to expect it to be always him to be there when its a recurring thing for 7 years and you still didn't managed to get some more ppl for your support system. There will come a point (or already reached) where he starts feeling more like your caregiver than your partner.", "YTA.\nIf you're waiting 13 hours in triage YOU ARE NOT SICK ENOUGH TO BE THERE.\nStop wasting everyone's time. Stop harassing this poor guy. I think he should break up with you because you're clearly a shitty person.", "ESH. I was married to a woman who would absolutely hang out with friends instead of helping me in a time of need, and I'll be the first to say, it was frustrating and made me think she didn't give a shit about me (which I later found out she really didn't) and it filled me with resentment when I would bend over backwards for her and she really didn't lift a finger to help me in any way. BUT, to cancel a trip for them seems a little over the top bitter and a little coercive. If it were me, and this happened repeatedly, I'd do one of two things. A) find backup plans in case he's not available. B) Break up with this person and find someone else.", "YTA.  Being sick as an adult does not require the presence of another person, even an SO, other than if one needs a medical professional.  Shocking fact:  single people get sick and actually often live to tell.", "I am always in awe of relationships that function like this: \u201cI\u2019m sick. No, it\u2019s not an emergency. Please come home from something special that you\u2019re doing and comfort me.\u201d Let me just say, if I were this sick, no one would come home for me, nor would I want them to. What would they do anyway? Keep me company during an episode of explosive diarrhea? Lend an ear so I can whine about how bad my stomach hurts?\n\nUnless OP has a serious medical condition, then I don\u2019t see why the partner coming home makes any sense. Does she have cancer? A seizure condition? Is she physically unsafe if left by herself? No? Then she\u2019s just being dramatic. \n\nWHY has SO bailed on OP for other medical \u201cemergencies\u201d that weren\u2019t really emergencies? Because reading between the lines, it really feels like OP was being dramatic and SO is desensitized to her theatrics. \n\nThat being said, SO needs to face this head on, not avoid it. This is never going to resolve if all he does is pretend OP\u2019s behavior away. Answer the phone. Deal with OP. Don\u2019t promise something he doesn\u2019t intend to do. What if emergency services actually needed called, but he\u2019s ignored her for hours because she\u2019s like the boy who called wolf? \n\nOP, YTA. I think you are likely in the wrong overall. You seem very un-self-reliant and are probably a hypochondriac, and vindictive about a ticket to boot. But in your defense, your boyfriend sounds far too avoidant and is ignoring what is clearly an issue for him in your relationship.", "If you have a medical condition wich makes you depend on other living far away from people you can't count on depending on just one person is a pretty bad idea. In this case he could have cared, and just didn't. And frankly, if you don't care for me in an emergency, I don't really need you in my life. But there is always the possibility that the other one just can't, because they are out of reach. When this is a permanent condition that is disabling you, your partner should consider whether this is something he can live with, and as stated above, you should take care to have a larger safety net then just one person.\nIf it is rare and you are otherwise a healthy person and think about starting a family with this man: don't.\n\nRemoving him from a family holiday gives the vibes of punishing a kid by taking away his privileges. \n\n>This morning I thought if he can't care for his partner when I really need him, then he doesn't get to have fun during the good times\n\nYou are talking about separation here. If you don't have him in times of need, and don't share fun times with him, there won't be a happy partner time in between.", "As a person with sudden onset migraines, I fully understand the need to have your partner there. For those who haven't had them: they can immediately disable you. Having someone you trust at hand can comfort, as OP used, but it's also genuinely potentially saving. These symptoms literally mimic stroke at times. And, yeah, it really sucks. And it sucks to do leave a partner suffering. A previous partner literally left me because he \"felt more like a parent than a partner\" because he had to stand by me as I was debilitated. (Yes, that really messed me up for trust for a while.)\n\nHere's where I'm at. Migraines can be unpredictable and completely ruining. Unfortunately, stress and anxiety can help contribute to them. If OP was especially stressed about partner being gone (or even maybe past behavior?), this could've helped trigger it *but it wasn't intentional or malicious.* \n\nPartner shouldn't have lied through his teeth. OP thought they were coming home, so didn't attempt anything else. I'll also mention that I've fought going to the ER because that waiting room alone makes everything 10\u00d7 worse (blessed be the quick triage and empty ER).\n\nNTA for taking partner at face value.\n\nYWB T A for just cancelling his ticket without ending it. If your partner isn't with you through chronic illness, they're not the person for you. I'm sorry, OP. It sucks, but I also promise that there are people out there who are understanding and caring of chronic stuff. You can do this.", "NTA\n\n\nThe Uber lie would have made me cancel the trip.\nYou're in pain and needed him and he lies making you think he'd be there soon", "NTA", "NTA \n\nI'm sorry WHAT your girlfriend is really sick and needs support and your reaction is to continue to lie to her that you are coming home and call her inconsiderate and a a**hole. What if it was something critical? Op I think you need to reconsider your relationship", "I really can't decide. I have had a partner, my kid's father, who would regularly not show up home when he said he would and would go out drinking and  re appear  2 days later. When my first son was a baby I was pregnant with second son and on top of pregnancy sickness I got noro virus and was vomiting every 20 minutes and weak, pain headache, temperature. Baby was scared seeing me like that and i didn't want to leave him alone when I went downstairs to bathroom to vomit every 20 mins as he was screaming and it got really scary and I needed someone there. This is different because he would lie and just not show up at home regularly but I think in a supportive and loving relationship a partner wouldn't want you to feel like that alone. I wouldn't be able to enjoy myself knowing my partner was feeling like that. For me it's a red flag. But then I don't know your partners side to this. Cancelling his trip would make you TAH as this is about control and punishing him like a child and that's not going to help you. I don't think you should be together but you're clearly not ready to have that conversation. I think maybe NAHs here", "Don't throw good money after bad. 10 years doesn't matter more than 5 years. Can you count on him or not? Talk this through.", "NTA - cancel his ticket and dump him. He treated you so badly. Leaving you alone during a medical episode is a big no no. He\u2019s a lier and a bad partner, you needed help and he refused to give it. It\u2019s understandable why you didn\u2019t go to the party since partners don\u2019t always have to go to their partner\u2019s events. \n\nHave you had any thoughts about moving home or closer to friends? It would be good to have multiple plans in place in case of a really bad episode. I\u2019m sorry this happened to you and I hope you feel better soon!", "Imagine being a single woman and be sick, and then that\u2019s you. ESH", "ESH", "NTA definitely, who will you call if you are not well?\nI think about the trip, instead of cancelling the trip discuss everything, here his side of story & reach an agreement, the trip isn't the problem his behaviour was, so the problem needs to be discussed & sorted like adults.\nAfter that you can mutually decide if trip is a good idea or not, because a change of settings during difficult times in relationship could be helpful, NTA for sure.", "ESH why are you with a man who would still go to a party you aren\u2019t invited to? Why are you as his long term partner not invited to the party? Is it a guys-only thing or something? \n\nIt\u2019s obvious that is clouding your judgement. Your overboard reaction is an expression of unmet needs, not just from the one night.", "After reading the update, a firm NTA.\n\nHe's your only lifeline, and it sounds like you were having a migraine attack. I can relate because my husband has chronic migraines where he needs medication as well, and it is overall a scary experience.  If you weren't feeling well and you called to ask him to come home from a party, then he should have went home to be with you. Not lie and say that he will be home right away and then not show up for another two hours.\n\nYou also mentioned it was not the first time that he had done this. If that's the case, you are well within your right to cancel his ticket to the Bahamas because if he can't be there for you when you need him most, he shouldn't be rewarded with a trip.\n\nWith that said, if this has been a recurring pattern, and you've both been together for 10 years, maybe it's time to re-evaluate the relationship. Being in a relationship means being there for your partner through good and bad, because at the end of the day, you are trying to build a life with this person. They're supposed to be your partner through thick and thin. And reading this, it sounds like he's not as invested in being through thick and thin with you as you are with him.", "This!\n\nI hope OP answers. These were my questions too. Somethings missing here", "I have a feeling that flare-ups happen often when he's seeing his friends. His reaction indicates that this isn't the first time.\n\nOp seems controlling & likes to seek attention negatively by using illness. Threatening to cancel his ticket is borderline abusive. 'Do as I say, when I say it, or I'll take nice things away from you.'", "Enquiring minds need these answers.", "It\u2019s also worth asking if OP has a chronic condition\u2014like does this sort of thing happen? Or did OP just get the flu/food poisoning?\nI ask because if this isn\u2019t the first \u201cmedical episode\u201d there could be a whole pattern of dysfunctional behavior.", "Month isn't really \"old\" friends. In my book it's \"friends i see a lot, despite having adult life and responsibilities\"", "Definitly these questions, as well as how far away were his friends? Was he drinking? Was she expecting him to drive after having a few drinks? If they are far out in the country, getting an uber can take a while. Lots of context here. \n\nAlso a 13 hour triage at a hospital is kinda weird. I'd ask what sort of medical condition OP has that can cause both siezures, vomiting, and all of the other symptoms.", "Yeeah something not right here. I feel like maybe ESH. \n\nI think this is not the first time OP has tried to cut short his night out with friends. I also think this is not the first time OPs parter has abandoned her when she apparently needed him.

And my husband has never ever made me feel like a burden in the 10ish years we've been together.\n\nI can also definitely say that my husband would rather be home with me if I were having an intense flare up, and that he likely just wouldn't be with me if he couldn't handle it.\n\nOP's partner needs to make up his mind about their relationship, because it's not fair to OP if he's not actually in it.

Seems her \"illness\" may always appear when boyfriend is out.", "Emergency waits in my area are over 13+hrs to be triaged. Ambulances are sometimes not available for pick up.

He hangs out with us very, very, very rarely, maybe once every 2-3 months, and even then she calls or texts him every half hour. If we're getting together to watch a football game, the moment the game is over, she's already outside to pick him up.

If your partner is sick and needs comfort you'd rather they not bother you? Like you see it as borderline abusive for asking for comfort? If my partner is sick regardless of what Im doing,  if they are in pain, I dont want them to suffer alone. You think a party is more important than your partners emotional well being? Im not trying to be funny, it just seems like why be in a relatioship if you care so little for someone?\n\nI dont think we have enough info here. I see a lot of projection here.

Has your partner asked you to move so far away or do you have a legit reason to be there? Because the isolation and then ignoring you while you have a pretty serious medical episode seems a bit\u2026 wrong/off/concerning.", "Sometimes, I have random flare-ups that include chest pains.  I have medicine that sometimes stop them and sometimes doesn't. Once it was so bad, I couldn't breathe. I knew by that point emergency services were imminent. I waited until my hubby made it home from work and drove myself. (Not my brightest moment, but you live and learn) My point of sharing is that as someone who is chronically ill, you tend to get used to your illness. While it sounds horrible to other people, for us it becomes normal. That doesn't mean sometimes we don't need/want someone there to make sure the shenanigans don't escalate. That's part of the purpose of being in a relationship, to have someone you can depend on. I say screw the vacation, completely exit the relationship. NTA\n \n \u2022yet another chronically ill person", "Yeah. The longest ER wait time in the US is Maryland, with an average of 228 minutes. I'm really curious where OP is that it's over 3x that.", "Sounds right to me. Hospitals are understaffed. I've had family members at the hospital recently and they've waited 12 hours with no one seeing them.", "Kind of what I was thinking too. Also, the moment you vomit all over the waiting room I promise they will get you in somewhere.", "Spent 9 hours in triage with my kid suffering breathing difficulties. When she was finally seen she was taken straight to the PedICU when a bed opened up. When we\u2019ve gone subsequent times they take previous visits as a negative and make you wait longer because I\u2019m apparently overplaying her seriousness. Each time they seem surprised it\u2019s serious. \nWhen I was 16 my kidneys were failing. The public hospitals made me wait for hours, wasn\u2019t serious enough they said kids don\u2019t have renal failure they said. Thankfully my mum decided she was concerned enough to foot the bill for a private hospital. \nAnd I live in Aus with apparently a good healthcare system.", "Oh I missed that! Thank you for the correction :)", "Well I think she does need to leave him but taking him on a FAMILY trip that isn't his family when he can't even be there for her doesn't make sense. He doesn't need to be there. Make that make sense. Would YOU take someone who was treating you like crap to YOUR family trip? Kinda messed up.", "And do what? Oh let's just sit in the ER while I'm in misery \"in case\" I pass out or have a seizure? I know why I'm sick, so nothing you can do, I just need some eyes on me....that is not what the ER is for. She wanted him home IN CASE it got worse and she went from bad to unconscious and needing immediate medical help (and you can't call 911 if unconscious or having a seizure).", "He wasn't two hours late, he was two hours after she last heard from him which was a few hours after he said he'd leave. Not that I disagree with you though.", "She did - her partner. He was just a major asshole who thought getting drunk with his friends was more important than her health.", "True but due to the amount of calls the ambulance services get they might not be able to get to OP in time if they\u2019re having a serious episode. As for taxis they might be too far away or refuse to accept a sick passenger.", "Sorry I missed that, thanks :)", "I mean if she leaves him it makes sense to cancel the trip. If she paid for the ticket then it is her money. I don't see it as punishment. I see is as karma for being a bad partner. She isn't the AH. He doesn't deserve that trip in the end.", "oh i agree with that too. i see them as both the asshole and not the asshole (Schr\u00f6dinger's asshole if you will) In the beginning, i can see it as a YTA, but as they get to the point of severe panic, and dry heaving i see it as NTA. they would 100% be the asshole if they cancel a ticket over this, though", "Yeah and if he goes it will just be tension. I do think that since it is a pattern she should break up with him. It is obvious he doesn't care.", "I am pretty sure she has addressed it. It isn't a punishment if she just doesn't want him there because who the heck would? And maybe it does need to implode because it is obvious he doesn't need to be her partner.", "[deleted]", "Pray and hope your lucky enough that one is near by when you call and you get lucky or find an alternative way to get to a n e , doesn't help the ambulance and staff have to stay at the hospital with the previous patient so there can be 10 + plus ambulances and staff at a n e just waiting around for a patient to be triaged", "Paramedic here: right now everywhere ER\u2019s are over run with patients. 13 hour triage time could just mean the hospitals are over run and not enough nurses, or it could mean they triage low on the \u201crisk to die\u201d scale and sit in a waiting room for hours.", "Yeah that's fair, honestly if only if it's life or death will you be rushed through here, we don't really have urgent care unless it's one of the few that are done through insurance companies and if you went to an after hours gp likelihood is they'd say go into a&e as the pharmacies would be closed so if he over the counter meds weren't working it would be the only option \n\nI'd say judging by the edit it's something shes used to and avoids going to the hospital unless necessary but needs someone with her incase it gets that bad", "I\u2019m glad you said that, most people with chronic illness are able to handle things themselves. It\u2019s self preservation. My mom was a nurse so I was raised that the worst thing you could be is a dying swan as they call them. Advocate for yourself but \u201cthere, there\u201d hand holding could be nice but not necessary. \n\nAs soon as I read this post, all I could think of is how often this person is needy when the SO goes out. Also they had no intention of going to the hospital because they knew they would have to wait because it wasn\u2019t that big a deal.", "Hah. The UK definitely beats those numbers, and good luck getting an ambulance to show up here. Could be that OP isn't in the US.", "Possibly Canada. Long story short, in parts of Canada, conservative governments are choking out the public healthcare system on purpose to build a case for privatization. They have beem desperate to get rid of public healthcarelfor decades. They're underfunding, mistreating healthcare workers, the whole nine yards. 13+ hour wait times in ERs are common at the moment. It's unconscionable, completely preventable, but tragically it's true.", "Canada.", "I'm in Oregon and depending on the hospital, the wait can easily be over 6 hours.", "Facts. I was in John's Hopkins hospital 3 weeks ago for a week, and I waited 18 HOURS in emergency before I was actually seen by a doctor. Folks were coming into the emergency with SLEEPING BAGS, lunch coolers because apparently it's NORMAL to wait 10+ hours to be seen. They are short staffed, emergency had ONE doctor for hundreds of patients.", "What was the emergency, if I may ask? If you\u2019re waiting 12 hours in the ER it\u2019s because the triage nurse has assessed that you are not in as dire a straits as others waiting.", "Nah, we used to call housekeeping and tell them to use the emesis pan we gave them at check in.", "Her symptoms already were enough to present. In healthcare you want to prevent her going unconscious or having a seizure. Those are terrible things for the body and you want to prevent them. Please don\u2019t discourage people from going to the ER. Rigors, uncontrolled vomiting, weakness and previous having emergencies is all reason to present", "And she is an asshole for always relying on her husband when she needs comfort or is sick. What does she do when he is at work, out of town and so on? She needs to build a support system other then her husband and should have done that years ago since they lived there for 7 years. Husband is an asshole for lying about when he is back, but if this happens often and since she always relys on her husband to drop anything and run to her to comfort her I can understand he is annoyed. She needs to stop relying on her husband that much and he needs to actually stand to what he is saying. ESH", "And other than him? Who does she have?", "Upvote just for Schr\u00f6dinger's asshole.", "I'm 85% with you. Also kudos to Schr\u00f6dinger's asshole, lol.  Someone else had mentioned that if she really were in dire straits, why didn't she call someone else? This leads me to believe it wasn't nearly as serious if she hadn't tried alternate measures. The reason why I'm not going so hard on her partner is that I'm willing to bet the farm she's done this before. But hey, I could be assuming here and you know what they say about assuming, ha.", "I kind of assumed that a stern talking to would happen anyway. Resulting in either a breakup (agree with you that he doesnt seem to care and needs to go..) or a change in his behaviour. So then didnt assume the trip would still be awkward. But I can see your reasoning for that yes.\n\nI still think that throwing out the whole man is better than getting revenge by cancelling the ticket, just looking at future proceedings.. he wont change his ways or learn from the ticket being cancelled (u know what I mean by that?)", "You had me then lost me", "Yeah, both of my parents work in the medical field, so whenever I visit normally just how crazy things is a topic of discussion. I guess my point being here is that if there is something thats life threateningly serious, normally it will be triaged accordingly. At least here in the states, unless its pretty bad I'd rather go to an Urgent Care center than an ER (but even then our local ER wait times are nowhere near 13 hours). So context and location adds a lot of meaning to this.", "Yeah, my friend\u2019s elderly mum had a fall recently while my friend was out of town.  The carer found her and stayed with her until the ambulance came.  Friend drove back and found her mum still in the ambulance, parked outside the hospital, because A&E was full.  She was in the ambulance 8 hours and then in the waiting room another 5\u2026", "Oh f*** the conservatives.", "Agree. I've waited 8+ hours for a burn on my kid that wasn't urgent. (I'm still glad I took them, cos it pays to check and I'm no expert.) \n\nI've waited about 30 seconds when my anaphylaxis goes off. \n\nI've had paramedics arrive in less than 2 minutes to my house when my youngest was having a seizure. \n\nThey'll see the most urgent person.", "She has no one. OP said her family &friends live in a different time zone.", "thank you, Its such a fun applicable duel situational metaphor", "In a comment she states emergency services in her area take 13+ hours to triangulate, and ambulances are not always ready for pickup (meaning by the time OP got help, she could be in severe danger and critical state from siezures. that gives 18 minutes \\~ 3 hours wait time) and yeah, assuming makes an ass of u and me lol. She could have, or it could be the first time she was truly left unattended without her medicine working. i speak as someone with medical conditions myself that make it dangerous when i'm sick", "Oop sorry, thought you were OP", "But OP wasn't having seizures. She wants bf home in case she had a seizure. The medicine where not working but op still did not want medical help. Even after 3 hours?", "Not triangulate but 13+ to be waiting in triage at the hospital. Which suggests to me that it\u2019s not that urgent. If so, she\u2019d be triaged to be seen to much more quickly (usually).", "But she didn\u2019t want medical attention so the ambulance thing is a moot point she wanted comfort", "Understand the emergency services times. What I meant was calling a friend, another family member, a neighbor, etc. But I will concede you've made good points.", "lol no, OP has a funny blue mark", "[See my original comment, Not the comment thread here lol] I actually brought up counter-points with this user due to having friendly banter lol", "If its anything like the uk at the min even serious medical situations have a min 7 hr wait time ita horrendous here at the min a friends mum was run over last week head injury and broken jaw , 13 hrs before she got an x Ray and sewn up", "I'm aware, Please see my own original comment, as all this was was friendly banter", "Maybe her family lives out of town, and her friends are at work? (Which is possible), and she doesn't state where she lives, her neighbours could be miles out. so in either situation, it depends on who is truly the asshole based on info like this", "Not everyone has friends. With a disability or chronic condition it\u2019s kinda hard to make them\u2026 \n\nThe ablism in this thread is really heartbreaking.", "XD Yeah I misread and thought you said you made a comment before updating. Sorry sorry!", "Ok, that's reaching by a country mile, and throwing out \"ablism\" is lazy and incendiary at best. Do better.\n\nFurther, I've had medical emergencies on my own (without family or friends to help) and have learned to put plans in place in case I may need help. It's called being an adult.\n\nIf you read the entire post, there are many tells that OP is hardcore exaggerating the situation. Further if her condition was that dire, she'd have a plan in place.", "oh no its all good", "Could the plan in place be having a caring partner who will look out for you?\n\nWith that being said this is an unhealthy relationship that should end. Either she is genuinely sick and can't count on her partner, or she is exaggerating her illness and manipulating him. Whichever scenario is reality, this relationship is not working"]}
