The print itself isn\u2019t explicit at all, it\u2019s just a fully clothed guy in one side and the same guy, but topless, in another. I really like the dakimakura, my sleep has improved greatly since I got it, but it really pissed off my bf (23M).\n\nFirst he said that\u2019s it\u2019s an insane amount of money spent on a \u201cstupid pillow\u201d (it was only $100, which isn\u2019t a lot for this kind of thing). It sort of bugged me, since my bf is anything but stingy, but I just let it slide.\n\nThen he got annoyed with the character itself (he watched this anime as well), saying something along the \u201cwhy would you want to have a hug pillow with a half naked villain on\u201d, which I also brushed off. When he came over, he asked me to put the dakimakura away, stating that it makes him uncomfortable, and I just flipped it on the more modest side, which seemed to ease him a bit. After it, we got in a fight, he told me to either put the dakimakura away or to take the pillowcase off when he\u2019s over. I told him I absolutely won\u2019t do it since the dakimakura is huge and it\u2019s hard to put the pillowcase on/off. He told me that it\u2019s \u201cjust a stupid pillow\u201d, I responded with \u201cwell if it\u2019s just a stupid pillow, why would you instigate a fight over it\u201d, and so on.\n\nA couple days my dog fell asleep hugging the dakimakura, and I took a pic of it and sent it to a group chat (my bf isn\u2019t part of it, but some of our mutual friends are), joking something like \u201coh she\u2019s stealing my waifu\u201d. Someone must\u2019ve forwarded it to my bf, and he called me, demanding that I\u2019ll get rid of the dakimakura and saying that I \u201cdon\u2019t need no waifus since I have him\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable with you sleeping with another guy\u201d.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. This really annoyed me, and I told him that if he\u2019s THAT insecure to the point where he gets jealous of a literal fictional character who\u2019s canonically dead, he needs a therapist, not a gf. He started sulking and told me it\u2019s really mean to say something like that, I told him it\u2019s really mean to project your insecurities onto people who you seem to like. I ended the call, and he didn\u2019t call back or message me back.

Your partner is uncomfortable with it. If this story were flipped and he had some giant boobed anime lady on it, I don't think reddit would have any issue tearing him apart for it. The same should apply here.\n\nIt's not that having sexual kinks or fantasy items is bad, it's having them and insisting on them over your partner, which is the problem here. He feels this is a form of cheating, which is valid. Like with porn use, this is something that should be discussed openly with your partner so that both of you have an understanding as to what is ok within the boundaries of your relationship. That's going to require compromise. \n\nHim asking you to take off the pillowcase when he is over seems... honestly fine. \"Don't have your dildo/fleshlight/bodypillow/henti mags out on the bed when I'm over\" seems totally reasonable for either gender to ask.\n\nOr you break up. Which is probably will be what happens here as you treated his feelings like garbage here over your sex pillow.\n\nFinal vote is ESH. He was immature in his communication. But the lions share of blame here lies with you on this one.", "I mean I'd kind of cringe if I was dating a dude with a waifu pillow.

I\u2019m serious! \n\nMan had sexy anime body pillow he INSIST he should have. Has the topless side up naturally on the bed.

You all know what you would say if situations reversed.", "YTA.\n\nLet's be real here. A dakimakura is **not** just a pillow. If it were, you could get one of those long pregnancy pillows for a third of the price.\n\nA dakimakura is at best a decorative item with an image of a character you like, and at worst (for your boyfriend), an item that helps you engage in certain sexual fantasies.\n\nNow, I'm all for people having their own private sexual fantasies, even within the confines of a monogamous relationship. But I wouldn't be so blatant as to take a life-size image of a dude you fancy to the bed you share with your boyfriend, and then gaslight him about it.\n\nYes, I said gaslight.\n\nYou say one thing, but all your actions point to another.\n\nYou keep insisting that it's \"just a pillow\", but you call the guy your \"waifu\" to friends, jokingly or not. You keep insisting it's just a pillow, but in an effort to appease your boyfriend, you flip the dakimakura over so the more modest side is facing up.\n\nYour boyfriend's reaction is escalating because he can't make sense of what he's seeing (you sleeping wrapped around this pillow) with what he knows is true (a fictional character isn't a person). It's messing with his head and he deserves to explore these feelings with you, not just have them dismissed out of hand.\n\nIf I were to suggest something, I'd explore his feelings of being cheated on with an object. Does this mean you love him less? Or that you're less dependent on him for everything to do with a relationship (in that case, it can count as emotional cheating)?   \nOr is he simply insecure about possible character failings he feels he has, compared to the character on the dakimakura?\n\nAll these feelings deserve to be explored and dealt with, rather than belittled.", "YTA you can't decide between it's just a pillow and you can't sleep without out it.\n\nYou obviously have feelings about the pillow and what it represents, but you are telling your boyfriend he is not allowed to have feelings about it.\n\nAs for telling him he needs a therapist, you are the one who prefers to cuddle a pillow with a half naked man to a real man.", "YTA. Lots of people saying bf is jealous of a fictional character should probably be aware that it seems like bf isn't jealous of the character, but his gf's attachment to that character over and above him, to the point where OP is refusing to sleep without it even when her actual real bf is present. If that were me, I would feel rejected and upset by that.\n\nA dakimakura is, to my understanding, at the very least a simulated intimacy with a fictional character. If OP's bf had one with a girl character on it, which he refused to put away or stop using when OP was with him, I think the responses would be different. The point is that OP is sharing her intimacy with a pillow, when her bf is around. OP can do whatever she likes about that, but if bf doesn't agree then it's sensible to have an open conversation about what each person is okay with and agree together what to do going forward, rather than have OP refusing to change anything and paint the bf as unreasonable when his wishes aren't being considered at all.\n\nReally it comes down to whether you have it in you to put the effort in to have that discussion and be able to agree what is acceptable going forward. Right now it feels like you're not prepared to change anything about your behaviour, and throwing needing a therapist into someone's face is a nasty and unnecessary thing to be saying.", "Lol he needs a therapist?

Every argument he will make will make him seem insecure and controlling. If you dont want a boyfriend just dont have one. Let me guess, lets say you have sex and are finished, are you going back to your bodypillow which will prevent your bf to cuddle with you?   \n\n\nLike i said, this is an argument he will never win, or will never make him seem rational. Because the only thing you need to do is to play the \"are you insecure about a fictional character\" card. I dont care at all how much flak i get over this post but YTA, you bought a sexual fantasy pillow and then mock your bf for it.   \n\n\nI hope he finds someone who wants him, and not a fictional character \"that is canonically dead\", your words.", "I think I'll go with YTA here\n\nI don't think even a girl would celebrate if theyll see their bf sleeping with a daki of an ecchi girl lol. Ofc people here will claim they're not insecure etc but let's be real, there will still be a pang deep down inside.", "YTA although this sub will almost definitely take your side.\n\nFull disclosure I think anime is weird and I also think having a half naked cartoon on a pillow you can't sleep without is also weird.\n\nYour boyfriend is going a bit over the top with the jealously thing but I would also be a bit uncomfortable if my partner was carrying on like you with this pillow and refusing to put it away when I was at her house even though I asked.\n\nYou are being quite a big AH imo, not for getting the pillow though. If it makes him uncomfortable why can't you just put it in the closet when he is over? Are you that attached to the pillow with tye half naked cartoon? Also, sounds like you are basically threatening to break up with him over something really stupid which shows a lot of immaturity.\n\nETA: u/cottondragons said what I meant much better than me.", "ESH.
