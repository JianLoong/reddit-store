The print itself isn\u2019t explicit at all, it\u2019s just a fully clothed guy in one side and the same guy, but topless, in another. I really like the dakimakura, my sleep has improved greatly since I got it, but it really pissed off my bf (23M).\n\nFirst he said that\u2019s it\u2019s an insane amount of money spent on a \u201cstupid pillow\u201d (it was only $100, which isn\u2019t a lot for this kind of thing). It sort of bugged me, since my bf is anything but stingy, but I just let it slide.\n\nThen he got annoyed with the character itself (he watched this anime as well), saying something along the \u201cwhy would you want to have a hug pillow with a half naked villain on\u201d, which I also brushed off. When he came over, he asked me to put the dakimakura away, stating that it makes him uncomfortable, and I just flipped it on the more modest side, which seemed to ease him a bit. After it, we got in a fight, he told me to either put the dakimakura away or to take the pillowcase off when he\u2019s over. I told him I absolutely won\u2019t do it since the dakimakura is huge and it\u2019s hard to put the pillowcase on/off. He told me that it\u2019s \u201cjust a stupid pillow\u201d, I responded with \u201cwell if it\u2019s just a stupid pillow, why would you instigate a fight over it\u201d, and so on.\n\nA couple days my dog fell asleep hugging the dakimakura, and I took a pic of it and sent it to a group chat (my bf isn\u2019t part of it, but some of our mutual friends are), joking something like \u201coh she\u2019s stealing my waifu\u201d. Someone must\u2019ve forwarded it to my bf, and he called me, demanding that I\u2019ll get rid of the dakimakura and saying that I \u201cdon\u2019t need no waifus since I have him\u201d and that \u201cI\u2019m uncomfortable with you sleeping with another guy\u201d.\n\nThis is where I might be TA. This really annoyed me, and I told him that if he\u2019s THAT insecure to the point where he gets jealous of a literal fictional character who\u2019s canonically dead, he needs a therapist, not a gf. He started sulking and told me it\u2019s really mean to say something like that, I told him it\u2019s really mean to project your insecurities onto people who you seem to like. I ended the call, and he didn\u2019t call back or message me back.

Your partner is uncomfortable with it. If this story were flipped and he had some giant boobed anime lady on it, I don't think reddit would have any issue tearing him apart for it. The same should apply here.\n\nIt's not that having sexual kinks or fantasy items is bad, it's having them and insisting on them over your partner, which is the problem here. He feels this is a form of cheating, which is valid. Like with porn use, this is something that should be discussed openly with your partner so that both of you have an understanding as to what is ok within the boundaries of your relationship. That's going to require compromise. \n\nHim asking you to take off the pillowcase when he is over seems... honestly fine. \"Don't have your dildo/fleshlight/bodypillow/henti mags out on the bed when I'm over\" seems totally reasonable for either gender to ask.\n\nOr you break up. Which is probably will be what happens here as you treated his feelings like garbage here over your sex pillow.\n\nFinal vote is ESH. He was immature in his communication. But the lions share of blame here lies with you on this one.", "I mean I'd kind of cringe if I was dating a dude with a waifu pillow.

I\u2019m serious! \n\nMan had sexy anime body pillow he INSIST he should have. Has the topless side up naturally on the bed.

You all know what you would say if situations reversed.", "YTA.\n\nLet's be real here. A dakimakura is **not** just a pillow. If it were, you could get one of those long pregnancy pillows for a third of the price.\n\nA dakimakura is at best a decorative item with an image of a character you like, and at worst (for your boyfriend), an item that helps you engage in certain sexual fantasies.\n\nNow, I'm all for people having their own private sexual fantasies, even within the confines of a monogamous relationship. But I wouldn't be so blatant as to take a life-size image of a dude you fancy to the bed you share with your boyfriend, and then gaslight him about it.\n\nYes, I said gaslight.\n\nYou say one thing, but all your actions point to another.\n\nYou keep insisting that it's \"just a pillow\", but you call the guy your \"waifu\" to friends, jokingly or not. You keep insisting it's just a pillow, but in an effort to appease your boyfriend, you flip the dakimakura over so the more modest side is facing up.\n\nYour boyfriend's reaction is escalating because he can't make sense of what he's seeing (you sleeping wrapped around this pillow) with what he knows is true (a fictional character isn't a person). It's messing with his head and he deserves to explore these feelings with you, not just have them dismissed out of hand.\n\nIf I were to suggest something, I'd explore his feelings of being cheated on with an object. Does this mean you love him less? Or that you're less dependent on him for everything to do with a relationship (in that case, it can count as emotional cheating)?   \nOr is he simply insecure about possible character failings he feels he has, compared to the character on the dakimakura?\n\nAll these feelings deserve to be explored and dealt with, rather than belittled.", "YTA you can't decide between it's just a pillow and you can't sleep without out it.\n\nYou obviously have feelings about the pillow and what it represents, but you are telling your boyfriend he is not allowed to have feelings about it.\n\nAs for telling him he needs a therapist, you are the one who prefers to cuddle a pillow with a half naked man to a real man.", "YTA. Lots of people saying bf is jealous of a fictional character should probably be aware that it seems like bf isn't jealous of the character, but his gf's attachment to that character over and above him, to the point where OP is refusing to sleep without it even when her actual real bf is present. If that were me, I would feel rejected and upset by that.\n\nA dakimakura is, to my understanding, at the very least a simulated intimacy with a fictional character. If OP's bf had one with a girl character on it, which he refused to put away or stop using when OP was with him, I think the responses would be different. The point is that OP is sharing her intimacy with a pillow, when her bf is around. OP can do whatever she likes about that, but if bf doesn't agree then it's sensible to have an open conversation about what each person is okay with and agree together what to do going forward, rather than have OP refusing to change anything and paint the bf as unreasonable when his wishes aren't being considered at all.\n\nReally it comes down to whether you have it in you to put the effort in to have that discussion and be able to agree what is acceptable going forward. Right now it feels like you're not prepared to change anything about your behaviour, and throwing needing a therapist into someone's face is a nasty and unnecessary thing to be saying.", "Lol he needs a therapist?

Every argument he will make will make him seem insecure and controlling. If you dont want a boyfriend just dont have one. Let me guess, lets say you have sex and are finished, are you going back to your bodypillow which will prevent your bf to cuddle with you?   \n\n\nLike i said, this is an argument he will never win, or will never make him seem rational. Because the only thing you need to do is to play the \"are you insecure about a fictional character\" card. I dont care at all how much flak i get over this post but YTA, you bought a sexual fantasy pillow and then mock your bf for it.   \n\n\nI hope he finds someone who wants him, and not a fictional character \"that is canonically dead\", your words.", "I think I'll go with YTA here\n\nI don't think even a girl would celebrate if theyll see their bf sleeping with a daki of an ecchi girl lol. Ofc people here will claim they're not insecure etc but let's be real, there will still be a pang deep down inside.", "YTA although this sub will almost definitely take your side.\n\nFull disclosure I think anime is weird and I also think having a half naked cartoon on a pillow you can't sleep without is also weird.\n\nYour boyfriend is going a bit over the top with the jealously thing but I would also be a bit uncomfortable if my partner was carrying on like you with this pillow and refusing to put it away when I was at her house even though I asked.\n\nYou are being quite a big AH imo, not for getting the pillow though. If it makes him uncomfortable why can't you just put it in the closet when he is over? Are you that attached to the pillow with tye half naked cartoon? Also, sounds like you are basically threatening to break up with him over something really stupid which shows a lot of immaturity.\n\nETA: u/cottondragons said what I meant much better than me.", "ESH.

A pillow with an anime is a sexual object? Kim press the button, no hope for humans. So a full size poster of a 2D character is a sexual object? Buying the manga? I am laughing so hard my spleen will split. And you think a normal woman would have an issue with someone having a pillow with an anime girl? Maybe some crazy insecure immature 12yo.... Oh yes I remember a girl, who was angy why her bf had anime stickers on his game console. Please find and start a club \"we are jealous of manga and anime 2d characters, reading is cheating\" \ud83e\udd23", "I expected the top comment to be bashing OPs (ex)boyfriend, but to actually find a reasonable and well structured opinion, that's unexpected. I agree 100% though. I could maybe get it if the pillow was around before the boyfriend. But buying it while already being in a relationship?\nThat's just bad taste.\n\nI don't think this is a question of insecurity. Imagine your SO suddenly puts a large photo of a partially undressed Magic Mike/Mia Khalifa (idk, the first names I could think of) on their wall and expects you to be fine with it. Anyone would be upset so BF's reaction, though overly extreme and not well handled by him, is understandable.", "I completely agree with this and think OP is the AH but just so you know, because you have put YTA in your comment, the bot will count that as a vote.", "I'd still say it's a pillow. If someone is jealous of a pillow, that someone has a problem.", "Precisely.  The implication here from other responses is that jealousy makes him the bad guy.  But it's literally something he has to wake up to daily.  I think you're entitled to feel a bit jealous when it's in your own bed, even if it is a fictional character that wasn't discussed ahead of time.", "Exactlyyyy", "It\u2019s him who insists it\u2019s just a pillow, for me it\u2019s a sort of comforting item, nothing feels as great as snuggling up to a pillow with your favourite character on after a particularly hard day", "I don't think most people would be jealous I think most people would be embarrassed.", "A bed is a shared, sacred space and both partners should agree on what takes place there.", "\u201canime is weird\u201d look all for your opinions and all but how can an entire submedium be considered weird if it varies a lot in style?", "I don't know if it was ment qs an insult or more like \"ah I see you got big problems, you are projecting onto me, please get therapy for that\" kind of way, like a sincere hope that he gets help.

Is it some kind of sex pillow? I thought it was just a corny fandom pillow. This changed my answer. Also, I feel old and out of touch \ud83d\ude02", "The bf was the one saying \"its just a pillow\" 1st. She just used it herself to counter his argument.", "Don't throw out normal body pillows with the cringe sex ones. \n\nI am a side sleeper and a body pillow helps me sleep a lot. But it's just a regular one with a regular pillow case on it.", "Flip the genders for a moment, imagine she finds him with a half naked waifu pillow that he sleeps cuddled up with and refuses to put it away even when she's staying in the same bed. Would it be fine for him to do it and dismiss OP's feelings the same way?", "Ikr? people agreeing with him need help, its not normal to be that insecure...", "I freaking love hisoka, lol.", "Not even close lol", ">its hisoka isnt it\n\nUnderstandable. But how could you go to sleep with Hisoka  there?", "I actually toyed with this idea before! I\u2019m also a part of the furry community, my bf is just interested in them, he\u2019s even got a fursona. I really wanted to commission a daki case with my fursona on, maybe even one that\u2019s more explicit, but I eventually left this idea since it could be weird for him to sleep with a drawn half-naked doggo that represents his gf", "The sex life is actually a bit complicated between us, since I have a very strong opinion on premarital intimacy, but he\u2019s okay with my decision. We actually have a pretty stable relationship, although he\u2019s more on a normie side, and I\u2019m just, well, me lol, but we get along pretty good (apart from the waifu pillow thing)", "Privileged af over here", "Yeah, it\u2019s a game changer for me since I have troubles falling asleep (thanks ADHD)\n\nIt\u2019s Itachi from Naruto!", "Cheating... with a pillow? Thats not ridiculous to you? You cant be serious...", "Its a pillow lmfao Bf needs to relax", "It my husband had a body pillow with a topless woman I wouldn't be impressed, cartoon or not \n\n\nI just think it's trashy", "I helped my hubby pick out a daki awhile ago just for some humor- we're both impish little pests about sex with each other and pretty open about it. He doesn't even have it in bed, but that might be because we already have two body pillows and several Ikea plushies in bed and our mattress is small lol. But it was a fun exercise! We both have our anime crushes, and don't think it's something to be ashamed of. And it supported a small artist so win win!", "Yikes! Projecting much?", "It\u2019s not his own bed, it\u2019s mine, and I think I\u2019m supposed to have the final word on what belongs to my room and what doesn\u2019t.", "And you think he needs therapy?", "Not even snuggling up to your boyfriend?", "If it was a body pillow with no print on it he would be fine with it, so it's really quite ridiculous to be jealous of a pillow.", "Youre fkn funny XD\n\nAlso they don't live together as she said \"When he came over\".", "Just find it weird I guess.\n\nBut listen I have hobbies that other people would consider weird as well im sure.\n\nI just wanted to disclose that because it likely adds a bias to my answer.", "OP's comments clearly indicate they said that because they were upset.", "Ah I haven't seen that reply.\n\nIf she is truly fine with it that okay fair point, but btw I'm also pretty sure u don't need to have an anime dakimakura? Like if he had a celebrity crush pillow, idk maybe ariana grande, miley cyrus, that female main character from high school musical on the pillow in swimwear or something a little bit revealing would OP still be fine with that?\n\nI mean if the comfort item is something different would that change her view on it? Like a teddy he got from a female friend. Maybe an accessory like a braclet or something he likes to wear. Would she be okay with him keeping that in front of OP?\n\nidk i feel like i need more input from both of them, is he against OP liking anime stuff or buying more of it in general? Do they fight about more than that. Why did the friend in the group chat send it to OPs bf in private so he knows of that picture?", "Depends, some people may use it like that, but its not its intent or purpose. And OP stated that she isnt using it as such.\n\nIts most people projecting their own insecurities onto OP, kinda similar to her BF...", "Ah yes, I thought all body pillows were cringy sex ones, must be a language issue.

As OP said it's not a lot of money for something like that.", "that was absolutely not who i was expecting lmao", "You clearly don't give a fuck about this guy so why don't you just break up with him and go back to the cartoon on your pillow?", "Translation: - I value a fake characters chest more than my partners emotions. YTA.", "You absolutely have the final word on what goes in your bed. Your boyfriend has the final word on whether he wants to be part of that. \n\nI recently called someone the AH for suggesting her boyfriend should man up and get rid of his teddy bears.

But it shouldn't be dismissed.", "Of course you do, but don't expect him to accept that.  Relationships are a two way street.  You probably just need to find someone who doesn't mind.", "No, you must listen to these confident manly man, who are so manly and confident that you having a pillow with a dude on it, in your own private room completely shatters them.\n\nHow dare a lowly woman like yourself have a say in your personal belongings?

I already voted ESH anyways.", "Then again, his tipping point was her saying her dog was stealing her waifu as a joke.

It takes confidence to voice your discomforts to your partner btw especially for a man.", "No one's arguing that she can't have autonomy over her own belongings.  It's just that it's unfair to expect him to blindly accept that without question.

He raised a concern he has over his partners reliance on pillow of a semi naked character. Most rational people believe this to be a pretty reasonable concern. Is OP allowed to have it? Of course yes but that doesn\u2019t make the boyfriends feelings invalid. And to suggest the boyfriend has a fragile masculinity because he has voiced his discomfort feeds into the very real perceptions of masculinity that claims the lives of men every day.", "You realize you\u2019re the one who made it about gender right? \n\nIt has nothing to do with that.

It is in fact irrational to be jealous of a fictional character. No licenced psychologist will tell you its rational.", "Oh because it's completely rational to be so obsessed with a fictional character that you need a pillow with their face on to sleep so you can pretend that they exist and they're sleeping with you?\n\nThat is not normal. It's not healthy. It's obsession at best and delusion at worst. OP needs help, like yesterday."]}
