Him being opposed to the guy being around your son at all is worrying, was the ex abusive towards your son as well?\n\nYTA\n\nOverall, I'm getting the impression that you and/or your son were abused, and your brother is angry because you let the abuser into the house. Part of the anger may be due to someone he trusted doing this to you. If I'm way off the mark, you may need to give us some kind of context.\n\nAdditionally, you knew your ex wouldn't be welcome in the house, because your SIL outright told you this. Bringing the guy into their home against their wishes like this is an asshole move.

My brother was out when he came over but my sister-in-law was home and she kept telling me he wouldn\u2019t like it when he found out. I think she called him because he came home early and he knew before he even saw my ex. He told my ex to get out of his house and to stay away from me and forget he had a son. My ex refused but I made him go as their arguing was upsetting my son.\n\nOnce he left and my son had calmed down, my brother turned his anger on me. He thinks I\u2019m insane for asking my ex to come and see our son as he thinks I need to stay away from him until our divorce is finalized. He told me he didn\u2019t want him in his house again and wouldn\u2019t budge when I reminded him he\u2019s still my son\u2019s father.

Kids get viruses and can be very sick but going to the doctor is a waste of all resources because nothing can be done except for the doctor to tell the parent to give fluids and combat extreme fever.", "> If he's too sick to go to a park then he should be at a doctors office.\n\nwhat??????? this is absolutely not true", "Kid has a stomach bug, he isn't immobile, and I was speaking more generally, if you don't want to have when you can meet your kid dictated to you, then dont have him stay in someone elses house.", "\"im not a victim of abuse\"\n\n\"yes you are you dumb lying bitch!!!!!!!!\"\n\nis basically the vibe of this comment section", "To be honest, I still don't think it's 100% off the table that he was abusive. Lots of women in these situations minimize abuse. \n\nWhat we do know is that she minimized the fact that he was an intruder from the moment  he was asked to leave and refused to do so. Unless OP is abducting her child and the *brother is in the wrong and the ex is panicking over the loss of his kid, BIL has the right to be freaked out and say what he needs to get the ex the fuck off his property.", "Perhaps Ex is doing the best he can and OP doesn\u2019t work. Things have nuance. The blame is not always on the shoulders of the man when it comes to money. This is gross thinking. The brother is clearly an ass for what he said to OPs ex. The end.", "OP you're being extremely cagey, which makes me suspect your brother is in the right here.", "Abuse isn't just physical.", "Abusive doesn't just mean physical abuse, it also means emotional and psychological abuse which is just as serious. So with this in mind, was he abusive? Because the way your brother is acting and \"helped me leave him\" sounds like he may not have lift a finger towards you and your son but he might have done the abuse in other forms. Abuse doesn't just equal beatings, punches or slaps. It can also mean controlling behavior, around where you both went, who you talked to, what you did in the house, what you had access to regarding food/drink/amenities/basic clothes and necessities. With this in mind. Was your husband abusive? Towards you? Towards your son? Both?", "There are many kinds of abuse...", "You're largely right. Up until the point where OP starts putting others in danger. If op is DA survivor, mental/physical, then it's no longer about op once you involve your child and your brother/SIL. Way too many instances of friends and family being killed in similar situations and worse. It's not fair to OP but equally not fair to everyone else.", "Has he threatened you or your family?", "You are being vague for a reason and you know your brother is right and that YTA", "The child did not NEED their father, the child wanted/asked for their father. \n\nAlso, access to a child does not equate to access to someone else\u2019s home.", "INFO: This really comes down to the reason for your divorce and why your brother hates him so much. Any votes without having that information aren't based on enough information. If the divorce is messy because of infidelity or just because it didn't work out and one of you is unhappy about the divorce, you're not the asshole and everyone saying your brother has an absolute right to dictate who he has in his house is crazy for thinking that it's okay to keep a father from his child (barring the possible missing reasons).\n\nHowever, if you're ex is dangerous, abusive, predatory, violent, etc. then I think you're the asshole.", "the way people are calling OP a liar and insisting she MUST be a domestic violence victim is pretty wild", "I never comment on these but I was dumbfounded to see how far I had to scroll to find the NTA answer. So many people are ignoring that the child is sick and not considering that we don't even know of the ex being let in the house was a boundary that was clearly communicated. He is the father of this guy's nephew after all. Unless there is a history of abuse (which we don't have confirmed) he has a right to see his son.", "Access to the child doesn\u2019t mean access to a household, especially a third party\u2019s household.", "Yes obviously lol. Access to a child not some other persons home."]}
