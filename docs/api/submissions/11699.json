My brother was out when he came over but my sister-in-law was home and she kept telling me he wouldn\u2019t like it when he found out. I think she called him because he came home early and he knew before he even saw my ex. He told my ex to get out of his house and to stay away from me and forget he had a son. My ex refused but I made him go as their arguing was upsetting my son.\n\nOnce he left and my son had calmed down, my brother turned his anger on me. He thinks I\u2019m insane for asking my ex to come and see our son as he thinks I need to stay away from him until our divorce is finalized. He told me he didn\u2019t want him in his house again and wouldn\u2019t budge when I reminded him he\u2019s still my son\u2019s father.
