This is our first serious relationship, and we're both 22 years old. We just returned from our two-week vacation, and she mentioned that my behavior of ignoring her bothered her quite a bit. During our outings, we would spend the entire day outside and then return to the hotel room after dinner, usually around 8:30 PM. Once in the room, I would play with my Nintendo Switch while she watched TV. Unfortunately, most of the time there wasn't anything interesting on TV. She would try to get my attention by touching or talking to me, but I would often respond with brief replies like \"Okay\" or \"Yes/No\" or ask her to give me a moment. Essentially, I was ignoring her while playing my Switch.\n\nWhen she brought this issue up, I told her that this was my \"me\" time and I wasn't willing to give it up just because she was bored. Surprisingly, even her brother (25M) sided with me when she discussed it with him. However, since this is my first serious relationship, I'm unsure about whether I'm in the wrong here.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit :\n\n1. I want to add that I spent the entire day (9am to 8pm) with her. I just need some \"Me\" time to unwind. I only played for like 1hr\n2. Alot of people mentioned sexy time. There is no sexy time involved.

BUT only because it seems that you didn't communicate with her that you needed some time to decompress from a long day of physical/social activities.

She could have mentioned it in the trip so maybe it would change or you\u2019d both understand each other.  Best of luck to you two", "NAH\n\nI need to unwind if I spend a whole day out too. You just gotta work on communication! Let her know that your brain needs to switch off for a bit after a big outing, that it's nothing personal and you're sorry if you made her feel unwanted.\n\nHer job as your partner is to then be understanding of your limits and support you in them.\n\nMy husband and I are thankfully matched in that haha. Our kids are too. We all have an unspoken agreement that after big days out we'll all be together but silently and doing our own things. It's very normal behaviour!", "Not exactly TA but sound like a poor communicator and a bit socially unaware. \n\nI am an introvert, and if I don\u2019t recharge with alone time/time where I shut off my brain after being social for hours/days on end I actually get physically ill. My nervous system says \u201cif you won\u2019t stop we will make you\u201d and I end up in bed with a psychogenic fever. It\u2019s annoying as hell, but because of this I have to communicate to people what I can and cannot commit to. \n\nYou can do this without \u201cI\u2019m not giving this up just because you\u2019re bored.\u201d  that\u2019s rude and maybe she wasn\u2019t so much bored as she was feeling insecure that you mentally ghosted without explanation. \n\nA good alternative would be \u201cI\u2019m so excited I get to spend the days with you, but since I\u2019m a huge introvert I\u2019m going to burn out if I don\u2019t get down time. I was thinking this type of schedule might work: did you want to negotiate?\u201d \n\nThen maybe she would have suggested you take some quiet mornings so you could spend an evening with her. \n\nCommunication is key here", "INFO: How much time did you spend playing the switch each day?  If she\u2019d wanted to leave the room to go do something by herself while you played, was that a realistic option?", "NAH. You both should have communicated more clearly about your expectations. But I\u2019m fully on your side, I would be absolutely *exhausted* and need some time to myself after being out and about, busy and socializing for 11 hours in a day no matter how much I love my partner.", "You're NTA for needing to have some alone time to decompress. However, YTA for how you went about getting it.", "NTA wanting some me time but definitely TA for how you handled it. You needed to discuss it and not just brush her off. Did you tell her you wanted some time then offer to do something with her after? Probably would have helped", "NTA. Idk how all these YTA ppl would spend all day with their partner without having a lil break for themselves. You had an hour to yourself and I think that's fine. Maybe its because you're playing video games so it seemed like you don't care. Next time communicate with her. Tell her you need some downtime.", "N T A for wanting \"me time\", but YTA for how you handled it. From the way you describe it, it sounds like it was pretty clear she wanted more of your attention the first night it happened. If that's the case, you should have communicated your need for \"me time\" to her instead of brushing her off/ignoring her. \"Hey, I'm really enjoying our vacation together, but I'm also pretty worn out by the end of the day. I'd really like some time to unwind with my games each night.\" Then from there you might need to compromise if she wants time with you that's not out in public. But, that compromise doesn't have to mean less \"me time\" for you. It could mean doing a little less during the day, coming back to the hotel for a couple hours before dinner for \"me time\" and then spending after dinner together. Or maybe she doesn't even need a compromise and just needs to know what's going on with you so she doesn't feel ignored. Point being, YTA for the lack of communication.", "Info: did you explain to her that you need a little time to yourself most days, before the trip? Or did you wait until she brought up this issue?", "NTA, it's ridiculous for her to expect your full undivided attention while she's also got some other distraction going, meaning if she found interesting TV she would have ignored you!", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to some \u201cme\u201d time.\n\nIf your gf cannot amuse herself for an hour, that may be something to consider moving forward\u2026", "YTA, if she's communicating her frustration with you ignoring her you should have adjusted your behavior, especially on a vacation when she's expecting to spend time with her partner. I understand you were likely communicating all day and wanted to relax a bit but you can definitely play some video games and give more than yes/no answers.\n\nThe switch is also a great console to play with two people. Get some multiplayer games and see if she'll play them with you for next time. \n\nYou should apologize and make it up to her somehow in my opinion.", "NTA. I would hardly call small periods of some \"me\" time in the evening after spending all day with one's partner ignoring them. It isn't uncommon for people to need some time to refocus and have a little space", "[deleted]", "YTA. At age 22, the last thing I would be doing with an SO in a hotel room is video games. Actually at any age.", "I hope you do understand you are begging to be dumped as a result of this behavior.", "YTA\n\nWhat's the point of going on vacation together if you're gonna ignore them? Why were you even in the room?\n\nWhen I'm on vacation the room im renting is for three things; sleeping, bathing and fucking. Otherwise I'm out doing stuff on vacation. Otherwise I could just sit at home.", "I get what you are trying to say. You needed an unwind moment. Something to chill and break from the day.  \n\nBut kn this case YTA - it seemed like what she wanted was some romance and sexy times. What you wanted was some me time. We all need our me time. But next time- do it differently. Take a shower then ask her to take a walk to the beach or whatever. Or watch a funny show together.  \n\nAlso try to schedule differently if you need some down time. As she seems to want something different.  \n\nBUT the big point is communicate. 2 weeks is a long time to have not talked about it. It's not about the gaming or me time it's about expectations.

You\u2019re rude and dismissive of her feelings.", "Yta. If you want \"you\" time, stay single. The issue isn\u2019t you were playing, it\u2019s that you did it every single day.
