Focus on your own grief and deal with it. Sounds to me like you're doing what a lot of people do. Deciding to 'do' rage and anger rather than dealing with the cold reality of your mother's death.

Grief is strange creature, and hits everyone differently. There is not a right or wrong way to grieve. Your mom\u2019s funeral was not about you or your dad, or how you feel about your dad.

You lost control.", "Going against the grain to say ESH. Grieving can explain his behavior (and yours) but it can\u2019t excuse it. He was an AH when you went to visit him, you were an AH at the funeral. Clearly there\u2019s a lot of history and hard feelings there that are probably too long for Reddit, and I\u2019m sure that your past with him would explain things a bit more. I think it\u2019s unfair for people to render a Y T A judgement based on your dad grieving, and not taking into account that you\u2019re grieving as well.

You asked us.", "That's not how grief works, in fact most people I know grieve by themselves and do not show their grief in front of others, undoubtedly why your dad wished to be alone.

Father is not the only one grieving", "lol what\nnext time i grieve i will tell my daughter she will also be dead soon since its ok to do that lol \njust kidding i love my kid unlike the dad in this scenario", "No, not when the dad tells the OP, they are going to die like their mom.", "The dad's actions didn't occur at the funeral. OP had plenty of time to compose themself for seeing him there.", "I'd say that's at best a possibility, not a certainty.  Dad screamed angrily at OP for disturbing him and told him he'd die like his mom, then later at the funeral said he'd been exhausted by supporting the grief of his children when he'd patently done the opposite. I'd say there's nothing Dad did that you attribute to grief that couldn't just as easily be attributed to assholery."]}
