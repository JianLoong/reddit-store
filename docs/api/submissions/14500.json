I didn\u2019t know that she didn\u2019t know about the tarot thing until she walked in to my room while I was doing a reading last week. I usually do one before bed as kind of a wind down.

That kind of invasion of privacy is not okay.  \n\nThere are some tarot sets on Amazon for around $10.

Get an ouija board.", "NTA - and it\u2019s brilliant.", "NTA, I\u2019m going to echo a few comments I see here but ask your dad for a lock, that woman has no boundaries and no right to control you.", "NTA - So your dad's new wife just trespassed into your room and destroyed your personal property?  Sounds like a crime to me.\n\nI love your retribution strategy and how she did it to herself (that's like the icing on the cake!), keep it up!  She's already a crazy criminal, might as well have fun with it.  \n\nYou unfortunately have at least 3 more years of her before you can run from that household, so buckle up and make it interesting, especially since your dad clearly showed who's side he's on after being presented with a crime his new wife just committed.", "NTA. And honestly\u2026. I am absolutely dying at you remaking the cards to hide around. She had no right to mess with your things and your dad is enabling her. I\u2019m 100 percent calling karma on the necklace thing (I\u2019m v spiritual myself and I believe in the power of words/the mind). If you can get over her burning your stuff, she can get over this weird devil worship idea she has going on. \n\nOn another note, I\u2019m really sorry about your deck.

What surprises me the most, is the \"Christians\" are the ones that believe in it. \n\nSo, you believe in a God that's got your back. You go to church and pray and have faith. Why would a person put a curse on you? Because you believe in it! And also believe that everybody else is a sinner that's gonna burn in hell and they're out to get you! It's fantastic! \n\nOh, and before I forget, some churches mention the devil more than they mention God. \n\nNTA. I applaud you OP. Tell your dad to buy you a set of cards, a door lock, and you'll go easy on his wife.", "Omg OP TOTALLY NTA. Or at the very least an extremely justified AH. I would take it up a notch, honestly. Get some colored contacts, paint your nails black, start growling at her. Keep it small and harmless.

Obviously she shouldn't have burned them. However you should know people get real touchy about this stuff. I had a friend who was a professional psychic and he told me that you should only use carrot cards that have been given to you? Tbh he could have just been messing with me, I'd fully believe that.
