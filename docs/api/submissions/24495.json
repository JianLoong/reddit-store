Me and Aubrey were never married and split 8 years ago whenever Claire was 1.5 years old. \n\nWe have split custody and trade each Sunday. Just to provide context me and Aubrey dated for 2 years before she got pregnant. We decided move in together but had very different lifestyle ideas. Since we started dating she talked about being a stay at home mom. I told her countless times I didn\u2019t want 1 income. Whenever our daughter was born we started fighting about her going back to nursing. She refused and said she didn\u2019t want to work. Eventually we split up after her saying that I \u201cwasn\u2019t mature enough\u201d to handle a family. But overall we do co parent well. Like we do family dinners on Sundays and go on trips together. Hell we even help each other with babysitting, sports teams travel and shopping. We do a great job together and I think our daughter appreciates us being on each others team so much. I\u2019d consider us good friends. She started dating someone a few months after we split and I met him whenever they moved in together. They dated for a few years and got engaged but have since separated and I was the one who helped her move out. Just trying to explain we are very good with each other typically. \n\nThe last 2 weeks aubrey has been staying in my guest room. Her house was getting some updates done and she asked to stay with me (she\u2019s no longer with her finance so she bought a new place). I let her and she told me to act like she wasn\u2019t there and just do my thing. It was also more time with my daughter so I saw no issue with it. My bedroom is attached to the back deck of my house. On Thursday I had a lady friend come over around 11 and stay the night and leave by 7. I\u2019ve done this countless times with my daughter home and she\u2019s never woken up. This lady friend specifically has been over multiple times the last few months. She\u2019s a nurse at the same hospital as Aubrey so she works odd hours so this is normal. \n\nI took Claire to a camp Friday morning and whenever I got home aubrey was fuming. She said she heard my guest come in last night and was disgusted. Saying that I needed to set a better example for my daughter and how dangerous it was to sneak random people in my house. I said she needed to check herself. As she is a guest and has no say of what I do in my home. She said other things that I can\u2019t remember as I was starting to tune her out but finally said something about it being bad for my daughter. I said \u201cyou know what\u2019s probably not good for Claire. You moving her in with random dudes and then breaking up. I\u2019m not moving her home anywhere like you have. I simply have guest over and she\u2019s never once noticed. So fuck right off with that.\u201d. \n\nAubrey then said something about how I needed to grow up. Aubrey and me have been staying away from each other. And I\u2019m thinking about asking her to get a hotel room as I\u2019m done with her shit about this. I\u2019m a grown ass man and can do what I want.

The problem is the sneaking in. A child\u2019s home should be their safe place, and when you sneak people in without their knowledge you take that safety feeling from them. You put strangers (to them) on their safe territory. She is 10, she knows that there is someone else there. Is she gonna cross with the person if she goes to the kitchen? To the bathroom? Doesn\u2019t matter if your friend never leaves your bedroom, your daughter won\u2019t know that. \n\nI don\u2019t judge you for wanting to separate your sex life from your family. Not introducing someone you don\u2019t have a relationship with to your daughter. It makes sense. But then I beg you to only see your friend when your daughter is not home or go to an outside place. Or just introduce her as a friend that sleeps in sometimes, some kids are very understanding of different kinds of relationships, specially nowadays. \n\nBut in the end, is this the example you wanna set to your daughter? That if she wants to have a sex partner (or any partner) they should sneak in and not be introduced to you? \n\nYou went too hard on the mom, and I think you know that her relationship had a very different weight than the one you have with your friend.

That you turned it around on her to suggest that having a long term monogamous relationship and engagement that ended for whatever reason is worse than what you\u2019re doing is incredibly immature. \n\nCongrats on kissing your good coparenting relationship goodbye.", "esh - you're in the right, but your response was needlessly cruel and could have bad effects on your coparening relationship / daughter going forward", "NTA... your visitor is discreet and not all that random.

Your ex is right, you have a responsibility as a parent to set good examples for your child and to be safe.  You can bang your fuck buddy whenever your child isn\u2019t there but sneaking her in is tacky and potentially unsafe.  And your ex has the right to be concerned about what/who her daughter may be exposed to.  You need to grow up.  You may think your child has never woken and noticed but that doesn\u2019t make it true.  Children are smarter and more perceptive than adults give them credit for being.  She will eventually notice.  You are not a single, childless person anymore, you are a parent.", "NTA\n\nUltimately you want to do what is best for your daughter. You and ex should work this out. You are a grown ass man. She's a grown ass woman. This is crap about not having someone over as long as you are being discrete.

Sex and dating aren't a problem, but he needs to introduce his friend to his daughter in an age-appropriate way, not sneak around.", "Yes it is, and yeah she\u2019s not a significant relationship, she\u2019s a fuck buddy.  I hope you don\u2019t have kids.  Stability is important and sneaking some casual woman over for sex is not healthy for a household with young children.  He needs to care more about his child and less about his dick.", "the difference is that the child won't run into her and have a stranger unexpectedly in their house. It hasn't happened yet but it could. If he just told the kid she was a friend or girlfriend it would be fine.", "If you seriously don\u2019t understand the difference between sleeping with a stable committed partner/spouse that is part of the child\u2019s life and sneaking a fuck buddy in, you aren\u2019t mature enough to actually engage in this conversation.", "Huge difference between married parents having sex, or even sex with one consistent partner, than a rotation of random hookups.", "So what\u2019s your point? That she doesn\u2019t actually care and is bringing it up to OP to fuck with him? Or what?", "I would agree that he should have definitely talked to his daughter about it first and explained the situation.", "Wow ok. It didn't seem like he's bringing in a different woman every night nor introducing them to the kid, but go off I guess dude.", "oh here come the morality police \ud83c\udf7f"]}
