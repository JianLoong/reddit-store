{"id": 24495, "submission_id": "15pat1v", "title": "AITA for having an overnight guest while my daughter and her mom were staying at my house?", "selftext": "I (34M) have a 10 year old daughter with my ex girlfriend named Aubrey (34F). Me and Aubrey were never married and split 8 years ago whenever Claire was 1.5 years old. \n\nWe have split custody and trade each Sunday. Just to provide context me and Aubrey dated for 2 years before she got pregnant. We decided move in together but had very different lifestyle ideas. Since we started dating she talked about being a stay at home mom. I told her countless times I didn\u2019t want 1 income. Whenever our daughter was born we started fighting about her going back to nursing. She refused and said she didn\u2019t want to work. Eventually we split up after her saying that I \u201cwasn\u2019t mature enough\u201d to handle a family. But overall we do co parent well. Like we do family dinners on Sundays and go on trips together. Hell we even help each other with babysitting, sports teams travel and shopping. We do a great job together and I think our daughter appreciates us being on each others team so much. I\u2019d consider us good friends. She started dating someone a few months after we split and I met him whenever they moved in together. They dated for a few years and got engaged but have since separated and I was the one who helped her move out. Just trying to explain we are very good with each other typically. \n\nThe last 2 weeks aubrey has been staying in my guest room. Her house was getting some updates done and she asked to stay with me (she\u2019s no longer with her finance so she bought a new place). I let her and she told me to act like she wasn\u2019t there and just do my thing. It was also more time with my daughter so I saw no issue with it. My bedroom is attached to the back deck of my house. On Thursday I had a lady friend come over around 11 and stay the night and leave by 7. I\u2019ve done this countless times with my daughter home and she\u2019s never woken up. This lady friend specifically has been over multiple times the last few months. She\u2019s a nurse at the same hospital as Aubrey so she works odd hours so this is normal. \n\nI took Claire to a camp Friday morning and whenever I got home aubrey was fuming. She said she heard my guest come in last night and was disgusted. Saying that I needed to set a better example for my daughter and how dangerous it was to sneak random people in my house. I said she needed to check herself. As she is a guest and has no say of what I do in my home. She said other things that I can\u2019t remember as I was starting to tune her out but finally said something about it being bad for my daughter. I said \u201cyou know what\u2019s probably not good for Claire. You moving her in with random dudes and then breaking up. I\u2019m not moving her home anywhere like you have. I simply have guest over and she\u2019s never once noticed. So fuck right off with that.\u201d. \n\nAubrey then said something about how I needed to grow up. Aubrey and me have been staying away from each other. And I\u2019m thinking about asking her to get a hotel room as I\u2019m done with her shit about this. I\u2019m a grown ass man and can do what I want.

You don\u2019t know if she has noticed or not, you didn\u2019t know Aubrey noticed either! And really, you have someone staying over at your house for a few weeks and can\u2019t not have sex during that time? She at least had one, stable guy who she even got engaged to, you just sleep with people. YTA and Aubrey is 100% right. When you don\u2019t have Claire, fuck your brains out. But not when she\u2019s at home!", "Could go a few different ways on this one, but what moves the needle into the YTA zone for me is when you tried to turn it around and make it like she did something worse by ending a long-term relationship (sounds like the only one she\u2019s had since you broke up) when for all you know, that was the best thing to do in whatever the circumstances were.  And moving to a new house, as though that\u2019s something your daughter will never recover from, while you\u2019re somehow doing something noble by staying in the same place.  Reeeaaally?\n\nAnd also for telling her to fuck off because your daughter has never noticed you having a \u201cguest\u201d over. Aubrey is smart enough to know that just because a 10 year old girl hasn\u2019t confronted her father over sneaking women into the house during the night for sex that doesn\u2019t mean the 10 year old girl has never noticed this is happening even after \u201ccountless times\u201d. I mean- how is a young daughter supposed to initiate THAT conversation?", "NTA, but EHS you need to ask her to leave your home if she isn't willing to respect your privacy. Your house your rules, what you do with your personal time and inside your bedroom isn't her business or your childs business.\n\nESH, because you both are setting a bad example for healthy relationships for your child.", "She\u2019s probably jealous and still loves you", "YTA", "Yta for using \u201cwhenever\u201d instead of \u201cwhen\u201d throughout your post, but esh. Don\u2019t bring your fuck buddies over when you\u2019re daughters at your house. Ew.  But your ex is out of line for yelling at you while a guest in your home.", "ESH. Bad communication all around, and maybe don\u2019t have sex do loud that guests can hear it.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019ve just kinda did everything wrong by not communicating with her beforehand. \n\nYou\u2019re co parenting, whether or not your child realizes they\u2019re there, the co parent should probably know who\u2019s coming in and out while they (your kid) is staying with you. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t already tell you about people coming in and out of her household, I\u2019d consider changing my vote, but now you\u2019ve given her reason to not do that. \nAnd if you didn\u2019t care about who was around your child in her house because it was subsequently not your household, then that\u2019s neglecting your kid, my friend.
