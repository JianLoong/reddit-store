It wasn\u2019t the cleanest breakup but we left on good terms that was around 8 months ago.\n\nSo around a 2 months after we stopped dating she began dating one of my friends I\u2019ll call him bill; and since bill didn\u2019t much care for me I wasn\u2019t concerned about them dating and I was happy for them. Jump forward 5 months a lot of my family died and I was greatly saddened by their deaths which I questioned a lot of my life including Breaking up with bell. While she was my first love and of course I still care about her but because I was in a bad headspace it did not help me with not saying I messed up. One day around a week ago she picked up that something was wrong and asked me what was wrong and me being concerned that I if I told her I would try to convince myself that I still like her as a partner so I told her no, but she consisted for me to tell so I told her I will tell her when I\u2019m in a better headspace and she accepted that. Then as of yesterday I was doing better after talking to people I trusted and I told her on how I\u2019ve been in a bad headspace and been questioning my life and on how I did refer breaking up but I made my decision and how I am sorry that the breakup did hurt her feeling but then after ending our conversation I was blocked with no explanation in front of me. Ive just gotten contact and asked her why she blocked me her explanation is that she didn\u2019t know what to say and that it upset her that I say this after all this long.

You were a couple once, you're not a couple now, it doesn't look like you are close friends, and so it's natural that Bell might not want to hear some of your heavy stories. That doesn't make either of you bad people."]}
