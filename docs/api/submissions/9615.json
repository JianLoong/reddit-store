I had a similar situation on some back country roads, and it took spray paint and an imagination to get the attention of the county road commission.  Like you, they were out within a week and fixed the road.

No matter how cool it would be, you are, in fact, NOT Ron Swanson and you forced the city\u2019s hand. You could always tell you mom she can just wait next time something under the city\u2019s purview is damaged because regardless of what she thinks, you\u2019re not the city and it\u2019s not your job.

But you underestimate yourself- you are a handy man to have around!", "NTA can i hire your skills for the potholes by my house?", "NTA", "NTA! And guess what - everyone will get over it.

I always tell my co-workers, that I will get the job done, but don't ask how because then you become an accomplice!", "NTA - You're an inspiration to us all.", "I can think of other vulgar things to paint in the pothole, if the D was too much. How about a cat butt?\n\nEdit: NTA.", "the squeaky @#$% gets the fix\ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nBut I have to ask, does she often find what you do and say are not enough and/or belittle you even if you get the job done, or is this a one off?\n\nYou did great. You did the thing despite people making it very difficult to get that specific thing done. Your solution was creative. You should feel proud.", "LOL NTA.\n\nIt's gone, isn't it? You told her more than once that you aren't the pothole guy, and she kept harping on at you anyway. I hope you used the ugliest neon color possible for your masterpiece.", "NTA\n\nI am kinda worried that your sis doesn't have your back publicly.", "Soft YTA. You were trying to get the pothole fixed, so your heart was in the right place.    It's understandable that your mother is embarrassed that her house ended up on the news for this. You should have talked to her first and explained that it was this or keep the pothole, her choice.", "Modern problems, modern solutions. NTA", "NTA. Sounds like you can never win.

Pun fully intended.", "Yeah, the results speak for themselves.  There's many ways to approach a problem.  Credit to OP for finding a successful one.", "Honestly I\u2019m chuckling over it which is reason enough to say NTA. OP found a way to get it fixed by the people who should be responding for it in the first place. He also did it in a way that was good for a giggle before moving on.

That was my thought too! Reason he could not pay someone to do it is because it is illegal. It also takes much longer to fill a pothole properly than to spray a penis, also much more obvious, so much more likely to be caught", "Yeah, i mean what if the pot hole was a sign of a bigger problem like a sinkhole?", "I'd imagine on a public road there could also be liability issues if OP had attempted some bad fix job themselves.", "Even if I had a barrier I'm not doing the job. This is why we pay taxes. I already paid money towards the budget of the road being fixed, I'm not using my private funds and time to fix something the city is too inefficient to fix themselves.", "> The way you did it was indeed immature\n\nBy what metric, exactly? It was a reasoned decision to draw something the city would find objectionable enough to act on - and repair the pothole. And it worked exactly as intended.\n\nWhat's immature about it? It was astute - a fully conceived idea, and based on a knowledge of city government politics. It was arguably vulgar - but there's no basis for calling the plan immature.\n\nDrawing dicks for it's own sake is immature, but context is everything.", "Over a year.", "What's the worst they could have done to me?
