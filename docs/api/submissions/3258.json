Being autistic isnt an excuse to be RUDE and yes the way you handled that WAS rude, and your back and forth in the comments is another example of that. \n\n\"I'm sorry, i really am not interested in discussing Emergency Alerts, maybe we can find a topic we both enjoy?\" \n\nThats blunt, but still polite.", "YTA.

You say he rarely talks about it, once every few months. This isn\u2019t something he is constantly spewing at you. It\u2019s what, maybe 6 times a year? The way you responded was really rude and insensitive. It wasn\u2019t being blunt, it was being mean to someone. You are acting like a bully- he was trying to express a difficulty he faces to you and you shut him down and blocked him. No where in this post does it indicate that he is constantly bothering you. If he was texting you about his interests all the time then I would understand. But he doesn\u2019t. He wanted to share something with you that he loves because he thought you were the only person he might be able to connect with. Have you thought about how sad that is?

I have both friends and family that do this and there is only so many '3 hour explanations of stuff you don't care about without them ever trying to find out what you care about or talking about something that is more interesting to you' a person can take before snapping.\n\nKnowing this, however, I believe it should be your responsibility to be blunt in a less denigrating way. Telling people that you don't want to talk about certain topics is fine and you don't have to explain yourself beyond 'this does not interest me as it does you'. That being said, you don't need to be hurtful. That is why yta. This is simply about how you phrased things.", "YTA. Why did you have to block him?

Walking away from people because they're discussing a normal topic like politics is rude, you can simply listen along in silence or excuse yourself politely, otherwise people will think you don't care about them period. \"Being blunt\" is everyone's favourite euphemism for being rude and pretending it's honesty. News flash: your honest opinions can be and in this case are pretty dang rude and are not things to be said to anyone. Those are what we call \"inside thoughts.\" Completely unnecessary to say that to your coworker, and you need to check yourself before people stop trying to cater to you and your attitude and you end up with no one to talk to.

A good way to handle this would have been to say, \u201cHey, I\u2019m so sorry, but for my mental health, I can\u2019t talk about politics.

I observed that you are very interested in these topics though, and I think it is great that you have your own personal interests and think so highly on them.

Also understand that he most likely meant 0 harm to you and probably just didn\u2019t pick up that you were uninterested, leading to him continuing to talk about the topic thinking you didn\u2019t mind it. I know from personal experience that sometimes when you (not literally \u2018you\u2019) start talking to people and don\u2019t automatically get rejected, you form an attachment to them, sometimes leading to you over-sharing interests. I felt genuine pain and sadness when you mentioned that he asked if you liked him, because I often have experiences where I get really scared that someone hates me/thinks i\u2019m annoying. So I often ask questions like that for reassurance. \n\nto conclude, apologize, and try to look at others perspectives more (not blaming you for this cause I struggle with it too lol), and if a persistent topic makes you uncomfortable or doesn\u2019t interest you, tell people that in a way that you hope others would talk to you.
