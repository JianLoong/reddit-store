I skipped mine all together.", "NAH but it sounds like the tickets are accounted for. I would spend your energy asking around with other families. Not every family will need all 6, it's totally possible they might have a late drop out (edit: a guest who drops out late). So maybe you'll find a spare. Kinda bold of your fiance to demand that she should take one of the tickets from the boy's grandparents.", "She thinks she deserves to be at his graduation more than his grandparents?

Additionally, from what I see here your son's grand parents (your in laws) are a part of his life since he was born so of course they come second right after you and your ex wife. Grandparents > your fiancee here.", "NTA... but you his mom and grandparents should for sure get tickets", "NAH.  Crappy situation but hard to foresee - just have to try to figure out a compromise, not sure what it is.", "Info who does your *son* want at his graduation?  His aunt or his step mom?\n\nEdit bc I totally misread it. Does your son want his step mom or his siblings at graduation. \n\nAlso how old are then siblings?  Do they even want to go?", "NTA-can\u2019t believe she even asked for a ticket, and can\u2019t believe you had the guts to ask your ex to bring a \u201cguest\u201d. This is a graduation. It\u2019s not about you or your fianc\u00e9e. The only person who should be deciding this is your SON!", "NTA. Go and celebrate your son, and enjoy his night with him. It\u2019s on your fianc\u00e9 son as to why now she\u2019s no longer able to come unless she probably goes to their school office and get the extra ticket because that\u2019s what I had to do when my niece  graduated in 2022. She can talk to the school about that. But it\u2019s not your son\u2019s fault that her son chose to drop out that\u2019s on her son and her son only", "NTA -  - you really cannot take back tickets already given away", "NTA your fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t demand a ticket.

Your ex-wife's sister was kind enough to give you her ticket, so count your blessings", "NTA. The only asshole thing here is your ex wife for commenting on fiancee's son dropping out.\n\nYour other two kids, you, and your ex wife should go. That only leaves 2 tickets left. Frankly it makes sense for it to go to your son'a grandparents over your fiancee - given he's 18 and you aren't married yet, I assume he's probably closer to them than to her by a smidge.  Has nothing to do with your fiancee's son dropping out though. \n\nIdeally of course everyone would go - its just an unfortunate situation. Maybe go out for dinner with everyone afterwards, so your fiancee et al can celebrate.", "ESH. You and your ex shouldn't be making this decision. Your son is the one graduating, and he should be the one deciding who he wants to have there.", "YTA and your wife is one too. Your ex is absolutely correct.", "Yta Have your son ask his friends if they will have an extra ticket. This happens every year at every graduation. It may be last minute but if your son works at it he could find one.", "NTA\n\nBordering on N A H. But the tickets are a finite resource, and unfortunately some people will get left out.  Can you contact the school and ask for additional tickets?  Given the circumstances you might be able to get at least one.", "NAH so far.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a decision for you and your ex to make. This is a decision for your son to make. Without any pressure or guilt trips being applied. Let him choose who he wants in attendance, and accept it if he chooses his grandparents over your fianc\u00e9e.", "NAH: your son should decide who he would like there, if he is comfortable with that.", "Yta", "NTA - You guys should split the tickets, 2 for you, 2 for her and 1 each for your other children. If your fianc\u00e9e son didn't go to that school, you would've gotten 2 tickets. Your fianc\u00e9e son no longer goes to that school, so you should split them. Unless you forced your fianc\u00e9e son to drop out, it's not your fault either.", "NTA.\n\nHave you tried reaching out to the school to see if an exception would be made?", "YTA because you wasn\u2019t planning on going to your sons graduation in the first place, that\u2019s why you gave your ex all of the tickets. You should be thankful that her sister is willing to give up her ticket, so you can pretend that you was always going to attend.\n\nAs for your fianc\u00e9e, she doesn\u2019t get a replacement graduation with your son, especially because she along with you had decided that her son\u2019s graduation was more important than yours\n\nEdit: I misread the post as the sons graduations being at different schools and the OP using his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s tickets to see her son graduate instead of his own. That\u2019s on me", "Does your son know someone with an extra ticket? We only got 4 and I only need 3 but my friend needed 5 so I gave her one of mine.", "NAH. This situation really sucks, but it is what it is. Maybe ask around and see if there are any other families with extra tickets. Also, as others have pointed out, ask your son who he wants to go. That should take precedence over everything", "You might want to check with the office at his school about getting an extra ticket. I worked in a high school office for several years; we distributed six tickets per graduate, but always had some extra tickets allocated for tricky situations like this. Also, some families would not need their allotted six and would turn them back in or offer them up for those needing more.", "Have your son ask one of his friends for extra tickets. Not every graduate is going to use all 6.", "NTA its not your fault her son dropped out. You were kind enough to let her have all 6 tickets but shit happens so now you should each get 3 of your sons tickets", "NTA.
