Did your parents make sure she understood this was a limited time instance of getting money or offer advice themselves over the last six years? Was she asking you for money? As it stands without those details it sounds like you\u2019re sympathetic enough with someone who basically is at the same place most everyone else would have been six years earlier, having a high school education, and a whole world of opportunities, and unlike a lot of other people, still a good chunk of money to help get her started.", "NAH, but she has some tough adult decisions to make on her own (assuming that she\u2019s not asking to dip into your trust funds).

I'm aware of how incredibly lucky I was to have the opportunity, so I made it last. It sounds like she made some really bad money decisions while traveling too - she has no idea the value of a dollar, because there were always more dollars coming in, until there weren't. \n\nI wish her luck, but the road ahead is going to be really, really hard for her, especially if she's never held a regular job or paid American prices for living expenses.

That way she gets accommodation, without having to live off your parents etc,  some money, and something to put down on the resum\u00e8.  I know I'm preaching to the choir but she needs a short to medium term plan, and she needs to earn that money, so that she learns to save it properly. The inheritance in a way did her a disservice when it came to money management - there are people who are just not adept. \n\nAlso whilst she is looking she can do some busking, even if she's just making cents a day, she is doing something with her time.

The degree is so they can tell their clients that they have college grads teaching English, but being a native speaker and passing your TOEFL is the most important part.", "Ok based on that I would say nah. You can have your opinion, and she drew it out of you. And she can worry without hurting anyone. I would say, though, that while I agree with your course, and would have done the same, I dont think choosing to travel and busk is not an inherently worse decision, and she'll probably figure it out a way to live and will not regret it after a few years.

The first generation makes it, the second grows it, and the third blows it.  I didn't want to be a part of that sad story.", "Ahh makes sense, so was, erm, indulged. That of course hasn't done her any favours. On the plus side she is young enough to turn things around for herself financially, she just needs to be willing to have a plan (what she is going to do, how she is going to do it, by when, costs she needs to account for) and follow it through, make sacrifices. If you have this conversation with her again, maybe consider telling her you will help her, not by putting your hands in your pocket, but giving her financial and job seeker's guidance, if she wants it. That way, the ball is in her court. In addition, I hope she is not harassing your parents for money, if she is they need to say a strong 'no', or lend with conditions, i.e if she doesn't pay back by x date or before they pass, then it should be considered her only inheritance. It's sounds harsh and maybe it is unrealistic for them to take that approach, but if she doesn't get a grip now, she never will. \n\nIf she is onboard with taking financial responsibility, she should look at downloading a budgeting app, to help her live within her means and save for what she wants to do.", "Forgot to add, I did a language degree years ago, and in my country, the UK, people, even those without language degrees, can get a TEFL (traching English as a foreign languange) qualification online - don't know if you have this in the States.

People who are in their mid-20s abroad often wind up being pretty successful, and losing the crutch of the inherited money will probably give her motivation.\n\nBesides, being 27 is far from too late to start college or a career. It'll be tough for a while but it  can be done. So while it may turn out she regrets her decisions \u2013 she definitely should've gone to college first \u2013 I've never really met anyone who regrets travelling in her 20s.

You also own your own visa, and you can work multiple teaching jobs, while still only working 40hrs a week, to make a lot.   \n\n\nJapan pays very little, there was a study from a Japanese university before covid showing, foreigners would make more money, and have better benefits, working full time in a convenience store than teaching English there. I think McDonalds back home pays more and has better benefits. Foreigners have to adapt to the culture here, and are basically expected to know and adhere to everything too. Living there is a lot of fun, I personally lived there for a bit, but the work culture is brutal. It's also expensive to live in, I have a friend that will skip 1 - 2 meals a day, to have fun money on the weekends.  \n\n\nsouth Korea is a bit of a jack of all trades, master of none. Working at a public school will eventually pay well, but gives a good amount of time off, you will get rent paid for (in your contract) up to a certain amount, the amount of teaching is reasonable, and they will generally tell you important cultural stuff they want you to follow, but understand you won't know their culture well and stuff. Pay starts low, but gets to an okay amount, cost of living is low-ish, but rising, and they haven't increased wages in over 20 years for foreign teachers.  \n\n\nI don't know about other Asian countries.  \nBut, while it's true you need a 3 year degree + TESOL certs in order to teach in public schools in Asia, you can often find private academies that will be willing to hire people that only have TESOL certs (online ones don't take long to do at all, I got my 240 hour one done really quickly). Generally the private academies are not good to work for though.  \nOther options, she could teach English online to students from Asia and make a good amount. Qualified teachers can make around $50 per lesson (which basically lasts 40 - 60mins), is usually one on one, but requires you teach at the time the student is available.   \n\n\nTL;DR: while the pay isn't great teaching in Asia, usually the cost of living is usually much lower which allows you to save a lot of your money every month.
