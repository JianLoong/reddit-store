But she has made some very poor, in my opinion, decisions.  \n\nI (F33) am six years older than my sister. She is a brilliant and talented musician.  I cannot praise her skill enough. Truthfully I am somewhat jealous of it. I didn't get that. \n\nThere are four kids in my family. My two older brothers, myself and my sister.  My brother's are much older than us.  They love us but they are more like young uncles to us. The younger one was in university when my sister was born.  \n\nMy parents had money set aside for us that our grandparents had saved for us. Our parents invested the money and contributed to it.  They weren't horrible people so they didn't take it for themselves or hold it over us to control us. \n\nWhen we graduated from high school we were told that there was money for us. We could use it for school or to invest or whatever. It was ours. The only stipulation was that we would get it in yearly installments for six years.  \n\nI guess that way we would not blow it all on coke and hookers and had a chance to grow up before it was lol gone.  \n\nI got some financial assistance for my education so I actually managed to save almost half of mine.  Enough for a sizable downpayment on a house when I was 24.  \n\nThat was the year my sister graduated.  She decided to go see the world. She traveled through Europe and Australia.  She went snowboarding in New Zealand and Argentina.  \n\nI told her that she should save some for school. She said that she was making money busking and that she was okay.  \n\nThen COVID happened.  I thought maybe she would come home and study while the world was shut down.  Nope. She stayed in Indonesia because it was cheap to live there.  \n\nWell now she is home. She is down to her last installment. My parents signed over the account to her with all the money that was left.  \n\nIt's enough to get her back to Indonesia. But now she is looking at the account and realizing that she is at the end.  There is no more coming.  \n\nShe asked me out for coffee and was crying because she might have to use the money to pay for an apartment and then figure out what to do.  She wants to go to teach English as a second language in Asia. And while you can do that with certification you won't get paid very much.  You need  a proper degree for some of the well paying positions.  \n\nI did not say \"I told you so\" but she could guess what I was thinking.  She says I'm an asshole for judging her choices and not supporting her lifestyle.  \n\nI wish I had travelled more when I was younger. But I got an education instead. So did our brothers.  She chose to use her money that way.

You could suggest\n1) taking a temporary job in an office, albeit part time\n2) do something with her music. If she can play the piano or organ, she can play for churches, when they need one.

It doesn\u2019t sound as though she asking to be rescued from the consequences of her decisions so much as looking for some sympathy for the situation she\u2019s in, which is not exactly unusual.  \n\nMany people prize experiences over material possessions - the trick is having a funding source for those experiences, which often requires an education, some meaningful professional experience and/or a wealthy background. Knowing how to organize that at the beginning is a rarity.", "I think it was fine that she wanted to travel but she knew it would come to an end in 6 years. Sounds like she put off thinking about her future and had no backup plan. NTA for telling her to get a job as mentioned in the comments (hopefully NOW since she just got the last of it) but YWBTA if you were snarky about the \"I told you to get an education\".

But I would say if you volunteered criticism then it was not a useful point to make in the moment and would make you slightly the asshole. But if she was asking you for financial support that might make her slight ta, though I suppose you could always have said no without adding the criticism of how she spent her money.", "I have two rules when it comes to being receptive to other people laying their troubles on me. First, I always use the THINK method before weighing in\n\nIs it True  \nIs it Helpful  \nIs it Inspiring  \nIs it Necessary  \nIs it Kind\n\nIf it doesn't answer yes to all of these, I probably should keep my mouth shut\n\nSecond, I always evaluate what is the best kind of support, and often ask the person who is venting to me what kind of support they need. Do they just want an active listener, or reassurance, or do they want to get advice and strategy. This is really important to determine how to be there for someone. \n\nI can see it's an unpopular opinion, but I'm going with YTA. You did say \"I told you so\" by implying that your sister should have gotten a job instead of traveling, and instead of being sympathetic and supportive, you criticized.

Was she able to tell what you were thinking because in the earlier instances, like telling her she should save for school, did you act judgy, or did you unnecessarily confirm you were judging her now, as opposed to how you put it here indicating it was just a different life choice? Did your parents make sure she understood this was a limited time instance of getting money or offer advice themselves over the last six years? Was she asking you for money? As it stands without those details it sounds like you\u2019re sympathetic enough with someone who basically is at the same place most everyone else would have been six years earlier, having a high school education, and a whole world of opportunities, and unlike a lot of other people, still a good chunk of money to help get her started.", "NAH, but she has some tough adult decisions to make on her own (assuming that she\u2019s not asking to dip into your trust funds). Agree that she should have used some of this for education before travel, but perhaps she has matured as a person to some degree through this life experience. She could return back to your country, get a part time job to pay for the certification process and return back to Indonesia.  She is irresponsible though for not keeping an eye on the funds remaining and assuming it would carry her further despite spending all of it to date.", "Personally I don\u2019t see the problem with \u2018I told you so\u2019. \n\nTo me that\u2019s acknowledging that I pointed out this exact possibility happening and you ended up in said possibility after ignoring what I\u2019ve said. \n\nSo when I say \u201cI told you so\u201d it really means: I\u2019ve already given you advice that you disregarded, so I\u2019m not going to devote more effort the problem.

She is in a situation of her own making and she shouldn't expect you to \"support her lifestyle.\"  That's what she's used the money for and now she'll have to figure out a way to make money to continue to live independently.", "NTA. Sounds like her trust funded some wonderful adventures and some very expensive hobbies- skiing in NZ for the day probably cost a month of living expenses in SE Asia for a month. \n\nI'm afraid she's learning that being naturally talented is worth next to nothing if you don't add some hard work to that formula. She had a ton of opportunities and it sounds like she let a lot of them pass her by while she was off having fun. \n\nI had an opportunity to use some money from a small trust to fund my travels in my mid-20's. But that was after I went to college (thankfully paid for by my parents) and started working, so I knew the value of a dollar. I made $45,000 last a full year of traveling. I'm aware of how incredibly lucky I was to have the opportunity, so I made it last. It sounds like she made some really bad money decisions while traveling too - she has no idea the value of a dollar, because there were always more dollars coming in, until there weren't. \n\nI wish her luck, but the road ahead is going to be really, really hard for her, especially if she's never held a regular job or paid American prices for living expenses. It sucks, I hope she has some lovely memories to sustain her.", "NTA, and right now your sister is facing one of the least enjoyable aspects of being an adult, the consequences of ones own choices and actions.", "NTA at all.  You suggested to her that she needed to use the money more wisely early on, she didn't, and now she's out of it.  That's on her.", "Lol she cried because she has to use the end of her trust fund to get a nice, stable apartment and start working for a living?

Unfortunately, I recently had to have a similar chat with my younger brother, so I know what you're going through.", "YTA for judging her choices. I actually don\u2019t think her choices were bad at all. They were just different from yours and your brothers\u2019. I feel like there might be some jealousy here. Hell, I\u2019m kind of jealous. I so badly want to be able to travel. And I have my degree, but it hasn\u2019t helped much in my paycheck-to-paycheck life. Moving forward, her options are limited, but she doesn\u2019t have to give up her dream. It just might take a little longer and more work than she initially thought. You are in the middle of a great opportunity to help your sister figure out her options, both short term and long term. Instead, you\u2019re choosing to sit back on your high horse and say, \u201cI told you so.\u201d Judging her is not going to pull her out of her self pity, but a little guidance and support probably would.\n\nWhen you said poor choices, I was waiting for drugs and alcohol, partying and blowing her money on stupid things.

Other than babysitting band busking I don't think she has ever had a job.", "From OP responding to the judgement bot:\n\n> I might be the asshole because I reminded her that she could have chosen to get an education and travel less.\n\nOP, you did in fact say \"I told you so\", but in different words.  YTA.", "Except she is 26 and only has two jobs on her resume.  Babysitter and busker.", "Other than babysitting and busking she has never had a job.  She is 26 years old.

No work-y no eat-y", "I now understand, not much work experience. If she undertook any employment whilst abroad, surely she can add it to her resum\u00e8 that will enable her to start saving?  Her work history is not great, but could she not start from there, i.e., consider being an au-pair for a while. That way she gets accommodation, without having to live off your parents etc,  some money, and something to put down on the resum\u00e8.  I know I'm preaching to the choir but she needs a short to medium term plan, and she needs to earn that money, so that she learns to save it properly. The inheritance in a way did her a disservice when it came to money management - there are people who are just not adept. \n\nAlso whilst she is looking she can do some busking, even if she's just making cents a day, she is doing something with her time.  She has choices, she just needs to sit back, review and have a plan. It seems to me her issue is lack of planning.", "Sound advice. I wish she would have taken it", "That's true. The biggest things most international schools in Asia care about are your accent (because they want it to be a good one, like posh British or Mid-Atlantic American English) and that you \"look right\" (basically young and white, maybe some other ethnicities but the shitty reality is that a lot of schools in Asian countries are fine discriminating by race or skin color). The degree is so they can tell their clients that they have college grads teaching English, but being a native speaker and passing your TOEFL is the most important part.", "Ok based on that I would say nah. You can have your opinion, and she drew it out of you. And she can worry without hurting anyone. I would say, though, that while I agree with your course, and would have done the same, I dont think choosing to travel and busk is not an inherently worse decision, and she'll probably figure it out a way to live and will not regret it after a few years. So I would encourage you to continue not taking an \"I told you so\" position and that you and she can have mutual respect, or at least indifference, to the different ways you treated your windfall.", "You're 6 years older than her and no one could have predicted Covid. Knowing the world would practically  shut down for 2 years in 2020 would have lead to people making lots of different choices, especially younger people.", "At 26, you can get a job and experience. At 26, once you are settled in a career, it's way harder to then get to travel and explore the world.\n\n\nAnd, honestly, you're all pretty spoiled.

They were tired. They did their best but she got away with a lot.", "Me too.", "I take about six weeks of holidays a year.  It's super easy because my education didn't put me into debt and helped me get a great job with lots of free time. And my house is waiting for me when I get home because I chose to buy one instead of blowing my money on trips.  I know we are privileged.  But I always remember the saying about fortunes. The first generation makes it, the second grows it, and the third blows it.  I didn't want to be a part of that sad story.", "Ahh makes sense, so was, erm, indulged. That of course hasn't done her any favours. On the plus side she is young enough to turn things around for herself financially, she just needs to be willing to have a plan (what she is going to do, how she is going to do it, by when, costs she needs to account for) and follow it through, make sacrifices. If you have this conversation with her again, maybe consider telling her you will help her, not by putting your hands in your pocket, but giving her financial and job seeker's guidance, if she wants it. That way, the ball is in her court. In addition, I hope she is not harassing your parents for money, if she is they need to say a strong 'no', or lend with conditions, i.e if she doesn't pay back by x date or before they pass, then it should be considered her only inheritance. It's sounds harsh and maybe it is unrealistic for them to take that approach, but if she doesn't get a grip now, she never will. \n\nIf she is onboard with taking financial responsibility, she should look at downloading a budgeting app, to help her live within her means and save for what she wants to do.", "Forgot to add, I did a language degree years ago, and in my country, the UK, people, even those without language degrees, can get a TEFL (traching English as a foreign languange) qualification online - don't know if you have this in the States. The course is not a long one. Once she qualifies, she can teach online classes. A friend of mine, with whom I studied German does this, teaching people in China, and she lives on a farm in South Wales! This would be a great entree for your sister moving back to Asia eventually . But again, that is down to how committed she is. \n\nTo reiterate, YNTA, she, as you Americans aptly and succinctly say, needs to own her choices and behaviour.", "Again, incredibly privileged and LUCKY. Most people, even with degrees, don't get even close to that much vacation time.", "Unless you are in Europe."]}
