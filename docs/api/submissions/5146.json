Did your parents make sure she understood this was a limited time instance of getting money or offer advice themselves over the last six years? Was she asking you for money? As it stands without those details it sounds like you\u2019re sympathetic enough with someone who basically is at the same place most everyone else would have been six years earlier, having a high school education, and a whole world of opportunities, and unlike a lot of other people, still a good chunk of money to help get her started.", "NAH, but she has some tough adult decisions to make on her own (assuming that she\u2019s not asking to dip into your trust funds).

That way she gets accommodation, without having to live off your parents etc,  some money, and something to put down on the resum\u00e8.  I know I'm preaching to the choir but she needs a short to medium term plan, and she needs to earn that money, so that she learns to save it properly.

The degree is so they can tell their clients that they have college grads teaching English, but being a native speaker and passing your TOEFL is the most important part.", "Ok based on that I would say nah. You can have your opinion, and she drew it out of you. And she can worry without hurting anyone. I would say, though, that while I agree with your course, and would have done the same, I dont think choosing to travel and busk is not an inherently worse decision, and she'll probably figure it out a way to live and will not regret it after a few years.

The first generation makes it, the second grows it, and the third blows it.  I didn't want to be a part of that sad story.", "Ahh makes sense, so was, erm, indulged. That of course hasn't done her any favours. On the plus side she is young enough to turn things around for herself financially, she just needs to be willing to have a plan (what she is going to do, how she is going to do it, by when, costs she needs to account for) and follow it through, make sacrifices. If you have this conversation with her again, maybe consider telling her you will help her, not by putting your hands in your pocket, but giving her financial and job seeker's guidance, if she wants it. That way, the ball is in her court. In addition, I hope she is not harassing your parents for money, if she is they need to say a strong 'no', or lend with conditions, i.e if she doesn't pay back by x date or before they pass, then it should be considered her only inheritance. It's sounds harsh and maybe it is unrealistic for them to take that approach, but if she doesn't get a grip now, she never will. \n\nIf she is onboard with taking financial responsibility, she should look at downloading a budgeting app, to help her live within her means and save for what she wants to do.", "Forgot to add, I did a language degree years ago, and in my country, the UK, people, even those without language degrees, can get a TEFL (traching English as a foreign languange) qualification online - don't know if you have this in the States.

So while it may turn out she regrets her decisions \u2013 she definitely should've gone to college first \u2013 I've never really met anyone who regrets travelling in her 20s.

It's due to her full-grown-adult personality.\n\nNo one is getting a pass for being young post-25, and *that* is already stretching the term to it's absolute limit.", "No matter your tone she was hoping that you would say like you can come stay in my house for free.", "> It kills me that there is so much \"she made a mistake in traveling\". The travel was not the mistake.\n\nYou are having this problem because you're intentionally misrepresenting the point of most of those posts. You even go on to admit in your own words that the lack of planning for next steps were her mistakes -- mistakes she made *in her travels*.\n\nYes - she made a mistake in travelling. Specifically, her lack of forethought about what to do when her dwindling resources were fully depleted.\n\nVanishingly few people are saying \"the travel was a mistake - in and of itself.\" Almost everyone is saying \"the travel was a mistake - because she had absolutely no long term plan for when the money that was running out ran out.\"\n\nWhat's killing you is something you're projecting onto most posts. It's not something you're finding there.", "sugar daddy is generally not married to you", "I think this is a kinder reading of the post. Sure, the sister made grasshopper choices rather than ant choices, but it sounds as though she had a lot of fun. \n\nWhat's wrong with just saying to the sister that she had an amazing time with the money, and that's not nothing, and in fact she's still got a bit of money to plan with, and if she wants to plan things differently, sibling is happy to lend an ear...?", "The difference is you don\u2019t need a lawyer or a casket to jump from one sugar daddy no the next \ud83d\ude02", "yep, coddling too much will only hurt the other person, which sounds like is what the parents did to little sis.", "It's possible to be kind and compassionate and not enable bad decisions and behavior. It's possible to tell someone a hard truth they need to face without being a dick.", "Being kind and being enabling are two entirely different things.", "As an English language teacher for over 20 years I can guarantee you she will not get a job that pays anything without a degree. She won\u2019t be able to legally work in other countries because they require a degree for visas. Even online she\u2019ll need some evidence of a degree (unless the site is dodgy). COVID also decimated the TEFL world and I know teachers with Masters and 20+years of teaching and management in TEFL who lost their jobs and are just getting back into new jobs. Most reputable TEFL courses will also not accept people without a degree (unless there are unique circumstances). This position is unrealistic and OPs sister knows it.", "Connections that she may have made had she used the money to get into a good music program. Of curse, not Miley Cyrus level connections, but perhaps livable wage level connections.\n\nShe could even have taken a gap year to travel and pursue other interests while she figured out what she wanted to do, but she just decided not to plan at all.", "Actually I know what a/bandofburritos means and they\u2019re not saying be heartless. They\u2019re just saying when everyone just constantly placates and coddles and let\u2019s people act like circumstances that were entirely their own making are just some crazy, unfair, totally unforeseen twist of fate that they couldn\u2019t possibly prepare  for it does more harm than good.\n\nSorry but a big part of being an adult is taking responsibility for your actions. Sister was careless and short sighted with her money. Op DID do the kind, responsible thing by warning her and trying to get her to do something while she had other options.\n\nNow sis is stuck with the choices she made and unless I\u2019m reading this wrong she was angling for op to fork over some of her money she saved to fix the problem sis created for herself.\n\nThis is all the more reason to actually NOT seem overly empathetic and kind as this tells the person angling for a handout that they came to the right place.\n\nAnd yes I know that sounds cruel and heartless and going by your comment you\u2019ll think I\u2019m emotionally closed off or broken or whatever but I\u2019m not- I just have multiple leech like family members that will latch on and take you for whatever they can get if the get half a chance and then move onto the next one.\n\nEmpathy is important and no being kind doesn\u2019t always cost you but people being nothing but kind and helpful and coddling can end up making someone unable or unwilling to deal with the reality of their lives because they feel they\u2019ll always have someone to bail them out.", "\u2026yes, I know?"]}
