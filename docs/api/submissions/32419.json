Especially for babies and children, second hand smoke, INCLUDING smoke on clothes, is bad for babies health. Its not just a harmless smell, it is residual chemicals that create that smell. Second hand smoke is also unfiltered unlike the actual inhaled smoke which makes it even more dangerous. Best practice is to as you said, change clothes and shower. Actually, best practice is to quit smoking since residuals are never 100% gone.  But here you are. Get your doctor to tell him.", "NTA and I cannot say that strongly enough. If he handles your baby while there are still chemicals on his clothes, hair and body, he\u2019s absolutely going to make your baby sick. It can cause asthma and other respiratory issues. And if your child already has any breathing issues it will make it worse.\n\nThird-hand smoke is a legitimate issue that most smokers like to live in denial about. \n\nI didn\u2019t even think it was a big deal until I had to spend a lot of time in my father\u2019s car while commuting to my grandparent\u2019s home while my grandmother was dying of lung cancer (unrelated but ironic) because I was having major issues with my asthma but didn\u2019t realize why until she died and I was no longer driving with my parents and hour each way. My cough finally subsided but then acted up again the moment we started packing up my grandfather to move into independent living. \n\nIt took months of doctors visits and chest X-rays to realize it was because my father smokes cigars and would drive back from his cigar buddies in his car with all of those chemicals all over him. He didn\u2019t even have to smoke in the car for me to get really sick. \n\nOf course my father denied it and often got mad at me for asking him to change after smoking. It wasn\u2019t until I YELLED at him that he was putting his hobby before my health that it finally sunk in for him. \n\nDon\u2019t back down on this. If he doesn\u2019t believe you, talk to your pediatrician about sources to share with him.

Kindly sit down and show him the guidance and reasons why it could be harmful, and make a plan together so that he can still get to spend quality time with his baby (which I'm sure you will appreciate too) whether it's cutting down, nicotine gum or planning his cigarette breaks more carefully. Hopefully you can help him to understand the reasons through showing him the evidence and discuss a solution together. Good luck", "There are health risks to residual smoke - also called third hand smoke. So ignore everyone saying it\u2019s fine.

We were taken from our local hospital ER to the larger hospital the next town over in an ambulance, running code, because her blood oxygen was so low and the breathing treatments they gave her at the local hospital were not helping. When we arrived, the pediatric pulmonologist and team were waiting at the ambulance entrance. While they were stabilizing her, a nurse asked my (now ex) husband and I questions. They asked if either of us smoked. He said no (which was a lie) and I honestly said no. When she left the room, I asked him why he lied when our daughter was in crisis. He did not have time to answer because the nurse walked in. My daughter's test results indicated nicotine in her system. He said he did not think it was untruthful because he never smoked around her, he always went outside. The nurse had a few choice words for him and walked out. The respiratory therapist later educated him about the chemicals that absorb into your clothes and skin when you are a smoker. My daughter spent 10 days in the PICU, 4 of them on a ventilator. She made a full recovery. Please get your husband to go with you to your next pediatrician appointment and ask that all of the dangers of second hand chemicals that absorb into the clothing and skin as a result of smoking be explained to him.", "NTA.

Have him Google and learn what he's doing to himself and everyone around him.\n\nGo ahead and downvite me, smokers. It doesn't make it less true that you're screwing the rest of us over against our will.", "The doctor's post is all you need.

Have him use a \u2018smoking jacket\u2019 (a jacket or sweater he wears while he smokes), that he takes off immediately when he comes inside. Also for him to wash his hands with soap and water and some gum is also a good idea if you\u2019re concerned about it on his breath. That\u2019s plenty of precaution. My best friend is a smoker and this worked well for us when she was over helping with the baby.

Your husband is a dumb", "NTA - you're right,  the toxins stay on the clothing and skin and your baby is small and fragile. \n\nMaybe you could get him to go elegant old school with a smokin' smoking jacket (read: dressing gown) that he can wear when he's smoking, take it off, leave it outside, wash his hands then handle the baby.

But I can understand his hurt from being made to take a full shower, especially if she's not usually awake when he gets home.\n\nYes, third hand smoke is a thing, but the primary danger of it is the build up over time and the oxidation. Even the dozens of articles various people have already posted don't recommend a full shower. Whatever smoke got through his clothes to land on his skin from that one cigarette (besides things in direct contact like hands) is not an appreciable danger. Wash hands, definitely. Even face. Have him change shirts. But having him fully shower every night before he can hold his child is a little extra.", "NTA. I\u2019m a father of three and I\u2019m also a smoker, there is no excuse to expose your kids to toxic smells and residue such as cigarette smoke. I would have kicked my own ass if I expected to hold my 3 month old after having smoked. If you choose to smoke, then you have to choose to deal with some consequences.

We have to watch out for our kids, they are helpless", "NTA.. but I've heard this before from a friend.  I know you mean well but here's the other side of that.
