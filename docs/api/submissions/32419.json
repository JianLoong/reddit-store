Especially for babies and children, second hand smoke, INCLUDING smoke on clothes, is bad for babies health. Its not just a harmless smell, it is residual chemicals that create that smell. Second hand smoke is also unfiltered unlike the actual inhaled smoke which makes it even more dangerous. Best practice is to as you said, change clothes and shower. Actually, best practice is to quit smoking since residuals are never 100% gone.  But here you are. Get your doctor to tell him.", "NTA and I cannot say that strongly enough. If he handles your baby while there are still chemicals on his clothes, hair and body, he\u2019s absolutely going to make your baby sick. It can cause asthma and other respiratory issues. And if your child already has any breathing issues it will make it worse.\n\nThird-hand smoke is a legitimate issue that most smokers like to live in denial about. \n\nI didn\u2019t even think it was a big deal until I had to spend a lot of time in my father\u2019s car while commuting to my grandparent\u2019s home while my grandmother was dying of lung cancer (unrelated but ironic) because I was having major issues with my asthma but didn\u2019t realize why until she died and I was no longer driving with my parents and hour each way. My cough finally subsided but then acted up again the moment we started packing up my grandfather to move into independent living. \n\nIt took months of doctors visits and chest X-rays to realize it was because my father smokes cigars and would drive back from his cigar buddies in his car with all of those chemicals all over him. He didn\u2019t even have to smoke in the car for me to get really sick. \n\nOf course my father denied it and often got mad at me for asking him to change after smoking. It wasn\u2019t until I YELLED at him that he was putting his hobby before my health that it finally sunk in for him. \n\nDon\u2019t back down on this. If he doesn\u2019t believe you, talk to your pediatrician about sources to share with him.

Kindly sit down and show him the guidance and reasons why it could be harmful, and make a plan together so that he can still get to spend quality time with his baby (which I'm sure you will appreciate too) whether it's cutting down, nicotine gum or planning his cigarette breaks more carefully. Hopefully you can help him to understand the reasons through showing him the evidence and discuss a solution together. Good luck", "There are health risks to residual smoke - also called third hand smoke. So ignore everyone saying it\u2019s fine.

We were taken from our local hospital ER to the larger hospital the next town over in an ambulance, running code, because her blood oxygen was so low and the breathing treatments they gave her at the local hospital were not helping. When we arrived, the pediatric pulmonologist and team were waiting at the ambulance entrance. While they were stabilizing her, a nurse asked my (now ex) husband and I questions. They asked if either of us smoked. He said no (which was a lie) and I honestly said no. When she left the room, I asked him why he lied when our daughter was in crisis. He did not have time to answer because the nurse walked in. My daughter's test results indicated nicotine in her system. He said he did not think it was untruthful because he never smoked around her, he always went outside. The nurse had a few choice words for him and walked out. The respiratory therapist later educated him about the chemicals that absorb into your clothes and skin when you are a smoker. My daughter spent 10 days in the PICU, 4 of them on a ventilator. She made a full recovery.

Have him Google and learn what he's doing to himself and everyone around him.\n\nGo ahead and downvite me, smokers. It doesn't make it less true that you're screwing the rest of us over against our will.", "The doctor's post is all you need.

Have him use a \u2018smoking jacket\u2019 (a jacket or sweater he wears while he smokes), that he takes off immediately when he comes inside. Also for him to wash his hands with soap and water and some gum is also a good idea if you\u2019re concerned about it on his breath. That\u2019s plenty of precaution. My best friend is a smoker and this worked well for us when she was over helping with the baby.

But I can understand his hurt from being made to take a full shower, especially if she's not usually awake when he gets home.\n\nYes, third hand smoke is a thing, but the primary danger of it is the build up over time and the oxidation. Even the dozens of articles various people have already posted don't recommend a full shower. Whatever smoke got through his clothes to land on his skin from that one cigarette (besides things in direct contact like hands) is not an appreciable danger. Wash hands, definitely. Even face. Have him change shirts. But having him fully shower every night before he can hold his child is a little extra.", "NTA. I\u2019m a father of three and I\u2019m also a smoker, there is no excuse to expose your kids to toxic smells and residue such as cigarette smoke. I would have kicked my own ass if I expected to hold my 3 month old after having smoked. If you choose to smoke, then you have to choose to deal with some consequences.

Who grew up in the era when people were encouraged to smoke.", "There\u2019s absolutely 100% validity to her concerns and you sound like a smoker in denial.", "That\u2019s called a survivors bias", "Well, I was three months premature. A baby before me was stillborn. Great\u2026", "Its not just his hands. That smell and the chemicals will be on all of him and your daughter will breathe them in. He needs to quit.", "I'm sorry you lost your Dad\u2764\ufe0f\n\nSo well done on quitting, the more so because it got harder, tobacco co's learned how to make nicotine more addictive\n\nI wish you a long, happy & healthy life with your wife & any present/future kids", "I mean I have never smoked in my life because I heard it can kill you. Yet people still smoke. So I assume they are lacking some key info or don\u2019t take it too seriously.\n\nWhy I think a discussion is needed", "Case in point.", "Just when I thought you couldn\u2019t get any dumber, you go and say something like this. That\u2019s the end of my statement. This isn\u2019t a Dumb and Dumber moment. You\u2019re already both.", "Source? And it has to be something legitimate that you could find on an archive like pubmed.gov.

A shower is overkill. If she is going to be this anal about it, he wasn\u2019t the person to have a kid with.", "Most people that smoke I'd say probably grew up around it as I have. I smoked in my earlier years but quit to get healthier. My whole family smoked on both sides and none of us had any issues between about 15 cousins.  So we never saw it as an issue the same as most of the world doesn't. We only know our experiences and until today I didn't even realize 3rd hand smoke could be harmful. I'll just say that I think it's more rare than you think for smoke to really harm a child or I think I'd see atleast 1 fucked up,  can't breath or deformed cousin by now. I'm not saying it's not dangerous as I know it is now but what I'm saying is unless it was effecting the masses, enough attention won't be drawn to it for it to matter. If 3/4 babies around smoke suffered, people would quit, but from life experiences most people come to see that it did nothing noticeable to anyone in their families until their old and dying reguardless. If people drop a baby it may die, so people tend to try very hard not to drop babies,  if 3rd hand smoke was as dangerous as dropping a baby then enough attention would be drawn to it for the masses to be educated on it and know better.", "Yupp and unless you had studies done to find out what caused it, seems easier to just blame smoking. Not saying smoking isn't bad but just saying shit happens.  Yes you can avoid chances of shit happening but sometimes even that doesn't matter. People smoke for 60 years without lung cancer, then people smoke nothing their entire lives only to end up with lung cancer at 40. The way I see it, if you want to give up everything unhealthy to get a better chance of them being healthy, you'd have to give up almost everything people do and eat, it's all dangerous.  Do you drink from plastic water bottles, use perfume,  clean with cleaners? Welp not if you want to eliminate all the hazards. It's easy to say to give up smoking for a child but it's an addiction and most don't see an immediate effect so don't understand the harm it may cause. Truth be told I didn't even know 3rd hand smoke was a thing until this post,  and I'm assuming most of the world doesn't either. Reality is, most people aren't going to quit smoking when they have a child as it'll most likely be the most stressful times of their lives.", "Third hand smoke is actually a very real danger. Which is what clings to clothes, skin, hair etc. It isnt overblown. In fact I developed asthma and got really sick as a baby because of it .my parents had quit by the time my older brother was born. But the third hand smoke stuck around in the house. That's an anecdote but it's also been proven scientifically it isn't good.", "Thanks, I just wish he'd been around to meet them. And I want to be around to see mine finish college and have kids.", "You are using a logical fallacy called \"bifurcation\". Nothing is 100%, so you claiming an outlier example means nothing and is anecdotal to boot", "I think for me i\u2019d just expect that from my partner (if he smoked) but yeah i guess some people are different and maybe don\u2019t realise how bad it is. Although i\u2019m not sure how you can not realise and so maybe it\u2019s actually just a lack of care about their child", "From your article:\n\n\"Thirdhand smoke builds up on surfaces over time. It can become embedded in most soft surfaces such as clothing, furniture, drapes, bedding and carpets. It also settles as dust-like particles on hard surfaces such as walls, floors and in vehicles.\"\n\nSmoking outside, hopefully wearing clothes. The smoke particles would become embedded in those clothes, especially if the person frequent smoker. I couldn't tell you if 100% of those pollutants would come out in the wash if they only wore it once while smoking. But we also have to keep in mind it's super common to not wash clothes after wearing them once, so that can build up even more and may not totally wash out.\n\nSo the clothes worn while smoking that are now embedded with smoke particles, which will be right in the face of a 3 month old baby, on their head, their clothes, their hands which inevitably go in their mouth.", "Wow, you\u2019re a piece of work. Your views are harsh. I agree, as you can see, that she should have handled it differently. But, as people here testify, there is danger in smoking, even 3rd hand. Remember: those who judge without mercy will be likewise judged.", "Yeah the whole thing about a survivors bias is that you only know from your experience and the information available. New information is always going to become available, just because it wasn\u2019t a known issue then doesn\u2019t mean it wasn\u2019t harming anyone there is a huge spike of respiratory, heart and other health problems shown in children of smokers. The information is becoming available as the data shows as the children of smokers grow and have children.

She simply has no right to withhold her child from her husband for invalid reasons.", "Yeah, just blows my mind that I'm 32 and this is the first I'm hearing about 3rd hand smoke being dangerous. Like how new is this and how can people like me, with the same access to all this information as you,  come to learn this instead of being ignorant.  Like unless everyone decides to hop on reddit and get into a debate like this how do you find this shit out? This doesn't seem like something you'd have to look up but rather be common knowledge that people pass around. Just all blows my mind man.", "Risks that my doctors and my daughters are aware of and watch for we\u2019re all clear here thanks", "Yes but you imagining how bad something will affect something isn't really science, per se. What is science is that breath particulates are only detectable for 90 seconds after last puff (that's mentioned in [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4765971/)). So we can reasonably assume that'd mean that every smoker is breathing out 30-60 seconds worth every time they come back, depending how far they are from the room. That would affect you if there were a lot of smokers, smoking multiple times, and with this new *actual information* you could make a concrete recommendation that smokers chill for 2 mins before coming back inside. This info, being info instead of imaginings, could help you. (I learned this breath fact during this hell-thread and didn't know it when I made the original comment so if you want you can consider it a very partial retraction)."]}
