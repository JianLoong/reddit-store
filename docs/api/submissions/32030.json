I have a 13yo son named Colby with my ex husband. Last year my son desperately wanted to go to Japan because his father currently lives there and my son had been there multiple times for visits during the summer and fell in love with it. He begged me to let him live with his dad for a year and while it broke my fn heart and gave me extreme anxiety, I agreed. I couldn't say no. He went there for a year and came back home in August of this year. As many could imagine, Japan has much different cuisines than the US does and while my son wouldn't complain about anything I put in front of him, he did make a few comments about missing Japanese dishes. So I went through a few websites, got a hold of his dad, etc and I was able to get some of the ingredients and recipes shipped out to me. His favorite one is some type of noodles with a dark brown spicy sauce. I can't remember the name off the top of my head but since it's his favorite, I have his father send me out the noodles and sauce so my son can prepare it for himself at home, as well as buying him the fresh ingredients needed. \n\nWell, me and my husbands daughter (9) asked Colby the day before yesterday if she could have some of his noodles. He said no. He only said no because he's made the dish for her before and she wasted the entire thing because it was too spicy. So she doesn't like it and therefore he said no and reminded her that she didn't like it. Before my daughter could even respond, my husband pipes up with \"give her some, there's no reason why you can't share\". So I stepped in and said no, and that she's already had it and threw it in the trash and this is his food. He doesn't have to share his food. He just kind of walks off. Well, this morning my son asked where all of his noodles were (4 packages) and my husband says \"I ate them\". I asked why TF he would do that and he said \"because I wanted to\". To me this felt like a big \"fuck you\" because I told him my son didn't have to share his food, so I did lose it. He did this on purpose. I just know it. I told him he was a fucking pig on a power trip and he should be ashamed of himself for eating my son's food. He says I'm ridiculous and I'm an AH for calling him a pig (because he's overweight) simply because he was hungry and wanted to eat. Everyone else says I'm an AH too, as I said.

It belongs to your son and your son only. He does not have to give it to anyone he doesn't want to as it's a gift from his father. \n\nI really think you need to have a private conversation with your son, away from your husband, and ask him if your husband treats him poorly when you're not around. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the answer was yes. \n\nAlso, eating four packages of noodles in one sitting just to dominate your 13 year old son is both a pig thing to do, and extremely immature. It's the equivalent of licking all the cookies so no one else can have one.\n\nETA: If you choose to stay in this marriage, get your son a lockbox or safe that he can store his non-perishable food items in.

Your husband was not only a total asshole for eating it, it was an act of cruelty and aggression, meant to deprive your son of something he valued. I would bet there have been other incidents of this kind of aggression in your household as well.\n\nMy advice is to get some couples counseling to make this work, it won't get better on its own, or get the hell out now before more hurt is inflicted.", "You have a responsibility to protect your son from the man you chose to marry.

I'd touch base with your son to find out if he's felt his step-father being hostile towards him in other ways.
