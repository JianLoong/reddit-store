However, literally everyone I've spoken to is against me on this because \"it's just food, I would never make someone feel like shit over food, blah blah\". So, here I am.\n\n30f. I have a 13yo son named Colby with my ex husband. Last year my son desperately wanted to go to Japan because his father currently lives there and my son had been there multiple times for visits during the summer and fell in love with it. He begged me to let him live with his dad for a year and while it broke my fn heart and gave me extreme anxiety, I agreed. I couldn't say no. He went there for a year and came back home in August of this year. As many could imagine, Japan has much different cuisines than the US does and while my son wouldn't complain about anything I put in front of him, he did make a few comments about missing Japanese dishes. So I went through a few websites, got a hold of his dad, etc and I was able to get some of the ingredients and recipes shipped out to me. His favorite one is some type of noodles with a dark brown spicy sauce. I can't remember the name off the top of my head but since it's his favorite, I have his father send me out the noodles and sauce so my son can prepare it for himself at home, as well as buying him the fresh ingredients needed. \n\nWell, me and my husbands daughter (9) asked Colby the day before yesterday if she could have some of his noodles. He said no. He only said no because he's made the dish for her before and she wasted the entire thing because it was too spicy. So she doesn't like it and therefore he said no and reminded her that she didn't like it. Before my daughter could even respond, my husband pipes up with \"give her some, there's no reason why you can't share\". So I stepped in and said no, and that she's already had it and threw it in the trash and this is his food. He doesn't have to share his food. He just kind of walks off. Well, this morning my son asked where all of his noodles were (4 packages) and my husband says \"I ate them\". I asked why TF he would do that and he said \"because I wanted to\". To me this felt like a big \"fuck you\" because I told him my son didn't have to share his food, so I did lose it. He did this on purpose. I just know it. I told him he was a fucking pig on a power trip and he should be ashamed of himself for eating my son's food. He says I'm ridiculous and I'm an AH for calling him a pig (because he's overweight) simply because he was hungry and wanted to eat. Everyone else says I'm an AH too, as I said.

It belongs to your son and your son only. He does not have to give it to anyone he doesn't want to as it's a gift from his father. \n\nI really think you need to have a private conversation with your son, away from your husband, and ask him if your husband treats him poorly when you're not around. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if the answer was yes. \n\nAlso, eating four packages of noodles in one sitting just to dominate your 13 year old son is both a pig thing to do, and extremely immature. It's the equivalent of licking all the cookies so no one else can have one.\n\nETA: If you choose to stay in this marriage, get your son a lockbox or safe that he can store his non-perishable food items in. And possibly even a small fridge with a lock on it as well if there are any perishable items that need refrigeration. Because I guarantee you, this is only the beginning.", "NTA. Yeah, ok, it's food. BUT it's special food. And maybe food that can't be had in certain places unless one is lucky enough to live in an area that has a *real* Japanese restaurant or Asian market that is accessible. Where I live you'd be SOL if you wanted real Japanese food or the ingredients to make it. \n\nAnd anyway, it's not just food, it's your son's property, sent to him by his father. Your husband was not only a total asshole for eating it, it was an act of cruelty and aggression, meant to deprive your son of something he valued. I would bet there have been other incidents of this kind of aggression in your household as well.\n\nMy advice is to get some couples counseling to make this work, it won't get better on its own, or get the hell out now before more hurt is inflicted.", "You have a responsibility to protect your son from the man you chose to marry.  This should be a wake up call to set very clear expectations and to file for divorce. NTA unless you fail to protect your child.", "NTA - your husband is the AH for purposely finishing the noodles meant for your son which he knows has been shipped in all the way from Japan specifically for him. He also knows that you do not get these specific noodles where you\u2019re located. It\u2019s very obviously a power thing done specifically, in his opinion, to \u201cteach your son a lesson\u201d for refusing your daughter the noodles.", "NTA for the most part. You had every right to blow up on him. He was on a power trip for sure. You were good to call that out. You should just use different wording maybe.", "NTA... this WAS a power trip. He is absolutely an AH.  I hope there are consequences for his actions. He treated you and your son with disrespect.", "Man, some of these posts are wild.\n\n\"My husband pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot me. He even pulled the trigger, but the gun misfired so I'm ok. But after that, I noticed the gun had a little scuff on it.  He's very proud of how well he takes care of his gun; AITA for pointing out the gun wasn't perfectly polished?\"\n\nThat's what this sounds like to me... not so extreme, but you get the idea. And if I have to spell it out, you're NTA and your husband, and your marriage, and his relationship with the kids... is a far, far, far bigger issue than some stupid and very replaceable noodles, for which he's an AH for eating but also, that's about 10,000th on the list of his issues to address.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's retaliating against a *child* because he got told no. He wants to establish that whatever he says, goes. He's also making it crystal clear that he wants to favor his bio-daughter over his stepson. And of course he diverted it to try to make it seem like you were insulting his weight, because the narcissist *never* accepts blame and responsibility.\n\nIn my eyes, this is instant divorce. You've probably gotten accustomed to certain things and so from the inside it might be a lot harder to see just how bad things have gotten, but I guarantee you, if you want what's best for your kids, you divorce this guy ASAP.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sure is. As someone else said this is divorce territory.", "NTA - As others have said, this was a power trip. He didn't eat one meal, he ate (supposedly) all the noodles - knowing how important those were to your son. Whoever is saying you're an asshole is wrong, and if it were my son - I'd let him order Japanese food for delivery or take him to a restaurant to make-up for your husband's lack of etiquette, empathy and/or common sense.", "NTA. It clearly was on a power play. It was an FU statement. You have every right to be mad at him. It's not about the food, it's about what he did just to be petty, vindictive for no reason other than your son not wanting to share something with his half (I assume) sister that he knew she didn't like.", "NTA. Your husband sounds insane for playing power games over his 13yo step child, then denying the obvious reasoning behind it and getting into an argument with you about it. I hope he doesn't normally treat your son that way.", "Definitely a power trip by husband because you said your son didn\u2019t have to share his special food. NTA and that\u2019s unbelievable to me how an adult can be so spiteful..", "Yikes!  Yeah, your \"husband\" had no reason to eat the food that was specifically set aside for your son.  Does your \"husband\" even like your son?  I feel sorry for the kid, to be honest.  No, you didn't over-react.

This was 100% a power trip, and you should be on the lookout for other ways he\u2019s mistreating your son. I would bet he didn\u2019t even eat the noodles, just threw them out. I won\u2019t jump to saying \u2018divorce him\u2019 but you should definitely be taking a long, hard look at your relationship.", "Your husband\u2019s behavior is probably why your son wanted to stay with his father for a while(someone else suggested this and it made a lot of sense).\n\nYour husband is extremely jealous of your son and you need to act now. NTA for calling him what he is", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds like an unbearable and immature AH. \n\nIt's probably not even just a food to your son, but a connection to his father. Man... This makes me so mad.", "NTA. Your husband was being a dick.", "NTA. These were bought and shipped out from Japan by his father and no one but your son should be eating it. Your husband decided to act like a child instead of being an adult and teaching his daughter that she can\u2019t have everything she wants. Hopefully your ex can send Colby some more snacks and food from Japan, you might be able to order something similar from them or see if Amazon or even places like HMart or 99 Ranch Market if there are any near where you live and definitely keep it somewhere safe that only Colby can get access to it.", "YTA\n\nHow many people need to tell you what an A you were in this situation before you accept it and do something about it? You husband told you, the people who know you personally told you, so now you turn to the Reddit world for what? Confirmation. Well, YTA.\n\nI'm betting your husband's money goes, in some part, to the food your household survives on. I'm inclined to believe that there are times when prepared food is rejected and must be thrown out. You selfishly decided that no such risk should be taken with your carefully selected food, or your son's. Your husband was angered at the audacity of your assertion so he drove home the point by being the necessary asshole right back to you.", "NTA\n\nSee if you can't send your son back to his father (for safety sake) while you divorce this pig.", "NTA - That be theft your husband has committed. Given your husband will steal from your flesh and blood, you might want to consider if you wish to remain married to a thief", "I'm pretty sure he would lick all the cookies just so no one else could have one. We were already on the fast track to divorce honestly.", "Instant divorce? You're ridiculous", "That is a great idea! It could be what happens ANY time he does that. She takes the two of them out for Japanese (if available nearby) every time her husband pulls some bs with his food. They may not have those noodles, but probably have plenty of other things he would like... and it's not cheap either, which would probably wear him down a bit faster.", "Can you explain this reasoning more because I don't understand it.", "I sincerely think it's time to pull the trigger on it. I guarantee you he's either been doing or saying things without you knowing to put your son down. \n\nBased on the entire situation, it sounds like he spoils his daughter and got pissy because someone was saying no to her. And if that's the case, as she hits her teen years, life is going to simply get awful in that household.", "This is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nI would bet the marriage is miserable, and the son is being subtly as well as not so subtly mistreated."]}
