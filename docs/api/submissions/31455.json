Every year since we've been married, we give Christmas gifts to our parents, siblings, their spouses, and my husband's grandparents and one of his cousins (who is like a sister to him). 16 people total (14 adults + 2 children). As my siblings have gotten married and the family has expanded in recent years (which is a great problem to have!), the Christmas budget has consistently exceeded $1500 just for gifts every year. Last year was our baby's first Christmas, and we felt stretched pretty thin on the budget. I ended up having to work a lot of extra shifts to cover these expenses, and I had less time at home with my new baby. My husband and I also realized that we were putting together these super long Christmas wish lists of things we really didn't want or need just to make sure that everyone had a fair chance to buy something from the list.  \n\n\nThis year, instead of getting gifts for everyone, we want to do a \"secret Santa\" situation where we draw names from a bowl and get assigned to get a gift for just one person on each side of the family, in addition to our own spouse and child. So essentially getting gifts for 5 people rather than 16. We feel that we would be less stressed and we'd be able to focus on celebrating with our child, which is much more important to us than receiving gifts. We would even be willing to get everyone small gifts, like framed photos or baking some treats, if everyone just wants something to open. We just don't want to go out to a store and spend more money on bigger gifts. It just doesn't seem sustainable to buy gifts for so many people every year. My side of the family was very agreeable to this plan, as they have also struggled financially in the past. My in-laws, however, are not so happy. Their side of the family is much smaller, so they don't see the problem with getting gifts for everyone. When we tried to talk to them about this plan last night, we were still asked about our Christmas wish lists. We both said \"We are not doing wish lists this year\". Because we truly do not want them to feel pressured to buy us anything. But we were immediately yelled at for \"not doing Christmas at all this year and ruining it for everyone\".   \n\n\nAITA?

I've never understood why anyone should ever put themselves in a position to go through financial chaos for this.  Re-read your message and ask yourself if this is what Christmas should be about. Christmas is \"ruined\" to those relatives because they don't want to give to everyone.  They just want to take from you.  For reasons like this, we only give gifts to children and pets and not expect anything back. I couldn't handle petty adults anymore. NTA.", "I am one of 9. (7 siblings and some of my cousins grew up with us.) My siblings seem to have 1,000 children and they also have romantic partners. I am glad we are adults, frankly. The minute my siblings started having families, I focused my gift giving on their children. I usually just try to do something considerate and special to celebrate birthdays. But, my point is none of us is made of money. And we have all made our peace with that.\n\nWe literally sat down and had a chat about gifting for the kids. And then my little sister pointed out that some of us don't have kids and so nothing is ever going to be equal or equally reciprocated. She made a salient point.\n\nOnly spend what you can afford. And as kids age out of being treated like they are super special, enjoy getting to keep some of your money for you. NTA. This would make me feel like a hamster running on a perpetual wheel of not reasonable.\ud83e\udd23", "NTA. This is not just a problem with your family. In general the holidays have come to be synonymous with gift-giving when, IMHO, they should really be about family. Spending time with loved ones, with or without a gift exchange, should be the real focus.", "NTA. Maybe they just want to \"keep traditions going\" but still 16 is a lot of people. Especially with a new baby. If you're comfortable to discuss the finance/extra hours part of it with them, then maybe you should (give them the why and maybe they will understand) If not, you don't really need to explain yourself if you don't want to but it might smooth things over with them.\n\nI would say I want to concentrate on time together, rather than gifts. New baby = new traditions.", "NTA...And your idea of baked treats and framed photos sounds wonderful.  You're likely reading other people's minds as well. It's difficult to be the person who gets the ball rolling, but you're half way there!", "NTA. That side of the family sounds like entitled, spoiled brats. Completely detached from reality. It's been a tough few years for everyone, and you have a new baby... It's insane that they would demand this from you.", "NTA. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to buy everyone gifts, that\u2019s a lot of people and a lot of money to be spending. I don\u2019t even understand why this is such a big deal to your husband\u2019s family, because gift giving shouldn\u2019t be more important than just spending time with family. I think the Secret Santa idea is awesome, that\u2019s what we do in my family and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family because we can\u2019t afford to get everyone gifts.", "NTA- my family has always had everyone buy the kids a gift, and adults have a secret Santa. Around age 16 we make a show of the kids \u201cgraduating\u201d to the secret Santa and no one throws a fit. I can\u2019t imagine trying to buy each adult a gift, especially finance-wise", "Christmas isn't about going into debt!!!!!!!  Louder for the in-laws.  Your suggestion was a perfect solution to the issue and for them to literally yell about it - these people have no concept of what Christmas is truly about.  I wouldn't even feel comfortable celebrating with them if they are just in it for the money/gift. We only buy for the kids and do name drawing for adults.  That's it.  NTA  Stick to your guns - you will NOT regret it.", "When we had our daughter we stopped buying gifts and started having her make gifts for grandparents and aunts/uncles. We still bought for the kids", "NTA. It's reasonable to set that boundary. As each generation is born and new families are formed, I think traditions need to shift and change anyway. His parents got to run their lives how they see fit, but they can't run yours. You two need to start doing holidays how you want to for each other and your child. \n\nAnd the minute anyone yells at me for not doing what they want, is the minute all compromise goes right out of me. I would hold your boundary. They can grow up.", "NTA. I also come from a huge family so feel your pain. \n\nPersonally I\u2019m at the age where if I want something I\u2019ll buy it myself and if I haven\u2019t bought it for myself then either I don\u2019t want it or it\u2019s too expensive to buy for me as a gift. \n\nMartin Lewis aka Money Saving Expert aka probably the most influential person in the UK summed up it perfectly for me \u201cThe best gift is the gift of releasing people from the obligation of having to buy for you.\u201d", "NTA\n\nWhy not do an adult gift swap plus children gifts? Adult gifts swap and children gifts $100 each? \n3 gifts - $300.  \n\nOr implement gift money limits if you want to give individual gifts - each person gets a $25 gift? \n$25 x 16 = $400. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t like secret Santa because there\u2019s also the one cheapskate who gives out the gas station gift  or \u201cforgets\u201d their gift. \n\n16 people is a lot - I\u2019m in a big family too (4 siblings) and my husband (only child) and I set a strict budget for what we spend on each person. \n\nYou\u2019re not ruining Christmas.

I told my spouse that I don\u2019t want to spend a couple of grand every year on gifts, can we just draw names and do the kids. Finally, a couple of years ago they agreed due to the pandemic and it stuck. Such a sense of relief.

Candles and slippers and ugly Christmas sweaters and serving platters and gloves and knick-knacks. It's just wasteful! OP and her husband are much better off putting that money towards their child's college fund, and not having to work overtime to afford gifts. \n\nI do enjoy presents and I think they're a very nice part of Christmas, but the holiday season is much more than that.
