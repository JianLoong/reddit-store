{"id": 30046, "submission_id": "17knxoz", "title": "AITA For asking my SIL if she has a degree in psychology", "selftext": "This past weekend, my SIL, Suzy (24F) came over to visit my wife (30F) and I (34M) for dinner and drinks.  Suzy had recently broken up with her boyfriend of 2 years and it seems like the sole purpose of her visit was to vent about him.  No matter how many times my wife or I tried to change the subject or talk about something else, Suzy would find a way to bring it back to her relationship and ex-BF.  \n\nAfter about an hour of hearing about Suzy's ex, I left the room and wandered off to find something else to occupy my time.  But shortly after that, my wife came and asked me if I could start dinner earlier than we had planned because she was getting hungry.  We have a pretty large island counter in our kitchen and Suzy and my wife sat there drinking wine while I was cooking.  \n\nAgain, every single word out of Suzy's mouth was about her ex.  And it wasn't just normal badmouthing.  She was using a bunch of clinical and therapy buzzwords like narcissist, gaslighting, toxic, disregarding boundaries, etc.  I tried to change the topic multiple times but to no avail.  I tried turning on music to drown out Suzy's psycho-babble, but she just talked over it.  I finally told them that maybe they would be more comfortable on the couch instead of on bar stools, but Suzy insisted she wanted to watch me cook even though she hadn't paid any attention to anything other than her wine glass or her ex-bf.  \n\nAt one point, Suzy described something her ex had done and asked me if it sounded like something a narcissist would do.  I told her I wouldn't know because I'm not a psychologist and I don't think I've ever really interacted with a narcissist.  She insisted on me giving my opinion and I deflected again.  After she insisted a third time, I asked her in a very sharp tone \"Do you have a degree in psychology, Suzy?  Are you a therapist?  Or are you just regurgitating terms you heard on Tik Tok?  Just call your ex a fu#$ing asshole and move on or get out of my kitchen, my God.\"\n\nMy wife pretty much immediately scolded me and Suzy just sat there for a second before calling me an asshole and walking away, followed quickly by my wife.  I had to finish cooking so I couldn't go after them.  Eventually, just my wife came back and told me that Suzy had gotten an Uber home because she no longer felt welcome for dinner because of what I did.  \n\nI told her that I had politely tried to redirect the conversation multiple times and even gently asked them both to leave the room so I could cook, but Suzy insisted on goading me about my opinion on something that I care literally zero about.  \n\nMy wife told me I should have just humored Suzy because she's going through a breakup and needed a safe place to vent.  I told her that there's a line between venting and just spewing therapy buzzwords, and Suzy was definitely way to one side of it.  I told her I tried to remove myself from the conversation multiple times, but Suzy kept insisting.  \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1698766809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17knxoz/aita_for_asking_my_sil_if_she_has_a_degree_in/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your wife wants to take on that role of confidant and lend an ear, fine, but she can't force you to also listen to Suzy vent for hours  on end.  That's not a reasonable ask. Your wife needs to learn to read the room and not rope you into things you clearly don't want to  be a part of.\n\nGoing with NTA. Not your circus, not your monkeys.", "NTA.\n\nI dont get all the ah votes. you tried multiple times all night long to redirect the conversation and talk about something else and all she wanted to do was berate her ex and your not into that. \n\nyou left to get away from her because your bored and sick of hearing her whine and complain. who wouldnt be.\n\nbut your wife couldnt do it alone so she had to rope you back in so she didnt have to suffer alone.\n\nthen she kept going on and on and on while you tried to cook. you again tried to change the topic multiples times and she still didnt get the hint that you were tired of hearing about the ex. \n\nyou were a lot nicer than i was. i would have ended the topic after the first hour let alone 2. \n\nif she wanted to talk about her ex thats fine, but you didnt need to be there. its fine to complain about an ex but she went beyond that and was just usuing buzzwords and berating someone that wasnt there to defend themselves.\n\nshe needs to get over herself. you endured more than anyone should have to. you were far nicer than i would and she should have taken the hint when you tried man, many times to change the topic and left that you didnt want to listen to her complain about the ex.", "I feel like there was a lot you could have tried in between polite redirection and what you ended up doing.", "NTA", "\"She was using a bunch of clinical and therapy buzzwords like narcissist, gaslighting, toxic, disregarding boundaries\"\n\nWas she using these commonly used terms  inaccurately?", "Clearly Suzy can\u2019t read the room. NTA", "NTA. Ignore all the critics here. You have a right to limit toxic talking that goes on and on...and on. It's a drain and a downer to the listener. Suzy needs to get over herself, and get a grip. Some venting, yes...but not hours worth! Maybe your reaction will help her think twice from now on. Your wife needs to also set some boundaries...unless she likes listening to someone venting for hours. In which case she should leave you out of it.  \nAnyway you have a right to set your boundaries. You weren't unreasonable about it, as far as I can see.", "YTA. A family member is going through an emotional time and looking to vent, and you swear at her, insult her, and make her feel unwelcome. You're in your 30s, you should know how to have some patience and act like an adult. \"I care literally zero about what she was talking about!\" ... what, so you get a free pass to be a jerk? She's your guest, you and your wife invited her. Sometimes guests are boring or annoying or not entertaining you, fine. You stay polite until they leave and then don't invite them back. It's clear from your post you just don't like her, and you used that as an excuse to be rude.", "NTA\n\nwe all have traumas and continued venting is just not productive.", "NTA - You asked them to \u201cvent\u201d elsewhere instead of the kitchen island but instead she continued.", "YTA. She\u2019s a family member who is going through the breakup of a long-term relationship. Would it have killed you to be sympathetic or give some noncommittal responses? Everyone goes through a phase after a breakup when they just need to vent in order to get it out and move on. Or are you the kind of person who\u2019s only interested in a conversation if it\u2019s about them?", "NTA. Suzy didn't want an opinion, she wanted validation.\n\nShe sounds insufferable btw I have a friend very similar and I hate dealing with them. All they want it to have their opinions validated and if you put up any resistance/differ in opinion, they shut down and act like you slapped them in the face.\n\nAnyone saying \"she was going through some stuff/just suck it up\" is part of the problem imo. Just because someone has a bad time doesn't mean they get to steamroll everyone around them and force them listen to their issues. \n\nOP REPEATEDLY tried to move the conversation - even mentioned his wife did too - and Suzy CONTINUALLY disrespected that boundary. So, it's OK for her to do that but not OP? \n\nSomeone venting for HOURS isn't normal. I understand being upset and needing to vent but if you're going to do for multiple hours, you need a reality check or to have cleared that with the people you're venting to beforehand. \n\nThat sort of negative energy being spewed at someone would make anyone snap after a while. Could OP have been nicer? Yes. Was that something Suzy maybe needed to hear? Also yes. \n\nSuzy needs to learn that not everyone wants to hear you b\\*\\*ch for hours on end.", "Damn, Suzy sounds like a Redditor :D\n\nI'm going to go with NTA, but that was a little harsh.", "YTA\n\nSIL clearly needed to vent - did it really kill you that much to let her?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a freaking psychologist or have a degree in psychology to know what gaslighting is.  Or when boundaries are disrespected.  For Christ\u2019s sake, if you didn\u2019t feel comfortable saying the word \u201cnarcissist\u201d and wanted to say that her ex sounded like an AH - say that!\n\nTelling her she has to use the words *you* permit, or get out of your kitchen, was absolutely over the line.  There\u2019s a lot of room between \u201chumoring\u201d your SIL, and telling her to get out.", "Sometimes just let people vent lol.", "Eh, YTA. I've seen plenty of people to complain about their exes for hours. It helps them to get out of their system and move on. Is it pleasant to the listener? No. Did I stick around for the sake of my friends or even acquaintances? Yes.\n\nNow if she did this all the time, that would be different. But this was one occasion. One.\n\nYou are no psychologist either to tell people how to process their breakups.", "Nta. This whole situation sounds like it should have been a girls night. That way they can chat and vent and all that. \nSorry you got sucked into that BS.", "How is anyone justifying this behaviour !! Swearing at a guest or anyone is just unacceptable. She obviously is hurting and isn\u2019t picking up on social cues because she\u2019s not doing ok. I understand the frustration but act like an adult and talk to your wife when Suzi is gone about maybe not inviting her over again for a while so she can heal and you don\u2019t have to hear about it", "YTA, but you didn't have to be. Suzy sounds really annoying but you could have easily avoided this whole mess. Sometimes \"I'm sorry you had to go through that/you were hurt\" goes a long way.", "Oh yes those psychological terms like disregarding boundaries \ud83d\ude44 YTA you should have just let her vent to her sister. It wasn\u2019t hurting you. Oh no you had to be annoyed for a couple hours\u2026 poor baby.", "\"I was an asshole, AITA?\"\n\nYep, YTA.", "YTA. Suzy sounds annoying but you didn\u2019t have to be to rude in getting your point across.

Let\u2019s put him behind us for a bit, he doesn\u2019t deserve any more of your time tonight.\u201d", "NTA and your response was classic.  I love the \"call him a f\"ing AH or get out of my kitchen.\"  If i wasn't broke I'd give you an award for that.", "YTA\n\nI mean she sounds insufferable and I\u2019m unsure how your wife even stayed attentive in the conversation for so long. \n\nHowever, there are better ways to speak to your family members and acknowledging their feelings rather than dismissing them and calling it bullshit and insinuating she needs a degree to be able to speak on what happened in her relationship. Maybe she was using terms all Willy nilly, but you didn\u2019t have to make her feel so belittled about it.", "*< she's going through a breakup and needed a safe place to vent >*\n\nI understand that.\n\nBut your wife could have had dinner with her sister alone, knowing you, her husband, wouldn't want to be one of the persons SIL was going to be venting to.\n\nNTA", ">\"Do you have a degree in psychology, Suzy? Are you a therapist? Or are you just regurgitating terms you heard on Tik Tok? Just call your ex a fu#$ing asshole and move on or get out of my kitchen, my God.\"\n\nYTA.  Which you already know because your wife told you.", "Sometimes family needs to vent,and she feels at ease with you two to do it, was it too much ? Probably, but if you felt uncomfortable, you should have straight away said I am not feeling comfortable with all the ex bf talk, could you go to the next room? When someone is hurt,it is not the time to go on and correct their perception or their use of terminology, you just listen or ask them straight forwardly to not vent to you. Which you didn't do. So YTA", "YTA.\n\nWhy was that necessary?  Why did it bother you so much?  The poor girl is going through something and needed to rant with her sister.  Why did it get your panties so twisted?  Let the girl vent, and learn how to communicate without being a complete AH about it.", "YTA\n\nShe is hurt, and she needs to vent. Everyone does it. Look at you.  You're upset and basically came to reddit to vent about it. \n\nAlso, you don't need a degree in anything to figure out when someone is gaslighting you or to know that they don't respect your boundaries.", "YTA. Maybe excuse yourself from the conversation and left wife and SIL make dinner for themselves.  Or tell wife & SIL directly you want to change the subject and stop talking about SIL's ex because it's a waste of time.", "Yta you didn't think to ask her tonstop before name calling?  'Hey, SIL, I really don't want to hear any more about that jerk.  If you want to keep watching me cook, please talk about something else.'", "YTA - gaslighting, toxic, boundaries aren\u2019t really psychological terms. Without knowing what she said exactly, can\u2019t tell if she was misusing them.\n\nDid you ever *directly* tell her that you didn\u2019t want to talk about her ex? She had a decent break up and was venting. You need to be direct instead of passively trying to change the subject.", "YTA. Damn let her vent. Stop trying to \"remove yourself\" from supporting family members through emotionally difficult time periods. Who cares if she's using the right terms? She's not prescribing him treatment.", "NTA\nThe more you fuck around, the more you find out lol", "Nta. It is actually one of my pet peeves people calling someone a narcissist or a gaslighter without them being a narcissist or gaslighter and it is a BIG trend that has been going around for a while is really unnecessary. I think what you said was justified", "ESH\n\nYou but only because you rudely responded and could have been more diplomatic.\n\nHer pressing for you whether you think he is a narcissist is neither here nor there. If that is what she was asking she wasn\u2019t just looking for validation or support, but for you to join in on labelling him with terms you\u2019re not authorised to use, which is out of line.\n\nYour wife for basically scolding you for not responding in a specific way. Your SIL was asking for your opinion, yours. Your wife doesn\u2019t get to tell you what your opinion should be especially if it enables the continuation of a topic which is dragging the mood in your own home or requires you to do something you fundamentally disagree with.\n\nSo I do agree with the spirit of your reply (just label him an asshole and be done with it) but the way you phrased it was too stern and didn\u2019t read the tone well which causes you to also fall into the muck.", "YTA. In pure hard cold numbers, how long was she really going on about it? An hour plus maybe halfway through cooking? Also who cares if she\u2019s so mad she\u2019s gotta keep talking about it? And why so hung up about the \u201cclinical\u201d terms? \n\nBluntly, you sound upset and judgmental more about her use of Tik Tok and those specific terms, and not because she\u2019s not a psychologist and uses them. So without using that excuse, why does that upset you to the point of losing your temper? Because whatever it was, it caused you to fail to treat someone else as a human being. And that\u2019s a big problem with your conduct, not hers.", "NTA.  I understand that Suzy is deep in her hurt, so that's all she can focus on, but sometimes I think people get addicted (for lack of a better term), to that release/anger/whatever it is that they achieve when venting.

She's your wife's sister and your wife chose to humour her because she needed a safe space.\n\nIs it sometimes irritating when you try to change the subject and the other person won't take the hint? Sure.\n\nBut the fact she was using words like narcissism and gaslighting isn't some kind of extenuating circumstance that makes it okay to be an AH to her.", "Sorry, but YTA.  I get why you were annoyed, and I don't think speaking up (in a less insulting way) was a bad idea, you just took it way too far.  \n\n Pointing out that you guys aren't therapists is good and had you worded a couple other points differently it wouldn't have been bad.  Like saying it sounds like tik tok therapy instead of saying she's regurgitating terms she heard.  She may even have liked  \"let's just call him a fucking asshole\".  The last line though was just too far.  That kind of meanness didn't fit the situation.", "ESH.  Suzy wouldn\u2019t let it go but geeze, just mumble whatever she wants to hear and go about your dinner prep.", "YTA", "YTA. This woman is sad and angry and came to her sister for support. would it have killed you to humor her for one night?", "\"I don't think I've ever really interacted with a narcissist\"...\n\nOh you do, every single day of your life.", "NTA. You tried to stick it out and when you couldn't, you removed yourself from the conversation. When roped back into a public space, you tried politely to change the conversation and then tried to get them to relocate. I do think your words were harsh, but not out of line. You didn't curse at Suzy or call her anything nasty, though I'm sure your tone wasn't the best.\n\nI think this can be a great opportunity to talk to your wife, though. I'm sure this won't be the last time you're in a situation where you're trying to give subtle, socially polite cues to convey your discomfort or needs to your wife. You both should be able to pick up one another's cues and respond accordingly, and your wife dropped the ball with the relocating from the kitchen one. If she's just that oblivious, then you gotta work with her to figure out a good compromise where you're still polite and she's able to pick up what you're putting down. Otherwise, you may just need to drop the social niceties and stick with \"I'm not the best person for this conversation and don't want to be a part of it\" as a catchphrase. \n\nAlso, might not be out of line to apologize to Suzy and ask for an apology. Regardless of your intent, you did make her feel unwelcome in her sister's home. Then ask for an apology since she ignored our polite attempts out of a conversation and made you uncomfortable. That's rude in itself, too, and you'd like to avoid being put in that position again in the future.", "I think everyone failed a bit here so it's ESH rather than Y T A.

She should read the room. I may vent to close a girlfriend (no sisters) but I would chill out if her boyfriend/husband was around assuming he doesn't want to hear it. \n\nAlso, your wife should have read the room as well and noticed that you needed space. She could have had them move to the other room or tried to redirect the conversation while you were present.", "NTA\n\nYou're not completely innocent, you could've used some mild words considering the situation. However, you did give specific hints to show your disinterestedness in the topic and it looked like your SIL was there just to talk to your wife mostly. I haven't been in a relationship but I'm pretty sure you don't need 2 people to talk to. She was fine with your wife so they should've had no problems sitting on the couch and ranting over there. Also, me and my mother, when we cook, we also hate any distraction including the TV so I understand how you felt", "NTA. Why is it that annoying behavior never seems to be a good reason to be honest? And then the honest person gets blamed and called an AH?", "I think ESH simply because OP went 0-60 quickly and SIL really wasn\u2019t picking up what OP was throwing down. \n\nIt sounds like it was really just the buzzwords and having to listen to venting (which most people agree is cringey) that made him mad.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your house, your evening and you are a male, so probably heard a lot of sexist bullshit which would have been \u201ctriggering\u201d please do excuse the therapy lingo. \n\nThey should of gone out for dinner, most women (including myself) know that if you want an honest answer, you ask a man, if you want sympathy and to continue feeling victimised, ask a woman. Maybe not your mother and sisters as they might tell you more truth than you\u2019d like to hear too \ud83d\ude05\n\nI also agree, that the absolute overkill of the term narcissist and other diagnoses are TikTok drivel.

Sometimes they cannot. \n\nPsychologists are skilled but still cannot diagnose, so you were being gentle asking about a psychology degree rather than a medical degree. \n\nMaybe could have been more gentle and might be worth apologising via text.

Suzy had recently broken up with her boyfriend of 2 years and it seems like the sole purpose of her visit was to vent about him.  No matter how many times my wife or I tried to change the subject or talk about something else, Suzy would find a way to bring it back to her relationship and ex-BF.  \n\nAfter about an hour of hearing about Suzy's ex, I left the room and wandered off to find something else to occupy my time.

You certainly need to have a pointed discussion with her.", "I agree with you about not forcing, but OP was not chained down and forced here. The SIL is clearly an emotional wreck and the wife wanted to be there for her, in her own house. \n\nIt is clear OP didn't want to be apart of it but there were so many things he could have done before exploding on SIL.

They are married, I don't get why people are making it seem like it is crazy to have your partner there and not read their mind that they are upset. The way I see it, the SIL is at a 10/10 emotionally, in life, in stress, whatever, and that seems very clear. OP being annoyed at that is like a 2/10. It would be hard to \"read the room\" with one person being overly distressed compared to the other that hasn't shared they are distressed.", "He tried.

The couch might be more comfortable is too indirect... He went from too polite to too agressive", "He tried, over and over again.  And when everything he tried didn't work, he was *still* going to just grin and bear it... until she asked him a question, and his polite answer wasn't good enough for her.  She pushed and prodded and goaded him until he gave the honest answer she was seeking.  Don't ask questions you don't want the answers to.", "Except he only did that because she kept spewing words she probably didnt know the meaning of she kept bothering him and he politely kept trying to deflect or ask her to move the conversation your acting like he straight told her to fuck off immediately", "He wasn't direct about it, which if you are in your feelings,you might not pick up on as an indirect attempt to make you leave the room.", "> Would it have killed you to be sympathetic or give some noncommittal responses? \n\nThis is literally what OP did, but Suzy wouldn't accept them.", "Why does her 'need' to vent a) let her force OP into actively participating, and b) override his desire not to listen to random venting?", "But you expect him to use her words in his kitchen?  So people like Suzy determine the vocabulary of the world, in their house, your house, social media?  Strong NTA: my home is my castle, my time off is my time off and if you choose to avoid my polite cues to fuck off or shut up then you will get a clearer one.  Strong NTA.", "In fairness, he didn't tell her how to process it. He asked her to not vent about it in his kitchen. He literally asked her to NOT do something. This is NOT the same as telling someone how to do something.", "> \"I'm sorry you had to go through that/you were hurt\"\n\nI had already said some version of that about 3-4 times that day.", "OP is totally TA I agree but I just want to point out he\u2019s also just flat wrong when none of these are really diagnoses or \u201cclinical terms\u201d.", "Why is this downvoted???", "And so does his wife.", ">Psychologists are skilled but still cannot diagnose \n\nThis is dependent on the jurisdiction.   Psychologists can diagnose where I am, but they can't give prescriptions.", "Exactly. At no point did he say- I\u2019d like to talk about something other than your ex. Can we please move on from this conversation topic.", "Why do people think they get a free pass to be an asshole just because the other person in the story wasn't a saint? Insulting, swearing at and getting aggressive with a houseguest because you're bored by their conversation makes you an asshole. Period. Adult conversations don't work this way.", "Yeah, but how dense can you be to not realize that OP didn't want to be involved? First OP tries several times to direct the conversations elsewhere before Suzy forced the conversation back to shit-talking her ex. OP then decided to just not be around, and they followed him to the kitchen to watch OP cook. OP gently suggested they take the conversation to the couch. They did not. Suzy starts hounding OP with questions despite OP trying to deflect or redirect. These are clearly actions of someone that doesn't want to be involved, yet Suzy continued after OP until OP's frustration got the better of him.", "And when she pressed you, you could have said that again together with the \"I'm not a therapist/I don't know\" remark. You didn't have to go berating her. She was looking for support/confirmation that her feelings are valid.", "Because that's the culture of AITA.  There's this weird perception that if someone is remotely annoying or out of line, going nuclear on them is suddenly warranted.", "actually he did. he says that he tried many, many times to change the subject and the sil kept bringing it back to herself. how many times should he have kept changing the subject. 10, 15, 40? when is it enough. should he have to endure a 4hr berate session of the ex.", "He says several times before he started cooking dinner and while he was cooking dinner that he tried to change the subject and deflect. Suzy just wasn't having it.", "Why do people think they get a free pass to dump their trauma on anyone in earshot? They tried a couple of times to get off the subject, and she kept going.\n\nShe mistook OP's kitchen as a therapist's office.", "Nope.\n\nOP tried several times to remove himself from a situation he actively didn't like: Suzy shit-talking her ex and hijacking conversations to bring it back to shit-talk her ex. OP tried to direct the conversation to other topics, OP left the room all-together, OP even suggested (after his wife and suzy followed him to the kitchen) that the couch would be a more comfortable place to vent. Each time, OP was unwillingly roped back into a conversation he wanted no part of. If I were in OPs shoes at that point, I'd have probably done something similar, seeing as several attempts to remove himself from the situation had not worked, directly calling Suzy out would be the only way to resolve the issue. \n\nSuzy is an AH. OPs wife, to a lesser extent, is an AH. OP is NTA.", "It sounds more like she was looking for attention, ranting for hours when you're a guest in someone else's home, ignoring social cues when your ranting is making others uncomfortable.", "I disagree. If you look at it from the perspective of the SIL, she's just come out of a relationship where she's obviously felt very mistreated. Pretty normal to rant about it with family and friends and to want support from loved ones. It doesn't make her an attention-seeker."]}
