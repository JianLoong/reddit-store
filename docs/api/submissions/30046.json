{"id": 30046, "submission_id": "17knxoz", "title": "AITA For asking my SIL if she has a degree in psychology", "selftext": "This past weekend, my SIL, Suzy (24F) came over to visit my wife (30F) and I (34M) for dinner and drinks.  Suzy had recently broken up with her boyfriend of 2 years and it seems like the sole purpose of her visit was to vent about him.  No matter how many times my wife or I tried to change the subject or talk about something else, Suzy would find a way to bring it back to her relationship and ex-BF.\n\nAfter about an hour of hearing about Suzy's ex, I left the room and wandered off to find something else to occupy my time.  But shortly after that, my wife came and asked me if I could start dinner earlier than we had planned because she was getting hungry.  We have a pretty large island counter in our kitchen and Suzy and my wife sat there drinking wine while I was cooking.\n\nAgain, every single word out of Suzy's mouth was about her ex.  And it wasn't just normal badmouthing.  She was using a bunch of clinical and therapy buzzwords like narcissist, gaslighting, toxic, disregarding boundaries, etc.  I tried to change the topic multiple times but to no avail.  I tried turning on music to drown out Suzy's psycho-babble, but she just talked over it.  I finally told them that maybe they would be more comfortable on the couch instead of on bar stools, but Suzy insisted she wanted to watch me cook even though she hadn't paid any attention to anything other than her wine glass or her ex-bf.\n\nAt one point, Suzy described something her ex had done and asked me if it sounded like something a narcissist would do.  I told her I wouldn't know because I'm not a psychologist and I don't think I've ever really interacted with a narcissist.  She insisted on me giving my opinion and I deflected again.  After she insisted a third time, I asked her in a very sharp tone \"Do you have a degree in psychology, Suzy?  Are you a therapist?  Or are you just regurgitating terms you heard on Tik Tok?  Just call your ex a fu#$ing asshole and move on or get out of my kitchen, my God.\"\n\nMy wife pretty much immediately scolded me and Suzy just sat there for a second before calling me an asshole and walking away, followed quickly by my wife.  I had to finish cooking so I couldn't go after them.  Eventually, just my wife came back and told me that Suzy had gotten an Uber home because she no longer felt welcome for dinner because of what I did.\n\nI told her that I had politely tried to redirect the conversation multiple times and even gently asked them both to leave the room so I could cook, but Suzy insisted on goading me about my opinion on something that I care literally zero about.\n\nMy wife told me I should have just humored Suzy because she's going through a breakup and needed a safe place to vent.  I told her that there's a line between venting and just spewing therapy buzzwords, and Suzy was definitely way to one side of it.  I told her I tried to remove myself from the conversation multiple times, but Suzy kept insisting.\n\nEDIT:  So, my wife and I just had another conversation about this.  Suzy called her last night and had another breakdown about the break-up, but revealed a few details which she had not shared with my wife previously.  Apparently, Suzy's ex found her \"Finsta\" (I'll admit I don't know what that is.) and broke up with her after reading the messages she was getting and sending from other guys.  My wife said she laid into Suzy pretty hard for pretty much lying to us by leaving out a pretty big bit of information.  My wife ended up apologizing to me for how Suzy acted and I apologized to my wife for my reaction as well.  Needless to say, I don't think Suzy will be coming over for dinner again any time soon. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1698766809, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17knxoz/aita_for_asking_my_sil_if_she_has_a_degree_in/", "score": 2366, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your wife wants to take on that role of confidant and lend an ear, fine, but she can't force you to also listen to Suzy vent for hours  on end.  That's not a reasonable ask.

NTA", "NTA. Ignore all the critics here. You have a right to limit toxic talking that goes on and on...and on. It's a drain and a downer to the listener. Suzy needs to get over herself, and get a grip. Some venting, yes...but not hours worth! Maybe your reaction will help her think twice from now on. Your wife needs to also set some boundaries...unless she likes listening to someone venting for hours. In which case she should leave you out of it.  \nAnyway you have a right to set your boundaries. You weren't unreasonable about it, as far as I can see.", "YTA. A family member is going through an emotional time and looking to vent, and you swear at her, insult her, and make her feel unwelcome. You're in your 30s, you should know how to have some patience and act like an adult. \"I care literally zero about what she was talking about!\" ... what, so you get a free pass to be a jerk? She's your guest, you and your wife invited her. Sometimes guests are boring or annoying or not entertaining you, fine. You stay polite until they leave and then don't invite them back. It's clear from your post you just don't like her, and you used that as an excuse to be rude.", "NTA\n\nwe all have traumas and continued venting is just not productive.", "NTA - You asked them to \u201cvent\u201d elsewhere instead of the kitchen island but instead she continued.", "YTA. She\u2019s a family member who is going through the breakup of a long-term relationship. Would it have killed you to be sympathetic or give some noncommittal responses? Everyone goes through a phase after a breakup when they just need to vent in order to get it out and move on. Or are you the kind of person who\u2019s only interested in a conversation if it\u2019s about them?", "NTA. Suzy didn't want an opinion, she wanted validation.\n\nShe sounds insufferable btw I have a friend very similar and I hate dealing with them. All they want it to have their opinions validated and if you put up any resistance/differ in opinion, they shut down and act like you slapped them in the face.\n\nAnyone saying \"she was going through some stuff/just suck it up\" is part of the problem imo. Just because someone has a bad time doesn't mean they get to steamroll everyone around them and force them listen to their issues. \n\nOP REPEATEDLY tried to move the conversation - even mentioned his wife did too - and Suzy CONTINUALLY disrespected that boundary. So, it's OK for her to do that but not OP? \n\nSomeone venting for HOURS isn't normal. I understand being upset and needing to vent but if you're going to do for multiple hours, you need a reality check or to have cleared that with the people you're venting to beforehand. \n\nThat sort of negative energy being spewed at someone would make anyone snap after a while. Could OP have been nicer? Yes. Was that something Suzy maybe needed to hear? Also yes. \n\nSuzy needs to learn that not everyone wants to hear you b\\*\\*ch for hours on end.", "Damn, Suzy sounds like a Redditor :D\n\nI'm going to go with NTA, but that was a little harsh.", "YTA\n\nSIL clearly needed to vent - did it really kill you that much to let her?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be a freaking psychologist or have a degree in psychology to know what gaslighting is.  Or when boundaries are disrespected.

I've seen plenty of people to complain about their exes for hours. It helps them to get out of their system and move on. Is it pleasant to the listener? No. Did I stick around for the sake of my friends or even acquaintances? Yes.\n\nNow if she did this all the time, that would be different. But this was one occasion. One.\n\nYou are no psychologist either to tell people how to process their breakups.", "Nta. This whole situation sounds like it should have been a girls night. That way they can chat and vent and all that. \nSorry you got sucked into that BS.", "How is anyone justifying this behaviour !! Swearing at a guest or anyone is just unacceptable. She obviously is hurting and isn\u2019t picking up on social cues because she\u2019s not doing ok.

I love the \"call him a f\"ing AH or get out of my kitchen.\"  If i wasn't broke I'd give you an award for that.", "YTA\n\nI mean she sounds insufferable and I\u2019m unsure how your wife even stayed attentive in the conversation for so long. \n\nHowever, there are better ways to speak to your family members and acknowledging their feelings rather than dismissing them and calling it bullshit and insinuating she needs a degree to be able to speak on what happened in her relationship. Maybe she was using terms all Willy nilly, but you didn\u2019t have to make her feel so belittled about it.", "*< she's going through a breakup and needed a safe place to vent >*\n\nI understand that.\n\nBut your wife could have had dinner with her sister alone, knowing you, her husband, wouldn't want to be one of the persons SIL was going to be venting to.\n\nNTA", ">\"Do you have a degree in psychology, Suzy?

Probably, but if you felt uncomfortable, you should have straight away said I am not feeling comfortable with all the ex bf talk, could you go to the next room?

Let the girl vent, and learn how to communicate without being a complete AH about it.", "YTA\n\nShe is hurt, and she needs to vent. Everyone does it. Look at you.  You're upset and basically came to reddit to vent about it. \n\nAlso, you don't need a degree in anything to figure out when someone is gaslighting you or to know that they don't respect your boundaries.", "YTA.

If you want to keep watching me cook, please talk about something else.'", "YTA - gaslighting, toxic, boundaries aren\u2019t really psychological terms. Without knowing what she said exactly, can\u2019t tell if she was misusing them.\n\nDid you ever *directly* tell her that you didn\u2019t want to talk about her ex? She had a decent break up and was venting. You need to be direct instead of passively trying to change the subject.", "YTA. Damn let her vent.

She's not prescribing him treatment.", "NTA\nThe more you fuck around, the more you find out lol", "Nta.

I think what you said was justified", "ESH\n\nYou but only because you rudely responded and could have been more diplomatic.\n\nHer pressing for you whether you think he is a narcissist is neither here nor there. If that is what she was asking she wasn\u2019t just looking for validation or support, but for you to join in on labelling him with terms you\u2019re not authorised to use, which is out of line.\n\nYour wife for basically scolding you for not responding in a specific way. Your SIL was asking for your opinion, yours. Your wife doesn\u2019t get to tell you what your opinion should be especially if it enables the continuation of a topic which is dragging the mood in your own home or requires you to do something you fundamentally disagree with.\n\nSo I do agree with the spirit of your reply (just label him an asshole and be done with it) but the way you phrased it was too stern and didn\u2019t read the tone well which causes you to also fall into the muck.", "YTA. In pure hard cold numbers, how long was she really going on about it? An hour plus maybe halfway through cooking? Also who cares if she\u2019s so mad she\u2019s gotta keep talking about it?

I understand that Suzy is deep in her hurt, so that's all she can focus on, but sometimes I think people get addicted (for lack of a better term), to that release/anger/whatever it is that they achieve when venting.

She's your wife's sister and your wife chose to humour her because she needed a safe space.\n\nIs it sometimes irritating when you try to change the subject and the other person won't take the hint?

I get why you were annoyed, and I don't think speaking up (in a less insulting way) was a bad idea, you just took it way too far.  \n\n Pointing out that you guys aren't therapists is good and had you worded a couple other points differently it wouldn't have been bad.  Like saying it sounds like tik tok therapy instead of saying she's regurgitating terms she heard.  She may even have liked  \"let's just call him a fucking asshole\".

You tried to stick it out and when you couldn't, you removed yourself from the conversation. When roped back into a public space, you tried politely to change the conversation and then tried to get them to relocate. I do think your words were harsh, but not out of line. You didn't curse at Suzy or call her anything nasty, though I'm sure your tone wasn't the best.\n\nI think this can be a great opportunity to talk to your wife, though. I'm sure this won't be the last time you're in a situation where you're trying to give subtle, socially polite cues to convey your discomfort or needs to your wife. You both should be able to pick up one another's cues and respond accordingly, and your wife dropped the ball with the relocating from the kitchen one. If she's just that oblivious, then you gotta work with her to figure out a good compromise where you're still polite and she's able to pick up what you're putting down. Otherwise, you may just need to drop the social niceties and stick with \"I'm not the best person for this conversation and don't want to be a part of it\" as a catchphrase. \n\nAlso, might not be out of line to apologize to Suzy and ask for an apology. Regardless of your intent, you did make her feel unwelcome in her sister's home. Then ask for an apology since she ignored our polite attempts out of a conversation and made you uncomfortable.

She should read the room. I may vent to close a girlfriend (no sisters) but I would chill out if her boyfriend/husband was around assuming he doesn't want to hear it. \n\nAlso, your wife should have read the room as well and noticed that you needed space.

Also, me and my mother, when we cook, we also hate any distraction including the TV so I understand how you felt", "NTA. Why is it that annoying behavior never seems to be a good reason to be honest? And then the honest person gets blamed and called an AH?", "I think ESH simply because OP went 0-60 quickly and SIL really wasn\u2019t picking up what OP was throwing down. \n\nIt sounds like it was really just the buzzwords and having to listen to venting (which most people agree is cringey) that made him mad.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your house, your evening and you are a male, so probably heard a lot of sexist bullshit which would have been \u201ctriggering\u201d please do excuse the therapy lingo. \n\nThey should of gone out for dinner, most women (including myself) know that if you want an honest answer, you ask a man, if you want sympathy and to continue feeling victimised, ask a woman.

Suzy had recently broken up with her boyfriend of 2 years and it seems like the sole purpose of her visit was to vent about him.

I finally told them that maybe they would be more comfortable on the couch instead of on bar stools, but Suzy insisted she wanted to watch me cook even though she hadn't paid any attention to anything other than her wine glass or her ex-bf.  \n\nAt one point, Suzy described something her ex had done and asked me if it sounded like something a narcissist would do.
