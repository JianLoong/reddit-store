I bet a lot of people need donations nowadays.\n\nNAH.", "NAH\n\nDon't just throw them away.   Sell them.\n\nShe deserves her dream kitchen, but there's no reason to just throw away perfectly good appliances.", "NAH-youre being reasonable in your thought process and you yourself recognize that it\u2019s her money to spend.\n\nSee if you can sell the appliances already there to get some money back. Also, maybe discuss budgeting and a timeline for some of the furniture that Is important to you.", "Happy wife = Happy Life", "NTA.  You\u2019re allowed to have an opinion, but as long as she\u2019s making her own money, she should be able to spend some of it on things for herself too.  Without knowing your finances, I\u2019d say she\u2019s entitled to spend some of her earning even if you don\u2019t agree on the functionality.", "Are you sure it will only cost $4000?\nHave you tried making a list of things that need fixing/ replacing and prioritizing them?", "Sell them.", "My stankiest, nastiest, favorite pair of sneakers are still perfectly functional. I don't let my wife anywhere near them.\n\nNAH.", "It doesn't sound like anyone is TA per se. You guys just have different viewpoints. I think home purchases are a major point in life where married couples have disagreements. \nIts not unreasonable for her to want a dream kitchen.  $4000 isn't breaking the bank type of budget either so she seems within her reason to want it. \nYou also mentioned she works and would be paying for it herself. Let her get what she wants in this scenario.", "Nsh. I was in the same spot that your wife was in when we bought our house. I used the crappy appliances until they crapped out and replaced them with what I wanted (stainless) as they crapped out. Once they were all replaced I redid the cabinets and countertops for more space, saving us from having to drop a crap ton of money at once. Took about 4 years before it was done. Get some use out of them, save money in the meantime or use it on more pressing items needed to live comfortably. You both need to sacrifice the instant comforts to live long term comfort. But you both need to realize it to make it work.", "NAH. \n\nI work in family law. I watch love die between a lot of couples. Bickering over genuine issues, in a respectful way, ain\u2019t a big catalyst. \n\nAt the end of the day, if you\u2019d like my advice: Argue a bit, but let her have the kitchen if you can afford it. Maybe haggle down how many appliances are at issue.  Can\u2019t say I have enough context to know the right solution, but this really is just a normal couple argument.", "NAH - also hard to know without seeing what you\u2019re replacing and if you can afford it or not based on tori budget, income, etc. \n\nTbh tho if we\u2019re talking resell value, depending on how idk the appliances are, you\u2019d want to replace them to something modern.", "NAH. This is purely a financial/aesthetic decision. The appearance of your kitchen goes a long way towards how you feel using it. Imagine, for example, if all the appliances were a a collection of mismatched, eye-turning shades. Vomit green, fluorescent orange, canary yellow, and cobalt blue, for example. Would you be happy with that kitchen?\n\nMaybe you would be, especially if the cost to replace was $4,000. But you also might not be happy with it, and agree that replacing them is necessary. \n\nThe only thing different is that the appliances are white instead of garish. Is that worth the money? Ultimately that's a subjective decision. Personally I'd be inclined to sign off on it, especially if my wife had to compromise on what she really wanted for that space. But it's ultimately a personal decision.\n\nIf the appliances are still in good condition, though, you can likely sell them and recoup some of that $4,000, so the true cost of the replacement will be less than $4k.", "Just went though this.\n\nNAH, just different opinions. Can I suggest a compromise? We set up timelines for acceptable \u201cremodel/replace\u201d on rooms and furniture. Like 1 year, 3 year, 5 year goals. That way we weren\u2019t rushed and both agreed nothing would change before 1 year.\n\nGet through that window of supplemental tax bills first. They\u2019re fun.", "NAH.\n\nDo the kitchen appliances all need to be swapped out at once?  Could a compromise be that you replace one or two now, and buy some furniture, and then wait until your finances allow you to do more?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t try too hard to push the idea that your proposal is more practical, and therefore you should do it your way.  You\u2019re not wrong to want furniture first.  She\u2019s not wrong to want her new appliances first.", "NAH but life is short and the aesthetics of the places we live in matter. If she is the one who spends more time in the kitchen using the appliances, I think her opinion should have more weight (and if you are, then your opinion can have more weight). If this is the one mildly frivolous thing she wants, I think it is reasonable. Plus, it will increase the value of your house.", "You know, she has already had to compromise on the kitchen. You're planning a lot of work that sometimes is best done *after* the appliances are replaced. So If you can swing it, now would be a good time.\n\nBut I totally agree on the aaaarrrghhh stainless steel! I have never spent so dang much time polishing anything as I do these stainless appliances! \n\nNAH", "NAH: I wanted stainless steel everything too, but what we did is replaced everything over time when it did brake. The stove is the last thing to go that\u2019s white but it\u2019s still kicking after 10 years lol. So I shall wait.", "NAH.  Can the appliances be swapped out gradually over time, and sold second hand to recoup some of the $$$?", "Stainless steel sucks.  Fingerprints everywhere.  White appliances are just fine.", "NTA, but as long as you can work it into the budget, what's the problem? I'm sure you don't absolutely need new countertops either, but you're replacing those.", "NAH, but as a homeowner myself, tell her and yourself to WAIT A YEAR before you do anything to the house. Just wait. The appliances will do the job in the meantime. Why are you waiting? Because the time after buying a house tends to suck up your available cash, and you want to have at least a small cushion in case anything breaks between the time you get the keys to the time you're ready to replace things. Besides, it's Black Friday season already, the installers are gonna be booked out for weeks. Even if you buy new appliances now, there's every possibility that you might not get them for another month or two.\n\nAnother mistake you're about to make (that you already made, but too late now if you're closing) was to buy a house that you need to do a lot of work before you can functionally use it. Both of you work at least full time, but you think you're gonna DIY a kitchen remodel on top of that? Sure Jan. \n\nDon't start changing the house, save your money, use the winter to plan your remodeling project and price out what you're going to do, buy appliances next year in August because Labor Day always has big appliance sales, and just relax and enjoy your holiday season without stressing yourself out more with a half-done, unusable kitchen. JUST WAIT! Get an inexpensive island  if you need more storage and counter space.", "NAH. You both have different viewpoints and that's fine. If she can afford it and it won't put you in the red, then she can go for the new appliances. Just sell the old appliances so you can offset the costs.\n\nI would add that it may also be more practical to buy new appliances for the kitchen because it is a different size from your current one. It would be easier to choose items that fit better in the smaller kitchen.", "NAH", "4K is not gonna get you all that\u2026at least not quality\u2026budget a little more and do it. Nah but she deserves what she wants if it doesn\u2019t break the bank", "NTA.  IMO replacing perfectly functional appliances with new nes bc of their appearance seems so frivolous.  After having had stainless steel for 8 years or so, I was thrilled to go back to white.  Stainless shows every single fingerprint!  Every time!\n\nThe first commenter prolly has got a great idea! Sell them!  But really, the finger prints - UGH!\n\nTo be fair, what have you wanted for the house that might not necessarily be a have-to-have for the house?  Gotta be something!", "NAH", "NAH.\n\nWe bought a house a couple years back and I've learned a couple of times already that making a new-to-us house into a home is kinda expensive  :)\n\nMy wife and I don't look at our home the same way - she sees it as a direct reflection of her skills and taste and she wants a home she can be proud of.  Me, as long as I have a place to sleep I'm good  :)", "N T A \n\nbut she's also right. White appliances are super dated and can throw off the whole kitchen. Just put it on the list. When u finish the kitchen then do the appliances", "NTA. Different opinions and honestly she should realize with all the costs this far it's a bit much but definitely something to do in the future once you're resettled.", "I know it\u2019s a long shot but if your wife is crafty there is actually a way to make the existing ones look like stainless steel. [Here](https://youtu.be/YcWjnY6eULw) is a video. Even if it doesn\u2019t look perfect, you won\u2019t have them forever and she can get the real deal when they crap out! Maybe a workable compromise? Either way, NAH, I totally get her desire and her excitement, but it\u2019s not the smartest choice just yet.", "NAH\n\nIf she can save up 4K to replace the appliances, she should do so. I agree that the other things in the house take more precedence than replacing working, expensive appliances.", "I can 100% tell you ppl are looking for all 4 of those things on Facebook market & OfferUp. NAH, sell them, make money to get the new furniture", "INFO: Do you guys have shared finances?", "NAH, although you're sailing a bit close to being TA in the final paragraph - this isn't you thinking \"more practically\" versus your wife's plan being \"really dumb\" it's just that you have different priorities. I'd probably pick a bigger sofa over stainless steel appliances too but it really is just a preference. \n\nThe only way to fix this is a respectful conversation with your wife. You could sell the existing white goods and might find new appliances are more efficient to offset some of the cost. It sounds like you're pretty handy, so perhaps you could look at giving some of the appliances a makeover? You've said yourself that your wife has already made compromises about the kitchen so, unless the two of you really can't afford her ideas, it seems only fair that you show a willingness to compromise too.", "I\u2019m only jumping on to say this: Actually GETTING the appliances may be incredibly hard and time-consuming. There are still a LOT of supply chain issues, and they are affecting both the price and time of getting things in right now.", "This is what my partner and I did. We had to replace every single appliance in the home we bought, but we stretched it out over a number of months.", "It's not me you have to convince!", ">you need to do a lot of work before you can functionally use it.\n\nI mean, everything works just fine as is. The house is well maintained, but just outdated. I'm pretty handy so am not worried about the minor renovation. It's also relatively inexpensive to do those things. The big bummer is needing to spend a ton of money on minor things (like steel vs white).", "Yeah, no.  This is the dumbest saying in the history of dumb sayings.", "It's NOT inexpensive to redo counters and cabinets and a backsplash, and it is NOT a minor renovation. If you think $4K is a lot to spend on appliances, then wait till you see how much materials have gone up.\n\nI would have a different answer if you knew this already and were planning on doing the remodel before you moved in, but, well, some people need to learn from their own mistakes. You'll see.", "Hard disagree. It's always the last place you look.\n\nOf course it is, why would you keep looking after you found it? \n\nWith a close second going to \"did you check your butt?\" when searching for a misplaced item.", "Planning on some of the newer, nice-looking laminate countertops, like this one: [https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ekbacken-countertop-white-marble-effect-laminate-40335628/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ekbacken-countertop-white-marble-effect-laminate-40335628/) So maybe $200 for those.\n\nNew sink \\~ $300, new faucet $200.\n\nBacksplash will be \\~$400 for the subway tiles + a bit of adhesive and grout. The cabinets are only getting painted, with around $50 worth of paint, and maybe $20 worth of new handles/hinges.\n\nSo I'm looking at less than $1,500 for the main renovation items.", "https://youtu.be/--9kqhzQ-8Q", "> It's always the last place you look.\n\nYeah, but this is true.  Happy wife=happy life is one of the most untrue sayings out there.", "You need to spend a whole lot more on cabinet paint than $50. A good primer is necessary (something high bond or oil based) and a quality enamel if you plan to DIY it. SW Emerald Urethane and Benjamin Moore Advance are good choices. Airless spray applications are best, but they can be brushed or rolled by hand as well.", "Good luck ever trying to sell that house. \u201cKitchen has a $200 IKEA countertop that I put in myself!\u201d \ud83d\ude44 Is this a manufactured home or did you just buy a room in a repurposed college dorm?", "Fair enough. Couple hundred for paint is still not what I would consider expensive."]}
