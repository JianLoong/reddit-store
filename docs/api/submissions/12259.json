Regardless of this one time event, it doesn't happen in a bubble. There's plenty of things that my husband does that \"hurt\" me that others would say is an overreaction, but if it's related to something that we've discussed before as something that *bothers* me, then guess what? It's now a hurt because it's not just minor.", "I see you make the universal rules to determine what can emotionally hurt a person\u2026\n\nPeople can be hurt emotionally for circumstances that aren\u2019t quite logical.

If I came home from a weeklong trip and my husband was asleep, I would be sad that I didn\u2019t get to interact with him the day I arrived, but I wouldn\u2019t guilt him for it.

Who are you to make the rules?", "Are parents who have to go on trips for work assholes? Are all military parents assholes?", "Where is the line that turns you into a monster? Is it at 3 days? 4?", "There is nothing wrong with a kid being away from one of their parents for a few days.  There'd also be nothing wrong with both parents taking a vacation together while the kids stay with grandparents for a week.", "Then I would say a good night of sleep and then thinking about why she's actually \"hurt\" or \"upset\" is in order.\n\nEmotions are always valid.\n\nReasons for them aren't.", "Dude went to bed at a reasonable time without knowing when she would be back.\n\nFeeling disappointed that you can't interact with somebody you love when you see them? Okay.\n\nBeing mad at them for being asleep when they need it? That's arrogance.", "As another commentor said:\n\n>...Disappointment is one thing, it\u2019s natural and that\u2019s fine; but being angry about it is entitled.

I love him and want him to take care of himself.", "That analogy is quite flawed, however I cannot quite put into words why.", "But they are using hurt in a metaphorical sense, not an absolute.\n\nIn your instance, the person who fell wouldn\u2019t normally say \u201cyour actions really hurt me\u201d days later. Even though it\u2019s technically correct, it implies something different.", "Oh, I agree. I absolutely agree with that.\n\nHowever, in this context with the information given, the wife is being totally unreasonable for taking personal offense at having her \"expectations\" let down.", "Isn't that this sub in a nutshell?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

You were hurt without your partner wounding you.", "Not at all. My point is that something can hurt someone without the other person doing a thing wrong. \n\nIf you didn't know where your significant other was and got scared or hurt, that feeling is valid even if they had left a note but you didn't find it because the dog ate it.

You were hurt because you had reasonably thought they left without a word.", "People come to this sub for additional perspectives.\n\nBut sure be difficult after being wrong.", "You haven't really explained why it makes them assholes.

Why would she be upset?\n\nShe built up expectations in her head and then got disappointed that they weren't fulfilled. He didn\u2019t agree to wait for her, Nobody knew when she was getting back. She didn\u2019t communicate that she wanted that.\n\nShe didn't have to say anything. There's nothing that would accomplish.

Well, to me, anyway. And taking personal offense to a dude going to sleep when you have no idea when you'll be home seems quite entitlted to me.\n\nIf she had said she was disappointed? I might go with NAH. But even then, why bring it up? What does this accomplish? Why not say \"I'm happy to finally see you again\" instead? This was just needless stirring of a pot.", "Nice edit, bud. Let's address those added in points.\n\n\n> People can be hurt emotionally for circumstances that aren\u2019t quite logical.\n\nAbsolutely. There's no denying that. And those emotions are *valid*.\n\nWhat isn't always valid are the *reasons for those emotions*.\n\n> You don\u2019t need to be a dick about it.\n\nCalling somebody out for unreasonable behavior isn't being a dick. Saying somebody is acting entitled or arrogant isn't being a dick.\n\nShe decided after a full night that she wanted to tell him how she felt (GOOD) and next time to stay up for her (BAD)."]}
