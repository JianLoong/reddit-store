She's upset that you dozed off? That seems unreasonable.", "You're NTA. If you're anything like most of us when we're exhausted, you would not have been in your sharpest, best mood when she got home if you had forced yourself to stay awake. What good would that have done? There was time in the morning when you would be fully awake to catch up and talk.", "NTA So you fell asleep. Big deal. Isn't enough that your wife was able to get away and away from the kids for a break? Instead of being mad she should be happy to see you and grateful you were able to watch the kids.", "NTA. You were tired and fell asleep. You did nothing malicious or cruel nor did you forget her. You practiced self care.", "NTA\n\nI go on several business trips throughout the year and I usually get home around 1am. I don\u2019t expect my husband to be up waiting on me. She knows you were busy taking care of the kids and were tired. All she had to do was to crawl in the bed with you and cuddle instead of being upset you didn\u2019t wait up for her.", "NTA.  When you are exhausted how do you avoid falling asleep?  It happens.", "NTA. It sounds harsh but it\u2019s not your fault that she built up expectations in her head and then is disappointed that they aren\u2019t fulfilled. You didn\u2019t agree to wait for her, she didn\u2019t communicate that she wants that. Also, she could have just waken you up when she got home to spend time with you.", "NTA. This is a strange thing to be upset about.", "NTA unless you were supposed to pick her up at the airport. I can understand how she might be disappointed because she missed you but she kinda needs to grow up and realize you were exhausted from the weekend.", "I read that as AITA for not WANTING My wife to come home from a trip\n\n\nBut having re read it.  NTA.", "I\u2019m not sure I understand all these \u201ccouldn\u2019t she have tried to wake you up\u201d comments. If I\u2019m sleeping, you better not wake me up. Great you were gone for five days. I\u2019ll see you on day six!!!", "NTA bc you're exhausted and it's not your fault.", "NTA I don\u2019t expect my husband to wait up for me when I go on trips. Our kids are exhausting and his migraines get worse with sleep deprivation and caffeine. I wait up for him though but I have trouble sleeping so it\u2019s super easy for me to do.", "NTA.\n\nIf you weren't picking her up and you wanted to sleep, go to sleep if the kids are sleeping", "NAH\n\nYou were exhausted and fell asleep. Reasonable. She thought you\u2019d be excited enough to see her that you\u2019d have waited up. Reasonable.\n\nRemind each other that it was a big week for you both and that you love each other, and organise a date night.", "NTA.\n\n\nYour wife is being unfair.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t understand why she didn\u2019t just wake you up if this was so important to her. This seems like a really petty thing to be upset about when she could have fixed the issue.", "NTA. She can be excited to see you and disappointed you weren\u2019t awake, but she could have woken you up. That would been an asshole move as well though. Unless you\u2019re in an uncomfortable position she should let you sleep.", "NTA. It's absolutely ridiculous that she would react this way. She chose to be gone for five days. She chose her return flight. She could have come home on Saturday or Sunday morning as that would have allowed more time together. She  wasn't thinking of you when she made her plans. All you did was go to sleep.", "NTA you all can talk the next day.", "You feel asleep because you were tired, not because you didn't care about her. She could just wake up when she got home. NTA.", "NTA, I can't imagine my partner ever expecting this from me nor would I expect it from her. If you're tired, sleep!", "NAH. You aren't an AH for falling asleep. She is not an AH for being excited to see you and disappointed that you'd conked out.", "NTA\nShe came home to a clean house and sleeping family after her week away with her adult friends.\nShe's upset there wasn't a welcoming party waiting for her? I'd feel a bit unappreciated and unfairly attacked if my spouse acted that way.", "Based on your last comment as well, no AH here, you both just seem to miss each other and want time together. Schedule some of that in!", "NAH, so long as you had your phone on in case of an emergency", "NAH\n\n\nIn my opinion no one is wrong here. Her wanting to be able to reach you if something was up and probably have missed you is valid. You being tired and sleeping is also valid.", "Did you get changed, climb into bed, turn out the lights and go to sleep at 8pm knowing she'd be arriving soon? In which case you probably could have waited up. Or did she get home and find that you had dozed off on the couch in front of the TV? In which case why didn't she just wake you up so you could catch up and go to bed together?  \nNAH.", "NTA. What is she is, a teenager?  Tell her to put her big girl panties on. Could she not wake you?", "Too much information missing to make a judgement \n\nDid you need to collect her from the airport?\n\nOf course it\u2019s tiring,regardless of if you are mum or dad", "NAH.  She got in at an unspecified time that ended up being really late, you weren't required to pick her up...and you were exhausted and fell asleep.  Not like you did it on purpose.", "NTA!\n\nIf I was your spouse, I would\u2019ve come home, seen you passed out on the bed that early and thought, \u201cAwwww\u2026the kids must\u2019ve tuckered him out.  I have such a great husband that he didn\u2019t mind being the solo parent for a couple days while I went out on my girl\u2019s trip.  I definitely owe him one.\u201d\n\nNot, \u201cHOW DARE he not stay up for me until I got home!!!\u201d\n\nHer reaction is a bit selfish and ungrateful, even if it\u2019s just coming from a place where she wanted to see you.\n\nI mean, if she *really* wanted you to wake up, there would have been ways of waking you up that would have been (ahem) mutually satisfying and a great way to reconnect.\n\nInstead, she chose to kinda throw a hissy fit?  Maybe she was jet-lagged and not thinking clearly, but she owes you an apology.", "NTA but I can see why she was upset. Doesn't negate the fact that you were exhausted.", "INFO: Could she have just woken you when she got there for a quick greeting/visit? Why did you have to wait *up?*", "NTA. She could have told you all about her adventures once you were well-rested in the morning.", "This sounds really childish to me, being mad about someone falling asleep. I do kinda get your wife wanting you to greet her and show excitement that she's back, but you're human and taking care of children is tiring so it's not a big deal imo. She could have woken you up and checked if you're able to spend a few hours to talk and have a good time with her, or just let you sleep and understand that you'll be there for her tomorrow.

Didn't she give you a kiss on the cheek when she got home, and said kiss would've woken you up?", "NTA for not being awake.", "Nah.  She was just hoping that you missed her a bunch. So much that you waited up and were excited to see her.  You didn\u2019t though.", "INFO\n\nDid you refuse to get up when she got home or something? Why was she upset that you were asleep? Were you ignoring messages from her because you were asleep? \n\nPerhaps she was just stressed from the delays and stuff and let out some misplaced anger.

You were very tired and fell asleep. Your wife was excited to see you and was a bit hurt that you fell asleep.
