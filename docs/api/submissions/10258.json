Fed is best. They can sense the stress, and you getting burnt out or PPD isn\u2019t worth it. You can pump, or formula whatever you\u2019re most comfortable with. Anyone else\u2019s opinions are just that, and they can keep them to themselves. You guys are doing great!", "NTA. Your house, your baby, your life, your rules.

I too have a rough time with my first child. She would not latch. It was like she was sucking fire through them. She\u2019s almost 18 now but I haven\u2019t forgotten that! \n\nOne thing that might help is checking to see if the hospital you gave birth at has a lactation nurse that might be able to do a home visit? Mine did when I had my youngest. They are really great at helping with techniques and showing you tricks. \n\nOne that always helped me was kind of squishing my boob , like sorta flattening it a bit, then you sort of roll the nipple into their mouth? You want to get their mouth as wide open as possible around your areola. \n\nIt\u2019s when they latch really tight directly on your nipple that you get that extreme irritation. And the wide mouth latch helps them get that good hind milk too. \n\nIf the baby latches too tight, just stick your finger in their mouth to break the seal, then try again. \n\nYour nipples will get tougher. I highly recommend trying to find a lactation nurse. Talk to your doctor about that. The lanolin ointment is good. There are also great nipple patches you can use in between feeds. \n\nAnd if you are finding that it\u2019s still not working for you, don\u2019t be afraid to either supplement or feed entirely with formula. A fed baby is best. \n\nThis is a hard time. You do what you have to.

Please make sure you are doing whatever works for you -- what YOU want and not what others pressure you to.", "NTA. Congrats on bringing a beautiful new baby into the world! With that being said, your house - your rules. You're not being publicly indecent and your family sounds like it doesn't respect boundaries. Moreover, it sounds like they have keys to the house, if they're seeing things they aren't expecting... If that's the case, consider changing the locks til your body doesn't feel like it's on fire anymore. Also, I'm super sick of people sexualizing female breasts when their actual purpose is only to sustain life.", "NTA. Your mom however is one. \n\nThey can start dictating what you\u2019re wearing in your house when they pay your bills and breastfeed your child. Till then they can keep their trap shut. \n\nWith that out of the way, as a dad, I can only salute all moms. I could never do what my wife did when she was breastfeeding our child. It is mentally, physically and emotionally draining. You\u2019re literally gifting life to your child.

It\u2019s an easy fix! \n\nLastly, your own mother being ashamed of seeing the body of the woman she created is just so odd. Maybe that\u2019s because my childbirth experience was traumatic and I needed my mom\u2019s help\u2026but we should be able to be vulnerable in front of and have the support of the woman who created us. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting this much heat from them, and going through this.
