If they told me they needed a place for the team (while my team is not there), I would have said no.  \n\nStill want them out.", "The supervisor of that construction has one but says he needs to finish a job before allocating the container. \n\nThat's why I said that it was not my job to provide his team work conditions. They don't even have a porter potty. Not even sure if it's legal.", "The company we hired asked us if he could stop the construction because the company has a deadline and needs all hands on deck. We were fine with it. They are paid on a monthly basis according to the amount of work they do. The company knows we agree to let the next door crew keep their things in our house. \n\n Construction is not ready to move in soon.\n\nWe told the other crew they would be responsible for the space.", "Even if you were just letting them store tools, you don\u2019t have any agreement with these people.  They aren\u2019t your friends.  You are lucky all they did was make themselves comfortable instead of stealing all your shit.\n\nNo offense (well, this is AITAH so I guess a little offense) but you are very stupid to have agree to this in the first place.  You are definitely NTA to ask them to remove their shit now.", "It isn\u2019t. They shouldn\u2019t be passing inspections if they don\u2019t have a portable toilet on site. And here the contractors pull their stuff around in trailers and take their tools home with them or lock them into the trailer overnight.\n\nYou are being taken advantage of. In this housing market contractors can name their price and he can rent a trailer or a storage unit. He\u2019s just going to pass the cost along to the owners anyway.", "In my community, the GC is required to provide a place for his/her workers and subs to eliminate.  Basically a porta potty.    \nYou are absolutely under no obligation to provide ANY services to the contractor of your neighbor.", "This sounds like something that didn't involve you from the get-go. You didn't have any say in whether the two teams work together. That's on them. Anybody leaving anything in your house leaves you open to problems. Ask the team not working for you to get their stuff out immediately, definitely.", "Nta At this point you need to contact your guys and tell them their collaboration has effected you and your property.  Ask them what he is referring to when he is telling you he can stop his side and bite you in the bum.  Tell them while they made private arrangements outside of your arrangements you were happy to stay out of it.  But since he is threatening you with some sort of consequences you had no part in, they need to come back and deal with this contractor.\n\nThen ring the guy and give him 24 hours to remove all their belongings from your property and return your key.  You don\u2019t have to put up with anything and especially when he is turning nasty on you.", "NTA", "The bit that would bother me is the sharing of materials (as well as having a bunch of strange contractors traipsing through my house). Sure OP\u2019s crew may be getting materials off the neighbour crew, but it also means that OP is paying for materials going into a stranger\u2019s build.  \n\nTell the contractors to be professionals and stop treating the 2 projects as some kind of new friend-finding scheme. If they like hanging out, they can do that on their own time.", "My team admits they were not as careful has they should have been, because it's supposed to be a safe neighbourhood. After the events, they begun fully covering all the entrances with wooden boards. \n\nAlso, in the beginning, they built a new room, and until they put the roof, if someone was really keen on getting in and was good at parkour, they would have found a way.", "\"This sounds like something that didn't involve you from the get-go. You didn't have any say in whether the two teams work together. That's on them.\"\n\nCompletely agree. The worst part was the guy making me feel like I own him something because of that. Which I called BS the second time. I'll probably talk to my team and tell them to avoid future collaborations, considering those will come to bite MY ass.", "It's a small town, my construction guy said is always good to be in good terms with the next door people. What they do on everyday it's up to them, I'm not gonna tell grown man who they can or can't talk to.\n\nWhat pisses me off, is that Mr.A has been made me believe that my construction would be impacted without the collaboration, which my husband calls BS. \n\nI might tell my team and my Engineer what happened and to try to avoid future entanglements.", "He made it seem like if they stop helping my guys, our construction would go slower. When I told my husband he had said that, by husband rolled his eyes and said: \"They need us more than we need them\". \n\nMy guy was saying how nice Mr.A's team is and helpful, just for Mr.A to come and tell me they help my guys with this and that. That's what rubbed me the wrong way. \n\nI'll warn my guy not to ask Mr.A'team any more favours.", "No sharing of materials. Our crew told me that on occasion they have lend/borrow tools. Like borrowing a pencil when you're at school.\n\nAnd yes, having a bunch of strangers inside our house, regardless of it still being cement walls and concrete floors, bothered me to an extent I didn't except. I saw red, I felt my goodwill was being abused. I cried of anger.\n\nLastly I agree, our guys are definitely gonna hear to stop with the whole buddy-buddy situation.", "After construction is done, get your house checked for meth. Something approaching 25% of houses sold in the US test positive for meth, and a significant source of contamination is contractors. They don\u2019t have to cook at your place, just using meth at your house is enough to cause levels of contamination that need to be remediated before the house is safe to live in.", "Telling people they are responsible is very different than having a contract in place. Your words might not hold legally if something happens in your home. Both teams are likely to point fingers at each other and at the end, the responsibility will likely end up falling on you.\n\nI would tell this other team no, they can not use your home, and then contact your team's manager and explain the threats of the other team and how you're being pressured and how uncomfortable it has made you. If he wants to keep you as a client, he should be talking to this other team on your behalf and get them to back off. If they want to help each other that's between them, but involving you in their arrangement is unprofessional.", "A relative has literally had a terrible contractor working on their home for over *two years* now. They've done all sorts of stupid stuff in the home, and at every step of the way my relative has made choices that have helped the contractor rather than protect themself. The contractor stops deserving the benefit of the doubt at a certain point. It seems like if you don't get an attitude with these people sometimes they'll walk all over you, and even if you watch them pretty closely they'll still find ways to take advantage.  \n\nWhen you're paying someone to do a job, they should be protecting your interests and not putting your property at risk. Best of luck as you negotiate the work with your team.", "He basically threatened you, seriously your construction should have nothing to do with him, his company input can only confuse your warranty.  If something fails and it was his guys who did that, it would still be up to your builder to carry out the warranty.  Ring him back and tell him you have rethought the issue given a little more time to think it over, and you\u2019re not happy at his implied threats, then give him 24 hours to return your key and remove all items from your house leaving it the way it was before their intrusion", "My team removed all their tools, all the materials. We might a bit of concrete stored at the back. \n\nI told Mr.A, Mr.A's team, my team, the responsible for my team, if anything goes missing, it's Mr.A responsibility. If it comes to it, I've met the owner of the property and have his contact. \n\nNot only Am I stupid, I'm stupid twice because I let Mr.A guilt trip into letting them use the place on 2 different occasions.", "Thank you for the concern. We are not in the US, the drug of choice here I think is heroin. I don't believe I've ever heard of a dismantled meth lab in the area.\n\nMy husband and I will be going there every day regardless and  put security cameras soon. If we have the slight suspicious about it, we'll call the police.", "Absolutely this is the way.\n\nAlso OP, if your house is vandalized, who will pay to replace the stolen items and the damage done to your house? You better believe that you could have legal problems over this.\n\nThey will also help themselves to your water, toilets and electricity. Personally, I'd have all utilities shut off until your contractor comes back.\n\nGet your contractor involved to protect you and the worksite.", "Well, everyone can be stupid sometimes.  As long as you learn from it, that\u2019s what counts!  Good luck!", "Ah.  Apologize for the US-centric assumption. I work in the housing industry here and people have NO IDEA how pervasive meth contamination is in this country.", "There's nothing to be stolen, the house is brick walls and concrete floors at this stage. \n\nThey have their own water supply, but we gave them permission you use our electricity while they wait for city hall to install theirs this week. \n\nWe only have one bathroom, which is locked and retrieved the keys.\n\nThe thing is, right now there's not a wall dividing the properties, which will be done on a later stage. That side of the house is being dug up to install new pipes.\n\nIf they didn't have access to our electricity, the construction would stop. And I don't want to be that petty, even though is not my problem.\n\nHowever, my contractor and the owner of the house will hear about it soon."]}
