Usually I leave around 8:30am and my sitter picks Sugar up around 10:30am. It was around 9am so I was already at the office. I text her back and told her that I could talk to my manager and see if I could leave work early to pick her up so she wouldn't have to watch Sugar all day. (My job allows me to WFH, but we do have to be in the office certain days.) She never responsed to that text. \n\nAround 2pm I text and called her to see if I needed to leave at 3pm to pick up Sugar early. No response. So I told her I was leaving at 3pm to pick up Sugar from her place. When I was ten minutes from her place I let her know I was close. That is when she text me and told me she had never picked up Sugar, and she assumed the text about me talking to my manager meant I was going to go home and look after Sugar. \n\nAt which point I text her WTF. She responded that it wasn't her choice to get sick. I told her that I knew that, but she should have told me she wasn't coming to pick up my dog at all so I could have left sooner. At the point, I told her that she could keep the money I gave her this month for watching Sugar (I pay her in advance plus tip), but I would be looking for a new dog watcher. \n\nShe then sent me a long paragraph that my dog should be fine for a few hours and that to her it wasn't worth $25 to watch Sugar while she's sick. \n\nWhich I agree with completely. However when I leave sugar for more than two hours I usually prep her (separate her so she doesn't eat the cat food, put down a puppy pad, etc). I would never ask my sister to put my dog above her health. But she didn't tell me she wasn't getting Sugar so I didn't know she was there by herself for that long. \n\nI talked to a friend about the situation. While they say it's fine I'm upset I'm being too rash in letting her go quickly. As for the sitter she has called me a selfish person. AITA?\n\nTL;DR: My dog sitter did not pick up my dog when she was sick. Because she didn't tell me and my dog was alone for hours, I let her go.", "created_utc": 1683673699, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13d99q6/aita_for_firing_my_sick_dog_sitter_for_not/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Although it would have been much clearer if she responded with an \"ok.\"\n\nYou basically had a communication malfunction with a person who is sick, so it's not surprising her thinking process would be fuzzy.  What's your excuse?", "Info: what was the exact message you sent about leaving early and working from home?", "I think YTA because you were pretty harsh on her given what seemed like a communication mishap, which both parties failed. \n\nHer reason was very valid. She misunderstood your text \u201cI could ask my manager, WFH and be with the dog\u201d (or whatever you texted). Even if you made it super clear, even if your text was \u201ccan you pick up sugar or do you want me to go home?\u201d, she would still get a pass because she had been throwing up since 6am. Her reading and comprehension was probably very hindered. \n\nThe question you need to ask yourself is: \u201cdid she intentionally leave Sugar home and intentionally didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d Did she have bad intent? People make mistakes at work all the time.", "INFO: Could you specify exactly what you said in the manager text? I think depending on how you phrased that, it'll decide my judgement.", "YTA for not updating the sitter about you talking to your manager about going home to work. She's sick, not flaking, so why would you fire her over your lack of communication?", "The message you sent was vague and I\u2019d have read it as you were going home to watch Sugar too. Especially if I was sick. She could\u2019ve responded and asked for clarification but she\u2019d already told you she was sick so it wasn\u2019t really necessary IMO. Obviously if you\u2019re not happy about it you are entitled to fire her but I\u2019m not really sure why you\u2019ve fired her over this tbh? It\u2019s not ideal that Sugar was alone for a few hours but if she\u2019s generally a reliable and good sitter then I think you overreacted. You could\u2019ve just asked her to be clearer next time she\u2019s sick. So I guess soft YTA.", "YTA.  Your dog sitter effectively \"called in sick\".  People do this when they are NOT coming to work.  The assumption on your part should have been that you were on your own and you should have acted accordingly.  If you called your boss and told him or her what the sitter told you, you would probably think boss was an asshole if he/she fired you for not coming in anyway.\n\nETA: saw after posting that sitter said she would pick up later than usual.  I still think that YTA for firing her because she misunderstood you to say you would WFH.  Sick people get a pass for not being at their best and should not be fired for it.", "YTA. Miscommunication. I initially read your text to her the same why she probably interpreted it as a \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll see if I can WFH today so you don\u2019t have to come out when you\u2019re sick.\u201d Also $25 for an all day dog sitter??? I hope that was $25/hr.", "YTA you sent her a vague text suggesting you would be working from home so she wouldn\u2019t have to watch Sugar. Seems to be cutting off your nose to spite your face to fire an otherwise good dog sitter over a miscommunication when she was legitimately sick. It\u2019s not like you would have wanted her puking all over your place.", "YTA I pictured her praying to the porcelain god all day, relieved that she didn't have to force herself out in that state as you were going to care for your dog yourself. Dog walkers are like gold dust. Finding that ideal combo of trustworthy with your pet AND a key to your home isn't easy. In a post COVID world where people got dogs then went back to work..you may have just made life quite difficult for yourself", "This really feels like more of an advice question. Is she generally reliable? How long had she been watching the dog before this? Are there any other concerns with her work? What message exactly did you send her, and how easy was it to misinterpret (was there an ambiguous \"her\" about the sitter vs the dog?)\n\nFundamentally, it seems like there was a miscommunication; a critical one, but just a miscommunication, followed by her sleeping off her illness. Is that sufficient to fire her on its own to you? Do you feel she is genuinely less responsible than a random new dog sitter? I wouldn't think so, the same way I wouldn't fire an employee for a single no call no show due to illness, but I don't know your history, so I can't answer those questions for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You knew full well that she was vomiting-level sick and there was then a miscommunication/misunderstanding. But even though the dog was fine, you (in actually normal mental & physical functioning on your part!) decided the sitter needed punishing for the mistake. Anyways, the deed is done now that she's laid off, and hopefully she can find a better human to work for.", "Are people crazy, NTA. Like if she had text to say I can't make it rather than I'll be late the whole thing would have been avoided. Then she didn't even answer your calls and messages. Maybe your title is wrong, it should be that you fired her for not letting you know she didn't pick up your dog.", "NTA, she had last said she was going to pick your dog up late, not that she wasn't going to show, and in general, you are not required to continue to use a service provider like this when you're no longer comfortable full stop, no reason required, but in any event failure to communicate like this is an acceptable reason to not continue and calling you selfish for expecting her to actually do what she expressly said she  was going to do - pick up the dog - and not fail to do it without telling you, is absurdly self-entitled.  \n\nIf she had wanted to call out, all she needed to do was tell you.  Instead she said she was coming and didn't and then took zero responsibility for failing to communicate this to you.  Fine to not continue to use someone who accepts no responsibility like this.", "YTA\u2026good luck finding someone else who can meet your ridiculous expectations.", "Do you think dog sitters don\u2019t talk to each other?

Though you could have communicated a bit better,  it's on the business that's charging you to communicate and show up. That person is unreliable. I care about my dogs like a person with a child.  Would that be acceptable for a child??", "You\u2019re such an ass\u2620\ufe0f you say you agree completely that someone shouldn\u2019t work while their sick and then continue to make excuses for your shitty behavior.

They are not trying to screw you over, they are physically ill.", "NTA. She told you she'd pick up Sugar later than usual. Instead, she (1) didn't pick up Sugar at all, and (2) didn't update you on that development, assuming some nonsense that was nothing like what you texted her. Then she got belligerent. If she'd let you know first thing in the morning she was sick and couldn't come -- different story. Yes, many people wouldn't fire her over this, but you do you. That doesn't make you an asshole.", "YTA\n\nfor firing my sick dog sitter. full stop. All that needs to be read.\n\nShould of got another sitter, let the sick person rest.

Yeah, and good luck keeping a decent dog walker/sitter going forward.  \n\n\nIf what you wrote was was the equivalent of \" I could talk to my manager and see if I could leave work early to pick her up so she wouldn't have to watch Sugar all day.\" That's a statement, not a question.

While you could have communicated more clearly, the sitter ALSO ought to have been able to confirm that they are not coming, given she was paid in advance.

If she's been a good sitter up until this incident, you shouldn't quickly dismiss her.", "YTA 100%", "NTA it sounds like she was trying to pull one over on you - be that getting paid when she never picked up your dog or not properly calling off.

I could say e s h bc you didn\u2019t keep texting, but you were working so I get it. She should have outright said I\u2019m not getting your dog today. I get she was sick and possibly sleeping, but it\u2019s unprofessional and I get letting her go. I probably wouldn\u2019t have gone so far if it was her first offense and she\u2019s worked with you for awhile.", "INFO: And how did Sugar respond to being alone all day? Check with your neighbors - did she bark/whine/howl? Tear up the house? Or was she fine with it and just wanted a needed walk when you got home? Some dogs are great being alone with their toys and bed and some aren't. I would think that is the important thing.", "She is sick , she may have pass out. She phoned you she was sick. You were given notation. Sorry she have the nerve to get sick. You are and AH. If she picked up the dog and you got sick you would have been mad also.", "She could have just texted back please do. I feel so sick. I honestly can\u2019t pick up sugar even though I said I would just be late doing so. She just didn\u2019t respond at all. The text about asking the manager was vague enough. I could, not I will. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a miscommunication. It was a complete LACK of communication after the initial one from the dog sitter. Op was working and still tried to communicate with the dog sitter and got no response. She was still at work working. \n\nShe should have said from the start I can\u2019t pick up your dog today instead of I\u2019ll be late. Sure she could have thought she\u2019d be better, but setting alarms exist even when sick when your brain is fuzzy.\n\nIf I had an employee that said they would be late and just never showed and stopped responding to messages, it would be a serious problem. If they told me right off they couldn\u2019t come in, I could try and replace them or cover at least part of their shift. I kinda feel like it\u2019s almost worse than a no call no show (different with pet sitters I imagine). I\u2019m there and know when someone doesn\u2019t show up. If I can\u2019t get them on the phone I can just call others to replace. If I had someone say they are coming and just stop answering my calls and never showed... I\u2019d be very annoyed bc it would rob me of getting a replacement in enough time if at all. I wouldn\u2019t fire them, but give them a mark on their record. \n\nTbf though if someone called/texted and said they were vomiting I would be like just stay home. I\u2019ll find someone else or work around. The I\u2019ll just be late kinda makes me think it was a hangover and she passed right back out until afternoon. Even if it was a hangover, Idgaf the dog sitter really messed up imho. It was seriously unprofessional.", "This. What I read from this was OP saying, basically, \"No problem, I'll take care of my dog today.\" I was shocked that OP offered to care for their pet, then, just didn't do it and is blaming the sitter.
