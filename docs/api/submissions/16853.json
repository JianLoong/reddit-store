Usually I leave around 8:30am and my sitter picks Sugar up around 10:30am. It was around 9am so I was already at the office. I text her back and told her that I could talk to my manager and see if I could leave work early to pick her up so she wouldn't have to watch Sugar all day. (My job allows me to WFH, but we do have to be in the office certain days.) She never responsed to that text. \n\nAround 2pm I text and called her to see if I needed to leave at 3pm to pick up Sugar early. No response. So I told her I was leaving at 3pm to pick up Sugar from her place. When I was ten minutes from her place I let her know I was close. That is when she text me and told me she had never picked up Sugar, and she assumed the text about me talking to my manager meant I was going to go home and look after Sugar. \n\nAt which point I text her WTF. She responded that it wasn't her choice to get sick. I told her that I knew that, but she should have told me she wasn't coming to pick up my dog at all so I could have left sooner. At the point, I told her that she could keep the money I gave her this month for watching Sugar (I pay her in advance plus tip), but I would be looking for a new dog watcher. \n\nShe then sent me a long paragraph that my dog should be fine for a few hours and that to her it wasn't worth $25 to watch Sugar while she's sick. \n\nWhich I agree with completely. However when I leave sugar for more than two hours I usually prep her (separate her so she doesn't eat the cat food, put down a puppy pad, etc). I would never ask my sister to put my dog above her health. But she didn't tell me she wasn't getting Sugar so I didn't know she was there by herself for that long. \n\nI talked to a friend about the situation. While they say it's fine I'm upset I'm being too rash in letting her go quickly. As for the sitter she has called me a selfish person.

In a post COVID world where people got dogs then went back to work..you may have just made life quite difficult for yourself", "This really feels like more of an advice question.

Is that sufficient to fire her on its own to you? Do you feel she is genuinely less responsible than a random new dog sitter?

Check with your neighbors - did she bark/whine/howl? Tear up the house? Or was she fine with it and just wanted a needed walk when you got home?

I feel so sick. I honestly can\u2019t pick up sugar even though I said I would just be late doing so. She just didn\u2019t respond at all. The text about asking the manager was vague enough. I could, not I will. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t a miscommunication. It was a complete LACK of communication after the initial one from the dog sitter.

Sure she could have thought she\u2019d be better, but setting alarms exist even when sick when your brain is fuzzy.\n\nIf I had an employee that said they would be late and just never showed and stopped responding to messages, it would be a serious problem. If they told me right off they couldn\u2019t come in, I could try and replace them or cover at least part of their shift. I kinda feel like it\u2019s almost worse than a no call no show (different with pet sitters I imagine). I\u2019m there and know when someone doesn\u2019t show up. If I can\u2019t get them on the phone I can just call others to replace. If I had someone say they are coming and just stop answering my calls and never showed... I\u2019d be very annoyed bc it would rob me of getting a replacement in enough time if at all. I wouldn\u2019t fire them, but give them a mark on their record. \n\nTbf though if someone called/texted and said they were vomiting I would be like just stay home. I\u2019ll find someone else or work around. The I\u2019ll just be late kinda makes me think it was a hangover and she passed right back out until afternoon. Even if it was a hangover, Idgaf the dog sitter really messed up imho. It was seriously unprofessional.", "This. What I read from this was OP saying, basically, \"No problem, I'll take care of my dog today.\" I was shocked that OP offered to care for their pet, then, just didn't do it and is blaming the sitter.

Child, pet, elderly, etc care is not a job where you can be aloof in my mind. You did what you felt was best for the care of your dog.\n\nIf this was another line of work 100% I\u2019d agree with the Y T A votes. But I can see a reason for an exception in this situation.

Were they approved to leave early to WFH, and if so, what time?  I would want to check back in an update, as well as make sure the sitter made it my place to watch the dog.\n\nIt sounds as there was a breakdown in communications on both ends, one because that party was ill and the other because they were working.", "But OP said it was fine and they'd try to leave work early. Completely understandable the sitter took that as \"Don't worry about it today\". And then they didn't bother trying to contact the sitter again until 5 hours later.\n\nDon't know about you but the times I've been sick, any moment that wasn't spent puking was spent sleeping.", "I'm really not sure how you reached that conclusion honestly. Sitter didn't let OP know until he was already at work, and stated that they would be late. He then replied with: \n\n>I text her back and told her that I could talk to my manager and see if I could leave work early to pick her up so she wouldn't have to watch Sugar all day.\n\nWhich, to me, says that he thought she was going to watch the dog and he would see if he could get out early. Otherwise he wouldn't have specified \"so she wouldn't have to watch Sugar all day\", he would've just said so she didn't have to watch Sugar. \n\nSo she has left him under the impression that she was just going to be late. And every attempt at communicating with her she ignored. I don't see how you can blame OP for the lack of communication when the only person not communicating at all was the sitter.", "All she had to do was say, \"Sick can't make it,\" and the whole thing would have been avoided.

If the way op said he texted her, as in he asked her if he wanted him to come back home earlier so she doesn't have to work all day, just makes it very clear that he'll come back from work to relieve her of work if that's what she wants, all she had to do was text back an ok. Not that he's rushing back at this minute...", "Op didn\u2019t say it was fine. They said they could ask to leave early. Could is a signal of do I need to ask? At least for me. It\u2019s not even a sure fire of getting a yes. The boss could have said no and what then. She should have just said I can\u2019t be there from the start. It\u2019s as simple as that.

She had a reasonable expectation she would be.", "I think I'm more confused that if they never texted me back, I'd text them again to see if they can confirm reading my msg. Or even give them a call. If they still fail to respond or pick up the phone, I'd go to my manager and ask if I can swing home super quick to check up on the dog.\n\nOP needs to work a bit more on his communication skills.

Punctual and polite?

It then tilted into Y T A, but could absolutely be N T A if this sitters history is already spotty.  \n\nAlso sis you are underpaying.  You can't really have absolute control over your dog sitters health for a pathetic $25, not when dog daycare in a GROUP setting is $45.  Individual care with one handler is EXPENSIVE.

When someone tells you they've been throwing up for the past 3 hours the appropriate response is \"stay home and rest.\" There's really not a ton of exceptions to that. \n\nShould they have communicated better? Sure. But that doesn't change the fact that you shouldn't expect someone to work or do basically anything if they're that sick. Not even just from the, idk, basic human decency standpoint. But if that's not enough, from a practical standpoint someone who's that sick isn't likely to be able to provide a level of care much better than the dog being alone a few extra hours and if the limited care they'd likely be providing your pet isn't enough reason there's also you exposing yourself to whatever they may have (norovirus is extremely contageous.) \n\nSo yeah the miscommunication is a moot point when you should have just told her not to come in the first place. You were the AH even before you had the audacity to fire her, that just really solidifies it even more.", "Your sitter called in sick.  She could not work and she informed you of that.  So you fired her. YTA - very much.", "NTA.\n\nIdk what you guys are smoking, someone saying that they will be late and then not showing up without communication is unacceptable.", "I'm a dog sitter, I own my own business. NTA.\n\nThis is not some office job where miscommunications can be fixed all willy nilly. If I'm not there to take a dog out, things can go very very bad. Ruined carpet, anxiety induced chewing, bladder infections from holding urine, etc. \n\nNot to mention there are MANY emotions involved in dog sitting that aren't in office work/other lines of work. You are essentially sitting someone's baby. It is a REQUIREMENT that you have good communication skills so the parent isn't anxious about their baby. \n\nWhat you said, if you said it like that, would have been clear to me as simply a suggestion needing an answer. Unless you are in a coma or the hospital, you NEED to be clear and communicative as a sitter. \n\nThis sitter will hopefully learn a lesson that clear communication is a must no matter the circumstances. It's a tough lesson, but it doesn't sound like she wanted to learn it without a consequence.\n\nThat being said, you're probably not gonna find a sitter that cheap who is also good, lol I charge$60 a day.", "\"I text her back and told her that I could talk to my manager and see if I could leave work early to pick her up so she wouldn't have to watch Sugar *all day*.\"\n\nHey look. It's the language that implies that the sitter would still need to show up like she said she would.", "YTA", "NTA - What was the Op supposed to do, set up a satellite signal to ask the dog sitter if she bothered turning up?\n\nAs an employee, it is *your* responsibility to inform your employer if you cannot attend your job one day. Not *maybe* not, Not *possibly* not, only a yes or a no. It is irresponsible to deliberately give unclear info and then suspend all communication.\n\nIt\u2019s irresponsible.\n\nAnd the fact that she managed to finally magically message back only when Op was on their way to her house? Nah, that\u2019s suspicious and deliberate. She just didn\u2019t want to have to admit that she couldn\u2019t dog sit.", "Nta disagree with the most. Your sitter said she was sick but would pick up your dog later than normal.\n\nYou answered you would try to get to her earlier to get your dog from her so she has more time to recover in peace at no point did she communicate she wasn't going and leaving your dog inside without even calling you or answering your text imo  is reason enough to fire her.", "Anyone else really confused why a dog can\u2019t be left alone for a few hours?? What is it gonna stick a fork in a socket?? YTA cause the whole thing is ridiculous", "He/she did leave work early, though. It\u2019s not like they assumed she\u2019s not picking up so they don\u2019t have to leave early.", "Idk how people are miss interpreting what OP said.\n\nOP said that she can pickup the dog early so she would not have to wait all day. OP would not need to pick up the dog if the sitter was not going to show up.\n\nAnd then later we see the sitter said that the $25 was not worth it to the sitter to do her job, which implies that she decided to not show up.\n\nIts not great communication, but it really isn't that bad.", "The text was much less ambiguous than what you're quoting. If you're right about something, you shouldn't feel the need to modify things like this.", "OP said she could try to leave early to pick up the dog from the sitter so she wouldn\u2019t have to watch her all day. That very clearly communicates that OP expected the sitter to pick up the dog like she said she would. She didn\u2019t say \u201cMaybe I can leave work early and you won\u2019t have to pick her up at all.\u201d She said essentially, \u201cMaybe you only have to watch her for part of the day.\u201d", "Also this. At the end of the day, it was a miss communication.  And OP *fired* the sitter because she might have messed up whilst she was ill. THAT'S some pretty AH standards", "OP said she could try to leave early to pick up the dog from the sitter so she wouldn\u2019t have to watch her all day. That very clearly communicates that OP expected the sitter to pick up the dog like she said she would.", "Most commenters didn't really understand what they read since most of them go off assumptions that don't fit what's written. I am completly with you. You can't say you come later, then get offered to get released early, then without a word never show up, stop responding and getting mad at the employer for being angry at that. If they texted, even later, apologizing profusely, that they passed out, they underestimated how sick they were, okay, I get that, but the doubling down?! No way! \n\nAlso, if you are throwing up since 6 am but text when the owner is already at work, you already fucked up. Text before they leave.", "No it's not.  Dog daycare is $45...the sitter is getting robbed at the rate of $25.", "OP said she could try to leave early to pick up the dog from the sitter so she wouldn\u2019t have to watch her all day. That very clearly communicates that OP expected the sitter to pick up the dog like she said she would.", "She wasn't off work. She said she'd come later, got offered to be released early. That is not off work. And even if that is what happend, you apologize for misreading the situation, explain that you fell asleep and don't double down. If you \"that\" sick, you make it clear, you don't say, I'll come later after OP is already at work. Gee, I get shitty employers and all, but we as employees have some responsibilities as well. Communicating our situation clearly is one of them.", "That's highly dependent on where they are.\n\n\nAnd giving her pay for work she will never do is generous, giving that what she did is definitely sufficient cause to fire someone on the spot.", "The dog sitter didn\u2019t respond even once after the first one so really just a lack of communication from the dog sitter. Not both ends. The breakdown of communication was on the dog sitter not responding at all. I\u2019m sorry being sick isn\u2019t the same as being at a job. \n\nEven if op had gotten permission to wfh she wouldn\u2019t have known where to go bc the dog sitter didn\u2019t say they didn\u2019t get the dog. They didn\u2019t say anything. That\u2019s unprofessional af", "I think this is really the point. OPs first text was ambiguous, and when you're dehydrated and ill you're not thinking correctly. I think OP should have concluded after silence that the sitter was out of action, and would need to look after Sugar themselves.", "She didn\u2019t say that. OP said she could try to leave early to pick up the dog from the sitter so she wouldn\u2019t have to watch her all day. That very clearly communicates that OP expected the sitter to pick up the dog like she said she would. How else would she be able to pick up the dog early from the sitter\u2019s?", "The fact that even in the comment section people are interpreting the text differently, shows there was some room for confusion. The sick sitter was obviously not at her sharpest if she was that sick. Firing the sitter was probably an overreaction.", "I think a lot of people feel quite guilty about taking sick leave. Given she was throwing up since 6am OP probably should have read between the lines and cancelled there and then", "What does \u201cearly\u201d mean? Now? Later? What does \u201cnot have to watch Sugar all day\u201d mean? Not at all? Just not the *whole* day but part of it?\n\nIf I was out of my mind puking I could easily misinterpret that as \u201cI\u2019ll talk to my boss about doing this myself; don\u2019t worry about it today\u201d or I could interpret it as \u201cI\u2019ll try to reduce your workload, but please pick the dog up when you can\u201d\u2026 and as the dog owner it\u2019s my responsibility to make sure things are covered. They knew the sitter was sick and there was a reasonable chance for miscommunication and yet waited 5 hours to confirm???", "But she didn't specify where she's picking the dog up. It could easily be read that she was going to leave early to pick the dog up from home and take it out for a walk so the sitter didn't have to. That's how I would have taken it. Though OP is just paraphrasing anyway, without seeing the exact text chain it's hard to say who's most at fault for the misunderstanding. \n\nEither way, OP overreacted for a communication error on both sides.", "Oh I completely get where you're coming from and do agree OP could have done more. I also think firing was an overreaction. However, I don't think what he said was as ambiguous as people / the sitter are making out. And at the end of the day, the sitter never actually called off sick, only said they would be late. All the communication from that point on was on the basis that the sitter would be arriving, just later than their normal time. \n\nFor me this is ESH, and this shouldve been solved with a discussion about how sickness would be handled in the future and the need to make things clear. \n\nAlso, just a random thing here, but looking back over the post, OP never actually confirmed their gender and I just assumed they were male. I'd be quite interested in the psychology behind that. Just something I thought of while writing this reply lol", "Should they, though?! Throwing up doesn't have to mean much. Morning sickness, eaten something bad and when it's out of the system it's over, I throw up for hours sometimes when my body is in turmoil and am completly fine after 2-3 hours, it can also be an euphomism for a bad hangover.\n\nThere are many reasons to throw up but being able to go to work some hours late so what should they read between the lines? They can't read minds and making assumptions can do more bad than good sometimes", "The time delay could be because they were working. It\u2019s not completely unreasonable to get bogged down with work when you\u2019re, you know, working. We don\u2019t know how quickly the sitter normally responds to texts, so maybe the lack of response when OP suggested they could ask their boss about WFH. We also don\u2019t know if OP texted the sitter about WFH right after the sitter\u2019s text. If they did, it\u2019s a bit unreasonable to think the was passed out asleep from being sick.\n\nNTA (dog sitter): If the sitter was unable to pickup/care for the dog, they should have said that instead of just saying they were running behind. OP should have called the sitter to work out what the situation was and to verify if the sitter had already picked the dog up (which could be a reasonable assumption). \n\nOP is a soft-AH for firing the sitter after a miscommunication on both sides.", "If you were out of your mind puking and managed to text your employer wouldn\u2019t you say I cannot function today. Cannot work. Not I\u2019m gonna be late. None of the rest matters. She said she would pick up the dog and did not. She could have said at ANY point she was too sick to pick up the dog and did not. This wasn\u2019t miscommunication. It was entirely lack of communication from the sick one. You could interpret things but that was not what was said at all. \n\nIt\u2019s a dog owners responsibility, but when paying someone to take on that responsibility when the owner is working it\u2019s kinda bullshit when the person being paid says meh I\u2019m not gonna show and let them look like shit. I\u2019m sick but didn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t show.  All the dog sitter has to do was say I won\u2019t be there. They didn\u2019t. Like I said I wouldn\u2019t have fired them but after this I definitely would.", "Assuming the paraphrasing is accurate, she said \u201cpick her up\u201d so the sitter \u201cwouldn\u2019t have to watch her all day.\u201d This clearly communicates that she expected the sitter to pick up the dog and watch her for part of the day at least. Never mind the fact that the sitter said she would.\n\nThe fact is, the sitter didn\u2019t do what she said she would and then didn\u2019t respond all day despite the fact that OP didn\u2019t indicate that the dog wouldn\u2019t have to be watched at all. There\u2019s certainly room for some grace on OP\u2019s part given that the sitter was sick (unless it was a hangover or something), but I don\u2019t think OP is necessarily an AH for not giving it.", "Lol I assumed OP was female and went back to check when I read your comment.", "I think it really depends where you live. To me (Australian)  \"all day\" doesn't mean anything. It's just a way of speaking. \"Don't have to watch her all day\" would be completely interchangeable with \"don't have to watch her at all\".", "Interesting. Even with the other context clue of \u201cpicking her up\u201d? And the fact that that\u2019s what the sitter said she\u2019d do? It makes no sense for OP to say they\u2019re picking the dog up from their own home. The sitter said she would do something then ghosted and never communicated anything different. Even if the sitter interpreted OP\u2019s text the way you describe, she didn\u2019t know OP was for sure going to be able to leave work early to watch the dog and she read but didn\u2019t respond to what was a question, not a statement."]}
