Your friend is an asshole for throwing slurs at you, what's her problem?\n\nI completely understand why a young girl would want to date a pretty anime boy (they can be bi, too). I think her disgust with women kissing is that she doesn't find it as attractive as men kissing, not that she thinks it's unnatural. Men tend to have the reverse double standard.", "NTA. You are entirely correct. Hopefully she'll grow out of it. You didn't mention your own sexuality but if you're mlm and it's making you uncomfortable, try and tell her maybe. On the other hand, you may get nowhere and it won't be worth the hassle.", "NTA. Lesbian is considered a porn word by algorithms because of the inverse happening.", "You're NTA and she's homophobic as hell. Sure it's not her fault if she thinks two girls kissing is gross. But it is her problem, and she needs to get over it. The double standards are insane.", "NTA but its a bit more complicated then that\nAt 14 you two are way to young to be really fully develop your attraction and love types\n\nThose books are marketed towards fem audience in most situations but Id wager she'd enjoy a book like death note just as much\n\nIt may not be the BL specifically that she likes but maybe the way the boys are writen / drawn in those types of books\n\nConsider also she could still like the character that was bisexual if kissing boys is the only criteria for her attraction", "Omg, dude, you both are only 14. She doesn't fetishize anything, she's discovering her sexuality and didn't get further than \"I like boys\", so naturally she likes content which pictures boys. She's also most likely confused with her body changing, and doesn't want to think about female bodies in anything close to erotical situation. Leave her be. Mild YTA, because you're probably similarly confused. \n\nAlso, there is nothing wrong with fetishes. It's only wrong when it leads to objectification of a real person. Even if you fetishize a character, it gives you some nice fantasies, and doesn't harm anyone or affect anything. What point you was hoping to made by interfering with her erotical fantasies?", "ESH.  She shouldn't throw slurs around and owes you a serious apology.  As for you, leave her alone to read what she likes.  \n\nAlso consider that she may not be quite as straight cisgender as you think.", "YTA. Why would you have to love every type of gay content just because you like to see men together? Do men and women have the same anatomy and same kind of relationship while in love? I love BL because I like the idea of men discovering how it feels to be loved by another man, but I'm a woman and I'm not interested in watching women together, because as a woman I can imagine how it would work for me... and I have a pair of boobs, thank you. I know how they look. I don't need to see 4 of them.MxM is a totally new territory to discover for me.\n\nBut then BL is *fiction.*And mostly drawn for women by women.It has nothing to do with real gay male relationships and knows no limits when it comes with the scenario and the characters. I love to see various ideas of what a relation would be with fantasy characters, in unrealistic settings, and I love to see an author develop something really new or daring. Ever heard of Alphas or Omegas?What does even 'sexualizing gay males' mean when it come with BL?? It doesn't focus on real persons or realistic relationships. It isn't comparable to IRL gay relationships, at all.\n\nIt's all a fantasy.But I'm not surprised, I've had people call me gay for liking BL. As if liking to see two men together meant I have to fall in love with a woman. See the logic?\n\nAlso BL, slash, yaoi... it's all erotica. And you *recommended* GL to your friend? Aren't you then 'fetishizing' GL??  If your only problem with 'sexualizing' people appears when it's two **men**, you're basically... insecure, projecting and lashing out.", "[deleted]", "It's kinda complicated though, as you both are 14 and too young to actually develop your types when it comes to attractions and love itself. On the other hand, fetishing gay men, while considering being lesbian \"unnatural\" is not okay.  \nIn my opinion, OP, you're NTA. Your friend really sucks, maybe it's time to stop hanging out with her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She\u2019s also incredibly homophobic, it\u2019s got nothing to do with her figuring things out, 14 is old enough to not being a homephobic asshole and not fetishise people, which is always a bad thing, because it dehumanises them.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with having a fetish, but a fetish is a thing you do, not a thing people are.\n\nNTA OP, your friend sucks and you should probably stop hanging out with her.", "I actually agree with this more, thank you.", "This is, hands down, one of the most rounded, well adjusted, comments I have ever seen on a thread like this.", "No, she really couldn\u2019t, not with that homophobic fetishising attitude.", "Being disgusted by two girls kissing is a textbook example of homophobia. Shut up.", "it\u2019s really not tho\u2026you don\u2019t have to be homophobic to not want to see or think something is gross it\u2019s only homophobic if you show a dislike or prejudice to them specifically but no that\u2019s not being homophobic", "OPs friend has no problem with straight people kissing, she gets her own personal gratification from two men kissing, she specifically has a problem with women kissing because it\u2019s two women. That is explicitly homophobia.\n\nThere is literally no possible way what she does or says could be interpreted as not homophobic by anyone arguing in good faith, and the fact that she called her friend a homophobic slur when he called her out on her shitty homophobia makes it incredibly fucking weird for you to come here and try to pretend the person being explicitly homophobic wasn\u2019t being explicitly homophobic.\n\nIf I said it was gross to see a black person kiss a white person but really got off on a white person kissing an Asian person, and then called someone the n word for calling me out on my transparent bigotry and hypocrisy would also you be here claiming I\u2019m not actually a racist? Cause those two situations are barely any different."]}
