My niece has sensory issues with food and only brings safe food. Most of the time it's cereal and she's never had push back. If that is the case like your state, they still can't force her to comply. They just want her to and imo are pushing way to hard.", "This is for the lunches they serve, not the ones the kids bring from home.", "We\u2019re still pretty new, but I haven\u2019t run across anything else this nuts. \n\nThey\u2019re actually pretty good about most other things, we chose to move here partially for the school district.", "That was my initial instinct as well, that it was a push to get more people buying school lunch. \n\nThey\u2019re required to offer it but almost everyone packs from home (it\u2019s cheaper!) so I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re offering it at a loss. \n\nDefinitely wasn\u2019t an agency thing. I can\u2019t imagine with all the problems in the world an agency took issue with my kid eating chicken and celery for lunch, haha.", "Good for you!", "We had a crazy parent that watched us during lunch and she\u2019d lose her mind and withhold recess if anyone threw out any part of their lunch.", "I really hope other states are more logical with how funds are given out.  Just a totally circus that doesnt help anyone :(", "totally know that and totally part of the program in my area.  ALL kids much have lunches that meet the same rules the school lunches do. MY area, yours is different. My is a monkey circus with most of the crap they expect.", "Pretty sure you\u2019re not in the US, then, and therefore not really relevant to the OP"]}
