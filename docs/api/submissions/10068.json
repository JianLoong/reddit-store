I see there only being 2 real reasons why they would push this neither is great though. 1.) Don't want to make kids jealous over food brought by peers. Or 2.) Schools have started to micromanage every aspect of kids' lives so they become good little automatons.\n\nThe only reason number one is bad is that I think a small amount of you don't get everything you want is good at younger ages, especially if no one is going hungry like in this situation. I believe being told you can't have that because it isn't yours at a young age could stomp out some of the entitlement we see sweeping the world.", "My daughter went to a private school who had to follow similar guidelines, however all we had to do was write them a letter asking them not to check the quality of her lunch and we could send whatever we wanted.  Maybe ask if that\u2019s an option?", "NTA what if a kid has celiac or lactose intolerance? How do they expect to enforce this? It's really weird.", "NTA So they want you to base your child's lunch on nutritional guidelines that have been made by lobbyists from the industries who are only interested in profit and couldn't care less about children's health? Her lunch sounds absolutely fine, not every meal has to have grains and milk is not that good for you she would be much better off just drinking water.", "Nta. They probably just had a couple kids jealous she's getting edible food.", "NTA \nquestion, are you in a \u201cbig\u201d city? I\u2019ve worked in education settings for years and have NEVER heard of something like this, but I have also always worked in larger cities where this would become a political issue.  I\u2019m honestly baffled.", "print out some info about the rates of lactose intolerance and give that to the faculty. NTA", "NTA \n\nThe food guide isn't supposed to be for every single meal.   Ffs.   You'd think educators would understand that.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYou packed a lunch your child would eat because you know them best.The teachers have it hard already is an overplayed card that doesn't trump logic in this scenario, and teachers have nothing to do  with these rules. We just have to enforce them, and most of things we enforce are stupid anyways. \n\n Also are they flagging down parents with kids with food allergies about their  lunchbox too? Is the school even providing well balance meals for all children? Because when I was a teacher all the options were basically diary and grains. Multiple students on the school lunch program were being fed food they were allergic to and alternatives were not available for these students. \n\nLike they consider ketchup as a vegetable....\n\nAlso, as ex-teacher and historian hobbyist, we all know the food pyramid/plate is a partial scam funded by food companies and the government.", "NTA.", "Nta, this is why teachers get so much shit from people. What you pack for your child's lunch is literally none of their business. Maybe if it was consistently sweets or something they could speak up but this is ridiculous. Teachers are supposed to teach the curriculum, that's it.", "NTA, and you shouldn't feel sorry for the teachers (government employees) if they have nothing better to do than harass you over this.", "One of my students comes with cordial everyday and it annoys the other teachers but honestly it\u2019s her kid and if she wants her to have cordial it\u2019s not really my business. NTA", "Their actions are likely not legal either if it's a public school. Parents have a fundamental right to choose how their children are raised, which likely includes what they're fed. If they continue to harass you, you can tell them you will talk to an attorney if it continues.", "YTA this policy exists to ensure kids don't become malnourished. Was there any carbohydrates (rice, pasta, potatoes) with the chicken? I'm less concerned about the dairy as your daughter can get that from other meals.", "Yes", "perfect meal, add toast or crackers I guess", "Seems like a huge waste of teachers time and energy to run after \"does not comply\" with appropriate school lunches", "Seriously i could understand if it was the 5th day in a row that she showed up with 7-11 pizza and a fizz pop but like cmon.\n\nWhen he said he couldn\u2019t remember what he sent her with I was a little concerned but after him detailing the mail\u2026the kids fine. \n\nI\u2019d hate to be a my parents in this day age. I\u2019ve always been a no breakfast maybe a snack for lunch type of kid. And I\u2019m still that way was an adult. I like dinner. I run 5 miles a day. \n\nI also remember that at one point my mom tried SO hard to send me to school with healthy lunches. I traded my pomegranate with a girl who had a little more weight then me for her ice cream that her mom always packed. Like we did that the entire week. Everybody won. That girl LOVED pomegranate, shed literally never had it before. And I liked the ice cream. \ud83e\uddd0\n\nMaybe they police it that badly now but when I was a kid or didn\u2019t matter what our parents packed because we traded and bartered it all lol", "Where did the school dictate anything?", "There are sometimes situations where teachers or childcare staff have to dictate to parents what their kids can and cannot have packed in their lunch. \n\nFor example, I had some students who were highly anaphylactic to nuts, so we just had a no nut policy. We provided alternative ideas for lunches and safe product swaps that were relatively similar prices. I\u2019ve had parents claim I was infringing on their kid\u2019s rights by not allowing a PB&J. I had a dad totally lose it on me and called a snowflake for reminding him his kid couldn\u2019t bring nuts. He purposely packed only nut products that day after we had reminded him the day before.\n\nI\u2019ve also had to sit parents down and explain lunches made only out of candy is not suitable and their kid needed actual food. One kid would come in with just a sleeve of saltines and half a package of pepperoni slices when it was dad\u2019s custody time. That was supposed to sustain the kid for twelve hours. Some parents are wild with what they consider appropriate lunches.\n\nOP on the other hand, their lunches seem fine and I wouldn\u2019t consider it a situation where the school needs to intervene.", "I was a mayo, pickles and mustard sandwiches kid. No lunch meat at all. My mom would sneak it in bc she didn't want the school to know how poor we were and think she couldn't afford lunch meat. I usually threw it out. \n\nIt was cycles of different foods my whole childhood.. ravioli, spaghetti os, very specific types of sandwich, very specific condiments and food combos and no deviation...\n\nTurns out I'm autistic. Shoulda seen that coming.", "Too much sugar in a\u2026 cheese? \n\nThere is more sugar in sandwich bread, haha.", "My friends kids had cereal for dinner last night. They get plenty of nutrition through the day with the different snacks & other meals they get. And cereal for DINNER?! WILD! HILARIOUS! Always makes their night when it's cereal night, because they think it's the silliest thing ever at their age.", "Oh give me a break.   You're an absolute idiot if you think the teachers are setting school policy. \n\nUnfortunately teachers do have it hard, and it's only getting worse.", "If you know where the article is I\u2019d love to check it out", "Totally agree. I had school lunch growing up and it was always lots of bread, bread, and more bread, with some meat dabbed on somewhere. And maybe a bag of chips on an especially opulent day. \n\nSo these aren\u2019t the folks who should be setting the standard, haha.", "Haha, husband sounds like a keeper.", "Right? Seemed like a weird thing to nitpick. If good parenting is measured by if your child eats a lot of carbs, I\u2019m parent of the year.", "The vagueness of it was certainly a point of aggravation for me as well. Totally agree with your description here.", "That\u2019s what I thought then I worried I was just being paranoid, making a problem where there isn\u2019t one. This has been affirming for sure.", "7-8.", "Pretty medium sized city. I\u2019d call it a town.", "Right?! I've definitely thrown a can of baked beans and some raw broccoli in a Tupperware and called it lunch as I was running out the door (the broccoli cooks in the microwave while heating the beans). Or just thrown some instant noodles and a thermos in my bag to add water from the kettle at break time.", "My mom when we were in elementary school would send us with lunch angles fairly frequently and one teacher started throwing them out and giving my mom shit for it. My mom lost it on the woman and the school. My mom was a shitty parent in a lot of ways but that lady was so far out of line. Like sure, starve my kids instead of letting them have mini pizzas for lunch.", "Like a Comanche Chief?", "I wish your daughter success in therapy. I agree the school should be happy the kids are sent to school with food, many can't afford that or a paid lunch. To build on the previous point at least the child is eating, much more likely to eat food they enjoy..yes even cold pizza!", "Unless they are willing to freely provide an alternate meal, then they either steal the children's food or make them eat nothing and send them home with their lunches (which they will eat once out of sight). It's a stupid system, and wastes teacher's time. Their job is not to police the kids lunches, unless they are eating edibles and swigging alcohol.", "I still remember sobbing to my mom that I got in trouble for having candy in my lunchbox. My mom was pissed, she didn\u2019t pack me candy. The lunch aide decided marshmallows were candy. She took away my little baggie of marshmallows and scolded me in front of my whole class. I was 5. This was 25 years ago. \n\nAre marshmallows healthy? Not particularly but the aide handed it in such an awful way it\u2019s stuck with me forever.", "Wow! While part of me wants to believe they are trying to get the kids to eat healthy, I saw some of your other replies and it really sounds like a money grab. \nAnd while I get why you wouldn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat parent\u201d and make this an issue, I want to thank you for trusting your daughter to make her own choices regarding food. I had many pictures of \u201cproperly\u201d proportioned plates shoved in my face and it played a part in a life long struggle with food. IMO, you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "I was a weird kid and would eat Mayo, pickle and mustard sandwiches. My mom would sneak bologna into them (the cheapest lunch meat she could manage to afford) because she was worried the teachers would think she didn't have enough money to give us lunch meat, & call CPS or something. \n\nFood insecurity is wild... and kids eat weird shit. xD", "She said it was Jack's Pizza.  That's either a delivery Jacks or the frozen Jack's Pizza from the grocery.", "Honestly I don't think they even looked. If they did, I never heard about it. \n\nReally, it was a pretty laissez faire school.", "What is a charter school? Is that a different thing than a public school?", "Tell them that your daughter's food necessities are determined between you and her doctor, it is none of their business.", "Or Jack is the child.", "It\u2019s a school that gets public funding but is operated by a private group. Often a for-profit corporation or a nonprofit organization. Sometimes they\u2019re operated by universities.", "Also, I am iffy on eating any dairy that's been in a semi-cool lunchbox for a few hours. \n\nIf the school requires that students eat a certain way, then they need to provide it without cost. That's my opinion on the matter, anyway.", "Eh just chuck a bag of cheesy corn chips in the lunch bag and dare them to say something \n\n(Before anyone asks, yes I'm joking. But also I found out the hard way that cheese flavouring actually DOES have dairy in it, at least here)", "Vitamin D and calcium is easily sourced by sufficient dark leafy greens. Looking for kid friendly recipies. Thx.", "In that case, I have a follow-up question.\n\nWhat's the difference between it an a private school. Because you've just described how \"private\" schools operate here in Australia.\n\nDo US private schools get *no* government funding?!", "I can't eat yogurt that's been out of the fridge more then 30secs and milk is a vile liquid (no allergy but I gag on it).. if it's calcium almonds are full of it too.. whether lactose intolerant or just hate the crap no one should be force fed.\n\nOP NTA", "In my time, they frozen the yogurt and that was the 'cold pack' for the lunchbox, with the thought that it would defrost by lunchtime. Took the teachers and parents a bit to figure out that I only threw up on days I actually ate the yogurt. Dairy can't be trusted to the mostly improper food handling that is a lunchbox.\n\n\nI can eat yogurt now, but only directly from the fridge. 5-10 minutes out, and it goes in the trash.", "Though my teachers learned early that if I was drinking milk, it was because I wanted to go home early. In my young mind, it was worth it.", "If you live in a northern climate (which I do) it's hard for an adult (who likes veggies) to get enough vit D in winter without fortified foods (like milk), let alone a picky eating child. \n\nFor my family, we all just take a vit d supplement.", "Ontario. Dairy disagrees with me. I chow down on kale and chard.", "Kale has no vitamin D. It has calcium and vitamin k. Trout and salmon have quite a bit as well as white mushrooms.\n\nThe best way to intake vitamin d is the sun. But that isn't an option for all of us."]}
