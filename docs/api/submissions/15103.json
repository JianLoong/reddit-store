What you're saying is really reasonable. You're basically spending more time on the road than at the birthday party. Plus the economic factor and the fact you're going anyway a few days later and you can spend that time with her.", "NAH.\n\nPersonal circumstances are not your fault and nobody has the right to demand how you spend your time and money. \n\nThere is nothing malicious in your reason for not attending. \n\nMaybe send a video message to your BIL, for him to share on the day. Essentially just make sure you get all your birthday wishes to her (without her knowing about the party \ud83d\ude09)", "NTA. This goes beyond a reasonable expectation. You are prepared to do something really nice for her, it's just not what her husband wants.", "NTA, but you have to do *something* funny for your sis.  Get a t-shirt made with your face on it and have someone wear it there...or...send a framed picture and a half eaten sandwich you ate and have someone set it up somewhere clearly visible...just so she can feel your presence.\n\nI'm sure you two have some inside jokes, so play off that.  It's about *an* effort in the end.  Especially at 40 (but really 29 and holding right?)", "NTA, you already made alternative plans with your sister. Sure, the party won't be as large as your BIL expected, but that is not a bad thing and is not entirely on your shoulders.", "NAH\n\nEveryone is right. BIL wants it to be special and 40 is a BIG deal. \n\nYou are right that it's a lot of driving. But. 40 is a big deal. \n\nCould you not go by yourself so you don't have to rush back by 10 AM? And maybe figure out a way to finish earlier on Saturday even by a few hours? \n\nI honestly think you will be happy you went. But maybe that's just me. It sounds like you have a good rel with your sister though... so that's why I think even an unreasonable amount of driving would be worth it. \n\nI just think you will never look back and be disappointed you were there, but you might look back and wish you had been.", "omg. Six hours one way? Whew. That's a lot to celebrate a birthday with someone. Unless I was staying all weekend, I'd probably not go myself. You'll be there five days later anyway. Can you Zoom a surprise party? (I could travel from Chicago to Cincinnati in five hours. WTH?)  \n\nNTA.", "NTA! Both you and your husband have work commitments. You already have plans to take your sister out a few days later. Driving 3 hours to show up at a party at 10PM then needing to get up and leave by 6:30AM is just not feasible.", "NTA.

You have let them believe you are going for 3 months. You knew the drive for 3 months. They have planned on you being there for 3 months. You give 4 days notice to cancel. You should have said no in the first place. I\u2019m sure all these other things didn\u2019t just get planned in the past week or even month.

It doesn't mean that you love her any less.", "NTA. I think she'd be able to tell you were pretty miserable/tired/rushed so best to see her when you're on top of your social game.", "NTA\nI think it is pretty understandable to not do that kind of drive late at night. Your brother in law does not seem to have considered other people's circumstances in his planning much. Your sister will still have a good birthday even with a smaller crowd or celebrating more than once. \n\nMy family lives 2-3+ hours away and would invite us to things without thinking that it would be pretty inconvenient for us to spend a good share of the day in the car and maybe only be at the event for an hour if we wanted to get home at a reasonable hour. An evening party is fine if you live within an hour commute, don't have kids or work the next day. My family would never drive to our area because it was suddenly too far- wasn't too far when they tried to guilt us about missing their event. We stopped going to many events and just planned visits to them that fit our schedule better.", "NTA. \n\nDo something to make her feel your presence, like someone said, a pic of your face on a tshirt for someone (maybe birthday girl herself when she gets there) to wear. FaceTime/Zoom/something on the actual day of her birthday. \n\nWhat you said about taking her out a few days later sounds great. Make her feel appreciated and loved, and just make her aware that you weren\u2019t trying to be an AH by not going to the party. It sounds like a good compromise, rather than doing the 6 hour round trip twice in a space of a few days.", "NTA - you will be seeing her a few days later and will get to spoil her. 40th birthdays should last a whole month anyway. Your BIL is just trying to manipulate you cause he\u2019s scared his plans are going to be altered.", "NTA.  I think it's weird to demand friends and family drive hours for birthday parties, regardless of whether it's a milestone birthday or not.", "NTA", "NTA you need to explain to your BIL that the attendance of this party does not equal how much you love your sister. It\u2019s sucks that it\u2019s bad timing and others have dropped but this is beyond your control and the solution is VERY reasonable.", "The video is a great suggestion!", "It's 3 hours one way, 6 hours total there and back. Zoom is a good idea.", "She knew that 3 months ago and accepted and cancelled with 4 days notice. Pretty shitty.", "A lot can change in 3 months. NTA", "A video or a live call that brother in law can put up on the TV even for a few minutes would be good. Do everything you are planning and just apologize to bil and do the live call etc. Hopefully she will understand and with the other plans it will turn out fine.\n\nNTA", "She couldn't take time off work. Didn't just cancelled on a whim.", "Nah, life happened. A lot can change in 3 months.", "I sort of agree with this, when did she ask for the time off that she wasn't able to tell her BIL until a few days before? If she had said earlier than maybe they could have rearranged the whole party. Can she not stay over and go the next day. she doesnt have much money but is planning to go to a concert a few days earlier and than treat her sister to allsorts.\n\n I dont know it seems the OP has made a lot of decisions, to make sure the party is a failure.", "What has changed? OP still has the same job and lives in the same place. She should've known there was a chance she couldn't guarantee that she'd get the day off and that would impact her ability to attend, she could've warned her BIL there was a possibility she couldn't make it well in advance.\n\nIt sounds like she didn't even think about the logistics until the last possible moment.", "It can and has. She\u2019s waited till 4 days before to deal with it.", "I completely get work commitments. I get stuff happens but people seem to be yeah fair enough, long drive, you are working. She\u2019s always known it\u2019s a long drive and I wonder when she and hubby tried to organise leave and if couldn\u2019t until recently didn\u2019t warn BIL that it could be an issue. Instead they accept, wait 3 months, 4 days to go with an oops response. They didn\u2019t plan properly.", "So? Work takes precedence over a party every time, and they did try to get the day off.  She is making it up to get sister later on since she can\u2019t be there. BIL needs to deal with that sometimes that\u2019s just how it is.", "Agreed and now the BIL has to deal with the fallout.\n\nThe thing people seem to be missing is that the other sister isn't going and he isn't going mad about that, because he knew well before hand. It seems to me that the reason the BIl is getting angry is that he has been organising this for a long time, given people months to sort themselves out or inform him if there are issues.\n\nAs you say, the OP has not been given any surprising information, that she has recently been informed. she would have know all the facts a few days after the BIL asked. She obviously has no cares about wasting his time.\n\nDef YTA", "More info needed. When do they get their shifts and how early can they request holiday leave. If someone invites me to an event, I\u2019d put in a holiday request immediately and follow it up. If I didn\u2019t want to take the leave, I\u2019d prewarn the party I might need to check my working hours due to the long drive making them aware it could be problematic. I\u2019d inform my employer and hope they take it into consideration. It could well be both parties are only able to request holidays a few days in advance which means both parties could not negate this long before but it seems more likely poor planning.", "What fallout though? Sis doesn\u2019t know the party is happening so she won\u2019t know either way that OP found out only recently she couldn\u2019t make it.", "**now the BIL has to deal with the fallout.**\n\nI think the clue is in the first sentence.\n\nThe fallout , is for the BIL, having to change arrangements.\n\nPartys taking planning, from places to food to drinks to costs to many other things. Surprise parties don't just happen. The BIL could have placed deposits, he may have arranged other surprises too. He may have chosen the place based on the people coming.\n\nAll of these things and more could be the fallout for the BIL and this isnt just anyone but close family.\n\nThe OP has know this information for along time, this hasnt been a late change in circumstances, she should have informed the BIL. The fact she hasn't makes her the AH. ( and not the fact she couldn't make it).", "I\u2019m not sure two people not going makes a huge difference unless BIL didn\u2019t invite anyone else", "Firstly its her sister so not just two people secondly in the actual post it says.... **I told my BIL that we won't make it to the party and he's really upset. Said he's been planning this for ages because he wants it to be really special for her and now a couple of people have dropped out and he's worried there won't be a crowd for her.**"]}
