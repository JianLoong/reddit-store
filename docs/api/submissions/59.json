I tutor kids in primary, so I don't make much, but I still saved up as much as I could. My parents wouldn't let me get a real job because they're very conservative about girls working. Hell, I didn't even get a phone till I turned 18, it's not like I couldn't buy one, I had the money to but in fear of my parents I never did. Saying that, I couldn't really tell how much money I had in my account unless I physically went to the bank or asked my mum who would just say wave me off saying money doesn't matter and that its very little??  \n\nRecently, and I mean like literally in September, I got my first ever phone for my birthday, and they were reluctant about it too, but I'm starting university next year, so I need one, so they had no choice either. I downloaded the app for my account to track my balance and stuff when I saw I had only $150 inside. It made no sense to me because I'd been saving for 4 years, and I never requested a card from the bank because my parents said I wouldn't need one, so I never used any money either.\n\nI got a full bank statement and found out I originally had around $2000 saved up. I called the bank saying I had some suspicious activity on my account, and they looked into it. They told me those transactions were from MY card, even though I never had one, and that all transactions were fine.\n\nI told my mother about it, and she just waved me off saying she \"borrowed\" some cash from time to time. I told her it wasn't her money and that it was hard earned money for me. She gave me a lecture about how she paid for my fees so I could be smart enough to even tutor kids, and that she let me tutor in the house so that cost money. When I told my dad about it, he said to think of it as \"parenting fees.\"\n\nI was beyond furious, so I cancelled my card, and called the bank to cut off access to my bank account for my parents, they couldn't see my balance or even spend my money, it didn't even matter at that point because I had less than $200 in my account. A week goes by and my mother one day comes up to my room fuming, telling me how MY card got declined when she was at the store and that it was \"embarrassing\" for her, and that someone nearly called the cops on her because they thought it was a stolen card. I told her she should've been arrested for using up my money and that I don't care if she got humiliated.\n\nShe told my father and now they're threatening to kick me out, I get that I'm 18, but I can't move out with like $100 in pocket, If I had my original amount of money, I'd gladly do it. I told them they had to cough up my money or I wasn't leaving, instead they called a \"family meeting\" with all my relatives just to call me out and say how selfish I was for \"counting every dime\" and that money ought to be shared or some shit.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667191186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi0wna/aita_for_cancelling_a_credit_card_my_mum_use/", "score": 2148, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

AND run your credit report to see if she has any other cards in your name. If she does then you definitely need to go to the police.", "NTA. Please contact the police & file some forms at your bank if they have an option for it. That was your money. Parents are not entitled to their children\u2019s money. You owe them nothing.", "Absolutely NTA. What gets me too is she was caught with the declined card while at the store, using your money to buy whatever. So I assume she was just using you as a bank when she wanted or needed instead of being the grown up. And the idea of parenting fees is so effed up because they chose to have you and then turn around and charge you fees to take care of you? They are toxic and I would do whatever you can to get away from them and keep it that way until you feel comfortable.

Gaslighting and manipulation will intensify, further damaging your future of independence. Family isn't defined by parasitic behavior.", "Definitely NTA,\nthey are terrible parents who don't even think of you as their kid. There are no such things as parenting fees but STEALING is very real and a crime, not to mention a big SIN since they're soo religious.. In case you're the type of saint who puts up with crap no matter what, ask yourself if you'd stay quiet or stand by while they did that to someone else. Ask yourself if you're going to let them keep using you, then eventually who ever you marry,  then your kids...?

Pretty shitty of her to do, but not something you can take legal action over.\n\nBut it sounds like your Mom had a debit card in your name, not hers. *That* is fraud/identity theft and can be prosecuted.\n\nOP, the best thing for you to do is likely to GTFO. Your family is controlling to the point where they've blocked you from a regular job, refused to get you a phone until just now, and have financially abused you. There is nothing healthy about this dynamic, and after 18 years it's not likely to change without drastic action.\n\nI would start reaching out to friends and extended family members to find a couch to crash on or a spare room. Get a job as you can, finish HS, and move on to college. Your family is highly unlikely to get better, and you need to focus on you and fulfilling your goals, not subsidizing abusers.\n\nNow, I'm petty as heck.

You had every right to cancel the card and it is horrible that she already used a majority of the money and was going to continue to use it until the account was empty. You should definitely hold your ground and tell them they need to give every penny back or else you will be pursuing legal action.

Your mum is TA and a thief though.\n\nIf you're in Australia, you could have set up your own bank account without a parent signatory or parental access at the age of 14. Between the ages of 14 and 17 you can choose to have a parent signatory to your account but it's not mandatory. If your mum was a signatory to your account she would be allowed to use the account. The fact that you were able to get the bank to cancel your card without having to get your mum to agree to it as well suggests to me that your mum was not a signatory though, and that she was most likely accessing your account illegally.\n\nIf the account was in your name, your bank debit card would have been mailed to you by your bank, and I assume your mum opened the mail that was addressed to you, took your card and set up a pin for herself on your card. She may also have installed the bank app on her own phone, set up login details etc on her phone for your account so she could keep track of balances etc.\n\nThis is very serious stuff.  Can you go into the local branch for your bank and have a chat to them? They should not have let your mum access your account, so you need to talk to them about how this happened. It sounds very similar to a type of elder abuse whereby an adult takes over the bank accounts of an elderly person (eg their parent!!) without their knowledge (and often bleeds their accounts dry). If your bank doesn't seem to be acting to remedy this fraud, you can contact AFCA, the Financial Ombudsman to complain - doing this tends to make banks respond.

I tutor kids in primary, so I don't make much, but I still saved up as much as I could. My parents wouldn't let me get a real job because they're very conservative about girls working. Hell, I didn't even get a phone till I turned 18, it's not like I couldn't buy one, I had the money to but in fear of my parents I never did. Saying that, I couldn't really tell how much money I had in my account unless I physically went to the bank or asked my mum who would just say wave me off saying money doesn't matter and that its very little??  \n\nRecently, and I mean like literally in September, I got my first ever phone for my birthday, and they were reluctant about it too, but I'm starting university next year, so I need one, so they had no choice either. I downloaded the app for my account to track my balance and stuff when I saw I had only $150 inside. It made no sense to me because I'd been saving for 4 years, and I never requested a card from the bank because my parents said I wouldn't need one, so I never used any money either.\n\nI got a full bank statement and found out I originally had around $2000 saved up. I called the bank saying I had some suspicious activity on my account, and they looked into it. They told me those transactions were from MY card, even though I never had one, and that all transactions were fine.\n\nI told my mother about it, and she just waved me off saying she \"borrowed\" some cash from time to time. I told her it wasn't her money and that it was hard earned money for me. She gave me a lecture about how she paid for my fees so I could be smart enough to even tutor kids, and that she let me tutor in the house so that cost money. When I told my dad about it, he said to think of it as \"parenting fees.\"\n\nI was beyond furious, so I cancelled my card, and called the bank to cut off access to my bank account for my parents, they couldn't see my balance or even spend my money, it didn't even matter at that point because I had less than $200 in my account. A week goes by and my mother one day comes up to my room fuming, telling me how MY card got declined when she was at the store and that it was \"embarrassing\" for her, and that someone nearly called the cops on her because they thought it was a stolen card. I told her she should've been arrested for using up my money and that I don't care if she got humiliated.\n\nShe told my father and now they're threatening to kick me out, I get that I'm 18, but I can't move out with like $100 in pocket, If I had my original amount of money, I'd gladly do it. I told them they had to cough up my money or I wasn't leaving, instead they called a \"family meeting\" with all my relatives just to call me out and say how selfish I was for \"counting every dime\" and that money ought to be shared or some shit.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So in reality the ended up not being your account. NTA", "A signatory on the account can do everything an account owner can do except close the account.

After all, why would they accept the liability of working directly with children? \n\nSee if you can find any bank that has a teen account option without a parent co-signer. It does not exist. The requirements are right there on their websites. Children can have bank accounts only if a parent/guardian co-signs.", "I think it makes a difference if their debit card or bank card is from a joint account. A credit card requires a credit application which would be identify theft as the mom would have applied using OP identity.

So i am looking into those services, quite literally had no idea abt them", "I suspect that was more in reference to the statement \"It\u2019s like a husband or wife using a bank card with their partners name on it\", which isn't actually how that works.", "Yep, I opened a checking account at 16 with my first job.  My parent's were not on the account.

They weren\u2019t extending me any kind of credit, there was no liability involved. They were just holding my money.", "No worries at all! This is just extra info and you don\u2019t need to take it to heart, but odds are that if this is their attitude towards you they possibly haven\u2019t taught you how to manage money etc. if that\u2019s the case, id recommend the book barefoot investor as a starting place. He is Aussie and takes you through a bunch of the basics. You\u2019re starting out so if you start out well, you can avoid a lot of drama and stress (like me getting myself in debt on stupid shit with my $500 credit card at 19 hhahaha). The aus finance community on Reddit here can also be a place to ask questions should they arise. Best of luck!", "DO NOT DO THIS IT WILL IMPACT THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PEOPLE THAT OWN THE HOUSE THAT YOU LIVE IN.\n\nJust smile and nod and MAKE AN ESCAPE PLAN.\n\nEdit: I've seen people on reddit take bad advice like the above and screw their living situation and ended up in very bad situations. Your parents sound unstable and if you call the banks fraud team they will make your life hell. The time to call the fraud time is WHEN YOU ARE IN A SAFE LIVING SITUATION NOT AT HOME WITH UNSTABLE CAREGIVERS.\n\nEdit 2: Since you are 18 I assume you are either still at school or have relationships with teachers.

Some people are extremely miserable and will give bad advice just because.", "I'll do that, thankyou!", "Except that wasn't what you said, it was \"It\u2019s like a husband or wife using a bank card with their partners name on it\". There's a very big difference between being added to someone's account such that one can use it and just being married to that person.\n\nIn quite a few places, a husband or wife using a bank card with their partner's name on it is technically committing fraud (not frequently bothered with). They'd need to use their own card issued for that account in their own name. Being married doesn't someone the equivalent of a signatory on an account.", "Oh god I'm so happy you saw one of my comments before doing anything.\n\nI'll say it again, you should talk to a teacher, even if you've already left school. You won't be the first person that they will have seen in your situation and will know the community resources available to you and the best way forward.\n\nEdit: Oh and good luck! It might be scary now, but things do get better. Remember that you need to **love yourself first** and take care of your own needs before you can help, or even entertain the idea of helping someone else. I say this because you will likely get innundated with family members (reddit likes the term \"Flying Monkies\") saying things like \"Look what you're doing to your family!\", \"You owe them for raising you!\", \"Why are you doing something so mean!\".\n\nRemember that you are currently trying to address your physical needs first, because you do not have a stable home environment, then you'll address your own mental needs, and then you can MAYBE try and think about other peoples emotional needs. But right now be laser focused on you you you you you you.\n\nEdit 2: And find the non-emergency police line for your state you are in, if you feel unsafe or have any questions, do give them a call - In WA it's 131444. I don't know if you've had any contact with the police before, but I have (including being the drunk asshole several times) and have never had a bad experience with them before.", "One more thing. I don\u2019t know what the job market is in australia but here in the US SQL is in very high demand. You can get a certification for $150 (typically less) online and most jobs that I\u2019ve seen here where SQL is the only software requirement pay anywhere from $35k-$45k. Not a crazy amount of money but you can survive on that pretty easily if you don\u2019t ball out on an apartment.\n\nNow I know you only have $150 to your name, so instead I\u2019ll offer this: https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science It\u2019s a data scientist course from IBM where you can access the courses for free (the certification costs money but I\u2019ll tell you that no one here in the US has EVER asked about my actual certificates) and it takes about 8 weeks to complete. They teach Python and SQL and data scientist jobs offer a pretty penny. \n\nFor your escape plan, think the long game. Set yourself up so not only do you get out in once piece, but excel in doing so. Data analytics and data science are VERY accessible fields that are in extremely high demand.\n\nObviously do what you need to do to get a financial foundation, but this is here for your next steps.", "Australian here. \n\nUnfortunately you may need a passport in addition to the 100 points of ID. I recently had to get the name on my Medicare card fixed (I have a tricky surname that was entered incorrectly somehow and it caused serious issues when I had to be admitted to hospital recently for the first time) and when I went into the Medicare office with the 100 points of ID they wouldn't talk to me and made me go home, get my passport, and come back. I asked them did they realise how stupid that was? Do they think all poor people in Australia can afford to get a passport so they can verify their identity to the government so they can get Centrelink allowances and assistance to buy stuff like food and pay rent? Of course it got nowhere, not that I expected that it would. \n\nAnyway, point is, get your 100 points of ID and get a passport and keep them at a friend's house. Borrow the money to do it from whoever will loan it to you. You will need it later on. \n\nAlso, you said you are going to university next year. I don't know if you are going locally or moving away to go, but either way, if you can stick it out until then you have an opportunity. Firstly, make sure the uni knows that no info is to be given to your parents. They shouldn't anyway due to privacy laws but parents like this will try to find stuff out behind your back anyway. Talk to the admissions office about it, if they can't help you add security (like a password) they may be able to direct you to someone who can. Also, most universities have online student portals these days, so make sure your password is long and complicated and be very careful about logging on and fully off again at home.\n\nThen, once you are sure your parents can't get any info out of the uni, get a part time job anywhere you can (although do try to get one somewhere your parents are unlikely to find out about it), and start saving that money. If I were you I'd open another account at a different bank and have it deposited there. Switch all your statements to online, and if you have a friend who wouldn't mind holding any mail for you, use her address wherever you have to give one. \n\nIf you are living at home while studying nearby, tell your parents that you have to attend more lectures per week than you actually do, then tutoring sessions, then group study sessions on top of it. Also say you are using the uni library facilities for assignment research, and tell them at least one assignment per semester is a group assignment that requires further study sessions with your group members. Check your uni library hours, I went to one that was open until 9pm five nights a week so hopefully it will be something like that. Between these things, you will now have an excuse to be out of the house \"at uni\" for several full days a week and perhaps weekend days also, so you can use that time to attend your part time job. \n\nPut all your fees onto FEE-HELP and also check your university website to see what scholarships are available. Most universities have more than you think, review the eligibility criteria and apply for any that you meet the criteria for. You never know, you may get one! This will all help you quickly accumulate a nest egg that you can use when you need to move out of home. \n\nReview the terms and conditions of the bank account you had open, it will tell you if it is permitted for parents to access it. I assume it was a child's account, which will have to have had a parent attached. You should be able to get these off your bank's website, if you can't find them go into a branch and ask. If it was illegal of her to spend your money, then talk to the police, but only do it after you have accumulated your Get Out Fund. \n\nBest of luck.", "Good. I wrote a longer comment above which I won't repeat, but just wanted to make sure you see this info. Once you are out of home and safely at your friend's house:\n\n1 - contact your bank to confirm the details of your account and whether or not action can be taken against your mother. There is info in another comment here about raising a complaint internally at the bank which may get you reimbursed by the bank, absolutely do that, if you can get your stolen money back it is the best outcome.\n\n2 - contact the police if you do have standing to make a complaint or bring charges against your mother. She is a thief and needs to experience consequences. \n\n3 - open a new account at a different bank. All payments from now on are directed here. If you are reimbursed by the original bank for the stolen money, transfer it to the new account and close down the old one.\n\n4 - contact Centrelink to find out what assistance you are eligible for and apply for everything asap. \n\n5 - look on the website of the uni you are going to and find out if there are any scholarships which you could be eligible for, no matter how large or small (some are for full degrees, some are for single subjects or stuff like text books, it varies). If there are some, read the application criteria very closely and apply for all of them. Repeat this every semester until you are finished your degree as every little bit helps. \n\n6 - start looking around immediately for part time jobs, and take whatever you can get. Once you settle into the new schedule for each semester, study ahead every chance you get, so that later on you can pick up extra shifts every now and again for extra money without running yourself short of time to complete assignments. If you aren't religious, offer to work the main religious holidays everyone else wants to take off. You will often get paid a higher rate on those days. Bank every dollar you make and spend as few as you can get away with. \n\nThis should help you quickly put together funds to get on your feet and secure a permanent place. You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and obviously a good work ethic given you have already been doing what you can within the restrictions placed by your parents. This will serve you well to get through university and then out into the workforce. \n\nAnd, cut off your parents and any family members who think that what your mother did was okay. It was not. She is a real arsehole."]}
