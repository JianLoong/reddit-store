My fence is not a traditional wood fence or anything, basically it's one of those metal fences with the gaps to see in through. You can find them at home depot.\n\nBecause they are still somewhat young, they are in an easily excitable and yappy phase when they see people. I also have cameras so I can check out to see what they are barking at.\n\nFor almost a month now, there has been this sort of older gentleman who walks past our house, stops when the puppies come, and is reaching through to pet them and whatever. That's one thing, but he will on occasion dig into his pocket, get out a little zip lock baggie, and give them treats.\n\nThe first time this happened, I immediately went out, but was very cordial about it. I explained to him that I don't like the pups  getting a hold of stuff unless I am the one to give them treats and such. One of them has a pretty sensitive stomach to a lot of things, so they eat a very strict diet. His response, I thought, was one of understanding and he said he wouldn't do it.\n\nA few days later, it happens again. Comes up to the fence, they get excited, he gives them treats, I go back out, I reintroduce myself, I ask him AGAIN to not do that, and he said that it's ok it's the same treats he gives his puppies. I reiterate that I don't care what the treats are, that I want it to be stuff only I give them. He seems like he understands again and walks away.\n\nThen this happens three more times, sort of the same spiel, my patience basically running out each time. The final time it happens, I do lose my cool and I am not proud of it. I basically cuss him out, tell him to stay away from my fence, leave my dogs alone, quit feeding them, and if he comes by again I am going to get the police involved. I stated that I told him in every nice, pleasant way I could, to fuck off, and yet he persists.\n\nHe flips me off, calls me a prick, and walks away.

Furthermore, there's no way to predict an animal's dietary restrictions by sight.  He should not be giving someone else's pets treats without asking, making him the asshole before you even said anything.", "NTA\n\nHis own opinion of whether it is ok is irrelevant. You asked him not to feed your dogs and he ignored the request.", "NTA. However, if you are really concerned perhaps you should be out there with your puppies so you can immediately intervene and prevent situations like that before they happen.\n\nETA: Make sure you check the yard for a while before letting them out. My area had some instances of poisoned bait in the parks, got a few dogs - very heartbreaking. You never know with some people who just aren't quite right in the head.", "NTA - Story for you , my neighbor had a beautiful German Shepard service dog. A lady walking by would feed it treats, even when asked not to. One day, the dog was gone. I asked my neighbor what happened, and the lady had been lacing the treats with poison and the dog passed because of it. There was a full investigation, drug screen etc. and the lady was charged and arrested.\n\nWhile some may have good intentions, others don't. People need to respect boundaries, it could save your pups lives.", "NTA - You tried to be polite and cordial on multiple occasions, and the guy completely disrespected your rules. The safety of your dogs is absolutely of the utmost importance, and if it takes getting a little mean to ensure their well-being, then so be it.", "NTA, you gave multiple polite warnings and have explained why to him. He agreed everytime but would still come by. I would feel the same someone giving my dog treats without my consent. Especially knowingly going against my consent.

Doesn't matter the diet, doesn't even matter if you got the exact same food as me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's your dog and you're the one who decide what goes into it and when.

Because then maybe he does have memory issues.\n\nStill NTA - they are your dogs and you know what is best for them. Just like humans they have allergies and some severe and he doesn't know that. You were polite the first few times and eventually he just needed to be told off. The cussing might have been a bit much. If you are concerned about memory issues though you may want to contact someone just to be nice.", "NTA. You told him calmly and politely several times to stop feeding your puppies through the fence before this latest incident. You weren't losing your cool, either, given the circumstances because I think anyone would have reacted as you did after someone repeatedly violated a clearly communicated boundary.\n\nTake some deep breaths or whatever else you need to do to get him out of your head because you don't need him living in there rent-free. Do not give yourself a hard time, either.\n\nI think calling the police would be completely fine at this point if this man continues violating your boundary.", "NTA\n\nI am fortunate that my dogs have solid digestive systems, but my friends dog has a very strict no grain diet or her pup gets wild diarrhea and skin issues. \n\nIf it's not your dog, don't feed it - it's a basic rule!", "It's never ok to feed someone else's pets without their owner's permission.  You were polite NUMEROUS times, and it didn't stick.  I don't care if you feed it to your own dogs, these are not your dogs, DON'T FEED A STRANGER'S DOGS!\n\n**NTA**, and if any of your dogs have digestive issues as a result of his \"treats\" then getting police involved would definitely be a good idea.", "NTA. You asked multiple times for him to stop. I would be upset if someone came to feed my pup through the fence after that too. No matter how nice they are, because I don't know what they're giving my dog. My dog also has a sensitive stomach so other people feeding it are a no go for me too. Maybe he's one of those people that doesn't get it until someone loses it at them. Hopefully, he'll stay away but I'd keep an eye out just in case.", "NTA - You have this guy ample time to learn your rules for your dogs.\n\nAnd all dogs should be trained to not take anything edible from strangers, I\u2019ve had a dog be poisoned by someone feeding it through a fence.

Get away from my dogs!' Who knows what he was feeding them.

I wouldn't have been pleasant the second time. Your pet, your rules.", "NTA. Reminding him 5 times is 4 times too many.

Why did he say he understood when he clearly had plans to defy your wishes time and again?\n\nCan law enforcement actually do something about this?", "Poor old guy! What has our society come to?\n\nI'm basically in the same place as you \u2013 my cat has allergies and I'd be angry if someone were harming her by ignoring my instructions.  However, I feel bad for this older gentleman.\n\n(Based on a healthcare perspective,) if it were someone in their 30's ignoring your wishes, I'd feel differently \u2013  but this may be a lonely person who lives alone, had puppies growing up and can't handle them now, and maybe even has a touch of dementia-related softening that makes it harder for them to think through their actions. It's a sweet gesture for them to have this simple daily routine, making friends with the other living creatures around them.\n\nIf you'd like the puppies to receive certain treats only, you could give a bag of those treats to him specifically for that purpose, or hang a plastic tub of the treats where it is accessible to him on your fence, so he can reach in and get one. If you feel like it in the future, everyone might be happier with an apology and gesture like that.", "NTA lots of prior comments pretty much cover the subject, but if the guy hasn't come back he's probably not having issues with memory, and has finally gotten the hint.\n\nAt least, that's the hope.", "NTA but doubt he will stop. Is it worth putting an electric fence about a foot inside the main fence so he can't access them. \nHate people feeding other people's pets. Know people who lost horses to it. It may be unsuitable food, pet may have allergies or on special diet for health, it can encourage bad behaviour if they aren't fed, stranger's fingers near teeth never a good idea in case of false claim.\n\nEdit to add : perspex sheeting tied to the fence can be a fairly cheap emergency extra barrier. But treats can still be thrown", "NTA, and I'd file a police report, if that's a thing where you live, just to start a paper trail in case he comes back *again*.\n\nHopefully he was just a harmless, forgetful old guy that loves dogs.\n\nBut, yknow... be safe.", "NTA He thinks he know your dogs better than you like wtf?! Just because HIS dogs is okay with those treats, he can't treat them to other dogs - especially since you told him several times not to! He has an own dog, so he should leave your puppies alone! \n\nYou didn't overreacted. If you talk and talk and they just smile and still do it again, you just get crazy.", "Nta. Protect your dogs. He didnt give a fuck whether he would hurt your puppy with a sensitive stomach, and that is reason enough. He is just an obstinate old man", "Nta. You told him more than once. If you have chain link, invest $100 into slats. Video record him too Incase things get heated and you have to forcibly stop him from trespassing etc.", "NTA you gave him several chances to shape up first", "NTA\n\nThey're your puppers, so you make the call. He enjoys the puppies. As an older individual, he likely doesn't see anything wrong with what he's doing and doesn't respect you enough to listen. Let it go.", "I'm going with NTA because I've had a similar experience. We moved to a new town and our back neighbor was \"that\" neighbor, the local crazy lady who was always in everyone's business, trying to sue people, etc. Lo and behold, our dogs suddenly start having stomach issues, which I find out about when I wake up to see that it looks like one of them ran through our house, with liquid diahrrea pouring out their ass, all over the carpet. Finally find out, after this happening a couple of times, that Crazy was giving our dogs homemade dog treats that she made. She did stop giving them after I asked her not to at least but I was pissed because she didn't seem surprised that her treats gave them the shits.
