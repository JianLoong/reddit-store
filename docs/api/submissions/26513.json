Anyways we were driving away at the same time and she kept slowing down really abruptly so I went around her. She then started flashing her brights at me and sped up right next to me signaling me to roll my window down. She basically came to a complete stop and told me about my headlight and I told her I knew about it. I tried to make it quick and I sped back up pretty fast but a truck slammed into her. She wasn\u2019t hurt or anything but her car was super fucked up. \n\nI obviously made sure she was okay and apologized but it made no sense to stop in the middle of the road (the speed limit is 55) and expect not to get hit. The next day at work she told me her car was totaled and she was going to pay $42 a day for a rental car until she finds a new car. I apologized and she asked me if I\u2019m seriously not going to pay it. I\u2019m a broke college student so I really can\u2019t pay 100\u2019s of dollars when this really wasn\u2019t my fault??

Honestly a lot of them don\u2019t like me or my bestfriend that also works there (we\u2019re both 21f) and the rest of the bartenders are like 40-50. They are just mean to us for no reason. \n\nI know that I shouldn\u2019t have been driving with my headlight out but I mean there was nothing I could do.

She stopped her own car in the middle of a highway to talk to you.  What the hell kind of driving is that?  She did it to her own car and you have absolutely zero responsibility for this lunacy.  Your coworkers are assholes too.  Let them all have their stupid opinion.  You did nothing wrong.

And not responsible for the accident at all. She chose to make a series of stupid decisions because she thought telling you right then and there about the headlight when there was nothing you could have even done about it was so important. Stopping on a highway for a non-emergency situation and especially not putting on hazards is so stupid I can\u2019t even describe. \n\nAnd rental coverage on her insurance would have been like $5-$15/6 months. It\u2019s stupid cheap. She chose to not pay it, now she\u2019s paying for the full rental. All on her.", "With that level of driving intelligence, her car was not long for this world regardless.", "Next time it comes up all her if she's paying for the truck driver who she fucked up by disobeying traffic laws and all common sense.

NTA, don\u2019t pay and save up your money so you can move on in life!", "NTA. She saw the results of being a well-intentioned busybody.

It's totally on her and you have nothing to apologise for.", "NTA. Someone\u2019s car having one light out isn\u2019t worth what she did to tell you. She should have texted, emailed, or told you in person the next day. Coming to a near stop in the middle of the road is dangerous to everyone involved. The only time it is worth doing that is if there is a major life threatening problem with the car, like you see the car is on fire or a tire has gone completely flat. Even then, she should have signaled to you and gotten you to  pull over, not stop in the middle of the road. It was all on her. No one stops all the paddidles they see on the highway, they just joke about them.", "The insurance of the person who hit her should pay for the rental unless they were uninsured?  What am I missing here?", "NTA!  It's not your fault she got hit. If you are driving, and someone is trying to get you to stop, then don't stop unless they are a police officer.", "NTA...she sped up next to you so she wasn't even in her lane. She knows how close you live so she could have followed you being only 2 minutes away and told you", "Was it a single lane?\n\nSo she decides to full stop on a highway (55 speeds seem right for a highway).

She probably thought she was doing you a favor, but you aren't responsible for her poor decisions.\n\nHer insurance should pay for it.   If she doesn't have insurance - well, that's another poor decision.", "NTA. That's something you text someone about later, not stop in the middle of the road.

She showed horribly poor judgement, and unfortunately caused an accident s a result.  She could have called your or texted you after she got home and been just fine.  Heck, told you the next day.  \n\nIt was not an emergency, and she stopped in the middle of a busy road.  Seems the costs are fully on her.", "NTA she\u2019s an idiot. A headlight that\u2019s out isn\u2019t an emergency. She could\u2019ve flashed her lights and she couldn\u2019t stopped on a safe part of the road. TF", "NTA.  Actually, it was the truck that rear-ended her at fault. Did she contribute - sure, stopping in the middle of the lane.  But there's no excuse for rear-ending anyone - default judgment is that the truck driver was going too fast or not paying attention, with next to no extenuating circumstances.  If truck driver is unknown (no insurance, hit and run) her Underinsured Motorist coverage should apply if she carried that coverage.  (This is pertinent for the U.S., I work in insurance although not in claims.)", "She created a dangerous situation herself. Trying to tell someone about a headlight, which isn't that big of a deal, does not justify driving dangerously or stopping on a major road. It's not like your headlight being out was going to cause an immediate accident. She has some kind of self importance issue and lacks common sense for thinking she somehow has to communicate that info instantly by driving like a maniac. NTA", "NTA at all, is she braindead? Was she drunk? Who on earth thinks that is a good idea?", "Not your fault.   And who cares if coworkers don't like you.   They aren't your friends.   You just work there, same as them.  You all just go your separate ways when the shift is over.  I wouldn't pay.", "NTA and why would you apologize? You didn't crash into her car or make her stop in the middle of the road.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say ESH. \n\nClearly the work colleague is an AH for stopping but you knowingly drove your car in the dark with a headlight out. Changing a bulb is a simple job that should not involve an appointment so could have easily been done the day of the shift. \n\nI\u2019m happy to change this if it\u2019s some weird Xenon or LED light that can only be changed at a garage.", "TF? There are these AMAZING things called mobile phones now! She could have just called you. NTA", "And it doesn\u2019t sound like a place where they could pull fully off the road. You\u2019re lucky that you both weren\u2019t killed.", "Haha no I promise I\u2019m not calling them old! It\u2019s just so silly that people their age bully coworkers in their early 20\u2019s", "No, she/her insurance has to pay. She had no business being in that lane.", "I agree, I have children that age and I look out for them at work, it\u2019s insane to me as well!", "I thought all impacts from behind were the fault of the rear driver?  Either way I think both were pretty irresponsible.", "I\u2019m not sure i think it\u2019s usually deemed whoever rear ended the cars fault but this was clearly her fault", "I figured she was hit head on, but it's not clear. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", ">My parents wouldn\u2019t even let me do that\n\nYou're an adult.
