I\u2019m a bartender and me and the girl I worked with that night were leaving at the same time. One of my headlights was out, I had an appointment to get it fixed the next day and literally lived a minute and a half away. Anyways we were driving away at the same time and she kept slowing down really abruptly so I went around her. She then started flashing her brights at me and sped up right next to me signaling me to roll my window down. She basically came to a complete stop and told me about my headlight and I told her I knew about it. I tried to make it quick and I sped back up pretty fast but a truck slammed into her. She wasn\u2019t hurt or anything but her car was super fucked up. \n\nI obviously made sure she was okay and apologized but it made no sense to stop in the middle of the road (the speed limit is 55) and expect not to get hit. The next day at work she told me her car was totaled and she was going to pay $42 a day for a rental car until she finds a new car. I apologized and she asked me if I\u2019m seriously not going to pay it. I\u2019m a broke college student so I really can\u2019t pay 100\u2019s of dollars when this really wasn\u2019t my fault?? She told a few of our co workers about it and some of them agree with her that it\u2019s kinda my fault. Honestly a lot of them don\u2019t like me or my bestfriend that also works there (we\u2019re both 21f) and the rest of the bartenders are like 40-50. They are just mean to us for no reason. \n\nI know that I shouldn\u2019t have been driving with my headlight out but I mean there was nothing I could do. We got off work at 1am so my someone picking me up wasn\u2019t really an option and like I said I don\u2019t even live 2 minutes away.

You didn't tell her to stop. You weren't even in her vehicle.  She caused an accident, not you.  NTA.\n\nSounds like it'll be a toxic work environment if she's turning everyone against you though so you may want to apply at other bars/restaurants just in case.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would YOU pay for HER car? She was the driver, and you were not even in her car, and YOU were not involved in her accident.", "NTA.\n\nI tell people if their brake lights or tail lights are out, but I assume they can figure out if their headlights are out.  Also, I'd never try to tell someone on a freeway or come to a complete stop on a 55 mph road.  It's just too dangerous.  She's a coworker; it can wait until the following day or text or call.  You did nothing to cause the accident.  She made a choice to try to tell you immediately, in a high speed traffic road.  It was a dangerous choice, especially since there were other, safer options.", "F that noise. NTA\n\nShe did something stupid. I would question the sanity of anyone who agrees with her. No way she is blaming you for that. It's a headlight. It's not as though your car were on fire.", "NTA she's just putting the blame on you for her not minding her own businnes and driving recklessly.", "NTA. There was no reason for her to stop the way she did. It was her actions that caused the accident. And I'm curious why the truck driver's insurance isn't covering the expense? Even if she was stopped the driver should have been able to avoid her.", "Not your fault.", "NTA. What she did was dangerous and the inevitable happened. That\u2019s on her. You don\u2019t owe her anything.", "She chose to position her car in an unsafe way all by herself.\n\nThat's definitely not on you.\n\nNTA", "NTA  \nmy brother in christ does she not have your number as your coworker? could she not have sent a text? shit even if not, SHE chose to do something stupid as fuck rather than find a reasonable way to tell you. Honestly, she didn't even NEED to tell you, that's what cops are for and driving with one light out isnt a fucking emergency. she chose to do something stupid and something stupid happened. Talk to your boss about her talking shit at work and shut it the fuck down right now or just find a new job because those people seem awful  \n\n\nalso be weary of your car, park where you know the camera is aimed", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She stopped in the middle of the road where the speed limit was 55. That alone should tell you she is a bad driver. What did she think would happen, you were gonna instantly fix on the side of the road? She could have safely texted you when she was done driving. She messed up, don\u2019t pay her.", "You live that close you should've walked while your car was defected.  The driving slow and flashing lights is a usual behaviour to show another driver something is wrong so she was doing a good thing for you.  Especially since you shouldn't have been driving.   \n\nIt wasn't your fault in any way the truck hit her.", "Nta\n\nNo just no", "NTA she could have called or texted you. Stopping in the road is entirely her fault. That\u2019s probably why she\u2019s so mad bc the accident is 100% her fault and not yours or the other driver\u2019s.", "Its your fault?  She stopped her own car in the middle of a highway to talk to you.  What the hell kind of driving is that?  She did it to her own car and you have absolutely zero responsibility for this lunacy.  Your coworkers are assholes too.  Let them all have their stupid opinion.  You did nothing wrong.  NTA", "Plus, one headlight being out isn't some kind of emergency that needs to be (or can be) fixed right that minute.  It's not like, I don't know, a semi-truck with the trailer part raised that's about to go under a bridge and get it ripped off.\n\nThe coworker just created a dangerous situation for no good reason.", "Also, why is she blaming YOU and not the truck that slammed into her?", "This could have been a text after she got home.", "I would have to cross a super busy highway so walking isn\u2019t really an option", "a broken headlight is not a 'defected' car. give me a break.", "Because it was her fault, not the trucks and she knows she can't try to bully the truck driver into paying it.", "You can't cross a road?!  \n\nThere are always options.", "Crossing a freeway at 1 am. \n\nYeah sounds like a smart thing to do.\n\nOP needs to fix the headlight but definitely not Leeroy jenkins across a freeway at night.", "No I\u2019m not crossing a road with cars going 60-70mph??? It\u2019s a very busy road with constant traffic. My parents wouldn\u2019t even let me do that", "I also said there other options... taxi...lift from co-worker.   My best friend, many years ago, was killed by a car with only one headlight. I saw it and will never forget it.  So I'd rather people like OP are told they have other choices than to put people at risk for their own comfort.", "LOL. And in the middle of the night.  What an ass.   \n\nThen get a taxi because if your excuse for driving a defected car 2 minutes is because you can't walk across a busy road you still have responsibility to find another option.", "I get that. I have a friend who went in a similar fashion. \n\nSorry about that the crossing the freeway comment got me. \n\nThey do have options. Fixing that headlight being top priority.", "You\u2019re being a bit dramatic. I wasn\u2019t going to cause any harm while on the high way for 30 seconds. I live in a small town taxis aren\u2019t a thing. No sane person would walk across a busy road with cars going that fast.", "I thankfully got it fixed the next day lol", "I'm grateful you heard my story,  thank you.  Sorry you've experienced the same thing.  \ud83d\ude4f", "> You\u2019re being a bit dramatic.\n\nYou\u2019re being a bit hypocritical, carrying on the way you are and accusing others of being dramatic.\n\nI\u2019m sorry about your friend but their death wasn\u2019t the OP\u2019s fault.", "Dramatic right?  Years ago my best friend was killed by a car with only one headlight.   I saw it happen.   I watched him die on the side of the road.  To be honest I held him and told him everything would be alright while he was dying.   Fucking dramatic hey.\n\nThere is harm in driving a car illegally.  It has happened to many more people than the one I know.  No taxis?  Get someone from work to drive you, ask a friend, cross a road and take the risk on yourself .... I don't care.", "I\u2019m sorry that happened to you but no I don\u2019t agree with you your the ass for suggesting I walk across a busy highway in the middle of the night. That\u2019s significantly more dangerous than driving with one headlight.", "FFS... coworker was a dumbass for STOPPING ON THE FREEWAY. And  it's not like OP had no head or tail lights.\n\nI think we found the coworker.", "Small town. Middle of the night.  Freeway wouldn't be that busy.  At least the danger is one you've put on yourself rather than killing someone else. \n\nBut why are you focused on that so much?   I've also said you've had *other options* which you've ignored.   You know,  get a lift from anyone else being one. \n\nI've tried to make you aware that your actions aren't as innocent as you wish.  If you genuinely believed there was no danger then I've told you my first hand example to show you.   You don't care and I've nothing more to say to you.  YTA.", "I originally said that OP was not at fault for being hit by a truck from behind.   I then shared why only driving with one headlight is dangerous because I wouldn't have thought it was a big deal if I hadn't had that experience.", "Every time you have a little problem with your car you call a tow compagnie and you go in taxi to the garage?", "You also said OP should walk across the busy road where coworker was hit by the truck at 1am which is far more dangerous than driving with 1 headlight. How certain says you that the accident you witnessed was caused by driving with 1 headlight? You should like you're saying \"it's not your fault but it's your fault\""]}
