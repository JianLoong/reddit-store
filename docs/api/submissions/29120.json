Where I will leave him be and let him figure things out. \n\nMy wife currently does not work I work 4/10s. So during the week she typically gets up with the baby and takes care of him. When my alarm goes off I usually take him for an hour or so and let her nap. She is constantly tired and I've tried encouraging her to get a sleep study because she actually gets more sleep than me, but it isn't good sleep. On my days off I usually get up with him and let her sleep in as long as she wants.\n\nOver the weekend she started not feeling good. So last night (Monday), I offered to get up with the kid in the morning. Many times he will wake up around 630 and just kind of chill in his crib without a sound. My wife will see this on the monitor and immediately jump up and go in there.  Many times though he will either lie back down or when you pick him up he will go back to sleep on my shoulder for over an hour.  \n\nSo fast forward to this morning. She kept the monitor on her side but woke me up saying he was up, are getting up with him like you said? I said yes,  got up put on clothes used the bathroom and went to get him. When I opened the door, he was lying back down, so I backed out and closed the door. I went back in the room to grab the monitor and see if he nodded back off. My wife insisted that he was not asleep.  I said I know, but he may fall back asleep. She kept insisting he's up. I said, I'm watching him I got this.  She wouldn't let it go. This whole time he was lying down with little fidgeting. Finally I said let me take care of him or just get up with him yourself. She said fine I'll just get up with him. She goes into his room and he stands up. So I turned off the monitor and went back to sleep for an hour.

It\u2019s good for the baby to learn to smooth themselves and go back to sleep or just roll a little bit around. If he doesn\u2019t cry he is content. And if he is not he ll get vocal or cry.", "Appears y\u2019all have a different perspective of parenting your child. Pretty common. Perhaps you should have a conversation about that. Ask your wife what she believes will happen if she doesn\u2019t jump up as soon as baby whines or wakes up.\n\nYou may not always agree on what parenting style to use, that\u2019s not a bad thing. You just need to remember you both love your child & want the absolute best for him. As long as the goal is the same for both of you, it doesn\u2019t really matter what path you each take to get there.\n\nNAH", "Nta. My kid used to wake up for a while and just lay in her crib.

Sleep apnea kills.", "I think this is one of those situations where on a logical level you are probably \"right\", but that doesn't mean you're not at least a little bit of the AH. Like, I feel like you saying you'd wake with him is basically saying that you'll do what needs to be done to help comfort her. Now yes, I would probably agree that that there was no reason for her to get out of bed, but you know she was going to do so. It seems like your priority wasn't so much making her feel better, but completing the \"job\" you said you'd do.\n\nWith that said, the main takeaway with this is that you guys need to have a big talk over parenting styles, and try to find a compromise. This dynamic may be cute in a family sitcom, not so much here.", "Are you saying your 9mo. old drinks wine? (he wines).\n\nSeriously, NTA.  Baby is learning to self soothe!

But it\u2019s not because of your parenting style. The whole agreement for you to get up with the baby was for the purpose of letting your wife rest and relax. You knew that not getting the baby when he woke at 6:30 was going to stress your wife out. You knew when you were arguing with her during her sleep in that it was stressing her out. You know that if she\u2019s stressed out she\u2019s not going to sleep or relax. If you truly wanted to give her a break and let her rest what\u2019s the harm of putting your own process aside one morning and picking up the baby? I think I\u2019m the near future you two need to have a conversation where you can lay out parenting styles and maybe meet in the middle more often. Being a \u201chands off dad\u201d isn\u2019t helping your wife. But helicoptering isn\u2019t going to help your kid either. \n\nSo- YTA for not just getting the kid out of bed and for going back in and fighting with your wife when you agreed to let her sleep and relax. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt you to grab the baby and let him sleep on your shoulder while you watch tv or something. At the very least it\u2019s good bonding for you both and your wife could have rested and everyone would have been happier at the end of the day.", "[deleted]", "NTA, when you said you would take it then she needs to back off. If she cannot do that then it is her problem.", "I agree with some of what you are saying. If baby is just moving around a bit and it was off schedule (or inconvenient for me) I would wait to see if he settled. If he was \"chilling\" quietly at 6:30 AM and I was trying to get him wait and get up and feed at 7:00 AM, I would just let him peacefully chill. \n\nI did have to laugh when you said,  '*Any time he wines or anything she is there picking him up. Where I will leave him be and let him figure things out.\"*\n\nI am wondering how the baby figures things out? \"Get up, kid, and change your own diaper. Then go get your bottle from the kitchen.\" LOL\n\nWhile I see no problem with leaving a content baby on his own, I would check to see why he is crying. Sometimes the solution is simple, sometimes they do need a bit of extra comfort, like when they are teething.\n\nYour wife is still new to motherhood and has suddenly found herself totally responsible 24/7 for this helpless creature who cannot communicate with words. Every time she thinks she has a problem figured out, the child then moves onto the next stage with it's own unique problems. She is exhausted and still sleeping with her ears open. Give her some slack and help her work out things together. Remember that she, along with the baby, also needs lots of TLC,\n\nMother of 3 happy, well adjusted kids.", "I'm going to say a soft YTA because becoming a new parent is hard and everyone is doing what they can.\n\nListen, if you promise to get up with the baby *so she can rest* it has to be done *so she can rest* . She can't rest with him awake without an adult. I remember being a first time parent and I was very much the same way. Hormones did not allow me to sleep if my baby had a finger twitching. I tried. I just couldn't. If I was being granted some nap time by my husband, my husband went and took the baby. I could unclench enough to nap *once he had the baby*.\n\nBut you promised to have the baby so she could rest. And then you didn't actually *have* the baby which prevented her from resting. And then told her to handle it herself, ensuring she got no rest at all.\n\nIt sounds to me like the two of you need to get on the same page. Both with parenting and what you are each actually capable or incapable of, regardless of personal preference. You've presented this like \"she's a helicopter mom so she's a bit crazy\" with an added \"she has sleep issues\". But when the time came to help with the sleep issue you refused to budge on the thing you feel she is being unreasonable about. Either help or don't. Offering to help and then making sure she knows how unreasonable you think she is as you don't help is not good.", "Got to admit, it looks a lot like your parenting \"style\" automatically defaults to \"do as little as possible.\" That seems really convenient for you.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m a grown adult and sometimes I wake up super early (to pee) and then I go back to bed and sleep for a couple more hours. I see no reason the baby needed attending to other than a probably diaper change, but there is a chance that disruption would cause the baby to not go back to sleep so easily.", "You two need to talk more. Do you know why your wife gets up as soon as he wakes up? I usually get up with my daughter while my husband sleeps in because he\u2019s terrible in the mornings and he leads more on other housework. I usually get up as soon as she\u2019s awake if it\u2019s after 6 regardless of whether she\u2019s kicking off or not. This is because I know that I only have a finite amount of time before she will have a meltdown out of hunger (I swear I don\u2019t starve her but she is ravenous every morning) and she needs to be changed, dressed and breakfast made before I can feed her. If your kid usually wakes up at half six and you leave them lying there for another half hour or whatever you might be creating a problem for yourself further down the line. That\u2019s what I\u2019d be thinking anyway. \n\nWhat would\u2019ve been good to do might be to go get breakfast and yourself ready while he wakes up abit more. \n\nIf your wife is tired even though she\u2019s getting sleep it sounds like she\u2019s just burnt out which is easy when you\u2019re looking after a baby. She needs to let you do more and you need to at least understand where each other is coming from if you\u2019re going to have different approaches so that you can respect the other. If your wife is with your kid most of the time remember she knows a lot about him. You can learn from each other.\n\nI totally get where the frustration is coming from on both sides.", "NTA. I agree with you.\n\nFundamentally by now your baby boy is used to *both* your parenting styles and is secure and comfortable.", "NTA This a critical time where it is vital to allow self soothing and time to just let them be . He wasn't fussy. He was just chilling out in bed. My daughter was the same way. She may be up and jabber to herself for 20 minutes and pass back out or may decide she's ready to start the day. She let me know when she was ready to get up. If he gets used to being grabbed the second he wakes up you could be in for a disasterous 12 month regression period. Encouraging independence and self soothing is the key to you and your partner's sanity.", "Sorry but YTA, your wife's approach is better for your son's development, especially while he's still little. He can't really self soothe or 'figure things out' yet, you have to teach him how. Regular routines and fast responses from parents are important for babies. The more hands off approach will get more appropriate as your kid develops but this story just makes you seem uncooperative.", "YTA. \nYou offered to help and instead snapped at your wife because you disagreed when she wanted you to take action. \nBut also just the way you describe everything makes you sound assholish. And arguing with people in the comments by telling them their kids will have dependency issues? \nLook dude, you can have your life views. But you don't have to be an asshole about it.", "NAH\nIs there a possibility your wife has PPD?  Or maybe an iron deficiency or some hormone issues after having the baby? Life is tough when you have a baby and society puts massive pressure on parents, especially mothers, to be \"perfect\". It sounds like your wife needs more support from you and you both need to decide how you want to raise your baby.", "NTA, yeah, helicopter mom at her finest and this is probably the reason she sleeps so badly.", "NTA. She needs to let you parent how you need to. Parents end up with their own little routines and styles with their kids. We have a 6yo and we definitely do things differently still. It's important she let's you do your thing and create a bond with your child. One on one time is so important.", "\n>So last night (Monday), I offered to get up with the kid in the morning.\n\nVery soft YTA.\n\nYou OFFERED to get up with him in the morning because she wasn't feeling well. This wasn't the right time to try and make your point (that he was fine by himself and may fall back asleep). That conversation should take place another time in another setting.", "Nah, I will say though i am surprised your baby doesn\u2019t sleep in your guys room. It suggests for the first year to lower chances of sids. \n\nIt sounds like your wife could be dealing with ppa. I had it with my first. I held him so much and wanted to be awake if he was even if he was chilling by himself. I would see about having your wife talk to someone to see if she has it.", "Gently, YTA. You could have communicated \"he is up but it is okay to be spending some time on his own if he isn't crying. I will keep watching him.\". Learning how to self-soothe is an important developmental step. You going back to sleep after she was obviously anxious and you didn't calm her is the asshole move.", "NTA but you and your wife need to talk about how you both parent and come to some kind of compromise. It was a dick move to go back to sleep after you told her you'd watch him, though. Especially if she isn't feeling well.", "YTA. She\u2019s making sure the kid feels secure and attached. You just sound lazy.\n\nLet me guess, you\u2019re an advocate of \u201ccry it out?\u201d", "NTA, but you two need to sit down and talk about this and get on the same page. Neither or you are doing anything harmful to baby, you're not ignoring him crying etc., so either way sounds fine. So you two need to either agree that each of you does things differently on their morning, and let the other get on with it when it's theirs. Or you need to agree on one way that works for both of you. If that doesn't work for her at all, then I guess mornings have to be her thing, though that's not really satisfactory at all. It would be much better if you could reach some form of agreement.\n\nAs far as the sleep study thing goes... I highly doubt that would really help right now, because I strongly suspect her low quality of sleep comes from anxiety about being ready to jump up at the tiniest sound your son makes. A study in a sleep lab would probably not yield meaningful results in that context. I think it's more important for your wife to learn to relax a bit, by whatever way, though I fully realise that's easier said than done. Maybe some form of therapy or parenting counselling you can do together? Maybe showing her that you really can take care of son in the mornings on your own just fine in some way - maybe a weekend off for her at a spa or with family or something? Or even just a day where she really commits to not interfering AT ALL? I don't really have any bright ideas, but I do think that anxiety that something could go wrong if she's not involved in every step is at the core of a lot of your problems.", "NTA - The kids ok, that's what matters. I think your wife has something else going on, her behavior as described reads a lot like anxiety. She should be going through the steps to identify why her sleep is bad and her anxiety is manifesting as a helicopter parent situation, because that will start to affect your kid as he grows. \n\nLike my mom was pretty anxious overall as a person and it definitely affected me permanently.", "YTA. If my kids got up late, their whole nap schedule was a mess. And then I was the one who would have to deal with the fallout.\n\nLetting the baby babble for a few minutes when he wakes up and is content is one thing. Going back to bed and messing up the schedule, not getting him up to change a diaper and feed him is another. You said you\u2019d get up with him to give her a break, not just leave him in there. You didn\u2019t do it and you\u2019re the one who ended up getting more sleep instead\u2026.", "YTA You knew she\u2019d get him if you didn\u2019t. You should have cared for him in a way that permitted her to sleep. \n\nAnd what\u2019s this sleep study nonsense? There was nothing wrong with her sleep before Baby. She doesn\u2019t have an issue that some better help with the baby wouldn\u2019t cure", "YTA. I\u2019m like your wife and luckily my husband and I share the same parenting styles. I wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep if I knew my baby was awake only because you\u2019ve stayed you\u2019re fine letting him fuss. She probably doesn\u2019t trust you to care for his needs properly because of your hands off parenting style. Good parents respond to their children\u2019s needs and not let a literal baby \u201cfigure it out\u201d.", "NTA....if she's going to let you take care of him in the morning, then she needs to believe you've got this under control.", "YTA", "NTA.  Babies entertain themselves.  That's how they learn.  If he's not crying,  just leave him alone. That was my favorite time. Laying in bed listening to my daughter babble on the monitor .", "NTA I am the sahm and I do the same thing as you. I actually go in his room, change his diaper and give him milk and medicine as needed then put him back in bed where he sleeps 30 minutes to 3 more hours. I make him comfortable enough to continue sleeping.", "Yta omg you suck. And I only got a paragraph in", "Questions first, perhaps not to answer if too personal but to take into consideration. Is she still breastfeeding? Does she do all the dr checkups, etc? Is she doing all the housework in addition to majority of childcare? Did she have a c-section, or a rough pregnancy?\n\nThese could heavily contribute to her being constantly tired. It's not always lack of sleep that makes people tired. It could be simple exhaustion from being run ragged, or lack of nutrition. Breastfeeding takes A LOT out of you. And if she had a c-section or a rough pregnancy, she could still be dealing with side effects.\n\nHave you simply asked, (non judging-ly. Genuinely, sincerely.) why she gets up with him immediately? Or why she does anything the specific way she does for that matter? Is she perhaps trying to keep him on a schedule or prevent him disliking his crib? Another commenter pointed out that there's a lot of fears with newborns, especially for first time parents, and especially when you are the primary caretaker.\n\nHaving been there, it can feel like you have to do all the work and be even more attentive when you feel like your partner isn't doing as much as they should. Saying you're a \"hands-off\" parent is a bit of an immediate red flag. Allowing your kid independence is one thing but using it as an excuse to do as little as possible is entirely different. Reading your comments, you sound a bit like this, or you're just a bit of a jerk. You asked if you're the AH, if you're going to do that you should be ready for a bit of criticism.\n\nBottom line/TLDR\nYTA because the purpose of you getting up with the kid was to let your sick wife rest. You know how she is. You should have gotten up with the kid. You hid the actual question by talking about how your kid is fine sitting in his crib, and your wife is a helicopter mom (with very little proof of it) but this wasn't the point of the situation. Perhaps a bit of consideration, reflection, and problem solving as to why you're disagreeing so much on parenting styles is in order? On both sides I mean.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are partners he needs to consider his wife as much as he considers what\u2019s the \u201ccorrect\u201d approach to responding to the baby when he wakes.", "He still cannot regulate his emotions. As a parent, it is your job to help him regulate his emotions until you can teach him to regulate his emotions. Your wife gets it, and I can't decide if you're cruel or lazy in your parenting.", "It sounds like the baby fusses and the mom immediately attends to him. Fussing doesn't always require swift action. \n\nAs an example, my nephew will be doing tummy time and starts fussing because his toy in on the other side of the mat. His parents let him get a little frustrated because he now has to problem solve. He starts scooting and pivoting, or he will grab the blanket and pull it toward him, bringing the toy with the blanket. Now he has the toy. Yes, his parent could have picked up the toy and placed it in front of him, and yes, the baby fussed for a few seconds. But then he figured out how to get his toy and everyone is now happy. \n\nMaybe it's generational? My parents always want to immediately just give the toy, but my sister tries to get them to relax and let the baby try to figure it out. He never cries out of frustration, just whines and fusses. But even that is too much for our parents lol", "How is 9 mo. old peak separation anxiety age?\n\nAnyhow you're twisting everything around and making judgments that OP is lying.\n\nDo you hate men that much?", "He regulates them fine. He eventually figures it out and is proud of himself. Babies need to learn. It kinda helps their emotional growth.", "It depends on the circumstance. First thing in the morning baby has a very wet diaper and is likely hungry and needs care that he can\u2019t figure out himself. Mom knows if baby will go back to sleep or sounds like he is awake for the day.", "I\u2019m married to a great man and have a son so no, I definitely don\u2019t hate men. Google the developmental ages of babies and you\u2019ll find that many start to have bad separation anxiety around 7\u201310 months.", "Not like that. Soothe your child, and as their ability to process language develops, you start talking them through their feelings. \"Oh, I know it must be really frustrating that you can't do x, but it's not ok to stomp your feet. Now, why don't we do some deep breaths together/color/get a glass of water and try again together, ok?\"\n\nObviously that's for a younger child, but you talk them through ways to calm down. At this age, you just comfort them.", "It checks out give or take.", "Yea hard no on your parenting advice. My kid walks and is starting to talk. He's determined, persistent and happy. He's doing just fine without treating him like he's stupid or touched in the head.", "Yeah, I'm calling bullshit. Babies might be trying to pull themselves up to stand at 9 months, but that's way too early to actually be properly walking. The average for a first word is 10-14 months, so he might be advanced with a lot of babbling and a few words, but you don't know shit about kids. No infant regulates their emotions, and you can't say a kid is whining about not knowing how to crawl (which they figure out between 7 and 12 months). At least do some googling before making a bs post.", "He literally did whine about not being able to crawl before he could. Did i say it happened yesterday? Lmao. And yea he walks fine. Little wobbly and still keeps one hand on things,  but he walks. sorry you didn't give your kid a chance to grow so they took longer with stuff."]}
