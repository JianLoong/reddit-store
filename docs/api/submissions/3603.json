If you don't want her to be your boss, stop helping her and if she wants help she needs to do it through email.", "NTA! \nYou need to let her figure out how to finish her own task, you\u2019re not getting paid to train her. Focus on your task, and if she keeps asking your for any help I would suggest to have everything in emails. For example if she calls you, goes over to your desk to ask for help on a certain task tell her \u201c can you please send that to me in a email, I\u2019m kind of busy right now but I\u2019ll read it and respond when I have time\u201d now you can start having paper trail. \nI would honestly have a conversation with my supervisor and HR, she\u2019s not fulfilling her  job duties, and needs constant supervision from you and Zoe.", "NTA\n\nShe got you in trouble. I would stay clear of her.", "NTA. Why are you giving this person the time of day after she threw you under the bus? Stop letting her use you. If she's not cut out for the job, she can either go back to her old position, or quit. It's not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nReport this to your immediate supervisor(s) and HR. Document everything.\n\nYou and Zoe have enough on your plate not to have to do Lily's job, too.", "NTA", "She's getting the same pay rate.", "NTA! I had a similar circumstance. She either has to sink or swim. She cannot expect to be carried. Doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s a good fit for the position and needs to be reevaluated to something more her speed.\n\nI am a big person in the workforce that believes in documentation and accountability. Sounds like you need to start copying your superior to show she\u2019s not an asset to the team and not pulling her weight. Be careful though. You want to be constructive, offer suggestions on helping her, but start indicating that Lily is not being a team player here.", "Yeah like that would have been my Que to tell manager all op just us but instead she rolled over and ate it .", "> I'm all for helping the team.\n\nLily is not.  In fact between complaining about your co-worker expecting her to do her own work and throwing you under the bus it actually seems like she is actively working against your team.  Lily is there for Lily, team be damned.  Start thinking of her as an internal risk rather than a misguided co-worker and do what you can to mitigate that risk and CYA until those in authority can see what her actual value is to the team.", "Your boss should have told her that she isn't worth as much as you are, and to get to your level of productivity first.\n\nNone of this is your fault, and you are being treated unfairly if she gets the same pay.\n\nNext time, when your boss says someone name dropped your salary on them.  Get mad and ask how they got that information.  That way they don't know it was you when you don't act surprised.", "That's between her and your boss. \n\nShe is using you, stop enabling her. You are going end up bitter and hating your job, as she gets the same perks as you without the work. Snaked like Lilly are common on the work office, they identify the weakest link in the office and step on them to get better things for themselves, after they finish, they would throw you under the bus.\n\n Ask yourself, does she feel guilty about putting your job in line to get herself a raise? Did she apologize for that? \n\nAs we say in my country: \"one thing is being nice, another, is being an idiot\"", "She is smart in protecting herself. But you should be smarter and protect yourself.   \nDecline all private meetings. Decline all requests for help unless in it in writings. Just because she wants things to \"stay between\" you, doesn't mean you have to oblige at all. She is only for herself with the maximum pay, you should care only for yourself, too, especially when it involves her.   \nIf she tries to guilt you for \"not supporting her\", just tell her, \"Oh, sorry, but I am very busy with my own works. But good luck! \"", "Refuse all meetings that aren't done through email or text or other recorded methods.  Say nothing when she comes in person, refuse to respond outside of written and recorded communication.  She's proven she will use and endanger your job this means she can not be trusted and those who can't be trusted to act in good faith have to live with the consequences of their decision.", "thank you for the award", "NTA, Lily is a rat", "NTA. Open your eyes. She's using you. Quit doing her work, and let her fail. She is used to getting ahead by stepping on people. She needs to sink or swim. She is no more overworked then you. She will throw you under the bus as soon as it helps her. Quit feeling guilty, do your own work, and make her do her own. She's manipulative, but u need to get smart, and ignore it. Start whining to her about being overworked, just not to anyone else.", "Forward or cc your boss on these emails. She sends you an email asking what to do? Cc her trainer or your boss and say \"Patching in Xxx to assist.\"", "OP=NTA\n\nif she can't do the job then she shouldn't have the job.\n\ndon't make more work for yourself.", "NTA. Its not personal, its business. Lily is being paid the same as you and Zoey, she should be producing the same amount and quality of work as you both are. If she is unable to, then she needs to step down to a position in which she is paid less to match her reduced expectations. Very simple.", "OP, this is a great question for the AskAManager blog.. But as a boss,, I would very much want to know this. You and Zoey need to inform.your boss that despite your best efforts to train Lily, she repeatedly asks for the same advice,  does not take good notes, complains about being overwhelmed,  and does not pull her full weight. Tell boss it's hurting your own work and that you can no longer continue to help Lily complete her regular duties.  If she continues to ask you to help,  forward all requests to your boss,.", "Quit helping her and learn CYA (cover your ass). She endangered your lively hood and didn't care. I would have got her demoted or fired right after that. You said that some tasks you are the only one that knows how to complete so that makes you more indispensable than her to the company. Ask for another raise or look into another job with higher pay and benefits.", "Send summary email and cc her supervisor. \u201cPer our conversation today at x time\u2026.\u201d", "This is where you document those meetings.  Take notes, summarize in an email and send it to her, with a cc to your boss.", "This!", "And whether or not it's legal, whether it would help other employees, I never discuss my salary to other employees. It almost always causes an issue because someone will think they are underpaid you are overpaid for whatever reason. It's not a company thing it's my personal boundary. I've been at bars after work with multiple employees and everyone to start saying what they make they come to me and I just say I don't discuss it. And they still give me a little bit of crap because now I know what they make but they don't know what I make, and I say well that's your issue I do not discuss my salary.", "Can you use an audio recorder for any meetings with her ? Some states it's not legal, but not all states ?", "NTA start responding \"the way X is explaining task is correct. Reach out to X if you have further questions.\" Make sure everything is written down.", "NTA Welcome to adulthood Lily. It's ghetto here.", "NTA, but you are enabling Lily.", "NTA but I think you should look for another job so you stop being overworked and underpaid.", "\u201cGender unspecified individual\u201d I love that \ud83d\ude02", "Actually, if it is Microsoft\u2019s PM, the IT team can pull the messages.", "> I was taught that it's bad form to discuss it, and you saw exactly why that is. \n\nI agree with everything but this. Discussing salary is only \"bad form\" because it can lead to companies having to increase wages to their employees as we saw here.  Now if a company has a policy against it then follow that policy, to avoid being fired.  But employees should be allowed to be open about what they are being paid.", "If she ambuses you in person and you answer a question, then I'd email her and say \"When you asked me XX today, I let you know that this kind of inquiry is regularly handled by me and Zoey for our clients, and it's my understanding that it would be within the scope of your duties.\"  cc: the boss.", "Yes, email comms only and for heaven's sake, one emoyee's salary is not another employee's business.  I cannot recall a single time that we shared salary information at any of my jobs.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but this next part is for Lily. Honey. Did you even read the job description? How did you do something so foolish as accept a job position you are not competent to perform?", "NTA It sounds an awful lot like Lily got accepted a position she's not qualified for. Direct her to the person training her when she has questions, and let her sink or swim on her own. If she can't hack it, she should be fire or quit.", "NTA.\nLily wanted equal pay. What did she expect to happen?", "so, she threw you under the bus and why are you still worrying about her.\n\nShe is paid to do her job and let her DO her job.  Learn how to step back and watch.  I am all for helping team members but clearly Lily does NOT deserve help from you.  She is just using you.  It is okay to say no and it won't make you look bad.  You even said that your boss wants to see her complete tasks by herself, then why are you standing in the way??  You gotta protect yourself first.  You are in for the money not doing charity work.", "NTA\n\nShe wanna be paid more than she needs to be able to do the work on her own. Do not allow her to\nUse you. I would\u2019ve cut her off after what she did.", "NTA. She doesn't seem to beable to grasp the job. At this point stop helping her. You're wasting your time on her. Tell her you have your own work and she should beable to do hers by now.", "NTA. There is a saying that fits Lily's \"situation\": shit or get off the pot. She asked to get this job. She nagged to have a raise in salary. Now she complains she is overwhelmed. It's nobody's blame but her's that she didn't do her homework and got informed about what the job entails prior to being promoted. If you can't do your job even after you got plenty of help then you should resign.", "Why are you setting yourself on fire to keep her warm?"]}
