I also would like to mention that Kate now works at a Zoo (important for later). \n\nMy family was very nice and welcoming to Kate. Everyone except Pam and May. My brother Ian and SIL May (both 30) are high school sweethearts and married after college. May has a little sister Pam (25F) and has always wanted us to date. She would joke about sisters marrying brothers and how she wish I would just ask Pam out. It was annoying but nothing extreme. I do want to make it clear that I told Pam I wasn\u2019t interested in her like that. Fine, right? Nope, when I first started dating Kate, Pam and Kay weren\u2019t happy and were often times rude to her. Kate always took the high road and treated them with respect. \n\nToday, my family (parents, Sister & BIL, Ian and May, and of course Pam) went to the zoo where my girlfriend works as they were holding a special event for their animal ambassadors. Before the team brought out the animals they went over the guidelines, no touching the animals, or trying to touch them, remain seated and quiet, normal things when live animals are coming out. Everything was running smoothly, Kate was glowing and I couldn\u2019t believe how happy I was to have found such an amazing woman. \n\nWell, time for the final animal and it\u2019s a ball python, one of my Kate\u2019s favorite ambassador animals. As she was talking she began walking around the room with the snake to give everyone a better view. As Kate walked past Pam, she decided to grab at the snake and yank. Of course, the snake didn\u2019t like that and ended up biting Kate and latching on while also beginning to squeeze her arm. Kate\u2019s boss was there and saw the entire thing go down, he immediately took Kate into another room to deal with the snake. \n\nI snapped, I stood up and started yelling at Pam. I told her she was a pathetic woman who couldn\u2019t handle the fact that I never wanted her. Pam was crying and begging me to stop being mean as we were soulmates. WTH.\n\nSecurity ended up coming into the room and told Pam she needed to leave the Zoo immediately. Now you\u2019re probably wondering about my family right? You would think they would be angry at Pam? Nope. They\u2019re pissed at me! My sister and BIL are the only ones on my side as my sister can\u2019t stand Kay and Pam, she finds them incredibly annoying and fake.\n\n My brother and parents are saying I was in the wrong for embarrassing Pam and that I needed to apologize. They said I could have pulled her aside and talked to her privately instead of yelling at her in front of a crowd, about 30-40 people. All of them say Kate shouldn\u2019t have left the room as she made it a bigger deal than it really was! WTH, Kate literally has puncture marks from the snake and a huge bruise on her arm from where the snake was squeezing. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Should I have pulled Pam aside instead of snapping in front of a crowd?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry I forgot to add this. When Pam grabbed the snake, she immediately began laughing  while stroking my arm. Only when I began yelling did she stop laughing.

(How much do I hope there was CCTV or someone filming the event?  A lot.)\n\nI would also suggest that you and Kate stick with your sister and BIL and Kate's family, and begin gathering a kind, considerate family of choice.

Once my son was vacuuming his room and brought Malcolm to me to not freak him out by the noise and vibration. Next thing I know, he hauled off and bit me in the fleshy part of my hand between my thumb and forefinger. Then wrapped around my arm! It didn\u2019t hurt but scared the dickens out of me.

A little sister to me is around 10 at the oldest and still capable of making foolish/stupid decisions thinking they are being funny.\n\nAdding to that the fact that her very childish stunt was extremely dangerous to both Kate and the snake! The snake could have bitten an artery, could have caused some tremendous amount of injury with the constriction.

I don't care if you publicly tore her down and humiliated her. She deserved it. While May was the main culprit, your brother and Pam are as much to blame for going along with it or feeding it to her.\n\nAnd I'd tell your parents straight.
