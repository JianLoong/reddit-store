I also would like to mention that Kate now works at a Zoo (important for later). \n\nMy family was very nice and welcoming to Kate. Everyone except Pam and May. My brother Ian and SIL May (both 30) are high school sweethearts and married after college. May has a little sister Pam (25F) and has always wanted us to date. She would joke about sisters marrying brothers and how she wish I would just ask Pam out. It was annoying but nothing extreme. I do want to make it clear that I told Pam I wasn\u2019t interested in her like that. Fine, right? Nope, when I first started dating Kate, Pam and Kay weren\u2019t happy and were often times rude to her. Kate always took the high road and treated them with respect. \n\nToday, my family (parents, Sister & BIL, Ian and May, and of course Pam) went to the zoo where my girlfriend works as they were holding a special event for their animal ambassadors. Before the team brought out the animals they went over the guidelines, no touching the animals, or trying to touch them, remain seated and quiet, normal things when live animals are coming out. Everything was running smoothly, Kate was glowing and I couldn\u2019t believe how happy I was to have found such an amazing woman. \n\nWell, time for the final animal and it\u2019s a ball python, one of my Kate\u2019s favorite ambassador animals. As she was talking she began walking around the room with the snake to give everyone a better view. As Kate walked past Pam, she decided to grab at the snake and yank. Of course, the snake didn\u2019t like that and ended up biting Kate and latching on while also beginning to squeeze her arm. Kate\u2019s boss was there and saw the entire thing go down, he immediately took Kate into another room to deal with the snake. \n\nI snapped, I stood up and started yelling at Pam. I told her she was a pathetic woman who couldn\u2019t handle the fact that I never wanted her. Pam was crying and begging me to stop being mean as we were soulmates. WTH.\n\nSecurity ended up coming into the room and told Pam she needed to leave the Zoo immediately. Now you\u2019re probably wondering about my family right? You would think they would be angry at Pam? Nope. They\u2019re pissed at me! My sister and BIL are the only ones on my side as my sister can\u2019t stand Kay and Pam, she finds them incredibly annoying and fake.\n\n My brother and parents are saying I was in the wrong for embarrassing Pam and that I needed to apologize. They said I could have pulled her aside and talked to her privately instead of yelling at her in front of a crowd, about 30-40 people. All of them say Kate shouldn\u2019t have left the room as she made it a bigger deal than it really was! WTH, Kate literally has puncture marks from the snake and a huge bruise on her arm from where the snake was squeezing. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Should I have pulled Pam aside instead of snapping in front of a crowd?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m sorry I forgot to add this. When Pam grabbed the snake, she immediately began laughing  while stroking my arm. Only when I began yelling did she stop laughing.

I don\u2019t know why!\u201d. Maybe make a public FB or IG post showing your GF\u2019s injury and how proud you are about how brave she is being.

No question about it, this could have turned out very badly, it seems that your family doesn't understand this. Avoid Pam and leave immediately if she appears from now on.", "NTA\n\nWhy, if I may ask, is Pam there in the first place? This is your brother\u2019s wife\u2019s sister.

I would personally take a step back from all of them so Kay can heal up and you two can enjoy the holidays without this bizarre drama. Your parents are acting like Pam was too young to know better or deserved consideration, but she was a) cruel to an animal, b) resulting in significant harm to Kay and potentially significantly stressing the snake and potentially endangering its health. But Pam is a grown ass woman and she for certain knew better. She just has no manners, no self control, and a high level of entitlement. EW.", "NTA.

If your parents are hell bent at not listening to the truth and want to continue the disrespect, then they can join the NC Club as well.

You nor Kate deserves this because of some sick, delusional fantasy someone else has.", "NTA. Your parents and brother are AHs. Pam is a dangerous lunatic. Charges should be filed.

We are NOT soulmates and I will now only feel disgust when I look at her. Lordly that was mental!", "Nta. This is only going to escalate though. They did that with the intention of hurting Kate.

When called out on the harassment, she doubled down with a delusion.\n\nPam needs serious mental health help. And you and Kate need to stay away from your family. They've shown they literally don't care about one of \"them\" hurting Kate. If you let them get away with this, the harm will be worse next time.", "Yikes! Sorry that happened. NTA. Please update us when you can", "NTA.  At all.  It's obvious that Pam was trying to hurt Kate. Don't apologize.", "NTA.\n\nPam is fucking unhinged.\n\nThink about it: What would push someone to grab and yank *a fucking snake* at a zoo, in front of a literal crowd of people?\n\nThat's some psychotic shit right there.\n\nZoo and Kate should annihilate Pam with some legal consequences, because clearly she didn't learn some critical basic notions of human decency and how to treat animals with basic care.", "INFO: I am confused.
