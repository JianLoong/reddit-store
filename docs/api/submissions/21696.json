Speeding through a residential area is worse.", "Seriously! I took it as that guy knew it would upset her and that\u2019s why he showed her. So yeah, fuck that guy! \n\nNTA OP", "Ice cream hack is chill though", "> Hard to fathom these are adults getting so excited about how to cheat a company out of ice cream!\n\nIt's IKEA, a multibillion dollar international corporation that is responsible for huge amounts of furniture waste and has killed children from neglect of it's product quality.\n\nLet's not pretend that this is Pop's from Riverdale or your local mom and pop diner, the accusation of shoplifting was not necessary. I think it's rich that wealthy people are trying to get a little off the top, but as I said, it's IKEA, they'll survive another day.", "Double in a residential? Dude deserved to lose his license imo a ticket was getting off easy", "Doing double the speed limit in a residential area means he probably deserved to be charged with dangerous driving. (Hit a pedestrian at 25 mph\u2014the speed limit in most residential areas\u2014and the odds of killing them are around 10%. Hit someone at 50 and the odds of killing them are 70%.", "I disagree on number two. The person got a ticket for going almost twice the speed limit in a residential area. His ticket was well deserved.", "The state I live in wrote a law limiting the amount of revenue a city can collect in speeding tickets because of one little town near where I live that the highway goes through that had a cop with a reputation for pulling people going as little as 1 over. We called him robocop. It was the only town in the entire state that would write more tickets per year than there were citizens living in the town, about 150% per year in number of tickets relative to the number of residents. I was one of them just last year when I was passing through lol (accelerated to pass a log truck, didn't want to be Final Destinationed lol)\nThat said, double the speed limit in a residential area is definitely deserved.", "Agree with ESH\n\nThe coworkers suck by the sounds, but surely you can't think the way you interact is going to make your working situation any easier", "> You're not the asshole for the last one, but you are for the first two.\n\nAs someone without a license and understands the other perspective I don't think she's the asshole for pointing it out. It's incredibly dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists and other traffic.\n\nI think AH is a bit harsh because her intentions were good but her phrasing was poor. Ultimately, speeding in residential areas happens because the urban planning around those areas is poor. Highway sized lanes encourage highway like speeds and it would probably help to have progressive fines for the Finance bros like Norway.", "I'm not super savvy but could you explain why it's misogynistic", "If he did not provide urgent medical help to the poor cat for a whole week, please report him to the SPCA. That's animal cruelty and abuse. The poor cat shouldn't be living in such conditions.", "I'm my area that's called stunt driving and the assholery comes with some pretty hefty consequences for a first offense:\n\n\u25cf jail time up to six (6) months;\n\u25cf (14) fourteen days immediate motor vehicle impoundment;\n\u25cf minimum fine \u2013 $2,000 and up to $10,000 plus 25% victim surcharge for the first time;\n\u25cf mandatory roadside licence suspension for thirty (30) days;\n\u25cf driver\u2019s licence suspension upon conviction: from 1 to 3 years;\n\u25cf mandatory driver improvement course\n\n\n[source](https://x-cops.ca/services/stunt-driving/#:~:text=Penalties%20for%20stunt%20driving%20first%20offence%20in%20Ontario%3A&text=minimum%20fine%20%E2%80%93%20%242%2C000%20and%20up,mandatory%20driver%20improvement%20course.)", "Really depends. There are some streets in my area which are steep downhill straight-shots but they're limited to 20-25 mph. It's easy to go twice over without even putting your foot on the gas. Plus, it's not really putting anyone in danger since you can see for a mile.", "Missed that part, edited it \ud83d\ude05", "I missed that part lol. Whoops! Thought it was just a minor speeding ticket. Edited!", "I didn\u2019t say anything about his ticket.", "You're right, asshole is a bit harsh for number 2. I don't think she should have really said anything, honestly, because it was clear he was venting, but, asshole is a bit harsh. Progressive fines would be incredible, honestly, because right now you just essentially pay a little bit of a fine to speed, if you're rich, and what does that matter when you make two million a year?", "I disagree with pretty much all of your points but maybe they are just badly explained.\n\nThe ice-cream isn't free, they're paying. IKEA expects wastage and sometimes people to take more. If their profit margin didn't allow for it, they wouldn't sell it. The price you're paying either covers the costs or its an intentional loss maker to drive other sales like meatballs or coke. Tiktok might narrow ice-cream profits, but its a furniture store. The restaurant is there so people can stay longer and buy more stuff rather than end their shop while hungry. They are a furniture business.\n\nTwo servings don't cause all costs to rise. They cause the ice-cream costs to rise slightly. Thing is, regardless of tiktok, or even if EVERYONE knew, most people still won't do this. When you say all our costs rise, that's really weird. Some people don't shop at IKEA. My costs certainly don't rise.", "I know you're being downvoted, but I agree with you. It has nothing to do with whether Ikea can afford it or not.", "Have you ever pondered how much it costs ikea to produce each piece of particleboard furniture which they then upsell by a ridiculous amount? I mean my entire house is filled with ikea furniture and I\u2019ve moved multiple times with ikea furniture. It is not meant to be taken apart I will tell you this. Stop dick riding corporations", "If it's a residential neighbourhood the problem is kids running into the street or popping out from between parked cars. And having grown up in a town with that's basically all hills, you the only question should be how much you let up on the brake.", "> but lots traffic tickets are largely exactly what he said and calling it voluntary tax contribution is bull.\n\n?????????????? Are you missing the context where you said this after you talked about how their shouldn't be NTA for all 3?", "No joke, these \"harmless\" stories are a way for amoral people to gauge how far someone else will go, or to see how curious someone is to try something. Putting your foot down right away like you're doing isn't fun for the story tellers because you're not playing the game. I say Meh, keep being you. Be the Debbie Downer, maybe you'll find yourself with coworkers who tell better quality stories.", "Please sir, can I have slightly more ice cream?", "It probably sounded interesting. People will watch shitty life hacks for 20 minutes about cleaning even though they are untidy and don't clean. Like you said, Dude was just probably trying to share something interesting and got shut down by OP.", "Use your grown up words."]}
