While we were there I excused myself to the bathroom and asked one of the girls to watch my bag for a moment to which she agreed.

We went about the night as normal and towards the end of the night the girls helped me search for the lipgloss as it is so sentimental to me. This one girl, \u201cHayley\u201d (fake name) was in a rush and telling us it was fine and we can look another day. I was a bit suspicious but just thought she was tried and brushed it off, it only took a few minutes before I noticed the cap of something sticking out of her bag and as she tilted a little more I could tell it was my lipgloss. I was enraged, here\u2019s how the conversation went.\n\nMe: Hayley. That lipgloss in your bag is identical to mine, could I look?\n\nH: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\n\nMe: no I need to see please.\n\nA few others intervened at this point, saying I was being pushy which I agree but I pressed until it slipped out. I grabbed it before she realised it was missing and then pointed out to the rest of the group that my name was engraved in the lipgloss and it was mine. Everyone was angry except one girl. I told Hayley I didn\u2019t want to be around such a disgusting thief and she was rude and wasn\u2019t trustworthy in the slightest. The others agreed and cut her off on the spot. One girl sided with Hayley and said we were petty and should have just let Hayley keep it. Hayley sent me a text that night to tell me that I embarrassed her and she was so upset. I just told her that she shouldn\u2019t have stole it from me knowing the sentimental value (they all do) and how she was selfish. I keep getting called an asshole by her friends AND MY SISTER??
