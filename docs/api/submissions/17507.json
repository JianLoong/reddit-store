The way he kept following you and insisting you give him change comes off as incredibly creepy. NTA", "NTA. \n\nShe has no idea if he's mentally disabled or not, but even if he is, mental disabilities aren't an excuse for every behavior under the sun. \n\nIf your girlfriend was so concerned with his wellbeing why didn't SHE give him something?", "NTA. After multiple calm \"No\"s, a freak out may make them remember you saying \"No\".", "NTA Situations like this, with strangers, are hard. Even harder when adding the layer of homelessness to the interaction. You were polite several times and he was being pushy.  Nobody likes loosing their cool with someone else, but in a situation like this it is understandable.", "NTA - It's a shame your GF missed the prior interactions where you were kind and polite! Asserting your boundaries does not make you an a h.", "NTA. You aren't able to give money at this time. That should be enough. The man continuing to bother you is harassment.", "NTA - Whether or not he was disabled does not change the fact that he was harassing you. He asked once which is fine, you said no politely which is fine, and that should have been the end. It became harassment when he came back, and you still chose to be polite, but that was not effective in ending the harassment so you had two options: Leave or step it up a notch. Maybe he came back because he has a mental problem, maybe he did it because he was desperate, maybe because he was rude. We will never know, but for this situation it doesn't matter because you already went the polite route and it wasn't enough to prevent harassment. His mental issues are not a reason you should risk your safety or already very tight budget. As you were busy at that location and with a friend that you couldn't leave, you really only had one option. It worked and he left you alone. Sometimes you do what you need to do.", "NTA and I think freaking out on the third time was entirely reasonable. A strange man is following you around a parking lot and even physically touching you, and he needs to be scared off because he is threatening your potential safety at this point.", "NTA.  Homeless men have actually been shown to target women because women, especially younger women, are easier to billy and intimidate.  You think he harassed and bullied a tall strong man as much as he did you?  No way, because that would require not being a bully and a coward.  Ignore him and threaten him with the cops next time, even if you don't mean it, it will get him to move on.", "NTA\n\nDid your girlfriend give him money?", "NTA", "NTA I was in a slightly similar situation as a family in 01' we'd had a big house fire. Blew the roof off the house ( just for scale )and then whilst living in a hotel room as a family we discovered the house had been broken into and anything we had left had been destroyed by vandals or taken. We were massively under insured and for a while it was uncertain if we'd ever get back to the house or how we'd manage. The insurance only covered a hotel room for the 5 of us due to my disability and the house being unlivable.  A begger kept following me and mum in town one day, constantly asking us to help the homeless and spare any change for the homeless and my mum just snapped. She was furious with the level of emotion it takes to make a shy retreating but very kind adult snap, help the homeless, and what the bloody hell do you think we are! \n It was one of those powered moments in my formative years. Like looking in the window of my own life.  If it wasn't for good family and friends life could have become much worse.  But people don't always see your situation unless you spell it out to them.  \nPs OP good luck with the freelance work and hope you land in your feet with a small safety net as soon as possible. Positive vibes man xx", "Not your finest moment, but also NTA.", "Did she ask you to drive over to the guy so SHE could be helpful and give him some money? \n\nNo?\n\nThen she should shut her whole entire face up.  \n\nNTA", "NTA but I'm sure you know that people like this exist and there's not much you can do about it. Ignore it and get away before things escalate. You don't need a reason not to give people money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
