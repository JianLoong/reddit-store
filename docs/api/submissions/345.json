I casually asked and he told me that it was the co-worker that he had been telling me that he made friends with at work. I knew about the coworker though I couldn\u2019t remember him telling me what the name of this co-worker was or that if I even asked.

I asked him when they started talking and he said he doesn\u2019t remember. I thought after scrolling a lot that I couldn\u2019t pinpoint when they did because there were just too many messages to load, so I just gave up and gave him his phone.

He fell in love with another girl and would have left you if she was interested. You deserve better.

You should not be interested in who your bf is texting, and not \"jokingly\" (but in expectancy ...) ask to look at his texts. How would you have reacted if he had say no ? It's a setup for drama. If your bf wants to bang the co-worker he will do it, and you'll likely never find out.\n\nYour bf is T.A because he can't handle your insecurities properly, and instead react in an aggressive way when he should be comforting, asking you what causes that insecurity, and work together on fixing them. Doing that, he just reinforces them.\n\nFinally, boundaries with friendship is a terrible thing. Partnerships is not possession. Your bf will simply grow frustration and in the long run your relationship will explode.\n\nHaving crushes on people is natural, you will experience it sooner or later too, and being able to talk about it and deal with it in a healthy way with our partners is the way to go. Not saying you have to allow side fun, but you have to allow a space for safe and open communication when the only thing this kind of decision allow is instead closing the space for communication.  \n\n\nYou both have to work about those insecurities and communication issues.
