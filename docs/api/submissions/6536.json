Got back home, doing my business and I received my brother's calling telling me that a motorcycle hit my mom while in the street. I just got dressed asap and headed to the hospital, but before my fiancee had already make lunch and served everything... I just told her that my mom had an accident and I was leaving, she told me to eat something first  I just said: \" I'm gonna see my mother\" and left.\n\nI got to the hospital and saw my mother's arm swollen as fuck, she was crying and I confronted the guy involved in the accident, he had insurance and well she got attended. And the time passed... she would have X-rays, analgesics and rest, thank God there weren't any fractures, so we got to my parent's home. We spent some time there and eat something until my mom fell asleep.\n\nSo when I was heading home this terrible feeling overwhelmed me that I could have lost my mother today... Got home with a quiet attituted and saw my wife watching a movie, she asked how everything went I told her that everything turned out great but with zero emotion, feeling almost lethargic. I sat next to her and she started to look at me worried and would ask me if everything is OK? I told her that I was just tired of the day and I wanted to sleep after running some chores, I instantly felt she got upset for me being that way... I carried on with the chores on the second floor and when I got to the first floor to lift something heavy she had already done it, I told her why would she do that in her condition and she told me: didn't you say you were exhausted? With an attitude of whatever... and I told her that that was my responsibility and she would say that she didn't understand why I would act with that kind of no emotion when I'm at home with her... and I felt like: am I not supposed to feel bad once in a while without you being offended? And I told her that I found her behavior selfish and left.\n\nNow here we are, she's mad and I'm better off after knowing my mother's stable. And I obviously have into consideration that she's pregnant and all the emotions that that state carries but I said what I said because I felt it that way.\n\nEDIT 1: Typos\nEDIT 2: Sorry, English is not my first language.", "created_utc": 1672885139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103mq2b/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_fiancee_shes_selfish/", "score": 899, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You completely failed to communicate with her, then got angry & insulting when she misunderstood. \n\nI don't find that any kind of fair. I am sorry your mother was in an accident, and I'm glad she's okay. It's still not fair tho, to fail to communicate & get angry because someone doesn't understand.

Your wife tried to ask if everything was ok, but you wouldn\u2019t talk to her.  You don\u2019t want to talk, fine.\n\nSo she left you alone.  You clearly didn\u2019t want to talk.  You said you were exhausted.\n\nShe gave you space and tried to let you rest, and you snapped at her for that, too.\n\nYes, you\u2019re allowed to feel bad once in a while.

You had a terrible day and were feeling pretty bad- that's all totally understandable. But when your partner noticed and checked in with you, instead of telling her the truth- that you were really shaken by your mother's accident- you lied and told her you were just tired. Then, when she took you at your word and tried to help you out by moving the heavy thing, you got mad. She can't read your mind! Lying, plus getting mad when she believed your lie and tried to help, makes you the AH.\n\nEdit: added a sentence", "YTA she was literally just trying to help you out after a stressful day and you clearly bottled up your emotions and let them blow up on her. Sure that was a scary situation but if you don't communicate to your partner how it made you feel you can't expect them to know how best to support you. She's pregnant with your child and your immaturity just put added stress on her and that's messed up.

Your mum got hurt and that\u2019s scary and horrible feeling. \n\nThen you blanked out and are looking for people to take that fear and scariness out on!\n\nEmotions are good.

You should've told her how you were feeling and how your mom was instead of just saying that you were tired. We all need to learn how to use our words. Even I mess up on that sometimes but you have to understand that your partner can not read your mind so you have to tell them what you are feeling. I think you guys should sit down, and have a conversation if the tone starts to become aggressive on either side, step away take a five-minute cool down, and get back to talking it out. \n\nBest of luck <3, also congrats on the baby!!!", "NAH.

This reminds me of that old book \u201cMen Are from Mars, Women are from Venus\u201d although the communication issues it describes may have more to do with individual differences nowadays than gender differences.  Traditionally, women were raised to discuss problems and feelings and men were raised to deal with them independently and without much discussion.  Although things have changed a lot since that book was written, your wife was probably trying to be supportive, and wanted you to tell her all about your traumatic afternoon, and you just wanted to relax, decompress, and think about something else. The argument that followed is based on this.  No AHs here.  I think this was just a miscommunication.", "NTA Jesus to those saying he is it's called trauma and he thought his mom was going to die.

Without knowing what y'all are like in day to day, I say NAH. You had an emotional day that left you drained. You heard your mom was in an accident and that got your adrenaline going. When you come down from that, you're so exhausted that even accepting comfort is energy you don't have. I view nothing wrong with wanting to finish up a few things to decompress and then sleep. I also view nothing wrong with your wife trying to help you get those things done faster.\n\nDid you feel she was giving you attitude? Yeah. Was she? Probably not. Should you have been snippy? No, but humans are full of faults. Sometimes we allow our emotions to get the best of us. I say that as long as this wasn't a typical thing, it's all good. Sleep, apologize to your wife, communicate that you were feeling the emotions of the day, and move on. But if you're regularly snapping at your wife, then you need to seek help with your emotions.", "NAH \n\nPregnancy is a wild rollercoaster of hormones and pains and stress. \n\nI'm guessing that she was upset that you couldn't spend much time with her, not that you left to go to see your mother or that you had \"no emotion\". The lack of excitement + attitude to see her added to the fact that you were gone all day and didn't seem to want to talk or do anything, probably hurt her feelings a bit. \n\nFrom someone who has been in her shoes, it's hard to stop yourself from being unnecessarily hurt and sensitive when your pregnant. Hormones will make you say and feel things you don't mean and don't understand. I wouldn't take it all to heart. I also would try to be a little more empathetic and treat her with a little extra care and respect during this time. She is dealing with a lot of change.", "Info: did your fianc\u00e9 ever call you or check in to see how your mom was? And/or was she upset when you didn\u2019t eat lunch?", "ESH. It sounds like emotions got the best of everyone. Apologize and move on.", "You're right, and believe me that that's how I felt 10 min after being alone, that's why I tried to reach her out but she was already mad. Appreciate the insight.", "YES. This is exactly the issue. Well said!", "I already did, and I understood that I was being a little bit unreasonable after 10 min. But everything is turning fine.", "Yeah ops grammar kinda gives me the vibes he might speak another language other than English so I think literally everything you mentioned is likely due to things getting slightly changed in translation. Even if not op didn\u2019t mention raising his voice once so idk about anger issues man", "I agree with being in shock after that... I know that thing to lift was urgent I was about to do it despite me feeling that way. I made the mistake of not communicating her that. Thanks for the insights.", "Thanks, I will keep that in mind more often.", "Yes I did, she knew what was going on all along... maybe you're right I just feel that me feeling that way wasn't validated by her", "I already apologized, we sorted thing out for the better and agreed on improving our communication issues, specially me.", "Thanks! And this is totally what I'm about to do, sit with her and calmly talk it out. I'm fine now, she's a little upset but I can make this work out.", "Okay listen no he didn't almost lose his mother. Her arm was damaged. Yes it was bad his mother got in an accident and I truly do feel bad for him, but you're coming off as sounding like OP's mom just recovered from her deathbed. If OP's mom went home the same day she got hit by the motorcycle then it wasn't even that bad of an injury. \n\nThe fact he didn't communicate with his partner but chose to lash out at her isn't fair or nice at all. You don't get a free pass for a day on being a jerk just because you had a family member get injured and now you're facing mortality and realizing just how fragile life is. I'm sorry. I lost my great grandmother who was like a mom to me, I needed people there for me. I didn't lash out at anyone I needed comfort. \n\nOP took his feelings and instead of doing the healthy thing took his frustrations out on his wife who was doing her job and actively being there and caring. It would have been selfish had she thrown a hissyfit over making lunch and he left anyway and then ate somewhere else. OP is TA because he could have leaned on his wife for support but turned away from her instead. Grieve in your own way yes, but don't alienate your loved ones.\n\nEdit: rereading OP's moms arm wasn't even fractured, she certaintly wasn't dying.", "EXACTLY!!!! I don't understand all the Y T A votes. We've all been in a chaotic situation that could've gone wrong, where our minds wonder about the what ifs. We are all aware of how our bodies react when we're in shock and then our bodies start to come down from the adrenaline and we are immediately exhausted and completely silent. I think he should have been given some leeway as well.", "I'm sorry, english is not my first language.", "Also, she *did* know something was wrong, but you wouldn\u2019t communicate. She listened to what you *would* say, about being tired, and she tried  to help you with the chores. But you got mad at that. Yes, she\u2019s hurt. She was shut out of the opportunity to be supportive, and when she tried to find a way to support, she was snapped at. That two betrayals of her kindness. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you have the same problem I see in a lot of men. Joy and Anger are the only two acceptable emotions. Anything else, they\u2019ve been taught, is a sign of weakness or failure or other unpleasantness you don\u2019t want to experience. So you ignore that those feelings exist. But the energy has to go somewhere. You aren\u2019t happy, so the only other option is mad. That\u2019s an emotion you understand and are comfortable feeling and showing\u2026. \n\nEven what you were *really* feeling was fear and love and the conflict of trying to being another human into the world when there are so many things you can\u2019t control or predict or stop or fix. You were thinking about your mom - the first love of your life - and your fianc\u00e9e and your baby - the greatest love of your life and how vulnerable they are and how vulnerable that makes you. And so the thought of your fianc\u00e9e taking on your task and harming herself or the baby was TOO FUCKING MUCH at that exact moment. \n\nSo tell her this. And make a genuine effort to talk to her about how you are feeling, when you are feeling it. She doesn\u2019t care if you have all the right words or if you get emotional. She\u2019d actually love that shit, if I and every single one of my friends are any indication. Be vulnerable with her because a) it is the only way to grow closer, b) you need (and deserve!!) the support, and c) who the hell else are you going to tell?  And don\u2019t fuck this up when it takes such little effort and the pay off is so big.", "As someone that used to say I'm tired when I didn't want to talk about my emotions or couldn't figure out what I was feeling.  May I suggest saying I need time to work out how I'm feeling or I don't have the energy to talk about how I am at the minute I just need some time (follow this up with a show of affection you feel comfortable with to lessen to chance of the person feeling rejected). \n\nI've had many missed moments of connection and communication like you've described because I said I'm tired but using the above has improved my relationship greatly.\n\nEdit spelling.", "Just talk to her now and apologize.

These are pretty toxic sayings. \n\nBe a little kinder to yourself. Give yourself a break. Don\u2019t engage when you are emotional. Rather say to your partner something like \u201cI\u2019m kinda feeling overwhelmed at the minute, I need some time to decompress and think before I speak\u201d.

That\u2019s what happened, you were emotionally drained and processing it all and probably scared by almost loosing your mom. It\u2019s completely understandable that you didn\u2019t have the motivation to talk about it. Communication especially about feelings to your partner is important no doubt but you shouldn\u2019t feel pressured to do so at once. I\u2019m sure when you were in the right state of mind you would have told her more. You weren\u2019t being an asshole just because you weren\u2019t emotionally available at that moment, you seemed to be in shock. When we go through a traumatic event or a loved one does it\u2019s very natural to go about things robotically. That\u2019s called being shocked and unable to cope. If she hadn\u2019t taken it personally and understood that you were overwhelmed and that maybe the next day or the day after you would be a little better especially after meeting your mom again and if she\u2019s completely stable. You could have a proper conversation about what you know about the accident and how you were scared to loose her. To all those saying communication was missing, it doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand that when a person is in such a situation you need to treat them with a little care and see if it\u2019s better to let them adjust instead of pestering them or if you should comfort them without them asking. As their partner you would know what kind of a person they are and if they like to sort out their emotions and then talk to you or what. Personally I think this was handled poorly on both sides as in partner should have asked for updates or gone with you or you should have kept her in the loop the entire time so she could know what headspace you were in before you reached home. I can imagine it was also a hard day for her to be concerned about you. But I also understand that you don\u2019t think very rationally in such situations like I understand if your first thought after getting updates is to not update your partner but to just process it. I would recommend explaining to her just how you were feeling and why you acted like that. Because remedies need to be made to fix the situation but I don\u2019t think either of you were in the wrong even if your partner could have been more supportive. Anyways you are not the asshole and others who say so really don\u2019t understand how traumatic such things can be. Ofc trauma is no reason to be excused for bad behaviour but this wasn\u2019t it.

Be prepared to also listen to her side and why she is angry -- she is going to be much more open to hearing and understanding your feelings if you are validating hers as well. EDIT for clarity: Just like you have every right to feel bad once in awhile, she has every right to be upset too.\n\nThis is the type of fight my wife and I have the most often: one of us is upset, the other tries to help but just makes it worse, both people feel bad.

She tried to make sure he was fed before he went, probably knowing he would be stuck there a while with no real food. No part of that read like she expected him to be in a good mood. He's the one that came in and said that everything is great! What the hell is she supposed to do with that? He communicated that he's tired, so she helped with his chores. That's all he communicated to her though. The rest is on him.", "You are surprised that a wife cares more about her husbands wellbeing than her MIL? Really?", "Yeah, how he's feeling is understandable but his partner didn't do anything wrong. She:\n\n1) asked if he was ok. Totally normal thing to ask when someone doesn't look great/ you know something bad has happened.\n\n2) heard him say he was tired, so did some chores to help out. \n\nHe then got upset with her for perceived slights (he assumed she was upset with him, assumed she had an attitude). Her response wasn't great either, but there was no reason for him to behave like that to her. \n\nOP didn't mean to be an AH, it's understandable given what he just went through, but he was still an AH to his partner.", "Please please do not listen to anyone saying YTA, there\u2019s is no fucking way that is the case, me and my partner both read your post and agree you are not even close to being an asshole here. You gotta understand people\u2019s egos push them toward whatever answer makes them feel most important. That is what is happening here. No therapist would ever say you were being angry to your partner in that post or taking out your emotions on your partner, in fact you were not even able to express your emotions due to the shock, something I have experienced first hand when my mom died and then when my dad was put in the hospital on the same day.

Same with \u201cI told her\u201d vs \u201cI asked her\u201d. Maybe OP is from a culture where referring to a fianc\u00e9e as \u201cmy girl\u201d is seen as affectionate rather than possessive- there are lots of possibilities and I\u2019m hesitant to assume that someone who doesn\u2019t speak English as a first language is a controlling asshole because of a small phrase they used. \n\nTo me this whole post/the interaction between OP and his fianc\u00e9e comes across as two people having some miscommunications during a very emotional day, which is totally normal and not a sign that either of them is controlling, patronizing, or unreasonable. If I had just spent the day at the hospital with my injured parent, I\u2019d be pretty exhausted when I got home and probably wouldn\u2019t have a very expressive vocal tone or be able to fully show and explain my emotions right away. I\u2019m not saying that OP or anyone else has free range to act however they want after a stressful day, but nowhere in the post does it indicate that OP was yelling or taking his stress out on his fianc\u00e9e.

It seems like OP was very aware that, in the moment, he wasn\u2019t in the mood or headspace to have a big discussion about things. He explained that he was tired and just wanted to get to sleep, which makes sense after spending the day in the hospital with an injured parent who was in a scary accident.

If OP hadn\u2019t expressed that to his fianc\u00e9e or had gotten into a deep conversation when he knew he wasn\u2019t in the best headspace to do so, I feel like that would be a bigger sign of emotional immaturity/anger issues than what he did.", "But according to yr post, u didn\u2019t say that, you said you were just tired; she doesn\u2019t know your upset :/ this poor woman", "What I meant was that that was what I did later, after sorting myself out", "Thank you for the insight, an eye opener for me.

Check yourself.", "NAH. You had a energy crash after going through an adrenaline surge reacting to your mother\u2019s accident. It is a natural fight or flight response to emergencies and the exhaustion and emotional numbness is common.

You have a baby on the way, and you are likely thinking about the impact a loss of your mother would have for you all and possibly even what could happen if you, or she had been lost in an accident. That is a lot to process and you can apologize for being preoccupied with it but ultimately, she needs to understand that this is part of partnership and parenthood.

She tried to take care of a difficult chore for you because you expressed that you were exhausted and you perceived attitude in her response. I personally think NAH as this seems like a series of miscommunications from the way everything is explained. Your partner didn\u2019t seem to really have a clue as to what you went through, outside of \u201cmom was in an accident\u201d and \u201cmom is okay, I\u2019m okay, but I\u2019m exhausted,\u201d and you seem to have been in a sensitive state after a long and grueling day where her possibly blas\u00e9 attitude toward you and the emergency may have come across as more aggressive than she meant it. I don\u2019t think anyone really did anything wrong here, considering the circumstances. I think if you guys just take a big deep breath and have a clear talk you\u2019ll be able to get on the same page.\n\nI will say, this post doesn\u2019t paint your communication in the best light in general. It seems like you\u2019re a habitual Stone waller when you\u2019re stressed/upset and that she doesn\u2019t know how to support you in those moments due to that lack of communication and connection. I know from my personal experience that it can be very hard to separate myself from my partners upset attitude if they\u2019re unwilling to confide in me and push me away, resulting in me feeling as though I did something or am being punished in some way. I struggle with childhood trauma and mental health issues, so I know that\u2019s not the case for most people, but it may help in understanding why you \u201ccan\u2019t feel bad without her being offended\u201d. It doesn\u2019t seem like she takes offense to you being upset, but is offended by how unwilling you are to express emotion around her or to confide in her. That would make it difficult for me to feel like my partner trusts me, so I\u2019m imagining that your fianc\u00e9e may be feeling something similar. The reasoning behind your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s anger with you seems to be something that extends far beyond this one scenario and has been building in my opinion. \n\nIn the end, I\u2019m just a random stranger who doesn\u2019t know the details so I know I could easily be wrong, but this is the vibe I got. \n\nGoing to reiterate my judgement as NAH. Miscommunications happen during strenuous times when everyone\u2019s emotions are elevated and your heart is feeling raw from stress and shock. I hope the best for you both and hope that it IS just a miscommunication. Congrats on the baby!", "This is one of the reasons why male suicide is so high.

You came home, looking rather down and exhausted, but said \"everything turned out great\" and left it like that. There's a discrepancy between your verbal language and your body language, so your fiancee must've been confused.\n2. Fianc\u00e9e tries to figure out what's going on (probably in order to learn how to behave - to help, give you space, listen to your thoughts - whatever you need) and asks again how you feel. Instead of telling her what's on your mind, you blamed it on being tired.\n3. Fianc\u00e9e probably sensed that this isn't all there is to it, but what can she do if she does want to respect your boundaries? Clearly you don't want to talk. You leave the room for upstairs chores and fianc\u00e9e thinks the only way to help you now is to help with your chores so you can go to bed fast (since you said you're tired and want to sleep after finishing chores).

You take it as being not allowed to be sad, get mad and blame her for being selfish.\n6. Fianc\u00e9e is confused, feels wronged, excluded and misunderstood and is mad now - rightfully so.\n\nI get that this was an emotional event for you, but you need to work on your communication skills, really.

Absolutely wild.", "Only a heartless beast of a human being would not allow a person who so obviously was stunned, shocked, and upset by a traumatic incident time to process and to give them comfort. \n\nThis woman showed her true colors, I would advise the OP to insist on counseling only because there is a baby coming.  \n\nOtherwise, I would suggest ending the relationship.  This woman cannot be trusted to be an understanding, compassionate partner.", "No, the argument ensued because she was giving him attitude since the moment he got back home.\n\nShe has no empathy, compassion, nor kindness for the traumatic event.\n\nHe was in shock while she ate her meal and did not even offer to accompany him to the hospital.", "That is good news! I'm glad she is doing well.", "I'm glad he is doing good. \ud83d\ude0a", "And I think it\u2019s wild that you feel it\u2019s ok for him to get mad at his girlfriend for doing a chore. Look! We\u2019re all entitled to our opinions! That\u2019s the beauty of this world.\n\nBy the way, recommendations for lifting while pregnant are based on stage of pregnancy, individual strength, and frequency of lifting amongst other things. She\u2019s four months/16 weeks, which is early in the pregnancy with fewer recommended restrictions. Since the OP gives no information about what she was lifting other than \u201cit\u2019s heavy\u201d (which is incredibly subjective) we really have no idea if she should or shouldn\u2019t be lifting it. Since OP presented it as if they were doing pretty normal house chores, I\u2019m taking a stab in the dark that she wasn\u2019t lifting the refrigerator. Even if she moved a chair or coffee table to vacuum (which would likely be pushing and *not* lifting) she\u2019s probably OK. My whole point was, while it\u2019s totally understandable that OP was in a tough mental spot, he also seems to be projecting a bit of that on to his girlfriend, which isn\u2019t fair.", "That is horrible logic lmao. If you assume something that makes someone GUILTY of something, THAT'S when you need to prove it. Do you walk around and just get hyper paranoid about literally everyone you pass because they could stab you or shoot you? No, you don't (and if you do, seek help) because you assume the people you pass are reasonable and nonhostile unless they give you a reason to be suspicious. The OP doesn't give any indication of anger issues in this post.", "I read it as op had a \u201cquiet attitude\u201d himself. The first mention I see of his wife being upset is op\u2019s perception of her reaction to him saying he\u2019s okay when he clearly wasn\u2019t. That could be a lot of things. It could be concern, frustration that he is saying he\u2019s fine when he\u2019s not, op could have misjudged. \n\nWe also do not know everything about the interaction before he left. All op says is paraphrased, my mother was in an accident and I\u2019m going to see her. No mention of the hospital urgency, injuries, etc. Maybe she offered to go and he declined, maybe she had to stay home for other reasons not mentioned. OP didn\u2019t say anything about being bothered by that so why assume she did wrong there? Maybe she was texting op all day being updated on the situation. Maybe she was texting op and he didn\u2019t have time to answer so she is left in the dark all day as to what is going on and how everyone is doing. \n\nAll we know is that OP was in a weird space for a very legitimate reason. He didn\u2019t communicate properly with his fianc\u00e9, then lashed out when she did something he didn\u2019t like. He\u2019s wrong to have done that and needs to apologize. She she immediately understand and accept the apology because of the circumstances.", "She was giving him attitude by watching TV, asking about his mom and being worried for him?", " The OP states he \"got home with a quiet attitude\"....................\" with zero emotion, feeling almost lethargic.\"  \n\nThe OP \" instantly felt she got upset for me being that way\" meaning she took his being \"emotionless and lethargic\" due to being in shock as a personal offense.\n\nThe OP then stated he \"continued on with doing the chores despite feeling exhausted.\" When the OP asked why she did some heavy lifting,  She responded \"didn't you say you were exhausted?\" \"With an attitude of whatever...\"  When he asked why. She said that \"she didn't understand why I would act with that kind of no emotion when I'm at home with her\" as though he was not entitled to have his own feelings and emotions about his Mother's accident.  Reeeeeaaally?\n\nYou assume the best of his girlfriend and I do not.  \n\nBased on what I read she is selfish, self-absorbed, and unkind.", "He did not say she had an attitude while watching TV or asking about him and as for being worried about him.  \n\nI think what she was worried about was that his attention was not solely directed her. \n\nShe developed attitude because \"she didn't understand why I would act with that kind of no emotion when I'm at home with her\".  In other words, his demeanor of sadness, blankness, shock upset her because it was not because of her. \n\nThe attitude came because he was emotionless and lethargic when answering her questions. \n\nGood God........................................"]}
