Got back home, doing my business and I received my brother's calling telling me that a motorcycle hit my mom while in the street. I just got dressed asap and headed to the hospital, but before my fiancee had already make lunch and served everything... I just told her that my mom had an accident and I was leaving, she told me to eat something first  I just said: \" I'm gonna see my mother\" and left.\n\nI got to the hospital and saw my mother's arm swollen as fuck, she was crying and I confronted the guy involved in the accident, he had insurance and well she got attended. And the time passed... she would have X-rays, analgesics and rest, thank God there weren't any fractures, so we got to my parent's home. We spent some time there and eat something until my mom fell asleep.\n\nSo when I was heading home this terrible feeling overwhelmed me that I could have lost my mother today... Got home with a quiet attituted and saw my wife watching a movie, she asked how everything went I told her that everything turned out great but with zero emotion, feeling almost lethargic. I sat next to her and she started to look at me worried and would ask me if everything is OK? I told her that I was just tired of the day and I wanted to sleep after running some chores, I instantly felt she got upset for me being that way... I carried on with the chores on the second floor and when I got to the first floor to lift something heavy she had already done it, I told her why would she do that in her condition and she told me: didn't you say you were exhausted? With an attitude of whatever... and I told her that that was my responsibility and she would say that she didn't understand why I would act with that kind of no emotion when I'm at home with her... and I felt like: am I not supposed to feel bad once in a while without you being offended? And I told her that I found her behavior selfish and left.\n\nNow here we are, she's mad and I'm better off after knowing my mother's stable. And I obviously have into consideration that she's pregnant and all the emotions that that state carries but I said what I said because I felt it that way.\n\nEDIT 1: Typos\nEDIT 2: Sorry, English is not my first language.", "created_utc": 1672885139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103mq2b/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_fiancee_shes_selfish/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You completely failed to communicate with her, then got angry & insulting when she misunderstood. \n\nI don't find that any kind of fair. I am sorry your mother was in an accident, and I'm glad she's okay. It's still not fair tho, to fail to communicate & get angry because someone doesn't understand. That's setting them, and your relationship up for failure.", "YTA\n\nAll you told her was \u201cmy mom had an accident.

Your wife tried to ask if everything was ok, but you wouldn\u2019t talk to her.  You don\u2019t want to talk, fine.\n\nSo she left you alone.  You clearly didn\u2019t want to talk.  You said you were exhausted.\n\nShe gave you space and tried to let you rest, and you snapped at her for that, too.\n\nYes, you\u2019re allowed to feel bad once in a while.  You\u2019re *not* allowed to take it out on her, or expect her to read your mind and know exactly how you want to be treated when you are in a bad mood.", "YTA. You had a terrible day and were feeling pretty bad- that's all totally understandable. But when your partner noticed and checked in with you, instead of telling her the truth- that you were really shaken by your mother's accident- you lied and told her you were just tired. Then, when she took you at your word and tried to help you out by moving the heavy thing, you got mad. She can't read your mind! Lying, plus getting mad when she believed your lie and tried to help, makes you the AH.\n\nEdit: added a sentence", "YTA she was literally just trying to help you out after a stressful day and you clearly bottled up your emotions and let them blow up on her. Sure that was a scary situation but if you don't communicate to your partner how it made you feel you can't expect them to know how best to support you. She's pregnant with your child and your immaturity just put added stress on her and that's messed up.

Your mum got hurt and that\u2019s scary and horrible feeling. \n\nThen you blanked out and are looking for people to take that fear and scariness out on!\n\nEmotions are good.

You should've told her how you were feeling and how your mom was instead of just saying that you were tired. We all need to learn how to use our words. Even I mess up on that sometimes but you have to understand that your partner can not read your mind so you have to tell them what you are feeling. I think you guys should sit down, and have a conversation if the tone starts to become aggressive on either side, step away take a five-minute cool down, and get back to talking it out. \n\nBest of luck <3, also congrats on the baby!!!", "NAH.

This reminds me of that old book \u201cMen Are from Mars, Women are from Venus\u201d although the communication issues it describes may have more to do with individual differences nowadays than gender differences.  Traditionally, women were raised to discuss problems and feelings and men were raised to deal with them independently and without much discussion.  Although things have changed a lot since that book was written, your wife was probably trying to be supportive, and wanted you to tell her all about your traumatic afternoon, and you just wanted to relax, decompress, and think about something else. The argument that followed is based on this.  No AHs here.  I think this was just a miscommunication.", "NTA Jesus to those saying he is it's called trauma and he thought his mom was going to die.

It was traumatic and truly could have been worse.

Without knowing what y'all are like in day to day, I say NAH. You had an emotional day that left you drained. You heard your mom was in an accident and that got your adrenaline going. When you come down from that, you're so exhausted that even accepting comfort is energy you don't have. I view nothing wrong with wanting to finish up a few things to decompress and then sleep. I also view nothing wrong with your wife trying to help you get those things done faster.\n\nDid you feel she was giving you attitude? Yeah. Was she? Probably not. Should you have been snippy? No, but humans are full of faults. Sometimes we allow our emotions to get the best of us. I say that as long as this wasn't a typical thing, it's all good. Sleep, apologize to your wife, communicate that you were feeling the emotions of the day, and move on. But if you're regularly snapping at your wife, then you need to seek help with your emotions.", "NAH \n\nPregnancy is a wild rollercoaster of hormones and pains and stress. \n\nI'm guessing that she was upset that you couldn't spend much time with her, not that you left to go to see your mother or that you had \"no emotion\". The lack of excitement + attitude to see her added to the fact that you were gone all day and didn't seem to want to talk or do anything, probably hurt her feelings a bit. \n\nFrom someone who has been in her shoes, it's hard to stop yourself from being unnecessarily hurt and sensitive when your pregnant. Hormones will make you say and feel things you don't mean and don't understand. I wouldn't take it all to heart. I also would try to be a little more empathetic and treat her with a little extra care and respect during this time. She is dealing with a lot of change.", "Info: did your fianc\u00e9 ever call you or check in to see how your mom was? And/or was she upset when you didn\u2019t eat lunch?", "ESH. It sounds like emotions got the best of everyone. Apologize and move on.", "You're right, and believe me that that's how I felt 10 min after being alone, that's why I tried to reach her out but she was already mad. Appreciate the insight.", "YES. This is exactly the issue. Well said!", "I already did, and I understood that I was being a little bit unreasonable after 10 min. But everything is turning fine.", "Yeah ops grammar kinda gives me the vibes he might speak another language other than English so I think literally everything you mentioned is likely due to things getting slightly changed in translation. Even if not op didn\u2019t mention raising his voice once so idk about anger issues man", "I agree with being in shock after that... I know that thing to lift was urgent I was about to do it despite me feeling that way. I made the mistake of not communicating her that. Thanks for the insights.", "Thanks, I will keep that in mind more often.", "Yes I did, she knew what was going on all along... maybe you're right I just feel that me feeling that way wasn't validated by her", "I already apologized, we sorted thing out for the better and agreed on improving our communication issues, specially me.", "Thanks! And this is totally what I'm about to do, sit with her and calmly talk it out. I'm fine now, she's a little upset but I can make this work out.", "Okay listen no he didn't almost lose his mother. Her arm was damaged. Yes it was bad his mother got in an accident and I truly do feel bad for him, but you're coming off as sounding like OP's mom just recovered from her deathbed. If OP's mom went home the same day she got hit by the motorcycle then it wasn't even that bad of an injury. \n\nThe fact he didn't communicate with his partner but chose to lash out at her isn't fair or nice at all. You don't get a free pass for a day on being a jerk just because you had a family member get injured and now you're facing mortality and realizing just how fragile life is. I'm sorry. I lost my great grandmother who was like a mom to me, I needed people there for me. I didn't lash out at anyone I needed comfort. \n\nOP took his feelings and instead of doing the healthy thing took his frustrations out on his wife who was doing her job and actively being there and caring. It would have been selfish had she thrown a hissyfit over making lunch and he left anyway and then ate somewhere else. OP is TA because he could have leaned on his wife for support but turned away from her instead. Grieve in your own way yes, but don't alienate your loved ones.\n\nEdit: rereading OP's moms arm wasn't even fractured, she certaintly wasn't dying.", "EXACTLY!!!! I don't understand all the Y T A votes. We've all been in a chaotic situation that could've gone wrong, where our minds wonder about the what ifs. We are all aware of how our bodies react when we're in shock and then our bodies start to come down from the adrenaline and we are immediately exhausted and completely silent. I think he should have been given some leeway as well.", "I'm sorry, english is not my first language.", "Also, she *did* know something was wrong, but you wouldn\u2019t communicate. She listened to what you *would* say, about being tired, and she tried  to help you with the chores. But you got mad at that. Yes, she\u2019s hurt. She was shut out of the opportunity to be supportive, and when she tried to find a way to support, she was snapped at. That two betrayals of her kindness. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I think you have the same problem I see in a lot of men. Joy and Anger are the only two acceptable emotions. Anything else, they\u2019ve been taught, is a sign of weakness or failure or other unpleasantness you don\u2019t want to experience. So you ignore that those feelings exist. But the energy has to go somewhere. You aren\u2019t happy, so the only other option is mad. That\u2019s an emotion you understand and are comfortable feeling and showing\u2026. \n\nEven what you were *really* feeling was fear and love and the conflict of trying to being another human into the world when there are so many things you can\u2019t control or predict or stop or fix. You were thinking about your mom - the first love of your life - and your fianc\u00e9e and your baby - the greatest love of your life and how vulnerable they are and how vulnerable that makes you. And so the thought of your fianc\u00e9e taking on your task and harming herself or the baby was TOO FUCKING MUCH at that exact moment. \n\nSo tell her this. And make a genuine effort to talk to her about how you are feeling, when you are feeling it. She doesn\u2019t care if you have all the right words or if you get emotional. She\u2019d actually love that shit, if I and every single one of my friends are any indication. Be vulnerable with her because a) it is the only way to grow closer, b) you need (and deserve!!) the support, and c) who the hell else are you going to tell?  And don\u2019t fuck this up when it takes such little effort and the pay off is so big.", "As someone that used to say I'm tired when I didn't want to talk about my emotions or couldn't figure out what I was feeling.  May I suggest saying I need time to work out how I'm feeling or I don't have the energy to talk about how I am at the minute I just need some time (follow this up with a show of affection you feel comfortable with to lessen to chance of the person feeling rejected). \n\nI've 5 many missed moments of connection and communication like you've described because I said I'm tired but using the above has improved my relationship greatly.", "Just talk to her now and apologize.

These are pretty toxic sayings. \n\nBe a little kinder to yourself. Give yourself a break. Don\u2019t engage when you are emotional. Rather say to your partner something like \u201cI\u2019m kinda feeling overwhelmed at the minute, I need some time to decompress and think before I speak\u201d.
