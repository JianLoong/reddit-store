I really did not want a public proposal\n\nHe said something along the lines of \u201cbefore we get something to eat, I want to ask you something first\u201d and got down on one knee in the middle of the busy walk way with everyone passing by and looking at us, and asked if I would marry him. He didn\u2019t say anything like you make me happy, I want to spend the rest\nof my life with you, etc. \n\nI had a feeling that morning he was going to propose and I was getting nervous because I was like \u201chow is he going to propose to me here with all these people around? He knows I don\u2019t want to be proposed to in public.\u201d I said it to him at least 5 times in passing discussions when we would talk about getting married. I am somewhat shy and I knew being in public would make it hard for me to enjoy the moment. And it did\n\nI looked at him and quickly said yes because he was in the way of a ton of people walking by and I wanted everyone to stop looking at us. Afterwards I was just like \u201cso do you still want to go eat?\u201d And he said \u201cwell that was anti-climactic.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say because I was excited to be engaged because I do love him so much and have no doubts about marrying him but I was also hurt he proposed in public when I asked him not to and then said to me \u201cthat was anticlimactic\u201d because he explained later he thought I would cry, be more emotional, etc.\n\nI definitely think I would have cried and been more emotional had he done it more intimately! I literally would have been fine and happy with him doing it in our home with some nice heartfelt words and then like a reservation to dinner later that night somewhere local. I don\u2019t ask for a lot. I just didn\u2019t want it in public because I knew I\u2019d feel uncomfortable. \n\nAnd then we just walked around the market like it was any other day after and it was kind of strange! Haha. And we got food to go and ate it at home, watched tv, and went to bed. There was no dinner reservation or like any sort of something special planned after the proposal to be able to celebrate together. \n\nAgain, I love him. No doubt about that or marrying him. And I get why he proposed there (it\u2019s somewhere we go every Valentine\u2019s Day) but I am really hurt that he did it in public when I didn\u2019t want him to. And I did bring it up to him jokingly in another discussion one time and he said \u201cwell you can\u2019t pick how you\u2019re proposed to\u201d and that\u2019s hurtful too. Also that he was upset with me that I didn\u2019t cry/that it was anticlimactic so it made me feel guilty like I didn\u2019t respond the \u201cright way\u201d and disappointed him.\n\nI keep telling myself it\u2019s fine and whatever. The marriage is more important than a proposal. But I keep thinking back to it every now and then and I get really sad.

You mentioned it to him in conversation that you don\u2019t want a public proposal. The compromise should have been to take you to a semi-public place, like a quiet park, or booked a quick get away for the two of you\u2026\n\nThe proposal was done selfishly. I would try having a serious conversation about this because anyone who dismisses your wants and needs whilst dating, will continue to do it further down the line if there\u2019s been no effort to improve in the future.\n\nHe is the Asshole, not you.\n\nEdit: because some of you clowns are getting worked up because I used weaponised incompetence, it says a lot you will focus on that and not the issue at hand. Keep crying about it. Weaponised incompetence doesn\u2019t only apply to domestic chores but other scenarios too; meaning he was aware and yet refused to apply the knowledge to find a solution that would make them both happy.

Wil this be a trend?", "NTA tell him you are both disappointed at how the proposal went. What was his intention of asking you in an extremely crowded public place ? What was he trying to achieve by hoping you would get emotional & cry in front of a crowd of strangers? Was he wanting you make a spectacle of yourself?

He chose to disregard your wishes (which you said you stated at least 5 different times) and yet, he did it anyway.\n\nAs much as you love him, I would be thinking carefully about this, as THIS is the way he will continue to be -- disregarding what you want/feel/say and doing what HE wants. \n\nLastly, as someone else pointed out, this was highly manipulative. He counted on you feeling flustered/embarrassed to cause you to just answer to get it over with.

There is no shame in letting him know that you would have loved to have given him the tears and the emotions but you were embarrassed as you don't like those things in public. \n\nTell him you would have loved a quiet, romantic place just the two of you and you wish you understood why he decided to do it in public surrounded by strangers.\n\n If you love him as much as you say you do and as much as you say he does then just talk it out.

He should know he didn\u2019t meet what you thought was a clear expectation of a private proposal. The flowery words I\u2019d leave out because he needs to say what feels natural to him. It\u2019s also fair to know what created the circumstances surrounding his proposal. \n\nYou knew it was coming that day, but it also reads unprepared like he did it impulsively or before he lost his nerve?  \n\nRight now both of you are disappointed.

At that point I would have probably said, I'm thrilled but a little uncomfortable to be doing this in public, can we get out of here and celebrate privately?  It's sweet that the location has meaning but it's odd that he proposed in public knowing that you didn't want this; unless he wasn't paying attention to your dropped hints.  It's possible that he just thought the sentimentality of the location would outweigh your aversion to a public proposal, but unfortunately it's also possible that it was a bit of a passive aggressive power play.  Only you know him well enough to make the call on this.  Bottom line, the proposal can't be changed. You both were a little disappointed by the outcome.  Maybe the best thing to do at this point is to schedule a private romantic dinner to celebrate the proposal properly.", "Probably NAH\u2026but I think it\u2019s interesting that you both had different expectations for each other. You wanted him to propose privately and he wanted you to get emotional. I don\u2019t know if that means anything but it\u2019s curious to me.

You told him before what you wanted and not only did he not listen, he acted like your feelings on the situation didn't matter, whether or not you were joking. \n\nBring up your disappointment and see how he reacts.

You mentioned at least 5 times in passing you didn\u2019t want a public proposal AND presumably he knows you well enough to know what he did do would make you SO uncomfortable. \n\nHe did it anyways because he wanted that scene from a movie. I\u2019d be concerned about a lifetime together of my wants and needs ignored during big or celebratory moments. \n\n2) Everything you describe sounds like his proposal required little to no effort, planning, etc.\n\nIt sounds like you put more time and effort into writing this Reddit post than for him to plan the proposal. \n\nFor big moments, if someone is taking the reins, I expect them to put in the effort called for by the task. OP wanted minimal effort, and he did nothing. \n\nI\u2019ve seen stories of HSers putting more effort into promposals than this man\u2019s actual marriage proposal.\n\n3) This was an important moment for both of you, but it fell flat.

Either you are excited to marry your partner even if it isn\u2019t how you dreamed but it\u2019s also his proposal.  I assume he bought the ring and the expectation is that the one proposing must make it some sort of event - you wanted a special dinner etc.  Being disappointed is valid but if you need grand gestures to feel happy in your relationship, that might not be who you are marrying.  Take some time before communicating this disappointment to your partner because if you are filled with this negative emotion, you will likely be more hurtful than you intend to be.  Congratulations and I wish you both a lifetime of happiness!", "I think it\u2019s true that the proposal is more for the man and the wedding for the woman.  There are so many Reddit posts about how hard it is to ask someone on a date.  Asking someone to marry you is 100x harder.  You\u2019re not talking about a single night.  You\u2019re asking her to trust you for the rest of your lives.  He had to build up a lot of courage to ask.  If he didn\u2019t do it then, it might have been a long time before he got up the courage to try again, if at all.  Your telling him you are disappointed in the proposal will crush him. \n\nI used to get a week at my grandmother\u2019s beach house every year.  I would bring my girlfriend, now wife, with me and it\u2019d be just the 2 of us until Wed when our friends would start to trickle in. I had planned to walk with her in the moonlight on the beach and ask her.  Monday night I asked if she wanted to go for a walk and she said no, she just wanted to hang out.  Tuesday night the same thing.  Wednesday morning came and I figured I\u2019d ask during the sunrise.  Again she said she didn\u2019t want to go out.  So then I went out anyway, figuring she\u2019d eventually follow me to see what\u2019s up.  After about 45 mins she hadn\u2019t come out so I went back in.  I sat next to her on the couch, held out the ring and said \u201cI was trying to make this romantic but you won\u2019t seem to have any of it so here you go, will you marry me?\u201d  She said yes, of course, but if she had said later that the proposal was disappointing then it would have crushed me, as it will your fiance.", "NAH. I don't think you are an AH for dreaming of what your proposal would look like. I honestly never gave it 2 thoughts, which was good as we eloped and I never did the engaged thing. Lol. I also understand being awkward myself how I would've reacted the same way you did. I would've worried about the onlookers and being in the way and what was I wearing and did I say the right things and did my face show I actually love him...I would've been in an anxiety moment and completely messed up one of the most special moments in our lives. At the same breath, your significant other should known you better and known that you wouldn't have wanted that, especially since you told him directly about it. I think he was thinking it would've been a meaningful magical moment and it flopped a bit. Just talk to him and tell him you are so excited about being engaged to him and cannot wait to spend time planning your future together. This is a moment in time and you have the rest of your lives to make wonderful memories. Go give him a kiss and tell him you love him. \n\nAs a side story about how engagement plans can go wrong: When my husband decided to surprise me a few years into our marriage with the \"engagement ring\" to match my wedding band, his original plan was to do it at Christmas time (my favorite time of year) with family around. His mistakenly told his mom about it and she asked me about it a few days before Christmas saying she wants to see the ring. I had no idea what she was talking about and looked at him like WTH? He was pissed she ruined the whole thing, but played it off like his mom is crazy and no idea what she is talking about. Lol. So when we got home from being out of town, he surprised me NYE instead and gave me a little speech that was super sweet and then gave me the ring. I can tell you didn't cry. I was more shocked he actually was able to fool me  than I was with the surprise. Lol. We laugh about it all now. So at the end of this all when the worry and wound heals, you will have a great story to tell and will laugh about it.....", "What is your motive to tell him?

Probably your fianc\u00e9 felt compelled by social pressure, maybe he thought that this must be what all girls want, or maybe he honestly likes a bit of public drama.

The fact that you discussed your proposal with him and stated multiple times that you didn\u2019t want a public proposal, and yet he did not think about this at all when planning his proposal is a problem that is only going to get worse if you don\u2019t address it. Thoughtfulness is extremely important to many in keeping a relationship healthy, and while it may be that your partner is just a little forgetful, you should talk to him about this, because based on his reaction, you\u2019ll learn a lot more. If he just apologizes and tells you he forgot about your previous conversations, or even redoes his proposal, you\u2019re golden, because he respects your feelings, but if he gets defensive, you\u2019re going to be having this argument throughout your marriage all the time. Now I\u2019m not saying the result of this is whether or not you break up, if this is your biggest problem I\u2019m sure everything will be fine, but you should definitely establish that you care about the effort he puts into having romantic moments.

That\u2019s the end of the sentence, don\u2019t add qualifiers or excuses on to soften it. That\u2019s the action, that\u2019s why you\u2019re upset. When you start thinking about getting into a long term relationship with someone, you actually CARE about that person and their wants/needs. This act gives the impression he does NOT care about what you wants because his wants (he wanted to do a public proposal) trump yours, his first, yours second. This is in direct contravention to what he\u2019s shown you of his character so far. One of the traps young people NEED to look out for is the one where a romantic partner will show only what attract them until they marriage locks them down and then change dramatically within the marriage because it\u2019s \u201csafe\u201d, because the partner can\u2019t easily flee once the real face comes out.\n\nI\u2019m not saying this is actually what you\u2019re dealing with, but I do think it\u2019s something you need to consider seriously. The \u2018why did he do it\u2019 is the crucial piece and it\u2019s missing. Of course you\u2019re concerned and upset.\n\nAlso do NOT under any circumstances push this under the rug because it\u2019s a \u201csmall\u201d thing, just a little insignificant moment you can both move past. Do you know what most divorces are made of? Small things, little things, every day, over and over, repeated in a thousand different ways, grinding you down a little smaller each day. DO sweat the small stuff, because it counts immensely. Do you know what lasting love is made of? The little things. The sweet little things, every day, here and there, over and over again, a thousand different ways, filling your heart to the brim.\n\nTalk to him. Tell him it made you unhappy and why (the not-listening to you, not considering your feelings in something that should have been about just you two, not how many people saw him, nor how you failed to \u201cperform\u201d adequately to his fantasy version of that proposal). Don\u2019t let this slide or it\u2019s likely to slide into place in your subconscious, a needle of resentment that will likely make greater problems later on. It\u2019s a little thing, but it\u2019s not. Life is made of little things more than anything else.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to nitpick every little thing over and over, but don\u2019t let small resentments gather without resolving them, especially this early in your relationship. Address them quickly, and then lay them to rest once resolved.", "NTA. You told him what would make you comfortable. He chose to ignore it. But he doesn\u2019t get to choose how you respond and his disappointment was a consequence of his decision. \n\nBoth of your feelings are valid and if it\u2019s bothering you this much, hash it out.

Finally, does he have to say kind words or is buying a ring and getting down on one knee enough?", "Nta - this is going to sound bad but my partner proposed to me while I was doing the dishes and covered in gunk when he knew that I wanted something special (not expensive, just required effort on his part) so I told him I wanted and deserved a redo because I'm not going to tell our engagement story for years to come with this. You deserve a redo because making you uncomfortable during a proposal is not the memory you should have.", "Yes", "ESH \n\nWhat would be the point? He didn't listen. You want to make sure that he knows and feels bad? You want a do over? \n\nIf you want to work on communicating better, you might use this as an example.

I really did not want a public proposal\n\nHe said something along the lines of \u201cbefore we get something to eat, I want to ask you something first\u201d and got down on one knee in the middle of the busy walk way with everyone passing by and looking at us, and asked if I would marry him. He didn\u2019t say anything like you make me happy, I want to spend the rest\nof my life with you, etc. \n\nI had a feeling that morning he was going to propose and I was getting nervous because I was like \u201chow is he going to propose to me here with all these people around? He knows I don\u2019t want to be proposed to in public.\u201d I said it to him at least 5 times in passing discussions when we would talk about getting married. I am somewhat shy and I knew being in public would make it hard for me to enjoy the moment. And it did\n\nI looked at him and quickly said yes because he was in the way of a ton of people walking by and I wanted everyone to stop looking at us. Afterwards I was just like \u201cso do you still want to go eat?\u201d And he said \u201cwell that was anti-climactic.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say because I was excited to be engaged because I do love him so much and have no doubts about marrying him but I was also hurt he proposed in public when I asked him not to and then said to me \u201cthat was anticlimactic\u201d because he explained later he thought I would cry, be more emotional, etc.\n\nI definitely think I would have cried and been more emotional had he done it more intimately! I literally would have been fine and happy with him doing it in our home with some nice heartfelt words and then like a reservation to dinner later that night somewhere local. I don\u2019t ask for a lot. I just didn\u2019t want it in public because I knew I\u2019d feel uncomfortable. \n\nAnd then we just walked around the market like it was any other day after and it was kind of strange! Haha. And we got food to go and ate it at home, watched tv, and went to bed. There was no dinner reservation or like any sort of something special planned after the proposal to be able to celebrate together. \n\nAgain, I love him. No doubt about that or marrying him. And I get why he proposed there (it\u2019s somewhere we go every Valentine\u2019s Day) but I am really hurt that he did it in public when I didn\u2019t want him to. And I did bring it up to him jokingly in another discussion one time and he said \u201cwell you can\u2019t pick how you\u2019re proposed to\u201d and that\u2019s hurtful too. Also that he was upset with me that I didn\u2019t cry/that it was anticlimactic so it made me feel guilty like I didn\u2019t respond the \u201cright way\u201d and disappointed him.\n\nI keep telling myself it\u2019s fine and whatever. The marriage is more important than a proposal. But I keep thinking back to it every now and then and I get really sad. I feel like I want to tell him nicely but I don\u2019t know if I should.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

When you tie your life together with someone permanently you should be able to tell them anything. You've written out your feelings in a very gentle and respectful manner, and you deserve to let them be known. Congrats on the engagement :)", "It sounds to me like he was really set on proposing there and maybe didn't think much further than that. I believe you said the location is of significance to you both because you go there every Valentine's Day? Is it possible that he didn't even think about the amount of people that would be around and that he thought this location was just really special to you both? The way you describe him he sounds like a really good guy, so I kind of want to believe he didn't go against your wishes on purpose.\n\nI also totally understand you didn't want to be proposed to in public. I'm the same way, I hate being the center of attention. I would talk about it with your fiance, because it's clearly still bothering you (understandably - you don't feel heard). Maybe you can start talking about the location, memories you made there and ask him why he decided to propose there. You could say that you love the market and how romantic it was that he got down on one knee, but that you felt a little uncomfortable and like you had to rush, because it was so busy there and people wanted to pass. And that that's also the reason you didn't cry (as he knows you don't feel uncomfortable in crowded spaces). \n\nI know I'm a hopeless romantic, but what I would love for you is that you'd get a bit of a do-over in the intimacy of your own home. Maybe just by you telling him how much you love him and how excited you are to marry him. Hopefully he will then tell you the same thing\ud83d\ude0b Add some candles and wine and maybe that could take away your \"disappointment\" about the proposal?

He gets the reaction he wants and you get the privacy you want. Everyone wins. \n\nMethod 2: You do the proposal and thus have control over the situation. I totally agree with you that having people stare or doing this kind of thing publicly is awkward.  Assuming you know his preferences, this could have ended up in a nice result for both of you. \n\nObviously nothing can be done about it now except to communicate respectfully to him that if you have preferences, hangups, boundaries, peeves, etc that they are important and you aren't just saying them just to say them. He needs to take you seriously.  If I were in your shoes, that more macro level consideration would be my concern over the proposal itself.", "NTA.

He put you in an uncomfortable situation.  It would be impossible for you to be in the moment under those circumstances.\n\nIt seems to me that you both had different ideas of how the kind of proposal you wanted, and he chose to deliberately do exactly what you didn't want.  I don't know what to make of that, other than it comes across as tone deaf and selfish.\n\nI'm sure he has similar feelings to you, in that he had something pictured in his head that didn't come to be.

It was the method and disregard for OP's preferences which are the most hurtful, things which are important to keep in mind for things like proposals.\n\nIt just sounds like OP's fiance had a very different proposal scene in mind, one of those ones you see on TV where the bride-to-be cries heartfelt tears and a crowd gathers to ooh and aww. The only problem is that this was directly antithetical to what OP wanted, and that she had directly indicated this desire some time before the proposal had happened.\n\nI think it's careless, not manipulative. It sounded like they were both on board for a proposal to go ahead, what would deliberately making the situation uncomfortable achieve in that case?\n\nI think that letting him know how she felt about his choice to disregard her feelings about it is important to do. That doesn't need to involve saying the proposal was horrible, just that the publicity was uncomfortable and that she would have preferred it happened somewhere else (which would have given OP the peace of mind to display the sort of emotional reaction fiance had hoped he would get). And then, of course, a reassurance about the answer.\n\nThe communication is important. OP, I think honesty about the proposal is good, without being unkind, and together you can work to be more open and communicative about further aspects of your relationship. I truly hope that hearing your side of the event will open your fiance's eyes to his choices, and open a better line of communication between you moving forward.", "Very true! What will it accomplish? I agree with that. But yes I agree maybe talking about disregarding my feelings about not wanting it to be in public in a non-confrontational way could be a way to do it, IF I decide to say something. It\u2019s hard to explain your relationship to strangers, haha. But I told someone else who said it was manipulative - I don\u2019t think he was trying to be manipulative.

You could ask him to propose again in a way you're more comfortable with, so you can show him how you feel when you respond.\n\nWin-win-win: you win, with a second proposal; he wins, with a better response; you both win, having communicated clearly and resolved a disagreement.", "It was already ruined for you.

Please talk some more about this.  And if you can't, that is an issue that will be easier to deal with before you get married.", "He didn't seem to put any effort into it, so I don't see why he's surprised by her lack of reaction.

She made it clear multiple times beforehand that she didn\u2019t want a public proposal.  He chose not to listen or respect or wish and then made a somewhat shitty comment when he didn\u2019t get the reaction he was hoping for.\n\nAs someone that just popped the question a few months ago I put myself in their shoes.

And how often are you \u201chappy to go along with his preference, because you don\u2019t mind, and he feels more strongly about it\u201d. \n\nMaybe play with this a little bit. \n\nMake a practice of thinking about what you would prefer to do that day / that evening - *before* you discuss it with him. \n\nIt would be interesting to know how easy you find that - thinking about your preference & being clear on what you would like. With no input from anyone else. \n\nAnd then once you\u2019re clear on how you would prefer to spend the day (maybe that\u2019s on your own, reading a book & relaxing) then see if you can make that be the plan for the day *even if that\u2019s not what he would prefer to do that day*. \n\nI\u2019m curious.", "You gotta be able to say your feelings.

I can easily argue the way he wanted this to go is no more or less important than the way you wanted it to go - even if I realize most people think it's more crucial that the woman be happy. \n\nBut this isn't supposed to be about a moment, not about the proposal, or the wedding - this is about planning to have a life with someone. And for that to work out, you need to figure out a way to deal with different ideas and priorities.

Let him know that for future romantic gestures, you want him to pay more attention to your preferences. \n\nIf he doesn't react well or is dismissive of such clear but kind feedback, then you need to really think about if he's the right partner for you. Will he half-ass anniversary plans, birthday plans, holiday plans, plans for your kids (if you have any)?

I don\u2019t think it was necessarily his intention to make me feel bad", "Then you ask him why he chose to do that in a non confrontational way.Otherwise I think it will eat you up.", "Hahaha that\u2019s so sweet though. You guys sound like a lovely couple. All the best to you both and thank you for sharing \ud83d\ude0a", "This. OP, you DID tell him MULTIPLE TIMES what would make you uncomfortable, & he just ignored that & went ahead & did what he wanted anyway, & then tweaked you for not having the reaction he was hoping for!! I would bet $$ that this is not the only time he has ignored your feelings or needs--I would very, VERY seriously reconsider marrying this person. Be honest with yourself about the relationship & examine it closely--what other times has he ignored your wishes after you have clearly communicated them? And you justified it/brushed it off bc he is \"so great\" in so many other ways? \n\nAlso, he put in absolutely zero effort for this proposal in absolutely any other capacity. As someone who ignored her gut & nearly married a guy who treated me exactly like this, please, please, for the love of your future self, give this relationship a HARD look before you walk down that aisle \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude4f", "Agreed. He should be able to handle hearing that you didn\u2019t like the proposal. That you love him and want to marry him, but in order to get the reaction HE wanted, he should\u2019ve listened and cared about what YOU wanted. I\u2019m personally glad he\u2019s disappointed, and that it was anticlimactic for him, it should be a learning lesson. Maybe he should even reconsider a do over. You shouldn\u2019t feel guilty though.. You said how you felt about a public proposal and he did it anyway. It was just as bad of an experience for him as it was for you, rightfully.", "You are correct.", "I agree with you, Slight_Nail. These 2 don\u2019t seem to communicate well at all; she expresses that she does not want a public proposal, and he proposes in a crowded marketplace. Wait until she tells him she doesn\u2019t want their wedding cake smashed in her face.", "No\n\nWhere is your reading comprehension? That\u2019s not at all what she said. \n\nShe said there is no reason to tear fianc\u00e9 down and make them feel bad about the proposal. OP can still make her needs known without criticizing him.", "OP, really take the \u201cnegative\u201d comments into consideration and address them BEFORE marriage. Plenty of marriages don\u2019t work because things like this only PILE UP.", "This needs to be higher, this was a test of a highly stressful and important life event (Which will continue to happen forever) and he...wasn't thinking about Her??  This guy just assumed she'd say yes and assumes she will always go his way cause judging by the other comments OP people pleases and usually does just fall in line. OP I think you may have unfortunately created a false image of yourself to him who is just a Yes Girl. This can only end in disaster unless you stop being afraid and get honest and real; BEFORE you get married or you'll be back here in 3 years asking why your husband says you've changed and can't stand you once you finally start being real. Do it now.", "I will say this, after I babbled and babbled \u2013 it occurred to me that any possible positive reaction he wanted, or hoped would happen? Should have been negated by the fact that she already said, I do not want this in public\u2026. So perhaps they have a change of heart decide not to do this anymore\u2026 Or she marries him anyway and five years later, she wakes up to a new car in the driveway one day\u2026 And his responses I wanted to surprise you!!\n\nI think one of the most undreamy and creepy things ever Is when you tell somebody please do not do this multiple times\u2026 And then they do just that and get mad at your reaction for not being excited\u2026 That\u2019s a scary feeling.\n\nYou\u2019re right I didn\u2019t see it originally but you\u2019re right \u2013 thank you for talking", "We usually do things like this! And like I said to other people here, we are usually SO in tune with each other so the whole thing was so confusing! Haha. But yes. I think we can absolutely be more intentional about things moving forwards like you and your wife do. That\u2019s a great. You guys sound lovely \ud83d\ude0a Thank you for the advice!!", "No! You\u2019re not the asshole!! You were answering with your gut reaction and I appreciate it \ud83d\ude0a I agree with you! I don\u2019t want a good thing to go to waste either. And thank you!! You take care as well!", "Hahah oh no! I\u2019m glad you understand what I\u2019m saying!! But yes, it\u2019s not important in the long run.", "So it would have been better if he proposed in a way HE didn't like ? A couple is 2 people.\n\nAgain. Expressing your emotion is not manipulative. He didn't express them in order to hurt OP. He did that to communicate.\n\nI understand you are a pacifist, but sometime, in a relation, you will say thing that will hurt your partner. It's kinda normal and healthy. The only important thing is WHY are you doing it. Did you said it because you wanted to communicate your emotions and wanted to start a discussion ? Or did you say it only to hurt the person and make them feel bad ?\n\nWe don't have any proof here that he said it with the only goal to hurt OP. With the way OP describe their partner, it looks way more like he wanted to address the situation.", "That is not what manipulative means. Furthermore I don't think your description is the case here. He wasn't deliberately shaming OP for her reaction, he was stating disappointment at a different reaction from what he had expected or pictured. \n\nIt just sounds like a carelessly fumbled proposal, wherein fiance doing the proposing made a bad call on place, and felt awkward it didn't go better, and fiancee being proposed to wasn't able to react properly due to aforementioned bad choice of place, and felt awkward she couldn't react more enthusiastically.\n\nManipulation is an involved process involving a pattern of behaviours designed to control someone. I truly doubt that is the case here. People in this subreddit seem far too quick sometimes to jump to throwing out clinical words like this, without using them correctly OR understanding what they actually mean.\n\nOP's fiancee made some bad choices here, but it seems more due to carelessness rather than malevolent intention or as part of some larger game. I think he just had an obtuse moment or vision in mind and wanted OP to enjoy the same scene as he wanted to enjoy. At minimum there are some communication issues involved, but it wasn't manipulation.", "Exactly. There's been times over the years that me and my husband have missed the mark in terms of doing nice things for each other. We just tell each other and take the feedback on board and move on from it. What kind of a relationship have you got if you can't even tell your partner that something they did wasn't to your liking?", "Ditto. This is not a good precedent for marriage, regardless of how small and one time this thing may be", "Thank you all for your thoughts and opinions! I really do appreciate everyone viewpoint. It\u2019s hard to explain and include all the details under 3,000 characters! Haha. So I\u2019m sorry for getting everyone riled up. I could have explained myself much better. I posted because I feel like the asshole for being upset because he is a great guy otherwise and always respects my opinions/feelings so I feel guilty for being disappointed and wanted peoples opinions to see if it was worth saying something. So thank you for sharing yours! All the best to you.", "A proposal is meant to make the person being proposed to feel loved! If you do it in a way that disregards that person's expressed preferences, that sucks! That's not a good proposal.\n\nAnd bringing it up with him isn't about hurting him. It's about making sure he understands that in a relationship, you have to listen and be aware and considerate. Also, given OP's description of herself as a people pleaser, I think it would probably be good for her to assert herself a little more.", "Why the sharp turn? It doesn\u2019t have to be what she likes versus what he likes. This isn\u2019t battle. There was a way to propose where they both are satisfied. It just takes a little bit of planning and compromise to satisfy both parties. \n\nFor example, a private proposal in their apartment (spruced up or decorated), and then a mini celebration with loved ones at a restaurant afterwards sounds like something they both would have enjoyed. \n\nAn \u201ceither or\u201d mindset tends to be the quickest way to shoot yourself (and others) in the foot. \n\nAlso, while \u201cwhy\u201d is important, it is not the only important thing. Context (among other things) is important too. Again, stay away from sharp corners.", "Love is the scary thing. Emotion is a scary thing and for now you must objectively look at the fact that you discussed multiple times, do not do this action in public\u2026 And he did that action In public \u2013 now, short of a life threatening situation, he should respect your view on that \u2013 no matter what view he may have had \u2013 in fact, it was another poster here that made me realize I was originally thinking wrong \u2013 but good luck, and I mean that with all sincerity be safe friend"]}
