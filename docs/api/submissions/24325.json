The most disappointing birthday I\u2019ve ever had. I didn\u2019t make any plans for the actual day because it\u2019s a Wednesday, but planned to throw a party at my house with my friends and family this Saturday. For the actual day I still went to work and everything was normal, but I wanted something simple so I asked my family (mom, dad and brother) the night before to go out to dinner with me at a nice restaurant I\u2019ve been wanting to try. I confirmed a time that would work for everyone and made the reservation for 7:30pm. \n\nMy dad called to wish me a happy birthday and tried to convince me to go to my cousins house, who happened to be throwing a bbq of some sort. I said I\u2019d rather not because I really wanted to try this restaurant and just wanted to celebrate with them, it\u2019d feel really weird for me going to a party of some sort when it happens to be my bday and the attention I would get would be in genuine bc nobody at the bbq realized it was my birthday. My dad says ok no problem. This was a nice restaurant that are very strict with reservations so I looked really nice and arrived right on time.\n\n My mom, who has not acknowledged it was my birthday calls me and says her and my dad are still at the house and need to shower and get ready, but my brother is on the way to meet me there so we should order appetizers. 5 min later my brother calls me and tells me he\u2019s going to be late as well, that he\u2019s also at the house and I should get the table myself. Now I know this restaurant was not going to seat me without my whole party, and after a certain time they\u2019d give the table away. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore so I hung up on my brother, parked at a building near by and cried. I was so upset I declined all his and my moms calls. \n\nAt 8pm 30 min after the reservation, my family pull up behind my car so I can\u2019t back out and surrounds my car. I\u2019m in shock bc I purposely parked at a random building, but forgot my brother has my location on find my friends. So they surround the car, and start talking about what a long day everyone has had and how I should come with them to find a restaurant that will take us. I tell them I\u2019ve been crying, mascara running all down my face and do not want to be out in public or with them. My dad says I don\u2019t look upset and my mom keeps telling me to calm down. They were not understanding that this wasn\u2019t a \u201chaha ok I\u2019m overreacting\u201d situation so I had to basically yell at them that it was too late and to leave me alone. They left and went to my cousins house. I got whattaburger on my way home and ate it myself. I was still so upset I barely slept, and texted the family groupchat they ruined my birthday and I didn\u2019t want them coming to my party Saturday. I\u2019m still so upset this morning.

You asked very little of them - a nice family dinner at a restaurant you were really looking forward to trying - and they treated you like an afterthought, made you lose your reservation, and then didn't even care enough to be apologetic after ruining the only thing you wanted for your birthday. I would have been so hurt if I were you. I'm so sorry they did that.", "NTA. It was very rude of them to brush off your emotions like that. The fact is, they really wanted to go to the cousin's BBQ instead of your birthday dinner, so that's why they tried to get you to go with them. It's also very worrisome to me that a 25yo woman's brother (or any family member) has a locator for her on his phone. They like to keep tabs on you for some bizarre reason, and you need to put a stop to it.", "NTA. That sucked, sorry OP. Are your family chronically late to everything?", "NTA\n\nYour family sucks. This feels like it was always a ploy to go to your cousins BBQ. Also, disable your location, that's actually pretty invasive.\n\nMake your plans next year with friends without your family. They're gonna let you down again", "NTA.  Your parents and brother didn't show up; after showing up like a bunch of clowns they should have been profusely apologetic but instead tried to deflect their sh!tty actions and push you into something that was never going to be celebratory for you.", "NTA it was your birthday they did not care about it in the slightest so you got very sad, and angry when they dismissed your feelings. Completely normal reaction from you.\n\nDo not invite them back to your party. If they will want to make up with you, I think you should give them a chance, but on your terms. You can give them a chance to meet on sth like this again, but they are paying and you can do this when it is convenient time-wise for you.", "My only comment is that you made a reservation 1 day in advance and should have done something sooner.", "I mean.. I get it, but I'm going to say ESH.\n\nBy 25, it's pretty much all birthdays are diminishing till the end. If you wanted to make it a higher priority it should have been communicated much earlier.\nYour family tried to make amends and do the dinner. 30 minutes late by 8pm isn't even that late. I feel you could have still gone to eat but decided it wasn't about the food. Make up aside, it really feels like it was salvageable.\n\nI've had family be hour(s) late. So I took initiative to say we start at 6pm when it's really 7pm. Just depends on how much you want them to be there. But crying after half an hour, refusing to salvage it, and going to group chat is (to me) attention seeking for drama. They shouldn't have been late.", "NTA. You could have been a bit more organised and let people know 'I want to do X' with a bit more notice, but otherwise you made your wants known, everyone agreed and everyone let you down.\n\nWhilst having a but of a meltdown might feel like an overreaction, getting yourself all excited and geared up for something only to realise bit by bit that it's not going to happen, that other people that should have been there have let you down, and especially if there's a feeling of missing an obligation (such as a reservation time) is a huge crash and I don't think it's unreasonable to react emotionally in that state. Especially if you feel that your emotions are being brushed off, which adds fuel to the fire.\n\nIf this is a 1 off, then your family dropped the ball. If this is a habit, they suck and you should not include them in important plans to save yourself getting overwrought.", "NTA", "ESH but mostly you. Your parents and your brother were late to your birthday dinner but they all called and let you know ahead of time that they were going to be late. They should have tried harder to be on time. You on the other hand, You booked a dinner that required reservations the night before the dinner and expected everyone to drop an already planned event and come to your dinner instead. Then when people were late, you tried absolutely nothing to fix the situation whatsoever and went and sat in your car and cried and then threw a temper tantrum for the rest of the evening. Grow up.", "Hmmm. \n\nYTA? \n\n1.) I think you are either very easy to get upset, or there are some key Details missing. Like, why do you have a full meltdown? Is your family abusive? If not, this seems a bit of a ... dramatic Response?\n2.) You have your actual Party on saturday anyways. Basically you wanted kinda like two parties? I would say it is understandable that your family did not think it was a huge deal and wasnt rushing to get there immediatly. \n3.) It was on very short notice as far as i understood.\n4.) They might have had obligations to also show up at the bbq and because of that were late. \n5.) There was miscommunication. Your parents thought you just go in and have a fun start with your brother while they would be coming later. Your brother told you he was late, too, without them knowing it. Coupled with the fact (?) It was on short notice, things can go wrong. \n6.) They wanted to make it up to you. \n7.) You hid from them. Who knows how long they were searching you? They mightve been there since a while, realized their mistake and search for you. \n8.) You are 25. Birthdays are normally tmnit THAT important anymore in that age. You should habe communicated it clearly that it was important to you.\n\nI get your Anger, i really hate it when someone stoods me up, too. And they did some things bad, too. But I think it was a case of sorrt notice and piled on miscommunication.\nInstead of being dramatic and hiding, use your Phone and call them. Tell them you are Loosing the Reservation and make New Plans. Do not break down communications. Maybe you would have gotten an \"your brother also cannot make it in time? Crap. We thought you two couldve just gone in. Sorry honey. We meet at 8 then and find a new restaurant. This one we then go to next week, alright? Love you.\" \n\nOr did is misread something?", "ESH.\n\nSure, your family shouldn\u2019t have been late - that\u2019s rude - but you\u2026 did not have an adult reaction.\n\n1. You made the reservation only the night before, so they had to adjust their plans on very short notice. \n\n2. When they can\u2019t make it on time, you don\u2019t check with the restaurant if they can hold the table, you withdraw somewhere to cry. \n\n3. When your family shows up, you have to be even more dramatic about it, pointing out the fact that you\u2019ve been crying. \n\n4. And then, instead of salvaging the evening you throw a giant temper tantrum. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s your bday and you can cry if you want to and all that, but\u2026 I think you need to seriously have a think about how you deal with inconveniences in life so you don\u2019t fall into pieces every time things don\u2019t go your way. Because this was a lot.", "YTA - talk about over dramatise everything \u2026 yes it\u2019s a pain, and not thoughtful of them but assuming a restaurant you have never been in before won\u2019t seat you, especially when you say it's your birthday and can prove it -  hanging up on the call, sitting on your own sobbing and then yelling at them to force home your dramatic point all sounds utterly exhausting. If this is your usual way of dealing with things when they go wrong i\u2019m not surprised they were a bit taken aback. As it happens you probably were over reacting - and you still are.", "YTA. What an overreaction. You sound dramatic and exhauating.", "YTA.\n\nI don't think YOU understand that this WAS a \"haha OK you're overreacting\" situation. I mean, hey, it's your birthday and you can cry if you want to. But dramatically declining calls? Throwing a tantrum in a parking lot? And the way they surrounded your car tells me they're used to your dramatics, so this is probably normal behavior for you. You're 25 going on 15.\n\nPeople have lives, and your birthday doesn't make the world stop. If ***THIS*** is your worse birthday ever, consider yourself lucky. YOU ruined your birthday. Learn to roll with the punches, you'll be happier for it.", "ESH. The BBQ was probably planned well in advance and your family committed to going. When you issued a day before invitation to the restaurant, they should have said, \"We have already told Cousin Elmo that we would be at the party and he has purchased and started preparing food. It would be rude to not show up. Could we take you out to dinner on another night? Of course we are looking forward to your party on Saturday. \n\nThey were unfair to Cousin Elmo for standing him up, but once they told you they were going to meet you at the restaurant, they were also rude to you. \n\nWere they late because they stopped by the BBQ first, trying to please everyone?", "Esh It\u2019s time for you to grow up", "NTA, but you are being over dramatic", "NAH - It definitely sucks that they were late, you would hope that they would have showered, prepared etc. early to ensure they would make it. But tbh 30 minutes isn\u2019t *that* bad. It\u2019s definitely annoying, and you certainly have ample justification to be frustrated that literally none of them made it on time, but it\u2019s also not so long that I feel like it\u2019s worth having what was basically a meltdown over it. The reality is that we live in the real world where stuff happens and mistakes are made, sometimes people are late, it sucks but it happens. \n\nMeanwhile I don\u2019t want to put you on blast *too* much because I know birthdays have different significance to different people, but all the same I do think your reaction was a tad dramatic for a 25 year old. Especially because you didn\u2019t even *try* to explain and see if the restaurant could hold the table, and when your family tried to offer alternatives and solutions you just cried and shut them down. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for being upset and won\u2019t label you as such, but your reaction was a bit\u2026overdone.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s some extra info that would change my mind, like they have a habit of ignoring/not caring/being late to big events and milestones in your life and this was merely the final straw. But as a one-off this doesn\u2019t really seem like a big deal.", "YTA they were trying to throw you a surprise party.", "INFO: I know the reservation was late, but did they know you wanted to do a dinner in advance?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's an asshole thing to do. \n\nBut let me put my conclusion on it. They never wanted to go, they hoped that they could get her to go to the BBQ so they sabotaged the dinner on purpose. \n\nAnd the mom saying he brother was on the way when he wasn't also her not saying happy birthday at all makes me believe that it was intentional.

That should be brought up when the plans are made and has no relevance on this IMO.\n\n>When they can\u2019t make it on time, you don\u2019t check with the restaurant if they can hold the table, you withdraw somewhere to cry.\n\nYes how dare she not try to fight with a really nice restaurant to hold a reservation indefinitely (no one even gave OP an ETA except the parents saying the brother's ETA incorrectly) for people who collectively couldn't get a single person to leave their house at the time they were supposed to ARRIVE.\n\n>When your family shows up, you have to be even more dramatic about it, pointing out the fact that you\u2019ve been crying.\n\nHonestly the closest to an honest point and seems to be your real issue.

The family was just not considerate of anyone else. \n\nIf the time had not worked for them, they could have discussed that with OP first. \n\nLastly, 24 hours seems likely plenty of notice for dinner of all things. You gotta eat EVERY SINGLE DAY afterall, how much more notice do you need for dinner? They just didn't make her a priority. \n\nChronic late people make these excuses.

It's only 30 mins late, she made the booking the day before and the actual birthday plans were at the weekend.

Then they find her after she cancels and instead of acknowledging their mistake, choose to invalidate her feelings and try and brush it off with new plans. \n\nThe issue isn't the reservation, it's the fact that her family cared so little they either didn't take it seriously enough to actually get ready and show up on time, or chose not to tell her that something came up and they'd be late until they were already supposed to be there, ruining the plans entirely.", "I don't take this as victim blaming.

Sure! But most adults I know stop treating birthdays as this special unique day after 18. 21 matters, but for sightly different reasons.

If that were the case then I agree it would be an entirely different story. \n\nThey said they were at \u201cthe house\u201d, meaning at home, and that they needed to shower, prepare etc. Losing track of time and being a little late with preparations is not nearly the sin that intentionally prioritizing someone else\u2019s event is, and I correspondingly rate them as less \u201cassholey\u201d.\n\nThe dad mentions/suggests the bbq as an alternative to the restaurant, but there\u2019s nothing in the post that confirms the parents and brother went there at all, let alone went there instead of OPs restaurant.", "Yes, what a bunch of assholes, trying to carve out time in their schedule for their daughter's rude, last-minute invite.\n\n\"AITA for being mad at my parents for refusing to come to my birthday dinner because they 'already had plans?'\"", "Right this is what pisses me off. They said they would be there and they worked out a time. It doesn't matter after that, you are a dick if you don't do what you said you would.\n\nImagine this being a first date, Reddit would rip the date a new asshole for showing up 30 mins late. But parents and brother, 3 different people get a pass.", "Right this is what pisses me off. They said they would be there and they worked out a time. It doesn't matter after that, you are a dick if you don't do what you said you would.\n\nImagine this being a first date, Reddit would rip the date a new asshole for showing up 30 mins late. But parents and brother, 3 different people get a pass.", "And unless they work hard labor or otherwise dirty jobs, why would they suddenly realize \\*at the time they agreed to meet\\* that they all still needed to shower and get ready? This was incredibly poor time management on their parts.", "Unfortunately, OP hasn't told us why everybody was late; car trouble?  Traffic?  Workplace emergency that kept them late?\n\nOP made plans *the night before.*  OP needs to make realistic allowances for how they graciously tried to fit her into their existing plans.  She ran away crying after *five minutes.*", "I've also made plenty of 24 hour plans with adult family and friends. It's not impossible. I also try to give priority if a friend's birthday is coming up.\n\nSometimes getting into a nice restaurant can be done by calling at the cancel window.", "She stormed off after five minutes.  She made zero allowances for the fact that a) she was making a huge ask on 24-hours-notice, and b) real life happens.", "Exactly!! My family is notorious for changing plans at the last second but I know to carve out time on everyone\u2019s birthday and just not make plans that day if they want to do something as a family", "Also mentioned this downthread, but calling right at the cancel window is a good way to get a reservation at a nice restaurant. Especially a newer one that might be in high demand. IIRC one of the reservation platforms even has a section for \"Last Minute Finds.\"", "She set herself up for failure when she tried to organize this with 24 hours notice, then got salty that adults had plans.", "I agree but am being downvoted to oblivion haha. Shrugs shoulders.\n\nI'd rather do *something* other than crying and eating alone on my bday. And still express my hurt and disappointment and take action steps to make other plans with other people if it ever happens again.", "She ran away crying after five minutes.  Five minutes.", ">  but I wanted something simple so I asked my family (mom, dad and brother) **the night before to go out to dinner with me** at a nice restaurant I\u2019ve been wanting to try.\n\nShe gave them 24 hours notice, *at best.*", "Then cornering her and forcing the discussion before she had any time to process it. I'm a pretty level dude, but if my parents did that to me, no discussion is happening that night. I'm removing myself, and we talk another day.", "still them, but twice. double booking is a shitty thing to do.", "The family, I still think. You can give a soft-RSVP (it's up to the host to accept it or not) if you know something else important shares that day. BBQs are also usually a bit larger, so a few people dropping out is less impactful than an intimate dinner with your immediate family.\n\nIt also comes down to standard practice in the family - in my family it would be assumed you're probably doing a dinner the night of the birthday, so keep it open unless told otherwise. Better, be proactive and ask if they want to do something.", "The family, obviously? You don't RSVP yes to simultaneous events and then blame the organizer.", "They are for saying yes to two invites.  Just tell OP they can\u2019t go to the dinner or beg off for the barbecue.  Don\u2019t try to hit both.", "I don\u2019t think they were trying to ruin dinner at all. \n\nMy point was that they tried to make it work and she handled it horribly.", "They didn\u2019t flake. \n\nShe left after 5 minutes.", "Honestly, that was my take too. Seemed like the family felt like they couldn't say no, but that's all speculative and wouldn't actually change the rating imo.\n\nStill an ESH for me from how they handled it. You can't just commit and drop the ball. But what you pointed out could definitely determine the...balance of blame within the ESH.", "I tend to take a pretty militant line on \"don't hard commit to something and then deprioritize it and no/late show without telling the other party\". Imo if that happens, there's an automatic TA element unless there's an actual emergency.", "They showed up to the random location she moved to 30 minutes late. Not the restaurant. \n\nSo they had to find her too. For all we know they may have actually made within the 15 minute window.", "Is being too irresponsible to make a dinner on time any better? Either way, they're making it clear they don't prioritize her or her feelings, even on her special day. Asshole behavior.", "DM the OP her brother\u2019s name so she can confirm.", "By last minute invite, do you mean 1440 minutes because that's how much 24 hours is. And the parents didn't refuse to come, they said they would and then didn't. If they said no we have plans and then she had this reaction, it wouldn't be acceptable.", "I think it also helps how much Reddit hates Birthdays and people who have a reasonable relationship with their families.", "It almost seems like they wanted her to call it off so they could go to the bbq.", "Um, no, that\u2019s why they agreed on a time. If that time didn\u2019t work for them, they should have said so and suggested one that would. Why do you keep harping on the fact that the invitation came 24 hours before the event? You\u2019ve never made plans a day in advance? It\u2019s really simple: if someone invites you to something last minute and you can\u2019t make it, you just say \u201cI can\u2019t make it\u201d.", "No, she stormed after waiting for them for one hour. The reservation was for 7.30 and the family appeared at 8.30", "Nope. If they had plans they would have said so. They tried to change plans they made with OP on day of because they wanted to go to a BBQ.", "Then they shouldn't have said that they can go to dinner. Would it have been difficult for them to say \"sorry, we already have plans, we can't come\"? Everybody is pilling on on OP, whilst overlooking the fact that no one forced the parents to accept the invitation.", "You think OP wouldn't rather do something else too? We can only control emotions so far when we're hurt.\n\nYou're not smarter, you're just putting in endless effort for nothing in return.", "Have you ever been stood up? Especially by family. There's definitely an emotional release that happens.", "Five after been waiting for one hour. The reservation was for 7.30, the afamily meet her at 8.30", "Then, as adults, they should say, \"we can't make it. We already said yes to (insert event), \" Don't say yes and be 30 min late, so you loose the reservation.", "Adults can communicate though. \"OP sorry, but that is tomorrow night and your cousin is having a BBQ as you know. We thought you were just having your party on the weekend because that's what you told us about.\"\n\nInstead they agreed and then just didn't show up on time and didn't seem to really care that literally every person that was invited and said they would come, showed up well past what is reasonably late.", "I mean, 25-years-old isn't 'family automatically blocks the date' out age.\n\nLet alone the whole 'the plans were actually Saturday, then OP did a last minute thing, and started bawling because everybody couldn't drop their previous commitments.'", "If they didn't want to do it they should have been  honest & said so.", "She already had birthday plans for Saturday and they planned for that. \n\nThey are not obligated to keep the day open just because it\u2019s her birthday. She didn\u2019t even actually plan to do things that day until the night before. Y\u2019all are mad.", "Plus they didn't just agree to dinner. They agreed to dinner at that time, at a place where it required a reservation.\n\nIf a later time would have been better, they should have been saying so when time was discussed.\n\nIf they were running late, they should have let OP know when they realized it, not at the reservation time.\n\nIf they really wanted to go to that bbq instead, they should have said so upfront.\n\nLots of ways the family could have handled those sorts of issues better.\n\nOther big issue I see is how they behaved when they showed up. I mean blocking her car so she couldn't leave then surrounding it? That had me suspicious of them right there.\n\nThe whole description of their behavior there makes me wonder if they regularly downplay and dismiss OPs feelings. No apologies. Just excuses and deflection.\n\nI'm not surprised OP is upset, even if it's not their normal behavior. If stuff like this is common from them, then absolutely no surprise at all.\n\nOP is NTA imo.", "Oh I see, I must apologize then. I wasn\u2019t aware I was speaking with someone whose never ever been late to something ever in their entire life.\nBut I must warn you that down here in the land of us mere mortals people sometimes make mistakes, show up a late for things, etc. Shit happens, and it isn\u2019t really that big of a deal. Please spare us from your righteous fury, oh blessed lord of 100% always being perfectly on time.\n\nSure it sucks, and sure they deserve a little bit of admonishment for it, but it\u2019s really not that big a deal. Completely breaking into hysterics and apparently throwing a tantrum over it is an extremely overdramatic thing for an adult to do, unless there\u2019s more context here that hasn\u2019t been shared with us.", "That 100% believe that if OP had asked her parents \"okay, Where do you want to go to dinner?\" They would have said the cousin's house BBQ\n\nHe family did get dirty she has a right to be pissed. I wouldn't cry but I sure as shit wouldn't invite them over to celebrate my birthday after they showed what my birthday meant to them. So her actions although a little strange to me are well within an acceptable range to me.", "Given how dramatic and overreactive OP is, yeah, I could just see her absolutely flipping out that her rude, last minute invite was declined \"on my birthdaaaaaaaaaaaay!\"  Shame on them for trying to make the time.\n\n\"AITA for being mad at my parents for refusing to come to my birthday dinner because they 'already had plans?'\"", "She stormed off after *five minutes.*", "Nothing stopping them from proposing a different night for a dinner too. Instead they handled it in an AH way.", "They had plans with OP. If they had other plans they should have mentioned it and said they couldn't make dinner. But they agreed ro dinner so whatever other plans they had are moot at that point.", "I've honestly found the opposite as I've gotten older. You see your immediate family less as you get older, so they're more inclined to give you that day as an excuse to get together.", "They were trying to make time for her, even though she was rude and unreasonable in springing 'birthday dinner' on them the night before.", "Then they should've said \"No, we're seeing you on Saturday\" like adults when she asked.", "It's not a big deal to you. Other people are entitled to their feelings. They lost their reservation at the nice restaurant as a result of her family's blanket lack of time management skills. Then they had the gall to show up completely unapologetic, block her in, and start berating her for being hurt by their disrespect. Assholes. \n\nNo one thinks being late is socially unacceptable in all instances, but it certainly was in this context.", "If they had a surprise party why did they say yes to go to the restaurant. That makes absolutely zero sense. If the surprise party was ruined its because they threw a wrench in their own plans by accepting an invite to the restaurant. What kind of hoops are you jumping through to get to this conclusion.\n\nIf you really spoke to her brother then her family is dumb as rocks.", "They also forced an immediate, emotional response by blocking in her car. No time to process. It almost feels like they wanted the response so they could try to tell her she's too emotional and overreacting.", "They should still have said no. Simple as that. And I'd argue that, if you're right about her being dramatic, they'd have known that agreeing and then turning up late would've been worse than declining.", "She stormed off because 5 minutes after they were meant to be there they were all still at home and not ready.", "And in my family it's family dinner on the closest weekend. Most of my friends do similar. It's actually not reasonable to assume that OP's family does what yours does.", "And everyone I know celebrates their birthday entirely on the weekend, so it kinda is an unreasonable assumption. There\u2019s no indication that this family does things the same way yours does, and if they don\u2019t, assuming that they should expect to have that day reserved for OP\u2019s birthday is very much unreasonable.", "I need to rewatch this now!!", "How is it rude to invite someone to something? It might be rude to expect them to stop everything but never to invite them. They were pretty rude in being so dismissive and lax in their behaviour.", "OP cried at the thought of her parents being late to her 25th last minute birthday dinner. \n\nDoes she strike you as a person that takes no very well??", "You added a last minute restaurant invite to your already made party plans. And when finding out your family would be a little late you went somewhere to cry. You are 25. You have got to learn to deal with inconveniences a bit better. \n\nThey should have worked harder to be on time but you 1. Disrupted their already made plans 2. Did not try to contact the restaurant about making adjustments to the reservation. 3. It seems you didn\u2019t even tell your family you were cancelling and ignored them. And then 4. You made them have to go look for you. \n\nIn the time that they took to find you, you all could have been seated and enjoying dinner. Or you could have just asked to eat by yourself and celebrated with them later.", "Sounds like it's something that would give a hell of a lot of context for OP's story, then.", "Being effectively stood up and blown off hits differently than discussing it like adults. They also could talk in a call and say \"We're so sorry, we committed to this BBQ. What about tomorrow night/a nice brunch before your party?\"", "As others have pointed out, OP did not even call or talk to the people at the restaurant about it. She just hung up and cried. \n\nThey said they were behind and she basically cancelled and ignored their calls. They had to *go find her!* For all we know, they may have actually made it to the restaurant during the typical 15 minute window but OP went and cried somewhere. \n\nNothing about this situation tells me that OP can handle disappointment. All the way down to the last minute dinner plans."]}
