The most disappointing birthday I\u2019ve ever had. I didn\u2019t make any plans for the actual day because it\u2019s a Wednesday, but planned to throw a party at my house with my friends and family this Saturday. For the actual day I still went to work and everything was normal, but I wanted something simple so I asked my family (mom, dad and brother) the night before to go out to dinner with me at a nice restaurant I\u2019ve been wanting to try. I confirmed a time that would work for everyone and made the reservation for 7:30pm. \n\nMy dad called to wish me a happy birthday and tried to convince me to go to my cousins house, who happened to be throwing a bbq of some sort. I said I\u2019d rather not because I really wanted to try this restaurant and just wanted to celebrate with them, it\u2019d feel really weird for me going to a party of some sort when it happens to be my bday and the attention I would get would be in genuine bc nobody at the bbq realized it was my birthday. My dad says ok no problem. This was a nice restaurant that are very strict with reservations so I looked really nice and arrived right on time.\n\n My mom, who has not acknowledged it was my birthday calls me and says her and my dad are still at the house and need to shower and get ready, but my brother is on the way to meet me there so we should order appetizers. 5 min later my brother calls me and tells me he\u2019s going to be late as well, that he\u2019s also at the house and I should get the table myself. Now I know this restaurant was not going to seat me without my whole party, and after a certain time they\u2019d give the table away. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore so I hung up on my brother, parked at a building near by and cried. I was so upset I declined all his and my moms calls. \n\nAt 8pm 30 min after the reservation, my family pull up behind my car so I can\u2019t back out and surrounds my car. I\u2019m in shock bc I purposely parked at a random building, but forgot my brother has my location on find my friends. So they surround the car, and start talking about what a long day everyone has had and how I should come with them to find a restaurant that will take us. I tell them I\u2019ve been crying, mascara running all down my face and do not want to be out in public or with them. My dad says I don\u2019t look upset and my mom keeps telling me to calm down. They were not understanding that this wasn\u2019t a \u201chaha ok I\u2019m overreacting\u201d situation so I had to basically yell at them that it was too late and to leave me alone. They left and went to my cousins house. I got whattaburger on my way home and ate it myself. I was still so upset I barely slept, and texted the family groupchat they ruined my birthday and I didn\u2019t want them coming to my party Saturday. I\u2019m still so upset this morning.

You asked very little of them - a nice family dinner at a restaurant you were really looking forward to trying - and they treated you like an afterthought, made you lose your reservation, and then didn't even care enough to be apologetic after ruining the only thing you wanted for your birthday. I would have been so hurt if I were you. I'm so sorry they did that.", "NTA. It was very rude of them to brush off your emotions like that. The fact is, they really wanted to go to the cousin's BBQ instead of your birthday dinner, so that's why they tried to get you to go with them. It's also very worrisome to me that a 25yo woman's brother (or any family member) has a locator for her on his phone. They like to keep tabs on you for some bizarre reason, and you need to put a stop to it.", "NTA. That sucked, sorry OP. Are your family chronically late to everything?", "NTA\n\nYour family sucks. This feels like it was always a ploy to go to your cousins BBQ. Also, disable your location, that's actually pretty invasive.\n\nMake your plans next year with friends without your family. They're gonna let you down again", "NTA.  Your parents and brother didn't show up; after showing up like a bunch of clowns they should have been profusely apologetic but instead tried to deflect their sh!tty actions and push you into something that was never going to be celebratory for you.", "NTA it was your birthday they did not care about it in the slightest so you got very sad, and angry when they dismissed your feelings. Completely normal reaction from you.\n\nDo not invite them back to your party. If they will want to make up with you, I think you should give them a chance, but on your terms. You can give them a chance to meet on sth like this again, but they are paying and you can do this when it is convenient time-wise for you.", "My only comment is that you made a reservation 1 day in advance and should have done something sooner.", "I mean.. I get it, but I'm going to say ESH.\n\nBy 25, it's pretty much all birthdays are diminishing till the end. If you wanted to make it a higher priority it should have been communicated much earlier.\nYour family tried to make amends and do the dinner. 30 minutes late by 8pm isn't even that late. I feel you could have still gone to eat but decided it wasn't about the food. Make up aside, it really feels like it was salvageable.\n\nI've had family be hour(s) late. So I took initiative to say we start at 6pm when it's really 7pm. Just depends on how much you want them to be there. But crying after half an hour, refusing to salvage it, and going to group chat is (to me) attention seeking for drama. They shouldn't have been late.", "NTA. You could have been a bit more organised and let people know 'I want to do X' with a bit more notice, but otherwise you made your wants known, everyone agreed and everyone let you down.\n\nWhilst having a but of a meltdown might feel like an overreaction, getting yourself all excited and geared up for something only to realise bit by bit that it's not going to happen, that other people that should have been there have let you down, and especially if there's a feeling of missing an obligation (such as a reservation time) is a huge crash and I don't think it's unreasonable to react emotionally in that state. Especially if you feel that your emotions are being brushed off, which adds fuel to the fire.\n\nIf this is a 1 off, then your family dropped the ball. If this is a habit, they suck and you should not include them in important plans to save yourself getting overwrought.", "NTA", "ESH but mostly you. Your parents and your brother were late to your birthday dinner but they all called and let you know ahead of time that they were going to be late. They should have tried harder to be on time. You on the other hand, You booked a dinner that required reservations the night before the dinner and expected everyone to drop an already planned event and come to your dinner instead. Then when people were late, you tried absolutely nothing to fix the situation whatsoever and went and sat in your car and cried and then threw a temper tantrum for the rest of the evening. Grow up.", "Hmmm. \n\nYTA? \n\n1.) I think you are either very easy to get upset, or there are some key Details missing. Like, why do you have a full meltdown? Is your family abusive? If not, this seems a bit of a ... dramatic Response?\n2.) You have your actual Party on saturday anyways. Basically you wanted kinda like two parties? I would say it is understandable that your family did not think it was a huge deal and wasnt rushing to get there immediatly. \n3.) It was on very short notice as far as i understood.\n4.) They might have had obligations to also show up at the bbq and because of that were late. \n5.) There was miscommunication. Your parents thought you just go in and have a fun start with your brother while they would be coming later. Your brother told you he was late, too, without them knowing it. Coupled with the fact (?) It was on short notice, things can go wrong. \n6.) They wanted to make it up to you. \n7.) You hid from them. Who knows how long they were searching you? They mightve been there since a while, realized their mistake and search for you. \n8.) You are 25. Birthdays are normally tmnit THAT important anymore in that age. You should habe communicated it clearly that it was important to you.\n\nI get your Anger, i really hate it when someone stoods me up, too. And they did some things bad, too. But I think it was a case of sorrt notice and piled on miscommunication.\nInstead of being dramatic and hiding, use your Phone and call them. Tell them you are Loosing the Reservation and make New Plans. Do not break down communications. Maybe you would have gotten an \"your brother also cannot make it in time? Crap. We thought you two couldve just gone in. Sorry honey. We meet at 8 then and find a new restaurant. This one we then go to next week, alright? Love you.\" \n\nOr did is misread something?", "ESH.\n\nSure, your family shouldn\u2019t have been late - that\u2019s rude - but you\u2026 did not have an adult reaction.\n\n1. You made the reservation only the night before, so they had to adjust their plans on very short notice. \n\n2. When they can\u2019t make it on time, you don\u2019t check with the restaurant if they can hold the table, you withdraw somewhere to cry. \n\n3. When your family shows up, you have to be even more dramatic about it, pointing out the fact that you\u2019ve been crying. \n\n4. And then, instead of salvaging the evening you throw a giant temper tantrum. \n\nI mean, it\u2019s your bday and you can cry if you want to and all that, but\u2026 I think you need to seriously have a think about how you deal with inconveniences in life so you don\u2019t fall into pieces every time things don\u2019t go your way. Because this was a lot.", "YTA - talk about over dramatise everything \u2026 yes it\u2019s a pain, and not thoughtful of them but assuming a restaurant you have never been in before won\u2019t seat you, especially when you say it's your birthday and can prove it -  hanging up on the call, sitting on your own sobbing and then yelling at them to force home your dramatic point all sounds utterly exhausting. If this is your usual way of dealing with things when they go wrong i\u2019m not surprised they were a bit taken aback. As it happens you probably were over reacting - and you still are.", "YTA. What an overreaction. You sound dramatic and exhauating.", "YTA.\n\nI don't think YOU understand that this WAS a \"haha OK you're overreacting\" situation. I mean, hey, it's your birthday and you can cry if you want to. But dramatically declining calls? Throwing a tantrum in a parking lot? And the way they surrounded your car tells me they're used to your dramatics, so this is probably normal behavior for you. You're 25 going on 15.\n\nPeople have lives, and your birthday doesn't make the world stop. If ***THIS*** is your worse birthday ever, consider yourself lucky. YOU ruined your birthday. Learn to roll with the punches, you'll be happier for it.", "ESH. The BBQ was probably planned well in advance and your family committed to going. When you issued a day before invitation to the restaurant, they should have said, \"We have already told Cousin Elmo that we would be at the party and he has purchased and started preparing food. It would be rude to not show up. Could we take you out to dinner on another night? Of course we are looking forward to your party on Saturday. \n\nThey were unfair to Cousin Elmo for standing him up, but once they told you they were going to meet you at the restaurant, they were also rude to you. \n\nWere they late because they stopped by the BBQ first, trying to please everyone?", "Esh It\u2019s time for you to grow up", "NTA, but you are being over dramatic", "NAH - It definitely sucks that they were late, you would hope that they would have showered, prepared etc. early to ensure they would make it. But tbh 30 minutes isn\u2019t *that* bad. It\u2019s definitely annoying, and you certainly have ample justification to be frustrated that literally none of them made it on time, but it\u2019s also not so long that I feel like it\u2019s worth having what was basically a meltdown over it. The reality is that we live in the real world where stuff happens and mistakes are made, sometimes people are late, it sucks but it happens. \n\nMeanwhile I don\u2019t want to put you on blast *too* much because I know birthdays have different significance to different people, but all the same I do think your reaction was a tad dramatic for a 25 year old. Especially because you didn\u2019t even *try* to explain and see if the restaurant could hold the table, and when your family tried to offer alternatives and solutions you just cried and shut them down. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for being upset and won\u2019t label you as such, but your reaction was a bit\u2026overdone.\n\nMaybe there\u2019s some extra info that would change my mind, like they have a habit of ignoring/not caring/being late to big events and milestones in your life and this was merely the final straw. But as a one-off this doesn\u2019t really seem like a big deal.", "YTA they were trying to throw you a surprise party.", "INFO: I know the reservation was late, but did they know you wanted to do a dinner in advance?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they were throwing her a surprise party, they wouldn\u2019t have asked her to order appetisers. If she had ordered, would they have arrived at the restaurant and asked her to leave while the food was on the table? Or would they have done it after only eating that? It doesn\u2019t make any sense to think that they were throwing her a surprise party", "This just shows how far strangers will make up a narrative. No they did not throw a god damn surprise party for me I am not close with my cousin at all. This was a high end restaurant, it was packed when I drove by and they do not hold tables.", "It's not uncommon for your immediate family to do a dinner with you on the actual day, and have a friends party on another day regardless if your family is invited. Pretty much every friend I've had has done something similar."]}
