I would agree you were being whip sawed by your husband and his X. It\u2019s a no win game and at 18 and 14? That ship sailed. There is no upside here for plus I am sure your husband will through you under the bus again. Basically have fun see you when the kids are in college is my suggestion. I guarantee you he won\u2019t change from the last time with the guilt complex and the mother will parachute back in to stir the pot if it looks like you are succeeding so I think the advice I would give is run far far away for your sanitity sake  then watch the drama unfold.", "YTA.\n\nTheir mother kidnapped them, to another country, for five years. They were 9 and 13 when that happened. Before that they had lived exclusively with their father and had minimal contact with their mother. Has it even occurred to you that they are traumatized from these events?\n\nThe simple answer is for you to either accept that your husband absolutely has the right to have his kids live in the family home or move out.\n\nBTW, blaming two kids for not contacting their father when their mother literally kidnapped them is beyond ridiculous. What did your husband do to get the kids back in his legal custody during that time?", "NTA.", "You keep saying he can choose between having his kids or having you. Why are you leaving that decision up to him? You obviously don\u2019t like him or his children. You should just leave the marriage and the children are no longer your problem. That\u2019s what you want so just do it.", "NTA. Sounds like their mother is the real asshole here for constantly interfering and then dumping them on you guys whenever it's convenient for her. You have every right to not want to take on that responsibility again, especially since it caused so many problems before. Just make sure to be there for visits and offer support in any way you can without taking them back into your home full time.", "YTA.\n\nIf you don't want to be a stepparent, don't marry someone with children.", "YTA, your husband has children. Accept that or move on. If you make him choose between YOU and HIS CHILDREN, you\u2019re a horrible wife.", "NTA for not wanting them back. YWBTA if you try to interfere or prevent them from coming back to their father. They are his kids, and they should come first in his priorities. Start getting your stuff squared away and be prepared to leave if they do come back.", "Yta, you decided to marry someone with kids and with kids things don't always go smooth, I understand what you are feeling but that's what you sign up for.", "Seeing your responses to people, you only want validation you are right and you aren\u2019t. Those kids are likely already confused and if bio dad   Wants them to live with him, that is the choice you made when you married someone with kids, your husband and those kids  don\u2019t deserve your negligent and hateful behavior.", "ESH (The adults only) \n\nAll I can think of is these poor children and how all the adults in their lives are just awful,  I mean did your husband even fight to see them when they were taken to another country and were out of contact for 5 years? Sounds like their mother is not mentally stable. \n\nYou keep mentioning in the comments that the children were poorly behaved. Yeah, that's what happens when everyone around them is the same way. They have had a traumatic upbringing and you all are failing them.", "Info: Do you still live with their father?\n\nIf so there's a legal obligation to shelter the 14 yo at least, so YTA for wanting to render a child homeless.", "YTA. Don\u2019t interfere with their relationship with their dad. If you can\u2019t handle them, leave him. But they need and deserve his care. EDIT NTA!!", "Yta I hope that your husband opens his eyes to your rudeness and leaves you. You shouldn\u2019t have married him in the first place if you don\u2019t like his kids.", "It\u2019s actually a complicated situation. The mother is talking about \u201csending them back to us\u201d because she doesn\u2019t want to deal with them. When we had custody of the kids all she did was drag us to court and cause problems telling the kids we are bad and don\u2019t listen to your step mom\u2019s rules and made our lives miserable. She took them and spoiled them and now their grades are crap. It complicated but she can\u2019t just \u201cgive them back\u201d for reasons I won\u2019t go into, we would have to agree to have the kid back and frankly I don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m fine with a relationship and apr eating time but I don\u2019t want to go through all that again. I did it once and their bio father didn\u2019t appreciate it or me and it caused a ton of conflict.", "That depends on who you ask. In our country, he does, but in her country where she and the kids live, she has legal custody. Also she can\u2019t just send them to our country easily due to the legal problems she created when she took them.", "Well he can sell our family home and move out too then because no way I am going back to that absolute hell of living with his children. They didn\u2019t behave well before and I doubt after years of spoiling and neglect from their mother that they will be any better. And yes they had a phone and could have contacted him once he was 18. Their mother caused too many legal problems for us with CPS and the courts. Over 30k and of course she didn\u2019t pay a penny in child support.", "I was fine being a step parent but after what their mother put us through and now raised the kids causing more problems I don\u2019t want to go through it again. We fought enough over the kids because neither their bio mom or dad know how to parent.", "OP never said that she didnt accept that her husband had kids\u2026 she just didnt want the responsibility full time because it caused stress, and that is very understandable for her.", "Well he\u2019s going to have to choose. I\u2019m not doing it again. I did it once and he didn\u2019t give me proper respect and made life horrible over them. He can choose. He\u2019s free to have a relationship with them and everything but I\u2019m not living with them full time again and raising them. He refuses to enforce rules and doesn\u2019t want me to have any. So nope.", "Looks like im a horrible wife then because no way im doing that again.", "It\u2019s beyond that. Not going smooth I can accept. Their mother undermined us at every turn, offered zero support and bailed on them completely. She saw them twice in 4 years and all she did was tell them not to listen to me and to do bad things to me and what to say to teachers and counselors to \u201cget me in trouble\u201d.", "I was actually trying to correct that and give them stability when we had them. Their father was neglectful and indulgent. Kids need rules and boundaries as much as they need love, care, and support. Father would lose his mind at any consequence I gave but had me doing all the childcare. I can\u2019t care about this again and go through this again.", "She won\u2019t be homeless, she lives with her mother in another country. The mother dumped the kudos on us then changed her mind and took them and now wants to dump them again. All she did was cause legal problems for us and call CPS. I don\u2019t want to do this again.", "Well they can have his care but I don\u2019t want to have them full time again. After last time the mother just made problems and called CPS and took us to court costing over 30k over those 4 years. I was find accepting children initially but after all that and she took them I don\u2019t want to live with them again and deal with all these problems.", "I was fine with kids until their father displayed zero parenting and wanted me to step in as their mother but have no authority at the same time. Consequences were not permitted for kids and that doesn\u2019t fly with me. If I didn\u2019t have a kid with him I would have been gone fast.", "Again both you and the father don't have to take the 18 year old he's legally an adult. Now I'm not to versed on custody laws but I would go to court if you can about the 14 year old", "NTA. You say you don\u2019t want them in \u2018my\u2019 home, but it\u2019s their father\u2019s home too. You can certainly express that you don\u2019t want them to live with you but if he decides to take them in, you\u2019ll have to decide if you want to stay with him. If they arrive in your country, where he has legally custody, he\u2019s legally obliged to take in the 14-year-old, at least.", "Why did you post in here if you\u2019ve already decided you\u2019re not the AH? Which you are btw, YTA.", "He cannot leave his minor child homeless because you desire it. Period. He can't just have visits. He has a child who needs to be raised. You have no idea what they have been through, what they were told, etc and you are blaming them for what their mother did. \n\nYou speak about his children terribly and seem happy that they were neglected and traumatized by their mother. \n\nYour husband needs get his kids and work to get a divorce as soon as possible. And if you have kids together, he needs to file for full custody of them as well. He obvious has something broken in his choice of partner meter.", "Your husband cannot leave his children to be homeless. \n\nYou married someone with children, if you had so many issues, you shouldn't have married your husband.", "That is a lot of shade being thrown by you towards your husband when you are the one making terrible comments about children.", "Wow.\n\nYou're awful.", "Thank you! I would have been fine having them full time I\u2019d their father agreed to consequences and some rules but he is an indulgent and neglectful parent who wanted me to do all the childcare but not have any authority in the house with the kids. I did a lot for them when they were here but I also required them to complete their homework (he wasn\u2019t requiring that) and not to write on walls or destroy things. If something was destroyed they had to clean it or fix it and then the item might be taken away or only allowed to be played with under supervision (like paint and stuff). He would LOSE HIS MIND about my consequences saying I was making them unhappy.", "If her mother doesn't take her back and neither do you, it's a possibility that she will be homeless.", "Is she in the picture?", "It\u2019s hard to explain but suffice to say she can\u2019t send the child to us without us agreeing due to her current legal issues.", "Well, for reasons I don\u2019t want to get into, she can\u2019t just \u201carrive\u201d here. He would have to accept it for reasons I don\u2019t want to explain. I know it\u2019s their fathers home too and technically you are right if he took them in I could choose to leave but if you knew what happened those 4 years and how ridiculous he was I think you might see why I don\u2019t want to do it again.", "Because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the AH because their father is unreasonable.", "He can go do that, no one stopping him. No one will be homeless, she lives with her mother. Her mother didn\u2019t leave her on the street. And I\u2019m not blaming them I am blaming their father and mother. If he wants to live full time with his kids he is free to do that but I absolutely won\u2019t do that again after all that has happened.", "Well I obviously didn\u2019t know about the issues. When we dated the mom had the kids and then a few months before we married she dumped them on him and left the country. \n\nThey are not homeless they live in another country with their mother. She isn\u2019t kicking them out just is asking us to take them back. It\u2019s not good for them to move countries every 4 years which is basically what has been happening.", "Maybe if you had lived the 4 years I did you might understand how I feel.", "Why don\u2019t you live my life then and see how long you last.", "The mother HAS THEM and is NOT throwing them out of the house. She is ASKING if we will take custody of her and also have the older one live with us. No one is homeless.", "She currently has the kids living with her full time after she took them against a court order. She consistently told the children not to listen to us, saw them twice in the 4 years we had them, gave zero child support, and undermined us every chance she got. I\u2019m fine with kids visiting and him supporting his kids and having a relationship but I don\u2019t want one at this point. Their father didn\u2019t help the situation for 4 years arguing against having any sort of rules because he felt guilty they didn\u2019t have a mother. I get that and they were in counseling for that but kids need structure and rules just as much  as they need love, care, and support. I can\u2019t deal with the odd sensitivity their father has with them having any sort of rules and expectations.", "Ok then does the father want to take the child in?", "The point being, so you knew the kids were going to stay with you before you got married? \n\nYou still chose to marry this guy, that's on you and nobody else. Once you enter into a marriage with step-kids involved, you cannot really shrug off the responsibility.", "You had four years to get a divorce. There is no excuse. You chose to stay. The kids are the ones who suffered the most and you don't care one bit about that.", "So leave him. He's their father and their mother is clearly unfit.", "What if she refuses to TAKE THEM once you decline their custody? The child still remains ABANDONED?", "Oh I get it now. Yeah I change my answer. NTA! Insist on family therapy if they come back in your lives. This sounds like it\u2019s going to be a nightmare; good luck!!!", "He asked me what I thought about taking them in. I told him I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea given how it went in the past and that they should live primarily with their mother and they can visit us on holiday breaks and summer. Kids live thousands of miles away so it\u2019s not like we can do 50/50 time. We fought so much before about rules and fairness. If he expected me to treat them as mine and be a mother to them with all the responsibilities he should have also given me the authority that goes with that. Instead everything was scrutinized and criticized and I was always accused of something.", "Yes but I was deceived and outright lied to by him. If he was reasonable I wouldn\u2019t have a problem with it but I don\u2019t his sensitivity towards kids and inability to set rules and if I do then he will freak out and say I\u2019m making them unhappy. But at the same time I will be doing all the work as a SAHM while he is at work.", "4 years to get a divorce, why? Why would I? Kids were gone and arguments stopped. I care about myself too and what I went through for 4 years being criticize and the sensitivity and arguments with a father who refused any sort of rules or expectations to be placed on his children. He can go file, I\u2019m not living that nightmare again.", "So is he.", "It\u2019s not a formal thing. She didn\u2019t abandon the children. She has the children at her house. If we refuse to take them she will just keep them. They aren\u2019t abandon. I don\u2019t know where you are getting that from.", "I\u2019m up for family therapy and if things can get resolved for then to live with us. But I don\u2019t think that just abruptly changing homes again (and countries) makes sense.", "Yeah Nta your right if he had certain expectations he should've told you", "Again if you realised you were deceived by him, why did you choose to stay in this marriage?", "The entire time they lived with you, not the five years since. You had that entire time to leave and chose not to. You chose to live with your husband despite there supposedly being no rules or expectations. Now you want your husband but want zero to do with his children. Hopefully he files as soon as possible so he can at least rescue his younger child. His kids need him more than he needs you.", "Divorce your husband. He deserves better. Blaming the children for the arguments between you and your spouse is pathetic. Not his fault that his ex was a menace and kidnapped his children. It's not their fault their mother instigated them against you. Children are gullible too, it can be easy to influence them. \n\n\nYou have the audacity to render a child homeless because you don't want your husband to take responsibility? How insanely inhuman of you. You are no better than their bio-mother. \n\n\nGet the entire family including yourself into family therapy. That is the only thing that can help those kids.", "You\u2019re exactly right. I hope you get some help, too, because being a support system has got to be so draining and frustrating.", "I was actually fine taking in the responsibility. But every single time someone wasn\u2019t happy he blamed me and argued and lost his mind. For example, one of the kids wrote on the door. My response was the make the child clean it and now markers were in the kitchen and used under supervision. This was when the kid was 7. He lost his mind about how I disciplined saying it was normal for 7 year olds to write on stuff and it\u2019s not a big deal. We disagreed a lot.", "I was already pregnant and I have no family support so it was tough. I didn\u2019t fully realize his lies and behavior until I had given brith and my kid was 1. Honestly I was trapped financially and had no means to leave.", "Oh no you don\u2019t realize there were rules. I put them in place and children got better grades, better nutrition, and better behavior. If he wants to file he can go file He fought me too much over them and criticized me constantly over every little thing. He is a lazy incompetent parent who is a mix of indulgent and neglectful. I\u2019m not living with problems.", "No one blamed the children. I blame him for how he handled things in a step family. He dumped all responsibility on me then criticized everything I did. I\u2019m not doing that again. And is everyone here deficient?  Kids aren\u2019t homeless they live with their bio mother, she isn\u2019t kicked them out just asking us to take them back. Kids keep moving countries and school, that\u2019s not good and one of them is 18 anyway.", "Thank you! At least someone understands. And I do see a counselor after all that happened. I\u2019ve brought it up with him and he understands why I am hesitant.", "Why are you with him then? If he is such a lazy incompetent human and a parent, then why do you still want him as your husband?", "What does your partner want to do?", "He isn\u2019t sure but he wasn\u2019t happy with my initial response. I know he wants them back living with us and wants this happy family but it wasn\u2019t happy when they were here and I don\u2019t want everyone miserable again because everyone was miserable before."]}
