This person is a moocher and you offered a solution. \n\nThey didn't like the solution (even though it was actually the best option) \n\nYour friends have been consistently bailing this person out, so why would they change?\n\nYou ALL need to stop buying this person meals and, if you REALLY feel the need to, offer to help them get some groceries to make food or just STOP assisting them. \n\nTrust me, give it one pay cycle and they'll learn to stop burning all their money.", "NTA; direct them to the nearest food pantry.
