However, they are being very unfair to you by overlooking you. It's kind of like when a family has a toddler and then a newborn. While obviously the newborn needs 100% care, the toddler also has very specific needs and shouldn't be overlooked. I'm sorry your parents have been grossly neglecting you.\n\nNTA, unfortunately I don't think it's going to change.

They embarrassed themselves, not you.", "NTA and I am sorry that this has happened to you.

People didn't see what I was going through because of it, or maybe just chose not to see it, and it definitely has messed me up a bit as an adult who still struggles with that and has to hear \"Oh we never knew, I wish you'd said something\" from adults in my life who I feel just weren't paying attention.", "Honestly can you stay with your grandparents?", "So basically your parents have cut you off from your entire extended family because working with your siblings is challenging.", "Now that you are older, would it be worth approaching other family and asking if you could join them for Christmas, without your parents and siblings?

Aside from the crappy presents, your childhood has been adversely impacted by severe neglect and I\u2019m assuming a lot of parentification. You being autistic helped them get away with this, but now that you\u2019re older and are understanding it more it\u2019s time to get into a better living situation.", "That was my second thought. \n\nFWIW, family friends had a daughter with no disabilities. They then had a son who had SEVERE mental and emotional disabilties, to the point that he was in in-patient psychiatric care 10 times by the age of eight.\n\nWhat does this couple do? They decide, very deliberately, to have a third child. WHY? WHY? WHY?\n\nWell, the third child also has serious mental health issues, not as serious as the second child, but ones that still deeply affect his life and his parents' lives.\n\nThe upshot of all of it? Friends are now divorced. Their daughter pretty much ignores them as she was ignored for much of her upbringing. The mother is living \"the single life\" trying to regain her lost youth at the age of 50. And the father is trying, desperately, to hold this whole shitshow together somehow and get his two sons to some kind of independent lives (which may or may not happen).\n\nNo one won here.", " Unless you have a sweet tooth I'd bet everything you got was either a regift from friends/coworkers or from a sales bin. \n\nIf you only received one gift for something that held interest to you, it probably would have overridden the sting.\n\nI'm not saying your parents don't love you, but time away from them might refresh you, so you can focus less on the difference in treatment. I understand not everyone has that privilege tho.\n\nDon't let them make you feel bad for feeling like you do", "So they claim cardboard boxes would be fine for you but at the same time they insist you need to be prepared for the real world. Which is it, do they expect you to remain a kid or to be forced to grow up fast? NTA", "How often do you have to \"make do\" on your needs and wants because your parents don't have time or energy to deal with them?  Because this seems like a typical not atypical situation for you.  \n\nDid you learn \"independence\" at an early age?  Making your own food(even if it was a sandwich that doesn't need cooking).  Staying in your room, playing quietly by yourself?  \n\nHow much help do you give your parents with your sibling's care?", "Omg I know that. \ud83d\ude02 But you can\u2019t tell those differences when you\u2019re talking about a 19 year old who\u2019s mentally delayed. Or do you mean to tell me op\u2019s 19 year old couldn\u2019t even walk until maybe recently? Seriously.\n\nYou know, it\u2019s funny. You may know the differences between 1 year olds, 18 month olds and 2 year olds (like I do) but you certainly don\u2019t possess the appropriate intellectual logical skills to apply those differences into a mentally delayed young adult. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have given me such a simplistic and useless answer and assumed I didn\u2019t know the differences when in reality you couldn\u2019t even grasp the very simple logical connection I was making. I guess it\u2019s not a big deal but I just hate it when people do that. I hate it when they\u2019re not intelligent enough but can\u2019t see it so they make it my problem. Ugh.\n\nAnd it\u2019s funny too that the *only* difference you could think of was the walking which is motor skills and therefore not even relevant in this particular example. Honestly, please, don\u2019t waste my time with your low capacity intellect.", "Fuck! Now that you say that, that\u2019s exactly what these parents did, isn\u2019t it? Bred a servant. \n\nOP, you\u2019re a good person who deserves a good life. Get away from home as soon as you can. You deserve the world.", "First thing that occurred to me but I wouldn\u2019t want OP not to exist. Made me wonder if they had the second child as a caretaker for the first and when that didn\u2019t work out they tried one more time. There\u2019s some cynicism/bitterness about life in their comment to OP.", "Agree. Sometimes it\u2019s not about the gift, it\u2019s merely knowing that someone took the time, thought and effort to get something for you. There was none of that. All the thought and effort went to siblings, and the monetary discrepancy between what she got and what her siblings got sure didn\u2019t help matters.", "So, OP can at least save the \"oh, they'd be happy with a cardboard box\" for when they are making final arrangements? \n\nI'm sorry you went through that.", ">That's only counting the cost of the room conversion.  \n>  \n>Don't forget IPad-anywhere from $399(2021) to over $1000(2023).  \n>  \n><<*They also got some new toys, and Joanne got a new ipad because apparently she needs two at a time now*.>>  \n>  \n>So add another 1-2k probably to their gifts total.", "What do you mean I missed your point. Your point was $15 was the least they could\u2019ve done and my point was that is offensive and ridiculous. What did I miss about it? Why would you just throw it out there like that because you didn\u2019t like that I strongly disagreed with you? Come on, don\u2019t be so childish. It\u2019s bad enough you think a $15 gift card is a remotely acceptable Christmas gift but now you actually have to pretend I \u201cmissed your point\u201d like a child because you didn\u2019t like that I disagreed with you. Must be fun talking to someone like you who has these absolute golden responses at the tip of their tongue. Dear god. Seriously.", "Well of course not! This is Christmas! Oscillating fans are only for graduation!", "That's unfortunately true with being the youngest. A lot of times there is parent fatigue. They use up all their parenting and then don't care to parent the youngest which often alienates them.", "I've said this upthread somewhere so apologies for duplication. But it could also be ableism. Yes OP has lower support needs than her siblings, but her parents may still infantilise her because of her autism. \n\nThere's something about the patronising comment and then her paternal grandparents getting her a toddler toy that makes me wonder if they think \"well she doesn't know any better because of her autism\" rather than respecting her as an individual with needs (a strong need being autonomy)! \n\nIt's quite common for parents of autistic people to identify themselves as \"autism mom/dads\" as a way of garnering attention but then to be ridiculously ableist towards actually autistic people.\n\nI do think your comment is likely correct but I think ableism may be another ingredient in this 'soup' of issues. I really hope OP has the means and support to leave home as soon as she is legally able to because this environment is unhealthy for her, especially as someone who has to have the latitude to figure out what works for her individually in order to become as independent as she possibly can.", "My favorite thing about that post was the thread of people of different cultures assuring everyone else that no an oscillating fan is definitely not some sort of cultural gift.", "I missed that. What\u2019s this about an oscillating fan people talked about here?", "I loved that part too!", "I've never actually shared a link on here before, so I hope this works. \n\n[Fan Story](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheDevil/comments/vze7n9/its_the_fan_for_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)", "Ooohhh it\u2019s from a different post? Oh cool! And it works! Thanks!"]}
