However, they are being very unfair to you by overlooking you. It's kind of like when a family has a toddler and then a newborn. While obviously the newborn needs 100% care, the toddler also has very specific needs and shouldn't be overlooked. I'm sorry your parents have been grossly neglecting you.\n\nNTA, unfortunately I don't think it's going to change. Just be careful that your parents don't make you the legal guardian or caretaker for your siblings. \n\n(Is it possible for you to move in with your grandparents?)", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this OP.

The fact they got you something you can't even use..Jesus", "NTA, and it sounds like your maternal grandparents see what's going on. It could be that your parents are genuinely so taxed by 24 years of tough parenting that they've allowed themselves to focus their attention on the two who \"need\" them most and weren't actually trying to treat you as less, but they need to remember that they have three children, not two. It sounds like you actually handled it really well, not even bringing it up until they asked. NTA at all for honestly explaining your feelings at that point. They embarrassed themselves, not you.", "NTA and I am sorry that this has happened to you. The holidays are supposed to be filled with great memories.\n\nAlthough Christmas is not supposed to be about what you get for gifts, I can totally understand your disappointment. When a poorly thought out gift is given by someone close to you, and a fraction of what is given to a sibling, that's something that will stick with you for a while.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this scenario, and your salt is warranted.", "Nta.

It happens a lot, that the \"normal\" kid gets lost in the shuffle of taking care of the special needs kid(s).  Your parents being mad at you is dumb, though.  Your grandparents asked what you got and you told them.  THEY went to your parents, you didn't ask them to.  Your parents are mad they got called out by mom's parents (even as adults, no one likes to be called out by mom and dad), they're just taking it out on you.", "Overall, NTA.

They could have involved you in some way in the big gift.", "NTA, but I have an INFO request too.\n\nIf this post were just 'my siblings got better gifts than I did for Christmas by an actual order of magnitude' then it would be ESH, but the underlying issue is that your parents are used to your siblings needing all the attention, time and resources, and what you're really saying is that hurts, and you deserve equal resources and attention and time. Yeah, you do. \n\nINFO: What is up with the cardboard box comment? Do you have any more detail as to why they'd say something like that?", "NTA. it sounds like you have been plenty understanding to your siblings and it is true that they require more care and attention, but your parents should understand your feelings of unfairness, instead of asking you to get over it.

Because that sounds to me like your parents just kept on digging that hole they were in as far as your mom's parents were concerned.", "NTA\n\nYou are entitled to feel you deserve a fair treatment from your parents. \n\nNot necessarily _equal_, it's clear that your siblings require more time and attention attention, but *fair*.\n\nBy their reaction, I guess your parents also know, though. They just probably feel overwhelmed and don't want to admit it.", "NTA\n\nAnd don\u2019t let your parents guilt you into being a carer for your siblings when they get too old.", "I'm so sorry, OP. I know what it feels like to have special needs siblings take priority, and it's not a fun situation to be in.

It's not the present. It's the lack of thought.

Obviously they have a lot on their plates, but this sounds like they've altogether given up trying to be good parents to you, which makes me very sad for you.

I work with the adult autistic/ developmentally disabled population. I can say that it\u2019s very common for NT siblings to feel neglected or ignored because their sibling needs all of the attention. The NT sibling often feels guilty for those feelings because they understand that their sibling does need more help. And \u201chigh functioning\u201d autistic people have a hard time getting resources or accommodations they need if they learned how to mask \u201ctoo well\u201d as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve experienced.

But they can't forget about their youngest child who deserves attention and enrichment as well.", "NTA - FUCK OP i'm sorry this is your reality. Your grandparents were right to defend you and your parents have no idea who you really if they said you'd be happy with a cardboard box. To be quite frank, I would find that very insulting. And while that is a common term, I'm surprised they used that kind of language considering their children.\n\nMy little brother is disabled, in a way. Just major leaning disabilities that lent themselves to behavioral issues in turn. I have some HIGH LEVEL ADHD but am like you, neurotypical passing. For the most part. \n\nI too felt like I was overlooked in those situations. While your siblings do need extra special care, you need care too, OP.\n\nOP, also know, from one \"higher functioning\" sibling to another, you're not ungrateful, you're not spoiled. You need care and attention too and you're right to be upset about not receiving any of that.", "NTA, your grandparents asked and you answered. Were you supposed to lie?", "NTA and not your fault your parents were embarrassed by your truthful answer to your grandparents (who reacted appropriately imo).\n\nThe communication about you and to you is terrible. It sounds like your parents have little understanding of your likes and capabilities. I'm really sorry you're being treated like this.\n\nBTW I totally understand if financial pressures meant they couldn't do a big present for you right now. If that was the case they should have sat you down, explained the situation and maybe come up with some inexpensive experience type gifts instead. They could spend their time and be thoughtful and creative given the expense and time they've put towards your siblings.", "NTA, simply because they didn't even try. I am raising a very autistic child, so I know how exhausting the care can sometimes be, but you deserve to be acknowledged as well. They know they did wrong by you, otherwise they would not be embarrassed by it.", "NTA.\n\nYour grandparents asked you what your parents got you for Christmas, and you answered them.
