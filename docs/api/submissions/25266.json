This will definitely get the conversation started. \n\nIf this continues, notify the landlord that a 3rd person is residing there who\u2019s name is not on the lease.

Check the lease agreement. Roommate is probably breaking it by essentially importing his SO as a third roommate. The landlord wouldn't like that.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your roommate need to have a chat about this. It's extremely disrespectful.\n\nAnd if she's there that often, taking up utilities, then he needs to pay a higher portion of the rent to account for that. You shouldn't have to pay for her pop-tarts and bubble baths.\n\nI really can't fathom how people operate like this. Sure, I've been alone at the place of someone I was dating before, but I'd always check in with the roommates to make sure I wasn't being intrusive and if I was, I'd vacate.

They need to severely limit her visits or she needs to pay 33%. Why are you essentially paying for her to live there? They don't seem to respect you so you may need to move out if possible. Telling your landlord may be another option if they refuse to listen/compromise.", "NTA- She shouldn't be there if he isn't with her. You pay rent, she doesn't.", "I don\u2019t think they care. The first time i spoke to him about this he suggested leaving her in his room so i wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. I was like what?!", "That\u2019s the thing though, i don\u2019t want a 3rd roommate. I didn\u2019t sign up for this", "Time to start making her as uncomfortable as possible.", "It\u2019s your home, it\u2019s fair to request that your roommates guests leave when they do.\n\nHowever if they have a partner and you don\u2019t want them there, this will likely end someone moving out. As the roommate won\u2019t be giving up a partner for the comfort of their roommate, sadly the way things were will be unlikely to come back.\n\nI would request a meeting with your roommate to discuss the house guest situation , and what you are comfortable with and get them to agree to a max number of sleepovers per week, and time in your place when they are not there. (Ie It\u2019s fine if you are running to the store, but not for them to spend the day there alone) do you own the house? Or do you have a landlord and lease? As there is usually a clause about houseguests in standard leases and rental agreements.\n\nTough situation, just be nice about it but firm."]}
