I wish it would just die. \n\nI think the way it's been handled is stupid. What are we even trying to do here? \"Reclaim\" the word.

Now it's a whole community of people, who proudly use the word. They bonded together over it's use and changed it to signify something positive. That's reclaimation. Also they don't try to say \"straight people can't use the word,\" because that's RIDICULOUS. \n\nNo other community has done this with their racial slur.

There is no world where you can convince me it makes sense for any community to try and normalize a word, and then go *surprise Pikachu face* when it's been normalized.
