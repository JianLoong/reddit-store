I am curious why this is suddenly such a big issue for him..", "NTA and tell him that you will have it removed after he has the lower part of this left ear trimmed off because it annoys you with how it has that weird contour and you have to look at it all the time and he never does.

I'm assuming he was aware of this when you were dating, when he proposed and then when you got married. It's suspicious that suddenly he wants you to remove it now. In any event, this is something you should do for yourself, not another person, if you want to. \n\nI would question though if there is something larger at play. Hopefully you can get to the root of the issue.", "Wow, your husband sounds a delightful man! \n\nNTA and don't get it removed. How 'unsightly' you are should be entirely based on what you see in the mirror, not what someone else sees.", "NTA.

I\u2019m just wondering why it\u2019s suddenly a problem.", "NTA. Your husband is being unreasonable and insensitive by demanding that you remove a small skin tag on your nose that you've had most of your life. Your appearance is your own, and it's not fair for your husband to make demands about how you choose to look.  \nIt's understandable to want to look good for your partner, but it's also important to maintain your autonomy and not feel pressured to change something about yourself that you're comfortable with. If your husband truly loves and respects you, he should accept you for who you are, including any physical features that make you unique.  \nIt's worth having a conversation with your husband about why this is important to you, and how it makes you feel when he criticizes your appearance. Perhaps there's an underlying issue that he's not expressing, or maybe he's just being shallow and needs to be reminded that beauty, for both of you, will only fade as you age. Either way, it's important to stand your ground and not let anyone else dictate how you should look.", "NTA, it sounds like he just found something to pick at you about. This is not the yogurt you think it is", "NTA\n\nif he has a problem with looking at that skin tag, you should ask him which other problems he has with you.", "NTA. This is a huge red flag. If you have had it most of your life presumably since he has known you than there must be some reason why all of the sudden he has a problem with the way you look. I would start paying attention to what he is comparing you too.", "Your husband is not being nice. This isn't a new or potentialcancerous growth. And your body, your choice.  He married you. If he is this superficial all the sudden then something else is going on with him. But only you get to decide what happens with your body. \n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA, but your husband certainly is. This feels like a slippery slope like you mentioned, he could ask you to make other changes to your appearance in the future if you get the skin tag removed. If you haven't yet, find out from him what brought this on. He dated you and MARRIED you without mentioning it, why is it a problem now?? If he wants to make demands about your appearance, the least he can do is cough up the reason he asked in the first place.", "NTA.", "NTA. Is this really just about the skin tag?", "NTA\n\nIt is \\* your \\* body, and if \\* you \\* are happy with how you look, that is ALL that matters. The audacity this man has to think he can dictate a body that isn't his own.", "NTA. I'd rather cut the husband off than cut something off my body that I didn't want to. He sounds mean.", "NTA", "NTA. I think you should name the skin tag. Then when he brings it up, say, \"Nellie? Why, she's been with Me all my life. She's in our wedding pictures! I'd be lost without my dear Nellie!\"", "Why wouldn't you remove it? The dermatologist can do it very quickly. I feel like if the roles were reversed, and the wife wanted her husband to remove his blemish this wouldn't be so controversial. Just remove it.\nSlight YTA", "NTA and I'm wondering why this is a problem *now* when it never was before. Did he just get a really posh job where everyone has a trophy wife? Is he having an affair and it's making him more irritable with you overall? I think you need to ask him why it's suddenly an issue.\n\nYou're going to get some comments like \"He can't help what he's attracted to!!!\"--but he was before, so what's up now?", "NTA But a dermatologist can remove that very easily", "Not going to give a judgement - it's your body - but I will say that sometimes we need people we're close to tell us hard truths about how we are in the world and what needs addressing.
