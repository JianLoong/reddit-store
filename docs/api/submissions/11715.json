Your husband is being unreasonable and insensitive by demanding that you remove a small skin tag on your nose that you've had most of your life. Your appearance is your own, and it's not fair for your husband to make demands about how you choose to look.  \nIt's understandable to want to look good for your partner, but it's also important to maintain your autonomy and not feel pressured to change something about yourself that you're comfortable with. If your husband truly loves and respects you, he should accept you for who you are, including any physical features that make you unique.  \nIt's worth having a conversation with your husband about why this is important to you, and how it makes you feel when he criticizes your appearance. Perhaps there's an underlying issue that he's not expressing, or maybe he's just being shallow and needs to be reminded that beauty, for both of you, will only fade as you age.
