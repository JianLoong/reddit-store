{"id": 33851, "submission_id": "18s52q1", "title": "AITA for insisting that my stepdaughter drive my daughter to her friends\u2019 house because her dad bought her a car?", "selftext": "My (42M) wife (39F) had a daughter, \u201cSophie\u201d, with her ex. She is now 17. I have a 11 year old daughter with my late wife. My wife and I have been together for 3 years. My wife is very kind to my daughter and they are quite close. My daughter has very little memory of her mom and has told me how nice it is to feel like she has a mom now. My wife is also happy to play that role in my daughter\u2019s life. I\u2019m not as close to Sophie, because she\u2019s older and she spends  two weeks a month at her dad\u2019s place. But she\u2019s polite to me and I think she\u2019s a wonderful girl. \n\nSophie\u2019s dad is pretty well off, my wife and I are less so. He was the main earner before my wife left him. My wife and I both work full time, but we have to be careful with our finances right now. We got my daughter a few books and Sophie a dress for Christmas. Both of them liked their presents. Sophie\u2019s dad got Sophie a brand new car. We have only one car in the family right now, I drop my wife off on the way to work in the mornings, so it works out. But it does mean that I couldn\u2019t take my daughter or Sophie anywhere during the holidays, as my wife still has to work. I have the week off because I\u2019m a teacher. (She did have a few days off though.) \n\nNow that Sophie has the car, she is planning to go to her friends\u2019 New Years party. My daughter asked if Sophie could drop her at her friends\u2019 house too, and Sophie said it\u2019s too far out of the way (extra half an hour approx) and it\u2019s her car, so my daughter can wait until she\u2019s old enough to drive. I thought this was uncalled for, so I said Sophie was being rude and she should drop my daughter. She said it\u2019s not her fault I can\u2019t afford another car for us. \n\nMy wife said I should just let it go, because my daughter has a dad all the time and Sophie only has one half the time, and a car is fair compensation (not the right word, but I can\u2019t think of a better one) for that. My daughter and Sophie are both upset now - AITA?\n\nEdit: I suppose you are right, it\u2019s her car, she can do what she wants. I just thought it wouldn\u2019t hurt her to think of others this time. My daughter asked very politely and Sophie often has much nicer things than my daughter and I\u2019ve never asked her to share or anything. And I pay for all her gas while she lives with us. \n\nEdit again: 30 mins extra means 15 mins out of the way, 30 mins total. An hour is a lot of extra driving, I agree. I can\u2019t reply to comments because of the poo mode, so editing here. To the person who said ask nicely - my daughter asked very nicely and Sophie literally said I don\u2019t have to do anything for you. That\u2019s why I said she was being rude. I\u2019m not forcing her, I just said I think she should. To the person who asked if I broke up their family - Sophie\u2019s dad cheated on my wife, twice. So maybe\u2026 think before you speak? I might be wrong here but there\u2019s no reason to overreact.

I think you need to keep in mind that Sophie just got this car. It\u2019s her new thing, an important resource and a significant jolt for her mobility, and almost right away she\u2019s getting pushed to use it for someone else. That\u2019s likely to feel really grabby to her, even if phrased nicely, which may explain why her response was rude. Driving someone else also cuts into her freedom or at least her sense of it. And because she only just got the car, the issue of you paying for gas for it hasn\u2019t really become a significant thing for her.\n\nSo back off, you and your daughter. Let Sophie enjoy her car, her new present from her father, and make sure that when you do ask for driving favours from her, they\u2019re few, short, and asked for reasonably. You need to show her that this isn\u2019t going to turn into her car (and her as driver) being used as a family resource, and such a quick demand doesn\u2019t make her feel secure about that.", "It's not your place to boss your half-month stepdaughter.

In some, drivers aren\u2019t allowed passenger (other than adults) if they are under an age limit. Plus, is the car insured under her father? How does that policy read?", "An extra half an hour? Yeah, that's pretty out of the way. It's reasonable to say \"no\" in this situation. This whole drama was unnecessary. YTA.", "YTA for insisting.

With time, maybe Sophie can receive extra money for driving the youngest if she agrees. Mom should negotiate this though, because it's Sophies car and she can ultimately decide who she drives and where. \nThe car is still new, give Sophie some time to get used to her new freedom.

You signed up to have a daughter, but Sophie didn't sign up to have a younger sister, so it is your responsibility to take care of her, not Sophie's. Of course Sophie needs to be polite and nice to her sister, but she shouldn't be required to do parent things like giving rides. If you try to force the issue, she might just come to resent her sister, which would be awful for everyone!\n\nBut it definitely makes sense why Sophie giving the ride seems like the best (and in fact, only possible) solution. In cases like this, I would usually suggest paying the older sibling a rate that is below that of a professional babysitter or uber driver, but still enough to feel like an actual paying job.\n\nBut, since your finances are tight, maybe you could work out a trade instead? Like, you'll do all of Sophie's chores for a day in return (or even younger sis does them, or the rest of the family working together), or you run an errand for Sophie some time when she otherwise would've had to drive herself, or you'll cook her favorite meal the day before, etc; since driving her younger sister around should be treated as a favor to her/you, you should offer Sophie a favor in return to show that you understand it's an imposition and appreciate her help. This can really help strengthen your relationship and show that you respect her as a near-adult!\n\n(If you'd bought Sophie the car on the condition that she use it to give her sister rides, that would be one thing, but that's obviously not the case here. The car is Sophie's, not yours, no matter how badly your household needs a second car.)\n\nEDIT: seeing your edit, I would suggest you make your paying for Sophie's gas be contingent upon her occasionally driving your daughter places. one favor in return for another.", "NAH Older siblings are often asked (or made) to drive their siblings places and no one bats an eye. The difference here is that these are stepsiblings. Yes, it would have been nice if Sophie agreed, but...she doesn't have to. A cynic would point out that you pay her room and board, food and likely do errands for her free of charge, but this is a teenager we're talking about here - don't expect mature behavior. On a side note, I hope she doesn't drink at this New year's Eve Party...", "YTA. No it probably wouldn't hurt her to drop your daughter off even if it is out of her way as long as you are covering the gas but she should not be expected to pick her up and mess up her plans. Her dad got her a car, he didn't get her a taxi. How would you handle this if she hadn't gotten a car.", "NTA\nI understand that her dad bought her the car. But you\u2019re paying for gas and she is old enough at 17 to understand the idea of family helping each other. It would be one thing if you asked her to change her plans entirely or even if you could drive her vehicle. All you asked was for her to give her 11 year old sister a ride. I think that\u2019s a very reasonable ask. My sister was given too many responsibilities for me when I was little (12 year age difference) but a ride that takes her a few extra minutes? Come on. She needs to be a good sister and family member.\n\nWho pays the insurance? Helps with maintenance? Makes sure the car gets inspected? Etc.", "Your resentment about your living situation is starting to show through. Funny how you didn't make a fuss when it was smaller less expensive items, but as soon as you saw an opportunity that would less your burden, you went straight to Entitlement. \n\nYou pay her gas because of her mom and she's underage. You aren't doing her any favors by providing basic necessities that her mother would have to pay regardless of who her partner is.\n\nThe car was a gift from her dad. Just like every other gift she has received from him, you and your daughter aren't entitled to anything from her dad. Even a car. \n\nYou shouldn't have kept pressing after she said no. That's why YTA", "YTA - you asked, you got your answer. You have no say over what she does with *HER* car.", "YTA. It\u2019s ok to ask but no means no. You didn\u2019t pay for the car. She TA for being so rude about it. However, if she\u2019s unwilling to help out now and then she should get a job and pay for her own gas.", "I'm so shocked everyone thinks you're the arsehole I'm just mind blown let her dad pay for her gas", "Easily YTA!  Your step-daughter is not responsible for your daughter, even though they are step-sisters.   Do you pay insurance on her car?   She was right to decline.  You should not make her feel guilty.  Also, why did you have to bring up her dad's cheating on your wife?  It has nothing to do with this.", "\u201cSophie, you can tell your stepsister no without being rude about it.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s about as far as you get to go on this issue.  YTA", "While I agree with other commenters that YTA for expecting or feeling that Sophie should do this...\n\n\nI remember when I first started driving - back when dinosaurs still roamed the earth. Lol. ;-). At the time, in my state, you were allowed to get your learner's permit up to a year before you were of legal age to sit for your behind-the-wheel test to get your full-fledged driver's license.  I did that and became the family chauffeur.  I drove everywhere, in Mom's station wagon (yes, I am that old), with Mom in the seat next to me.  I must have had 400 hours of driving experience by the time I sat for my driver's test!  Once I got my license (no \"probationary driver stickers\" BS back then), I was errand runner (\"go to the store and get a gallon of milk\" -my response \"sure thing, Mom!\" Grabbed the keys and was gooonnnneee) and drove my younger sibs to every party or friends house not within walking distance. And happy to do so.\n\nIt would have given Sophie, as new car owner, more time behind the wheel to improve her skills, but you cannot make her.\n\nCan you, however (next time), appeal to her sense of kindred teenager tired of having to get a ride anywhere from a parent..... that your 11 yo daughter still feels?  Maybe, your SD may sympathize and be more willing to take her step-sister when she isn't already going to a party of her own.  While SD may also look upon your daughter as a step-, your daughter was 7 or 8 yo when she met SD and may look upon her as more sister than step-sister.  Maybe a quiet heart-to-heart to just present this perspective might get SD willing to take the 11 yo places.  Maybe it won't.  But a calm, non-judging, non-take her or you are grounded, convo - adult or near-adult.  \n\nMy bonus kids (now well into their 30s) responded well to that kind of discussion.  And, maybe, stop calling her \"step-daughter\".  Try \"bonus-daughter.\"  A \"bonus\" is something you want and treasure.  A \"step\" is something you tolerate.  Just a thought", "NTA. You didn't force her, you told her she should, and you are right. It's not unreasonable to do a small favor for another family member. I'd stop paying for her gas, 17 is old enough to earn her own fun stuff.", "YTA.\nHer gift shouldn\u2019t be hard against her. \nGiving rides to children is just being a parent which it shouldn\u2019t be", "YTA.  The fact that the dad cheated on the mom should have NOTHING to do with the daughter agreeing to drive your child. Yes, she could have but she has no obligation to become a driver for the family. why don't you drive your wife to work so you have a car during the day?", "YTA\nDont make your daughter your step-daughters problem", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is now 17. I have a 11 year old daughter with my late wife. My wife and I have been together for 3 years. My wife is very kind to my daughter and they are quite close. My daughter has very little memory of her mom and has told me how nice it is to feel like she has a mom now. My wife is also happy to play that role in my daughter\u2019s life. I\u2019m not as close to Sophie, because she\u2019s older and she spends  two weeks a month at her dad\u2019s place. But she\u2019s polite to me and I think she\u2019s a wonderful girl. \n\nSophie\u2019s dad is pretty well off, my wife and I are less so. He was the main earner before my wife left him. My wife and I both work full time, but we have to be careful with our finances right now. We got my daughter a few books and Sophie a dress for Christmas. Both of them liked their presents. Sophie\u2019s dad got Sophie a brand new car. We have only one car in the family right now, I drop my wife off on the way to work in the mornings, so it works out. But it does mean that I couldn\u2019t take my daughter or Sophie anywhere during the holidays, as my wife still has to work. I have the week off because I\u2019m a teacher. (She did have a few days off though.) \n\nNow that Sophie has the car, she is planning to go to her friends\u2019 New Years party. My daughter asked if Sophie could drop her at her friends\u2019 house too, and Sophie said it\u2019s too far out of the way (extra half an hour approx) and it\u2019s her car, so my daughter can wait until she\u2019s old enough to drive. I thought this was uncalled for, so I said Sophie was being rude and she should drop my daughter. She said it\u2019s not her fault I can\u2019t afford another car for us. \n\nMy wife said I should just let it go, because my daughter has a dad all the time and Sophie only has one half the time, and a car is fair compensation (not the right word, but I can\u2019t think of a better one) for that. My daughter and Sophie are both upset now - AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Had it been 5 -10 mins, I could see your point a little bit better.", "YTA, you don\u2019t get to dictate what someone else does with something you didn\u2019t pay for.

Furthermore, if you\u2019re going to give her gas money, give it to her with no expectations of nothing in return. OR expectations that she\u2019ll help every once in awhile, but respect her no. Based on the SD\u2019s response when your daughter asked she doesn\u2019t have a \u201csister\u201d relationship with her.\n\nAlso, you say that SD has nice things and you don\u2019t ask her to share with your daughter. SHE DOESN'T HAVE TOO. If you want YOUR daughter to have certain things YOU need to pay for them, not ask your SD to supplement them.", "NTA.\n\nSophie is only 17, so maybe not the most mature.  But the slamdunk refusal to a supposedly polite and somewhat minor ask is pretty selfish IMO.  Does it point to underlying friction in the family dynamic? Hopefully she'll grow up and be nicer to those around her in the future because there is such a thing as etiquette and small favors in college/workforce.\n\nMaybe she doesn't really see the non-bio step-sister as her real sister and feels no obligation even though you all live under the same roof.

'Uncalled for' would be if she told your 11 y/o to F off.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that these girls will and do have different lives. The 11 y/o doesn't have a wealthy father, so things will always seem unfair to her. It's unfortunate but it doesn't mean that the older girl should be punished for having a leg up.

Or option B- if she doesn't want to/can't find the money to pay for her own gas when she's with you, then so long as you're funding the gas, she'll need to be willing take her step-sis places as needed. Obviously don't take advantage or anything, she shouldn't suddenly have to drive her step-sis everywhere and anywhere on a moments notice or be added to any kind of pick up/drop off schedules, but in situations like this we're you know the family car will be unavailable, it's not unreasonable to expect that she will pick up the slack and give your daughter a ride every now and then.\n\nIf she wants to take the hard stance of \"I don't have to do anything for you\" then she should accept the consequences of taking that stance and no longer have her gas paid for.", "YTA.

Part of the reason you need to, for example, ask an older sibling if they'd like to babysit instead of requiring it, is because being in charge of young children is actually a pretty big responsibility that should be taken seriously, so you don't want a babysitter who is detached and resentful about the whole thing or who isn't confident in their childcare skills.\n\nSo yeah, letting Sophie say no at all also gives her space to say no because she isn't comfortable driving young passengers yet.\n\nBut, shrug, if Sophie's parents trust her driving in general then I have to defer to them.

Almost all states have some form of a graduated licensing provision. The actual restrictions and the length of time a new driver must adhere to them vary widely by state. Restrictions frequently include:\r  \nA curfew, after which night driving is not permitted (unless 18 years of age, or if the individual has completed an online course) without an adult present (typically 11 pm, like Pennsylvania, Michigan, or 12 am,\\[9\\] like Wisconsin). Some states (e.g. North Carolina) have curfews as early as 9 pm. Some states such as New York provide exceptions for special situations, such as driving home from work or school functions, picking up family members, or for medical appointments, while others such as Massachusetts do not.\r  \nRestrictions on the number of passengers under a specific age present in the vehicle.

But at 17, she is still learning how to drive, and shouldn't be giving rides to 11 year olds.", "Ours has daytime limits so Sophie wouldn\u2019t be allowed to drive herself to the party, let alone her sister. OP may not be in one of those states or even in the USA.", "I ours there is an exception for siblings to prevent this scenario exactly (progressive state).", "In my state, you\u2019re not allowed to have passengers under 20, UNLESS they are immediate family members so this point isn\u2019t the best. I still agree that she shouldn\u2019t have to, just saying.", "I said the exact same thing. Many places now are graduated licensing. She likely can't even legally take the child.\n\nNevermind the OP and how his jealousy (he's never made Sophie share even though she always has better things, but this is the last straw) is completely blinding him to the fact that its a 17yr old new driver, in a brand new car shes had for 2 days now, on fecking NYE of all nights, literally the most dangerous driving night of the year. Her stress will already be high, adding the parental responsibility of driving her child sibling is insane.\n\nAdding an 11yr old to that mix is just stupid and dangerous. I'm going to bet she will refuse to sit in the back seat where she belongs. So she will be up front, fucking around with the radio and chattering, or worse, getting into an argument with the driver.\n\nI am just shaking my head at all these people. Calling a 17yr old an asshole because she doesn't want to spend her night playing chauffeur to her sibling, and God forbid, maybe even wants to just enjoy her car by herself. Knowing that she is going to get hounded by the jackass OP to drive, or he'll ask to borrow her car, start doing errands etc.", "Where was that? Usually, there is a requirement of driver's ed to get your license early. Also, your insurance premium is usually much higher if you don't take driver's ed.", "Maybe they\u2019re not in the US. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Maybe she works in a hospital", "What difference does it make if mom or step-dad hands her the gas money.  As this reddit is so fond of pointing out... it's their money.", "Do we know she got the car on Christmas day? Cars are hard to hide, and lots of people give gifts early.", "Thank you! One of the very few replies I didn't have to copy paste the same mesg to about the insanity of this and how dangerous it is. \n\nOP has some serious jealousy issues going on here. \n\"I've never made her share her stuff when she always has much nicer things than my princess, but this is bullshit, how dare she get a car, I'm done, she's sharing, or else\"\n\nHe's tuning his story to make himself sound better in edits, and all the alpha bros are falling for it.", "Nah, the point stands. Your state isn't the law everywhere and neither is mine. That's why I said depending. And I've actually had a few responses say where they live is the same or more strict! I appreciate learning there are exceptions for minors in some places tho", "That response in that tone is exactly why I would be taking the hard line.", "Good time for step dad to stop being entitled.", "Yeah! I remember all my friends at school having to drive their younger siblings back home or whatever, so it\u2019s just pretty normal where I am.", "What? He asked for a favor when he pays her gas? That\u2019s not entitled at all. God forbid you help out family."]}
