To this job, literally 30 miles of small town driving. So i tell her I'll take her for two weeks until she can buy a car, get someone to take her, or find a different job. \nWell obviously that didn't go over well and now we're arguing, she said I'm a narcissistic energy vampire, who only helps people to fill my God complex, and that I'm dirty, live in squalor, my fiance is awful, my kids are awful, etc.\n     \nI told her she's genuinely awful to be around and that mental illness is not a reason to attack people you love, and that I wouldn't be willing to live with her at that point.\nI offered her $1,000 and two weeks of rides to work, and she said that's not enough and I've shafted her; and that next time I want to help someone, just don't. So I rescinded my offer and told her to figure it out herself, though I'll probably still do it, even though I don't want to.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674826760, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ml1gv/aita_for_leaving_my_sister_to_live_in_a_hotel/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is causing issues to YOUR MARRIAGE. And yet you keep just telling her to stop? And now you offered TWO WEEKS to drive her around. What about your kids? Your partner? You have other responsibilities and you keep focusing on your sister.\n\nStop being a doormat. Stand up for your family and tell her to figure it out for herself. She can also find another house and never return to yours.", "Stop helping her. She\u2019s going to keep doing this over and over again and get away with other because you\u2019re enabling her. How old is her grown ass anyway?", "Yeah that's what he said. I definitely can't let my lax boundaries affect them", "Four hours... it's an hour just there", "Well, it\u2019s time to be an adult and act like an adult.  Being an adult and saying no, it\u2019s mean.  It\u2019s called prioritizing yourself first.\n\nYou are setting yourself and your husband and your kids on fire to keep her warm.  So you are all getting burnt because you set yourselves on fire for her, and she is disrespecting you.\n\nIt\u2019s time for you to stand up for yourself and your family.  You and your husband are married, you made vows to each other.  If you used the standard vows, one of those is forsaking all others.  That view isn\u2019t about cheating, it\u2019s about putting your spouses needs before everyone else\u2019s like a sister.  You each vowed to put the needs of each other first before all others.\n\nWhen someone asks for help or demands help, sometimes what they are asking for isn\u2019t what they actually need.  Your sister is an adult, and if she has mental issues, then she needs to figure out how to get help for her issues.  However, since she is an adult, she doesn\u2019t have to if she doesn\u2019t want to.  If she is homeless, that is her issue to resolve.  Just because she is homeless doesnt mean that you need to take her in.  Instead, you can say, here are the locations for homeless shelters.  Here is a list of resources and services that you can use to get yourself back on your own two feet.  As long as you do for her, she doesn\u2019t have to do for herself.\n\nYou are holding her back from dealing with her issues by taking her in.\n\nSo, politely but firmly, you need to say no.  If she lives with you, you need to tell her she has to get her own place by the end of next week.  You will give her x money to get started.  You will not drive her to work.  She needs to get herself to work.  This is not being mean, this is being an adult.  You are prioritizing your children and husband over her.  Because she is an adult and responsible for her own well being.\n\nYou need to accept the fact that she is going to be angry at you.  That\u2019s because you are going to stop allowing her to abuse you.  She is abusing you because you are too afraid of making her mad or whatever, so you have been willing to ruin your well being and the well being of your children for her.  You need to put your children first.  That is your responsibility.  They are minors and have no say or no choice.  They can\u2019t leave a toxic situation because they are minors.  It is your responsibility as an adult to provide your kids with a safe and peaceful home and life.  When your sister gets angry with you, the simple response is, my kids and husband come first.\n\nI would strongly suggest that you need a 3 month break from your sister.  No calls, no visits, no emails, no texts, no bailing her out.  You need that time to regroup and figure out some strategies for yourself.  Use the excuse of lax boundaries is a lame excuse.  You are an adult and have adult responsibilities, you don\u2019t have the luxury of having lax boundaries that HARM your children.  Your children are being harmed by the toxic atmosphere.  They are learning that this is normal.  They are learning that you should let family members abuse you because you don\u2019t have the strong spine to say no.\n\nHope this helps.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
