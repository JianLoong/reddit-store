They were upfront with me and SIL about wanting a lot of kids from our early days of dating.\n\nSIL and BIL are starting to try for their first kid, and SIL has been leaning on me for emotional support, which I am very glad to provide.\n\nLast Sunday, she asked me to be brutally honest about what it's like to have 6 kids. I told her that my experience will not be very helpful to her, seeing as how our situations are very different, and she asked me to explain.\n\nSo I told her that I am a SAHM wife with a passive income in the high 6 figures, my husband makes over 300k a year, so we are lucky enough to not have to think about the financials when it comes to a large family.\n\nSame goes with child care, I have 2 nannies, that is the only way I found to be able to give all my kids the attention they need, seeing as my youngest has health issues. And that even without those health issues, 6 kids are a lot of work without someone there.\n\nAnd finally, my husband and I were looking into adoption and surrogacy because pregnancy is hard on the body, so 3 was my limit of pregnancies, and that we were lucky that we were able to foster to adopt our 3 adoptive kids. But if we didn't, adopting 3 extra kids, or hiring surrogates was going to be very expensive.\n\nWell, apparently she talked with BIL, and told him what I said, as well as how they should maybe space having kids more, so they could give them a higher living standards, and now he is accusing me of manipulating her, and being a jealous bitch who wants to be the only one with the big family.\n\nWas I an AH by telling her everything I did?", "created_utc": 1694605494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16hkugt/aita_for_telling_my_sil_exactly_what_having_a_big/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your BIL very well know that what you said was true, and it must hurt to know that his big family plan will probably not work because of their life choice and lack of money. They are just shooting the messenger.", "NTA. Normally telling people about your wealth isn't the best idea, but in this case, having such a high income IS how you manage to have six kids, and you were right to be upfront about it.", "NTA, you served her straight facts, if the husband doesn't like it, oh well, that's just how the world goes.", "NTA.\n\nYou answered her question honestly, and sometimes that means sharing info they either may not have expected or was hoping not to be the case. But SIL asked for your opinion and about your experiences for a reason.", "NTA she asked, you answered that's it \n\n\nIf He wants a fairytale He needs to visit a book Store", "NTA. She asked for brutal honesty, and you gave just that. Doesn't sound like there was any malice or jealousy attached to it.  Why would you be jealous?  Lol.", "NTA. She asked, you answered. He\u2019s upset with the answer and he has every right to be but that doesn\u2019t make you an AH. She should ask other parents of big families or even small families - everyone has what does and does not work for them. Your answer doesn\u2019t need to dictate her life; if she uses it to guide their decisions then it\u2019s her choice not yours.", "NTA. BIL does not want to know the details, bit he needs them. Good your SIL seens to listen and make her mind up these things.", "NTA - WOW the idea that being honest about your experience is manipulative is just\u2026 well wow. I see no reason in the world why spacing out a large amount of children would be seen as unreasonable. So someone who grew up extremely poor, giving serious thought to your children\u2019s quality of life is not only responsible but it\u2019s the right damn thing to do. My hubs family is large, 4 boys. They were raised more upper mid class but at one point FIL got laid off, and he still express regret for those 2yrs finances were tight. How he regrets his temper at the time, every time he has to say no to the boys. It haunts him even though for the most part the boys remember a good childhood. Spacing children out is responsible. You were being honest, you did nothing wrong. The only reason I can think for him to be upset is if he\u2019s one of those \u2018I want 4 kinds in 4yrs\u2019 kind of guys. In which case he just sucks cuz that\u2019s hell on a woman\u2019s body and no one has a right to demand something like that.", "Nope...\n\nIm guessing BIL/SIL isnt financially as stable as you and not able to afford nannies???\n\nBIL needs to grow the F up.. im guessing hes not the one staying home and raising the kids???\n\nDoes.he not realise the hard work it takes to raise kids???\n\nNTA", "nta. tell your bil to knock that shit down ... having children isnt a fuckin collection.", "NTA, she asked for your honest opinion based on your experience and you gave it to her. She\u2019s mad that you didn\u2019t sugar coat and tell her what she wanted to hear.", "NTA, you were realistic. Six kids is a lot and the fact that you can afford to hire help and don't have to worry financially about feeding, clothing, providing medical care, etc. for that many people is all very significant in choosing to have a big family. It sounds like she either twisted what you said when she went back to relay your conversation to her husband, or he took it wrong and somehow deduced you were being manipulative. They should be practical and prepared and it sounds like you were just trying to help and he got his back up. That's his problem ,not yours.", "The bil expected you and yours to support him and his.\n\nSince they always wanted large families...\n\nNta", "NTA - people who have kids they can\u2019t afford are AHs", "NTA. Why do people ask questions and then get upset about the answer? She asked you to be 'brutally' honest, which is exactly what you did and BIL is pissed, why? Stating facts and figures is not manipulation.

No you gave her the shed truth of parenting. Your advantages and things to think about it. \n\nIt gives her perspective. She\u2019s going to need that. Maybe three kids is better then 6 for her. She matters since she may be the default parent", "How old is SIL ? If I understood correctly, she\u2019s still not against a large family, but against having the kids in quick succession to avoid financial strain??? If she\u2019s young band hopefully healthy, I think it can be done", "NTA you were honest with her and very correct about what it's like to have kids right now, especially having multiple kids.", "NTA\n\nSo your husband would prefer his sister to pop out as many kids as possible with little to no thought as to the financial and bodily impact that would have on her? Or have I missed something here?", "NTA.  Your husband needs to have a talk with his brother he wants a continuing relationship with you and your family.

Bad behavior needs to have repercussions!", "Bil didn\u2019t think about the logistics and is upset someone spoke truthfully.\nMotherhood is often romanticized, idealized. The reality is that there are challenges and often the brunt of the work, financial loss and/or career delay falls on the female (hello there patriarchy!)\nNTA for answering truthfully to your SIL as she requested that.", "It\u2019s great that your bil thinks his opinion of what a women goes is more important than an actual women\u2019s perspective. \n\nNTA.", "NTA you were a good friend. BIL needs to listen.", "NTA. You didn't do anything other than explain the experience you have had raising your 6 children.", " If I may ask, what do you do that pays you so well?", "NTA you were extremely open about your experience and how hers might be different", "NTA! You warned her and perfectly explained how the two of you are different in that situation! She is going to be an amazing mom for her decision is so responsible she is thinking about the future and not just popping out babies cause they want a big family", "NTA. She asked for your honest opinion and you told her the truth. It is important to be aware of what life with children is like before making such decisions, so it was good of her to seek advice from you. You did nothing wrong.", "Nta", "He does, he worked extremely hard, and he makes around 120k I think, but with how everything is currently, and them still having student loans, and her planning to quit her job, that 120k will not be enough to support the number of kids they want, not while maintaining the same standard of living they are used to right now.", "Right, BIL WANTED to manipulate his wife but OP ruined it by telling her the truth! s0 m@NipUlaTiVe!", "That's what I think too, he is an extremely nice person, and I think he is lashing at me because he was forced to face reality.", "They already knew, it's not like we could hide it. My husband is a CRNA, and I met my husband through my BIL, since BIL used to work for my family.", "Actually, he didn't. He has a really good job, 6 figures, but not high enough that he could support 6 kids, a SAHM and maintain the same lifestyle.", "So basically, you were being more practical about their situation than he was.", "I make more than that, and my wife works, and we only have 2 kids. If we had 3 then things like expensive kids\u2019 activities/sports, vacations, having a bedroom for everyone + extra space, etc would all get difficult. If we had 6 kids, we would be functionally poor. No restaurants, no extracurricular activities, no vacations, kids doubled up in bedrooms, etc. Their plan to have that many kids on $120K household income is irresponsible", "It sounds like he\u2019s the one being manipulative and maybe jealous. She may be thinking more sensibly going forward", "But that really isn't a problem if they also plan on adopting, is it?  They can do that AFTER they pay down the student loan debt and get a handle on a bigger house.  BIL does not want to see the planning and hard work it would require, it seems.  I have 3 kids and make a little more than BIL in a high COL area.  If I weren't debt & mortgage free, I wouldn't have had #3.  Because it isn't fair to the kids.", "You are NTA and were truly offering good insight into what it is like. Maybe your husband can have a good conversation with his brother. Since they share the same background, he may put more stock into what his brother has to say. I'm sure SIL appreciates what you shared with her.", "I must say.   You come across in this post as a truly kind person.   Those kids are lucky to have you.  And so is SIL and BIL.   You\u2019ve handle his anger with grace.   \n\nNTA", "Right. And that's where the problem lies. He will want to keep the same lifestyle so he's the same as his brother. \n\nUnless he can find a way, that doesn't mean hitting up the family for money, he's going to have resentment set in that he wasn't able to have the large family like his brother did and keep the same lifestyle...\n\nWhich then will start affecting his work life and his home life.  \n\nOpie you are just being practical that's not what he's being...", "Those were things I brought up, but due to the character limit, I didn't go into detail.\n\nOur kids are still young, but their activities are already expensive.

We have 2 extra cars because schedules overlap, and we need the nannies to drive them sometimes. \n\nMy youngest has to go to the hospital practically every other week, my 2 other adopted kids have therapy every week, and even with how much we make, we have to budget if we don't want to start taking on debt, as well as save for our retirement and their college.", "You family sounds awesome, and she literally asked you for brutal, straight talk and so how can they complain when you told them exact truth? \n\nNTA"]}
