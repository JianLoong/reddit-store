A \"lefty\" who both wants to control what women do with their bodies and also supports Russia. Oh, and who also fat shames people, based on your few comments.\n\nDo you have any idea how transparent you are? Any whatsoever?\n\n> I said surrogacy is basically predatory and it's always the same story lol OP brags about her high six figure passive income meanwhile she's a stay at home mom that still needs two nannies\n\nSo now you're conflating surrogacy and nannies?\n\nAlso, how many kids have you adopted?\n\n> wait til you find out many women are coerced into sex work.\n\nCompletely off-topic, but okay. So I'm sure that you'll support the legalization of sex work so that it will be safer for women?\n\n(Waits for another \"leftist\" opinion on this topic...)\n\n> but if I'm against that im against women choosing right? \n\nNo, literally no one wants that.\n\nLet's just see if you actually want to solve it, though. \n\nJust like the adoption question--no interest in a solution or helping out, just whataboutism.\n\nSome might think that would be grounds for reevaluating your worldview, but others are much smarter than that."]}
