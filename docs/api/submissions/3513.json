If u didn't want to buy it u shouldn't have.  \n\nSecond, while ur husband may be fine with staying at ur parents house he is prob low-key uncomfortable there too, many people are like that at inlaws houses, but he prob does it bc he loves you and his kids. Unless ur inlaws are horrible adults can awkwardly share space for a little bit.  \n\nThird, the adult bonding time that happens after kids go to bed is, imo, important in families. He prob wants to hang out with his brother and bond, and he prob wants u to bond with him as well, and to not have to worry how u and the kids are doing.   Alot, of the 12 hours that u spend with them (which honestly u kinda sound like u think u are sacrificing ur first born to \"let\" him do that) is gonna be about the kids not the adults. And I wonder if ur husband ever thinks wow we spend 12 hours with her family isn't that enough.\n\nFourth, the way u described the accommodations at ur inlaws rubs me the wrong way.  This cld be my bias, but saying the bed wasn't even a queen or king just sounds spoiled on ur part.  Ur not checking into the Ritz ur staying with family.  Will u and the kids maybe be uncomfortable yea but when u travel with kids they get cranky and tired (and I know it sucks I've done it) but a bad sleep schedule isn't gonna kill them for a few days.  Also, I kinda get the feeling that when they are older the excuse will be that ur kids can't be expected to share a room or something.  \n\nIf every other trip is spent sleeping at ur parents maybe  compromise and try it at his this time.\n\n\nEdit: I'm changing my vote to NTA bc I just saw the child abuse comment. That should be in the post and honestly staying at the house shld be off the table.", "ETA: this comment was written prior to OP adding the info regarding a history of sexual abuse in the home, which makes them very very much NTA for protecting their kids. \n\nI\u2019m going with soft YTA. Sleeping in other locations is never easy, especially with kids. But if there is another bedroom the kids can stay in, there is probably room in it for a pack and play and a bassinet (or at least one of those). Use a video monitor or FaceTime to monitor them when you are downstairs socializing and in another room. It doesn\u2019t sound like the house is cavernous and you wouldn\u2019t hear a crying baby in the night. As for pumping- I know it isn\u2019t fun in someone else\u2019s house, but there are ways to make it easier (pumping bra, cooler with ice in the room for the milk/ pump parts so you dont need to store them in the fridge, pump in your car in the driveway if you feel like it isn\u2019t private, etc). I think someone needs to tell you that you are being selfish. You want to stay with your parents, which you admit you ALWAYS do. BIL being there is a rare occasion, and you are the one who needs to compromise and change your routine this once.", "Yta it's not unusual to have different sleeping accomodations when you visit family. It's very selfish to always make you husband stay at your parents house and not allow him the comfort of being at home that you always enjoy.", "Yes I offered that as well, but we both have a little bit of separation anxiety and he doesn\u2019t want to be apart from me or the kids for even a night.", "I\u2019ve offered this! He has said no because he doesn\u2019t want to be apart from us for a whole night.

So I\u2019d have to get there and then go pump and waste a half hour in a room by myself.", "I agree. an even bigger olive branch would be to have their husband stay a night at his parents house on his own to catch up with his brother. assuming parenting duties are otherwise split fairly, it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to give him a little extra time with his brother since there is help with the kids from the grandparents as well.", "If we are spending 12 hours a day at my in-laws, aren\u2019t they already bonding with that side of the family?? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve said we can\u2019t go over there at all, just that sleeping there doesn\u2019t seem to work for us. My Toddler will climb over the pillows if he wants out of bed.

You say 12 hours but what typically will end up happening is oh baby woke up, let me feed them, oh they soiled their nappy, let me change it and by the time you leave it would be 11-12, and then you would still be rigid about their sleeping time so everyone had to rush to finish dinner and conversation so you can leg it.\n\nIf you were staying overnight, you can take things easily, feed the kids put them to bed, and then chill with the in-laws.

I guess since that\u2019s not something that can be fixed overnight, would there be a way to put the bassinet and toddler bed in the living room and have your husband and BIL hang out in one of the spare rooms after the kids go to bed?
