Someday, when the kids are a little older, they can share a bed at his parents, but not right now.", "One other option - let husband spend a night or 2 at his parent's house so that he and his brother can spend time together.

First stop saying things like we already bought a plane ticket for ur brother do we have to do this too, that's holding the plane ticket over ur husband's head. If u didn't want to buy it u shouldn't have.  \n\nSecond, while ur husband may be fine with staying at ur parents house he is prob low-key uncomfortable there too, many people are like that at inlaws houses, but he prob does it bc he loves you and his kids. Unless ur inlaws are horrible adults can awkwardly share space for a little bit.  \n\nThird, the adult bonding time that happens after kids go to bed is, imo, important in families. He prob wants to hang out with his brother and bond, and he prob wants u to bond with him as well, and to not have to worry how u and the kids are doing.   Alot, of the 12 hours that u spend with them (which honestly u kinda sound like u think u are sacrificing ur first born to \"let\" him do that) is gonna be about the kids not the adults. And I wonder if ur husband ever thinks wow we spend 12 hours with her family isn't that enough.\n\nFourth, the way u described the accommodations at ur inlaws rubs me the wrong way.  This cld be my bias, but saying the bed wasn't even a queen or king just sounds spoiled on ur part.  Ur not checking into the Ritz ur staying with family.  Will u and the kids maybe be uncomfortable yea but when u travel with kids they get cranky and tired (and I know it sucks I've done it) but a bad sleep schedule isn't gonna kill them for a few days.  Also, I kinda get the feeling that when they are older the excuse will be that ur kids can't be expected to share a room or something.  \n\nIf every other trip is spent sleeping at ur parents maybe  compromise and try it at his this time.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA. Sleeping in other locations is never easy, especially with kids. But if there is another bedroom the kids can stay in, there is probably room in it for a pack and play and a bassinet (or at least one of those). Use a video monitor or FaceTime to monitor them when you are downstairs socializing and in another room. It doesn\u2019t sound like the house is cavernous and you wouldn\u2019t hear a crying baby in the night. As for pumping- I know it isn\u2019t fun in someone else\u2019s house, but there are ways to make it easier (pumping bra, cooler with ice in the room for the milk/ pump parts so you dont need to store them in the fridge, pump in your car in the driveway if you feel like it isn\u2019t private, etc). I think someone needs to tell you that you are being selfish. You want to stay with your parents, which you admit you ALWAYS do. BIL being there is a rare occasion, and you are the one who needs to compromise and change your routine this once.", "Yta it's not unusual to have different sleeping accomodations when you visit family. It's very selfish to always make you husband stay at your parents house and not allow him the comfort of being at home that you always enjoy.", "Yes I offered that as well, but we both have a little bit of separation anxiety and he doesn\u2019t want to be apart from me or the kids for even a night.", "I\u2019ve offered this!

So I\u2019d have to get there and then go pump and waste a half hour in a room by myself.", "I agree. an even bigger olive branch would be to have their husband stay a night at his parents house on his own to catch up with his brother. assuming parenting duties are otherwise split fairly, it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal to give him a little extra time with his brother since there is help with the kids from the grandparents as well.", "If we are spending 12 hours a day at my in-laws, aren\u2019t they already bonding with that side of the family?? It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve said we can\u2019t go over there at all, just that sleeping there doesn\u2019t seem to work for us. My Toddler will climb over the pillows if he wants out of bed.

You say 12 hours but what typically will end up happening is oh baby woke up, let me feed them, oh they soiled their nappy, let me change it and by the time you leave it would be 11-12, and then you would still be rigid about their sleeping time so everyone had to rush to finish dinner and conversation so you can leg it.\n\nIf you were staying overnight, you can take things easily, feed the kids put them to bed, and then chill with the in-laws.

Y T A for not cutting all contact with this side of the family.", "So your husband is being selfish and unreasonable, already disregarding sleep routines but on top of that doesn\u2019t care about potentially putting them in danger? He sounds wonderful\u2026", "How about getting little toddler beds for your 2 kids so they want have to sleep on a big bed?", "Let him go to his parents alone and you go to your's NTA", "NTA. You are being reasonable and flexible. Your husband is not.", "NTA\u2026seems like you offered many compromises and your husband just wants it his way.  Stick to your guns and let him stay at his parents.  What are you going to do while they bond anyway?  And it is only thirty minutes away, so it would not be like you won\u2019t see each other daily.  All he is going to do is sleep at his parents.", "NTA\n\nA good night's sleep is important. All your reasons are valid. Why don't you offer your husband a night or two to stay with his brother without you.", "NTA\n\nIf there\u2019s not enough room for your family at his parents\u2019 house, how is there going to be enough room for your family AND his brother?", "The easiest way, is to OP sleep alone with the kids on OP's parent's house, and tell to her husband stop with the Childish behaviour - NTA \n(Look, screw if \u200b\u200byour husband will be uncomfortable \"sleeping away from the kids\", If it's better for their safety)", "Esh. Way to compromise", "NTA", "Jumping onto the current top comment to include OP\u2019s comment further down-\n\n\u201cNo. I will not allow my kids to stay somewhere without me. (His family especially has a lot of instances of sexual abuse that have occurred in either his parents house or his grandparents) not taking any risks with my kids.\u201d\n\nStaying there shouldn\u2019t even be a conversation and OP\u2019s husbands inability to compromise is is troubling based on this information.\n\nNTA Op, protect your kids!", "This right here is the perfect answer.  Husband is refusing to compromise.  He wants to stay more nights at his parents where (1) children can't stay in their own room because of potential sexual abuse (based on OPs comment) so that is 4 people in a double bed and (2) children aren't sleep trained so will lose out on sleep.\n\nOP, ask your husband why *HE* isn't willing to compromise.", "OP has really buried the lede on this one, sexual abuse has taken place in the parents\u2019 home, and the parents *still* have an open door policy which includes the abuser. Her husband is trying to bully her into the vulnerable position of having herself and her children sleep in a house where known abusers are welcome to come in and out as they please. He\u2019s refusing every possible compromise she\u2019s suggested and is being stubborn and demanding the most unsafe option because that\u2019s what he wants. I know Reddit leaps to \u2018divorce him\u2019 a bit quick but given the past abuse and his AH behaviour here OP should be lining up her ducks and seeing a sharky lawyer who can get it written in to the custody agreement that her children can never sleep in that house or be in the care of her in-laws. It is too late to go back once a child\u2019s been attacked, and the husband seems to be angling for it to happen.", "OP buried the lede. There has been sexual abuse in the parents\u2019 home and their open door policy still includes the abuser. OP is trying to protect her kids and it\u2019s very reasonable to not want to sleep under the same roof as people who keep company with rapists.", "Would you happily let your small children sleep over in a home where sexual abuse has taken place, and the home owners still welcome the abuser?

Jfc.", "And she's not the boss of him nor the sole boss of the kids. Although they are struggling to do so, they seem to be trying to come to a mutual agreement. Why would you suggest she give an ultimatum? How would that be any better than him giving an ultimatum?", "Nta. Taking kids out of their normal routine is hard enough, its much better for the kids to be on a stable vacation routine too. Staying for Xmas eve is more than reasonable.

As long as unsafe people have access to a location the kids dont get to be raised in that location. Keep ur babies safe."]}
