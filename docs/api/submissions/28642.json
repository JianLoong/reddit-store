We each have four people on our wedding party sides, one of his groomsmen being his brother Drew (42M) who lives in another state from everyone- think getting married in New Hampshire but aaron and I live in Tennessee and Drew lives in South Carolina (not actual states but close enough for context). \n\nWe got engaged over a year ago and started planning almost immediately, securing a date within the first 48 hours of engagement. Everyone has known about this wedding, everyone has been anticipating the wedding, we sent out save the dates early due to the location and tourism in Autumn where the venue is. And invitations soon after. \n\nWe, Aaron and I, the other groomsmen, and my in laws have been reminding Drew of the suit for months now. He has known the style color, where to go, all of the information for a minimum of six months - we even offered to pay for it (as I did for my bridesmaids dresses). \nDrew has had plenty of time to get the suit or express that he hasn\u2019t. We\u2019ve asked numerous times if he had the suit and he said it was taken care of. He even asked and showed us the shoes he planned to wear. \n\nAaron got a call late Sunday night from Drew\u2014 bottom line, he still hasn\u2019t gotten a suit. He\u2019s driving from SC to NH and needs to leave by Wednesday (tomorrow) afternoon if he is going to be there for the wedding. \n\nThe suits were custom ordered due to the color and took weeks for the other groomsmen to get them in. I don\u2019t even have his measurements or we would try to get it for him. \n\nMy issue is I am absolutely livid. This is the only thing that I have gotten upset about and I feel genuinely disrespected and like Drew doesn\u2019t care at all about his brother\u2019s wedding. If he doesn\u2019t get the correct suit I don\u2019t want him standing up with us. I just know I will be looking at him in his mismatched suit and feel pissed off and sad that he didn\u2019t care enough to figure this out when we told him to. \n\nHis brother always blames everyone else when things go wrong and never takes accountability. He\u2019s been giving Aaron attitude now as if it\u2019s not a big deal. So please tell me if I\u2019m overreacting. \n\nWIBTA if I asked him to simply attend as a guest if he doesn\u2019t get the suit in time? I feel like a bitch but if he couldn\u2019t prioritize his brothers wedding why should he be standing up there in the first place? I feel disrespected and so does Aaron.\n\nETA: we paid for all wedding party and immediate family lodging so the destination wouldn\u2019t be a financial burden. Also offered to pay for groomsman attire as I did for the bridesmaids dresses/ alterations and hair/makeup. We truly tried to make it as easy for everyone as possible especially if finances would have hindered attendance.\n\nETA II: Aaron/ fianc\u00e9e is also super upset. My apologies for not including it. He feels like his big brother should have at least communicated he needed help and feels really let down. He\u2019s sad and has mentioned he hopes he doesn\u2019t even show up (another concern we had\u2014 not even making it). He\u2019s offended it wasnt a priority and even went back through texts and calls to see how many times he\u2019s reminded and provided him with the suit details.. seven reminders from Aaron alone and several from their parents and other groomsmen. Also drew is not best man he\u2019s a groomsman.", "created_utc": 1696946731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174m3h0/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fianc\u00e9es_brother_as_a/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just be prepared for backlash from in-laws and family because he'll probably try to pain this out as your fault instead of his.", "YWNBTA - He should've taken care of this before now.  Be prepared for him to make your day miserable though.  He sounds like a pouter.", "NTA - at first I thought this was going to be some petty stuff but you\u2019re absolutely correct.

They're getting married *approximately* 1000mi/1600km away from where they currently live.\n\nNTA / YWNBTA. For a lot of weddings, agreeing to be in the wedding party means agreeing to a lot of extra responsibilities. Whether it's helping out, contributing funds or efforts, or planning additional events. The *base minimum* of agreeing to be in a wedding party is agreeing to wear whatever the people getting married decided was going to be their theme or style. That is the *minimum* requirement, and he couldn't even do that.\n\nSo no, him just being his brother doesn't immediately make him entitled to standing with your fianc\u00e9. Not if he's not going to play ball. Maybe you're \"over-reacting,\" but that doesn't make you incorrect. At the end of the day, it's your wedding, your rules.

He was invited to be in the wedding party, he chose to not participate.", "NTA. \n\nIt is remarkably rude to just not get the attire requested to be in a wedding. He could have declined to be in the wedding if he didn't want to get a special suit, he could have reached out when the suit was chosen if there was an issue (too expensive, feels it is a waste of money, needs help ordering), but to wait until 2 weeks before shows a lack of basic respect and that he just doesn't care. \n\nI think your fiance is the one that needs to handle this and you should defer to him on what he wants to do- after discussing of course and ideally agreeing/compromising- as it is his brother and his family, so just make sure you listen to him and let his opinion carry a bit (a little) more weight than yours. \n\nMy suggestion would be for your fiance to let him know that he is welcome to attend as a guest but is no longer in the wedding party. Keep it short and don't engage in a back and forth- hey, I don't know what happened since you told us you had ordered it, but it's not okay to just tell us now, there's nothing we can do to get you a matching suit, and so you aren't going to be in the wedding party. I have to figure out what to do now about our own planning, so will see you there. \n\nThen he needs to tell his parents the conversation and tell them this isn't open for debate, but he wanted to them to know for when brother calls upset with them. \n\nAnd then just don't engage in any drama or back and forth about the issue.

Aaron, his parents and other siblings are all working together to try to find an alternative. I just wish Drew told us sooner bc we would\u2019ve done whatever he needed. \nI\u2019m now just worried about his attitude and how he will act during the wedding (negative and moody). Aaron and I have been on the same page and he has said if he sees Drew or speaks to him it\u2019ll end poorly.", "It\u2019s not complicated, you gave him everything he needed, even offered to buy the suit for him!\n\nBut if he wasn\u2019t going to cooperate then he can no longer participate!", "You\u2019re definitely in the right, but your phrasing of \u2018WIBTA if I asked him\u2019 is setting yourself up for trouble.\n\nHe is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother and his groomsman, and therefore his responsibility. Unless you have it cleared with him that this is the approach you want to take this situation is about to get much worse.\n\nYou said he feels disrespected as well, so it sounds like he is on your side. If not you have a whole new problem.\n\nNTA", "Exactly.\n\nOdd how OP only mentioned the fianc\u00e9 at the start and never really touched on how he feels.", "Honestly fuck Drew. Let him come and watch the ceremony as a guest.\n\nCongrats yourself! Weddings bring out the worst in people !", "I still wouldn't have him stand up there....but I just wanted to know that you and your fiancee need to be prepared for any backlash that may happen from it.\n\nI wouldn't have him stand up there if he couldn't be responsible enough to get the suit before this.", "This was not \"people\". Your future husband did this - HE chose his brother as his best man. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu do realize kicking the best man out of the wedding party will likely mean he won't come to the wedding at all?", "Just the same.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen it is: \"How would YOU react if your partner kicked one of YOUR bridesmaids out of the wedding party?\"", "It's not up to the others though. I've been married and having a person not having a matching suit would F up all the pictures. If any other groomsmen have had a wedding they would know this.", "\"He feels bad since his task was to ensure the groomsmen had everything.\" .. YOur partner certainly dropped the ball there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"t took him a minute to realize I was pissed at Drew \" ..s o he is happy the creepy dragon does not want to bite him but his brother, and is keeping silent?", "Just confirm with him and let him deal with his brother. NTA", "You are 100% NTA for being upset, angry, frustrated AND for not wanting him in the wedding party if he can't get this together at the last minute.\n\nHowever, YOU can not deliver this message to yiur future BIL. It is your fiance' s groomsmen and it is his brother. \n\nYou two need to be on the same page about what is going to happen and your fiance's job to deliver the message to your future BIL. You need to stay away from the delivery part of this with a 10 foot pole.", "You will look lovely, it will be lovely, it will be ok, remember it\u2019s supposed to be fun, you can take pictures without him and all that bollocks, it\u2019s supposed to be about joining families and stuff together. I know it feels big and serious now but it is just a big party, so have fun. People are knob heads, your prospective BIL sounds like one, you can accept it or let it make you cross, I think you\u2019re bigger than that. Have some wine.", "Then how could you possibly be the AH?\n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9's preferences take priority. \n\nGo forth, demote your future brother in law, and prosper.\n\nGood luck with everything!", "Sorry! Aaron is equally if not more upset than I am. He\u2019s mentioned just not having him attend at all since his behavior might be a liability based on how Drew has reacted but I think he\u2019d regret not having his brother there. I forget it\u2019s anonymous and no one knows how we are as a couple lol but we are both on the same page as far as being frustrated and upset and slightly offended. I\u2019m more so coming from a place of being upset on Aaron\u2019s behalf. Just like he would be if I was dealing with something similar. We\u2019re just disappointed Drew didn\u2019t care enough to at a minimum tell us he needed help. Sorry was battling the word limit! But fianc\u00e9e and I are a strong team lol", "LOL. Thanks for this. If this was a one off and not a common theme with Drew I\u2019d think more rationally. But there\u2019s a reason why MIL needed to keep reminding him too\u2026 he just can\u2019t get his shit together. His dad is gonna lose it when he hears", "He\u2019s a groomsman. Sorry for confusion.", "Personally I'd be fine about it, as long as they have a good reason. And not being bothered to sort out your outfit even though you've been reminded about it, been told they'll pay for it if you can't etc, is one.", "Funny enough, besides my one bridesmaid who got married this year\u2014 no one else is married and I doubt they\u2019ve even been to many weddings\u2026 yet everyone else figured it out. Except for Drew who has been to weddings (but was actually so late to the last one he missed the ceremony so maybe he never realized the groomsmen matched?)", "Well he should lose it on Drew's inability to plan lol. Best of luck!", "He is definitely a jerk and out of the wedding, but do you think there was a reason he was avoiding it besides just being lazy? Was he trying to lose weight?", "Sorry for getting that wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill: If you kick him out of the wedding party, he likely won't come at all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu should consider how your fiancee will react to you making his brother skip his wedding, and how THAT will impact your marriage and your future relationships in your family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU will be the one station a suit is more important that relationships. And that is what people are going to see: A bride kicking her BIL out of the wedding because of some color sheme issues. YOU will not live that down easily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is NOT abput being right, this is about how much scorched earth you are willing to cause. And: It was your fiance's job to make sure everybody git the suits right - HE dropped that ball. And he chose his brother as a groomsman, KMOWING he was that way.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you have to live with the consequences: Worng suit, or broken up (extended) family - and that WILL stress your fiance out for years to come, and the impact on your relationship will NOT be good.", "Good question. No weight loss or anything like that. Just wasn\u2019t a priority. He\u2019s blaming everything on this just not himself", "So much this. OP can be as hurt/mad whatever they want. But this boils down to fianc\u00e9 and brother and what fianc\u00e9 is willing to do/wants with regards to his brother.", "Out of curiosity, what *is* he blaming for his own refusal to get the damn suit?", "Exactly what possibly could be a decent reason when OP offered to buy it ?!?!", "NTA \n\nHis brother can be a guest\u2026 if he shows. Not a groomsman. \n\nStop coddling this loser.\n\nBut this has to come from his brother, not you. Your fianc\u00e9 needs to own this decision. Just remind your fianc\u00e9 that everytime he looks at the photos of your day with his brother as a groomsman that he will be reminded of how little his brother cares about this.", "I was just at a wedding where one of the bridesmaids walked with 2 groomsmen, no big deal.  Yours can do the same and Drew can sit as a guest.  He'd look like a dork standing up there and you don't need that.  You could let him usher if he manages to actually bring a suit to wear.  What a putz.", "NTA\n\nWhile I tend to favour family over formality, you have been more than accomodating.", "NTA - But the dude lives elsewhere with a different life. Yes, he's family, but how much do you guys see and speak to him? He's shit at this thing yes, but is he a shit brother generally? Is he just a rubbish adult treating all things with similar carelessness? Does he treat his own life with similar lack of care?\n\nWeddings are a formal affair for most of us, but I can almost guarantee that the photographer could have fun with this. Do the normal wedding photos with the groomsmen and make the guy who's a shit adult hiding in the background. Maybe make him wear something even worse than the standard formal attire, but in the right colours. Something from a charity shop. A 'shame tracksuit' if you will, that you make him wear some 75ft behind everyone else so you can only actually see him if you zoom and enhance CSI-style. Obviously he's going to be changing in and out of this to make sure he doesn't embarrass you entirely\n\nA groomsman is there to support the groom, but you know male relationships are not all about turning out formally and pledging support-  some people genuinely hate that sort of thing, are terrible at any kind of structure or expectation, and may not even be looking after themselves whatever age they are, but would still be ride or die. If he really takes no accountability at all then you have your answer, but in my experience it's all in the detail\\*.\n\n\\*I had people flake on my wedding too, turn up late, not RSVP and turn up anyway... Not all of them were assholes or just caught up in themselves. One realised he'd fucked up on the day-of, never told us because he didn't want to cause us extra stress, leveraged every favour he could call in and still failed to turn up in the end. We never really knew exactly what he was going through and the attempt itself was still one of the best presents I got in the end, knowing what I do now. For that day at least he was at least willing to get out of bed, which was more than he did for himself. I was so glad I never blamed him for it.", "One thing that really helped with wedding planning\u2014my partner and I consistently reminded each other that certain family members were going to be exactly who they always were even on the day of our wedding. \n\nSo, NTA, but let this be a reminder to all the other engaged folks. The Drews are always gonna Drew. Plan accordingly.", "It\u2019s a wedding, not an ambassadors ball\n\nChange what you want", "NTA", "NTA. You were going to pay for the suit and he had 6 months to do it. You are being super reasonable.", "My theory is that bro In law is butt hurt he isn't the best man.\nHe may try to convince your groom to make him change the groomsman order so that it looks deliberate that he has a different suit to the other groomsmen.", "If you want to be petty\u2026 and this won\u2019t ruin your wedding day for you and hubby\u2026. you say you could order one but do t have his size\u2026 order it three sizes to big. Make him look like a small child swallowed up in his clothing. He can be the running joke of the day\u2026.", "Idk support his brother by being a guest at least?? And bring them a gift for messing up so badly, it\u2019s his brother\u2026", "Yeah, showing up as a guest and having to honestly explain to others why he is no longer a groomsman is part of this whole atonement.", "Have you read any comments? She says over and over her SO is hurt and is hoping he won't even show.", "Honestly it\u2019s the lies that would bother me more. He lied the whole time to give them a false sense of security. Like you\u2019re not going to get caught! Maybe the end goal was to just not show, like OP said they fear. It\u2019s such a toddler reaction. I hope he\u2019s just lied again and doesn\u2019t really plan on driving up.", "NTA 100%\n\nInfo: This is purely out of curiosity because I saw he wasn't bestman. Could he be trying to punish his brother because he wasn't made bestman and doing this all out of spite? Monumental AH, even if not the case and a shit excuse, was just wondering.", "NTA, but I will be...does he even need to attend. His behavior shows contempt for the proceedings. \nCongratulations \ud83c\udf89", "God almighty. You people and weddings. If you can't sort it out now don't have kids bc you'll be divorced.  So stupid. You're all the assholes. Wear a fkn condom", "NTA", "YWBTA to remove one of your husbands groomsmen.   this should be your husbands decision imo. His family, his groomsmen. If he doesn't want Drew in the wedding he needs to be the one to handle it. Wedding are about more than the look/pictures . Aren't they supposed to be about family", "NTA no suit no role. Make sure you have someone else giving his speech too. I doubt he prepared one anyway.", "In the fairness of the world anyone who wants you to wear a certain outfit should also pay for it. Which you were 100% ready to do. So ntah. Bil sucks so much. Sorry about that. Demote him to guest because that is all he could afford from his personal time. It's no big deal.", "NTA for not wanting him, but you would be the asshole if you make this decision. It should be completely up to your fiance. It's his brother."]}
