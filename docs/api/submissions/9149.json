Now I\u2019m a fairly messy person and I don\u2019t need to have our place look like a model home, but Mark\u2019s dog, \u201cRex\u201d(2.5) is making me consider ending the relationship entirely unless something changes. It seems that every other time I go to Mark\u2019s place Rex always either pees, poops, or pukes somewhere in the house. Mark also allows Rex to crawl around under the sheets, which I think is nasty considering poop often gets stuck in his fur. Last night Rex ended up pooping on the bed, then immediately crawling under the sheets, and leaving a huge shit streak all over everything while we were in it and I lost it. I told Mark that it\u2019s nasty he continues to let this happen and he needs to be more on top of letting his dog out. He said it only happens because he \u201cgets excited\u201d and that he lets him out enough. I suggested using bells by the door and teaching Rex to tap them when he needs to go out but he insists those are unnecessary. By that point I had enough and gave Mark and ultimatum: I would not consider moving in with him until Rex is completely house trained or he finds a new home for him. Mark said I was being unreasonable and mean by making him choose between me and his dog. Was I out of line for this? Neither my mom or I think so. \n\nInfo: The dog is 2.5 years and we\u2019ve been long distance until about 3 months ago so I didn\u2019t know about this until recently. Mark claims he takes Rex out enough but I can\u2019t know how often as we don\u2019t live together. \n\nRex is NOT a bad dog otherwise.

They poop inside bc they\u2019re not properly cared for.

But let me be clear on why. You two have been dating for approximately 2 years and his dog is 2.5, which means he has had this dog the length of your relationship and that Rex was a baby when you two started dating. \n\nI agree with a lot of the above comments regarding re-homing Rex may be a tad too far, but mostly because I don\u2019t think you\u2019re asking him to do it for the right reason. If you\u2019ve been dating for 2 years, I assume you spend a lot of time together. Rex should be used to by now. So either Rex has a behavioral or medical issue (or is simply neglected) and you seem to be unconcerned except in how it impacts you living with your BF. If I was dating someone who I believed neglected their dog (you indicate you have told him to take Rex out more) such that the dog had accidents EVERY time I was over, they wouldn\u2019t have made it 2 years into a relationship with me. If you\u2019re considering moving in together, I would also hope you would see Rex as your dog as well (or at least your step-dog of some sort) and be concerned for his well being. But your concern seems to be how it will impact you, so that\u2019s why I think you\u2019re a bit of an asshole. \n\nYou absolutely are right that he should be taking Rex to a trainer (or maybe a vet to rule out some sort of other issue if this is a frequent occurrence) and tour BF is the asshole that he isn\u2019t concerned and seems to be fine with the frequent accidents. It would be one thing if Rex got overexcited when you came in and peed a tiny amount from excitement, but this seems like more than just excitement. Additionally, I assume you spend a lot of time there, so it\u2019s not the same as an infrequent trip that is overexciting. Your BF needs to sort out the issues his dog is having for the sake of his dog. He also needs to make sure his dog\u2019s needs are met. If that means taking the dog out more, he should suck it up.\n\nIf he\u2019s not capable of (or willing to) taking care of his dog, then he SHOULD consider rehoming him, but it should be in the dog\u2019s best interests and not because he wants you to move in. Quite frankly, I\u2019m not sure I would move in with someone who rehomed a dog after 2+ years simply because he wanted me to move in and couldn\u2019t be bothered to try to deal with the dog\u2019s medical or behavioral issues. \n\nSo yeah, ESH.", "NTA \n\nBECAUSE you also told him that he could house train the dog... Well you can also be part of this... And I'm kind of curious if he goes on walks with the dog? A real walk at least 30 minuts once a day can't be exchanged with going in the garden so if he don't walk his dog and dog feces get on furniture i also think the dog might be better off in another home?... Also you can try to agree on no dogs in the furniture? Have a dog bed next to the bed or something... \nHow old is the dog? It could sound as if it is sick so if it's an elderly dog then of course he shouldn't get rid of it but it could also be sick from wrong food?", "As a dog owner and lover NTA. I have a long haired German shepherd, I love him like my kids however, I find it DISGUSTING that people let animals on their beds! I\u2019m constantly cleaning because my house feels nasty with a dog in it. I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from, I simply could not and would not live like that, my dogs fully trained and never has accidents inside. Asking him to rehome his dog is a bit fair but if he\u2019s not willing to train it then I\u2019d definitely be ending the relationship.", "ESH\n\nYou might have taken it a bit too far by suggesting he rehome his dog...\n\nHe on the other hand needs to properly train his dog to do his \"business\" outside.", "ESH. It's wrong of you to ask that. It's wrong of him not to train and groom his dog.", "YTA. My dog gets excited and has accidents as well. He can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s completely house trained. Every time we go in PetsMart. He shits on the floor due to excitement despite we just walked past 7 patches of grass. That\u2019s how dogs are.

He should be training him better. Anyone who wants to or gets rid of an animal after the animal has become family and bonded with their owner is a huge AH. I\u2019d never part with my pet for someone\u2026 but I also wouldn\u2019t want to live with someone dirty like this. I once dated a cat dude who would leave litter and the cats food everywhere in his room and it was just foul. I couldn\u2019t do it.", "NTA. This dog seems to have an anxiety disorder that could be medically treated with the help of a veterinarian. \n\nYou didn\u2019t say that BF has to get rid of the dog. You also mentioned house training Rex.", "NTA that's so unsanitary. While rehoming is extreme, he needs to do some serious training", "ESH. \n\nWhile the dog clearly needs some training, giving your Bf an ultimatum about rehoming the dog was not okay. Neither is your bf letting the dog shit everywhere. Dogs can pee a little as an act of submission when \u201cexcited.\u201d They don\u2019t shit themselves. \n\nGot that dog to the vet ASAP. Yikes all around.", "I dare you to ask your boyfriend how does he wash his ass or how often he does sheets. I think you\u2019ll find your answer on whether to stay with him or not there.", "NTA- I went into this post fully expecting you to be the A but no, that dog is gross and I couldn\u2019t live with that. I\u2019m honestly surprised you stay at his house in that situation", "NTA.  The ultimatum that he claimed was choosing \u201cyou or his dog\u201d was really : choose \u201ctrain/take care of your dog properly or I\u2019m not moving in\u201d.    He can reword it for maximum drama but he just don\u2019t want to put in the effort because he doesn\u2019t mind living with filth.", "NTA You do realise that the poop is all over Mark too? In fact it\u2019s probably transferred over the whole house. This is exactly why some people don\u2019t wear shoes in the house - they don\u2019t want to be spreading poo bacteria about. Unless you break up with Mark, you are going to have poo on you for life.", "I was all set to say YTA but naw, dogs, if properly trained and are taken care of do not shit and piss in the house. You still have to deal with it if the pet is sick but bf sounds like he's not taking care of that poor dog. I'd call animal control. The dog deserves better. If you guys have kids it could easily be him not taking care of them.\n\nNTA.", "YTA because this is a boyfriend problem not a dog problem. Is your bf taking proper care of the dog ? Taking it outside to pee and poop, feeing it proper food and training it ? If the dog\u2019s not taken outside of course it\u2019ll poop on the floor\u2026", "NTA. Keep the dog, rehome the boyfriend.", "NTA. He has the opportunity to train his dog as part of the deal. He should also consider taking the dog to the vet to rule out medical issues.", "NTA, but take it as a warning sign and get a new bf", "Cut ties. You don\u2019t want to tie yourself to anyone who is ok with living like this. Dogs have accidents - it happens. But good owners are willing to put in the work and are looking for ways to train their dog and improve the situation. It\u2019s not good for the dog or owner. Dogs don\u2019t naturally want to poo where they sleep. \n\nImagine how unhygienic he is in other areas of his life\u2026", "Dogs cannot control when they vomit, but if the dog is vomiting that much and having loose stools I would be having the dog tested for parasites and or allergies checked.\n\nOther than that NTA if Rex is having issues potty training he needs to be crated when not being closely monitored my 4 month old puppy already tells me when she has to go out by nudging the back door and sitting at it", "I'm on the fence.  I've had my dogs vomit on me while sleeping.  I've had my dogs have accidents in the house.  I've also had a boyfriend give me that same ultimatum; the dogs stayed and he was rehomed.\n\nWas I grossed out by it; hell yeah.  Did make a huge dramatic scene out of it; no.\n\nPlus, you said you were messy.  So I have a difficult time with being sympathetic here.  You can be messy but the dog can't have an accident without a freak out.  But I also feel like there is a lot details that have been left out.", "NTA at 2.5 years old that dog should be trained I know some dogs do get excited and pee but it seems your bf is lazy because no dog is doing all that if they are taken out enough I have a dog and I don\u2019t know if your bf has carpet or not but that\u2019s not a smell I would want in my house either", "NTA.\n\nThis is about him neglecting his poor dog. I don't say dump him, but I'd think twice if he ever starts talking about having kids.", "As a dog lover, having a house-trained dog is a completely reasonable expectation. And if the dog is incontinent then it wears diapers. All of that is as much for the dog's health and safety as it is for the human's.", "Let the dog find a better human too.", "Oh so it\u2019s just neglected\u2026 NTA tell the shelter he got it from", "Like I totally get what you're saying, but at the same time, there are definitely circumstances where someone can be not grossed out by that stuff and it isn't a red flag. Anyone who works in the pet industry has seen their fair share of excrement, so it might not be a big deal, just another thing to clean up and move on lol.  But IDK if OP's boyfriend is in the pet industry, and the fact that he doesn't want to train the dog seems like he's just lazy.", "You've got a doxie dont you", "dalmatian mix \ud83e\udd23 he's my problem child lol", "Ahhh, as you can guess mine is a foot long torpedo keen on toy destruction"]}
