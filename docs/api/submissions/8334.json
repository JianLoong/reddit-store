She may 'start trying soon' and is still on birth control? NTA she may NEVER have a kid", "NTA.  It's your child, name him whatever you want to.\n\nIt's ridiculous for your sister to 'reserve' a name when a) she isn't pregnant, and b) the name has no real significance other than she likes it.", "NTA- you were honest given the name had strong connections to BF\u2019s family that you couldn\u2019t make that promise. Infertility is a very emotional journey but doesn\u2019t excuse her reaction. I hope with support your sister can see you are not being unreasonable", "NTA. She spoke too late, the name was already short-listed. After her tantrum I'd be petty enough to name the kid that anyways. I'd suggest using it as a middle name but, because you'd already considered it and have good reasons for it, I have no issue with you using it as a first name either. You didn't go \"Oh, I like that name too! I'm going to name my kid that!\". Coincidence but that's life. She, however, is acting like a total TA. Throwing a book? Sorry, there's NO excuse for THAT.", "NTA. \n\nHoney, you should go NC with your sister.\n\nThrowing shit at you because she's not pregnant yet shows how unstable she is.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t own the rights to any names and you have the ability to choose what to name your child. if she\u2019s getting that physically upset/violent over a name, you don\u2019t need her around you or your child.", "Nta. No one has the right to a name. The only case I'd say not to use a name is if they had a child who died with that name. Because not everyone wants someone to memorialize their deceased child. \n\nIt would seem she is probably coming to terms with that she may not have biological children. But that doesn't give her the right to throw a book at you.", "NTA\n\nHer reaction shows how much she likes you.\nWhy should you do anything for her?", "NTA.  Names do not have patents on them.  They are free to be used by anyone, especially, if it is your bf's and his grandfather's.  Your sister is acting very immaturely.", "NTA\n\nNormally if the name means something to the other party then I think it's all about respect but the name actually means something to YOU and your partner, and not to your sister. She has two names, she better use that other one.", "NTA. She doesn't get to dictate what name another couple can use. There are obviously sadness and/or jealousy issues going on and she shouldn't be taking them out on you.", "NTA. You can name your child any name you would like to be called.", "Boy will she be shocked to learn that there are thousands, millions even, of other people all around the world with that very name. NTA. She doesn\u2019t own the name, and she can\u2019t call dibs either. \n\nFor the sake of argument, let\u2019s say dibs on a name could be called. You are pregnant, she is not. Your husband\u2019s side of the family has history with that name, she nor her bf\u2019s family has any known history with this name. If anything you and your husband deserve dibs on this name, not her. If she wants to run away because she doesn\u2019t get her way, then let her, because she doesn\u2019t sound like a very good sister.", "NTA, LOL at the audacity of you sister, it\u2019s literally a family name in your husbands family.", "NTA.

Name your son whatever you want.", "No. You can\u2019t gate keep names.", "NTA! She has no right to reserve a name for any potential child she may have. She is AH for verbally and physically abusing you! She is free to move across the country. Last time I heard, a sister is NOT involved in a \"pregnancy process.\"", "NTA. And for what it\u2019s worth, I have 2 cousins on the same side of the family who are both named James. I get that most people don\u2019t want to do that. There is a potential for confusion and the second person looks like they copied but she technically can still use the name - if she even has a boy. She doesn\u2019t have the right to stop you from using it. I suspect this is probably about much more. She\u2019s 37 and might be very stressed about her fertility, and may be a bit jealous that you are pregnant.", "Reserving a name?! How ridiculous!! Clearly there's a lot more going on than a baby name here... \n\nYou're NTA though.", "NTA. It\u2019s your baby! Name him whatever fits him and your family.

You can\u2019t ban people from naming their children a certain name just because you like it.", "NTA\nNames aren\u2019t books- you don\u2019t get to put them on hold.

Use any name you like", "NTA\n\nNobody owns a name. Multiple people, in the same family even, can have the same name. The world still turns.\n\nHeck, I have a half-brother with the same first name as me.", "NTA. She didn\u2019t patent the name. Help her look for places to move to. You\u2019ll be better off.", "People do not own names!! Name your kid whatever you want.\n\nNTA", "NTA. And I know it's not for everyone, but at 37 she should start seriously considering adoption if they want a child", "NTA - nobody gets \"dibs\" on a name. You could name your kid the exact same thing and still wouldn't be the AH. This is such a stupid argument.", "NTA\n\nAnd I wonder if someone who has such a meltdown is mature enough to be a parent.  Seriously.  Grow up first. THEN have a child.", "NTA. Also, she threw a book at you. That\u2019s violent. You\u2019d likely be better off if she moves cross country and never visits, because you deserve better than to have books thrown at you.", "NTA you can't just reserve a name.\n\nAlso she isn't even pregnant and with 37 she slowly get's to a risky age for it.\n\nThrowing a book at someone a pregnant women at that is unhinged", "Cousins can have the same name. It isn't a problem at all.
