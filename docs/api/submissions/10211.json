I can\u2019t help but wonder what other things that matter to you are brushed aside by his disregard for your wishes", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've asked him several times not to refer to you as a bookkeeper, which is pretty reasonable, especially because you aren't a bookkeeper, your the founder of a business (congrats by the way... 25 employees is impressive, that's nothing to scoff at), but he keeps doing it anyways.  Seems like he's got a bit of misogynistic side to him but unfortunately that may not ever change.  \n\nSince he's an ex-military officer, you should start referring to him as a \"private\" and he'll see how you feel.", "NTA, and no, he\u2019s not joking when he talks down you.

How would he like it if you introduced him at a retired private? Or a couple of ranks below what he retired as?", "NTA. You're being continually disrespected in public and undermined by the man who should be bigging you up, who should be glad to have you with him. Life is too short to take this from anyone, least of all the man who presumably has said he loves you. He needs to start valuing and respecting you. How would he like to be introduced as \"A security guard\" instead of his military career being fully recognised?", "NTA - He's a retired military officer?  Start referring to him well below his rank and incorrectly state which branch he was in.
