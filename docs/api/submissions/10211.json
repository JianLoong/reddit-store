I can\u2019t help but wonder what other things that matter to you are brushed aside by his disregard for your wishes", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've asked him several times not to refer to you as a bookkeeper, which is pretty reasonable, especially because you aren't a bookkeeper, your the founder of a business (congrats by the way... 25 employees is impressive, that's nothing to scoff at), but he keeps doing it anyways.  Seems like he's got a bit of misogynistic side to him but unfortunately that may not ever change.  \n\nSince he's an ex-military officer, you should start referring to him as a \"private\" and he'll see how you feel.", "NTA, and no, he\u2019s not joking when he talks down you.

You're being continually disrespected in public and undermined by the man who should be bigging you up, who should be glad to have you with him. Life is too short to take this from anyone, least of all the man who presumably has said he loves you. He needs to start valuing and respecting you. How would he like to be introduced as \"A security guard\" instead of his military career being fully recognised?", "NTA - He's a retired military officer?  Start referring to him well below his rank and incorrectly state which branch he was in.

Doesn't matter that it isn't a big deal to him; it should matter because it's obviously a big deal to you - as it very well should be! He knows damn well what he's doing, he sounded extremely patronising with \"she has come a long way for a book-keeper\" and it's just outright an asshole move to talk you down in front of your family.

I\u2019m pretty disgusted by his comments, as it seems you\u2019ve worked incredibly hard to build a very successful business and should be recognized for your accomplishments.

That jerk is a walking red flag and is obviously having issues with your huge accomplishments.

He has issues and you can do so much better.", "Have you seen evidence of his service?  His comments make me feel he might be perpetuating a stolen valor scenario for himself.\n\nEdit: definitely NTA!\n\nAlso, in my experience, people that have to establish themselves as superior, rarely are.

Start introducing him as your friend since words and what they mean aren\u2019t important to him.", "He does this on purpose. He does this pointedly at this point.

Never could earn his stripes though ...\"", "Ex guard here. Odds are it won't help this one, but I'd be petty enough to refer to him as a private or any rank lower than his current one.

AH. OP, he is not going to change and doesn't want to. This is a major red flag, because it will only get worse if you get married and combine into one household.
