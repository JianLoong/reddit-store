I can\u2019t help but wonder what other things that matter to you are brushed aside by his disregard for your wishes", "NTA\n\nSounds like you've asked him several times not to refer to you as a bookkeeper, which is pretty reasonable, especially because you aren't a bookkeeper, your the founder of a business (congrats by the way... 25 employees is impressive, that's nothing to scoff at), but he keeps doing it anyways.  Seems like he's got a bit of misogynistic side to him but unfortunately that may not ever change.  \n\nSince he's an ex-military officer, you should start referring to him as a \"private\" and he'll see how you feel.", "NTA, and no, he\u2019s not joking when he talks down you.

You're being continually disrespected in public and undermined by the man who should be bigging you up, who should be glad to have you with him.

I moved across the country by myself to a state where I knew ONE person and did it all on my own.  My health has always tripped me up.  my life derailed when my multiple rare, chronic, genetic, chronic, incurable conditions started flaring.  I was still going to work with a hole that had been drilled into my kidney wit a stent that emptied into a bag that was strapped to my leg, since I'd had so many kidney stone surgeries my kidney needed months to recover each time I had to have another surgery.  I was killing myself to work at a very high stress, physically demanding job where I'd work 12 hours without a break, ride the subway home, and cry from pain in exhaustion as I lay in bed. My husband would berate me for not going out to the bar for a drink with all our friends, despite the fact I couldn't drink, I was in agony, and I had to work again the next day. \n\nHe kept up the front for a while, but I slowly came to accept that the man I fell in love with never existed.  He never once could empathize with the agony of 30+ surgeries.  I was in too much pain, trying to pull my share, feeling like a failure because I wasn't a good wife.  I couldn't clean and go out, I couldn't have children.  I couldn't bear the pain of being touched, and even knowing that, would force intimacy, and would not stop until I asked him, knowing he was hurting me, knowing it destroyed me when I had to ask him to stop.  He did it on purpose because it was one more thing he could beat me down with.  Friends had told me he wasn't a good man, but I hadn't seen it.  \n\nI can't go back through all the humiliations. Your fianc\u00e9 is threatened by the thought that anyone could see you as an independent, successful woman in your own right.  There is no other reason in the world for him to keep doing what he's doing.   Perhaps you should flip the script and see how he likes being introduced for something he did 20 years ago.  I could never figure out why my husband could never put himself in my shoes, and thought he just didn't care enough to.  Actually he's incapable of it.  He's the only one with feelings.  He's the one that is always right.  That is not an exaggeration, in ten years of marriage, he apologized to me once.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 does not value you, except in the ways you make him look good to others, but not outshine him.  I know it's such a jumble of hurt and emotions, but he's old enough to understand your requests.  He's intelligent enough to know why you ask this of him, and to continue to embarrass and belittle you in front of others.  \n\nI don't want anyone to go through what I did.  Then there are the well meaning friends.  \"I can't believe how much you've changed!  You're the last person I ever thought would allow someone to be abusive with you.  I can't believe you let him do this . . .\"  Except it started differently.  He had been my best friend.  We used to laugh all the time, until we didn't.  \n\nHe destroyed everything once he'd gotten me to keep working and put him through college. Then he'd get a better paying job and I could finally get on disability.  He cheated, he stole, he left me in foreclosure with 2 weeks before eviction and 6 months of mortgage payments I had earned in his accounts.  I'm so sick, especially after COVID, I can't even bend over without my severe gastric problems putting me in bed or a hospital.  What is your opinion of a man who could see all that suffering, forcing myself to work, and just walk away, leaving it all to fall on me?
