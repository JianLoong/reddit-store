All afternoon  they were kind of lagging on making plans and after about five hours we decided we would be hanging out at my house. \n\nAfter that one of my friends (I\u2019ll call him ethan) decided he wanted to hang out at his house so we decided we could all just go to his house. Ethan said in the group chat before we came over that he wanted someone to bring him a burrito, and he would pay back whoever picked up the burrito for him. \n\nI said I would bring him a burrito if he paid for my burrito too. No one else in the group chat bothered to even respond. Ethan refused the offer and just insisted that I brought him a burrito. I then renegotiated my offer and said I would bring him a burrito if he would pay for half of mine. \n\nHe still refused this offer and began getting upset after I pointed out that he was the one who asked for a burrito in the first place. He was asking me why I wouldn\u2019t just go get him a burrito, and I explained that I\u2019m trying to save money right now and if I go pick him up a burrito, it\u2019ll make me want one, but I can\u2019t spend money on that at the moment. After that, he just dropped it and decided to get food himself, but was upset. \n\nAfter my two other friends and I were all at his house, my other friends took Ethan\u2019s side and told me I was in the wrong for asking him to pay for mine if I went out of my way to pick it up. \n\nI kept saying he asked in the group chat for it and they didn\u2019t even bother to respond. Ethan said he would have preferred no response at all, and I relented and said I wouldn\u2019t do it again in the future, but we still had an argument about it.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683777031, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ec92o/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_pay_for_my_burrito/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The sticking point seems to be your budget, but that's not on him. Hypothetically, if you could splurge for a burrito and going there isn't out of your way, picking up one for him (assuming he pays you back) is what friends do.\n\nIf your budget could afford one, would you still ask him to cover half?", "YTA. The first time he refused your offer, you should've dropped it.", "YTA. I agree I would rather have a friend not respond than to offer to charge me for grabbing the food. It\u2019s just a friendly thing to do that you\u2019re turning weirdly transactional. Either do your friend the favor or say nothing", "YTA", "Lol.\nWhat a dumb argument.\n\nNTA to me. Why should someone do him a favor of buying him a burrito? Tell him you are willing to pretend to be Ubereats and charge him for delivery then.", "In the end NAH/NTA\n\nEthan sounds like a lot, changing plans to have you guys come to his place and then ask you to go out of the way to bring him food.

Other means to acquire the burrito was put forth, as it related to the original request, and it was fine of him to decline. No need for butthurt here."]}
