Both my mom and dad are 30 now. When my parents graduated high school my dad got his real estate license but my mom decided to go to college. So I lived with my dad during that time because I couldn\u2019t go with her. Where my mom went to school was only a 45 minute drive so she would visit me on weekends. I remember how much fun it was getting time to spend with my mom on weekends and wishing she was around more often. My parents broke up not too long before my mom went to college but my mom ended up meeting \u201cH\u201d (m31) and they started dating. \n\nMy mom was going to come back home after she finished college. But she ended up moving 3 1/2 hours away with H. My dad ended up taking her to court for custody, she now pays child support and is supposed to have every other weekend with me. Which went on for a couple years but then H and her got married and had a little girl together. So she stopped coming around or inviting me over to her house because she was too busy. \n\nWell yesterday she came down to her parents house and told me to come over because she has a surprise. I went over this morning and she showed me a ultrasound she\u2019s pregnant with another girl. I lost it and started crying because I\u2019ve always felt replaced since my half sister was born. She gets the life I never had with my mom. She asked if I was happy\u2026 I said not really you replaced me once already now it\u2019s happening again. She tried saying she isn\u2019t replacing me I just said well I feel replaced you never see me. I got texts from both my grandparents and H calling me a brat and selfish, saying I\u2019m too old to be acting jealous over a new baby.

This letter should go to all who are critical of you and your feelings, including your dad.  These adults think that \"time\" heals these wounds of neglect and abandonment, but they do NOT.

You mom is TA for not being there for you like she should have been.", "NTA you're not jealous of a younger sibling. You're grieving because your mom never treated you right and is choosing to give her time to a new child rather than try to make up for lost time with you.

You expressed it very maturely.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nBabies and young children do take time and keep parents busy but it sounds like your mother just completely removed you from her life when she had another child. It's common for siblings to feel jealousy over a new baby but this is an entirely different situation. Even if your mother didn't completely replace you these feelings are valid and your grandparents and H are definitely AHs for calling you a selfish brat. And your mother is an AH, but I think you knew that already.\n\nI'm going to second what others have already mentioned and recommend seeing a therapist. It sounds like you have several years of pain to work through. I'm really sorry you're going through this, OP, but I'm glad your dad's in your corner at least.", "NTA and I'm so sorry. How she could justify leaving you for her boyfriend, when she could've at any point worked on getting a place closer to you, is unbelievable. And then expecting you to be happy when she's having another kid, and didn't even stick around for you? Pure stupidity.\n\nI think once your half sister is older she'll agree with you, i don't think this is a behavior your mom will grow out of.", "NTA . Your feelings are natural.

I think you need to surround yourself with the people have shown you love and have prioritized you and realize that this is how your relationship is with your mom.
