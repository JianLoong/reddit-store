Both my mom and dad are 30 now. When my parents graduated high school my dad got his real estate license but my mom decided to go to college. So I lived with my dad during that time because I couldn\u2019t go with her. Where my mom went to school was only a 45 minute drive so she would visit me on weekends. I remember how much fun it was getting time to spend with my mom on weekends and wishing she was around more often. My parents broke up not too long before my mom went to college but my mom ended up meeting \u201cH\u201d (m31) and they started dating. \n\nMy mom was going to come back home after she finished college. But she ended up moving 3 1/2 hours away with H. My dad ended up taking her to court for custody, she now pays child support and is supposed to have every other weekend with me. Which went on for a couple years but then H and her got married and had a little girl together. So she stopped coming around or inviting me over to her house because she was too busy. \n\nWell yesterday she came down to her parents house and told me to come over because she has a surprise. I went over this morning and she showed me a ultrasound she\u2019s pregnant with another girl. I lost it and started crying because I\u2019ve always felt replaced since my half sister was born. She gets the life I never had with my mom. She asked if I was happy\u2026 I said not really you replaced me once already now it\u2019s happening again. She tried saying she isn\u2019t replacing me I just said well I feel replaced you never see me. I got texts from both my grandparents and H calling me a brat and selfish, saying I\u2019m too old to be acting jealous over a new baby.

This letter should go to all who are critical of you and your feelings, including your dad.  These adults think that \"time\" heals these wounds of neglect and abandonment, but they do NOT.

That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to need you to be saying now\u2026 nothing.\u201d", "I want to hug this kid so badly.", "Was thinking the same.", "Yeah OP, they might have realized they want your help being the babysitter now and also maybe pay less child support on you. Stand your ground dude, you don't need to go anywhere you don't want. Take care", "I'm so sorry that your mother failed you. It's a terrible thing to go through and you deserve so much better than that. \n\nJust know that your daddy very clearly loves you with all his heart. While it can be important to have both parents in your life, it's not the only important thing. It can be just as important to have only one parent, one who truly loves you unconditionally. \n\nYour mom clearly doesn't know how to prioritize. She clearly doesn't know how to show proper love and support. And she probably has narcissistic tendencies (I believe that because she automatically expected you to be happy for her even though she abandoned you). This is not at all a reflection of you or your worth! You are amazing! You deserve to be happy! Your feelings are always valid because they are YOUR feelings! And you deserve to be loved entirely, not half-assed like she has been. I agree with PP, tell her parents and her husband to kick rocks. They weren't there when she failed you the first time and they have no right to inject themselves into it this time. \n\nI pray that your dad finds a good woman to be your mom and fill any void you may be feeling, but even if he doesn't, you are growing up into a fine woman. Despite your mother's shortcomings. Please, hold on to that! Good luck and sending lots of love and hugs to you and your daddy! May y'all remain healthy, safe, and hopefully happy!", "And basically the question would be \u201care you happy for mom\u201d\n\nIf OP never gets to visit or see the little sibs then why would her feelings matter. Poor kid.", "No, there is no excuse. As a mother myself there is zero way that I could only see my child 2 times in 3years. Zero. My son was visiting his grandmother out of state once and told me he missed me and wanted to come home. I went through hell getting the money and transportation to be there that day despite having an infant and toddler with me. HUGE inconvenience. He would have been safe and cared for, but I went anyway. You deserve that. You are just as  important. You did not deserve this. She wasn\u2019t a mother to you . Your feelings are valid and SHE, not you, owes an apology and should be ashamed.", "I\u2019m almost relieved for OP that didn\u2019t happen.  She would have been at high risk to be parentified.  And she doesn\u2019t need that on top of feeling replaced.  She deserves much better than she\u2019s been given by mom and her flying monkey brigade.  I\u2019m so glad her father is doing such a great job.  I guess he was also just a teenager and in his case, he matured into his role beautifully.", "Her mom should atleast be thankful to OP (her daughter) that she still consider her as her mom, despite of being irresponsible. I wouldn't be surprise if someday her hopes will just go away and doesn't care anymore. That choice will definitely give her peace.", "They really do, had the same experience when I stood up to my uncle for giving me slave wages when I worked with him. Ever since I got a decent paying job he got cold with me, he didn't like how he lost his only worker. He had a really good season 1 year and mentioned to my sister how much money I would have made with him. My sis told him how much I make and that shut him up real quick. Now I make more in one month then I ever did working for him for five seasons, it made me realize how much he screwed me over. The wages were justified because we were \"family.\"", "This comment unexpectedly just made me start straight up bawling even though I thought I was all out of tears. I just found out 2 days ago that my poor Daddio\u2019s body is being slowly eaten to death by two different, unrelated cancers and he has about 6-12 months to live (**with** chemo.) After my mom died when I was a young girl, he\u2019s been my rock through life and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do without him, even though I\u2019m 35 with three daughters of my own. I\u2019m so fucking lost and heartbroken and angry. He is only 64, and has always been so active and healthy, and he and his sweet wife are the best grandparents my kids have and it\u2019s just not fucking fair! Fuck cancer!!!", "I\u2019m so sorry. Big hugs \ud83e\udec2", "This made me tear up, I am so sorry you\u2019re going through this. And yes fuck cancer.", "Info why is it the copy past of a post from trueoutofmychest with minor details modified ?", "NTA. Fuck man, I wish I could give you a hug.", "Oh sweetheart, I'm so sorry your mother is so awful to you. You are completely entitled to feel abandoned and like your mother replaced you, because that's exactly what she did. She lost interest in you as soon as she had a fresh new baby in a picture perfect new family.\n\nAnyone calling you an A H is just trying to cover for her cruel behaviour. Your response wasn't jealousy, it was a natural expression of how much your mother's abandonment has hurt you over the years, and your perfectly rational expectation that it will only get worse from here. And she brought you over there to make the announcement as though it should be something you would welcome, after how she's treated you since the other baby came along? What narcissistic behaviour.\n\nYou are NTA, not even slightly. What she has done and is doing to you is cruel, and you don't deserve that. I'm glad your father is supporting you in this. You deserve a parent who values you for the special and unique person you are. I wish I could give you a hug. Just know that your feelings are legitimate. Do you have a therapist to talk to about this for support?", "This sounds oddly similar to another story I'd read here on Reddit some days ago...", "NTA your feelings are very valid and understandable and H can take his opinion elsewhere. As for your grandparents, they need to get a grip as well.", "NTA! Nobody gets to tell you how to express your trauma (as long as it's not physically hurting anyone else.) Your feelings and experiences are yours, certainly not theirs.", "NTA\n\nYour mother neglected you, and you have every right to be upset about it. \n\nFocus your energy on people who care about you, like your dad. He sounds like a great guy.", "Definitely not TA and I'm so sorry you've been made to feel this way. While I haven't had the exact same situation as you I can understand your feelings and frustration.", "NTA. I am so sorry you are going through this. I think this tells you what your mother is truly like and what she thinks of you. Take it from me as a mom, I am so sorry. \n\nAnd your dad sounds like a wonderful guy and I am so glad that you have him and he has you :)", "I am so sorry for you. \n\nI was abandoned at birth, and when I met my bio mom at 19, I discovered she had kept my sister (while abandoning me) so all this time she had raised and loved a daughter - just not me. \nIt was shattering. \n\nIt will get better one day I promise and even if you feel your lost childhood can never be repaired, it can. Just not with her. I repaired mine with my pupils (I\u2019m a teacher) and my own daughters. \n\nI send you all my love and support.", "NTA. You feel rejected because your mom actually has spent years pushing you away.\n\n NTA at all. Your grandparents are being ridiculous to imply that your feelings aren't valid.", "It\u2019s interesting to me, because my daughter is only 3 years older than OP, but I\u2019m 56.  OP\u2019s mom is young enough to be my daughter.  I\u2019m sitting here trying to imagine what head space the mother of a 15 year old who is only 30 herself must be in to do this kind of absent minded parenting.  \n\nI came to motherhood fully formed with decades of life experience and perspective and knowing how I wanted to parent.  But I\u2019ve known very young moms like my dear friend and my niece, who did just as well as I did at bonding with their children.  So it\u2019s not just the fact OP\u2019s mom was a teen mom.  So what went wrong here?  \n\nAnd I\u2019m guessing, as purely a rank amateur member of the peanut gallery, that her mother was still incredibly impressionable when she got with her current partner and he convinced her that her first daughter didn\u2019t really need her anymore and influenced her to focus on him and their kids.  He speaks with such contempt for OP\u2019s feelings and clearly never facilitated her mother being a part of her life after getting with him.  \n\nAdd to that the fact OP\u2019s mom had only a short time with her before she went away for college.  Then saw her intermittently.   They never really got to forge a bond that would withstand the kind of pernicious influence a selfish partner could and did wield. \n\nOf course we can\u2019t discount the influence of the grandparents.  They probably encouraged their daughter to diminish the importance of her first child compared to all the other things they had dreamed of for her.  And apparently they\u2019re still at it. \n\nOP\u2019s mom is not absolved of responsibility.  She\u2019s now an educated 30 year old woman.   There\u2019s no more excuse to hide her neglect. It\u2019s a disgrace if she doesn\u2019t recognize she owes her firstborn much better than this.", "Some people are also just nuts or put themselves first all the time (narcissistic).", "I think she has a good relationship with her dad according to her stories. I'm sure as she experienced in the past she will never ever do that if she became a mother someday. I may not know her but I think she's a wonderful person. Imagine treating shitty by her mom and grandparents, still showed up and never planned to take revenge for doing that so.", "And give it time. When her mum needs a babysitter at the last minute, OP will be expected to drop everything and watch those kids. She'll be guilted into it if she doesn't.\n\nHere's to her dad as he continues to be a great parent to her.\n\nNTA", "This made me tear up, I am so sorry you\u2019re going through this. And yes fuck cancer.", "Complete fucking unfair bullshit. I'm so sorry. Big hugs.", "Thank you so much.", "Thank you, I appreciate that more than you know. This just really sucks, and it\u2019s so unexpected and out of left field. We just saw him over Halloween, so healthy and strong. And now this?! Fuck. I can\u2019t do this.", "Thank you so much. It REALLY is so unfair. I don\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t know which would be worse: this horrid, awful reality of watching him suffer in extreme pain and sickness and slowly die over the next several months, or him dying suddenly from something like a heart attack (or suicide like my mom.) I don\u2019t want to be angry but I am so, SO fucking furious\u2026 there are so many shitty people this could happen to, WHY him?! Ugh. \n\nSorry for the rant. I don\u2019t think I can handle this."]}
