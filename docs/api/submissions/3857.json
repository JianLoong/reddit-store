Both my mom and dad are 30 now. When my parents graduated high school my dad got his real estate license but my mom decided to go to college. So I lived with my dad during that time because I couldn\u2019t go with her. Where my mom went to school was only a 45 minute drive so she would visit me on weekends. I remember how much fun it was getting time to spend with my mom on weekends and wishing she was around more often. My parents broke up not too long before my mom went to college but my mom ended up meeting \u201cH\u201d (m31) and they started dating. \n\nMy mom was going to come back home after she finished college. But she ended up moving 3 1/2 hours away with H. My dad ended up taking her to court for custody, she now pays child support and is supposed to have every other weekend with me. Which went on for a couple years but then H and her got married and had a little girl together. So she stopped coming around or inviting me over to her house because she was too busy. \n\nWell yesterday she came down to her parents house and told me to come over because she has a surprise. I went over this morning and she showed me a ultrasound she\u2019s pregnant with another girl. I lost it and started crying because I\u2019ve always felt replaced since my half sister was born. She gets the life I never had with my mom. She asked if I was happy\u2026 I said not really you replaced me once already now it\u2019s happening again. She tried saying she isn\u2019t replacing me I just said well I feel replaced you never see me. I got texts from both my grandparents and H calling me a brat and selfish, saying I\u2019m too old to be acting jealous over a new baby.

This letter should go to all who are critical of you and your feelings, including your dad.  These adults think that \"time\" heals these wounds of neglect and abandonment, but they do NOT.

Or just rarely?", "Not so much an a hole but yeah, but old to be jealous of a baby. Was your mom just never supposed to have a family?", "Watch mom try to \u201cfix it\u201d by having OP over more and then using her as a free babysitter while mom and step dad go out. \n\nOP you are NTA. You were done dirty by a lazy mom and your feelings are valid. I\u2019m sorry you are going through this. Every child deserves to be wanted, loved and to spend time with both parents. I\u2019m truly sorry that your mom isn\u2019t pulling out her A game for you and I hope your dad can give you the support you need.", "That being said , you sound like a well balanced young person.", "OP WAS abandoned. \n\nWhat the hell is this \"you feel\", \"you probably\" and \"unable to\" garbage?\n\nOP should get therapy yes, but not because there's a \"hole in her soul\". What even is that characterisation, it's a complete misdirection of blame.\n\nOP should get therapy because she is dealing with very understandable abandonment issues BECAUSE HER MOTHER ABANDONED HER.\n\nNot because her mother is \"unable or unwilling\" to fill a hole in her soul, not because OP \"feels\" neglected and not because OP was \"probably\" neglected.\n\nSeriously dude, wtf is your wording, you've really gone out of your way to do some weird shit.", "Or you know\u2026Mom abandoning her?", "He didn\u2019t agree with them he agreed with me", "Her mom doesn't spend any time with her and hasn't since she found a new husband and had her new child. The mom basically abandoned her. This isn't a matter of teenage maturity. She feels replaced for pretty obvious reasons.", "So my half sister is 3 , I\u2019ve seen my mom 2 times since my half sister was born\u2026 you could blame Covid for a little bit of time but still", "This!", "Just wanting to second you finding a therapist.\n\nYour dad sounds great, but you deserve more than just one person in your corner telling you your feelings are valid!  The fact that your mother, her parents and her new husband all decided to make you feel guilty for reasonably expressing yourself means going forward, as new things happen, you will have an uphill battle trusting yourself and your feelings, surrounded by people who don't respect you, and won't take your side.\n\nA therapist can help you work through the fact that your mother is probably never going to give you the support you need and deserve as her daughter.  It's a lot to absorb at 15!\n\nAdults of neglectful parents are more likely to fall in abusive dynamics with romantic partners, and while you have your father there in your corner, I'd hate to see your mother's treatment inadvertently effect all your relationships for the next 10-15 years!  \n\nConsider a therapist as pre-emptively working on yourself so you don't have issues down the road!  \n\nAnd Good job speaking up to your mother about how you feel!  She needs to hear the truth, just as much as you need to express it!", "A therapist is a great idea. I saw my cousin go through the same thing as you. If I had to explain it, it is like the 5 stages of grief. You start angry, but you eventually accept that your parent (your mom) does not care for you.  \n  \nAnd then it is up to you how much of your mom you want in your life. A distant friend or blocked communication, it is up to you.", "Yeah, what the fuck is with everyone characterising it as OPs \"feelings\", as if someone accidentally insulted her or something.", "Did you tell that to your grandparents?", ">as new things happen, you will have an uphill battle trusting yourself and your feelings, surrounded by people who don't respect you, and won't take your side.\n\nThis is true, I'm living proof.", "Sorry, agree with absolutely everythign you say, but it seems Mother isnt gaslighting her, and its just the grand-parents*", "That you recognize that and defend him is a great sign of your character. :) Best of luck to you both.\n\nScrew your mom. Adults just hate being called on their shit. NTA."]}
