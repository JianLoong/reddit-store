Both my mom and dad are 30 now. When my parents graduated high school my dad got his real estate license but my mom decided to go to college. So I lived with my dad during that time because I couldn\u2019t go with her. Where my mom went to school was only a 45 minute drive so she would visit me on weekends. I remember how much fun it was getting time to spend with my mom on weekends and wishing she was around more often. My parents broke up not too long before my mom went to college but my mom ended up meeting \u201cH\u201d (m31) and they started dating. \n\nMy mom was going to come back home after she finished college. But she ended up moving 3 1/2 hours away with H. My dad ended up taking her to court for custody, she now pays child support and is supposed to have every other weekend with me. Which went on for a couple years but then H and her got married and had a little girl together. So she stopped coming around or inviting me over to her house because she was too busy. \n\nWell yesterday she came down to her parents house and told me to come over because she has a surprise. I went over this morning and she showed me a ultrasound she\u2019s pregnant with another girl. I lost it and started crying because I\u2019ve always felt replaced since my half sister was born. She gets the life I never had with my mom. She asked if I was happy\u2026 I said not really you replaced me once already now it\u2019s happening again. She tried saying she isn\u2019t replacing me I just said well I feel replaced you never see me. I got texts from both my grandparents and H calling me a brat and selfish, saying I\u2019m too old to be acting jealous over a new baby.

This letter should go to all who are critical of you and your feelings, including your dad.  These adults think that \"time\" heals these wounds of neglect and abandonment, but they do NOT.

Wild guess.", "If she can't care for her elder children she shouldn't make more", "Her mom was supposed to be a parent to her first kid instead of just dumping her on her dad and being absent.", "You are a sweet girl and this is one of those odd situations where despite being the child, you are more mature than your own mom. 30 or not, she\u2019s acting like a brat who only knows to think about herself and her needs. Everyone needs to be happy because she wants them to be happy, nevermind how her actions might affect others. \n\nAlso, (and I say this as someone older than your mom and H), your grandparents and H aren\u2019t entitled to say jack to you. Their overindulgence of her bad habits is why your mom is spoiled. And their selfishness and sloppiness towards you destroyed any credibility they might have had as your relatives. As far as society is concerned, all four of them can go pound sand.", "You shouldn't have to help out to have a place in your mother's family.  This is all on her.  She made choices to have the life that was easiest for her and those choices involved not being there for you.  Not at all your fault.  And you are allowed to feel whatever you feel.  You are not too old  - you're still a minor.", "Oh wow, you were even willing to be an active sister to her other child. Your mom really doesn\u2019t know what she gave up.", "They need to look at themselves that they would give you shit for being upset that your Mum basically abandoned you, and not her for said abandonment. \n\nI know you want that relationship with her so unless you two can do therapy or something I would really cut yourself from the heart ache and low to no contact. \n\nShe can\u2019t expect you give her praise for giving another human life what she refused to do for you. Refused being the optimal word because it was a choice.", "You have every right to feel like they replaced you, because that's precisely how they treated you.\n\nYour mother ought to be apologising to you, not getting the rest of her family to gang up on you. If she honestly didn't realise that's how you felt, her immediate reaction should be to comfort you and try to apologise for making you feel like that.", "Don\u2019t say that.  It\u2019s not a matter of you \u201cbeing able to help out\u201d.  That\u2019s not a reason.  Your mom and her entire side of the family are horrible.  You, OP, are NTA.", "At 15, OP is old enough to say no, she doesn't want to see her. I wouldn't blame her one bit if she went NC or LC with her mom. I feel really bad that her mom stopped giving her the love and attention she deserves. I'm glad she has a good dad.\n\nNTA", "\u201cIt doesn't matter how they hit you, all it matters how much it hurt you.\u201d\n\nThe OP \\*feels\\* the abandonment in a way in which someone else might have not felt it. (For example, someone else might have latched onto their father, or onto a grandmother - and not experienced - and get scarred - by being neglected the way OP did.) My phrasing was reflective of that personal experience.", "Exactly. Ops mom has clearly never taken responsibility or steps to address the hurt she caused op by putting her on the back burner in her life. OP is under no obligatiom to allow them to continue ignoring the giant abandonment shaped elephant in the room.", "Nope. You can\u2019t blame covid if she was only 3 hours away in the same country.\n\nIn most places the limits to covid movements still allowed for custody agreements to be maintained.\n\nEven the people I know who are super cautious and chose to have extended periods of time keeping kids in one house rather than moving between, when cases decreased they saw their kids. I know someone who was trapped overseas for work who was on the first flight home they could get. All of them did video chat, emails, text messages etc daily with their kids.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your mum chose to not make the effort to see you. You have every right to feel replaced because that\u2019s what your mum has done.\n\nPerhaps write a letter to your grandparents and point out how little your mother has seen you in 3 years and explain why you feel hurt.\n\nAlso your dad sounds great. Maybe ask if you can see a therapist (your school might have one) to help you process what is happening, it\u2019s sometimes good to have a impartial person to talk to.", "My dad bailed when I was 2. Found out 30 years later he went and had a whole new family after that. Sometimes shit happens, but crying and being jealous of a baby is absolutely not the way to handle this. Yes her mom should have been there more, but at the same time she acts like her mom was never ever supposed to move on and live her life.", "You shouldn't have to help out to have a place in your mother's family.", "Fuck outta here with this comment. Like seriously. You can move on and have a new family and STILL MAKE TIME FOR THE ONE YOU ALREADY HAVE. That is what a responsible adult and parent should do. Your father was an asshole and so is OP's mother.", "So happy you have your dad! Girls really need good dads \u2764\ufe0f", "Throw all your love at your dad and never take him for granted. He sounds like a wonderful person and I\u2019m happy for you that he\u2019s in your life", "I'm so glad that you have your Dad. I always wanted a daughter. You sound perfectly lovely.  Your mom is wrong for how she's treating you. Your Dad is right.  You continue to be the wonderful loving person that you are. You learn from her mistakes. If you decide to have children, you give them all the time love and attention possible.  Your mom's failures are not your fault. H, your grandparents and your mom are wrong. Shame on her for abandoning you.", "Im glad you have a good dad. My ex wife has a bf that she devotes all her time to, and completely ignores our two daughters and it breaks my heart. Shes always too tired or busy to do stuff with them, but is always willing to do whatever with bf. I hope that I can be half the father your dad seems to be! Give him a hug!\nEdit: oh and NTA!", "OP, don\u2019t ever let anyone make you feel bad for feeling bad. NTA.", ">a great sign of your character\n\nAnd her character in turn is a sign that her dad is in fact a great parent.\n\nOP, NTA.   You have every right to feel upset and that your mom is replacing you, because she did.   She should feel bad and maybe reflect on how her lack of involvement with you has hurt you.  As other commentators have mentioned the ones who are coming down on you should be called out for getting involved now and not when she stopped being your mother."]}
