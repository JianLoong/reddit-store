Both my mom and dad are 30 now. When my parents graduated high school my dad got his real estate license but my mom decided to go to college. So I lived with my dad during that time because I couldn\u2019t go with her. Where my mom went to school was only a 45 minute drive so she would visit me on weekends. I remember how much fun it was getting time to spend with my mom on weekends and wishing she was around more often. My parents broke up not too long before my mom went to college but my mom ended up meeting \u201cH\u201d (m31) and they started dating. \n\nMy mom was going to come back home after she finished college. But she ended up moving 3 1/2 hours away with H. My dad ended up taking her to court for custody, she now pays child support and is supposed to have every other weekend with me. Which went on for a couple years but then H and her got married and had a little girl together. So she stopped coming around or inviting me over to her house because she was too busy. \n\nWell yesterday she came down to her parents house and told me to come over because she has a surprise. I went over this morning and she showed me a ultrasound she\u2019s pregnant with another girl. I lost it and started crying because I\u2019ve always felt replaced since my half sister was born. She gets the life I never had with my mom. She asked if I was happy\u2026 I said not really you replaced me once already now it\u2019s happening again. She tried saying she isn\u2019t replacing me I just said well I feel replaced you never see me. I got texts from both my grandparents and H calling me a brat and selfish, saying I\u2019m too old to be acting jealous over a new baby.

Tell them to keep up that same energy.", "NTA. Your feelings are your feelings.  You are not being selfish.  You just want time with mom.

Hope your mom wishes up eventually.", "NTA, sorry you were neglected by your mom growing up. your mom and her family never prioritized you and that is not okay.

You deserve better. you and your dad are blessed to have each other.", "NTA. You have every right to your feelings and the truth hurts. Anyone in your situation would have been upset. I\u2019m sorry you went and are going through all of that.", "NTA you have a very complicated family situation and technically your mom isnt doing anything wrong being pregnant, but your feelings of feeling abandoned and replaced by your mom after she had your first sister and a second means even less attention would be given to you are valid.", "NTA. How you are feeling is valid and how you explained your situation I don't blame you for feeling that way. Talk to your dad about finding a therapist to work though your feelings.", "You feel neglected by your mother. You probably \\*were\\* neglected for most of your life - and nothing will change that. Even if she suddenly focused all her attention on you and you alone, the deprivation from the first 15 years of your life will still hurt.\n\nThere is a hole in there in your soul, which mother\u2019s care should have filled. Your mother is unwilling or unable to fill that hole - so you need different outlet. Ideally, ask to see a psychotherapist. Research one that specializes in abandonment issues. Confide in them. See where it takes you.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your mom has been a bad parent to you most of your life. She abandoned and neglected you. Of course you're going to have those feelings when she keeps adding more kids.\n\nIt's so good your dad is in your corner.

You even tried to express why and it doesn't seem like they want anything to do with it. But the matter of fact is that Yes, It is a very valid reason to be jealous.

You did miss out on having a full time mom and it is okay to feel jealous.", "NTA \nSadly , assuming your mother finally got her sh*t together, the bond she will develop with her new born during those first few years could be light years from what you had with her.

I have a hunch , with the quality of your post that there is a bright future for you. Whether emotionally or broader. Good luck.", "NTA. Something is wrong with H and your grandparents to say you are selfish when you are experiencing feelings of abandonment because your mom decided to treat you like rubbish", "You've had a difficult family situation. \n\nI would be hard pressed to judge you as TA for crying, just because you're a teenager.

H also has no right to be calling you a brat over this. I do think it would be a good idea to seek out a therapist to start working on your abandonment problems, because this could start to reflect in other aspects of your life, not just your relationship with your mom. I wish you the best, OP, and hope that people come around to understand why you're hurting so much.", "NTA, im kind of in the same boat except many years after it happened. i didnt feel replaced until i was almost an adult and my half siblings were around 5-10. felt worse because im adopted so it felt like he was choosing his biological children over a child he chose to adopt which is ironic because my dad was also adopted. sad to say she isnt going to change unless she wants to. i see my dad once a year if im lucky and hes stopped inviting me to christmas. everyone tells me to forget about him because i have people who love me but we all know its not that easy.\n\nim so sorry youre going through this, its one of the worst feelings in the world feeling like one of your parents has stopped caring. definitely look into therapy if you and your dad can afford it, and do whatever you need to do to look after yourself first and foremost.", "NTA. You're upset and you have a right to be. It's wild that they would expect you to control your emotions on that level. It doesn't sound like you did anything rude.

I am so sorry you have had this experience.", "MTA your mom basically gave up on you. It was a wrong selfish thing to do.

Maybe write a letter or email when you are calm telling her how her not including you and not inviting you over feels. How did she react when you said you were being replaced.

Your feelings are more than valid. I mean shit she didn't even invite you over to actually spend time, she invited you over to tell you there was going to be yet another reason why she doesn't have time for you.\n\nAre you jealous? Yes. You're allowed to be jealous that your mother cares more about her current husband and their kids together than you. That's completely normal. And its a situation your mother created. This is entirely her doing and on her to fix. Will she? I don't know OP but I will say that you don't have to wait for her to pull her head out of her ass and realize how she has wronged and harmed you.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

I am really sorry you are going through this. Just remember its not the baby's fault, your mom made her decisions.", "NTA. I know exactly how you feel. When I was 14 my mom and stepdad announced on Christmas that they were having a baby. I was upset because I felt that instead of taking care of the children that were already here, they just wanted to create a new one. But I will say this, me being open to my mom about how I felt really helped strengthen our relationship. Now that little brother is 23 years old, and I\u2019m extremely close with him. I truly hope that you can have a great relationship with your mom and your younger siblings. Good luck.", "A therapist will help them understand why you feel this way.  Suggest you all go", "NTA.
