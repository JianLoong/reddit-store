Now you feel insecure and are questioning yourself whether you're overreacting or not. \n\nWhether it's normal or not that a divorced guy invites his ex to his birthday sleepover because she's the mother of his kids, but doesn't invite his (serious) girlfriend to his birthday celebration. Ps: it's not normal, you are not overreacting. \n\nAre you \ud83d\udc4d with being second place when it comes to his ex? It's the mother of his kids but does that mean that irregardless of anything she will be the invited plus 1 he invites when it's a family celebration?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like bf has not told his parents that he broke up with his ex or that they are working on things.\n\nHaving both you and his ex there could be very awkward. It is weird that he invited his ex and not you. I would expect a bloody good reason but it seems he didn't have one.", "NTA this is weird, normally one would take your own kids and your current partner. I probably would not stand for that treatment", "NTA.\nDump him.", "NTA I think it is strange he would invite his ex regardless if they have kids. I'd not like that and would feel a bit insecure. Maybe try and have a conversation with him about it. Their relationship could be completely friendly but your feelings are very valid and you should be able to communicate with him openly.", "He unfortunately does not seem to care about your feeling maybe this relationship is not going anywhere sorry to say", "NTA.\n\nIt may be that he's just meaning to put the kids' comfort first, rather than his ex making the cut with *him* ahead of you. But you've been together nearly a year, and he should be thinking of you too. Most people would be upset in your position.", "NTA at all\n\nI can understand him not taking you on the trip. Not saying it's right or wrong, it completely depends on a lot of variables that don't matter now.\n\nBut it makes zero sense for him to take his ex just because she's the mother of the kids. I actually think it's bad for the kids when ex-couples act like that. You divorced, act like it. There's no \"spend Xmas together\" or \"spend vacations together\" or anything of the sort. That's just confusing for the kids and gives them false hopes that their parents will get back together.\n\nAnd that will have a negative impact in their relationship with you as they'll potentially see you as the person preventing their parents from being together.\n\nYour feelings are completely valid.", "NTA - if you hadn\u2019t already met his kids I would have suspected he lied to you and was actually still married and living a double life!", "Tell him while he is out with his wife and kids youll be going out to dinner with your X.", "NTA and for me this would be a dealbreaker not even worth spending more on than \"we're done, have fun with your ex\".", "NTA. And also very questionable behaviour from your bf. Like I would get celebrating with his family and kids, but why does the Ex have to be there? Honestly I would get it if he's hesitant because of his kids, because a new woman at the dad's side could be confusing and bringing a new partner in for the relationship not to work out is risky, but if you already met them I don't see the problem. Especially after a year of relationship. And he's not even bringing forward any reasons like??? Weird.", "In what capacity did the kids meet you? Did he introduce you as the girlfriend? How old are the children? These are very important questions because this tells me if he is still in a relationship with his ex or not.", "You haven't been together a whole year yet, so it's reasonable that he might not include you in all family events at this point, but a conversation is definitely in order.  Just to set your own expectations and get a read on how he sees your relationship, Ask him at what point he think he will consider you family enough to be included in family functions.  Ask when you are calm enough to handle the situation gently, regardless. His answer will tell you a lot.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Communication.   It appears you are at a 7 of ten in the relationship, and he is treating you as if he's in a 3 of ten.  You and he need to talk, and if I were you, I would re-evaluate your situation.   Either he ups his game, or you demote him in your life.

Giving them false hope that their parents will get back together by continuing to do things like that is foolish."]}
