It was a beautiful day and we are so excited she\u2019s gotten everything she\u2019s wanted but, we feel a little snubbed\u2026\n\nShe barely talked to us the entire night, and really didn\u2019t acknowledge us at all honestly. If you\u2019re asking why were such close friends and not in the wedding (we were surprised too). Her bridesmaids were entirely people from his family, because he didn\u2019t want anyone in the ceremony that wasn\u2019t catholic. \n\nIt\u2019s not like we were expecting her to spend the night with us, but we wanted to be at least acknowledged or to celebrate with her in some way? We all left feeling like we were just invited to fill seats in a room. For example, she would smile in passing or say hi/accept a hug but she wouldn\u2019t engage in anything with us like a dance or conversation. \n\nNow, it\u2019s my year to host Friendsgiving and we\u2019re doing it at my family\u2019s cottage in Maine.

Honestly, if you hadn't specifically mentioned a wedding and vacations taken together, I would have thought y'all were about 13 based on the tone and complaints here. \n\nThis was your dear friend's wedding day - one of the only days in her life that is meant entirely to celebrate her and the man she loves - and you're making it about you and a bunch of other people. You're literally complaining that she didn't spend enough time on HER special day fussing over you and your \"friend group\". Why would she? It's literally supposed to be the other way around. You were all supposed to be there to celebrate HER. It was not her job to make you feel loved or special on her wedding day. And as others have noted, most brides barely get a moment to even think clearly, much less contemplate whether they've made each and every guest feel particularly doted on. My sister didn't even get to eat on her wedding day, despite gorgeous catering, a full meal and hor d'oeuvres, she was so busy running around. \n\nYTA and you should be ashamed of yourself. You not only spent her wedding day thinking about yourselves, now you're trying to punish her for it. You sound like dreadful \"friends\" who don't know the meaning of the word.", "YTA\n\nif you guys are truly lifelong friends like this, why in the world would you jump immediately to talking behind her back and excluding her _the next day_ after this happened? \n\nat least speak to her first and find out what was going on behind the scenes during her wedding - none of you were in the bridal party so you have no idea what it might have been like for her, it sounds like her husband and his family put a lot of pressure on. \n\ni\u2019m not saying it was right that she treated you guys that way but you should think about whether or not this was a pattern from her culminating in this wedding experience or if this was something out of character for the person you\u2019ve known your whole lives.", "YTA. \n\nWeddings are very busy. The bride and groom barely have time to eat let alone spend a large amount of time with one group. I remember my wedding and I definitely felt like the day and night went so fast and barely got to talk to anyone even though I barely ate or drank or sat down. \n\nIs there additional backstory that would make you boot a friend you\u2019ve had for ages over her being busy at *her* *wedding*? \n\nI feel like I\u2019m missing the crux of the issue here.", "INFO: Has anyone in the group had an adult conversation about this that included her? \n\nThat said, my brain melted a little here: \"she very well could have been tailoring her time to people she thought would need that extra attention.\"\n\nWhy does she need to give y'all \"extra attention\" on HER wedding day?", "YTA for immediately creating a group text without her and spending the morning shitting on her. \n\n\nQuestion: did you guys try to engage her? Or were you just waiting for her to come to you? \n\nWeddings are terribly busy and stressful, as others have mentioned, and you're often pulled in a million different directions. It can be really hard to divide your time up and enjoy yourself at the same time. \n\nIf you guys don't at least try to have an adult conversation with her about how you all felt and immediately jump to uninviting her from stuff, that's really shitty of all of you and makes me question the depth of your friendship.", "Info: have any of you actually spoken to her and asked straight out what was up that night? Have you even given her a chance to explain?", "YTA, based on what you\u2019ve written. \n\nWeddings are busy and stressful. Sorry if you felt snubbed that she didn\u2019t give you a shoutout or a friend\u2019s dance. It also sounds like her husband is toxic so she may have had even more stress and time constraints. \n\nYou haven\u2019t said her behavior is part of a larger pattern.", "YTA for not inviting her\u2026this year. \n\nNext year? You will probably have more evidence as to whether she has changed, was this wedding day behavior a one-time thing, and do you want to continue the friendship.", "YTA\n\nDo you have any idea how busy the bride is on her wedding day?  When I got married my wife and I didn\u2019t have a minute to sit down.  We had to talk to so many people, thank everyone for coming, socialize constantly even though we\u2019re both pretty introverted normally, barely got two minutes to eat, etc.  My close friends were there as well and outside of some pre-ceremony time with my groomsmen I didn\u2019t really get a chance to talk at length with anyone either. \n\nFrom what you\u2019ve written, it sounds like you all need to chill out and stop being so selfish.  That was HER day and you were there to support and celebrate her. So why make it all about you?", "YTA\n\nShe acknowledged you and them by saying hello. I've been in enough weddings to know how stressful the bride can get on Her Day. A bride is pulled in many directions and has obligations or at least feels like they do to greet friends & family, some of which they've never met. \n\nThis sounds like a large wedding. I've had bride friends that accepted and out of respect chose family members as bridesmaids due to it being a custom in the grooms/brides family. \n\nVery large bridal parties 10-12+ bridesmaids with 250-500 guests is a lot of work and time is limited for a bride. When you have 50 first cousins it happens. These large weddings I've attended have mostly been friends with Italian or Greek heritage. \n\nI'd give her a break. You made the guest list.", "Have any of you been married before? Yall seem childish. Are you even friends if you're going to ice her out that fast? This is high school drama, grow up. Yta.", "YTA and being self-centered. She smiled and said hello. Why do you think you should get more attention than that from the bride at her wedding?? You had friends to hang out with, entertainment and food to enjoy. A bride and groom often spend most of their time (understandably) connecting with elderly relatives and extended family, family friends, and others they may never see except for at weddings and funerals. Plus they may be meeting some of these people for the first time and want to have meaningful conversations with each of them.\n\nInvite her to the gatherings, add her to the group chats, and tell her what a wonderful time you had with your friends celebrating her wedding.", "You and your friends all sound like unsympathetic a******.", "YTA. You and your \u201cposse\u201d need to grow up past middle school mentality. By the sound of it, it was a large wedding - how much time do you think she had per guest? Plus, there may be people she wanted to get to know, people she hadn\u2019t seen in a long time and wanted to catch up with, etc - you know, normal stuff in a large wedding. It\u2019s obvious you and your friends are salty that you weren\u2019t bridesmaids or somehow guests of honor and didn\u2019t get a speech that you\u2019re just so, so important. Get over yourselves.", "Gentle YTA, weddings are really busy.. only the most powerful bride can personally greet everyone at large wedding. As friends you gotta understand and just enjoy her joy, feel so happy for her on her special day.", "YTA.  She had a lot of people to attend to at the wedding.  She wasn't trying to snub you.", "YTA. It was her wedding and you and your friends are just making it about yourselves. They gave a reason for the all Catholic bridesmaids and you don't want to respect their religious choice. All I read was me, me, me.", "YTA, actually a huge asshole. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if you are married or not, but at my wedding I didn\u2019t have time to really chat with anyone, barely had time to chill with my own spouse. \n\nYou all are acting like children, and you are forgetting something. The wedding is about your friend, not anything else. However, you are making this about you and the cronies. This isn\u2019t a vacation, this isn\u2019t a game night.. this is her wedding. \n\nWhat you \u201cwanted\u201d isn\u2019t important.

You should be ashamed\u2026 If you aren\u2019t, it\u2019s truly about you.", "YTA\n\n\"My friend group from elementary school\" are you sure you aren't all still in elementary? Entire thought process here is so childish and selfish", "YTA. \n\nSo at 95% of the weddings I have gone to, I have gotten nothing from the couple during the evening except a few smiles and maybe a group table photo. I have a photo from one wedding where the only time I interacted with the bride was when I came up behind her because her hair piece was falling out. Literally my only interaction, we have continued ot be friends for 20 years. \n\nYou have no idea how stressed out she was, anxious, maybe didn't feel well, or she had a wonderful night but was pulled in 1,000 directions. What kind of terrible friends are like- she didn't give us enough attention at HER wedding, so literally the next day we will uninvite her from stuff. \n\nYou could have joined her on the dance floor, you could have gone up to her 1,000 times in the night, or you could have accepted that weddings are major events and people get lost in planning and family obligations and often don't eat or even remember much of their own party. \n\nBut no, you all sat at the table fuming you weren't the highlight of her night. \n\nHow about you all take it down a notch and stop being mean girls.

Yes, weddings are incredibly busy and can be stressful for the bride, so I understand that she didn't spend time with you all.  But my guess is that she's distancing herself from you all to accommodate her new husband so I don't think she'll attend your Friendsgiving anyway or stay close to your friend group.  Talk with her one on one but be prepared that she doesn't want to be as close anymore.  NAH", "1. Your wedding is NOT your most important or most beautiful day of your life. 2. Maybe talk to her before you go to drastic measures as removing someone from a friend group entirely without them understanding/knowing? ESH", "A one time pass for distant behavior on her wedding day is to be expected.  Invite her and see if she accepts and is emotionally present if she comes.  The ball is in her court but be prepared to move on.\n\nNAH", "NTA If it's a consensus, then don't invite her. Or tell her she needs to repair relationships if she wants an invite.", "So far NTA but if you continue down this road without speaking to your friend then YTA. Your friendship group are making assumptions, there could be reasons behind how she acted. I would hate to be in a group where one mistake gets me kicked out after years of friendship.", "Yes this read very immature. Middle school vibes. Especially how quickly they move to ice their \u201cfriend\u201d out. Bizarre.", "I think they\u2019re doing a lot of comparing to another friend in the groups earlier summer wedding, where we just all felt more involved and apart of the important day. We were in that wedding, so it was easier to feel apart of it. That is a point I have brought up to them. \n\nI just overall don\u2019t want to create issues with anyone. I can\u2019t understand both sides, to some degree. I don\u2019t agree with the new group chat. \n\nAlso for context, Friendsgiving is always end of October/Early November timeframe and spouses/family are welcome but not required because we understand they shouldn\u2019t be forced to be our friends.", "Right? This sounds shockingly childish to me. If they hadn't specifically mentioned a wedding and going on vacations together, reading the general tone of this I honestly would have thought OP was about 13. \"Why is she IGNORING us?! Why didn't she pay attention to us?!\" \n\nIt was her wedding day and OP literally made it about their \"friend group\". Their whole attitude is so staggeringly selfish . . . everyone's attention should have been on the bride and groom, not on how much fuss the celebrated couple were making about their friends.", "She\u2019s on her honeymoon, and that\u2019s definitely not something I would talk about over text.", "I would hope they haven't talked to her about it yet since the wedding was just last night! I do think they should talk to her, but let her enjoy being a newlywed for a little bit first.", "This!!", "I was gonna say. I had literally the smallest wedding ever and I still got overwhelmed. A full sized wedding is a nightmare", "I don\u2019t see anything the bride did that was wrong, given that it was her wedding day? \n\nIt\u2019s rare to have time to speak much with friends at your wedding, especially if it\u2019s a big wedding. I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid in weddings where once the ceremony started I didn\u2019t get the chance to speak to the bride again until the next day. There are so many family members and family friends to greet who you may not see again for a long time. I felt blessed to be part of their day, and enjoyed meeting other people at the wedding that I had never met before. It\u2019s fun a few days after the wedding to share stories about the sweet cousin, the groom\u2019s funny friend, or the crazy uncle\u2019s dance moves.", "I just feel everyone (as a whole) is being really immature. Unless this particular friend has a habit of leaving you all high and dry, \u201cshe didn\u2019t make me feel important on HER wedding day\u201d makes me irate and I don\u2019t even have a horse in the race. It\u2019s not about you all. It was about her, her husband, and their joining of families. \n\nI mean maybe she does suck but this post only tells me how her friends are jerks.", "not to mention the immediately creating a group chat without her, it's like they're in high school", "But you'll talk shit *about* her with your other friends over text?", "My wedding was a large one as my family is huge but I still had time to talk to friends. OP made it sound like this group of friends are really close and it seems out of the ordinary for her to not speak or make time for them. It\u2019s the couples day and they can speak to who they want but it can also make people feel put out. I\u2019m just saying that not inviting someone to something they do every year seems a bit much without speaking to her first", "Or fourth grade."]}
