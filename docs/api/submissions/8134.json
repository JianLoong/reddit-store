If yes, some % of paycheck after 18 is reasonable, but not 50%.\n\nGet yourself your own account, close or remove your name on any she has, especially credit cards, do a credit check to nake sure she doesn't have any loans or credit cards in your name. She may be stealing from you in many ways.\n\nMaybe ask dad for help (for you).", "Info : you believe your mom when she says you're lazy even though she litteraly doesn't work ? Like I get she has depression but for what ? She cheated dude", "NTA. Your mom is using you and gaslighting you when she got caught. Find another place to live and focus on yourself.", "NTA. She stole money from you. You had no obligation to drop out and pay for everything. She neglected you. I suggest you tell her you are moving out and follow through on it. \n\nI would even consider reporting her to the police to accessing your bank account without your permission. I also suggest you get a credit check to make sure she hasn't gotten any credit cards out in your name.", "please open a new account without your mom on it. Is your dad involved? You should be helped not helping someone who doesn\u2019t care enough about herself or you", "She quit her job and made you leave school, and she calls you lazy?  And then steals your money?  NTA\n\nGood news, at 18 you can drain that account and open another one she has no access to at a different bank.  And tell her she can speak to the cops if she tries taking any more.", "INFO: Where was your dad while all this was happening?", "NTA\n\nAs someone whose mother also stole from them at a vulnerable age, don't let her lies get to you.  It's not selfish and entitled to want to have a discussion about where the money you're earning is going.  She is your mother; she's supposed to provide for you as a child, not the other way around.  I suggest the following:\n\n\\- Save up under another account at a different bank that isn't connected to your mother and move your direct deposit there\n\n\\- Find important documents like your birth certificate and SS card, and either hide them in a safe place (I cut a corner of carpet in my room to hide things in, inside the lining of a bed box spring works too) or put them at a trusted friend's house (ONLY if they've completely trustworthy and their family isn't friends with your mother)\n\n\\- If you have a car that you pay for, keep your keys close by as much as you can.  If the title isn't under your name, look for some other means of transportation  in case she takes the car back\n\n\\- Keep a small bag of clothes and toiletries in a hidden place that you can reach.  Having a bag packed and ready to go very well could have saved my life\n\n\\- You can agree to paying her rent if you find it managable, but make sure that its a reasonable amount and that you have leftovers for savings.  It might be cheaper to live with a few roommates or a friend than to dump your money into trying to save her\n\nI don't know if it's exactly the same situation as I was in, but it's pretty clear from your words that your mom isn't mentally stable right now.  Please take care of yourself.  If you feel guilty, remember that you can't save someone from drowning if you're drowning yourself.", "NTA!  You are neither lazy nor selfish, and she does not deserve half your salary.  Your mom needs to get herself together and you need to get your own bank account set up so she can't take your money", "you need to secure your bank account from your mother.\n\nNTA", "NTA please open a new bank account that your mom doesn\u2019t have access to and find a safe place to live", "NTA\n\nNot by miles, friendo.\n\nYou not only took on, at a very early age (I feel you on that one btw), the responsibilities of being an adult by working and keeping your family afloat.\n\nYou've done nothing wrong, are not being anything but selfless (you dropped out of school for goodness sakes!) in your actions.\n\nIf your Mother is anything like mine was, she's transferring onto you the frustration, shame and anger she has for being so helpless and useless as a parent, but lashing out at you rather than processing it healthily.\n\nIf I were you, I would be making sure you go setup your own bank account, which she has no access to and have your pay go into this instead - your work will no doubt make this easy for you. This way she has no control over it.\n\nYou've already done enough and have no need to feel guilty - she's not entitled to your money at all and you're already doing all you can to ensure you both have as good lives as you can manage.\n\nIf your mother is already getting Therapy still, I would mention this to the Therapist perhaps as I doubt your Mother will - they may help talk some sense into her. \n\nFailing that you can do your best to highlight to your mother that this is your money, which you earned by working. You've sacrificed your education and taken on work at a young age to support her when she needed it - it's not selfish for you to keep the money you earn when you _already_ are looking after her, her mental health etc.", "NTA\n\nShe fucked around and found out the consequences.\n\nMy mom did something similar with my money when I lived with her. \n\nYour mom is going to leech of you as long as you let her.

Imagine being called selfish by a cheater SMFH! I also suggest you get a new account that your mom won't have access too.

Get a new bank account asap and move out. She\u2019s not entitled to your money period.", "How does your mom have access to YOUR bank account? Seriously sometimes I read things that make no sense to me. Where I live, only the owner of a bank account can touch it.", "Immediately NTA, she's abusing your finances, stealing your money, and using her mental health as an excuse. RUN OP GET A NEW BANK ACCOUNT AND RUN TO YOUR DAD GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND NEVER LOOK BACK!", "Deny her access to your account asap. And do not give her anything. She is not entitled to it. In fact, she OWES you big time for failing to do the most basic parental requirement of supporting her child. You are NTA. \n\nIf you're using a joint account, take all your money and open a new personal one. If she's simply accessing your personal account, inform the bank to take her access off. You are now an adult. Get a new debit card if necessary and cancel the old ones. I know you're still 18 but consider saving up to get away from your mother. Also, would you be able to go to school? Maybe get the equivalent of a GED in your country?", "NTA: She is you mother. You are not responsible for her. Get a different bank account that she doesn't have access to ASAP and close your current one.", "NTA. I think your mother is the one behaving selfishly here, not you. Close the bank account and open another one at a different bank. Do whatever it takes to keep your money far away from her. In my opinion, just because you've supported her in the past doesn't mean she is entitled to take your money for herself as she pleases. This is your income, not hers. I believe you should be in charge of how it is used, not her.", "Time to change the pin number to your bank account. Family are always the first ones to steal from you.", "I wouldn't be surprised if the mother wasn't as depressed as OP said and was just being lazy.", "To add to this, OP needs to check his credit to make sure no credit cards have been taken out in his name.", "OP is also within their rights to make a police report. OP should also get a credit report done to make sure mother isn't opening any credit in OP's name given she has already been caught stealing.", "Get out of there as fast as you can. Not only for yourself, but also for your mother.", "The pin might not be enough. Mom may have access through her bank account. OP should open a new account at a different bank.", "This.  NTA.

I was responding to the previous poster who strongly believes that the dad (in his mind) is ok to leave them alone and let the kid reach out.\n\nThat being said, there is a part on the dad where he can be faulted. He is letting his daughter leave high school to take care of the household. I don\u2019t know if I could let my kid do that. That being said, I wouldn\u2019t be the mom in the story either!"]}
