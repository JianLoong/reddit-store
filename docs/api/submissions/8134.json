It seems her character hasn't changed.\n\nAlthough I am curious, where is your dad while you have gone through all of this?", "NTA- get a new bank account, deny any demands from your mother for money and tell her it\u2019s time she acts like an adult and face up to her life and responsibilities", "NTA\n\nshe's stealing your money.

Sorry for your situation.", "You have been financially supporting your cheating mother for a year, having to drop out of school,  and she calls you selfish, entitled and lazy?\n\nTime to kick your mum off your bank account and go live with Dad.

Why aren\u2019t you with your dad?\n\nShe has already shown you how selfish she is... why are you surprised that she stole from you and blame you for it too?", "NTA. A person like her deserves nothing from no one and you should cut her off and move out. Why did/do you live with her instead of your father in the first place?", "NTA \n\nGet a new bank account without her name on it.", "A majorly big NTA\n\nShe have stolen your hard earned money that you have used to keep yourself and your mother a float along with helping her get therapy for her depression and this is her answer to your kindness by stealing your money behind your back and gaslighting you for being \u201dselfish\u201d!!\n\nNo my young friend, you have already done enough for her and now it\u2019s time to leave home and find your own place. \nYou have gone up and beyond to help her and in no way are you \u201dduty bound\u201d to be her \u201dmoney bag\u201d, run and never look back on your witch of a mother!!", "NTA. Change bank accounts and make an exit plan", "Pffffft NTA 100%. She's stealing from you, gaslighting you (assumed, wasn't in post) enough that you have to ASK REDDIT if it's okay to not let your mom continue to steal from you, and then has the AUDACITY to call you lazy. There are 2 things I don't deal well with: disrespect and others putting their jobs and responsibilities on me. You are the child. You. Not her. And yet she has put you in an adult role taking care of her and the household. You paid for her therapy. That was amazing of you. I applaud you for that. There are many parents who wouldn't even go that far. Report the theft, go nc, and get some therapy for yourself if you haven't already.", "NTA. Make sure you close this bank account and open another one that she cannot access. This is abnormal behaviour. No grown woman should rely on the minimum-wage job of her teenager and then have the audacity to call said teenager lazy and entitled.\n\nGet out of there as fast as you can. Not only for yourself, but also for your mother. Necessity may force her to get her life back on track, but the older she gets, the more difficult it will be for her.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that you had such a tough time supporting her in the past. If you live with her, you should be contributing financially BUT she has absolutely no right to take a cent of your money without your agreement. Probably best to agree what the arrangement is upfront. When I lived at home, I gave up a third of my money which felt fair- but you need to  agree the amount depending on your circumstances. MOST NB: you need a separate bank account so you\u2019re in control of your own money!", "NTA.\n\nMan, I would have given my mother my entire salary if she asked me nicely, which she does nowadays lol.

Nah.", "NTA, your mother is supposed to look after you, not the other way round", "NTA and I highly suggest you get your own account and stuff because that's a red flag, you are at this point her \"meal ticket\"", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She fucked up her life by choosing to cheat and throw her marriage away, which sent her into a downward spiral that you dragged her out of and supported her and sacrificed graduating high school for her, and she now robs you blind and calls you entitled?

Good luck! Later!", "We also don't know what the divorce settlement was, if he pulled back his parental rights (or whatever it's called), if they even have ways to contact or many many other stuff. \n\nBut yes he should have a problem with it.. But I also understand that for him it would've been a \"that's on you\" type thing with the depression, since it was the moms fault after all", "While I have sympathy for the daughter, I have none for the mom. Poor her, she fucked her boss and got caught and is now depressed, boo hoo. I'm really not sure why the daughter didn't go to live with the dad. I suppose at 17 you sort of get that choice, and for some reason she chose her mom. Not sure what the story is on the dad or where he lives now though, so who knows, maybe living with the mom was a better option somehow."]}
