She's stealing from you, gaslighting you (assumed, wasn't in post) enough that you have to ASK REDDIT if it's okay to not let your mom continue to steal from you, and then has the AUDACITY to call you lazy. There are 2 things I don't deal well with: disrespect and others putting their jobs and responsibilities on me. You are the child. You. Not her. And yet she has put you in an adult role taking care of her and the household. You paid for her therapy. That was amazing of you. I applaud you for that. There are many parents who wouldn't even go that far. Report the theft, go nc, and get some therapy for yourself if you haven't already.", "NTA. Make sure you close this bank account and open another one that she cannot access. This is abnormal behaviour. No grown woman should rely on the minimum-wage job of her teenager and then have the audacity to call said teenager lazy and entitled.\n\nGet out of there as fast as you can.

I\u2019m sorry that you had such a tough time supporting her in the past. If you live with her, you should be contributing financially BUT she has absolutely no right to take a cent of your money without your agreement. Probably best to agree what the arrangement is upfront. When I lived at home, I gave up a third of my money which felt fair- but you need to  agree the amount depending on your circumstances.

You have taken care of your mother for a whole year. You had to drop out of school to support your mum and this is what she does to you. Unforgivable.

You could have stayed with your father but you stayed with you mom and took care of her.", "NTA. It's obvious. Your mom took your money without your knowing. So she knows that she is wrong. Ohterwise she would have asked for the money in front of you, not taking your money behind your back.", "Wow wtf?? She called YOU selfish, entitled, and lazy?? She fucked up her life by choosing to cheat and throw her marriage away, which sent her into a downward spiral that you dragged her out of and supported her and sacrificed graduating high school for her, and she now robs you blind and calls you entitled? I'd find a way to move out and tell her she made her bed and she can sleep in it now. I wouldn't give her another dime.\n\nETA - NTA.", "NTA. Time to move out and get a bank account that is solely yours.", "Nta, if you make enough money to support you both you make enough money to support just you.

Good luck! Later!", "We also don't know what the divorce settlement was, if he pulled back his parental rights (or whatever it's called), if they even have ways to contact or many many other stuff. \n\nBut yes he should have a problem with it.. But I also understand that for him it would've been a \"that's on you\" type thing with the depression, since it was the moms fault after all", "While I have sympathy for the daughter, I have none for the mom. Poor her, she fucked her boss and got caught and is now depressed, boo hoo. I'm really not sure why the daughter didn't go to live with the dad. I suppose at 17 you sort of get that choice, and for some reason she chose her mom. Not sure what the story is on the dad or where he lives now though, so who knows, maybe living with the mom was a better option somehow.", "NTA and its time to get a separate bank account.

If not open a new bank account only in your name, go live with your father, and finish school!!", "NTA \nGo back and finish school, get a GED or equivalent. Dont give her any money, of you want to help just pay for part of groceries and bills. Get her out of your bank account or make a new one she doesn't have access to. \n\nSave up for moving out. I have no sympathy for her, her actions ruined her life, you still stuck around and help her and she has the gall to call you selfish when you dropped out at 17 and paid for her needs?", "NTA. She stole from you. It's time to close that account and open a new one in your name only. Stick to online records only and don't share any details with her (not even the name of the bank). Also, start regularly monitoring your credit as parents that financially abuse and steal from their children also have a habit of opening lines of credit in their child's name.  \n\nYou were far more generous than 99 percent of kids would be in your situation. You basically became the adult of the household at 17 and had to abandon your education because she decided she no longer had to be a functioning parent and adult. She's presumably working again, but still needs to steal your money. If she had been short on this month's bills, she should have discussed that with you (and given your prior generosity, that would've been the route and reasonable person would go). That she went and took it without saying a word tells me the issue is what she's spending the money on (that she doesn't want you to find out). \n\nStart looking for alternative living situations ASAP.", "Woah woah woah, sorry, so you helped her out, dropped out of school, got her therapy for her depression after SHE CHEATED, and now she's calling you selfish cause she's taking from you.OP, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind, and I think, if you can, move out and your Mom learn to stand on her own two feet again and get her life together after the consequences of her actions. NTA and however she is accessing your account, put a stop to that", "NTA get a new account that she has no access to and protect your money and yourself from her. You've already done way more than a child should have to for their parent.", "NTA you mom is stealing from you.", "NTA You gave up your education for your Mum. That is life changing. Move out, save up, have another crack at it. You deserve better than to be working in fast food at age 40 before going home to be Mum\u2019s carer.", "NTA, remove her from your account immidiately and start looking for solutions to move out.", "Honey, you are your mothers child not her SO.   You should never had to support her at 12. That is abuse. So stop her access to your account, get therapy and move out.. go live your life. Your allowed. She lived hers and she is Not your responsibility", "NTA\n\nYou stayed with your mom, who caused the divorce. You helped her get back on her feet, even after having to give up your education for it. You even got her therapy, which is impressive by itself for someone as young as you to be able to convince her.\n\nShe's paying you back by stealing half your paychecks? Sure feels like she knows what she sees you as.\n\nMove out and cut her off. She's using you.", "NTA by a long shot. Not sure if this is an acceptable dynamic for your culture? Religion? But I\u2019d be telling my mom to GFH, how\u2019s that for being selfish", "NTA. Based on your title  I was prepared to say, yeah, give your moms some money if you\u2019re living together for rent, but she\u2019s *stealing* from you. She is 100% the asshole. Make a new account, move your money into a different bank, and don\u2019t give her access. You haven\u2019t been lazy, you\u2019ve been hoeing that whole row for yourself and her for months.\n\nI\u2019d next be thinking about making sure she hasn\u2019t opened lines of credit under your name and is in the process of totally destroying your financial identity. I\u2019d also think about looking into local community resources to get you the hell out of that house and into your own little place, finishing your GED and not letting her drown you into poverty before you have a chance to maybe make it out.", "NTA, get yourself a new bank account with another bank. In your name only.\n\nAnd make plans to move out. Your mom is toxic.", "Oop\u2014 at 18, I\u2019m pretty sure you can open a new bank account and then deposit your checks there. Your current account your mom will always have some access to. My friend just closed the account her mom could see because her mom would ask her for money sometimes. After 14 years, I still have an account that my dad can see, but I never deposit there. He also doesn\u2019t touch my money, but he\u2019s gifted me spare money maybe two or three times in the last 6 years.", "NTA She's selfish and entitled. Don't let her ruin your life.", "nta you helped your mum despite the fact she cheated you dropped put of college and gave up education to help her. Thats more than anuth.", "NTA. Your mother is eating your life. Her behavior forced you to drop out of school, massively damaging your longterm chances in life, and now she\u2019s stealing your salary. Leave her in her own mess.  Protect your documents, credit and identity - someone like this may already have stolen it to ruin your credit.\n\nCan you move in with your dad? You are still young enough to enroll in high school and graduate, or continue working and get your GED. If you can\u2019t, find roommates and get that GED.", "Your mom is a bad person. She cheated on her husband, then could not cope with the consequences, so she kindof forced her only child to stop studying and support her financially. I mean, come on, you probably love her, but that is one of the scummiest thing a parent can do to her child and then she goes even lower?\n\nNTA and you should consider getting out of there as fast as possible imo.", "Also important to get the new account AT A DIFFERENT BANK.\n\nIf it's the same bank then the accounts may be linked and Mom could find a way in.", "This poor kid had to drop out of school and jeopardize her future and her mom is stealing money from her.\n\nShe needs to run, anyone who makes their kid drop out of school to support them is a leech who will suck away a kid's future.", "Before the mother ever expects any rent, she owes OP money to pay for everything to finish school.", "Tbh I would do the same thing if my wife cheated on me with her boss and if my kid chose her as well.. \n\nAlthough, I'd probably never be in that situation, I'm a gay infertile man so..", "We don't know anything about the dad. For all we know he wanted a new start somewhere far away. You can't expect a teenager to uproot themselves for their last year in school because you don't want to live near your ex. Or maybe OP felt like she just couldn't leave her spiraling mom alone. Being a shit partner doesn't mean you are a shit parent or that your kid suddenly stops loving you. \n\nNo matter what, the dad should have stepped in for the kid and made sure she did not drop out of school. In the end OP had two shitty parents who let her down.", "She\u2019s 17.  There\u2019s a certain amount of autonomy that a 17 year old should have but choosing mom in the divorce wouldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t have translated to allowing your child to live with an incapacitated mother.  Even CPS wouldn\u2019t have let her stay there.", "We really don\u2019t know how this all went down or what the dad\u2019s situation is, but I\u2019m still judging him hard for not making sure his minor child is graduating from high school and removing her from a household with a fully incapacitated parent.  It\u2019s not the kid\u2019s job to take care of her mother."]}
