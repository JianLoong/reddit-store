You must decide if independence is worth the initial change of lifestyle.", "Children aren\u2019t responsible for supporting their parents. She caused the divorce by cheating, you took a huge burden on yourself for that year and she needs to take care of herself. Get a new bank account and never share that info with her. Put a lock on your credit. She is being a thief. NTA", "NTA. Honestly eliminate her access to your account, leave and let her learn the hard way. Should have been grateful to have your support. Go live your best life.", "NTA and remove permissions from your mom. This is financial and emotional AND verbal abuse", "NTA.  You need to remove your mom from your bank account.  She was stealing your money, and taking the money behind your back.", "So your mom got depressed because she reaped the consequences of her own actions which led to you ruining your future to pay the bills she's legally responsible for. Now you're legally an adult and she's quite literally illegally stealing from you. No you're nta. And please for the love of everything open a new bank account she has no access to and gtf out of there as soon as you can. This is an incredibly unhealthy relationship and you deserve way better", "NTA Stop your mom from having access for your money. Why is mom not working? Have you thought of moving out & starting school? You need to make plans for your future & mom needs to stand on her own. Where is dad?", "NTA. Why don\u2019t you live with your dad?", "Oh, sweetie. Do yourself a favor and run.", "NTA, you need to get your bank account under your - and only your control - take her off it \n\nget back to school - and get out of the situation - mom caused her issues - she can suck it up and get a job again - you have been working and supporting her - she is the lazy one", "NTA. Even pimps don't take that much. Get a new bank account and direct your paycheck there. Also consider moving. You are being financially abused by your mom.\n\nI hope you are able to go back to school. I'm sorry you've had to deal with this alone.", "NTA.\n\nThe last thing you need to do is buy her a shovel so she can dig herself out of the hole she got herself into.\n\nIn all seriousness, take the funds out of the account and open a new account at a different institution, or just a new one in general and have them notate on the account your mother is not permitted to transact at all.", "NTA it's time to run. Cut the apron strings you're not her mother she's yours and she's behaving abominably. You screwed up your education to support her and this is how she repays you talk to your dad.", "Your mom stole from you. That's a call to the cops.", "NTA, you have done more than required, at this point your mom has been stealing from you.  Tell mom that you expect all of the money to be repaid, and by when, and if they don't you will go to the police and press theft charges.   \n    \nThen, change your bank, open an account your mom does not have access to and protect yourself.  But get all of that money back.", "NTA. Cut your mom off, and see if you can maybe get a GED and some more education, so you can get a better job. You\u2019ve already derailed your life enough for your mom.", "NTA - you switch banks and get away from your mom!", "NTA. Your mom has some nerve smh", "NTA\n\nWhere is your dad? Can you live with him? What she's doing is stealing, and it's illegal to make your under 18 kid drop out of school to work.", "Clear NTA. You supported her financially through her self-inflicted depression and *you're* the selfish, lazy, and entitled one? Suggest you get another account (one your mother won't have access to) and prepare to GTFO.", "NTA and you need to immediately stop your mothers access to your account. I am glad she is getting  better, but she is stealing from you. Also you are not lazy, from what you said, you have helped her a lot since her poor judgement that ended the divorce. You should get Daughter of the year award for stepping up and supporting at your own sacrifice. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA. You are being neither selfish, entitled, nor lazy by a freaking mile and the audacity and hypocrisy of her saying that to you galls me to no end. She stole from you, period. I hate that someone who should be protecting and providing for you did the absolute opposite. I agree with opening an account she doesn't have access to and moving out as soon as possible. You deserve better.", "It seems like you have been failed by both parents. Your mom should have been providing for YOU! Your dad should have been paying child support and should have been invested in having you stay in school and graduating. Tell your mom in no uncertain terms that she needs a job, and you will be moving out as soon as you are able. NTA.", "NTA. There's a word for taking half an adult's pay out of their bank account -- theft. Legally you might not be able to do anything if it's a joint account with her name on it. \n\nWhat you need to do is immediately open a new account at a different bank in your name only and then switch your direct deposit over there. Then (if you are in the US) get a credit report on yourself to make sure she hasn't opened any accounts in your name. She has all of your personal information, after all. Put a temporary credit freeze on your credit with the three bureaus (if you are moving out wait until you get in your new place).\n\nIf you want to keep living with her, work out an arrangement on how to share expenses.  You're an adult so she has no obligation to provide for you even though you helped her in the past. Consider yourselves roommates. If it's her house, work out a fair rent. If it's a rental, work out how to split the rent and other expenses.", "Mom is stealing from you. Remove her from your account right away. You\u2019re an adult now. Are you contributing to the household? Have a real conversation about expectations and boundaries.", "NTA. You have sacrificed more than enough because of her bad decisions. You don't owe her this.", "NTA, get your mom out of your bank account and to be honest it's great that you're helping her but if she continues to hold you back in life you should probably kick her out and work on yourself and your future.", "Close out your joint account with her and open a new one in your name only so she can't get into it.  Never tell her your password.   NTA", "That\u2019s my thought, too.  Where\u2019s Dad in all of this and does he know what\u2019s been going on? Going from last year of high school to dropping out and working is a pretty significant life change, so hopefully he can provide some assistance and support to OP. \n\nAlso OP, NTA. Your mother is being unreasonable. While you\u2019ve been very helpful and supportive to her out of the goodness of your heart, she is not entitled to any of your paycheck and - honestly - shouldn\u2019t be looking to her kid for help in the first place. You\u2019re young, please prioritize your health and well-being. Is it possible got you to maybe move out of her place and move in with your dad or another relative or a friend? Finish school, if you can. You\u2019re young and have your whole life ahead of you. Don\u2019t let your mother\u2019s issues derail you.", "Since OP is 18 now, it's time for her to close the minor account her mom has access to and start a new account without access. The mother will continue this behavior - since she believes she's entitled to this money.", "GET HER OFF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. Go today and remove every penny. Open a new account at a new bank and hide everything. Move out ASAP. NTA.", "and get a new bank account at a different bank", "Change banks and don't tell her where your new account is. Common security questions are ones your parents probably know the answer to, as are those automatic questions you get doing SSN stuff like previous addresses and jobs.", "Time to change the pin number to your bank account. Family are always the first ones to steal from you.", "And if she isn't? Cause it doesn't say in the post.", "Because she's clearly an asshole, but the dad gets a 2 second mention when he's as responsible for every single thing that happened to OP.", "I think you didn't read my response to the last person who said this over an hour ago.", "I do not recommend that whatsoever.\n\nI recently had an issue with a client. Something happened with her business account, and they called her husband who was only on her personal account. The accounts were not linked in any way. They were not even the same type of account. First bit of advise I gave her was switch banks and don't use the same for personal and business.\n\nI've heard of it happening to other folks, but first time I got confirmation personally.\n\nDo not ever re-use the same bank when you have a hostile financial situation. You have plenty of options. Credit unions are a good choice anyways. Re-using the same bank can only have negative consequences, with no positive ones.\n\nThe bank may or may not refund the money. But it will certainly take time and work to get sorted out. It's all risk, no reward.", "No.  No he's not. OP chose to live with mom, knowing who her mom was and how she's treated people she supposedly loved.", "We don't have sympathy for the mom either.\n\nOur concern is over the dad's seeming lack of concern for his daughter.", "I don't think anyone should have sympathy for either parent. One destroyed the marriage, the other abandoned his own kid", "Where does it say she chose to live with her mom? \n\nAlso, a kid making a bad choice doesn't absolve a parent of any responsibility to them. This guy let his daughter drop out her senior year of highschool, within months of the divorce. Was he not checking in on her *at all*?", "I haven't checked other comments, but I'm not sure what happened with the dad. Did he check out completely? Or did her mom turn her against him and force him out of the picture? My guess is he took off and didn't look back, which is a shitty thing to do for your daughter, but we don't know.", "I was thinking that too. It happens a lot. She maybe talked so much shit about the dad and made herself out to sound like the poor victim and made her daughter feel like shit if she abandoned her. Who knows!", "I suppose it depends on how it went down too. Maybe he said fuck it and left them both behind. Maybe she trash talked him and layed the guilt down thick on her daughter and turned the daughter against him. Who knows. OP knows I guess.", "So? We don't know what the situation is.. There's a bunch of people in the world, including America that cannot communicate over distance.. It's not that strange. Whether it's 2023 or not", "Difficult to say without knowing the exact situation, like if he's around or if he moved away, what's his financial situation etc. Could be as simple as having groceries delivered, who knows exactly what OP would have needed to stay in school.", "At 17, you're generally asked with which parent you'd like to live with during divorce proceedings. Unless there is a huge safety concern, they honor that request. \n\nShe's not a kid. She's now a legal adult.  Maybe the daughter was lying, so mom wouldn't lose custody?  Maybe dad moved far away to be close to his family? We have no info on him other than he was a victim of the mother.", "That should be what the child support was being used for though.", "We know he was the victim of the mother, and that he let his daughter drop out her senior year to keep a roof over her head. Sorry absolutely nothing is going to justify that second part for me. I don't care if OP called him a stupid cuck to his face (which I seriously doubt she did anything remotely like that), a parent takes care of their kid. Write your shitty ex an extra check for a few months .\n\nAgain *at most* we are talking about 180 week days - the length of a school year.  No sin on OP's part justifies the lack of care her dad showed when the timeframe is so small, and the consequence is the kid has a HS diploma or not. Feel free to disagree, this guy is apparently a saint in your eyes because he got cheated on.", "Yes, it should be. But if that's not happening, would you let your kid drop out just to stick it to your ex if you have the resources to help your kid?", "No means a Saint, but no one is obligated to pay for another's lifestyle.  His body, his choice. I get you worship deadbeat mothers and think they shouldn't have any responsibility, but that's your thing.  She was stealing from her own child. What makes you think that extra check wouldn't be pocketed as well?", "Is he still talking with the kid? Is he trying to be in her life? If not, why? What has he done? As a parent, you don\u2019t give up on your kids. You ensure that they are ok, even if from afar.\n\nIt\u2019s not squarely on his shoulder as the mom is definitely the AH. However, as a parent, I would do everything to make sure my kid was safe and thriving as much as I could physically can. Don\u2019t exonerate the dad because we don\u2019t know the situation, but he isn\u2019t all to blame either.", "She was 17 when they got divorced. Custody is barely a thing at that point. Not to mention that if the mom was unemployed and unable to provide for the daughter, it would be VERY easy for him to obtain custody. He could've stepped in.", "If my kid refuses to move in with me? I'd report my ex to CPS and wait for the legal system to place them with me.  After a divorce, I doubt the father has the resources to support two households. If the kid knew of and supported the cheating, then I'd likely go NC for a while.", "Does the kid want the father in her life?  Why did she choose to stay and support her mom knowing she cheated? I don't think you give up on your kids, but you don't support your ex lying around being depressed because her meal ticket left.  If the girl won't live with him, what can he do?", "It's never very easy for a father to do anything in the court system.  If she didn't want to move, he can't force her.  By the time the proceedings got through court, she'd likely be a legal adult"]}
