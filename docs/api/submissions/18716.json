I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. We just came back from our honeymoon in Japan a week later and I got the wedding photos - my sister was photographer since she has her own business and wanted to gift us all the photos and videos. \n\nOne of my bridesmaids (Hannah 29F)'s dad passed sadly, freak accident before the wedding. She has a necklace he bought her a few years ago and she wanted to wear it on our wedding day, something she asked on the day. It didn't go with her dress at all, way too loud and long and I thought it detracted from her dress. However, I didn't see this as a huge hill to die on since I've read about editing wedding photos online and that it's a way for everyone to be happy. So, she wore it in the photos and I asked my sister if she could do me a solid and edit two versions of the photo - one copy with the necklace in for Hannah and one with the necklace without for me. I ended up having that photo printed and put up in the dining room of me and all of my bridesmaids.\n\nTom and I threw a BBQ to thank everyone once more for coming to the wedding. It was all going well until Hannah saw the edited photo without the necklace framed and on my wall. I explained and told her that I thought it was a nice way to compromise since I did say it didn't go with the outfit at the wedding. She wasn't happy and said the necklace meant a lot to her and it was rude to have it edited out. I apologised but pointed out that we gave her photos where she was wearing a necklace and that I wanted a photo with my original vision on my wall and there are photos of her where she is wearing the necklace. It was just this one photo of all my bridesmaids and I in front of our venue that I had edited. \n\nAll of the bridesmaids dresses were handmade by me to match my theme and as a nice memento and part of their thanks for being in my bridal party. If I'd known she wanted to wear the necklace, I would have designed her dress differently. She left pretty quickly after that and has refused to answer my calls or messages of me trying to apologise.\n\nWas this an AH move? She still got to wear the necklace to the wedding and has photos of her in it also but I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show, not her Dad's necklace.", "created_utc": 1685637308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xmbku/aita_for_photoshopping_a_wedding_photo/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My grandpa has been dead for twenty years, and sometimes I still catch my mom crying about it... because that's her dad. \n\nYour friend's feelings are still raw, and it felt like a jab to her. It wasn't. I know that, you know that, the other bridesmaids prolly know that, and your friend probably does too, but emotions are overwhelming. She just needs some time to get through grieving her father first... It was too soon, and that's not really anyone's fault. \n\nShe will be okay, but she's fragile right now. If I were you, I would take a deep breath, and just leave her alone for a week. Try again next week, but if she doesn't answer, don't spam her. Just tell her you're sorry the photoshopped copy upset her, that you didn't realize how strongly it would effect her, and that you weren't trying to devalue her father's necklace. Tell her you'll be here if/when she's ready. Then you just leave the ball in her court. She will contact you when she's ready, or she won't... and it's not your fault, it's not her fault, it's not even her dad's fault... it's just that pain makes you respond to things differently, and your friend is still in a lot of pain.", "NTA\nHannah got a picture of herself with the necklace, and is not harmed by the knowledge that a picture exists in which she is not wearing it.", "NTA what you did is pretty common and your friend is a bit dramatic IMO.", "NTA - The necklace may mean a lot to her, but it means nothing to you, the bride. Everyone at the wedding got to see it, and the photos still exist. I sure you even offered her a copy to have. \n\nYou having an edited version that you want to display in your home is totally your call.\n\nShe's being selfish by expecting you to display something that only has meaning for her and detracts from the aesthetic of your photos.", "NTA\n\nShe really has no reason to be offended.", "NTA. I think the way you handled it was very generous and accommodating", "NTA\n\nGeesh.  Wedding pictures are not like Harry Potter photos that capture the soul of the participants.  They're decorations at best (paper weights at worst).\n\nEditing out a color mismatch is fine.  Had you told me you gave her bigger boobs or slimmed her down, then she has the right to be offended.\n\nSaying, \"it didn't match the outfit, but I wanted you to be able to wear it\" is a more than acceptable compromise.  Give her a copy with the necklace and she can hang it at her house.", "NTA. She's doing too much.", "NAH but I don't really get why you felt this was necessary. \n\nYou allowed her to wear it on the day, because of sentimental value.  Nice.  But the \"look\" of your photo was so important you just had to edit it out? Your bridesmaids aren't dolls, and she was a part of your special day *as she was* in reality. This seems really shallow and I can see why she was hurt. \n\nYour comment **\"I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show\"** comes off as if the dress is more important to you than the people.  Not nice.", "NTA, you allowed it to be worn, and only edited one photo. Seems like your friends is still rather raw from the accident. Hopefully she'll apologize in the future for her overreaction to something that she'd only ever notice inside your home.", "NTA - You created a beautiful and respectful compromise. Hannah's grief may be clouding her adamant view of the photos. I agree, you took extra care that she has a photo memory of her wearing the necklace and you have a wedding photo memory you will enjoy. \n\nGrief is difficult and longer that most think. No need to coddle her but give her time and stay in touch in ways that make sense to you. Enjoy your wedded bliss.", "OMG, Your friend is ridiculous. NTA.", "Soft YTA\nI'm going against the grain. I understand that you wanted everything to be aesthetically perfect, and that in your eyes the necklace ruined it. But your friend came to your wedding to be your bridesmaid, despite still being in grief. That day she was wearing that (ugly) comforting object, because unfortunately the reality is not perfect sometimes. I think that cancelling out the necklace to her feels a bit like ignoring her grief, or hiding it because it is ugly. You did a good job compromising, but probably you could have been a bit more compassionate and let it go. I think people would not evin had notice the necklace in a group picture...unless the necklace was a real disgusting monster.", "NAH. You both have a point", "NTA I guess ..your pic your choice but kinda dickish move that s necklace can affect overall look. It's just me ..but I wouldn't have done it", "Very soft ESH\n\nNo issue with you editing the photos. Might have been nice of you to let her know you did the photo shopping so she didn't have to see it to find out. That might have hurt her feelings.\n\nHer reaction to the news is a little dramatic and while it's awful her father died suddenly, your wedding had nothing to do with that. You let her wear it that day. What more did she really expect from you?", "NTA you let her wear it it and you made sure she got pictures with her wearing it, you were both very understanding, nice and accommodating.", "NTA. Very nice compromise on your part. :)", "If you had already decided to Photoshop the necklace out, you should have told her. Lack of transparency leads to issues, especially where things have sentimental value.\n\nIt's your wedding, so if you don't want the necklace say so. Phitoshopping it's a bit of a YTA move.", "NTA You sound like a ki d and considerate friend. Your friend is still grieving and didn't handle the unexpected edit well.", "NTA.  While your friend's reaction is a bit much, she's grieving.  She's hurting.  And that grief of losing a parent doesn't just go away.  Are these printed photos in frames?  Or canvasses?  Because to help \"mend\" the friendship, I'd probably print the unedited version, put it in the frame, text her a picture and apologize.  Sub the photo out after your first anniversary.  But leave it in your house for the year.  Eventually this will blow over.  So sorry OP.  And congrats on your marriage!!", "From her perspective, you agreed she could wear something highly meaningful to her then blind-sided her with a picture where that item was edited out. Would it have been so difficult to mention it before she saw the pic?\n\nGentle ESH. You should have communicated this with her before inviting her to your home where she\u2019d see the picture\u2026and her reaction was over-the-top considering all the other pictures were left unedited.", "NTA but it is a sticky situation. I am going with NTA because you had full intent to be respectful, it was your wedding, and you could have just not allowed the necklace at all.\n\nThat being said, editing a photo of someone else to change their appearance is always a bit sticky. The best moral high ground would be to ask the person before editing, but that isn't always practical considering how ubiquitous photo editing is.\n\nA photo of someone is a representation of that person. When you edit that photo you run the risk of misrepresenting that person. The more problematic examples of this would be changing someone's skin tone or figure. A lesser example might be editing out a tattoo.\n\nYour friend is upset because for her the necklace was a representation of a part of herself. The edited photo showed a version of your friend that was missing that part of herself.\n\nI still land on NTA because it is just a photo, and just a necklace, but I would also recognize that your friend is facing some complicated emotions.", "NTA at all! You printed copies of both and have every right to have the edited one in your house", "YTA for thinking about aesthetic and not considering your friend's feelings. clearly she is still grieving. don't act surprised if she cuts you off over this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You let her wear the necklace. You even gave her the unedited print. You didn\u2019t even share the edit on social media, it\u2019s in the privacy of your living room. \n\nGrief does weird things to people. She\u2019s not through it yet. It could take years for her to be alright. Give her some time. When it\u2019s not so fresh, she\u2019ll probably see that you reasonably accommodated her and this isn\u2019t much of a transgression \n\nWe lost my mom in 2019. It\u2019s not a small thing that she\u2019s going through. It has ruined my little brother, to the extent where I recently threatened to cut him out of my own wedding if he doesn\u2019t start talking to a professional. For your friend, it probably won\u2019t take that long for her to see a little light.", "I think so too. I didn't stop her from wearing it on the day or try force her into not wearing it or anything", "Yeah that's the main thing which really pushed me to edit them. Her dress was not ruined by the necklace but they just didn't fit together and I wanted the dress I'd made to be the thing on show in the photo", "She does have a copy where she has the necklace as do the rest of the bridesmaids, it's just myself who has the Photoshopped version", "Yes, I did want the dresses to be on show because I'd put effort into them to make the day more special. It means a ton that my friends were willing to let me do this and it's a reminder of how we met to me, in university studying textile design. I didn't want her fathers necklace to overshadow my own sentimentality", "Yeah 100% I see that now about the grief. The only reason I wanted to have the attention on the dresses in that photo was because my bridesmaids looked stunning in them and I made them myself as a reference to how we met. Had the dresses been store bought it wouldn't have mattered to much to me. \n\nIt was quite jewel-ly, very long and was reflecting a lot of light. If it was smaller and matched the dress a bit more, I wouldn't have asked my sister to photoshop it out.", "Going to have to agree with this judgement. OPs friend is grieving, but came to the wedding anyway. She wanted to wear something that had more sentimental value to her than anything else, as part of that grieving process. While having two versions of the photo is a compromise, it's still pretty insensitive to what OPs friend is going through (grief is tough), because it places the importance of OPs \"pictures being perfect\" above that of their friend's grief, which shows a lack of compassion. Feel like people place way too much store in their \"wedding day being absolutely perfect\" that they lose sight of what weddings are supposed to be about.", "Yes that probably would have been the right thing to do. I was caught up in a lot of post wedding things and it didn't cross my mind", "I hadn't decided during the wedding, only when my sister forwarded me the photo. I didn\u2019t realise how it looked in the photo and it was detracting from the dress", "Thankyou! It is in a wooden frame on our wall. That's a good idea to make amends", "Yes I agree with that, I did not consider grief would be so overclouding considered she does have photos with the necklace on such as being sat for dinner with the bridal party. I didn't think 1 photo would be a huge deal", "I did consider her feelings hence why I let her wear the necklace at our wedding. If she'd have proposed the idea before the wedding I would have designed it differently so they both work together. No one else has the photoshopped version, it's only me", "I don't think she's dramatic, I mean her dad passed not too long ago.\n\nShe's probably super sensitive about everything around her dad for a while. Just let it go NAH", "Your bridesmaids are people, not props.  I feel sorry for you that you consider them like objects to arrange for aesthetic purposes.", "Maybe you can find an excuse to get your bridesmaids back together and have a picture of your creation exactly as you meant it to be? I see that you really put a lot of effort and feeling in those dresses, hopefully your friend will understand. After all brides are always expected to be a bit selfish :-)", "My wedding day was perfect even with the necklace. The photo memory that I wanted was of my 5 friends in handmade dresses personal to them and my wedding. We worked on those dresses together", "I still think YTA. you know how much that necklace means to your friend. you erased something of extreme importance to her for the sake of perfect wedding pictures.", "Which part of my post makes you feel that way?", "That's a good idea, maybe if we do a vow renewal of sorts I can ask them to come along with the dresses and remake Hannah's if she'd like", "Yes hence why I didn't make a fuss and let her wear it. The only reason I wanted to edit it out was because it made the photo less sentimental to me and those dresses remind me of how I became friends for life with my bridesmaids", "Objectifying your bridesmaids and stomping on that girl's grief.", "bs excuse, OP. if a necklace that currently means the world to your grieving friend takes away the sentimentality of a photo because it makes it less perfect then you likely don't value your friend at all.", "I don't think i'm objectifying my friends? The necklace was obscuring her dress which had sentimental value to me. Every dress I designed with each bridesmaid in mind\n\nI'm unsure of how I am stomping on her grief when i let her wear the necklace and I am the only one with the photo that was Photoshopped for my own sentimental reasons", "I don't think those two are related if i'm honest. Yes that necklace means a lot to her but sadly that necklace doesn't mean anything to me. What does mean more to me is the dresses I made with all of my friends input to make them special for the wedding. The necklace was huge, (not just like a simple charm on a chain) and it was detracting from my friends dress. Again, like i'd said in the post, if she'd asked me beforehand, I would have worked with her to design the dress so it matches with the necklace or I would have made adjustments to the dress but she brought it to the wedding and suddenly asked to wear it", "I know you're unsure of how you hurt your bridesmaid.  That is the problem right there.  She told you, you don't care, because your photos are more important than your relationships.", "I stand by my response.\nperfect photos do not triumph a friend's feelingd when they're valid.\ndon't be surprised if she cuts you off."]}
