I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. We just came back from our honeymoon in Japan a week later and I got the wedding photos - my sister was photographer since she has her own business and wanted to gift us all the photos and videos. \n\nOne of my bridesmaids (Hannah 29F)'s dad passed sadly, freak accident before the wedding. She has a necklace he bought her a few years ago and she wanted to wear it on our wedding day, something she asked on the day. It didn't go with her dress at all, way too loud and long and I thought it detracted from her dress. However, I didn't see this as a huge hill to die on since I've read about editing wedding photos online and that it's a way for everyone to be happy. So, she wore it in the photos and I asked my sister if she could do me a solid and edit two versions of the photo - one copy with the necklace in for Hannah and one with the necklace without for me. I ended up having that photo printed and put up in the dining room of me and all of my bridesmaids.\n\nTom and I threw a BBQ to thank everyone once more for coming to the wedding. It was all going well until Hannah saw the edited photo without the necklace framed and on my wall. I explained and told her that I thought it was a nice way to compromise since I did say it didn't go with the outfit at the wedding. She wasn't happy and said the necklace meant a lot to her and it was rude to have it edited out. I apologised but pointed out that we gave her photos where she was wearing a necklace and that I wanted a photo with my original vision on my wall and there are photos of her where she is wearing the necklace. It was just this one photo of all my bridesmaids and I in front of our venue that I had edited. \n\nAll of the bridesmaids dresses were handmade by me to match my theme and as a nice memento and part of their thanks for being in my bridal party. If I'd known she wanted to wear the necklace, I would have designed her dress differently. She left pretty quickly after that and has refused to answer my calls or messages of me trying to apologise.\n\nWas this an AH move? She still got to wear the necklace to the wedding and has photos of her in it also but I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show, not her Dad's necklace.", "created_utc": 1685637308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xmbku/aita_for_photoshopping_a_wedding_photo/", "score": 1080, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone at the wedding got to see it, and the photos still exist. I sure you even offered her a copy to have. \n\nYou having an edited version that you want to display in your home is totally your call.\n\nShe's being selfish by expecting you to display something that only has meaning for her and detracts from the aesthetic of your photos.", "NTA\n\nShe really has no reason to be offended.", "NTA. I think the way you handled it was very generous and accommodating", "NTA\n\nGeesh.  Wedding pictures are not like Harry Potter photos that capture the soul of the participants.  They're decorations at best (paper weights at worst).\n\nEditing out a color mismatch is fine.  Had you told me you gave her bigger boobs or slimmed her down, then she has the right to be offended.\n\nSaying, \"it didn't match the outfit, but I wanted you to be able to wear it\" is a more than acceptable compromise.  Give her a copy with the necklace and she can hang it at her house.", "NTA. She's doing too much.", "NAH but I don't really get why you felt this was necessary. \n\nYou allowed her to wear it on the day, because of sentimental value.  Nice.  But the \"look\" of your photo was so important you just had to edit it out? Your bridesmaids aren't dolls, and she was a part of your special day *as she was* in reality. This seems really shallow and I can see why she was hurt. \n\nYour comment **\"I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show\"** comes off as if the dress is more important to you than the people.  Not nice.", "NTA, you allowed it to be worn, and only edited one photo. Seems like your friends is still rather raw from the accident. Hopefully she'll apologize in the future for her overreaction to something that she'd only ever notice inside your home.", "NTA - You created a beautiful and respectful compromise. Hannah's grief may be clouding her adamant view of the photos. I agree, you took extra care that she has a photo memory of her wearing the necklace and you have a wedding photo memory you will enjoy. \n\nGrief is difficult and longer that most think.

I understand that you wanted everything to be aesthetically perfect, and that in your eyes the necklace ruined it. But your friend came to your wedding to be your bridesmaid, despite still being in grief. That day she was wearing that (ugly) comforting object, because unfortunately the reality is not perfect sometimes. I think that cancelling out the necklace to her feels a bit like ignoring her grief, or hiding it because it is ugly. You did a good job compromising, but probably you could have been a bit more compassionate and let it go. I think people would not evin had notice the necklace in a group picture...unless the necklace was a real disgusting monster.", "NAH.

While your friend's reaction is a bit much, she's grieving.  She's hurting.  And that grief of losing a parent doesn't just go away.  Are these printed photos in frames?  Or canvasses?

But leave it in your house for the year.  Eventually this will blow over.  So sorry OP.  And congrats on your marriage!!", "From her perspective, you agreed she could wear something highly meaningful to her then blind-sided her with a picture where that item was edited out. Would it have been so difficult to mention it before she saw the pic?\n\nGentle ESH.

I am going with NTA because you had full intent to be respectful, it was your wedding, and you could have just not allowed the necklace at all.\n\nThat being said, editing a photo of someone else to change their appearance is always a bit sticky. The best moral high ground would be to ask the person before editing, but that isn't always practical considering how ubiquitous photo editing is.\n\nA photo of someone is a representation of that person. When you edit that photo you run the risk of misrepresenting that person. The more problematic examples of this would be changing someone's skin tone or figure. A lesser example might be editing out a tattoo.\n\nYour friend is upset because for her the necklace was a representation of a part of herself. The edited photo showed a version of your friend that was missing that part of herself.\n\nI still land on NTA because it is just a photo, and just a necklace, but I would also recognize that your friend is facing some complicated emotions.", "NTA at all! You printed copies of both and have every right to have the edited one in your house", "YTA for thinking about aesthetic and not considering your friend's feelings. clearly she is still grieving. don't act surprised if she cuts you off over this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You let her wear the necklace. You even gave her the unedited print. You didn\u2019t even share the edit on social media, it\u2019s in the privacy of your living room. \n\nGrief does weird things to people. She\u2019s not through it yet. It could take years for her to be alright. Give her some time. When it\u2019s not so fresh, she\u2019ll probably see that you reasonably accommodated her and this isn\u2019t much of a transgression \n\nWe lost my mom in 2019. It\u2019s not a small thing that she\u2019s going through. It has ruined my little brother, to the extent where I recently threatened to cut him out of my own wedding if he doesn\u2019t start talking to a professional. For your friend, it probably won\u2019t take that long for her to see a little light.", "I think so too. I didn't stop her from wearing it on the day or try force her into not wearing it or anything", "Yeah that's the main thing which really pushed me to edit them. Her dress was not ruined by the necklace but they just didn't fit together and I wanted the dress I'd made to be the thing on show in the photo", "She does have a copy where she has the necklace as do the rest of the bridesmaids, it's just myself who has the Photoshopped version", "Yes, I did want the dresses to be on show because I'd put effort into them to make the day more special. It means a ton that my friends were willing to let me do this and it's a reminder of how we met to me, in university studying textile design. I didn't want her fathers necklace to overshadow my own sentimentality", "Yeah 100% I see that now about the grief. The only reason I wanted to have the attention on the dresses in that photo was because my bridesmaids looked stunning in them and I made them myself as a reference to how we met. Had the dresses been store bought it wouldn't have mattered to much to me. \n\nIt was quite jewel-ly, very long and was reflecting a lot of light. If it was smaller and matched the dress a bit more, I wouldn't have asked my sister to photoshop it out.", "Going to have to agree with this judgement. OPs friend is grieving, but came to the wedding anyway. She wanted to wear something that had more sentimental value to her than anything else, as part of that grieving process. While having two versions of the photo is a compromise, it's still pretty insensitive to what OPs friend is going through (grief is tough), because it places the importance of OPs \"pictures being perfect\" above that of their friend's grief, which shows a lack of compassion. Feel like people place way too much store in their \"wedding day being absolutely perfect\" that they lose sight of what weddings are supposed to be about.", "Yes that probably would have been the right thing to do. I was caught up in a lot of post wedding things and it didn't cross my mind", "I hadn't decided during the wedding, only when my sister forwarded me the photo. I didn\u2019t realise how it looked in the photo and it was detracting from the dress", "Thankyou! It is in a wooden frame on our wall. That's a good idea to make amends", "Yes I agree with that, I did not consider grief would be so overclouding considered she does have photos with the necklace on such as being sat for dinner with the bridal party. I didn't think 1 photo would be a huge deal", "I did consider her feelings hence why I let her wear the necklace at our wedding. If she'd have proposed the idea before the wedding I would have designed it differently so they both work together. No one else has the photoshopped version, it's only me", "I don't think she's dramatic, I mean her dad passed not too long ago.\n\nShe's probably super sensitive about everything around her dad for a while. Just let it go NAH", "Your bridesmaids are people, not props.  I feel sorry for you that you consider them like objects to arrange for aesthetic purposes.", "Maybe you can find an excuse to get your bridesmaids back together and have a picture of your creation exactly as you meant it to be? I see that you really put a lot of effort and feeling in those dresses, hopefully your friend will understand. After all brides are always expected to be a bit selfish :-)", "My wedding day was perfect even with the necklace. The photo memory that I wanted was of my 5 friends in handmade dresses personal to them and my wedding. We worked on those dresses together", "I still think YTA. you know how much that necklace means to your friend. you erased something of extreme importance to her for the sake of perfect wedding pictures.", "Which part of my post makes you feel that way?", "That's a good idea, maybe if we do a vow renewal of sorts I can ask them to come along with the dresses and remake Hannah's if she'd like", "Yes hence why I didn't make a fuss and let her wear it. The only reason I wanted to edit it out was because it made the photo less sentimental to me and those dresses remind me of how I became friends for life with my bridesmaids", "Objectifying your bridesmaids and stomping on that girl's grief.", "bs excuse, OP. if a necklace that currently means the world to your grieving friend takes away the sentimentality of a photo because it makes it less perfect then you likely don't value your friend at all.", "I don't think i'm objectifying my friends? The necklace was obscuring her dress which had sentimental value to me. Every dress I designed with each bridesmaid in mind\n\nI'm unsure of how I am stomping on her grief when i let her wear the necklace and I am the only one with the photo that was Photoshopped for my own sentimental reasons", "I don't think those two are related if i'm honest. Yes that necklace means a lot to her but sadly that necklace doesn't mean anything to me. What does mean more to me is the dresses I made with all of my friends input to make them special for the wedding. The necklace was huge, (not just like a simple charm on a chain) and it was detracting from my friends dress. Again, like i'd said in the post, if she'd asked me beforehand, I would have worked with her to design the dress so it matches with the necklace or I would have made adjustments to the dress but she brought it to the wedding and suddenly asked to wear it", "I know you're unsure of how you hurt your bridesmaid.  That is the problem right there.  She told you, you don't care, because your photos are more important than your relationships.", "I stand by my response.\nperfect photos do not triumph a friend's feelingd when they're valid.\ndon't be surprised if she cuts you off.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nOmg you wanted ONE photo where the dresses really shined.", "Nah but you're maybe a bit shallow.  Like, 'a yes, my ascetic is far more important than my friendship'.  On the other hand, she got to wear it, and have a picture, and it's not like your wedding photos will be seen by anyone other than your family.", "My mom died when I was in my early 20s so I can empathize with her. But I think she's being unfair. You let her wear it to the wedding and gave her unedited pictures. That went above and beyond. It should not matter to her what you're displaying in *your* house. I don't think grief entitles you to be rude and irrational. NTA", "Soft YTA. I can see why your friend is hurt, you erased the necklace that was important to her when she was in grief. I think you should have talked to her about it before inviting her to an event where she was going to see the edited picture.", "YTA.\n\nIf you didn't want her to wear it, you should have told her not to wear it, not edit it out like something to be embarrassed about. \n\nSimple as that.", "NTA. It\u2019s your picture in your house.", "How is she mad when she got the original lol. Please don\u2019t reach out to her because you did what you had to do even though apologizing wasn\u2019t needed. Like you let her wear it", "Yes I see that now. Admittedly both of my parents are still here and I don't know what it's like to lose someone so close and important. I am going to give her space and show her that I did put the original in a frame. I may move the Photoshopped version to our bedroom for me personally", ">Just tell her you're sorry the photoshopped copy upset her,\n\nSlight caution on wording this apology: don't say something to the effect of \"I'm sorry you feel that way about the edited photos\", because it ignores the fact that OPs actions caused their friend to be hurt. Regardless of OPs intentions, the impact of it is what matters to the friend. Instead, go with \"I'm sorry I edited the photos, and I'm sorry for hurting you\", which takes ownership for the actions that had a negative impact on the friend, regardless of the intentions. Don't try to justify why the photos were edited, as it will take away from the sincerity of the apology.", "I wouldn't say she was being selfish, more like she's still processing the loss of her father and lashed out. Not great, but understandable under the circumstances. From her point of view, seeing the necklace her father gave her removed from the photo may have reminded her how he was removed from her life, so to speak. OP, you didn't do anything wrong, but I would suggest giving your friend some time. She'll need you as she comes to terms with the loss.", "I'm sorry for your loss", "Thankyou, yes this was what it was all about. I just wanted to be able to properly see all the work we put in together to make it", "Yes I see that now. It just slipped my mind among various post wedding things I had to do that I had the edited photo on my wall", "I wasn't embarrassed about it? If I was I would have said no or I would have distributed Photoshopped photos to everyone. I'm the only one with the edited photo. I'm also not going to be heartless on my wedding day and tell her she can't wear something that reminds her of her dad", "[deleted]", "I agree with apologizing for hurting the friend's feelings, but I respectfully disagree that op should apologize for editing the photos. It was op's wedding and op's photos. I think that allowing the friend to wear the necklace and then editing as op saw fit was a more than fair compromise.\n\nEdit to fix a grammatical error.", "I make jewelry (mostly necklaces) and I can't tell you how many times I have a necklace I want to wear but just can't find a shirt/dress I like it with.  I completely understand not wanting a necklace in your photos that didn't work with the dresses you hand made.  NTA.  \n\nI understand your friend is upset but you followed her wishes day of and only obtained a memento of your original vision.  Your friend is being inconsiderate here.", "And you have every right to feel that way.  You didn't prevent her from wearing the necklace or even make an issue out of it.", "OP said she already has a copy where she is wearing the necklace", "Editing of the photos IS the action that hurt their friend. OP needs to be accountable for that.", "Yes that's probably for the best. I didn't think it would affect her so deeply given she had the photos with her necklace on", "If the day was perfect with the necklace, why even bother having an edited copy without the necklace? The photos are a record of said \"perfect day\" with the necklace. \n\nBy choosing to have an edited version of the photo, you're altering something about that \"perfect day\". \n\nWhile yes, it does take effort to collaborate on the dresses, you're still putting that over your friend's grief. \n\n\"She still got to wear the necklace to the wedding and has photos of her in it also but I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show, not her Dad's necklace.\" also shows you care more about the outfits, and not her father passing away, which is also contradicting what you said about the day being perfect with the necklace.", "Not sure I agree with this as it would also mean that she would need to destroy any edited photos.  She isn't sorry she edited the photos.  She is sorry that the edited photos caused pain to her friend.  Not the same thing.  She is NTA for doing the editing.  They are her photos.", "I only edited one as a personal keepsake to remind me of my bridesmaids and how much they helped me to really have my perfect wedding. There was no photoshopping of any other photos with Hannah in the necklace", "The day was perfect. I wanted to edit the photo because seeing those dresses make me think of my bridesmaids and how we designed them. Late nights over wine talking about our ideas. Shopping for fabrics. Everyone being excited for the wedding. Swapping ideas. Those memories are sentimental and really valuable to me. The dresses were more about our pre-wedding bonding with my bridesmaids in the same way we worked together on university projects. They remind me of how I met them and how lucky I am that we are still such good friends years later. \n\nThe necklace was obscuring my friends dress and I wanted one photo where all the dresses were clear and we had the venue in the back and it was just a great photo of the wedding and getting to have my best friends on my side while I marry the love of my life", "How is a real picture of your friend doing the effort of going to celebrate you despise her grief less sentimental? I don't get it. The dress was still there. The necklace could have been a symbol of her love for you, and instead you told her that it diminishes that love.", "It doesn't make her grief less sentimental. I don't know what it's like to lose a parent, that's huge and i'm very glad I don't know what it is like. \n\nIn the photo, the necklace hung well past the neckline and it added some glare into the photo which obscured the details of the dress we had spent ages together designing and getting right for both us. That's what the dresses reminded me of, our design process, the excitement of it all, getting to bond with my friends in the lead up to my wedding. I wanted those details in the photo of the dress because I want to be able to see them clearly in 50 years and remember those memories", "It tells her that her grief and her loss are less important that a few details on a dress. It tells her that her being there with her dress is not good enough for you to find the picture sentimental and that you wished she hadn't shown her love for her dead father because of some details. In 50 years, the necklace would remind you that your fried was there for you despise everything. How's that less valuable and sentimental to you than a few details?", "I am literally trying to apologise but she isn't taking my call. Of course I care that I hurt my friend", "Then that would be what is best for her. At the end of the day, she didn't communicate it to me and I did all I could to accommodate her. She also knew how special it was to be able to talk with her to design a dress that we both loved for the wedding. I let everyone know if they wanted to wear accessories, we can incorporate them in", "Because that necklace sadly is a reminder of Hannah losing her father. Her presence at my wedding day is enough to remind me she was there for me. There are also many other photos of her wearing the necklace. \n\nThose details are something we spent a lot of time together as friends and a reminder of how we met. Those details represent the memories of the buildup to the wedding with all of my bridesmaids and how hard they helped me plan and design my dream wedding.", "I won't get through to you so this is my last comment.\n\nAt the BBQ you told her \"I wanted a photo with my original vision on my wall \"  This translates to \"I needed to remove your hideous jewelry that you insisted on wearing to my wedding just because someone died.  His death, and your bad taste, was inconvenient to my artistic vision.\"", "Really? You think that in her grief she should have thought that you would care for how the necklace looks with the dress, right before the ceremony, to the point where you need to delete it from the official photo on the living room? Mate.", "The necklace is a reminder of her love for him, just like the dress is a reminder of your mutual love. But if you need a fake picture that really upsets your friend to be reminded of that love, maybe you care more about the idea of the friendship than the friendship itself. \n\nIf you were my friend, I would really consider if I want a friendship like that.", "Fair enough, although your comment is not really a translation", "Yes. She could have told me a day before the wedding and I would have dropped everything to alter the dress. To me, that's a like a top level emergency", "Why do you think I edited the necklace out in the first place? It's a reminder of how close my bridesmaids and I got during the lead up to the wedding. It is literally a photo representation of our closeness and friendship. \n\nI think I may be phrasing it wrong to you or something. It's similar to a photo of the wedding cake details or the photos Tom had taken of his cuff links with our initials on them and date of our wedding. The necklace was obscuring details on her dress and I wanted 1 photo where I could see them clearly", "NTA... you show extra kindness in letting her wear it that day. There is no reason to have it her way on your wall.", "NAH the dresses were very important and you had a vision for each one. It was an integral part of your wedding. I can also see her side where I am sure it was a gut punch to see a memento of her father erased, after he had just passed away. I hope this doesn\u2019t break your friendship, I think you just have to come with a lot of compassion for her because she really just lost her dad.", "NAH- she's grieving and oversensitive at the moment, you did nothing bad. I think it's cool you still  gave her pics with the necklace on, that was thoughtful.  Your version of the pics doesn't matter to the extent that she's taking it.  But, again, grief makes everything hard for a while.", "NTA.. pretty solid compromise if you ask me", "YTA - Personally I hate the idea of just editing things out of pictures that you don't like. I also hate that people think their wedding pictures are more important than the people in those pictures. So I'm definitely going to be biased with this one. Having some basic empathy goes a long way, even if it means looking at a necklace that wasn't quite your \"image\" of your wedding.", "YTA I'm in the minority here but I don't get it. Is it really that much of an eyesore, especially when you know the context of it? Is the dress really that much more important? Ah yes, there's the photo with my friend who I had to edit to fit my aesthetic...\n\nIt's not a compromise if the other party doesn't know about it, you should've talked to her about it first.

Your last sentence says a lot about you.", "NTA\n\nThe necklace is important to her, not you.  It's your wedding photos.  Were you close to her dad at all?  It's not like you're trying to erase her dad from her life, you were already more accommodating than most brides by allowing her to wear it.  I feel like it was a perfect compromise where you weren't even obligated to make a compromise.", "NAH.\n\nI think you made a good compromise in the fact that you weren't all bridezilla saying she cannot wear this necklace when it doesn't match the dresses that you(!) made your bridesmaids! However, I can tell you that I was grieving my father's death so deeply for so long and felt it so much that I can also understand her reaction to seeing the photo on your wall. If you didn't tell her that you were going to do that, she took that very personally - probably as if you didn't care about how she was grieving her father. That's how I interpret her reaction. Grief is a freaking monster.", "YTA - you're hyperfocused on one piece of jewelry on someone instead of celebrating your special day. WHO CARES. You sound like a control freak - if it wasn't the necklace, you'd complain about someone's hairstyle. If it wasn't the hair you'd complain about someone's shoes.

It being a surprise to her probably made this situation a lot worse than it had to be.", "NAH\n\nIt probably triggered a feeling of him being \"erased\" from the picture, and after his sudden death, that idea hits really hard in a vulnerable spot.\n\n Grief is weird and never linear.

This is a picture that OP has put up for herself in her own home.", "If you're photoshopping the picture anyway, why not photoshop the dress so the necklace fits better, instead of removing the necklace? Would it be as simple as a color change, so the silhouette of the dress you made is still intact?", "OP *wasn't wrong* to edit the photos though. She's not sorry for that, she's sorry for the hurt being caused but she feels she has a right to have a version she likes.", "Thank you for providing a solid apology. \n\nPeople don\u2019t know how to apologize anymore.

In this case, there is no blame to be had. \n\nExample. I drop a box on your foot because I am not paying attention to what im doing.. that's my fault and you deserve a direct apology for my carelessness. But if I set a box down and then you stub you toe on it, I'll still apologize because \"I'm genuinely sorry that a totally reasonable thing I did ended up causing you pain\" but I'm not going to apologize for placing the box there to begin with. In both instances, my placing the box there is what led to you being hurt, but only in one case did I actually do anything wrong. The wording of my apology in either case should reflect that difference", "I mean, sure for the sake of your friendship and out of consideration for what she's going through then you should let it go.

Let her decompress and think it over. I hope she is able to see that this is a reasonable compromise.", "NTA\n\nYou could have legitimately asked her not to wear it but compromised.  She has the photo for her memories and you have your photo for yours.  \n\n It could just be that at the moment she is still trying to cope with the grief of loosing her dad - seeing the edited photo with the necklace missing could have been a sudden shock, expecting to see the necklace there.

It's your wedding and your home, and you are free to have an edited photo from you wedding hanging in your home. But having lost a parent myself, I can imagine what your friend might be feeling. She may very well not be mad at you exactly, just upset with the whole situation and needing time. For instance when I see my mom's old workplace, it makes me sad to know that her presence has been erased. Logically I know there's nothing wrong about that (can't work there while dead) but it's still just sad to know that something related to her existence has disappeared from this world.

Sorry.", "YTA\n\nThe moment you decided your vision matters more than  what the wedding is supposed to represent (a celebration of you, your husband, and your loved ones) you turned into an asshole in my eyes.\n\nSure, your wedding, your pictures, you are technically allowed to do whatever you want with them. But you may be entitled to do something and still be an asshole because of it. Those things are compatible.\n\nYou have chosen aesthetics over something deeply important for someone you supposedly care about. And that's what Hannah has seen. Her grief is part of her now. And you are telling her that \"well, I wanted things to look a specific way so I'm going to edit this away regardless of what it means to you, because appearances matter more to me than feelings\". Way to go.\n\nI don't know when wedding celebrations became this obsessive display of fake perfection, a performance of aesthetics rather than something emotionally valuable for the people getting married, but it's honestly quite sad the amount of stories like these we see here.", "When my dad passed away, a couple of years ago, I suddenly cherished every single item that he had ever personally picked out for me.

I could understand if someone photoshopped out the necklace in a photo of her at a memorial service for her Dad.

It\u2019s sad she lost her dad, but OP legit HANDMADE HER BRIDESMAIDS\u2019 dresses. She spent months on them, and wanted them to be the focus, not some gaudy monstrosity that made her friend feel better. She even allowed said friend to wear it, have it in photos, and gave her pics of herself in this huge, flashy, \u2018heirloom\u2019. While everyone has a right to grieve, no one has the right to force their grief onto others, or expect others to kowtow to every single demand they make for eternity just because they suffered a loss. OP is NTA, her friend is overreacting due to her sadness at losing her dad, and her jealousy that she won\u2019t have a perfect wedding like OP planned hers to be, because her own dad won\u2019t be at it, and she insisted on clinging to a hideous reminder of her dad ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY to get sympathy, attention, and to make sure everyone knew she was such an amazing friend for \u2018being there despite her grief\u2019, when in fact she was definitely basking in it. I was the MUA for a friends\u2019 wedding in the 3 months following the death of my son\u2014I didn\u2019t carry his teddy and throw a fit that someone had photoshopped it out for their private collection, I did what sane and rational people do, and I put myself aside for one day to support my friend. If she didn\u2019t feel like she could do that for one day, she probably should\u2019ve just not come to the wedding. I don\u2019t care if I sound like an asshole, grief and trauma are not an excuse to force everyone else to be miserable with you.", "The bride made the dress herself, in that case it is that important.

That is a ton of work.", "No. I have chosen the dress and the memories Hannah and I had in making it over her necklace. This is about my own memories on my wedding day and having one photo to show all the hard work we did", "Exactly! I sympathize with the friend, losing a family member is very difficult; however, OP was very kind to let her wear the necklace in the first place given it didn\u2019t match the dress at all. Any wedding I\u2019ve been in or attended as a guest, the bride picked out the jewelry herself or gave a specific description of what she wanted (long vs short, gold vs silver, etc.) to complement the dresses without taking any attention away from them.

Father's day is a nightmare for me... and the fact someone thought about it and acknowledged that it's not a happy day for many people, was just so impactful for me. \n\nI think they sent one for Mother's Day, too, but I don't have issues with that one yet.", "I assumed it was a comfort thing but I did also ask if my friends had anything they wanted to wear and they had free reign in the jewellery choice", "I wondered this too, every time I have been a bridesmaid, the bride provided the jewelery.", "My guess would be that OP had the traditional elements of her wedding that involved her father, like him walking her down the aisle and the father-daughter dance. Maybe the friend isn't married and anticipated that seeing those things would remind her that she'll never experience them with her own father. Maybe she is married and she anticipated remembering her own experience of her wedding (when her father walked her down the aisle and her father-daughter dance) and all of the complicated feelings that would emerge with those memories being right in front of her.

The dresses matter because of all the memories we have over making them. This scenario would be different if I'd bought them from a shop but they were handmade by us", "I do. But I think it's deeper than that. OP put her own hard work into those dresses. It is more than the way they look. It is her hard work and she wants one picture where the dresses look like she intended. One out of hundreds and only for her own use.", "If that were true, then the OP would've told the friend to take the necklace off the day of the wedding, or edited every photo to remove the necklace and wouldn't have had the original photo with the necklace printed out to give to the friend.

The friend is grieving and their reaction is definitely born out of grief. There are NAH", "She gave her friend a copy of the photo with the necklace in it. The edited one is OP's personal copy, not even one she's blasting on social media. What's wrong with having the picture look the way that means the most to the people that it means the most to? Friends gets with the necklace, OP gets without.", "No, the semi argument/uncomfortable feeling obviously.", "Yes. Because jewelery is part of the bridesmaid look. I would never just assume I could wear a random necklace. \n\nI have a memorial tattoo for my father on my  shoulder. My friend asked if she could edit it out of one of EHR wedding photos where it is visible before she printed it for her parents. I said yes. Even if she hadn't asked, I would be fine with it.\n\nI do think OP was wrong to not mention to Hannah she was going to edit the photos but I also think Hannah was wrong to just wear the necklace and I think OP's was a minor mistake since it was only one photo and displayed in OP's home, not on social media."]}
