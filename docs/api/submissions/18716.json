I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him. We just came back from our honeymoon in Japan a week later and I got the wedding photos - my sister was photographer since she has her own business and wanted to gift us all the photos and videos. \n\nOne of my bridesmaids (Hannah 29F)'s dad passed sadly, freak accident before the wedding. She has a necklace he bought her a few years ago and she wanted to wear it on our wedding day, something she asked on the day. It didn't go with her dress at all, way too loud and long and I thought it detracted from her dress. However, I didn't see this as a huge hill to die on since I've read about editing wedding photos online and that it's a way for everyone to be happy. So, she wore it in the photos and I asked my sister if she could do me a solid and edit two versions of the photo - one copy with the necklace in for Hannah and one with the necklace without for me. I ended up having that photo printed and put up in the dining room of me and all of my bridesmaids.\n\nTom and I threw a BBQ to thank everyone once more for coming to the wedding. It was all going well until Hannah saw the edited photo without the necklace framed and on my wall. I explained and told her that I thought it was a nice way to compromise since I did say it didn't go with the outfit at the wedding. She wasn't happy and said the necklace meant a lot to her and it was rude to have it edited out. I apologised but pointed out that we gave her photos where she was wearing a necklace and that I wanted a photo with my original vision on my wall and there are photos of her where she is wearing the necklace. It was just this one photo of all my bridesmaids and I in front of our venue that I had edited. \n\nAll of the bridesmaids dresses were handmade by me to match my theme and as a nice memento and part of their thanks for being in my bridal party. If I'd known she wanted to wear the necklace, I would have designed her dress differently. She left pretty quickly after that and has refused to answer my calls or messages of me trying to apologise.\n\nWas this an AH move? She still got to wear the necklace to the wedding and has photos of her in it also but I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show, not her Dad's necklace.", "created_utc": 1685637308, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13xmbku/aita_for_photoshopping_a_wedding_photo/", "score": 3976, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everyone at the wedding got to see it, and the photos still exist. I sure you even offered her a copy to have. \n\nYou having an edited version that you want to display in your home is totally your call.\n\nShe's being selfish by expecting you to display something that only has meaning for her and detracts from the aesthetic of your photos.", "NTA\n\nShe really has no reason to be offended.", "NTA. I think the way you handled it was very generous and accommodating", "NTA\n\nGeesh.  Wedding pictures are not like Harry Potter photos that capture the soul of the participants.  They're decorations at best (paper weights at worst).\n\nEditing out a color mismatch is fine.  Had you told me you gave her bigger boobs or slimmed her down, then she has the right to be offended.\n\nSaying, \"it didn't match the outfit, but I wanted you to be able to wear it\" is a more than acceptable compromise.  Give her a copy with the necklace and she can hang it at her house.", "NTA. She's doing too much.", "NAH but I don't really get why you felt this was necessary. \n\nYou allowed her to wear it on the day, because of sentimental value.  Nice.  But the \"look\" of your photo was so important you just had to edit it out? Your bridesmaids aren't dolls, and she was a part of your special day *as she was* in reality. This seems really shallow and I can see why she was hurt. \n\nYour comment **\"I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show\"** comes off as if the dress is more important to you than the people.  Not nice.", "NTA, you allowed it to be worn, and only edited one photo. Seems like your friends is still rather raw from the accident. Hopefully she'll apologize in the future for her overreaction to something that she'd only ever notice inside your home.", "NTA - You created a beautiful and respectful compromise. Hannah's grief may be clouding her adamant view of the photos. I agree, you took extra care that she has a photo memory of her wearing the necklace and you have a wedding photo memory you will enjoy. \n\nGrief is difficult and longer that most think.

I understand that you wanted everything to be aesthetically perfect, and that in your eyes the necklace ruined it. But your friend came to your wedding to be your bridesmaid, despite still being in grief. That day she was wearing that (ugly) comforting object, because unfortunately the reality is not perfect sometimes. I think that cancelling out the necklace to her feels a bit like ignoring her grief, or hiding it because it is ugly. You did a good job compromising, but probably you could have been a bit more compassionate and let it go. I think people would not evin had notice the necklace in a group picture...unless the necklace was a real disgusting monster.", "NAH.

While your friend's reaction is a bit much, she's grieving.  She's hurting.  And that grief of losing a parent doesn't just go away.  Are these printed photos in frames?  Or canvasses?

But leave it in your house for the year.  Eventually this will blow over.  So sorry OP.  And congrats on your marriage!!", "From her perspective, you agreed she could wear something highly meaningful to her then blind-sided her with a picture where that item was edited out. Would it have been so difficult to mention it before she saw the pic?\n\nGentle ESH.

I am going with NTA because you had full intent to be respectful, it was your wedding, and you could have just not allowed the necklace at all.\n\nThat being said, editing a photo of someone else to change their appearance is always a bit sticky. The best moral high ground would be to ask the person before editing, but that isn't always practical considering how ubiquitous photo editing is.\n\nA photo of someone is a representation of that person. When you edit that photo you run the risk of misrepresenting that person. The more problematic examples of this would be changing someone's skin tone or figure. A lesser example might be editing out a tattoo.\n\nYour friend is upset because for her the necklace was a representation of a part of herself. The edited photo showed a version of your friend that was missing that part of herself.\n\nI still land on NTA because it is just a photo, and just a necklace, but I would also recognize that your friend is facing some complicated emotions.", "NTA at all! You printed copies of both and have every right to have the edited one in your house", "YTA for thinking about aesthetic and not considering your friend's feelings. clearly she is still grieving. don't act surprised if she cuts you off over this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You let her wear the necklace. You even gave her the unedited print. You didn\u2019t even share the edit on social media, it\u2019s in the privacy of your living room. \n\nGrief does weird things to people. She\u2019s not through it yet. It could take years for her to be alright. Give her some time. When it\u2019s not so fresh, she\u2019ll probably see that you reasonably accommodated her and this isn\u2019t much of a transgression \n\nWe lost my mom in 2019. It\u2019s not a small thing that she\u2019s going through. It has ruined my little brother, to the extent where I recently threatened to cut him out of my own wedding if he doesn\u2019t start talking to a professional. For your friend, it probably won\u2019t take that long for her to see a little light.", "I think so too. I didn't stop her from wearing it on the day or try force her into not wearing it or anything", "Yeah that's the main thing which really pushed me to edit them. Her dress was not ruined by the necklace but they just didn't fit together and I wanted the dress I'd made to be the thing on show in the photo", "She does have a copy where she has the necklace as do the rest of the bridesmaids, it's just myself who has the Photoshopped version", "Yes, I did want the dresses to be on show because I'd put effort into them to make the day more special. It means a ton that my friends were willing to let me do this and it's a reminder of how we met to me, in university studying textile design. I didn't want her fathers necklace to overshadow my own sentimentality", "Yeah 100% I see that now about the grief. The only reason I wanted to have the attention on the dresses in that photo was because my bridesmaids looked stunning in them and I made them myself as a reference to how we met. Had the dresses been store bought it wouldn't have mattered to much to me. \n\nIt was quite jewel-ly, very long and was reflecting a lot of light. If it was smaller and matched the dress a bit more, I wouldn't have asked my sister to photoshop it out.", "Going to have to agree with this judgement. OPs friend is grieving, but came to the wedding anyway. She wanted to wear something that had more sentimental value to her than anything else, as part of that grieving process. While having two versions of the photo is a compromise, it's still pretty insensitive to what OPs friend is going through (grief is tough), because it places the importance of OPs \"pictures being perfect\" above that of their friend's grief, which shows a lack of compassion. Feel like people place way too much store in their \"wedding day being absolutely perfect\" that they lose sight of what weddings are supposed to be about.", "Yes that probably would have been the right thing to do. I was caught up in a lot of post wedding things and it didn't cross my mind", "I hadn't decided during the wedding, only when my sister forwarded me the photo. I didn\u2019t realise how it looked in the photo and it was detracting from the dress", "Thankyou! It is in a wooden frame on our wall. That's a good idea to make amends", "Yes I agree with that, I did not consider grief would be so overclouding considered she does have photos with the necklace on such as being sat for dinner with the bridal party. I didn't think 1 photo would be a huge deal", "I did consider her feelings hence why I let her wear the necklace at our wedding. If she'd have proposed the idea before the wedding I would have designed it differently so they both work together. No one else has the photoshopped version, it's only me", "I don't think she's dramatic, I mean her dad passed not too long ago.\n\nShe's probably super sensitive about everything around her dad for a while. Just let it go NAH", "Your bridesmaids are people, not props.  I feel sorry for you that you consider them like objects to arrange for aesthetic purposes.", "Maybe you can find an excuse to get your bridesmaids back together and have a picture of your creation exactly as you meant it to be? I see that you really put a lot of effort and feeling in those dresses, hopefully your friend will understand. After all brides are always expected to be a bit selfish :-)", "My wedding day was perfect even with the necklace. The photo memory that I wanted was of my 5 friends in handmade dresses personal to them and my wedding. We worked on those dresses together", "I still think YTA. you know how much that necklace means to your friend. you erased something of extreme importance to her for the sake of perfect wedding pictures.", "Which part of my post makes you feel that way?", "That's a good idea, maybe if we do a vow renewal of sorts I can ask them to come along with the dresses and remake Hannah's if she'd like", "Yes hence why I didn't make a fuss and let her wear it. The only reason I wanted to edit it out was because it made the photo less sentimental to me and those dresses remind me of how I became friends for life with my bridesmaids", "Objectifying your bridesmaids and stomping on that girl's grief.", "bs excuse, OP. if a necklace that currently means the world to your grieving friend takes away the sentimentality of a photo because it makes it less perfect then you likely don't value your friend at all.", "I don't think i'm objectifying my friends? The necklace was obscuring her dress which had sentimental value to me. Every dress I designed with each bridesmaid in mind\n\nI'm unsure of how I am stomping on her grief when i let her wear the necklace and I am the only one with the photo that was Photoshopped for my own sentimental reasons", "I don't think those two are related if i'm honest. Yes that necklace means a lot to her but sadly that necklace doesn't mean anything to me. What does mean more to me is the dresses I made with all of my friends input to make them special for the wedding. The necklace was huge, (not just like a simple charm on a chain) and it was detracting from my friends dress. Again, like i'd said in the post, if she'd asked me beforehand, I would have worked with her to design the dress so it matches with the necklace or I would have made adjustments to the dress but she brought it to the wedding and suddenly asked to wear it", "I know you're unsure of how you hurt your bridesmaid.  That is the problem right there.  She told you, you don't care, because your photos are more important than your relationships.", "I stand by my response.\nperfect photos do not triumph a friend's feelingd when they're valid.\ndon't be surprised if she cuts you off.", "NAH", "NTA\n\nOmg you wanted ONE photo where the dresses really shined.", "Nah but you're maybe a bit shallow.  Like, 'a yes, my ascetic is far more important than my friendship'.  On the other hand, she got to wear it, and have a picture, and it's not like your wedding photos will be seen by anyone other than your family.", "My mom died when I was in my early 20s so I can empathize with her. But I think she's being unfair. You let her wear it to the wedding and gave her unedited pictures. That went above and beyond. It should not matter to her what you're displaying in *your* house. I don't think grief entitles you to be rude and irrational. NTA", "Soft YTA. I can see why your friend is hurt, you erased the necklace that was important to her when she was in grief. I think you should have talked to her about it before inviting her to an event where she was going to see the edited picture.", "YTA.\n\nIf you didn't want her to wear it, you should have told her not to wear it, not edit it out like something to be embarrassed about. \n\nSimple as that.", "NTA. It\u2019s your picture in your house.", "How is she mad when she got the original lol. Please don\u2019t reach out to her because you did what you had to do even though apologizing wasn\u2019t needed. Like you let her wear it", "Yes I see that now. Admittedly both of my parents are still here and I don't know what it's like to lose someone so close and important. I am going to give her space and show her that I did put the original in a frame. I may move the Photoshopped version to our bedroom for me personally", ">Just tell her you're sorry the photoshopped copy upset her,\n\nSlight caution on wording this apology: don't say something to the effect of \"I'm sorry you feel that way about the edited photos\", because it ignores the fact that OPs actions caused their friend to be hurt. Regardless of OPs intentions, the impact of it is what matters to the friend. Instead, go with \"I'm sorry I edited the photos, and I'm sorry for hurting you\", which takes ownership for the actions that had a negative impact on the friend, regardless of the intentions. Don't try to justify why the photos were edited, as it will take away from the sincerity of the apology.", "I wouldn't say she was being selfish, more like she's still processing the loss of her father and lashed out. Not great, but understandable under the circumstances. From her point of view, seeing the necklace her father gave her removed from the photo may have reminded her how he was removed from her life, so to speak. OP, you didn't do anything wrong, but I would suggest giving your friend some time. She'll need you as she comes to terms with the loss.", "I'm sorry for your loss", "Thankyou, yes this was what it was all about. I just wanted to be able to properly see all the work we put in together to make it", "Yes I see that now. It just slipped my mind among various post wedding things I had to do that I had the edited photo on my wall", "I wasn't embarrassed about it? If I was I would have said no or I would have distributed Photoshopped photos to everyone. I'm the only one with the edited photo. I'm also not going to be heartless on my wedding day and tell her she can't wear something that reminds her of her dad", "[deleted]", "I agree with apologizing for hurting the friend's feelings, but I respectfully disagree that op should apologize for editing the photos. It was op's wedding and op's photos. I think that allowing the friend to wear the necklace and then editing as op saw fit was a more than fair compromise.\n\nEdit to fix a grammatical error.", "I make jewelry (mostly necklaces) and I can't tell you how many times I have a necklace I want to wear but just can't find a shirt/dress I like it with.  I completely understand not wanting a necklace in your photos that didn't work with the dresses you hand made.  NTA.  \n\nI understand your friend is upset but you followed her wishes day of and only obtained a memento of your original vision.  Your friend is being inconsiderate here.", "And you have every right to feel that way.  You didn't prevent her from wearing the necklace or even make an issue out of it.", "OP said she already has a copy where she is wearing the necklace", "Editing of the photos IS the action that hurt their friend. OP needs to be accountable for that.", "Yes that's probably for the best. I didn't think it would affect her so deeply given she had the photos with her necklace on", "If the day was perfect with the necklace, why even bother having an edited copy without the necklace? The photos are a record of said \"perfect day\" with the necklace. \n\nBy choosing to have an edited version of the photo, you're altering something about that \"perfect day\". \n\nWhile yes, it does take effort to collaborate on the dresses, you're still putting that over your friend's grief. \n\n\"She still got to wear the necklace to the wedding and has photos of her in it also but I wanted my the outfits I made for my bridesmaids to be on show, not her Dad's necklace.\" also shows you care more about the outfits, and not her father passing away, which is also contradicting what you said about the day being perfect with the necklace.", "Not sure I agree with this as it would also mean that she would need to destroy any edited photos.  She isn't sorry she edited the photos.  She is sorry that the edited photos caused pain to her friend.  Not the same thing.  She is NTA for doing the editing.  They are her photos.", "I only edited one as a personal keepsake to remind me of my bridesmaids and how much they helped me to really have my perfect wedding. There was no photoshopping of any other photos with Hannah in the necklace", "The day was perfect. I wanted to edit the photo because seeing those dresses make me think of my bridesmaids and how we designed them. Late nights over wine talking about our ideas. Shopping for fabrics. Everyone being excited for the wedding. Swapping ideas. Those memories are sentimental and really valuable to me. The dresses were more about our pre-wedding bonding with my bridesmaids in the same way we worked together on university projects. They remind me of how I met them and how lucky I am that we are still such good friends years later. \n\nThe necklace was obscuring my friends dress and I wanted one photo where all the dresses were clear and we had the venue in the back and it was just a great photo of the wedding and getting to have my best friends on my side while I marry the love of my life", "How is a real picture of your friend doing the effort of going to celebrate you despise her grief less sentimental? I don't get it. The dress was still there. The necklace could have been a symbol of her love for you, and instead you told her that it diminishes that love.", "It doesn't make her grief less sentimental. I don't know what it's like to lose a parent, that's huge and i'm very glad I don't know what it is like. \n\nIn the photo, the necklace hung well past the neckline and it added some glare into the photo which obscured the details of the dress we had spent ages together designing and getting right for both us. That's what the dresses reminded me of, our design process, the excitement of it all, getting to bond with my friends in the lead up to my wedding. I wanted those details in the photo of the dress because I want to be able to see them clearly in 50 years and remember those memories", "It tells her that her grief and her loss are less important that a few details on a dress. It tells her that her being there with her dress is not good enough for you to find the picture sentimental and that you wished she hadn't shown her love for her dead father because of some details. In 50 years, the necklace would remind you that your fried was there for you despise everything. How's that less valuable and sentimental to you than a few details?", "I am literally trying to apologise but she isn't taking my call. Of course I care that I hurt my friend", "Then that would be what is best for her. At the end of the day, she didn't communicate it to me and I did all I could to accommodate her. She also knew how special it was to be able to talk with her to design a dress that we both loved for the wedding. I let everyone know if they wanted to wear accessories, we can incorporate them in", "Because that necklace sadly is a reminder of Hannah losing her father. Her presence at my wedding day is enough to remind me she was there for me. There are also many other photos of her wearing the necklace. \n\nThose details are something we spent a lot of time together as friends and a reminder of how we met. Those details represent the memories of the buildup to the wedding with all of my bridesmaids and how hard they helped me plan and design my dream wedding.", "I won't get through to you so this is my last comment.\n\nAt the BBQ you told her \"I wanted a photo with my original vision on my wall \"  This translates to \"I needed to remove your hideous jewelry that you insisted on wearing to my wedding just because someone died.  His death, and your bad taste, was inconvenient to my artistic vision.\"", "Really? You think that in her grief she should have thought that you would care for how the necklace looks with the dress, right before the ceremony, to the point where you need to delete it from the official photo on the living room? Mate.", "The necklace is a reminder of her love for him, just like the dress is a reminder of your mutual love. But if you need a fake picture that really upsets your friend to be reminded of that love, maybe you care more about the idea of the friendship than the friendship itself. \n\nIf you were my friend, I would really consider if I want a friendship like that.", "Fair enough, although your comment is not really a translation", "Yes. She could have told me a day before the wedding and I would have dropped everything to alter the dress. To me, that's a like a top level emergency", "Why do you think I edited the necklace out in the first place? It's a reminder of how close my bridesmaids and I got during the lead up to the wedding. It is literally a photo representation of our closeness and friendship. \n\nI think I may be phrasing it wrong to you or something. It's similar to a photo of the wedding cake details or the photos Tom had taken of his cuff links with our initials on them and date of our wedding. The necklace was obscuring details on her dress and I wanted 1 photo where I could see them clearly", "NTA... you show extra kindness in letting her wear it that day. There is no reason to have it her way on your wall.", "NAH the dresses were very important and you had a vision for each one. It was an integral part of your wedding.

The necklace obviously meant a lot to her and she is grieving so maybe it would have been better to exercise some extra empathy and let her honor her loved one. Realistically everyone is going to forget about what you posted online anyway in a matter of weeks so I don\u2019t think it was worth alienating her.

The looks that she handmade all the dresses for.", "I know but I'm trying to think of a compromise to the compromise in case when you talk to her she still is upset and stays offended by the edited picture. I don't know her so my brain is worse casing that she threatens to end the friendship over this so perhaps that's an option if she really is that upset. Probably an unnecessary measure but having an additional back up for when you talk to her might be good. But maybe I'm jumping to conclusions that she won't understand your perspective.", "Sounds like you loved the dresses more than the women in them. Lesson learned for your \"friends.\"", "Hmmmm.  \n\nIn the case, I'd say it's probably somewhere between NAH or ESH.  You're both coming from pretty valid places, so whether or not anyone crosses into AH territory really depends on how both of you handle this from here on out.  \n\nFor your part, you displayed the edited photo so i guess I'm wondering what you expected to happen when she'd inevitably see it?  She'd obviously notice the lack of necklace and given her circumstances, you can't be surprised that she'd be sensitive about it.  In the moment, she was completely blindsided by what you did so she's NTA for now, but if she decides to fixate and fester on this then she could become one. \n\nThat said, at a certain point it's on her to get that this is your wedding and your wedding photos, and you did make the effort to only edit your version of the pic.  If you'd let her know ahead of time how the pics turned out and that you were thinking of editing your version, there would be no issue.  People tend to get AH passes around weddings and grief so it can get pretty sloppy when both are in play.  I'd say NAH for now, but there's a possibility for an escalation to ESH on both your ends.  A solid face-to-face outta diffuse this.  Good luck.", "Yeah that\u2019s kinda one way or the other for me. I\u2019ve been trying to be ok with everyone and their mother posting and tagging photos of us from our wedding.

It truly is a NAH situation. OP didn't go Bridezilla on her and allowed her to wear the necklace even though it didn't go with her bridesmaids dresses. I have read soo many stories where brides were absolutely garbage to their bridesmaids when they face some tragedy and the bride is all \"but muh weddin\". I agree this was a very good compromise. She sees it as a slight. Just talk to the friend, reminisce about her dad, and be there for her. I agree, don't bring up the pictures unless she does. And if she does, apologize for the fact she felt hurt. This isn't something worth being a stickler over \"being right.\" No, OPs not an AH but her friend is hurting and acknowledging that hurt will go a long way towards healing.", "I am sorry for the loss of your dad. That\u2019s a hard thing to deal with in any circumstance. \n\nMy heart goes out to anyone in this situation. My own dad passed under circumstances very similar to yours. At the time, all the siblings had been married to their spouses for many years, except for my youngest sister. She had just graduated from college but was marrying her longtime boyfriend and moving to his hometown (she had an established career already and was already scheduled to transfer to the branch in her fianc\u00e9\u2019s city immediately after their honeymoon, and he had an extremely good career already established there). After dad passed, they thought about postponing the wedding, but everything was already paid in full and arrangements had been planned in detail for their new life together. They would\u2019ve postponed anyway, but my Mom insisted that they didn\u2019t. She said she knew how much my dad was looking forward to her partner \u201cofficially\u201d joining the family, and loved her SO like one of his own, and dad would never want them to postpone their wedding, especially since they had waited 2 years for Sis to graduate so they could marry & move to city (for her).\n\nSo, they got married as planned, except our only brother walked her down the aisle. It was bittersweet, but we were all happy that they went ahead with the original plan. (I have to admit, there\u2019s a few seconds of their wedding video where the videographer had to pass very closely to where my family was seated together, and you can hear a couple of muffled sobs from my sister and me, but otherwise everything went off without a hitch.)\n\nI don\u2019t remember all the details of the wedding. To be honest, the next 18 months are kind of foggy to remember. I know that, like you, I went through most of that period on autopilot, more or less.

This is a single piece of jewelry on a single person. Realistically, how much is it covering?\n\nHer friend's pain is real, raw, and current. For now, while she can see her friend is still grieving, she can do this one thing. She has the edited photo she wanted. That was more for *her* than anyone else. And if she can make a tiny consession in the name og being understanding and loving toward her friend, isn't that *more* important than a single retouched photo?\n\nAfter some time and healing for her friend then OP can do what she wants.

Her father would still have passed in a year or 10. What doesn\u2019t change now or 10 years from now is that the editing of the photo had nothing to do with her friends fathers memory and everything to do with just displaying the dresses that she worked on in her own home. Her fathers necklace is still very much present in the other photos which are also on display.\n\nYes the photo is for her. That\u2019s why is displayed in her living room where she presumably spends a lot of time. Where she likes it in her decor. She shouldn\u2019t have to hide it away in a specific room in her home.

I think, OP, what you've not quite understood (and there's no reason you should if you haven't been through, which is why it's NAH) is that the necklace is Hannah way of keeping her dad with her. For Hannah, you didn't photos hop out a necklace, you erased her dad from the photo.\n\nHannah needs to realise the opposite. For you, it's a piece of jewellery that you don't particularly like the look of in that particular photo. For you it becomes an unwanted focus of the photo because it niggles you. Just like it might if there was an awkward shadow falling across someone's face.\n\nYou both have different, valid perspectives, it's just hers hits a little harder.

Main character syndrome lol.", "NTA. \n\nYour friend is grieving and this situation I believe is being impacted by her grief. That being said, you are absolutely allowed to edit out the necklace on a photo you printed. It isn't rude, and it is an incredibly important day.. You let her wear it but chose to have some pictures without the necklace, but was very considerate to make sure she had unedited pictures. \n\nGrief brings up so many emotions and in my experience the emotions can be misplaced or triggered in ways that aren't logical. The only thing I can think of since i don't have the context of your friendship, is that you had a relationship with her dad as well and she looked at the necklace as a way for both of you to have him in your wedding. When you erased that, it's as though he didn't really mean anything to you. \n\nIf this kind of reaction is out of character for your friend, then I'd say it's grief/hurt feelings and I'd give some space to process then ask her to talk.. and come with compassion.", "NTA no. You didn\u2019t actually do anything wrong but your friend just lost her dad. You seems to be trivializing it maybe to her removing the necklace because you think it\u2019s ugly when it\u2019s the symbol that matters.  I think she will be ok.
