Initially, it seemed to bring us closer together but one day in May last year she asked me to look after my niece and nephew the next day for 8 hours as she had to be somewhere (it was first thing in the morning as I started my shift and she didn\u2019t mention it was an emergency or anything so I was unaware as to why) I was on my third 12 hour shift in A&E, the next day was my day off and then I was back in again for another shift after that. I explained to her it was my day off and I was really looking forward to doing nothing (not literally nothing I still needed to do general household chores but just a more chilled day than normal). Besides that, I was struggling with crippling anxiety and depression and had recently started taking medication for this which your body needs to adjust to for the first few weeks. Also, I\u2019d started the job a month after our Mom passed and quickly began to realise it was a very triggering environment for me. She didn\u2019t reply and honestly since then, I could count on one hand how many times we have spoken. \n\nTHAT DAY\u2026 just before that very conversation, something happened at work that caused me to have a panic attack, afterwards my manager passed some hurtful comments about me and the situation and that was the day I went off work on the sick for 6 months.

She usually took them to my Mom\u2019s for her to look after them or her Mother in laws. My Mom had terminal cancer and used to care for my Nan as well as looking after the two children at times during the school holidays. My sister just kind of expected people to help out at times if she had no childcare and it was often last minute. It frustrated all of the family, including my brother, Mom and Nan - hope this helps.", "Thank you so much for your kind and helpful reply. \nMany people have told me exactly that. She is not me and I am not her so we both probably don\u2019t understand each other, why we do things a certain way or how we handle things. But I have always tried to maintain a good relationship with her no matter how difficult she has made it. \nI have accessed lots of counselling and still am at the moment, it is a great relief for me to be able to get everything off my chest. I\u2019m still in an immense amount of pain and only wish she could see I\u2019m still suffering and I wasn\u2019t just being awkward at the time. This silly feud we seem to have got mixed up in just really isn\u2019t helping me, and it\u2019s definitely not helping me niece or nephew. We are all missing out on relationships when life is so short, she surely knows that. \nUnfortunately, after my Nan passed the relationships with greater family such as aunts and uncles completely broke down and then after Mom passed my relationships with my small family has completely broke down too, even after I tried so hard to keep everyone together.", "Thank you for your reply. \nI feel like you completely understand where I\u2019m coming from. I felt like I was screaming on the inside but nobody could see how badly I was suffering. I was drowning with work, family commitments, grief, mental illness. All I wanted was for her to understand it wasn\u2019t coming from a place of spite, genuinely just trying to get through each day.", "Thank you for your reply. \nThat\u2019s what everyone has said, she is the big sister she should be there for me. Although, just because she is the big sister doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t struggling herself I always have how she\u2019s feeling in mind it\u2019s not just my feelings in this situation. Maybe she\u2019s annoyed and feels I wasn\u2019t there for her in her time of need but it\u2019s more so how she\u2019s treating me now that I find really upsetting.", "Thank you so much for your reply. \nExactly, I was in no fit position mentally to look after two children all day. Another thing I tried to explain and wished she would understand or agree. That was all it took that day for me to have a complete breakdown so it just shows how bad my mental state was. Yeah I agree with that, I offered to have them for the day when I was feeling better months later and she made it feel like I wanted them now on my terms.", "Thank you so much for your kind reply. \nThank you, I do think it\u2019s probably a bit of both from both sides I just wish we could move past it now!\nTo be completely honest, I have always struggled with anxiety but didn\u2019t really know it was anxiety.. it\u2019s only been the last few years I have really acknowledged it for what it is. Then since my Mom passed it has got so much worse, debilitating in fact. I tried to explain to her a few months after this initial conversation but still didn\u2019t feel like she understood. Again, I\u2019m really not trying to make this about me but I just wanted her to know I wasn\u2019t doing it out of spite I was just in a bad place and I was working on it. I took them out for the day around this time and we had a great day. The relationship continued ok after this or so I thought but then we hadn\u2019t spoken since February this year, I don\u2019t ever hear from her any more and whenever I message she usually doesn\u2019t reply. I really would love to but don\u2019t know how to approach this whole situation, maybe sit down with her and just say right let\u2019s just get stuff off our chest and see if we can move forward? \nThank you so much.", "Thank you for replying, genuinely I appreciate any help with this. There is so much more to this than I could type. I don\u2019t blame her for asking at all and completely understand she just needed someone to watch the children, I was just in such a bad place mentally and it\u2019s so upsetting when you feel people don\u2019t understand. I just needed a day to myself. She has over the years often expected me to just look after them as I worked term time in a nursery so I was off for the holidays, completing disregarding any of my plans and making me feel guilty for not looking after them. She would say \u2018it\u2019s ok she\u2019s off work she can have them\u2019 to my Mom. I just think it\u2019s unfair she has stopped speaking to me and stopped them from speaking to me also. I wasn\u2019t trying to be spiteful at all.", "I get that I have stated in previous comments I also have her feelings in mind and get that she obviously needed me at that time, but I wasn\u2019t mentally fit to look after two children and just feel she thought I was being spiteful and awkward. I went home that day on the sick for 6 months, can you imagine my niece and nephew being in my care when I had that mental breakdown? I\u2019m happy they were somewhere safe and away from it. I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to expose them to that. But when you are experiencing a mental health crisis it\u2019s really hard to see between the lines because your mind is just so blurred. \nThe fact work was triggering actually was because there was an ill patient in a hospital bed screaming out for someone to help her as she was uncomfortable, just like our Mom used to scream for us to move her while we cared for her at home. Not that you need to know but just for context, she had cancer all over her body and often couldn\u2019t lie in the same position for a long time so we had to move her around. That\u2019s why it triggered me because it reminded me of my poor Mom screaming out in pain. No sympathy needed, it\u2019s me that felt that trigger so it\u2019s fine that you don\u2019t understand. This was only 6 months after we\u2019d lost our Mom and I shouldn\u2019t have been working but didn\u2019t realise at the time how bad I was. \nI have since tried to make amends on many occasions and yet she still acts extremely cold towards me.

Even if they weren\u2019t also struggling with their own health issues, this is a tiring work load. \n\nThey only had one day off (not a 2-day weekend) before doing another 12 hour shift. \n\nThe correct priority there was sleep. Not working (babysitting) for a long day (8 hour minimum). \n\nThere is no indication in the post that it was an emergency for the sister, so I don\u2019t know where you invented that from - and OP confirms in a comment that sister never said what the \u201csomewhere she has to be\u201d was. You can guarantee (because she\u2019s clearly the dramatic type to cut contact over 1 refusal to babysit!) that if sister genuinely had an important emergency, she would have mentioned it to guilt OP into babysitting. \n\nOP is NTA - and almost certainly better off without this sister in her life.", "Thank you so much for replying. This is all I\u2019m trying to say I just needed a day to rest my mind\u2026 and sleep!  I really wasn\u2019t trying to be spiteful", "Thank you for your reply. \nI intend to. It\u2019s so hard adjusting to life without your loved ones, counselling is the only thing I have to try and move forward with life! \nI felt so desperate for help with this situation that\u2019s why I tried here. I will feedback to my counsellor the responses I\u2019ve had as honestly any support from a different perspective is helpful for me right now to try and get my head round this mess.", "Thank you for your reply, I genuinely appreciate any opinions/perspectives!", "Thank you for your reply. \nI just can\u2019t understand it, to some it may seem like I caused this by saying I wouldn\u2019t look after the children but I don\u2019t feel that justifies keeping us away from each other. I feel we are all missing out. Especially now I\u2019m doing better I\u2019d be more than happy to look after them but it\u2019s an extremely awkward situation. I genuinely felt I was being reasonable. \nThank you\u2026 It\u2019s really hard not to!", "Sounds like sister not talking to you is a good thing", "Oh no! I'm so sorry", "Could you perhaps try reaching out to the extended family?  Aunts and uncles would hopefully want to be in touch with you if there was a good relationship beforehand.\n\nIt sounds like your Nan was the social glue holding everyone together, it can be additionally devastating to feel you're losing all the family connections.", "You were navigating life's stormy seas, burdened by tempests of work, family, and inner turmoil. Your plea for understanding was a lighthouse amidst the darkness. \n\n*Remember, explaining your shipwreck won't resonate with all. Some prefer the surface to the depths. Cast your anchor towards those who see your tempest and remain steadfast.*", "Right now you should focus on your mental health and getting yourself back to a good place. I also want to assure you that regardless of your mental health you have every right to say no to babysitting on your day off. Some people unfortunately are very entitled and seem to think that when they have children it becomes everyone's problem and responsibility. \n\nIm also very sorry for the loss, and i help you feel better soon", "My best friend of 30 years struggles with depression a lot. I luckily never had these problems. Due to her depression we ended up in a lot of fights and almost ended our friendship. I tell you this, to give you a point of view that your sister may have. \n\nWith my best friend I had to accept and understand that **I don't understand anything** about what she is going through mentally. We managed to sit down, each give our point of view without being jugdemental or assign blame, and openly say how we would like the friendship to go forward. We each tried to work on better communication and show more understanding. And most importantly we decided that the past is the past, we will only look forward from that point on and not rehash anything or hold grudges. \n\nThis worked really well for us, hence the 30yr friendship. Maybe you could do something similar with your sister? Good luck!!", "So six months after your mom dies you work in a hospital exposed to sick patients everyday but the day your sister needs help is the day that you decide you have mental health issues and get triggered so bad you have a mental breakdown because you work in a hospital. Yeah I don\u2019t blame her for thinking you are full of it. You just didn\u2019t want to watch her kids and that is your right but it doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t the A", "Believe me. I know. Not even a week ago I paused to remember my mothers passing. The pain never goes away but with counseling and determination I\u2019ve kept going. You\u2019re doing great. Hang in there. Sending a lot of positive energy your way.", "Sorry for no verbosity. On phone. Her ask was outrageously long and you can't demand that from others esp when she never tried to build a good relationship with you. My sibs and I get along and never expected child care from each other", "You are welcome. \n\nYou should adress this with a therapist, as to how to deal with your sisters entitlement. How to distinguish between a reasonable request from her and when she becomes demanding. How much help from you is reasonable to offer and how to remind her of her place when you say no to one of her requests. \n\nThis won't be done in a few sessions and you'll question yourself if you have denied her something reasonable. But a good therapist will give you the tools at hand to sit down in a quiet moment and come to the point where you belief in your own judgment of a situation.", "Doesn\u2019t feel like it!", "Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think it will be possible to repair the relationships. There was so much tension when my Nan passed and lots of petty arguments (while none of us knew our Mom had 12 months to live) so lots of time wasted and things said by everyone really in the heat of the moment. They made it clear the day of my Moms funeral they had a relationship with my sister but not me. My sister didn\u2019t like them until my Mom passed away and my Mom despised them so it\u2019s very upsetting to know now they all are in contact but that\u2019s completely her choice and it doesn\u2019t change how I feel about her.", "Thank you, I really appreciate it.", "Thank you so much for your reply. I really appreciate it. \nYes absolutely, every day is hard work but I do hope that some day it will be easier! I agree, I feel if I\u2019d asked her to do something for me but it was her day off I absolutely wouldn\u2019t fall out with her for it! I completely understand what it\u2019s like to need time for yourself which seems ironic as I didn\u2019t say yes in this situation but I\u2019ve since found out that afterwards say a few months after this, she asked my brother to babysit and he said no because he wanted to get his hair cut that day\u2026 so it just seems a bit unfair to me that she has cut me off from her life but not him? They are still quite close \nThank you so much.", "I feel that is extremely true, it\u2019s hard to understand unless you\u2019ve been through it yourself. And that\u2019s totally fine! Not everyone understands everything and I was willing to try and explain that my mind obviously just works different to hers and how I deal with things is different, hence why I acted the way I did in that particular situation. I would\u2019ve loved if she\u2019d have tried to show a little understanding but I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I was just talking complete rubbish? I don\u2019t know maybe it\u2019s just me, I think people with mental health issues just feel they are judged no matter what so it\u2019s very hard. \n\nThat sounds like a great idea. I would love to be able to do that. She is on holiday at the moment so I\u2019m going to wait until she\u2019s back before I say anything, I\u2019d really just love to move past this as even though I\u2019m still struggling, I\u2019m in a much better place now than I was! \n\nThank you so much for your help and advice!", "Ok let me explain again seeing as you seem to know so much about my life and my life choices but keep getting Eve thing wrong lol \nI got the job in October as after losing my Nan I wanted a job with less hours so I could spend more time with my mom and it was also the hospital where she was admitted, where my sister also worked, so we said we could both take turns to visit while we were on shift. As it was covid only one person could visit a day. The day I left my old job, my sister called to say mom would be on palliative care as they could do no more for her. By the time I\u2019d started my job 2 months later, Mom had already passed away. I\u2019d got a house in the august before this all happened so yes I needed a job and obviously if you have payments to make you have to have an income of some sort\u2026 I didn\u2019t receive any benefits in the 2 months I was off and was grateful how everything happened as it meant I got to spend the final weeks with my Mom. This wasn\u2019t the first time this had happened, I suffered with panic attacks often and there had been a couple of times I\u2019d gone home but initially work were very understanding. Even I thought I bet they think why have we employed someone who is emotionally struggling but I tried so hard to get through it. Also just to add, my job was a receptionist not like a frontline doctor so I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be exposed to patients in cubicles screaming out in pain, I thought I\u2019d be booking patients in with broken bones, falls etc so until you\u2019re in that environment you have no idea what it\u2019s like. You see all kinds of people and situations. The day I \u2018decided I have mental health issues\u2019 the lead nurse took me aside to ask why I was upset and when I told her what my manager had said she said \u2018ignore her. I was off with anxiety for 14 months it\u2019s horrible. Take as much time as you need\u2019 and she was a nurse, it can affect anyone and your breaking point can be at any time. It\u2019s often unpredictable and you can\u2019t understand why you feel that way. Again, your mind is extremely blurred and it just takes one comment or anything to tip you over the edge. Hopefully you never experience mental health as the way you speak about it is alarming lol", "Everything*", "Thank you so much for your kind comment. I am so sorry to hear about your Mother. I believe it\u2019s a pain that you only truly understand once it happens to you and it is the worst form of torture. \nThank you so much. The same to you as well, take care and look after yourself x", "No worries at all!\nYeah, especially as she worked in the same hospital doing the same shifts so she knew how draining it was! I really don\u2019t think I\u2019m that bad of a person for just wanting a bit of time to myself, obviously I wanted a nice sleep but also just to be able to do washing and general tidying etc that I don\u2019t get time to do after a 12 hour shift! \nI feel I have always tried very hard, I used to get the bus to hers every Sunday for years so I could spend the day with the kids and maintain a good relationship with everyone. \nThank you for your reply!", "That\u2019s great. Thank you so much. I have a session on Thursday so this is definitely something I will bring up with her. \nI\u2019ve had a mixture of comments, mostly positive but some slightly negative but thought it was best to bring it up with people who don\u2019t know me as the opinions will be completely honest so I really appreciate it!", "No, new things that are good for us don\u2019t usually feel at all good. You seem to be used to being ordered around by your sister so there is suddenly massive hole in your life.

She has always been very bossy and everyone felt they were walking on eggshells shells around her. My Mom and Nan always use to say \u2018just ignore her she was always a miserable baby\u2019 lol but I\u2019d just kind of accepted as I got older that we were just two very different people. She\u2019s more laid back whereas I\u2019m an anxious mess lol \nThank you so much I will have a look.", "Thank you, you\u2019ve been so helpful! X", "Welp, you have bee ordered to ignore her and her demands", "If I knew everyone would bow down to me whenever I demanded something, I would be laid back also. Some day she may come back into your life and take up like she left off. Do some back exercises to strengthen your spine so when you say no again it won't hurt so much.\n\nIf she only likes you when you do things for her, she isn't much of a sister. NTA at all.", "NTA. There are relatives and then there\u2019s family. \nYou are related. Choose your family. One that will support and nurture you. In the meantime, work on you. Counseling would help. Also find a meaningful pastime and don\u2019t let her live rent free in your head.", "NTa\n\nYOur sister is an entitled AH. YOU did nothing wrong.", "Thank you so much for your reply, I really appreciate all opinions and perspectives. I just wish we could move forward from it, it seems like such a little thing to fall out over, especially when I\u2019ve said previously I\u2019m busy and unable to look after them and she\u2019s never reacted like this.", "NTA\n\n>this is why she doesn\u2019t really speak to me any more\u2026\n\nSometimes the trash takes himself out.", "I was forced to be the (free) babysitter for my nephews for several hours a day for years.\nMy sister never was grateful, but my nephews love me.", "Thank you so much for taking to time to reply to this. \nThankfully I have an amazing partner and his family are exceptional, my Mom and Nan were extremely fond of them so I\u2019m grateful to still have them in my life. Counselling is a great help, but I just feel so horrible about this situation and feel I can\u2019t move forward with my life with this lingering over me, it just doesn\u2019t feel right. I really don\u2019t like falling out with anyone, confrontation anything like that so it\u2019s not helping my anxiety at the moment!", "Thank you so much for your reply. \nLots have people have said the same, that it\u2019s for the best and that sometimes toxic people need to be cut off even if they\u2019re family. It\u2019s just so hard. My brother and sister are the only people who truly know what I\u2019m going through and what it feels like (after losing Mom) so it\u2019s hard not to have her to talk to, I still speak to my brother thankfully.", "Thank you so much for your reply. I completely understand that! It can be hard work at times, especially if you\u2019re not feeling good mentally. \nSuch a hard situation.", "She is probably suffering.  ASKING for help is ok.", "Give yourself some grace. Grieving is different for each person. I take walks with my dog and in my down time read \u201cbrain popcorn\u201d books. Especially funny ones. Just little mental breaks throughout the day. It\u2019s been very helpful.", "Absolutely, I completely appreciate that. I think at the time I couldn\u2019t believe she couldn\u2019t see how much of a mess I was in, but looking back and with my understanding now I guess we both just reach out in different ways, maybe that was her way of reaching out to me and I just didn\u2019t see it like that at the time. If that\u2019s the case then that\u2019s completely on me, I\u2019d definitely like to make it right.", "That\u2019s very true. I love to take walks with my little dog as well! There is something so freeing about walking when you have a busy mind. Thank you for your help and advice! Take care!"]}
