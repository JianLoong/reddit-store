{"id": 21415, "submission_id": "14rdckl", "title": "AITA for defending my pregnant fianc\u00e9s attitude problem toward my family?", "selftext": "I met my fianc\u00e9 6 years ago and she came in to my life with 3 kids from her previous relationship. Their dad isn't around. I consider these children mine, 100%. We had no intentions of having another baby. I thought that I was infertile, as her and I were never \"safe\" during these 6 years and there was never so much as an \"oh fuck\" moment. Kids weren't completely out; we just didn't plan it. Anyways, since we got together we have both gained a pretty significant amount of \"comfort weight\". I personally went from 180 to 250 in these past 6 years and she went from like 120 to 230. So, as one could imagine, this pregnancy is a bit more on the uncomfortable side for her due to her weight. But anyways, she is 7 months pregnant now and oddly enough, she's only 228 right now, meaning she's lost weight and she's currently all belly. Still, it's uncomfortable. \n\nNow, my family has a screwed up way of thinking. My oldest sister was never able to have kids and adopted. Therefore she has no idea what it's like to carry a child. My other sister AND my mom both worked up until the day they delivered their children and think all women should be able to do the same. So, we went to visit them for a week and the amount of expectations they have for my fianc\u00e9 is repulsive. They will make her get up from the couch as soon as she sits down to go look at something irrelevant or get on her case if she doesn't immediately tend to our youngest son (he has ADHD and no impulse control so he can be a handful). But they generally wait until I've left or I'm out of sight to start in with their expectations or demands and if she gets pissy with them because they keep barking orders or making her feel like crap for not being on top of anything, they complain about her attitude problem. \n\nWell, yesterday (I didn't realize the full extent at this point) my mom and (infertile) sister cornered me to talk to me about her attitude and said \"she definitely needs therapy, you definitely need to watch her around the baby when she's born due to post partum psychosis\" etc etc. So I said \"maybe if you guys got off her fucking back for 2 seconds she wouldn't have an attitude. She's sweet as a peach to me and the kids. It's only you 2 that she has a problem with.\" Anyways, we were told to leave because now I had an attitude and refused to acknowledge that my fianc\u00e9 is wrong and have stated that until we apologize to them for making them feel like shit for \"pointing out the obvious\" we would not be welcome back.\n\nETA: one commenter mentioned my son and being on top of him due to him needing extra care so I want to dive in to that for a moment. My son is NOT mean or harmful to others. He stims, a lot and is generally speaking a loud kid. Or he will do repetitive things over and over and over again. He's not harming anyone, but my family thinks my fianc\u00e9 should be on his case 24/7. If he so much as asks for a pop more than once, they are on my fianc\u00e9s case. It's small shit that they find annoying; not him being harmful to anyone. Also, me mentioning the weight is relevant. Due to her weight she is in a lot more pain than she's used to dealing with. Even getting up from a sitting position is hard for her a lot of the time, so her being pregnant and being asked to get up multiple times is putting a strain on her body and we were told by the doctor that it was because of her current weight.", "created_utc": 1688569690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rdckl/aita_for_defending_my_pregnant_fianc\u00e9s_attitude/", "score": 410, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It just seemed like an unnecessary detail when your family simply has a toxic culture around childcare and expectations of motherhood in general.

The issue is that she has a doctor telling her not to do this, you're telling them that, and they're not respecting it.
