Neither of us was born into a particularly wealthy family, but we both prioritized learning to manage our finances and have invested a lot of effort into our careers. My husband\u2019s brother (I\u2019ll call him Sam) ended up in a tight situation 5 years ago, he had an alcohol problem to begin with, and then his GF accidentally got pregnant and they had twins to deal with - and they were barely managing to afford the rent on a 1 bedroom with a roommate. Plus student loan debt. \n\nMy husband wanted to help his brother, because his parents couldn\u2019t really afford to, and I was okay with it because we did have money to spare, and I really did feel for them. We supported them for almost a year - they lived with us, and once sam recovered from his addiction and they moved out, we still gave them significant financial help. Over the last few years, they\u2019ve been doing better and better - they have paid off most of their debt and own a small home. \n\nA few weeks ago, they invited us on vacation with them - I was happy to see the twins after so long, and my husband was happy to spend some time with his brother. It was a weeklong stay at a nice resort, and I was surprised and pleased that they\u2019d gone from no cash at all to being able to afford a holiday for 6 people. 2 days after we got home, Sam sent me a message saying that we should pay $1500 for our share of the trip. I was shocked, because they didn\u2019t say anything about us paying when they invited us. It also seemed strange that they\u2019d split the cost including both of our airfares, when my husband and I live much closer to the destination and had much lower airfare costs than Sam\u2019s family did. \n\nI wrote back saying that we would not be paying because we thought they were inviting us as family, and not as paying guests. I said they should have mentioned us paying our share before the trip if they wanted to. He wrote back quite angrily and said family is all very well, but family doesn\u2019t mean you can take advantage of someone\u2019s kindness. This rubbed me the wrong way, so I went through some of our old financial records and sent him an estimate of how much we\u2019d spent on his family over the years. I said if you don\u2019t want to take advantage of anyone\u2019s kindness, then please start paying us back for all this and we\u2019ll pay for the vacation. He didn\u2019t respond, but apparently called and yelled at my husband over the whole thing. \n\nMy husband thinks I was needlessly petty and that it was cruel of me to rub it in their faces that they needed help from us \u201ca long time ago\u201d. He says we should just pay and forget about it, because it\u2019s selfish of me to expect them to feel like they owe us for something we did of our own free will. And it\u2019s true that I would be less annoyed about them asking us to pay, if not for how much we helped them in the past.

He didn't.  Also, he wants you to split his airfare costs?  Hell no.  He sees you and your husband as a piggy bank if he couldn't handle the score keeping (which is what he did when asking for reimbursement AFTER the fact).\n\nAlso, 5 years isn't \"a long time ago\".  That's still pretty fresh.\n\nMoral of the story for him:  Don't invite people to a vacation you can't afford.  If he wanted to split the cost he needed to communicate that upfront.", "NTA.  I was going to say ESH, but changed my mind the more I thought about why he didn\u2019t tell you he expect you and your husband to pay ahead of time. It seems to me he was basically trying to get you and your husband to subsidize his family\u2019s vacation. \n\nIt is interesting he just sent you an amount not actual invoices. I have been on many family vacation with my siblings, their spouses/SO, and their kids.  Basically if the vacation is to be a shared expense we decided where we are going to go together, decided if we are going to rent a house/houses together or each book our own rooms, and the dates of arrival. It is then up to everyone to book their flights/ or decide if they are going to drive based on financial reasons or closeness to the venue, and book their accommodation if we are not sharing a house. We do this bc some need more room, or want a more expensive/cheaper flight or hotel accommodations then others. The only time one person pays up front and others send cash to that person after the fact would be if we split renting a space. Even then we decide ahead of time how the expense will be split, by person, family, or bedroom. \n\nThey only time I have been on a vacation where I had no say or idea of the cost upfront was when I was not paying or expected to pay. Like when my brother took all of us to Ireland when he sold his business for big bucks. As a thank you for all the help we gave him when he first started out and he was struggling, he wanted to treat us to a vacation. Which seems like what you thought was going on here, and BIL did nothing to dispel that idea, in fact he actively encouraged it but not having one conversation about costs up front. Not discussing even the basics of what something is going to cost, what is the other parties budget/ limits is, is not something you do if you expect other people to pay. You don\u2019t wait till after the fact unless you are trying to pull something.\n\nHe didn\u2019t tell you ahead of time bc he DIDN\u2019T want you to book any of your flights/ accommodation separately, because if you did you would not be subsidizing his family\u2019s.  This was not an offer of a family vacation per say, but an offer of helping to subsidize a vacation he and his family otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been able to take.  \n\nYes, is was petty to bring up the help you freely offered to provide in the past, but I get the anger bc your BIL made what you thought was gesture of thanks for that help into an issue. I think you are not mad at being asked to pay, but bc you are recognizing that this trip was not planned as a way to bond as a family and enjoy each other\u2019s company, but that you were being used so BIL could go on vacation. Inviting you wasn\u2019t an act of love or appreciation, rather to get something from you.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't hold anything over anyone's head. Sam blindsided you with a bill that you never expected and changed it so you'd pay part of his expenses.", "So basically, BiL was using OP and her husband to subsidize their vacation, considering that he has a family of four, had more expensive airfares, and wants to split the costs down the middle. And he didn't say a word about it until afterwards. NTA. He's still a mooch.", "NTA. He invited you, and didn't mention anything about cost. However I feel you also should have asked. With that said the arbitrary number he plucked out the air (how convenient it came out to a nice round $1500) is ridiculous. \n\nHe wanted to manipulate you into paying, evidently forgetting that relying on your kindness and goodwill is why he has a home. Essentially he bit that hand that had fed him and when reminded of that he got upset.\n\nYour husband it seems is annoyed he had to listen to his brothers tantrum. Tell him it's his monkey and his circus but no money will be handed over to his ungrateful brother.", "NTA.  If they wanted you to pay that should have been mentioned before the trip.  And not the AH for bringing up receipts.", "NTA\n\nMostly for him thinking you should be splitting the cost of EVERYONES airfare 50/50. Depending on the age of his kids, that\u2019s 4 tickets for their family. If they\u2019re young enough to be lap sitters, they\u2019re still asking you to subsidize the higher cost of their airfare since their tickets were more expensive.\n\nWhat a mooch!!!!!", "INFO: just because it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a misunderstanding caused an argument. Have you asked your husband if he knew ahead of time they expected you pay?", "If you decide to pay, do so only after seeing receipts so that you're only paying for you and your husband.", "I wonder if they spent more than expected and are trying to recoup some of that with the \u201cbill\u201d.", "Nta I actually can\u2019t believe are saying YTA. Usually when people are splitting trips not only do they say something in advance but they also plan/book together. He needs to take this to the chin or take it out of what you guys have gave him so far. Like the audacity.

NTA", "NTA and no more financial help for him and his family.", "NTA\n\nPay half the accommodations and your travel to the cent.", "NTA, if you expect people to chip in, you tell them before the trip, not after.\n\nYou were petty, rubbing his debts into BIL face, but let's face it, he made the bed, he had to lie in it. He was the first one to point about accepting smth for granted.", "NTA.\n\n\"Give an inch, they take a mile\" comes to mind.", "I'm just going to say NTA.\n\nI question how someone would not discuss any sort of payment details for a vacation but it's clear he set you up because you might have said no otherwise and they wanted a vacation.\n\nit reminds me of my sister. she will violate every social more just because she knows the people in my family are non-confrontational and won't go after her.", "NTA. If you expect someone to pay for a trip, you let them know IN ADVANCE, so they:\n\n1) can see if they can afford it;\n\n2) have a say on hotel/accomodations/rooms;\n\n3) have a say in travel plans;\n\n4) have a say in where/when/how long, etc.\n\n5) have a say in what you decide to do while there.\n\nIf you're not the one paying, you may let some things go, but you wouldn't have known that ahead of time in this scenario. If I'm paying, I'm going to be much more picky. Maybe he didn't tell you because he didn't want you to have a say??", "INFO- Why did the brother talk to you about reimbursement and not his brother?  Seems kind of like he was looking for a fight going to you first.", "He absolutely should have mentioned splitting the bill when discussing this trip.  How do you even know the total and that you're not paying part of theirs?  Honestly, I would have done the same thing as you.  You're being called petty and cruel but he's not?   He thinks family doesn\u2019t mean you can take advantage of someone\u2019s kindness unless of course it's him.  Pay the bill and ask for the receipts (for tax purposes lol) I personally thought you played it well and made the point.  Any future plans should thoroughly discussed, so he doesn't overspend and charge you guys for it, because that's what I think he's doing.  NTA Some people just have a lot of nerve don't they?  Good luck!", "That's a helluva nerve he's got. Who invites someone on a vacation without telling them the cost first?\n\nAnd when he tried to shame you, you hit back with a giant dose of reality. And instead of being embarrassed as he should be, he went on the attack. Ungrateful, entitled asshole.\n\nNTA. Good for you.", "If my siblings said to us, \"Hey, we were thinking of going to Costa Rica next month. Why don't you two come along?\"  I would fully take that as an invitation to come along but everyone pays their own way.  \n\nIt would be different if they said, \"You and X were so kind to us when we needed help, that we would like to invite you along as our guests for a week in Costa Rica.\"\n\nUnless the trip was clearly offered to us as a gift, we would expect to pay.", "He didn't even ask you to cover yours and your husband's share of the vacation. Sounds like he asked you to pay for yourselves and subsidize some of their costs as well. And as you mentioned - he should have told you this upfront. He has no ground to demand money now, since you can't go back in time and either agree or not attend. \n\nThough I do think it was weird of you two to assume and not ask about the money situation ahead of time, I also think BIL is getting too used to spending your money and you were right to call him on it. Husband needs to stop enabling his brother.\n\nEdited for clarity. And actually, now that I think about this more, maybe it was bad communication on everyone's part. And maybe it's ESH. OP/husband shouldn't have assumed they were being paid for and BIL shouldn't have said nothing and billed them after the fact.", "ESH - leaning towards you being slightly more horrible.  He should have told you it was not on him.  You should not have assumed that it was on him.  I would never assume someone else was paying for my vacation even if they invited me on vacation.   Nor should you feel like someone owes you for something you did of your own free will.  If you help because you want to they owe you nothing.\n\nAlso, you seem to be assuming that $1500 is half or a larger share of the trip.  Are you sure that's the case?  \"closer\" doesn't necessarily equate to a lot cheaper.  I suspect there wasn't as much difference between airfares as you thought there was.  Before you jump to that assumption, ask for a copy of the bill so you can see.\n\n$1500 for two people with airfare to spend a week at a resort doesn't seem like you're paying more than you should be.  It may be that everyone got a better price by buying for 6 people on one card and that $1500 is the actual, likely rounded, cost for this.\n\nPay what it actually cost for you to go, chalk it up to miscommunication, and move on.", "NTA\n\nYou cant invite people somewhere and charge them after the fact.\n\nAnd if I was the husband, if be annoyed and hurt, I thought the trip was a thank-you for all out help in the past, to get a bill?!?!?!", "NTA\n\nIt seems like Sam is trying to get you to pay more than your share of the trip, and when you just didn't agree to, he went to a \"moral tangent\" he had no right to. \n\nI think you need to firmly discuss this with your husband and clear the air with him. Explain to him how his brothers \"families shouldn't take advantage of each other\" rubbed you the wrong way, and how him not making it clear from the start, that you'd have to pay,  also rubbed you the wrong way. And yes, Sam owes you a lot fir how much you have helped him, and he should show gratitude instead of shouting at you.", "Is there a reason you didn't ask about the finances of the trip at the beginning when asked? \n\nI think it's an ESH. \n\nI agree that they should have been upfront if they expected you to foot your share of the bill or contribute anything. And I think that his comment when you said no was super tone deaf of the help that you both offered him. Though it was a completely different situation from that. One was a necessity, one was leisure. \n\nYou also made that decision of your own free will to help. You don't help people, then hold it over their head when they've upset you. Also you knew where they were financially and what they've been through. The fact that you didn't verify feels like you almost were treating it as a thank you.\n\nThey should have said \"We want to do this, this is what this part costs we'd love to have you join us.\" When invited, you should have asked \"Okay, what's the budget situation?\" and covered it.", "NTA. Yes, you did everything you did financially of your own free will. Just like they invited you on a trip and paid for everything of their own free will. If they wanted this to be a split cost they should have brought it up to you guys as a question like hey should we take this trip and everybody pay their own way that would be totally different than taking you on a trip and then all of a sudden telling you you owe them money", "NTA. It\u2019s typically that if people are expected to pay that should be shared with them upfront. \n\nHowever, now you know they could not afford to take y\u2019all on this trip and are expecting to be paid back. While unfair you should pay then what you owe them. \n\nAsk for receipts of purchases made. Get the cost of your airfare, hotel, activities and food and pay for that. Moving forward you should be told what your expenses will be beforehand. It\u2019s up to you how you choose to handle this situation but I suggest that you hurt the hatchet\u2026this time. \n\n\u201cHello X, hubby and I have talked and I want to apologize for throwing our previous trips in your face.

I realize that this is not the case and I want to apologize again for my overreaction. \n\nMoving forward, I would appreciate if the costs associated with the trip are brought up before any Lyme to are made.

If you want to further chat about this I\u2019m definitely open to exploring how we can both improve.\u201d\n\nIf you want to be \u2018petty\u2019 you can stop paying their share moving forward.

If I'm inviting someone on vacation with us and expected them to pay their share I would have given them prices up front and let them know how much the lodging was and expect them to book their own fight if they lived in a different city from us. The only way I would have booked everything is if I had to secure the prices the same day or if I wanted to make sure rooms were next to each other; we were taking the same flights and sit together.", "ESH I am constantly amazed at the amount if people who don't have an upfront conversation about money and paying their way. My friend invites me to the cinema, I expect to pay for my ticket and ask how much I owe for the ticket. If I invite someone somewhere and expect them to pay their share I say, \"do you want to do xyz, it's \u00a350?\" So they know the cost and expectation to pay. Or I'd say \"my treat\" if it's nbd and I'm covering it. Sounds like your BIL has conveniently forgotten what you've done for him in the past but you also can't spring a $1500 bill on someone after the event. You know he doesn't have a lot of money and thought it odd he could afford a holiday for 6 and never thought to ask how much it'd cost you.", "This may be unpopular,  but ESH. I can't imagine a world where you'd automatically assume a *vacation* invite means someone will pay for you. Any other place, golfing, meals etc absolutely,  but most people can't spring for extra people on vacation.  You shouldn't have assumed.\n\nThat said,  if he can afford a vacation,  he can afford to pay you back.", "ESH - I can't imagine not talking about budget/finances when planning for a trip. Especially knowing the recent financial issues that BIL was in, how could you not have at least brought up the cost of the trip? Sure, he's an AH for waiting until after the trip to ask for money, but why would you go on a vacation without even asking about the costs?", "I'm going to go with an ESH, because although he didn't tell you that he wasn't planning on paying for your stay, you shouldn't have assumed that the invitation to come was them offering to pay for it. I suppose the wording of the invitation might help. Did they invite you to come with them on vacation, or did they offer to take you on vacation? For example, if my wife and I are going to see a movie, and I mention to another couple that they should come, I am assuming that they are going to pay for their tickets. If I tell the other couple that we are taking them to a movie, it is implied that I am paying for everything. So were you invited to the vacation, or were they taking you on a vacation? You acknowledge that your BIL is not completely out of the woods financially (still has some outstanding debts) so it seems like it would have been prudent to know for sure who was paying for what. Next time, you can throw something out like \"should we pay our share up front, or just pay you back after the vacation\" so that you know if you are paying or if they are.", "You and BIL are both AHs.  BIL obviously should have explicitly mentioned the cost sharing he envisioned before booking the trip.  Since it seems he didn't make it clear that he was planning on a contribution from you and your husband in advance, he obviously shouldn't requested reimbursement after.\n\nHowever, the entire post screams YTA.  Nothing about your hard work, personal finance skills, or career matters .  BIL's prior substance abuse, past money trouble, and small home are irrelevant to the issue of whether it was ok to request reimbursement when he had apparently invited you as guests.  Going through financial records and firing off a mean spirited text without discussing it with your husband 1st was out of line. A simple 'I wasn't expecting a bill as I thought you had invited us as guests. I need to talk to husband and then we'll get back to you' should've shamed BIL. It probably wouldn't have but at least your husband wouldn't think you were petty.", "I feel people may disagree but YTA.

I'd have done the exact same as you did", "Haha.. the BIL didnt like being called out after he was being an a$$hole. I bet he was surprised on how much you guys helped.

Neither of us was born into a particularly wealthy family, but we both prioritized learning to manage our finances and have invested a lot of effort into our careers. My husband\u2019s brother (I\u2019ll call him Sam) ended up in a tight situation 5 years ago, he had an alcohol problem to begin with, and then his GF accidentally got pregnant and they had twins to deal with - and they were barely managing to afford the rent on a 1 bedroom with a roommate. Plus student loan debt. \n\nMy husband wanted to help his brother, because his parents couldn\u2019t really afford to, and I was okay with it because we did have money to spare, and I really did feel for them. We supported them for almost a year - they lived with us, and once sam recovered from his addiction and they moved out, we still gave them significant financial help. Over the last few years, they\u2019ve been doing better and better - they have paid off most of their debt and own a small home. \n\nA few weeks ago, they invited us on vacation with them - I was happy to see the twins after so long, and my husband was happy to spend some time with his brother. It was a weeklong stay at a nice resort, and I was surprised and pleased that they\u2019d gone from no cash at all to being able to afford a holiday for 6 people. 2 days after we got home, Sam sent me a message saying that we should pay $1500 for our share of the trip. I was shocked, because they didn\u2019t say anything about us paying when they invited us. It also seemed strange that they\u2019d split the cost including both of our airfares, when my husband and I live much closer to the destination and had much lower airfare costs than Sam\u2019s family did. \n\nI wrote back saying that we would not be paying because we thought they were inviting us as family, and not as paying guests. I said they should have mentioned us paying our share before the trip if they wanted to. He wrote back quite angrily and said family is all very well, but family doesn\u2019t mean you can take advantage of someone\u2019s kindness. This rubbed me the wrong way, so I went through some of our old financial records and sent him an estimate of how much we\u2019d spent on his family over the years. I said if you don\u2019t want to take advantage of anyone\u2019s kindness, then please start paying us back for all this and we\u2019ll pay for the vacation. He didn\u2019t respond, but apparently called and yelled at my husband over the whole thing. \n\nMy husband thinks I was needlessly petty and that it was cruel of me to rub it in their faces that they needed help from us \u201ca long time ago\u201d. He says we should just pay and forget about it, because it\u2019s selfish of me to expect them to feel like they owe us for something we did of our own free will. And it\u2019s true that I would be less annoyed about them asking us to pay, if not for how much we helped them in the past. Am I the asshole for \u201cholding this over their head\u201d?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Bear in mind that this $1500 was for a week at a resort plus airfare for two people.  \n\nIf OP suspects subsidizing brother's trip then she should ask for receipts and approach this from a position of knowledge, not supposition.", "Agreed!", "Even if it was a good deal, which it probably isn't, I wouldn't want to go on a vacation completely planned by my screw-up BIL that I had no hand in planning.

If he'd said \"your half\" I'd understand the assumption more.", "The thing is, if this trip was meant to be a thank-you to OP and husband for their help in the past, then why would Sam have not SAID that to them at any point before or during the trip?  It doesn't do Sam any good to mean it that way, but never in fact say it. (Although, apparently it could have, as OP and husband just assumed that's what it was???)\n\nI would agree with others that the language used when inviting makes a big difference.  \"Hey, want to go out to dinner with us?\" (we're splitting the bill) versus, \"Hey, I want to take you out to dinner\" (I am paying for the people I'm inviting).  Same with vacations, only moreso.\n\nI don't think Sam is blameless here, FAR from it.  I think the way he did things was weird.  But I also think OP and husband's assumptions were weird.  I simply can't imagine my family (who I know very well have had financial difficulties for years) asking me to come with them on vacation, and not just immediately saying, \"oh yes, I'd love to -- how much is the hotel?\" and assuming that \\*I\\* would be buying my own tickets.  At that point, it would be up to Sam to say, Oh no, it's all on me!  \n\nBuuuut yeah, Sam also never saying anything to them during the entire process of arranging and paying for all this travel (including \\*their\\* tickets???), never mentioning it while they were there at the resort, and then only sending them a \"bill\" afterwards?  That, too, is supremely weird!  And rude!\n\n(Personally, though, I think that OP bringing up all the help they gave him and his family, was uncalled for.  OP and husband gave that help to them, as a matter of survival.  If you'd wanted to be paid back for it, again, that's a stipulation you make when giving the help. If not, it's a gift.  Sure, they gave Sam a lot of money.  But Sam still has a family to pay for and it does not sound like his family's wealth is anywhere near OP's and her husband's.  No, Sam shouldn't be taking advantage of \"well, you can afford it\", either.  But it rubs me wrong to help someone and never indicate I want to be paid back, only to use it against them later.)", "You see a lot of week long trips to a resort including return airfare for less than $750 per person?", "It wasn't previous trips.

But for an expensive vacation, one needs to be very clear on what\u2019s expected.

You invite them and say this is what we expect the rooms/etc.  to cost\u2026is that good for you.  And if he\u2019d just asked for reimbursement that\u2019s one thing, but once he said something about OP taking advantage of gave of family and got angry at her surprise, then I kind of understand the reaction from her.

I'm a little taken aback by the number of people who, it sounds like, regularly experience family or friends inviting them on a vacation that is all-expenses-paid by the inviters.  (Or at least, the only time that happens is when you're being invited to someone's house that they own; but even then, I'd expect to pay my own travel to get there!)\n\nThe only times I've experienced that with family are either when parents are paying for children (even adult children), or when it's a destination wedding and the family holding the wedding are paying for some of the close family's travel and lodging expenses.\n\nOtherwise, at least ASKING just seems reflexive.  \"Hey, we're renting this house on the beach for the week -- why don't you come join us?\" - \"Okay!  What do I owe you?\"  Their answer might be, \"oh, nothing, we'd just like your company!\" (in which case you arrange to at least treat them to dinner one of the nights, and stuff like that).  \n\nThe thing that really surprises me about this situation is that Sam must have made the travel arrangements on behalf of OP and husband, and paid for their tickets up front?

I asked OP for more info, as I don't quite get where she jumped from the word \"share\" to the assumption they meant \"half\". If he laid out the costs, or anything like that, it would make sense. But based on the info she shared, I don't quite get it.", "OK.  So then it is entirely possible that leaping to the conclusion that $1500 is half the price for a trip for six people is erroneous and, in fact, they were paying for \"their share\" as the BIL stated.", "Perhaps but then why wouldn\u2019t the inviting couple mention the cost, etc?", "My parents are probably upper middle class and would never have expected their siblings who are more middle class and have had more economic struggles to cover an all inclusive resort vacation for them. I don't think they would agree to let their siblings cover such a vacation for them even as a thank you for help, especially if the sibling was just starting to get their feet under them and had a young family. A nice dinner, sure, but not a full vacation. It seems odd that price wasn't discussed.", "There's no way it's 50/50, airfare and staying at a resort for a week for 6 people and it only comes out to $3k? \n\nOP and her husband got invited on a vacation that her bil planned and at no point during the entire week did they bring up how to pay them back?  Sure it wasn't smooth for him to just ask for it after the fact, but did they really think they're getting a free vacation from someone she even admitted she didn't think had that kind of cash to pay for it all?", "I wasn\u2019t sure but the last sentence of the third paragraph made me think that.  Maybe I am reading it wrong.", "Where I was getting that from and again I could be wrong. \n\n        It also seemed strange that they\u2019d split the cost including both our airfares, when my husband and I live much closer to the destination and had a much lower airfare costs than Sam\u2019s family did\u201d.\n\nSo either way it seems like they are trying to get OP to pay more than their fair share.  Otherwise why mention it.  Now that I keep rereading I\u2019m not sure quite what sure what they meant.", "Oh God, I forgot about that aspect.  I bet they did.", "That's messed up, inviter pays, if they invite themselves then they pay for themselves otherwise I have missed out on a load of free vacations", "Not if you'd been subsidizing the inviter for several years. They assumed it was payback for all they did for the BIL.", "But it wasn't their portion. It was also the cost of BIL's airfare. So even with your point, it still wouldn't be right.", "I would expect it to be free if the person inviting me didn't give me the cost/fees before scheduling the trip. Who invites someone on a vacation but don't give the invitees indications of what their share of the cost would be? You don't wait until after the vacation is over and then say \"Oh you owe me this much\". Especially when the invitor never gave the invitee the chance to see if that is a trip that they can afford.", "Nope. If you're splitting the costs you say \"it's $x a night\" up front and you arrange airfares separately.\n\nYou do not expect people you invited to subsidise your flights, and you do not bill people after the fact.", "That's a bad assumption. If cost sharing was expected it should most definitely have been mentioned when the invite was extended  after all if I'm going to be paying my own way wouldn't the cost of that be important to me in making my decision of whether to go or not ?", "Maybe we're just different then..I always thought it was the norm. We cover their vacation costs when we invite them on vacation.", "Nobody invites someone on a trip, never mentions any cost, and then tells them later that actually they owe this much. And in this case it's even more than their *actual* share...\n\nIf you invite me on a family ski trip and then later tell me I owe you 15k I might have just not gone on that ski trip.", " But was it an actual invitation ( Would you like to go with us to blah blah blah vacation? ) or was it more casual like hey, we should head up to bla bla bla in June)? Hard to say for sure.", "Nah, It\u2019s not a school trip or a family reunion. If you ask someone to come on vacation with you, you pay or you tell them they\u2019re paying. You don\u2019t invite them and then assume they\u2019ll pay their way to join you somewhere YOU asked them to be.", "I didn't assume the other side is paying???? I'm the one that does the inviting and paying.", "Yeah but I think in most cases if person B just said HELL YEAHHHH person A responds w \u201cit\u2019s $xxx per person\u201d. So I still think it\u2019s weird BIL never mentioned money upfront.", "Think this situation was different cause it OP and husband supported BIL family for least 2 years so it would seem weird that BIL would invite and treat OP to a vacation as a way say thank you for helping them out in the past.", "He also knows his brother helped him get out of an addiction situation and has never paid them back or apparently thanked them. So brother is the AH here.", "Well, I would expect it to be free if the person inviting me didn't give me the cost/fees before scheduling the trip.  Who invites someone on a vacation but don't give the invitees indications of what their share of the cost would be?  You don't wait until after the vacation is over and then say \"Oh you owe me this much\".  Especially when the invitor never gave the invitee the chance to see if that is a trip that they can afford.", "This isn't catching lunch with a buddy.  It's a full blown vacation. \n\nBut, actually?  Yes. It's pretty common in my friend group for the person that invites/picks the place to pay the whole tab.", "I feel like this is OPs BIL being deliberately obtuse just to scam them. I dunno about you, but whenever I've planned any vacation that requires splitting costs, that's like #2 on the list of conversations that must happen.\n\nGenerally, in my experiences - if that conversation never happens, it's because it's been taken care of somehow.", "Did you read about what OP gave?", "Agreed.  She seems to base her conclusion on their location being \"much closer\".  In my experience that doesn't make a huge difference in airfare costs and, depending on if \"much closer\" is also in an area with a smaller airport with no international flights it may actually be more money period.", "I see. And I agree, OP could be more clear. Maybe I shouldn't have, because I know how these posts go, but I just took her word for it that their share of the trip was unfair and more that what it would have cost them to pay on their own.", "Well assuming that each family paid for their own food, souvenirs, entrance fees and transportation while on the trip \n\nThe costs remaining would be hotel rooms and flight tickets \n\nNow assuming both rooms cost the same, that could be split in 50/50 fairly but when it comes to air fare is when it becomes unfair \n\nThe cost of 4 tickets would be double of what OP\u2019s 2 tickets costs and by splitting that 50/50 OP and her husband are now paying extra to subsidize BIL\u2019s airfare \n\nEven if that\u2019s not the case the costs of a family of 4 is going to be more than the costs of a family of 2 and splitting that 50/50 is not fair\n\nAdd the fact BIL told OP to not take advantage of a family\u2019s kindness after DEMANDING OP pay extra for the costs of BIL\u2019s family, after all OP and her husband did for BIL during his hardships is just spitting in their face\n\nThe gall of the BIL, the sheer entitlement is unreal\n\nThat is what makes me think this wasn\u2019t just a simple miscommunication. I feel BIL did this deliberately with bad intentions to use OP and her husband\u2019s generosity in order to get a subsidized vacation \n\nAnd when BIL doesn\u2019t get his way from OP, he immediately tried to guilt trip her, when that doesn\u2019t work, BIL calls OP\u2019s husband to berate and bully him into giving him extra money \n\nWhen BIL decides to not accept a simple miscommunication and double down is when he became the entitled AH\n\nThis is another case of self centered parents demanding childfree couples to subsidize their children", "Because Google exists.", "I think you're reading the OP words correctly, but I'm not as sure that those words aren't an assumption on her behalf based on the conversation as relayed.", "I'm aware of what she said, but she also said the BIL presented it as \"their share\".  From what I read she appears to be interpreting that as \"half the bill\" as opposed to knowing it's half the bill.", "Exactly as well as booking and paying for airfares and accommodation and not mentioning anything about splitting costs any normal person would think they are doing a nice thing.", "You'd think you'd sort out money before the holiday though?", "> So I still think it\u2019s weird BIL never mentioned money upfront.\n\nEXACTLY!!!  I have asked family and friends if they wanted to go vacation trips with me and if they seem interested, I ALWAYS tell them the cost of the trip ahead of time.  I mean, if you aren't paying for someone, then why wouldn't you give the invitees the costs/fees ahead of time?", "You just made me notice something else that makes OP an asshole. Sounds like they went this whole trip thinking they were getting an all paid for trip and never said thank you.\n\nI mean if they did the response would have been for what and cleared all this mess up", ">or apparently thanked them. \n\nBased on?", "So if someone invites you on a trip and they don't mention the price instead of asking \"hey how much\" you automatically assume it's free no further conversation needed?", "Hmmm strange. Over the years gotten 100s of invites by friends to go on trips dinner movies etc.  I never had to be told upfront I have to pay for myself. It's usually the other way around where if someone is paying they offer upfront. But hey guess we loved different lives", "Ditto about that being nearly the first thing you talk about.  Maybe after dates.  But often even before dates.  (Although, depending on the trip, dates can affect cost, so...)\n\nNot to be mean to BIL in a different way, but like... OP and husband know him even better than us, and from this write-up he doesn't impress me as the most... together person in the world.  So expecting him to organize a big group trip without hiccups is not something I'd just assume, to start with. I'd be asking for details.\n\nIn my experience, even if that conversation hasn't been started, I start it. In particular, when I know that this is coming from someone who has less disposable income than I do (jobs, family situation, lack of savings, etc.), then I doubly ask up front and would NEVER think \"it's been taken care of\" in regards a big ticket item like a vacation. (A dinner?  Sure.  A week-long resort vacation?  Hell no.)\n\nI do get that it can take time and experience to learn that it saves headaches and hurt feelings all around if you just make sure to work all this stuff out beforehand.  For a lot of people, sometimes it takes the hurt feelings and \"lesson learned\" to make sure to do it the next time.\n\nEventually, you do learn that if someone invites you somewhere and doesn't lead with \"it's on me\", you ask, and then they can SAY \"it's on me\" if that's the case.\n\n(I've also never experienced a case in which someone was offering a dinner or a trip or a gift as a thank-you, without them saying, \\*at some point\\*, \"this is to thank you for --\"  So that was a huge assumption on OP's part, too.)", "That's the problem.  OP is acting the same way that she's complaining about Sam acting, here.\n\nGoing by what OP has said, AT NO POINT during the time period when she and her husband were helping Sam and his family financially, did she or her husband EVER say, \"this is all a loan, by the way; you don't have to pay us back right away, but you should plan to pay us back gradually, once you're able to\".\n\nThat being the case, then, their helping Sam was a gift.  Not a tit-for-tat.  \n\nMaybe Sam or his wife should have, at some point during that entire period of time, brought this up with OP and husband.  But it's still true that if you are giving someone financial help, you either make repayment plans clear, or you view it as a gift.\n\nFast forward to now, and OP knows better than anyone that while Sam and his family may be doing better now, they aren't as wealthy as OP and her husband.  Gifting a vacation is an extravagant gesture.  It's not one that you'd expect someone like that to be able to make.\n\nI do think Sam is partly at fault here for not making it much clearer to OP and husband that he expected them to pay their way. (Or, some of their way.  Why on earth would he have bought their plane tickets \\*for them\\*?  That's nuts.)\n\nBut I find OP's assumptions weirdly naive.    And, going on a vacation is not at all the same thing as helping members of your family survive when they are destitute.", "I don't really care anymore about this post truthfully. So let's agree to disagree", "I almost always vote info first on these posts. If anything seems unclear, I assume it's to make them look better.. And it usually is!  \n\nI'm curious about how they were invited on the holiday too. \"We're going to X for a week, do you guys want to come too?\" is very different than \"We'd like to take you on holiday\".", "Where are you getting that flights are being split 50/50? If $750 is a good deal for flights and a week stay, then why is there the assumption that BIL only paid $1500 too. I haven't seen anything that actually says the total cost was only $3,000. $500 per person for lodging and transportation would be a really good deal for most resort vacations.", "Because it\u2019s written in the post \n\n\u2018 It also seemed strange that they\u2019d split the cost including both of our airfares, when my husband and I live much closer to the destination and had much lower airfare costs than Sam\u2019s family did.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s the 3rd paragraph from the bottom", "That doesn't actually say it is split 50/50. The OP hasn't been very clear on the split and as far as I have seen hasn't answered questions about the total cost."]}
