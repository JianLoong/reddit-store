This was pretty early in the reception and there was no way to get it out, so the night was ruined for her and Taylor struggled greatly to move past this. \n\nObviously Ken was thrown out of the venue, and we did bring him to court for the damage. He opted to just pay without going through with the court date and has flat out admitted he did it on purpose. His reasoning was he had a thing for my mom, was wasted, and thought that would impress her. Apparently my mom unbeknownst to us was angry because Taylor told people we were engaged at my mom's milestone birthday party and my mom told Ken that, and he got this brilliant idea to woo her.\n\nAnyway my mom initially sided with us, but later began dating Ken and told us to get over it. I told her it was us or him and she picked him. I lost my mom and both of my sisters over this guy, and Taylor lost out on her dream wedding. I haven't seen my mom since but I did know through family that she and Ken were getting married. I tried to keep this from Taylor as it would hurt her, but she found out.\n\nRecently my cousin \"Emily\" came over. Emily is the only family I have left due to Ken so I do value the relationship. Emily mentioned how she had spent the weekend in a nearby vacation town for my mom's wedding and was just saying how much she liked the town, but Taylor snapped at her and said she didn't want to hear anything about my mom's wedding.\n\nEmily said she understood. About twenty minutes later Taylor asked if she wanted to stay for dinner and Emily said she couldn't as she has my mom's dogs at the moment (so obviously she is on her honeymoon) Taylor lost it and said emily can't be this stupid and must be trying to hurt her for some reason. She began to get emotional and said that her wedding was stolen and she doesn't want to hear anything about my mom being happy or having a wedding.\n\nI gave her a hug and tried to calm her down. she told me to make Emily leave and I said that didn't seem fair as it was probably a mistake. Emily said she said not to talk about the wedding and she didn't realize she couldn't even talk about the dogs. Taylor asked if I was really going to not do anything and I said I didn't feel right kicking Emily out.

Whether Emily was just oblivious or just trying to \"help\" reestablish relationships - I do not know but she clearly missed the cues.\n\n2) Ken - biggest AH of them all \n\n3) Taylor - sure having her dress wrecked sucks bigtime but it did not have to destroy her dream wedding and still being traumatized by it is well, unhealthy and somewhat obsessive.  That is the thing about life, crap happens intentionally and unintentionally and you have to be able to deal with it.  She never has to like Ken but if hearing about your Mom sets her off like that, she needs therapy.  Taylor also sucks for announcing the engagement at your Mom's special day.\n\n4) You - NTA for not kicking Emily out.

After this time Judgement Bot goes in, looks for the top comment on the post and, assuming there\u2019s only one judgement in that comment, assigns the respective flair to the post and assigns the commenter a flair point.\r  \n\r  \nWhat if there\u2019s more than one judgement in the top comment? In this case, Judgement Bot reports the post to the mods so it appears in our queue, with a \u2018manual judgement needed\u2019 reason. We then go in with our human eyes and determine what the judgement was supposed to be. This usually happens with comments that say something like \u201cI thought YTA from the title but now reading the post I\u2019m going with NTA.\u201d", "You don\u2019t get to decide if someone suffered trauma or not.

Yes, it was messed up, cruel & all of that but she is making this so much more than it has to be. Just to victimize herself more than she was. So what if she had stains on her gown, she just married the man of her dreams! So what if someone was an ass, you move on, you dont let it consume you. Yet you have literally disowned your mom over this. Your mom. Who wasnt in on it. She didnt have anything to do with it. And you/your wife want your mom to give up her \"love of her life\"& because she wont, she cant even be mentioned? Im not sticking up for ken, what he did was beyond f'ed up, but your mom didnt do it & you are punishing her anyways.

OP has done everything in his power to protect/defend her at the expense of his relationship with his entire family. \n\nIt's not fair to expect a completely innocent person to walk on eggshells because of a vendetta you have with their family.

Affect your holidays, all relationships with your inlaws? Make you miserable at the sound of a name?  Sucking the joy out of future events?  \n\nBad things happen, and they suck.  Bad things happen at events we dream of and that sucks even more.

Taylor doesn't come off looking good here, but mom looks worse and Ken should have gone to jail and paid fines/legal fees/cost of replacement.  Should Taylor have gone to jail for what she did?

If you\u2019d been able to express that instead of blindsiding them with it at the crucial moment, you could have healed from the incident before they got married, and you\u2019d still have a son to enjoy. Hell you could have even enjoyed your son\u2019s wedding, maybe even learned to love your DIL. I\u2019m not saying your DIL didn\u2019t fuck up by making your birthday about her (accidentally or not), but you are not taking accountability for your own inaction here. You not saying something before the wedding absolutely puts you in the wrong. And then you basically married an asshole because he does the emotional work you\u2019ve refused to do for years, instead of standing up for your own needs all this time. Relationships of any kind are hard. They require work, and that is work you\u2019ve been avoiding for your own comfort. People are always going to make mistakes, which means you are always going to have to give and receive difficult words to keep the relationship going. For the people who haven\u2019t cut you off\u2019s sake, please go to therapy and learn how to have those conversations.", "And I can *never* be upset if my child announces an engagement at my birthday.

Anyone with a bit of common sense knows it's generally seen as a dick move to hijack someone else's event like that. But if it just came up in conversation?

In some of the comments you seem so sympathetic to her about devoting her life to others (including yourself), but here you seem to think that she should continue to devote her life and it\u2019s purpose to you, a grown adult with a wife of his own. And controlling your mother\u2019s choices when she seems genuinely happy is not about love. And attributing blame to her about the actions of her other two adult children. You are a grown man still blaming everything on mommy, and in such a bitter way. Think about what kind of karma that will generate in your own life.", "Abandoned her kid?

I mean, you monitor your physical health once a year, how much better would we all be if we have that much attention and care to our mental health. \n\nIf seeing a therapist were as common as going to the doctor or dentist, a lot less people would be suffering, many less suicides. We could have earlier treatment for depression. Etc.", "It\u2019s not a big deal for exactly that reason. It wasn\u2019t a fucking quince\u00f1era.
