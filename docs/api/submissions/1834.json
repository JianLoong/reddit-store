This was pretty early in the reception and there was no way to get it out, so the night was ruined for her and Taylor struggled greatly to move past this. \n\nObviously Ken was thrown out of the venue, and we did bring him to court for the damage. He opted to just pay without going through with the court date and has flat out admitted he did it on purpose. His reasoning was he had a thing for my mom, was wasted, and thought that would impress her. Apparently my mom unbeknownst to us was angry because Taylor told people we were engaged at my mom's milestone birthday party and my mom told Ken that, and he got this brilliant idea to woo her.\n\nAnyway my mom initially sided with us, but later began dating Ken and told us to get over it. I told her it was us or him and she picked him. I lost my mom and both of my sisters over this guy, and Taylor lost out on her dream wedding. I haven't seen my mom since but I did know through family that she and Ken were getting married. I tried to keep this from Taylor as it would hurt her, but she found out.\n\nRecently my cousin \"Emily\" came over. Emily is the only family I have left due to Ken so I do value the relationship. Emily mentioned how she had spent the weekend in a nearby vacation town for my mom's wedding and was just saying how much she liked the town, but Taylor snapped at her and said she didn't want to hear anything about my mom's wedding.\n\nEmily said she understood. About twenty minutes later Taylor asked if she wanted to stay for dinner and Emily said she couldn't as she has my mom's dogs at the moment (so obviously she is on her honeymoon) Taylor lost it and said emily can't be this stupid and must be trying to hurt her for some reason. She began to get emotional and said that her wedding was stolen and she doesn't want to hear anything about my mom being happy or having a wedding.\n\nI gave her a hug and tried to calm her down. she told me to make Emily leave and I said that didn't seem fair as it was probably a mistake. Emily said she said not to talk about the wedding and she didn't realize she couldn't even talk about the dogs.

Whether Emily was just oblivious or just trying to \"help\" reestablish relationships - I do not know but she clearly missed the cues.\n\n2) Ken - biggest AH of them all \n\n3) Taylor - sure having her dress wrecked sucks bigtime but it did not have to destroy her dream wedding and still being traumatized by it is well, unhealthy and somewhat obsessive.  That is the thing about life, crap happens intentionally and unintentionally and you have to be able to deal with it.  She never has to like Ken but if hearing about your Mom sets her off like that, she needs therapy.  Taylor also sucks for announcing the engagement at your Mom's special day.\n\n4) You - NTA for not kicking Emily out.

I will keep it in mind for next reply.\n\nFrom : [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vozn9i/aita\\_monthly\\_open\\_forum\\_july\\_2022/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vozn9i/aita_monthly_open_forum_july_2022/)\n\nJudgement Bot\u2019s primary purpose has always been to assign judgement to a post after enough time has passed for the community to weigh in. Currently that timeframe is eighteen hours. After this time Judgement Bot goes in, looks for the top comment on the post and, assuming there\u2019s only one judgement in that comment, assigns the respective flair to the post and assigns the commenter a flair point.\r  \n\r  \nWhat if there\u2019s more than one judgement in the top comment? In this case, Judgement Bot reports the post to the mods so it appears in our queue, with a \u2018manual judgement needed\u2019 reason. We then go in with our human eyes and determine what the judgement was supposed to be. This usually happens with comments that say something like \u201cI thought YTA from the title but now reading the post I\u2019m going with NTA.\u201d", "You don\u2019t get to decide if someone suffered trauma or not. That\u2019s not your lane. She\u2019s exhibiting signs of it and definitely needs therapy. \n\nBeyond that tho, she\u2019s getting emotional, it\u2019s time for company to leave regardless of why.", "She was an asshole for making an announcement at OP\u2019s mom\u2019s birthday. She was an asshole for calling OP\u2019s cousin stupid and going off on her for mentioning the dogs.", ">\tAlso you mom is evil. To ruin someone\u2019s big day due to something so petty, is messed up\n\nWhat did his mom do that ruined the big day?", ">\tMentioning to one or two people when most people already know \n\nWhere did OP say that that is exactly what happened? Or did you just make that part up?", "LMAO. Wrong. A reasonable person can determine what is trauma or not. A hysterical drama llama like OP\u2019s wife will exhibit behaviors like that over absolutely nothing.\n\nSo she throws a tantrum, he makes his only remaining family leave, and she gets to continue to isolate him from his family. That\u2019s her being manipulative, not signs of tRaUmA.", "\u201cMaking an announcement\u201d \ud83d\ude44\n\nJudging by your other comments\u2026 Ken?", "Where did op say they made a big formal announcement that stopped the whole party in its tracks", "Where did I say that\u2019s exactly what happened? You are the one who made up some fantasy version of what happened and tried to pass it off as fact.", "Ok what exactly do you think happened"]}
