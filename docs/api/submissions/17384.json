We're currently 7 months pregnant with our second child, a daughter. My parents have I have a strained relationship for over 20 years dating back to my teens.  \n\nDuring our first pregnancy, we told my parents some things in confidence, including the gender which we were not ready to reveal. Both times, they announced our news on Facebook immediately, and robbed us of the chance to have a gender reveal at our baby shower.  \n\nWhen we found out we were expecting again, I suggested we don't tell my parents (who live a 5 hour drive away) until we are ready to announce it ourselves, to not have our news announced again by someone else. That time came past last weekend, on Mother's Day. On Sunday I let them know we are expecting our second child to be born this summer. The response from them was \"I'm hurt that you're just telling us now.\" I didn't want to bring up old wounds, so I just said we wanted to keep this news special to ourselves for a while. They pressed why we wouldn't tell them earlier and I responded I didn't feel I needed to justify our decision.  \n\nShortly after the call ended my Dad messaged the group chat (My wife, myself, and my parents) to ask again what is the reason we didn't tell them earlier. Finally I said, it's because the things we told you during our last pregnancy all ended up on Facebook before we had a chance to announce them.  \n\nMy Grandmother passed away suddenly last month. My dad's response to me was \"It would have been nice to tell grandma before she died.\" I was shocked, but simply reiterated I don't need to justify our decision and I appreciate his understanding. He responded \"Sorry I don't\".  \n\nYesterday we didn't talk, then at 7am this morning today he messaged group chat \"How a man treats his mother tells you everything you need to know.\"  \n\nI lost it. I replied immediately \"This ends now, answer your phone\". I phoned him 4 times and he didn't answer, so I replied in the chat and I went off on him.  \n\n\"Fuck you for what you've said the last 36 hours. You have no right to guilt me about grandma or mom. I treated mom with respect. I did nothing wrong.\"  \n\nI further called him a callous prick, told him if he wanted to repeat his father's mistake of psychologically abusing his children he can pick one of my siblings to victimize instead and that I'm not going to relive the trauma he's still working through. I told him his deceased mother would turn over in her grave if she knew he was using her as a tool to guilt me. I told him if they want to know my life updates earlier then stop announcing them on Facebook. I told him when he's ready to meet his granddaughter he can apologize to both my wife and myself, and it better be a real good apology because I've never met a bigger asshole than he has been for the last 36 hours.  \n\nSo, Reddit, I need to know.

Your parents are appallingly self-centered and in your father's case just downright nasty. You lost your temper. So what?  You were subjected to repeated and escalating provocations culminating in his unforgivable remark about your grandmother. Sometimes it necessary to loose it and give your abuser an honest angry dose of the truth.  Stick to your guns with them about the apology. And congratulations on the coming LO.", "NTA, definitely NTA, you had justified reasoning for not telling him.\n\nAdditionally, there is no way you could have know your grandma was going to pass. \n\nYour father is being a child.", "NTA\n\nMy lady didn't tell her grandma she was pregnant for quite some time, even though we were long past the age or relationship length where it would be expected. This confused me, until we told them and her first reaction was to ask when we were due.\n\n\"April\"\n\n\"Ugh. Tax season.\"\n\nThen proceeded to offer her 27 year old grand daughter alcohol for the first time in her life.\n\nFamily is WEIRD. And we know our family better than anyone. I don't blame you for doing what made you and your pregnant partner more comfortable.", "NTA\n\nIt needed saying.\n\nAnd always remember: the person who controls access to the grandchildren holds all the cards. And that's you.", "NTA. You trusted them before, and they managed to fall at literally the first hurdle. It's reasonable that you don't want to make the same mistake again.\n\nYou also stood up for yourself and your family against your father's attempts at manipulation.", "NTA they've already proven to you that they can't be trusted. If you'd told them you were pregnant they would have been harassing you for more information. Good on you for taking a stance against your father's treatment.", "NTA. This news (congrats BTW) is for you and your wife and child. You share it how you guys see fit. They\u2019ve already shown they won\u2019t respect your request to keep news like this private by blasting it on FB. \nNow, although I firmly believe you\u2019re NTA for this behavior, you do have to recognize the more nuanced aspects of these interactions and the consequences thereof. Your choice to make, but you should ask yourself in this situation whether the reward (sharing gender yourself) outweighs the risk (your parents being upset and shitty towards you as a result). The cat is out of the bag on this one. Just for the future. And yes, it sucks ass that you\u2019re being put in this situation of having to choose between those options. \nFor now, fuck em. Go enjoy your kid/soon to be kids and just remember all this when they\u2019re older!", "NTA, What you are doing sounds perfectly justifiable.\n\nI play middle man between my step-brother and my step-mother for that same reason. He knows the stuff he says is between us, and the stuff he tells her gets twisted and sometimes used against him. Now she gets to hear zero about the stuff in his life and I get to share in all the news (New jobs, fianc\u00e9, the good/bad, etc.).", "The people who take priority in knowing about the pregnancy are: the pregnant woman herself, and the father of her child. No one else.\n\nAnd your father is a piece of work, by the way.

We ended up reconciling the marriage, and three years later she still doesn't know we're together, because I can't trust her. So please keep my bias in mind.\n\nNTA. If they can't keep your secrets, they don't deserve to know them. They disrespected you and your wishes, and actions have consequences. Their info-time-out is well deserved, IMHO. Your dad using your deceased grandmother to guilt you is a real shitty move.", "NTA, if he doesn't get it he never will and using the death of his own mother against you is just gross.", "NTA holy cow how selfish can you get!?\n\nMy sister is getting married and when she was getting her dress I didn't even send the pics I took (for her reference later) to my long-term boyfriend because I didn't want the images somehow getting out and risk the groom accidentally seeing them\n\nI can't imagine ruining a pregnancy announcement or a gender reveal\n\n*And they doubled down!?!?!?*  \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.  He needed to hear it.  I would be careful about letting your children spend any time with them without you in the future.   Keep them away from that psychological abuse.", "NTA. But I doubt that your reaction is just bc of what your dad has said/done this week or the first pregnancy. It sounds like you have some underlying anger towards your dad and maybe your family in general. That anger could be justified or not, all you said was a strained relationship for 20 years. Regardless, it sounds like you need to unpack that with some support, likely a therapist.", "NTA I\u2019m currently pregnant with our second and I have  chosen not to tell anyone as of yet. Some have figured it out but they know to keep it quiet. I\u2019m due in October and we\u2019ll tell his parents sometime in August. Last pregnancy my MIL made many aspects of my pregnancy and even the birth all about her. My husband didn\u2019t help any either because he consistently texted updates to them after each appointment. This time I\u2019ve chose to just enjoy the quiet and enjoy my pregnancy. No texting anyone after appointments and keeping my healthcare to myself. I had a rough pregnancy with my first and the added crap from my MIL did not help. I\u2019ve also chosen no visitors for this go around as well. I had an emergency C-section late at night and didn\u2019t get to my room until 3am. They showed up at 7 to see their grandchild. No text, no phone call just a knock on the door at 7. And then they pretty much ended up coming and going as they pleased that first day. She tried to take credit for my child calling him hers and \u201cmy boy\u201d. I just had major surgery and was adjusting to being a new mother. I had my husband ask them not to come back and we would let them know when we were ready to accept visitors. Keep sticking to your boundaries and enjoy your growing family.", "The only asshole part is if you haven't already blocked him.  He doesn't deserve any more of your time or attention.  Block him on all forms of communication.  NTA", "NTA You are the kind of father I wish I had had, instead of the weak doormat who let his family walk all over him. I think some people will see this as an overreaction on your part but I completely understand. When people trample your boundaries and don't show any remorse resentment builds up!", "NTA, and they have asshole amnesia. Like, remember everything you did against our wishes, yea, that\u2019s why you don\u2019t get to know things now. Such an obvious cause and effect- way to go standing up to them, OP. It must be incredibly difficult however they sound downright delusional and completely self centred. Not everyone you lose is a loss!", "NTA. I, too, have a dad that loves to say wise-sounding bullshit with a lot of subtext criticizing my life choices. Ever since I started living on my own, I've learned over the years to stop responding when he behaves this way via text.", "NTA. I could have written this. We have similar families but I\u2019m a lot older. This type of behavior doesn\u2019t end with baby announcements. Every big family moment will be ruined by their need to be center stage instead of you or your children. Think school events, graduations, birthdays. It has been hard for me to even anticipate the drama so good for you for recognizing it early. Be strong!", "NTA. I didn\u2019t tell my mom I had a child until he was 3 yo. Strained relationships are strained for a reason.", "NTA - You had a perfectly legitimate reason for keeping this info from them for so long (not that you needed a reason). Instead of being happy for you when you finally shared the news OR showing remorse that their prior behavior resulted in your not feeling comfortable sharing this time, they chose to ruin (yet again) a moment that is supposed to be nothing but happiness for you and your wife. I\u2019m sorry your parents are such self-centered AHs.", "NTA  However, it might have been better to say \"We didn't tell you because we cannot trust you.\"", "NTA. Mad respect for this actually. I rarely call family out when they deserve it, just quietly distance myself. Good for you!!!", "NTA AT ALL!!! Your parents, particularly your dad, sound like narcissistic assholes.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to be nice about it, but they wouldn't let it go. He didn't answer the phone, so it was explained in the group chat.\n\nI would've said they're lucky to know before the baby was born.", "You are NOT the asshole in any way, shape, or form. Your dad is the fucking asshole and sounds exactly like mine. Fuck him and his controlling mindset. He\u2019s a manipulator and I\u2019m glad you\u2019re seeing past it. You see him for who he is. Stick to your guns and do not let him get what he wants. He doesn\u2019t deserve it.", "NTA. It shouldn't have escalated but you were provoked repeatedly, the final nail being what he said about your Grandmother. I don't know what your relationship was like but that feels like a critical hit across the board. \n\nYou don't owe them this information. It's fair for couples to want to keep that between themselves until later in the pregnancy. They just need to suck it up.", "NTA. But unfortunately, this is unlikely to make your dad change his behavior. I\u2019d be seriously thinking about whether I wanted someone like that to be present in my children\u2019s lives.", "NTA they spoiled the news of the first pregnancies and now they\u2019re in an \u201cinfo diet\u201d. They don\u2019t get to know anything until you and your wife are ready to share it. You set a boundary and they don\u2019t like it, that\u2019s their problem. They\u2019re only ensuring you won\u2019t want to share any more info with them and may no want them around for a while.", "NTA.  You've handled this the same way I would have.  Good on you for standing your ground.", "NTA. People can only disrespect you if you let them. Your parents didn't do the right thing when they had the chance, so you removed the possibility of them disrespecting you again. You handled it well, and your text message to him was firm, but he probably needed to hear that. He was absolutely being a bully with the messages he sent you. If he believes in the afterlife, then he must believe that your grandmother knows your heart and knows about your daughter. Your parents are toxic. I'm sorry they aren't more supportive, but don't let them ruin this joyful time for you and your wife.", "NTA\n\nAnyone can snap, it just depends on whose the one that broke it", "NTA. F\u2014- those b\u2014\u2014s man. Live y\u2019all\u2019s life. They can come in when they\u2019ve apologized\u2026good and hard.", "NTA. I can't believe he involved her parents in a group chat.

Nice boundary. Keep them up", "Nta.  You were actually pretty restrained.", "NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. You dropped the hammer and mic, well done.", "NTA. Wow, I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you.. The manipulation that you\u2019re being drenched in is appalling. I applaud you for trying to call them and make it right, but I think now is the time to just distance yourself and take care of your immediate family. \n\nSending good vibes to you and your little fam!", "NTA\nHaving a child is special and in such, is your special moment to share with everyone when you're ready. If my parents ever did that they wouldn't get to know either. I get they're also excited but it's not their baby and it's not their information to announce. They should have waited until you told everyone before posting about it everywhere. And then for them to not even acknowledge that doing that hurt you, that's just messed up. You had every right to blow up on them.", "Harsh but fair. NTA", "Nope NTA!", "NTA. My husband and I can\u2019t have children. But while we were going through IVF, we decided that any pregnancies would be just between us (except my daughter is a huge blabbermouth so who knows if that would have actually worked) until after the birth. Would his family have been hurt? Probably. But that\u2019s their issue. My extended family (parents are dead) would have been happy for us, after the initial confusion lol.", "NTA but not telling your grandma was an AH move (only if you were close with her).", "NTA but did your dad eat lead paint as a child? Something is seriously wrong with him", "Nope!", "NTA. That's your news and maybe if they kept their mouth shut they would have been able to know about it the second time around. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. And you chose not to get fooled. As for the grandma, If she was about to pass away and she knew it, i feel like that would be a sad thing to tell her because she knows she's gonna die and not be able to see the baby. So probably a good thing that you didn't tell her. I know if I was on my desk bed. I wouldn't want to hear about the future that i'm gonna miss.", "NTA.  Your father needed to hear those words so that maybe he can do some self-reflection.", "NTA. They're using emotional manipulation to make you feel bad. Don't let them.

It's your baby, you are not obligated to tell *anyone* else about it.", "NTA - They have broken your trust before and deserved nothing. Now, his recent behavior puts him square in the AH range. You rightly went after him with both barrels blazing and handled it perfectly. \n\nI went non-contact with my father 20 years ago for how he was treating people and do not regret it.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nYour parents are selfish.", "NTA.", "NTA. It is your decision when to tell people about the pregnancy, if ever. For your own mental health as well as your wife's, you may want to keep your distance from your family. They are toxic.", "NTA.  My mother and I get along, but she overshares so I never tell her anything until the thing is done or close to be done.  Seven months sounds about right, but your parents sound a lot worse than my mom", "NTA", "F no, NTA. I literally said out loud after they kept pressing it over texts \u2018let it freaking go!\u2019 after he was looking for a fight. Life\u2019s too short to deal with this nonsense, you handled it masterfully.", "NTA - summed it up pretty perfectly. They should be happy you\u2019re even in their life still", "NTA- and HELL YEA! I am so proud of you standing up for yourself and your wife! Yea buddy!", "NTA. Your children, your decision on who knows what and how much an individual is involved with them. Parents seem to be obnoxious, self entitled assholes and they AREN'T entitled to a damn thing. You stood up for yourself and put your foot down. If they can't respect boundaries, then that's on them.", "NTA. The rant was deserved and overdue. Although it would have been hilarious to just say \"You don't know the reason? Oh, wow, thanks for letting us know. We'll take it into consideration.\" And just keep repeating ad nauseum: \"Thank for letting us know that you feel that you did nothing wrong. We'll take it into consideration.\" It will drive them crazy, and the funny thing is you're not even bullshitting them, every time you decide *not* to tell them something you're taking them into consideration.", "NTA - Good on you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. This makes me so thankful for my\nAlways supportive parents because, damn, your parents are exhausting. Ugh.

But i always review myself after tense situations like these and if I had said that, I would have told myself next time to reword that, so as to avoid potential pitfalls that they might latch onto I\u2019m the next fight.   \n\nThe pitfalls being \u2018once you\u2019ve won the argument based on facts, they tend to target your tone, timing, and any \u2018manipulation\u2019 used to discredit your whole stance\u2019\n\nI\u2019ve found that people who constantly push your boundaries and discredit what you want/need are used to getting their way.

And then using that loud response as the proof of you being wrong.   \n\nSo while you\u2019re not the asshole in this situation, I\u2019d give you the same advice that I give myself.  Never be sincere with the continuously insincere.

OP, stick to your guns and be ready to not have them in your life at all.  in my experience, parents of adult children do not apologize and do not admit wrongdoing.  they wait, assuming you'll get over it, and act like nothing happened.  if they don't understand boundaries and respond to the imposition of a boundary by trying to guilt and shame you, they're not worth having in your life and they're not worth your kids being upset down the road by their behavior.", "*lose, not \"loose.\"", "[removed]", ">repeated and escalating provocations\n\nFrom the OP, his dad said, \"I'm hurt\", \"I don't understand\", and \"it'd be nice to have told grandma\".\n\nIf that's your idea of repeated and escalated provocations, I'm glad you're not in charge of the nuclear arsenal.\n\nI'd say ESH.

I don\u2019t really believe OPs story. There\u2019s no way in hell they didn\u2019t announce this pregnancy to everyone *except* his parents by this point.
