It honestly came across as a little condescending. \n\nWhile I do believe that everyone knows the right thing for their relationship- I\u2019ve always found this particular \u201cboundary\u201dto feel a little absurd to me.

Whenever a post mentions their partner being friends with the opposite sex, everyone immediately says they\u2019re cheating and that the OP should get a divorce.", "If her boyfriend is the one who demands that rule for them I also guarantee he doesn\u2019t follow it behind her back.", "She doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to talk about sexuality but somehow it\u2019s ok for her to talk about her boyfriend, which, uh, is discussing sexuality? \n\nI imagine she is a person who thinks being straight is \u201cnormal\u201d therefore referencing it is also normal, whereas referencing a same-sex relationship - at the same level of appropriateness as a straight relationship - is somehow \u201cdifferent\u201d.", "Your options are either cheaters or insecure as all hell.\n\nI can't possibly fathom being in a relationship with someone if you can't even trust them on a basic level not to fuck someone else if left alone with them.", "My husband loves to.rub in the food too. He's an ass. LEFT OVER COLD LUMPIA IS SHIT. Take.your break and bring it to me while it's still hot!", "She made that bed of worms and now she has to drink it!", "Cryptocurrency in a nutshell.", "I mean, they are usually doing something weird/dodgy outside the normal range of friendship \ud83d\ude02", "Bingo!", "It's bias though because people who have/whose partner has perfectly normal platonic friendships aren't having drama around it in their relationships. If the person posting here didn't already connect the drama to the \"friend\" at least enough to mention the friend I don't think Redditors would pick it up either", "The posts are almost never about the friendship and almost always about some lie, half-truth, or tactful omission. It\u2019s super funny to me that people will say \u201cwell that would be fine in my relationship\u201d while ignoring that there was deception. \n\nI have the same injury as one of my male friends. The best way to relieve the pain involves jamming a finger into the nerves of your butt. We do this for each other when we are hanging out and having a flare up, and my husband is very on board with this. (It is super painful and it makes my husband uncomfortable to cause me pain.) It WOULD be pretty weird if my husband wasn\u2019t aware of me and a friend playing grab ass and making each other scream."]}
