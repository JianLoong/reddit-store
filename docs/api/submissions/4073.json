And I told her in turn about a trip that I had planned with my best guy friend \u201cMatt\u201d, and I said my \u201cpartner\u201d couldn\u2019t get work off to join.

It honestly came across as a little condescending. \n\nWhile I do believe that everyone knows the right thing for their relationship- I\u2019ve always found this particular \u201cboundary\u201dto feel a little absurd to me.

I tried to change the subject and move on but she started to look more angry than embarrassed. She basically said it was uncalled for to make fun of and insult her relationship and that I set her up for failure by not telling her I was bisexual until that moment. Then she had the nerve to say \u201cto be honest, I don\u2019t really think the workplace is somewhere to be discussing sexuality at all.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything after that, and walked away - embarrassed too.\n\nI feel conflicted about the whole exchange.

That will shoot HR in the foot and backfire on her", "NTA and everyone who is saying YTA are idiots", "NTA\n\nI can't believe she went to HR about that.  I guess she was scared you would go first for her phobic reaction.  It would be awkward having to walk up to a co-worker and announce your sexuality.  I thought you handled it well\n\nPlease post an update as to what HR did", "NTA", "NTA, how come it's in for her to talk about her relationships and you can't talk about yours? She's descriminating your sexuality if any thing", "NTA\n\nI think you handled it well. She had every opportunity to respond with a light hearted \u201cI guess that would give you a pretty small circle of friends!\u201d - or similar. Instead, she showed her biases. \n\nIt should be interesting to see how HR handles it, because, at least I\u2019m my state where sexual orientation is protected, basically just reported herself.", "NTA. You were totally right, and those kinds of rules in relationships are creepy and controlling.", "NTA", "She doesn't think sexuality should be discussed but is mad you hadn't told her about it at the same time? Pick a side, pick a side. NTA.", "NTA if the workplace isn\u2019t a place to be discussing sexuality, neither is it the place to be going on about your trust issues with your partner", "Even that you shared personal information in response to her sharing the same level of personal information. OP got no more intimate than her coworker has been first.", "Nope, she doesn't get a warning that people have a minority status, so that she can check her homophobia.", "As someone who is the head of the LGBTQIA+ committee for the employee resource group within the company I work for AND a pansexual person, what your coworker did was a microaggression in the workplace. \n\nShe assumed your sexuality to be straight by assuming the sex of your partner. That is a workplace microaggression against LGBTQIA+ ppl. \n\nYou were absolutely NTA in this situation. Your coworker is the AH, and she needs to attend training on being a better ally to POC and LGBTQIA+ ppl in the workplace. She needs to learn about microaggressions and how to undo heteronormative assumptions.", "Okay, first of all, that's dumb (you'd be just as bisexual if you were currently dating a man). Secondly, in case it isn't clear already, you are definitely NTA. I've had similar situations come up, and I can almost guarantee there was no natural point you could have come out that would have made that coworker more comfortable. \n\nThat being said, though, I might consider apologizing if I were you. Not because you were wrong (because, again, you were not), but because it's sometimes better not to drag these things out with coworkers. I'm guessing, at this point, you already know that you're not gonna be good friends with this person, so it's kind of a question of whether you want/need to have a friendly working relationship with her. If you do, apologizing is a much more direct route than waiting for her to come around.", "This. I'm pansexual and my husband bisexual. We would both have no friends lmao", "It's like if you leave two people alone together for longer than five seconds, they'll fall on each other in a sex-crazed frenzy or something. Smh", "Tbh as this point Hailee and her boyfriend Jeremiah do a better job conducting an audit than the fucking IRS.", "Either they\u2019re gay or a cowboy. Maybe a gay cowboy. That would be fun.", "Ehh\u2026this is a misconceived assumption. I often say partner because it feels weird to refer to my boyfriend of 10 years as my boyfriend. Most people assume we\u2019re married because we have a child together and have been together for so long. His friends sometimes refer to me as his wife, which is fine, but I personally don\u2019t refer to myself as that or him as my husband because\u2026well\u2026he\u2019s *not*. We\u2019re also in our thirties and well, when you\u2019re in your thirties and have been together so long, personally it feels a bit adolescent(?)/superficial(?)\u2014 not sure how to properly convey my feelings on it without offense \u2014 to refer to each other as boyfriend/girlfriend. It\u2019s also not as if we won\u2019t get married someday, it\u2019s just not really a priority for us right now. So boyfriend seems insufficient.", "I said not to assume one way or another- because partner is a gender-neutral term that is commonly used by people trying to stray away from terms like bf/gf/husband/wife- I have a friend in your exact situation- she doesn\u2019t want to get married, but her live-in partner certainly is more than a bf in her mind"]}
