You shouldn't be shocked he's trying to find an excuse not to go. \n\nI say your focus should be on telling you mother she's the one ruining your wedding.

I wish you a happy and peaceful wedding day and a blissful marriage, OP.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, at this point, I'd say cancel the entire wedding and just elope.  If your mom's boyfriend is a narcissist, there's literally no way he'll ever change.\n\nI'd advise you go permanent NC with your mom and her boyfriend, because as long as **he** doesn't change, she won't, either.  Don't bother recommending therapy because, unless someone truly wants to change, they won't benefit from it at all.\n\nI hope you and your soon-to-be-husband have a fantastic life.", "NTA - stay NC", "It sounds like your life has plenty of drama without adding to it.

Firstly, it's important to remember that this is your wedding day and ultimately, you and your fianc\u00e9 get to decide who is invited. It's understandable that you want to keep it small and intimate, and it's okay to stick to that plan even if it upsets some family members.\n\nThat being said, it's clear that there are some underlying issues between your mom and her boyfriend that are causing tension. While it's not necessarily your responsibility to fix those issues, it's understandable that you may feel caught in the middle. It's also important to consider your relationship with your mom and whether cutting her out of your life entirely is the best solution.\n\nIn terms of whether you're the asshole in this situation, it's difficult to say without knowing the full extent of the relationship dynamics and past history. However, it's clear that you're feeling frustrated and overwhelmed by the situation, and it's okay to set boundaries and stand up for yourself. It's important to communicate your feelings in a calm and respectful manner, but also to prioritize your own needs and happiness.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
