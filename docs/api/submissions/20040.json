{"id": 20040, "submission_id": "14d5f9i", "title": "AITA for not accommodating a friend's vegan coworker at a dinner party?", "selftext": "A couple weeks ago I invited 5 friends over for a dinner party. I told my friends they could each bring a +1. On Monday 4 of the 5 friends had said they were bringing a +1. I made a group text with every in it and asked about any allergies/dietary restrictions. I got the replies and put together 4 dishes that could accommodate everyone. On Wednesday, I sent out the menu and asked if everyone was ok with it, and everyone was.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the friend who hadn't had a +1 asked if he could invite his coworker. I agreed. I hadn't shopped yet, so it would be easy enough. It turns out his co worker is vegan, but he didn't mention it to me at the time even though he already knew the menu. Maybe I should have asked about dietary restrictions, but I was at work and distracted.\n\nOn Friday night, I had already started some of the prep for the meal. My friend adds his coworker to the group text and she asks what will be served. When another friend posts it, she comes back with a massive wall of text. Some of the highlights include her saying that at least half the dishes at any event with food must be vegan because vegans shouldn't have to announce they are vegan. If they have to say they are vegan, that's the same as forcing Jewish people wear yellow stars during the Holocaust. She also demanded that I add at least 2 vegan friendly dishes to the menu otherwise it proves that I hate both animals and minorities (apparently being vegan makes you a minority). \n\nI responded saying that I had already bought the food and started the prep work and I was afraid I couldn't accommodate her this time. To be honest, I could have tweaked 2 of the dishes with what I had on hand, but first, while I like to cook, it isn't easy cooking for so many people and I hate when people take the effort I put into it for granted by, say, demanding I add 2 more dishes to the menu last minute. Second, based on her rant in the group text, I didn't want this person at my dinner party. Both my friend and his coworker exploded the group text with insults and more rants about how put upon vegans are.\n\nIf she had politely asked for some vegan friendly dishes, I would have gladly tweaked the menu even if it was last minute.\n\nThe friend and his coworker didn't come to the dinner party. I and the people who did come had a great time. Some of them posted on facebook about it. The friend and his coworker commented on all the posts saying how I refused to accommodate her dietary needs. Since the dinner party last night, I've gotten a couple dozen messages, some from people I know, some from friends of the coworker, saying that I should always be willing to accommodate someone's dietary needs even if it is last minute and that 24 hours is more than enough time to shop again. I would normally brush this sort of thing off, but some of the people telling me I was being insensitive are people that I consider to be fairly reasonable. Am I missing something here?

Your friend is a complete AH and his coworker is insufferable.  I\u2019m like you in that I would be more than happy to accommodate somebody who is polite.  But no way in hell would I change a thing for somebody like that.  It\u2019s no wonder vegans get such a bad rap in memes.", "NTA. There's a particular species of vegans whose entire identity is based on what they eat. They attack indigenous people for eating animal products that are traditional to their cultures. They judge poor people whose best source of protein is fast-food meat. They feel entitled to be catered to, and blow up into drama when they feel \"discriminated\". Needless to say these militant vegans are most often wealthy (so they can afford expensive meat substitutes) and white. \n\nIt seems that you encountered such a vegan. You did nothing wrong. You were an accommodating host. As a vegetarian myself, I make it a point to tell hosts, if asked (which you did), not because I expect much, but because I don't want them to feel bad if I show up and don't eat the food they worked so hard to prepare. I would never comment on the lack of vegetarian options even if I did tell the host in advance. I'd just nibble on bread and salad, enjoy the company, and get something to eat later.", "NTA.\n\nLook on the bright side. Imagine how miserable your dinner party would have been if this smug, entitled, rude, tedious and insufferable woman had actually showed up and decided to opine in person rather than via text.\n\nThe Auschwitz Museum is on record admonishing anti-vaxxers who try to align themselves with victims of the Holocaust. They call it \"a sign of intellectual and moral degeneration\". I haven't seen them offer an opinion of vegans who do the same thing, but I suspect it wouldn't be complimentary.", "NTA - I'm vegan, and yes it sucks to have to \"announce\" it around dinner events (especially with people coming to me to make comments about it) but wtf did she really compare that to wearing a yellow star?

I wouldn't have changed anything after that rant she made where she insults all of you while she expects you to go out of your way for a +1 she included 24 hours before the meal. That was rude as hell.", "NTA you gave plenty of time to alert you to any allergens. You then announced the menu and there was no comment.

Is *that* equal to the yellow star of the Holocaust? Does she even understand the devastation of the yellow stars that she's throwing around? \n\nI'd block her on every single platform and be clear she is never to be a +1 in your home. I do not allow people who minimize and undercut the seriousness of the Holocaust in my home. That's a pretty hard and fast rule. It's a form of anti-Semitism and anti-Semites are not allowed in if I can help it. \n\nFor anyone on her side in this, screenshot her rant and forward it. It will tell you **very** quickly who else might be minimizing history in problematic ways.\n\nAnd, as a person who loves to cook, I'll take any diet into consideration, but I need warning.
