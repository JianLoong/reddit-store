{"id": 20040, "submission_id": "14d5f9i", "title": "AITA for not accommodating a friend's vegan coworker at a dinner party?", "selftext": "A couple weeks ago I invited 5 friends over for a dinner party. I told my friends they could each bring a +1. On Monday 4 of the 5 friends had said they were bringing a +1. I made a group text with every in it and asked about any allergies/dietary restrictions. I got the replies and put together 4 dishes that could accommodate everyone. On Wednesday, I sent out the menu and asked if everyone was ok with it, and everyone was.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the friend who hadn't had a +1 asked if he could invite his coworker. I agreed. I hadn't shopped yet, so it would be easy enough. It turns out his co worker is vegan, but he didn't mention it to me at the time even though he already knew the menu. Maybe I should have asked about dietary restrictions, but I was at work and distracted.\n\nOn Friday night, I had already started some of the prep for the meal. My friend adds his coworker to the group text and she asks what will be served. When another friend posts it, she comes back with a massive wall of text. Some of the highlights include her saying that at least half the dishes at any event with food must be vegan because vegans shouldn't have to announce they are vegan. If they have to say they are vegan, that's the same as forcing Jewish people wear yellow stars during the Holocaust. She also demanded that I add at least 2 vegan friendly dishes to the menu otherwise it proves that I hate both animals and minorities (apparently being vegan makes you a minority). \n\nI responded saying that I had already bought the food and started the prep work and I was afraid I couldn't accommodate her this time. To be honest, I could have tweaked 2 of the dishes with what I had on hand, but first, while I like to cook, it isn't easy cooking for so many people and I hate when people take the effort I put into it for granted by, say, demanding I add 2 more dishes to the menu last minute. Second, based on her rant in the group text, I didn't want this person at my dinner party. Both my friend and his coworker exploded the group text with insults and more rants about how put upon vegans are.\n\nIf she had politely asked for some vegan friendly dishes, I would have gladly tweaked the menu even if it was last minute.\n\nThe friend and his coworker didn't come to the dinner party. I and the people who did come had a great time. Some of them posted on facebook about it. The friend and his coworker commented on all the posts saying how I refused to accommodate her dietary needs. Since the dinner party last night, I've gotten a couple dozen messages, some from people I know, some from friends of the coworker, saying that I should always be willing to accommodate someone's dietary needs even if it is last minute and that 24 hours is more than enough time to shop again. I would normally brush this sort of thing off, but some of the people telling me I was being insensitive are people that I consider to be fairly reasonable. Am I missing something here? Am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1687152238, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14d5f9i/aita_for_not_accommodating_a_friends_vegan/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My eye appointment is overdue\n\nIf she really said that she's an entitled crazy person. \n\nTo be clear, being vegan is NOT a restriction. It is a self-imposed choice. \n\nThe only person responsible for satisfying that choice is her.\n\nWould it be courteous for you to try to accommodate her? Sure.\n\nPresumably your friend already knew his +1 was vegan so he dropped the ball by not telling you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing a vegan is not a demographic and not a minority. I honestly don't know if I believe this post it's so stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. You provided her several options including two tailor made for her, Choice 1. Make do, or Choice 2. Fuck off", "NTA I\u2019d copy and paste/screenshot her rant and post it as a response when people asked what she was on about. \n\nAnd then block both her and your bad friend from seeing your account and posts.", "NTA and Holy smokes the audacity! Your friend is TA. 1 for not getting back to you straight up and 2 for not telling you that his Co worker was a vegan. After that barrage of text I wouldn't want her in my house either", "NTA.  Your friend is a complete AH and his coworker is insufferable.  I\u2019m like you in that I would be more than happy to accommodate somebody who is polite.  But no way in hell would I change a thing for somebody like that.  It\u2019s no wonder vegans get such a bad rap in memes.", "NTA. There's a particular species of vegans whose entire identity is based on what they eat. They attack indigenous people for eating animal products that are traditional to their cultures. They judge poor people whose best source of protein is fast-food meat. They feel entitled to be catered to, and blow up into drama when they feel \"discriminated\". Needless to say these militant vegans are most often wealthy (so they can afford expensive meat substitutes) and white. \n\nIt seems that you encountered such a vegan. You did nothing wrong. You were an accommodating host. As a vegetarian myself, I make it a point to tell hosts, if asked (which you did), not because I expect much, but because I don't want them to feel bad if I show up and don't eat the food they worked so hard to prepare. I would never comment on the lack of vegetarian options even if I did tell the host in advance. I'd just nibble on bread and salad, enjoy the company, and get something to eat later.", "NTA.\n\nLook on the bright side. Imagine how miserable your dinner party would have been if this smug, entitled, rude, tedious and insufferable woman had actually showed up and decided to opine in person rather than via text.\n\nThe Auschwitz Museum is on record admonishing anti-vaxxers who try to align themselves with victims of the Holocaust. They call it \"a sign of intellectual and moral degeneration\". I haven't seen them offer an opinion of vegans who do the same thing, but I suspect it wouldn't be complimentary.", "NTA - I'm vegan, and yes it sucks to have to \"announce\" it around dinner events (especially with people coming to me to make comments about it) but wtf did she really compare that to wearing a yellow star? She's being a drama queen. You were right to not accommodate her.", "NTA.\n\n>I made a group text with every in it and asked about any allergies/dietary restrictions. I got the replies and put together 4 dishes that could accommodate everyone.

It turns out his co worker is vegan, but he didn't mention it to me at the time even though he already knew the menu.\n\nStill no problems on your part. The rest of what happens is complete and utter nonsense. You did absolutely nothing wrong. Your \"friend\" set you up.", "Nta, and you handled that a lot nicer than I would have.  That person is a loon.  Even if you had done as she demanded, I'm sure you'd get nothing but judgemental attitude for the rest of your dishes and daring to have fun while people are eating animals in her presence.", "NTA and people wonder why I refuse to get Facebook! Lol you don\u2019t have to adjust your event because a rude, entitled stranger was invited.", "Lmao you know in your heart your NTA, trust that. \n\nAnyone comparing themselves to being Jewish during nazi era for being vegan.. is unhinged.. \n\nCoworker and his +1 are not your people, leave them behind", "NTA\n\nYour friend had no chance in my mind after the yellow star comparison.", "NTA.   \nAs you have discovered, vegans are a nasty cult.\n\nLose the friend.", "NTA\n\nShe one of those vegans that give vegans a bad reputation, the only AHs here are the friend and his co worker, he should have let you know and she should accept the world does not revolve around her. I would probably have told her I could go cut my lawn and give to her", "NTA. Where you went wrong was trying to accommodate people in the first place. That leads to a slippery slope of everyone making demands until fifteen minutes after the party starts. \nNext time, declare a menu in advance:  \"I am roasting a suckling pig and am making potato salad and hominy grits. The food will be ready at 6pm. I would love to have you join me.\" Or have a potluck so that everyone knows there will be at least one thing there that they can eat.", "NTA. Walk away, OP. Can't reason with fundamentalists", "NTA\n\nThat person has confirmed to you all the prejudices you might have had towards vegans. \n\nPersonally i would screenshot that wall of text (plus if there were other messages between that and when they joined the chat) and share that with friends, addind \"i generally agree with the text, but this isnt how you ask to accommodate a vegan diet\". They are kinda private messages so that might or might not make me an AH tho :)", "What a self-righteous windbag the co-worker is. This is the type of person that gives vegans a bad name.  If she was really interested in joining the party and not just being a grandstanding jerk, she could have offered to bring something vegan to help you out, especially as she knows she was a late add. OP, you are definitely NTA.", "NTA.  I have been vegetarian for decades, since long before it was fashionable.  I have never demanded special treatment at social events, either bringing my own contribution (for myself and others to share), or just eating beforehand if it was going to be an issue.\n\nObviously things have changed over the past few years, and hosts such as yourself now bend over backwards to accommodate special diets.  But it seems like nothing is good enough for some people.", "Being a vegan isn\u2019t a dietary \u201cneed\u201d, it\u2019s a choice and not one you or anybody else should be forced to cater to.", "NTA. \nVegan and vegetarian are choices, not diets based on medical needs or religious beliefs. \n\nI\u2019m stunned by the audacity of this \u201c+1\u201d guest to DEMAND last-minute changes to your planned menu; and then to compare your non-compliance to that of the persecution of Jews and calling it prima facia evidence of \u201chate toward animals and minorities.\u201d \n\nMy reply would have been: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t hate animals and minorities\u2026 but I certainly don\u2019t like YOU!\u201d", "NTA\n\nYour friend is, though. I wouldn't have changed anything after that rant she made where she insults all of you while she expects you to go out of your way for a +1 she included 24 hours before the meal. That was rude as hell.", "NTA you gave plenty of time to alert you to any allergens. You then announced the menu and there was no comment. A day before the event a stranger was invited and went off on a rant about how you didn\u2019t accommodate a dietary requirement that you weren\u2019t aware of. I would block the coworker on everything and I wouldn\u2019t invite the friend to any further events. He messed up and blamed you for it before attempting to publicly humiliate you. That\u2019s no my a friend- that\u2019s an asshole.", "NTA! The audacity of this friend and coworker. I'm a picky eater but I'll always agree to whatever the host wants on their menu. If I don't like it, I'll bring my own food. It's that easy.\n\n>at least half the dishes at any event with food must be vegan because vegans shouldn't have to announce they are vegan. If they have to say they are vegan, that's the same as forcing Jewish people wear yellow stars during the Holocaust.\n\nThe entitlement! THE AUDACITY!", "As a Jewish person, comparing the holocaust to not being accommodated vegan dishes feels antisemitic lol", "NTA \n\nI'd be really curious if she thinks Jewish people need to say if they're Kosher or are all menus required to have 2 Kosher dishes? Is *that* equal to the yellow star of the Holocaust? Does she even understand the devastation of the yellow stars that she's throwing around? \n\nI'd block her on every single platform and be clear she is never to be a +1 in your home. I do not allow people who minimize and undercut the seriousness of the Holocaust in my home. That's a pretty hard and fast rule. It's a form of anti-Semitism and anti-Semites are not allowed in if I can help it. \n\nFor anyone on her side in this, screenshot her rant and forward it. It will tell you **very** quickly who else might be minimizing history in problematic ways.\n\nAnd, as a person who loves to cook, I'll take any diet into consideration, but I need warning. I can't read your mind. And while I'll likely have vegetarian options, I almost definitely won't have vegan options without notice (because, butter makes everything better... duh!)", "As your wrote it, NTA.\n\nHowever your repeated long winded stories mocking obese people make me think there is more to this story and that maybe you are not that good of a person.", "NTA and i must  confess i didn;t read the whole text. your home is not a restaurant!, that freaking entited girl doesn't even know you, plans on coming to your house and thats how she acts?!!!!! o m g", "NTA. Respond to everyone that you don't know friends co-worker and asked well in advance that the menu was acceptable to everyone. \n\nWhen your friend asked for a +1 after the menu was set you asked again if the menu was acceptable and he never said a word he even waited until last minute to add her to the group chat and her immediate response was to rant? Push the blame back onto your \"friend\" where it belongs.\n\nWas his coworker that vegan teacher by any chance? and was he just trying to create conflict so he could be her white knight and get in her pants?", "NTA - Yes, you should be willing to accommodate the dietary needs/preferences of the people you invite to dinner, that is, the people that you would like to be present. You are under no obligation whatsoever to cater to the whims of any plus ones, whether they give you adequate notice or not. \nYour coworker saw the menu and it was their responsibility to ensure whoever they invited would be fine with that food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
