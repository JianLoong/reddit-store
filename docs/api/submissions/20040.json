I told my friends they could each bring a +1. On Monday 4 of the 5 friends had said they were bringing a +1. I made a group text with every in it and asked about any allergies/dietary restrictions. I got the replies and put together 4 dishes that could accommodate everyone. On Wednesday, I sent out the menu and asked if everyone was ok with it, and everyone was.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the friend who hadn't had a +1 asked if he could invite his coworker. I agreed. I hadn't shopped yet, so it would be easy enough. It turns out his co worker is vegan, but he didn't mention it to me at the time even though he already knew the menu. Maybe I should have asked about dietary restrictions, but I was at work and distracted.\n\nOn Friday night, I had already started some of the prep for the meal. My friend adds his coworker to the group text and she asks what will be served. When another friend posts it, she comes back with a massive wall of text. Some of the highlights include her saying that at least half the dishes at any event with food must be vegan because vegans shouldn't have to announce they are vegan. If they have to say they are vegan, that's the same as forcing Jewish people wear yellow stars during the Holocaust. She also demanded that I add at least 2 vegan friendly dishes to the menu otherwise it proves that I hate both animals and minorities (apparently being vegan makes you a minority). \n\nI responded saying that I had already bought the food and started the prep work and I was afraid I couldn't accommodate her this time. To be honest, I could have tweaked 2 of the dishes with what I had on hand, but first, while I like to cook, it isn't easy cooking for so many people and I hate when people take the effort I put into it for granted by, say, demanding I add 2 more dishes to the menu last minute. Second, based on her rant in the group text, I didn't want this person at my dinner party. Both my friend and his coworker exploded the group text with insults and more rants about how put upon vegans are.\n\nIf she had politely asked for some vegan friendly dishes, I would have gladly tweaked the menu even if it was last minute.\n\nThe friend and his coworker didn't come to the dinner party. I and the people who did come had a great time. Some of them posted on facebook about it. The friend and his coworker commented on all the posts saying how I refused to accommodate her dietary needs. Since the dinner party last night, I've gotten a couple dozen messages, some from people I know, some from friends of the coworker, saying that I should always be willing to accommodate someone's dietary needs even if it is last minute and that 24 hours is more than enough time to shop again. I would normally brush this sort of thing off, but some of the people telling me I was being insensitive are people that I consider to be fairly reasonable. Am I missing something here?

Your friend is a complete AH and his coworker is insufferable.  I\u2019m like you in that I would be more than happy to accommodate somebody who is polite.  But no way in hell would I change a thing for somebody like that.  It\u2019s no wonder vegans get such a bad rap in memes.", "NTA. There's a particular species of vegans whose entire identity is based on what they eat. They attack indigenous people for eating animal products that are traditional to their cultures. They judge poor people whose best source of protein is fast-food meat. They feel entitled to be catered to, and blow up into drama when they feel \"discriminated\". Needless to say these militant vegans are most often wealthy (so they can afford expensive meat substitutes) and white. \n\nIt seems that you encountered such a vegan. You did nothing wrong. You were an accommodating host. As a vegetarian myself, I make it a point to tell hosts, if asked (which you did), not because I expect much, but because I don't want them to feel bad if I show up and don't eat the food they worked so hard to prepare. I would never comment on the lack of vegetarian options even if I did tell the host in advance. I'd just nibble on bread and salad, enjoy the company, and get something to eat later.", "NTA.\n\nLook on the bright side. Imagine how miserable your dinner party would have been if this smug, entitled, rude, tedious and insufferable woman had actually showed up and decided to opine in person rather than via text.\n\nThe Auschwitz Museum is on record admonishing anti-vaxxers who try to align themselves with victims of the Holocaust. They call it \"a sign of intellectual and moral degeneration\". I haven't seen them offer an opinion of vegans who do the same thing, but I suspect it wouldn't be complimentary.", "NTA - I'm vegan, and yes it sucks to have to \"announce\" it around dinner events (especially with people coming to me to make comments about it) but wtf did she really compare that to wearing a yellow star?

I wouldn't have changed anything after that rant she made where she insults all of you while she expects you to go out of your way for a +1 she included 24 hours before the meal. That was rude as hell.", "NTA you gave plenty of time to alert you to any allergens. You then announced the menu and there was no comment.

Is *that* equal to the yellow star of the Holocaust? Does she even understand the devastation of the yellow stars that she's throwing around? \n\nI'd block her on every single platform and be clear she is never to be a +1 in your home. I do not allow people who minimize and undercut the seriousness of the Holocaust in my home. That's a pretty hard and fast rule. It's a form of anti-Semitism and anti-Semites are not allowed in if I can help it. \n\nFor anyone on her side in this, screenshot her rant and forward it. It will tell you **very** quickly who else might be minimizing history in problematic ways.\n\nAnd, as a person who loves to cook, I'll take any diet into consideration, but I need warning.

The plus one just dove right in after shopping and prep had begun.", "Being Vegan is not about that, we just want to cause as less harm to animals as we can an see eating them as disrespectful and harmful since us Vegans wouldn't eat a person or our pets.\n\nThis is kind of why I haven't told any of the friends I've been making I'm Vegan because of how the most annoying ones like OP's friend's CoWorker get the most attention and make the rest of Vegan look bad. Because if she didn't want to say it there are ways to avoid it, probably harder since he was making food and they never met, but then again she could of told her coworker she rather hang out with his friends somewhere not food related. or cooked a side dish for herself and everyone to eat to introduce herself.", "They don't need to, it just happens to be their favourite pastime.", "Yes this is exactly what was I was thinking and typed! if I was in that situation. Vegan here too.", "Tell them to ge to fuck. How dare they encourage this madness? I say this as a coeliac.", "THANK YOU SO MUCH for posting this!!\n\nI'm sorry she's causing you problems, but I genuinely got a kick out of this.\n\n1) I don't know what commune she's living on, but most people are not vegan.\n\n2) If the majority of people were vegan, then eating out would be no issue because most dishes would be vegan to appeal to the masses.\n\n3) I'd love to hear her explain how vegans can be both the majority *and* a minority (unless she happens to be a minority with regards to race and is conflating the two)?\n\n4) Again, if the majority of people choose to eat vegan, how can it also be a choice no one respects?\n\nBut the one that made me laugh the most: \n\"Please note that I consider alcohol to be vegan despite yeast being involved in the making of most alcoholic beverages.\" \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 So basically she's a militant vegan, unless it interferes with her getting drunk. \ud83d\ude02\n\nThis lady is something I can't say without this post getting deleted, so I'll just say her behavior is unhinged. She insulted you and your guests before even meeting you, and that's what I would tell anyone challenging you. \"I have never met this person, and she chose to make her first encounter with us one that centered around insulting me and my guests and minimizing the Holocaust. Could I have accommodated her? Of course! However, given her behavior, I was no longer interested in hosting her and thought telling her I couldn't accommodate her dietary restrictions was more polite than saying her boorish behavior was unwelcome in my home.\"", "No, no, its not drama. She DESERVES to pop off on OP for not buying an entirety new set of pots/pans so that the dishes could be cooked somewhere meat has never touched. Literally during ACTIVE food prep. OP is unreasonable for so much as thinking otherwise!\n\n/s", "she was mentally unwell too. you\u2019re not an asshole but she was AND was mentally unwell. if it don\u2019t apply let it fly", "Yeah that menu would just be air. Just think about all the allergies out there...", "This idea that vegans are directly attacking indigenous people or food insecure people for eating meat is a big one. I have been in the vegan community for a LONG time, and way too active in online discussions/arguments about it for most of that time - probably 15 years. Indigenous and food insecure people are only ever brought up as a \"whatbout\" kind of argument by defensive omnivores who are trying to poke holes in veganism. The idea that \"militant\" vegans are mostly white and wealthy is another stretch that erases the existence of vegans of color. I am what you would probably consider a \"militant\" vegan because I am very direct about it when people ask, and have participated in direct action, rescue, and more on behalf of animals. I can't think of a fellow militant vegan I have met who has directly attacked indigenous people or someone who had little money for food.\n\nYour very first statement is a distortion as well, now that I think of it. Vegans are motivated by protecting animals from those who eat them or their products. It's an over simplification to say that there are vegans whose \"entire identity is based on what they eat.\" I'll be the first to say that I have had periods of time when my identity has been defined by veganism to an unhealthy degree, but I was motivated by my desire to protect animals, not by my diet.", "Avoid this friend", "Yeah, my impression is of a guy who decided last minute to ask her out to this, then decided to try to get in good with her by supporting her ridiculous entitled behavior.  A good friend would have worked to tamp down any menu kerfuffle, and when she pressed on anyway would have supported you and cut her loose.  It sounds like they\u2019re addicted to drama and performative outrage and they\u2019re engaging in a narcissistic smear campaign on you.  Utterly ridiculous and undeserved.  Stand firm!  NTA", "I had a vegetarian/vegan cousin (she switched between them at various times) who made that demand for entirely new pots/pans/utensils/dishes. She always refused to bring her own food and always insisted that everyone must give in to her demands.\n\nI can't imagine why I have not spoken to her in over 20 years.", "Yes an letting someone know before hand of any allergies can help too. there are so many recipes and store bought Vegan foods that cane be made soy-free, nut-free, Gluten-Free, it's amazing what seasoning, and different oils, and sauces and preparation the endless different combinations of meals that can be made", "The old lady whose TikTok account is literally \"that vegan teacher \"?", "Right? I can\u2019t eat gluten or soy, I keep a meal bar in my car just in case I can\u2019t eat at an event lol I don\u2019t call people Nazis! Hell even if people tried to accommodate me 99% of the time things get cross-contaminated and I end up sick anyway.", "That\u2019s not true at all. Many people cannot/won\u2019t eat meat because their ethics do not allow it. There is no ethical stance against spinach. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s exactly the same as if you had a Jewish guest. You obviously do not serve them pork or meat and dairy on the same plate. You equally do not expect them to serve you pork and mixed plates when you go to their home. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not arguing about OP. They are clearly NTA. But the issue here isn\u2019t veganism. It is one deranged individual who happens to be vegan.", "But that\u2019s what informing people of dietary restrictions is for? I agree that OP is NTA. Massively NTA. I was only responding to the commenter that said vegans should have to serve meat in their own homes when having guests over.", "A choice made for ethical or even religious reasons *is* still a choice. \n\nI\u2019ve been plant based for 20 years or so, it\u2019s a choice I made, not something I physically can not do", "What if I eat a low plant diet. I\u2019d need to have 2 predominantly meat items present", "That\u2019s fair enough if you see it that way. I think the difference here is use of language. \u201cI *cannot* eat animal products and sustain my ethics at the same time\u201d shortens to \u201cI can\u2019t eat animal products\u201d but has exactly the same meaning as what you are saying.", "Then don\u2019t go or eat beforehand? If you\u2019re not comfortable serving food without animal products then don\u2019t invite vegans over. If you\u2019re not comfortable eating food without animal products then don\u2019t go to a vegans home. I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re creating an issue out of this? Dietary requirements are the burden of the individual. Not anyone offering to host."]}
