Mark passed away, and Sarah and her kids understandably hate Anna and Rachel. \n\nRachel got a long sentence, first in a youth custody centre and then moved to adult prison when she was of age. I was friends with Anna before it all happened, because Rachel used to tutor my kids in maths and also used to give my daughter fashion/outfit advice. I still casually speak to Anna, because I understand she and her husband are going through a tough time too. \n\nI own an accounting firm, and recently Anna said Rachel would be out soon and would need a job, so asked if I'd take Rachel on as a trainee. She showed me Rachel's school exam results from before she got arrested, and they were very impressive. Particularly maths, where Rachel got full marks in every exam. I thought a talented kid like that deserved an opportunity to turn her life around and would be a great asset to my company. \n\nWhen I saw Sarah I explained that I'd agreed to take Rachel on, and she was understandably very upset and angry. She didn't understand how I could \"just ignore\" what Rachel did to her husband. I'm not ignoring it and I'm not minimizing it. But she's a talented young women who's just had an awful time, and now deserves an opportunity to turn her life around. \n\nMy husband thinks I'm being insensitive by giving Rachel the chance, but I don't think I am.

Sarah has every right to not want to be around anything even remotely connected with Rachel, and you voluntarily giving her a job puts you in that category for her.  Even suggesting this to Sarah may sour your friendship long-term, which is just the way things like this can go.  \nWhat Rachel did was horrible, and it\u2019s at bare minimum clueless to think that you can help Rachel start a new life while maintaining your relationship with Sarah.", "I don't think it's fair to call you an asshole.\n\nBut, if I was Sarah, I would be cutting you out of my life immediately. This isn't some random ex-con from prison that you're giving a chance. It's her husband's murderer. There really isn't any getting around that. \n\nYou have a choice here. Whose friendship is worth more to you? Anna's or Sarah's.", ">She got behind the wheel and ended up hitting \"Mark\" whose wife \"Sarah\" I'm good friends with.

Was she at the time?  Has she apologized to Sarah and her kids?  Was drinking and driving common for her, or was this an isolated incident?  I believe in second chances, but...\n\nI can't decide on a judgement.  You have every right to hire anyone you want, and your instinct to help is admirable, which are N T A.  But Sarah is supposedly your \"good friend.\"  You watched her and her children grieve and enormous loss, and you didn't give her the respect of discussing this with her before making your decision.  Sarah likely feels blind-sided and betrayed, which lean me back toward Y T A.  I doubt you have a friendship with Sarah now, regardless.", "Conflicted because of your line  \"who's just had an awful time\" it sounds like you think she was punished unfairly.", "You 'were' close friends with Sarah.  You won't be after this.", "NAH to he honest after reading this I could never give her a chance. I'm not that big of a person and I despise drunk drivers. I 100% get why Sarah can't forgive your desicion and I would expect that choosing to help Rachel means losing Sarah forever. \n\nThat said I don't believe that Rachel should die for her crime and that means she has to be able to afford food and housing. Which means someone needs to give her a job. That's just life. You are honestly being pretty mature and compassionate by realizing that and giving her a chance to rebuild. Especially given that she was very young at the time and that it likely destroyed any life dreams she had in that instant. \n\nIt's a sad awful situation and you'll have to weigh your compassion for Rachel against your desire to be Sarah's friend. Because those two things can't exist together.", "Leaning towards YTA. \n\nYou run your own accounting firm. This tells me you have a network. Clients, colleagues, etc. It seems to me you could honor Anna by making some referrals for Rachel and helping her make connections, while simultaneously honoring Sarah by not actively mentoring and employing her husband\u2019s murderer.", "NAH, but obviously your decision is likely to end your friendship with Sarah. You should have been prepared for that before you agreed to anything.", "YTA.

I sympathize and understand the hatred. I really do.

Knowing how much this would hurt your friend and her kids? Why get yourself involved? Unless of course you don't give a shit about Sarah, then you do you.", "NAH. Things like this are hard to get over but once someone has completed their time or in other cases, recovery services, earning a living and finding a place to live can be very difficult. And you have an opportunity to not only hire and mentor her. I think it is awesome.", "NTA/YTA What about a middle point? Ask any acquaitant, friend or whatever, to give her a chance (she deserves redemption) and tell Sarah you have decided not to hire her because you value her friendship (no need to tell her you indirectly helped her).", "NAH, but you've created a situation that is going to leave someone hurt. Rachel may well deserve a break, as does every other parolee. It doesn't have to be someone close to Sarah that gives her that break. You'd have been better off quietly referring her to another place that doesn't have a friendship with Sarah. Not only did you hire her yourself, you openly told Sarah.", "NAH, but by giving Rachel this opportunity you are no longer Sarah\u2019s good friend. You\u2019ve chosen the other side now.", "I empathize with Sarah, because you say you\u2019re good friends. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine the hate you feel towards the person that killed your husband while drunk driving. It\u2019s normal to expect your friends to feel the same way, i would also feel betrayed. She killed her husband. \n\nIf this hadn\u2019t been connected to one of your friends, I would have agreed with you.

See if they would hire her, if they would not, you are just being bias in the hiring process and damaging your friendship at the same time.

Oh, wait, because of what she chose to do he doesn\u2019t get that opportunity.", "NAH. I can understand why you think you're in the right, but at the end of the day, teenager or not, she's responsible for why your other friend doesn't have her husband and why their children don't have a father. They're justified in their anger whether or not the court system decided Rachel has been punished enough.", "YTA. Would you hire her if she had hit your husband? Would you still want to help her out and want to help her rebuild if it was your kids she made fatherless? \n\nYour husband is right and you can probably consider your friendship with Sarah over.", "Yta I can\u2019t see how you can be good friends with Sarah and yet help the person who murdered her husband and left her children fatherless.

It\u2019s great that you want to give her this opportunity, but she\u2019s not entitled to Sarah\u2019s forgiveness. This might end up costing your friendship with Sarah.

In my opinion you should know not to bring up the killer of her husband with her, especially not in a positive light.\n\nGiving Rachel a job is a kind thing to do and I hope she can do good with her life. \n\nBut expecting Sarah to be ok with it after you went \"oh I just gave your husband's killer a job \ud83d\ude0a\" is ridiculous and shows a lack of sensitivity.", "NTA\n\nRachel went to prison and served the time that the judge felt was needed. She is now out. What she did was stupid, what happened because of what she did was devastatingly horrific.
