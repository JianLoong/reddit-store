Seriously bad sleep will kill him faster than burgers and cigarettes for every meal.", "NTA - my husband was exactly like this for years (sometimes still is).\n\nI am also a light sleeper and he would snore so loud, I could hear him down the hall from my living room. He also has apnea and stops breathing.  He would always deny that he snored, so I started recording him.\n\nThe anxiety was awful. He\u2019d start snoring and I couldn\u2019t sleep. If I jostled him to try to get him to roll over, he got pissy. Then he\u2019d stop breathing and I\u2019d lay there wondering \u201cIs this the time he doesn\u2019t start again?\u201d Or there would be the anxiety of laying there knowing that chances were good that as soon as I started to finally drift off, the snoring would start.\n\nI started leaving the room and sleeping on the couch. Then he would come out a few hours later and stand over me, asking if I was planning on coming back to bed that night. It got to the point where I couldn\u2019t sleep there either, knowing he would eventually come out. He complained that he couldn\u2019t sleep as well if I wasn\u2019t there. I asked if he was seriously suggesting I forfeit restful sleep for the rest of my life so that HE could sleep better?

He refused. Didn\u2019t matter if I told him apnea can lead to a whole lot of other health issues. He wasn\u2019t going \u201cto spend a night with all those wires hooked up to me.\u201d If he DID and they told him he needed a CPAP device, \u201cthere\u2019s no way I\u2019m strapping a f-ing mask to my f-ing face every night for the rest of my f-ing life!\u201d\n\nBut I still got all the grief. Grief if I jostled him. Grief if I recorded him. Grief if I left the room. Grief in general because \u201cthis isn\u2019t what I expected from married life, never having my wife in the bed with me\u201d - all while refusing to do anything to fix it! He wouldn\u2019t even wear the nose strips because \u201cthey make the skin on my nose hurt!\u201d\n\nHe eventually caved and told the dr I said he snores and the dr packed him off for a sleep study. He does not have severe enough apnea to warrant a CPAP.\n\nSome night\u2019s he\u2019s better, but I still spend a lot of time on the couch, now I have insomnia, and my overall health is in the toilet. And he still acts like he\u2019s the aggrieved party.\n\nYou might want to look up and show him some of the long term negative health effects of untreated apnea. Maybe the knowledge that he\u2019s potentially shortening his life by years, increasing his risk for heart attacks and high blood pressure will shock him into going for a sleep study.\n\nOr, if you have a spare room, start sleeping there because yes, you need quality sleep as much as he does.\n\nGood luck!", "Nope nope nope NTA.

It probably won't. But if it does there is no shame in sleeping in different rooms. Sleeping together is not for everyone and if it really is affecting the quality of sleep why not sleep apart.

He would snore, begin to sound like he was choking, stop breathing for a while then gasp waking him self up a bit but then go right back to sleep and start the cycle over.

He has a mesh head thing that he wears to keep his mouth closed and then the nose tubey and it's QUIET. I've gone into their room a few times because I can't hear it and my anxiety goes \"oh crap it's not on!\" and I have to check lol.", "I've pulled mine off a couple times too, which is why I have something heavier than my CPAP machine in front of it, to prevent it from being pulled off lol", "I haven't heard about the \"fighter pilot\" version.  Is that the kind you use?", "I got tested a year ago, I had to go in and they did watch me sleep lol", "I'm sorry but that is really funny, because my doctor said something similar.", "Start recording him, make sure you quietly talk while he's snoring so he can't claim it's you.  Next night after he falls asleep turn it on and let it wake him up, and if he gets mad ask him why he can't sleep through it if he expects you to.", "NTA\n\nby the way this was us - my wife was waking me up a couple times a night. \n\nThen I lost my excess body weight during COVID quarantine (on purpose, I\u2019ve been hard at work on a diet) and she says the snoring stopped! I went from 265lbs to 190lbs (I\u2019m 6\u20191 so now I\u2019m pretty lean)", "Your husband has sleep apnea. He needs a doctor and a cpap machine. That\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t sleep well. NTA. He needs to deal with his shit.", "NTA\n\nMy hubby and I used to be super loud snorers. We had weight loss surgery 2 years ago and now barley snore, but we had to take sleep tests before surgery. We both had sleep apnea really bad. My results came back saying I stopped breathing 100 times an hour. Had used a CPAP machine for a while and now I don't need it and I hardly feel tired during the day because I am actually getting good sleep. I really hope your husband gets tested.", "NTA", "As a snorer, your husband is being a dick. That being said, sleeping separately if you have the space to do so is not a bad idea. My girlfriend and I slept separately and we both get much better sleeps than we do when we sleep in the same bed. We had to downsize so now if my snoring is too bad or I know she has an important day the next day, I sleep on the pull-out couch and I don't feel as bad about my snoring waking up the cats. \n\nNTA", "NTA. When I've had boyfriends who are snorers, when they snore I've given them a gentle kick and pretended to be asleep. That way they can't complain without being a dick and waking you up. Do this OP and if he tries telling you you've been nudging him awake, deny it. Say that can't possibly be the case if you were sleeping. And if he nudges you awake, tell him to stop waking you up and lying about you waking him up. Give him a taste of his own medicine.", "My husband snores, and it was a nightmare for years. He was in denial, and I never could get to sleep. What helped was recording him to show him, and buying soft silicone earplugs. The second suggestion changed my life. I can't sleep without them, now. He buys the earplugs. The snoring has reduced a lot since he lost a bit of weight.\n\nETA: Foam earplugs didn't even touch the sides for me. Soft silicone is the only thing that blocks out the noise.", "NTA\n\nBe sure to record not only his snoring but snoring + nudging him + him complaining that he is not snoring and you now woke him. \n\nFor bonus points, do some quiet expository voice over like you\u2019re filming a wildlife documentary.", "I mean, he should see a doctor, but at the same time, there\u2019s not much a doctor will do. Best case scenario they\u2019ll shrug, worst case scenario you end up sleeping next to a cpap machine for the rest of both of your lives. \n\nTbfh it\u2019s time for us as a society to just drop the stigma on having separate bedrooms. So many more relationships would work out. You BOTH deserve a comfortable sleep. ESH.", "NTA - Record him and then enjoy having your own bedroom. Your sleep > his bullshit.", "Just don\u2019t sleep together. He\u2019s unintentionally waking you up. You are intentionally waking him up. Esh", "He needs to understand that he probably needs a sleep therapy intervention. He may suffer extremely poor health if this continues. Good luck convincing him. NTA.", "This was the first 6 years of my (now) marriage. I recommended he talk to a doctor about a sleep study \u2014 my spouse turned out to have not only sleep apnea but also was in dire need of a septoplasty to open his airways. \n\nI would wager your husband is exhausted because he\u2019s not breathing well, not because you ask him to turn. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe should go to a sleep specialist and ask about sleep apnea.\n\nLots of people don\u2019t have a diagnosis because no one talks to their doctor about sleep and even if they do it\u2019s often dismissed. Doctors with old diagnosis criteria will also ignore cases where the patient isn\u2019t overweight or doesn\u2019t have an oxygen saturation issue.", "NTA record a video of him n then shove it in his face like this is you not snoring huh? How well do you think I'm sleeping during this? Go to a sleep specialist", "NTA let him sleep on the couch and see how much sleep he gets", "NTA\n\nHe really needs a sleep test, you both deserve a good nights sleep. My bf has a horrific snore, you can hear him over a relatively loud tv in a different room not directly connected to the bedroom. He's on the NHS waiting list here in the UK for a CPAP because he has mild to moderate sleep apnea. \n\nHe was the same until I recorded him, then he realised how bad it was and got the test done for both our sakes. Hope things work out for you guys", "ESH - You both care about your own sleep more than your partner's.  Both should get sleep tests.  Yours for sleeping too lightly, his for sleeping too deeply.", "NTA. My wife didn\u2019t believe that she had sleep apnea until I recorded her. This was during our first year of living together, and I couldn\u2019t sleep because she\u2019d stop breathing. As soon as she heard how awful her snoring was, she stopped resisting the idea of taking care of it. I hope the same happens for you.", "Stop coddling him, he is a grown ass man, not a toddler and not your child. \n\nLet him sleep in a separate room and snore.\nHe just learned to use his incompetence to manipulate you into doing things for him he is to lazy to do. NTA, but have more respect for yourself my love \ud83d\ude18", "There are a few other remedies for sleep apnea: oral appliances, a good saline nose rinse before bed, sleeping on a wedge, dietary changes work for some folks.\n\nWe both wear oxygen sensor rings at night so we can track how our breathing was. Really helps figure out what makes our breathing better or worse", "I do have to point out that if he's constantly exhausted from poor sleep, that actually can get in the way of caring for himself. Though he shouldn't blame her for his own failure.", "My own test was done at home as well. Basically I had to go to the hospital to get things fitted, then went home. Nose thingy (which you plug into your nose yourself just before you go to bed), stretchbands, measurement device on wrist with fingertip sensor. They programmed it to start recording at 9 PM and I had to turn it in before 9:30 AM.", "Nta. He's the asshole, because his snoring means he isn't breathing properly,which means his sleep is light. I other words, his snoring is taking a toll on his health.\n\nHe would have to be tested at a sleep clinic to be prescribed a CPAP, a device that makes sure you are taking in enough oxygen when you're in bed at night.\n\nDealing with this takes work ON HIS PART. You can't do it for him. But his life will improve massively if he fixes this. \n\nIncidentally, one partner's snoring is the #1 reason couples sleep in two rooms. It's a also a cause of divorce, although it can masquerade as other things (for instance, when someone's husband does not take seriously the fact that her life is chaos because she can't sleep at night).", "NTA and if he isn\u2019t willing to fox the issue then you need to do so on your end. Do you have a second bedroom you can move too?  Get a nice bed and mattress, set it up as a little haven away from the beast.", "NTA. We have had this same exact conversation with my husband several times. His sleep isn't good even if I won't wake him. He told me he will get it checked out when his work probation is over, quess who's probation just ended last week. His father and brother both have sleep apnea. Still getting him to do something about it is like pulling teeth.", "I had to record my husband before he believed me. I poke him now and he shifts. My husband could be heard in the basement when our room was upstairs.", "Absolutely NTA. It does sound like he needs a sleep study - you waking him even a couple of times a night shouldn't leave him feeling exhausted, the quality of the sleep he is getting is clearly poor. Have you got a spare bedroom? I'd recommend separate beds until he gets this sorted - that way your sleep doesn't get disrupted and he can't blame you for his poor sleep and will be forced to address the real issue. If he does have sleep apnoea you might find having your own bedrooms works for you long term.", "In this case there\u2019s nothing to be gained by asking who the AH is. This is a practical question for both of you getting good quality sleep. \n\nWhat solution would he suggest for you getting a good night\u2019s sleep? \n\nThe current set up is clearly not suiting either of you, so it should be possible to attack the issue together without attacking each other. But if you are both cranky from sleep deprivation, then you both might be lashing out at each other instead of feeling able to have a calm and rational supportive discussion. \n\nHere I might say you are probably both lacking patience and empathy because you are tired and frustrated. Not because you are AHs.", "NTA\n\nHe's probably embarrassed. Tell him you're worried he's going to stop breathing, and maybe he'll change his tune", "Whelp\u2026 this sounds like an exact recreation of my early years with my partner. \n\nI was exhausted, she was nudging, poking, kicking me all night. I literally would wake each time and apologise for snoring out of habit. \n\nI finally got a sleep test done, I was snoring due to defaults in my nose, **and** stopped breathing 40+ times an hour. \n\nI was fitted with a cpap machine, I don\u2019t snore, and I\u2019m breathing through the night. I am no longer falling asleep at the wheel!! I have more energy and also I\u2019m healing quicker when unwell/injured as everything is getting more oxygen and I\u2019m able to reach restorative sleep stage. \n\nI still need surgery for my nose, but I\u2019m on the waiting list for that. \n\nI cannot express how much of a difference it has made to my (and my partners) life. \n\nNTA - this is potentially something that could kill him (I know that sounds dramatic, but it\u2019s true). He should want to get it checked out.", "NAH\n\nHe can\u2019t help snoring, you need your sleep.\n\nI\u2019m a terrible snorer, but luckily my wife is a sound sleeper.  If she\u2019s awake she does nudge me, but i dont know it\u2019s happening and just stop.\n\nEncourage him to get it checked out or just sleep in separate rooms.", "I would rather my wife get a good night's sleep so we sleep in different rooms.  I snore loudly so she ends up going to a different room anyways so this arrangement works for both of us.  We both get sleep and our marriage is strong.  So I say NTA.", "Send him to a Oto and have it checked. It\u2019s easy to fix.", "You should sleep in separate rooms. My wife and I have done this for the past couple of years, and if anything it's strengthened our relationship because we're no longer irritating each other - me jostling her to turn over, her snoring so loud I can hear her from the other floor of our home, never mind the next pillow over.", "That scared me about it when I learned it can cause death. I encouraged my husband to get a sleep test as I thought he had apnoea. I recorded it and showed him, but he had no trouble believing me anyway as I was also at the point of nudging him and getting him to roll onto his side, not that he even always remembered that. He got a sleep study done and they found him at the high end of \u201cnormal\u201d, but because his questionnaire implied it was affecting him greatly they gave him an apap (automatic version of a cpap) anyway. It\u2019s reduced his apnoea to an average of 3.5 a night (from a previous average of 15) and he really likes it and sleeps much better now.", "So \"fun\" fact about snoring, it's not heathy. Snoring happens when the air you breath out picks up vibrations while you sleep. Since you aren't talking (please ignore if you talk in your sleep) while you sleep the vibration is coming from the air meeting obstructions in the airway. The louder you snore the worse your airways are blocked. Now light snoring may be heathy or at least not unhealthy but if it's loud enough to wake people up then that person is at increased risk of heart disease and stroke.", "You dont snore, yet.", "Yes this!!! Sleep apnea literally prevents you from getting into a specific part of the sleep cycle. So you don't get any replenishing rest and wake up feeling tired and it can also cause brain fog and irritability. We used to think my dad had anger issues and it turned out he had sleep apnea and was just so chronically tired that he'd get snappy at everything. Now he has a cpap device and he's a different person, deals with stressful situations like it's nothing and he also started working out and lost like 50 pounds because he's always wanted to but just didn't have the energy before.", "I\u2019ve tried my husband\u2019s apap, an automatic version of a cpap, it\u2019s quite nice. You don\u2019t feel anything until you breathe in. It doesn\u2019t really have anywhere to \u201cblow\u201d with the mask on. It\u2019s quite quiet when the mask is on too. I have no trouble sleeping next to him.", "It absolutely is. I was in a hotel room with 6 other people ( late teens party lol) and they all told me the next morning i woke each and every one of them up my teeth grinding was that loud. And we were all passed out sleeping not slumber party sleeping.", "And you're literally not getting enough oxygen.\n\nSo the person arguing about this instead of going to the doctor is sleep and oxygen deprived & not in control of his faculties.\n\nAsk how I know \ud83d\ude01", "could be more then your clenching your teeth that will wear it out too. grinding is pretty loud and it\u2019s hard to imagine it being silent", "What an idiot.", "My husband\u2019s sleep study was done at home. Strapped a box to his chest, a nasal cannula, oximeter on his finger, a couple of electrodes I think? It all fed into the box. He went to sleep and took all the kit back the next morning. That was it.", "Really? With all the different mask styles to choose from?", "Yeah, me too. You don't see the cameras though; you're in a dark room. Not a big deal."]}
