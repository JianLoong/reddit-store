She asked why I was still single (I haven\u2019t been dating since I was 17, or so; after leaving a \u2018long\u2019 relationship of 5 years). I told her I was more interested in working on myself at the moment, before bringing someone else into my life.\n\nShe laughed, and said \u2018So, basically you can\u2019t find anyone\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to cause a row, so left it be.\n\nShe later asked what I\u2019d look for in a guy. \nAs I told her, and my basic standards would be;\n\u2022 respect goes both ways\n\u2022 us vs the problem, not me vs you\n\u2022 likes dogs (I have three, so, obvious reasons)\n\u2022 general good hygiene\n\u2022 decent level of fitness (not necessarily aesthetic; I\u2019m heavily into the gym, and fitness, so I want someone to match this, ideally)\n\u2022 driven, and hardworking (ie. Has a goal/drive of what they want to do with their life).\n\nI told her exactly as written above; and she\u2019s burst out laughing. I was a little confused, and asked what was up.\n\nShe told me that, \u2018(I\u2019m) never going to find a guy, because (I\u2019m) asking far too much. If (I) were to lower my standards, I\u2019d find a lovely guy. The only standard should be compatibility. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t be alone for the rest of my life; because that\u2019s where (I\u2019m) heading.\u2019\n\nI told her that without standards, we\u2019d accept any sort of treatment, and I didn\u2019t think they were unreasonable.\n\nLater that evening, my brother messaged me; with a screenshot from Tinder with my photos, and \u2018my\u2019 profile; asking whether it was me, as I assume due to similar ages, and location, we\u2019d matched. I don\u2019t like the idea of dating apps at all, and my family know this.\n\nIt was a whole lot of back and forth; turns out the friend made a dating profile \u2018\u2019on my behalf\u2019\u2019 to find a good guy for me. I was absolutely fuming, and made it clear to her. She told me \u2018she was helping me out\u2019 and knew what was good for me as a friend. Besides, if I post photos on instagram, why\u2019s it different to tinder?\n\nI told her that \u2018just because all she looks for is a penis and a pulse, it doesn\u2019t mean that I do. \n\nShe\u2019s blocked me on all platforms, and won\u2019t take the profile down. \n\nWhat do I do? AITA? \nSorry for the long one!\n\nAm working through replying to everyone now.\n\nUPDATE 1- Turns out, Tinder isn\u2019t the only profile she\u2019s made. My brother and I are searching now so they can be reported. But, we\u2019ve found numerous dating profiles, instagram, twitter and Facebook. All with the exact same description and photos. I\u2019m slightly panicking now, because I think it\u2019s gone way too far. How\u2019s the best way to go about it?

I\u2019ve been with the dogs at my brother\u2019s apartment overnight, and she was threatened with police if accounts aren\u2019t removed by 10am. However, they\u2019re still active :/\n\nNot only that, my neighbour has just informed us that two separate cars pulled up on my drive yesterday, knocked at the door, no answer (obviously) and left. She has photos of the reg, but doesn\u2019t know if there were anymore. So, it\u2019s likely she\u2019s given out my address, too. We\u2019re off to the police now, and my brother has been speaking to a lawyer; because this could get really dangerous from here.

It\u2019s as if she wants to be you and is trying to use \u201chelp you find a partner\u201d as a guise to hide what she actually wants, which would be attention. \n\nAlso, your preferences weren\u2019t even all that crazy to expect from a possible life partner.

Despite being physically attractive and well educated, I had terrible self esteem and I married the first man who told me he loved me.  It was a huge mistake and the marriage only lasted two years.  By then I was 30 years old and a new lawyer.   I met and became friends with some very wise women and started working on my issues and improving my self-esteem.  I became comfortable with the idea of spending my life as a single woman.  I was single until I was 35, when I met a guy who was perfect for me.
