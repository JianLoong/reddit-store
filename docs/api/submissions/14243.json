She asked why I was still single (I haven\u2019t been dating since I was 17, or so; after leaving a \u2018long\u2019 relationship of 5 years). I told her I was more interested in working on myself at the moment, before bringing someone else into my life.\n\nShe laughed, and said \u2018So, basically you can\u2019t find anyone\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to cause a row, so left it be.\n\nShe later asked what I\u2019d look for in a guy. \nAs I told her, and my basic standards would be;\n\u2022 respect goes both ways\n\u2022 us vs the problem, not me vs you\n\u2022 likes dogs (I have three, so, obvious reasons)\n\u2022 general good hygiene\n\u2022 decent level of fitness (not necessarily aesthetic; I\u2019m heavily into the gym, and fitness, so I want someone to match this, ideally)\n\u2022 driven, and hardworking (ie. Has a goal/drive of what they want to do with their life).\n\nI told her exactly as written above; and she\u2019s burst out laughing. I was a little confused, and asked what was up.\n\nShe told me that, \u2018(I\u2019m) never going to find a guy, because (I\u2019m) asking far too much. If (I) were to lower my standards, I\u2019d find a lovely guy. The only standard should be compatibility. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t be alone for the rest of my life; because that\u2019s where (I\u2019m) heading.\u2019\n\nI told her that without standards, we\u2019d accept any sort of treatment, and I didn\u2019t think they were unreasonable.\n\nLater that evening, my brother messaged me; with a screenshot from Tinder with my photos, and \u2018my\u2019 profile; asking whether it was me, as I assume due to similar ages, and location, we\u2019d matched. I don\u2019t like the idea of dating apps at all, and my family know this.\n\nIt was a whole lot of back and forth; turns out the friend made a dating profile \u2018\u2019on my behalf\u2019\u2019 to find a good guy for me. I was absolutely fuming, and made it clear to her. She told me \u2018she was helping me out\u2019 and knew what was good for me as a friend. Besides, if I post photos on instagram, why\u2019s it different to tinder?\n\nI told her that \u2018just because all she looks for is a penis and a pulse, it doesn\u2019t mean that I do. \n\nShe\u2019s blocked me on all platforms, and won\u2019t take the profile down. \n\nWhat do I do? AITA? \nSorry for the long one!\n\nAm working through replying to everyone now.\n\nUPDATE - Turns out, Tinder isn\u2019t the only profile she\u2019s made. My brother and I are searching now so they can be reported. But, we\u2019ve found numerous dating profiles, instagram, twitter and Facebook. All with the exact same description and photos.

I'm really sorry this is happening to you, but I wish you the best", "NTA After you've reported her impersonation to every single site and filed a criminal complaint for identity theft (create the record even if there's no chance of winning), you pay a lawyer to send her a cease and desist letter and then go no contact. She's dangerous.", "Contact all the platforms to take them down. And go to the cops. This isn\u2019t just unacceptable, it\u2019s potentially dangerous.", "NTA. Your \"friend\", on the other hand....\n\nWhat you listed is basically compatibility. And not unreasonable at all really. \n\nHer behavior is beyond the pale, and absolutely major AH territory. Frankly I would be talking to lawyers and cops if this doesn't get straightened out fast.", "What the actual fuck. That's impersonation. \n\nTell the police with screenshots. Most likely they'll give her a warning, but a message from the police should give her a reality check on how fucked up what she's doing is.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" is TA. Your standards in a person are also pretty reasonable. I would say that someone could learn to go to the gym, rather than already matching your requirements.", "That\u2019s horrifying. I\u2019m so so sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. That\u2019s not a friend. NTA", "NTA and you need an upgrade in friends. Take it from watching my room mate be dragged down by friends like this in the entire year and a half I've co-rented with her, she'll do the same to you. Cut her loose, you'll be better off. Reasonable standards are reasonable", "NTA: You should absolutely have standards and a list of what your ideal partner would be. Then stick to it. A partner is not something you ought to settle on. \nTwo, you are only freaking 20 you got plenty of time to date and go towards a future relationship. I went through a good handful of abusive, rough relationships in my 20s. I did lots of therapy and made my list of perfect partner. Went on OK Cupid and met my now wife who blew my list out of the water and met every requirement ten fold. We married when I was 28, she was 37. Best damn person I met in this world. \n\n\nInfo: is she making dating profiles of you or for herself. \nMake sure you use something like CreditKarma to keep track in case she opens financial things in your name, since she knows all your personal information.", "For starters, she's catfishing any man that swipes right on those profiles. Secondly, you're 20. You're a young woman with plenty of time to work on herself before getting into a relationship. Thirdly, your standards are just fine. Reasonable, even.

This is harassment on an epic scale.", "Police report sounds in order, Maybe the accounts come down after talking to a detective", "NTA\n\nI see it as you were with someone for 5 yrs when you were in you adolescent yrs.\n\nYou have standards, and as you listed them, not unreasonable.  This as a now much older persons, standards , expectations change.\n\nIf you had your 5 yr relationship as a 20 or 30 yr old, taking a 3 yr break would not seem unreasonable.", "NTA hope you contact the police too... maybe you have a friend who could \"talk to her\"", "NTA. You should have standards, and these sound perfectly reasonable.", "NTA\n\nI would report her to the police immediately.  What she is doing is called stalking and it's illegal.", "Nta and your \u2018friend\u2019 is a creep and a catfish.", "NTA, why are you still friends with her?", "Um, your 'friend' is getting into criminal behavior here.  She's no friend, dump her asap.  I'm a widowed dad with two little girls and I admit my standards for finding someone to date are extremely high.  I've posted here before how my sis and mom are just like your friend, married and divorced 3 times with virtually no standards.  I think 'penis and a pulse' says it all.  I would urge them to do the right thing and emphasize how serious you take this.  If they don't delete those pages, I'd talk to a lawyer and have him/her send a very serious letter about it...  My wife has been gone for almost 3 years, my youngest daughter was 3.5 months when she died.  I would absolutely lose it if someone made a dating profile for me.  If and when I decide to date, she'll somehow fit my standards or I won't date.  I'm pretty okay with being by myself/friends/daughters and if I don't marry again, I'm good with it.", "NTA go to the police . This is harassment", "Go to the police and report identity theft. They will force her to take down the profiles. You are NTA.", "She sounds like the \u201cmisery loves company\u201d type.", "NTA\nThis took a real frightening turn. Sounds like she\u2019s absolutely obsessed with you. Stay safe", "NTA, I don't have the spoons to address all the aspects of this, but I created a list for my Ideal Partner with 52 points on it. The man I later found hits all those points and then some and I'm the happiest I've even been! Standards are not a bad thing to have, whether the dating is casual or serious!", "NTA, take your social media private and block her on everything.

Not Your Asshole?", "I'm betting her issue is that guys she's interested in turn their attention towards you once they find out you are single, so she wants you to find a guy to better her odds.\n\nHer behavior is straight up unhinged regardless, her standards are probably low because her personality can't bring in nicer fish in the sea.", "Then who's asshole is it?", "You need more upvotes", "Yup. This is my bet, too.", " it could indeed be a crime. Please call them, and at least ask what they suggest.", "Also file for a restraining order", "This could count as a form of stalking, though, with a side order of harassment.", "Also, even if your standards were absolutely over the top insane to the point that no actual human being could ever.", "Make sure you go to the police.

You don't need her in your life.", "File a police report anyway. Just to have it on record. This could be construed as identity theft regardless of what her motives are. Can you move and change your phone number? Because this is unhinged behavior on her part and calls into question her judgment. Good luck sorting it out.\n\nNTA.", "r/legaladvice"]}
