She asked why I was still single (I haven\u2019t been dating since I was 17, or so; after leaving a \u2018long\u2019 relationship of 5 years). I told her I was more interested in working on myself at the moment, before bringing someone else into my life.\n\nShe laughed, and said \u2018So, basically you can\u2019t find anyone\u2019. I didn\u2019t want to cause a row, so left it be.\n\nShe later asked what I\u2019d look for in a guy. \nAs I told her, and my basic standards would be;\n\u2022 respect goes both ways\n\u2022 us vs the problem, not me vs you\n\u2022 likes dogs (I have three, so, obvious reasons)\n\u2022 general good hygiene\n\u2022 decent level of fitness (not necessarily aesthetic; I\u2019m heavily into the gym, and fitness, so I want someone to match this, ideally)\n\u2022 driven, and hardworking (ie. Has a goal/drive of what they want to do with their life).\n\nI told her exactly as written above; and she\u2019s burst out laughing. I was a little confused, and asked what was up.\n\nShe told me that, \u2018(I\u2019m) never going to find a guy, because (I\u2019m) asking far too much. If (I) were to lower my standards, I\u2019d find a lovely guy. The only standard should be compatibility. If I did, I wouldn\u2019t be alone for the rest of my life; because that\u2019s where (I\u2019m) heading.\u2019\n\nI told her that without standards, we\u2019d accept any sort of treatment, and I didn\u2019t think they were unreasonable.\n\nLater that evening, my brother messaged me; with a screenshot from Tinder with my photos, and \u2018my\u2019 profile; asking whether it was me, as I assume due to similar ages, and location, we\u2019d matched. I don\u2019t like the idea of dating apps at all, and my family know this.\n\nIt was a whole lot of back and forth; turns out the friend made a dating profile \u2018\u2019on my behalf\u2019\u2019 to find a good guy for me. I was absolutely fuming, and made it clear to her. She told me \u2018she was helping me out\u2019 and knew what was good for me as a friend. Besides, if I post photos on instagram, why\u2019s it different to tinder?\n\nI told her that \u2018just because all she looks for is a penis and a pulse, it doesn\u2019t mean that I do. \n\nShe\u2019s blocked me on all platforms, and won\u2019t take the profile down. \n\nWhat do I do? AITA? \nSorry for the long one!\n\nAm working through replying to everyone now.\n\nUPDATE - Turns out, Tinder isn\u2019t the only profile she\u2019s made.
