You brother should also respect your opinion. Maybe if you sat him down and tried to calmly explain yourself you might have a better chance of convincing him.", "NTA. She disrespected your stuff and insulted you. Your mom and brother suck.", "NTA - Woah, slow down. She could have *broken* the collection you had. Thankfully, she didn\u2019t, but you need to take that seriously. If she continues coming over, something else could happen to your musical box collection.\n\nOn another note, your brother and mother are siding with her because it wasn\u2019t enough time to get to know her?

That whole interaction was a red flag festival.", ">You're too young to be collecting ugly music boxes, can I sell it for you?

It really shows that your brother cares more about a stranger he's known for 3 months than his own sister. This may very well be the dynamic for the rest of your life, so be very careful.
