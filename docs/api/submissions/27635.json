If that means ordering pizza and ducking out of the delivery room every hour to phone the twins and make sure they\u2019re ok, also good.

Going into labor early which I do not see how early in the post can be a terrifying experience for the mother, partner, and family. In the facilities I have worked at, you are allowed a certain number of people in the room with you to support you (even less if the facility still has Covid restrictions in place). The people in that room are there to help support you.

Or they may have assumed that, if their sister went into labour when it was dad's weekend with them, he would pick them up, and they would get to wait at the hospital with the rest of the family.\n\nIt also sounds like, out of a two week/14 day period, OP has them for about 2 of those days.

So they may have thought that she'd probably have the baby when they were with their mom, and then they'd get to see the baby when they were with dad.\n\nFor heaven's sake, he's not going to be IN the room when she gives birth, so he probably would have time to go pick up the twins and bring them. They're 12, not 4...they could have entertained themselves in the hospital waiting room.\n\nOP should have, at the very least, spoken to the twins, and explained \"hey, your big sister is in labour! I need to be there to support her during this, but after she has the baby, I'll come get you, and bring you to the hospital to meet your niece/nephew!\"", "Yeah but I feel it's different to ask your co-parent to take that responsibility than to just announce to them that they will deal with it and go silent. I understand why he put his phone on silent, but it doesn't look like he tried to make an arrangement, he just left them there.", "This is what I was thinking. The twins are sibs to to the new mom, and old enough to be at home on their own with a neighbor checking in. Acting like they were in the way, and just refusing to parent, was wrong. Parents don\u2019t get to stop parenting bc a sib needs help. Did he even ask the twins if they would like to be at his home even if he could not spend as much time with them? It sounds like he just abandoned them. And Stacy gets left trying to explain that to them. \n\nHad he made arrangements and prepped his kids better, this would be a non-issue. They may be excited about the new baby and feel bewildered and hurt being left out of a family event.\n\nI feel bad for the twins. OP, YTA.", "Exactly. He had several months notice that alternative arrangements might be necessary. And alternative arrangements shouldn't be difficult or complicated.\n\nInstead of dealing with that, he told his Ex that he wasn't going to take the kids when he was expected to, and then put his phone on silent.\n\nThat isn't a reaosnable way of dealing with the situation. OP is YTA for both leaving it so late to make plans, and for unilatiraly dumping his responsibilities onto someone else and then ignoring his phone so there couldn't be any kind of conversation.", "My sister was 12 when I was in labor. She was just outside my room.  Best teenage pregnancy deterrent ever! She heard me struggling for hours, came in to meet her neice and said she was never having sex because labor is awful.", "Also they're 12 and can probably be home by themselves for a couple hours.", "At 12 they can easily sit at home alone while they\u2019re at the hospital during labor.\n\nOP just showed them how low they are in the pecking order.", "They're 12 not 2. There is no reason theycoildnt have been there also.", "And what if the twins were his current wifes?  What would he do then?  The exact same thing he should be doing now, either leaving them home alone (they\u2019re old enough) or with or sitter.", "No one is saying he shouldn't prioritize his oldest child. But, he still has parental responsibility for his twins. He does not get to peace out. He needs to make arrangements.", "Yeah this was literally a medical emergency. It would have been better if he'd made an emergency plan but come on.", "And his duty to his two other children? What about that?", "And you need a little reading comprehension. He takes them every weekend, and he also takes them when their mother is sick. He has a little bit of leeway.", "I\u2019m gonna guess the mother didn\u2019t just dump the kids on OPs doorstep and then disappear when she got \u201ccalled in\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s fine to want the other parent to be flexible but it\u2019s still a *conversation*.", "Oh my god yes you are absolutely each other's social support system for the childcare of the children you co-parent. As long as they're not 18, you swallow your ego and help each other out in emergencies for the sake of your children. If you don't do that you absolutely suck as co-parents and take out your frustrations on the children.", "The term in divorce is \u201cright of first refusal\u201d, the other parent is asked first. Either way, 12 yr olds can stay alone without burning the house down.", "Technically Stacy only went through it once since they were twins.", "How early was this labor? I\u2019m not sure if she was 37 weeks or 28 weeks.\n\nHe\u2019s had multiple kids. They had zero plans in place? Like come on. She was pregnant. No one plans for early labor but it should be something that is discussed and arrangements made in the event something happens?! Did he have \u201con time\u201d labor plans?", "What\u2019s the difference between early labor and regular labor? What was his plan if it was regular labor on the weekend?\n\nSounds like he didn\u2019t plan for a weekend birth at all. There\u2019s a 30% chance of a weekend birth. He always going to leave the trains with his ex.", "Personally, I wouldn't want to attend  my family member giving birth.  I would pass out in my own vomit in a minute.", "What exactly is his presence going to prevent that he can\u2019t take 10 minutes to have an actual conversation with the mother of his other kids to work out a solution or explain better than \u201cI can\u2019t take them this weekend, bye!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m pretty confident that it was not a medical emergency type birth considering he was more worried about *being there* for the birth, not for her life.", "She probably wouldn\u2019t have that attitude if he'd actually thought ahead and had an actual conversation with her ahead of time.", "I don't think anyone is skipping that. I'm also not backing her on that part either. I can blame her for her words while understanding her frustration. Medical emergencies can be a pass for things like this but it can be hectic to not have a plan in place then bam plan needed. It's the lack of preplanning on op's part that I don't like. Now, with that being said, Stacy could have easily asked op \"hey, what's your plan in case x goes into labor on your time?\" But why didn't op say something? It's his and his wife's daughter after all.", "I appreciate you sharing your POV with me. Thank you.", "\u274c\ufe0fStandard\n\n\u2705\ufe0fExpedited", "Haha no. I ended up with an emergency c-section because the baby was in distress and stuck.", "I really don't think you've ever had kids. You gotta cut the man some slack, his twins were perfectly fine.", "It's not exactly like she was hit by a bus or something that nobody could have foreseen.   She was pregnant.  They knew she was pregnant.  She was far enough along to give birth to (I assume) a viable baby.\n\nGoing into labor early is a distinct possibility.  Some general plans/agreement should have been made well in advance.   When my wife and I had our kids, we had at least rough contingency plans in place months ahead - especially with our second kid.  We organized with friends who were willing to look after our daughter if they were around, we knew which friends wouldn't be around, etc.  The same happened with friends when they had their kids.  Simple, basic communication of what we expected we could potentially need.\n\nThere should have been, at the very least a \"Hey, just in case something happens and she goes into labor on one of my weekends, I'm going to need you take care of the twins, and that could happen unexpectedly.  You OK with that?  Or do we need to discuss this more?\"\n\nThat's not to say the ex-wife didn't react poorly as well.  It's a failure all around here.", "Labour in a pregnant person is not exactly unexpected. OP had few months to talk to his ex wife about the possibility that his daughter gives birth on his weekend. This is what all people in the comment go on about,when they say he should have had plans in place.", "The baby was gonna come out sometime, he had *months* to discuss with his ex what they\u2019d do if an emergency came up related to the pregnancy when it was his turn with the kids. What if she\u2019d been having a bad miscarriage instead? Pregnancies having problems isn\u2019t all that unusual, failing to plan for the possibility of problems is just stupid.", "Like the fact ex complained that he was prioritising his teenage daughter\u2019s medical emergency over one weekend\u2014 a missed weekend that doesn\u2019t seem to be part of an overarching pattern\u2014 is insane. Yes maybe he should have had contingencies in place, yes maybe he shouldn\u2019t have silenced his phone (but this could have been hospital protocol! it\u2019s also good manners to have your phone on silence in such delicate situations anyway!) but the fact is that her gripe was that her children were delegated to the lower wrung. Birth itself is scary. Early birth, scarier. Early birth as a *teenager*? Who isn\u2019t yet an adult and would need parental support as well as needing them to possibly make some tough decisions in her stead? \n\nNo contest.", "Agree. It\u2019s the conversation.", "Yes. To make things even more YTA, unless his daughter was being induced or having a scheduled C-section, the expected date is just an estimate. She could have gone into labor normally at full term and it could have happened on a weekend or not. There would still be no way to predict it. Since OP has kids he is responsible for, it was on him to have a plan for who would watch them if his oldest went into labor on a weekend. It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019d even discussed with his ex about that. It would be the normal, responsible thing to do to communicate with his ex and ask if she would be willing to be on standby to take the kids if his daughter went into labor on the weekends around her due date, then make other arrangements if not, but it seems he didn\u2019t even do that much. This is not a novel idea. People who have multiple kids all had to make this kind of plan. You need some people that you have arranged with ahead of time to watch your older kids, even in the middle of the night with no notice. His two youngest were an afterthought to him. He didn\u2019t make a happy-path plan, let alone an emergency plan.", "I agree OP didn't behave responsibly. There's obviously a lot of pettiness between these two. I was just asking in the general sense.", "Op is definitely the asshole. Shows how well he parents with a pregnant teenager so him just dropping the other children he shouldn\u2019t have had on his ex wife doesn\u2019t surprise me honestly", "FROR isn\u2019t the default. A lot of people don\u2019t want it because it can be abused in high conflict situations where a parent is unreasonable for the sake of being unreasonable. For example, parent could be held in contempt for letting child have a sleepover with grandma because other parent should have been offered that time first.", "I find people are a lot more willing when they're not getting the rug pulled out from under them; especially when its followed immediately by being ignored.", "That's largely because the parent who has the kids a lot less wants first dibs to have more time with them than anything else, then it's just fair play if that applies to both parents.\n\nBut ultimately, she could also be having an emergency, or a one off thing she plans for her time off. She might work full time at weekends and have her job risked to suddenly have no back up and have to watch the kids while she should be working or she planned an important job interview for the weekend that he ruins with just stating he isn't going to be there.\n\nBut the truly important part is first dibs, meaning you call them and ask them if they want to take them or if they have plans and you need to call someone else. He didn't do that part, he just told her you're taking them and muted his phone.", "First dibs is also called a first right of refusal, which implies you also get the right to refuse if taking the kids doesn't actually work for you. \n\nWhat he did wasn't giving her first dibs. It was telling her he wasn't going to make arrangements for the kids and she had to, and them muting her for the rest of the day rather than asking her if it was something she was even able to do", "This is normally how it works.

Not 9 months emergency not known...", "In response to the actual post, OP should have had plans and back-up plans for if the labor did happen to be early, or late, or whatever. Pregnancies can be unpredictable, and OP shouldn't have waited until the last minute to talk to Stacy about potential plans.\n\nSince the person you're responding to asked about emergencies in general, you can't just expect a delivery to happen smoothly and easily on exactly the date the doctor predicted. Sure, it probably will, but saying you had 9 months warning is over-simplifying the issue.", "It really depends on if OP is being truthful about premature or not. 37 weeks is term, but not everyone knows that. \n\nOn the other hand, birthing can be an extremely dangerous process. You can have an emergency delivery on your due date. There are so many things that can go wrong and kill mom/baby.", "The ex didn\u2019t want op to leave them with a sitter though. She insisted that he miss the birth of his grandchild and not be there for his oldest in a medical emergency so he could sit at home and spend time with their twins. That isn\u2019t reasonable. I think ESH.", "Im confused. His twins are 12. Not babies or toddlers or young children. 12 year olds don\u2019t need babysitters. Why are childcare arrangements such an issue? I mean in reality, it sucks but they\u2019re literally just going to scroll through their phones or play video games or watch tv or whatever at their moms house this weekend instead of doing that at dads. What is the big deal? It\u2019s not like mom or dad would need to cater and tend to them all day long. 12 is pretty self sufficient. Dad should get a little slack. His 17 YO is having a baby and he\u2019s probably not thinking clearly. Still not the coolest that he left a message then ditched his phone but in the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s certainly not the worst thing a parent has ever done and it\u2019s not something he does regularly. Everyone crucifying him needs to take a step back.", "The ex is saying he shouldn't have prioritzed his eldest. It's not like he left them at home alone twiddling their thumbs unfed. He left them with their mother and she could have very reasonably asked \"okay, can you take them another weekend then?\" If he stepped up to take them when she was sick, surely she can handle trading weekends or giving him extra time down the line.", "My 12 year old niece can stay at home alone. Why the f can't they.", "This!", "Yes, but the other parent can refuse -- it is the other parent's right, not their obligation.", "Its a medical emergency, who knows when they would arrive back home.", "Right. You have to ask first. They have the right to say No", "Early labor is usually unexpected. Regular labor you can prepare a bit more..", "Premature is born before 37 weeks of gestation. So, if the baby was born at 30 weeks, nobody would have had a lot of plans in place for it.", "Right, people are acting like a full term labour is scheduled in to the minute. Most people don't know what day they're going to give birth unless they're being induced or a planned c-section so everyone with other kids needs some semblance of an idea of what they will do to arrange care for those kids.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I'm not sure why she would have an attitude at all if OP is in the hospital with his daughter during a major medical event.

I mean he only has his kids 4 days out of what 30/31 days each month. How about the mom that does the bulk of raising the children day in and day out to accommodate dad's work schedule be cut some slack. Sounds like mom is sick of his shit and I would not be surprised if he has bailed out on weekends before for other things.", ">  Yes maybe he should have had contingencies in place\n\nIf it was close to term, yes. But for an early birth, I don't think this is fair. When our second baby got close to term, we had of course planned for someone to watch the first one. But if it would have been much earlier (don't know how early OP's grandchild was), we wouldn't have had a solid backup plan either. We probably would have taken the first one with us to hospital and on the way called the grandparents to please drop everything and pick up the first child or something like that.\n\n> yes maybe he shouldn\u2019t have silenced his phone\n\nTbh, he was totally right to silence his phone. If you are the support person for a birth, you silence your phone or better turn it off. You are required to be 100% present, and not on the phone negotiating someone to watch over the other kids if someone is already watching them, but just doesn't want to.", "How early is early? Some people may not really plan on 6 months, or 7.", "The \"she cheated\" note is a red flag ... the note is at least 14 years in the past and has nothing to do with the current situation.

Mom could have plans that she paid in advance for and is now out of the money. Mom could just want dad to have to handle his own emergencies like she does. We didn't get her side, and this complete lack of respect, which may be normal, doesn't mean it isn't asshole behavior.", "Because certain part time parents think they can just... not be a parent when it's not convenient for them. That's what op did. He didn't make arrangements for his kids, he left that to their mom to do. People with that type of attitude tend to be the \"not my problem\" type of parent. They just don't show up when they are supposed to because *reasons*. But then they also tend to not be available/ willing to \"help\" the default parent out when the need arises. I'm sure the ex is pissed at the complete lack of communication and the expectation that she will handle childcare. It was 100% OPs job to talk to ex and see if she could/ wanted to keep the kids and if not, to arrange childcare.
