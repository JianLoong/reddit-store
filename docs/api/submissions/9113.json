{"id": 9113, "submission_id": "10tjehi", "title": "Update: WIBTA For Booting my Brother From My Wedding?", "selftext": "So after reading through the comments, I thought I'd give an update. First, thank you everyone that commented. This has been a sore spot for me for a while now. I got married 3 weeks ago and I'm the happiest I've ever been. The ceremony was beautiful and we had an amazing time. My brother was not in it, nor did he attend. So, here's what happened:\n\nI spoke to my brother about his accusations and he proceeded to act like nothing happened and that he did nothing wrong. Essentially just trying to brush it under the rug. Over Christmas he, his wife, and my niece came to our mom's house for a little while and the tension was so high that we barely spoke. The day after Christmas, he texted me asking if he and his wife were still invited to the wedding. I told him, \"If you can rectify and apologize for the situation with mom then yes.\" He then replied with, \"Well then we're not going cause I don't have anything to apologize for.\" This hurt so much and I haven't talked to him since.\n\n I don't know where this is going to go or if I'll ever see my niece outside of holidays again. Again, thank you all so much for your advice. I know it isn't much of an update, but it has been a big weight that I've been slowly getting past since it all happened. Have a great day.", "created_utc": 1675525477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tjehi/update_wibta_for_booting_my_brother_from_my/", "score": 1230, "replies": ["This is sad. His dad must have really poisoned him against your mom for him to be destroying his family just to make her the bad guy. \n\nHe needs therapy.", "I'm sorry it went that way.  I'm glad you have been able to find some piece.  There's a quote I once heard that seems to fit your situation.  \"You can't logic a person out of a belief they didn't logic themselves into.\"", "Link to original post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z21a8x/wibta\\_for\\_booting\\_my\\_brother\\_from\\_my\\_wedding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z21a8x/wibta_for_booting_my_brother_from_my_wedding/)", "I didn\u2019t see the original until now but I empathize with your bro. I\u2019m not sure why your wedding had to be the place for this last stand, but congrats on your marriage and best of luck.\n\nEdit for the downvoters: whether OP believes/knows something to be true doesn\u2019t affect bro\u2019s belief that something else is true. OP shouldn\u2019t have used the wedding to strong arm bro into accepting a different reality lest he be disinvited. OP had the right to exclude bro if that\u2019s what he wanted, and the right to ask him to play nice at the wedding, but if bro believes this to his core, the ultimatum didn\u2019t force any change in that\u2026only resulted in more alienation now with OP. So yeah, I empathize with the bro.", "[deleted]", "I fully agree", "Truer facts have not been spoken. Thank you", "Thank you so much", "I remember my life at 10 years of age. Especially the major moments like my parents divorce and the reason behind it. Fast-forward to NOW...4 years after divorcing my first husband he started a rumor that I left him for my second husband. I know we want to believe the bs cause it makes it easier than accepting some ppl just start lies and rumors for their own sick reasons.", "You said in the first post that your brother felt he had to get married because his wife was pregnant. Was your mom pregnant when she married his Dad? It seems possible from the timeline and you mentioned family pressure and that they weren't in love.\n\nThis is pure speculation, but maybe your brother would rather think that the divorce was because your mom cheated than accept that things weren't right from the beginning because that makes him feel more secure about his own marriage. Was your mom supportive of their decision to get married?", "A huge indicator of maturity, integrity, consideration for others, and whether or not someone is a good person is whether or not they apologize when asked. \n\nApologizing doesn't mean we think we are 100% wrong or that we need to grovel. It means we are sorry everything got messy, we won't do it again, we know it will help the recipient heal, and it will help mend things and re-create peace again for everyone affected. \n\nSo to let ones pride get in the way is terribly selfish and immature and hurtful to all affected by the rift.", "Thank you for this!", "My mom wasn't pregnant when she married his dad. They had him about a year after the fact. And yes she was supportive of my brother and his wife's marriage. Though she was hesitant and assured him that they didn't have to get married yet, she was supportive because it was what they wanted.", "I absolutely agree", "But his truth is a lie. It\u2019s not true. He has heard the truth from multiple people and still doesn\u2019t believe anyone. It\u2019s not somewhere where you think it\u2019s blue and I think it\u2019s marine. He\u2019s continuing on with a lie and will not accept the truth. \n\nThis is how anti vaxxers were born. From a lie.", "Am I understanding that he's still coming to your mom's Christmas even though he continually keeps accusing her of adultery? What exactly is he expecting/wanting here?  He has no proof everyone's telling him opposite...he really does need therapy.", "How would a 10 year old have any knowledge of what may or may not have happened privately between coworkers?\n\nEdit: Not sure why everyone is so butthurt. My comment clearly said \"may or may not have happened\". That is a neutral statement but it's still true that a 10 year old would know nothing about their mom's private life.", "I have no idea. Honestly, he just kinda showed up. No one knew he was coming", "He needs serious therapy because multiple people told him \"no this isn't happening\" and he still believes his dad.  He believes to the point where he's about to isolate his family and ruin relationships over it", "I'm sorry you went through that.  Bear in mind that people like your brother, who decide the facts first and then bend everything in the world around to support their \"facts\" will continue to do this, and will eventually do this to you.  Best to get the boundaries set now.", "[removed]", "That's the weird part, according to the original post it was just a random coworker who told him that, not even his dad.", "I can't tell if this is a comment bot or you're having comprehension issues so you're repeating key points from the OP - on multiple AITA posts", "The guy turned out to be a psycho i think many kids would remember if there had been any cheating because the dude would have likely outed her out of his own jealous mind and i think that would have stuck out like a sore thumb", "It's not just his word though, almost EVERYONE in their lives is denying it. Some random coworker isn't gonna know better than them.", "I'm not sure if I clarified earlier, but the person that told him lives in the same area as his dad", "He most likely wanted to believe it as it gives him a \"better\" reason than his mom never loving his dad as the reason for their marriage ending. He probably resented his mom for ending it for years, but could never vocalize it without seeming unempathic and cold. Now the perfect reason to blame her is dropped in his lap and he latched onto it hard. I wouldn't doubt daddy isn't whispering in his ear either as he wasn't mentioned as denying it by OP.", "But that\u2019s not the point. The point is he believes it to be true. So no amount of ultimatum is going to change that. The bro needs therapy. And that\u2019s why I empathize with him. Maybe his dad was the one to start this shit, and accepting the truth means he had to acknowledge his dad lied to him and caused all this shit. Family shit isn\u2019t easy to unpack and it\u2019s not so black and white.\n\nOr maybe the random person who told this to him was right and OP and everyone else is wrong. At the end of the day, an affair is not something that\u2019s broadcasted, so who knows? Yeah, yeah, OP was 10 and knows the real story\u2026but there\u2019s a lot of shit that I\u2019ve done in a day that my then-10 year old would have no idea about. \n\nAnd it\u2019s funny how saying I empathize with someone means I\u2019m downvoted to oblivion. But Reddit\u2019s gonna Reddit.", "It's not just OP though, almost EVERY adult at the time denies it too.", "I'm honestly shocked he even wanted to be at your mom's place, given what he now thinks of her and how he's treated her. I'm also amazed that your mother let him in; she would absolutely have been justified in slamming the door in his face.", "You were NTA then and also NTA now\n\ncongratulations on your wedding.  Try to put your brother and his weird ideas out of your head and your life.  Sooner or later there would have been some issue with him messing up your happiness.  Sorry to be rude,  but he sounds like a self centred jerk.", "Thank you so much!", "Wouldn't the coworker know better tho? Like he was at the workplace when cee and ops mom was there. Where she confided in him. Maybe like the mom dated Cee after the divorce, even if there was nothing physical till after that's definitely emotional cheating.", "Wow, just went through their comment history, and yeah, it\u2019s really annoying and weird!", "I mean the proof is she dated cee after. Like that all the proof most people would need.", "Yep, and he better hope no one makes a false accusation against him since he is burning any hope of support in the process.  I wish you well OP, dealing with the terminally wrong is a pain.", "Do you think he could be having mental health issues? Has he been behaving strangely otherwise?", "I'd be surprised if he wasn't honestly with everything he's done and been through", "My comment clearly said \"may or may not have happened\". That is a neutral statement.", "That's even weirder. I hope he gets the therapy he needs before his issues screw up his kid.", "So he could sit and exude self-righteousness in her general vicinity. Like how you have to be in someone's space to give them the silent treatment, because how else will they know you're not talking to them?\n\nAnd so he could make a play at being the 'bigger person', despite running around dredging up 20 year old drama that he's only barely connected to.", "Thank you for the update. I'm glad the wedding went well but sorry things turned out the way they did with your brother. It's unfortunate he has this obsession. You did the only reasonable thing you could. Good luck.", "When a person believes in something, they can't know it. You know the ground is real, and you know gravity exists. They can both be verified by your personal knowing and objective, scientifically proven truths. \n\nBelief systems only require the subjective side of that equation, and no amount of truths will convince a believer to discard what they hold fast. \n\nI understand where you are coming from 100%. I have a brother who has some horribly toxic traits, so I keep him at arms length, as it is what is best for my peace. \n\nI am glad you are finding yours, too. And congratulations!!!", "In the original post, the dad is not the source of the accusation.  \nThough I agree that the brother needs therapy, we must be careful when assigning blame or we are no better than OP's brother.", "Sometimes people need a 'reason' and \"not being in love\" just isn't good enough. A tangible reason, \"mum cheated on dad\" will 'explain' everything. Now there is a reason why the marriage failed, there is a bad guy to blame, and less confusion to why the family was broken apart.\n\nHe is still TA for accusing family members, but the divorce sounds like it may have caused more emotional damage than anyone realized.", "It kind of sounds like he wanted her to be his mom too but when it didn't work out his dad probably got in his ear trash talking your mom and he needed a reason to hate her and make her the villain in his story so he could finally have a concrete reason to hate her rightfully without it being his own trauma which has nothing to do with you all", "You're the asshole", "I'm sorry this is how it played out.  Don't know how old your niece is, but since you mentioned her, it seems like she's important to you.  If that's the case, I would encourage you to find some way (social media, depending on her age?) to stay in touch with her since your brother seems to have a tenuous relationship with reality.  Maybe at minimum make sure she has your number/email written down and let her know that you will always welcome her.  If he's as toxic as you describe, she will eventually see him for what he is.", "It kind of sounds like he wanted her to be his mom too but when it didn't work out his dad probably got in his ear trash talking your mom and he needed a reason to hate her and make her the villain in his story so he could finally have a concrete reason to hate her rightfully without it being his own trauma which has nothing to do with you all", "It kind of sounds like he wanted her to be his mom too but when it didn't work out his dad probably got in his ear trash talking your mom and he needed a reason to hate her and make her the villain in his story so he could finally have a concrete reason to hate her rightfully without it being his own trauma which has nothing to do with you all", "You made the right call. Glad you enjoyed your special day, drama free. Can't believe he treats your mum like that.", "Care to explain?", "The mum is both of theirs. They\u2019re half siblings."]}
