First, thank you everyone that commented. This has been a sore spot for me for a while now. I got married 3 weeks ago and I'm the happiest I've ever been. The ceremony was beautiful and we had an amazing time. My brother was not in it, nor did he attend. So, here's what happened:\n\nI spoke to my brother about his accusations and he proceeded to act like nothing happened and that he did nothing wrong. Essentially just trying to brush it under the rug. Over Christmas he, his wife, and my niece came to our mom's house for a little while and the tension was so high that we barely spoke. The day after Christmas, he texted me asking if he and his wife were still invited to the wedding. I told him, \"If you can rectify and apologize for the situation with mom then yes.\" He then replied with, \"Well then we're not going cause I don't have anything to apologize for.\" This hurt so much and I haven't talked to him since.\n\n I don't know where this is going to go or if I'll ever see my niece outside of holidays again. Again, thank you all so much for your advice. I know it isn't much of an update, but it has been a big weight that I've been slowly getting past since it all happened. Have a great day.", "created_utc": 1675525477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tjehi/update_wibta_for_booting_my_brother_from_my/", "score": 182, "replies": ["This is sad. His dad must have really poisoned him against your mom for him to be destroying his family just to make her the bad guy. \n\nHe needs therapy.", "I'm sorry it went that way.  I'm glad you have been able to find some piece.  There's a quote I once heard that seems to fit your situation.  \"You can't logic a person out of a belief they didn't logic themselves into.\"", "Link to original post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z21a8x/wibta\\_for\\_booting\\_my\\_brother\\_from\\_my\\_wedding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z21a8x/wibta_for_booting_my_brother_from_my_wedding/)", "I didn\u2019t see the original until now but I empathize with your bro. I\u2019m not sure why your wedding had to be the place for this last stand, but congrats on your marriage and best of luck.\n\nEdit for the downvoters: whether OP believes/knows something to be true doesn\u2019t affect bro\u2019s belief that something else is true. OP shouldn\u2019t have used the wedding to strong arm bro into accepting a different reality lest he be disinvited. OP had the right to exclude bro if that\u2019s what he wanted, and the right to ask him to play nice at the wedding, but if bro believes this to his core, the ultimatum didn\u2019t force any change in that\u2026only resulted in more alienation now with OP. So yeah, I empathize with the bro.", "How are you so sure that they didn\u2019t have an affair? You were a kid too, you were like 10 when the divorce happened. Do you really think you had a firm grasp on what was happening? \n\nI think it\u2019s foolish for you to claim that you \u201cremember the whole ordeal\u201d when you were a prepubescent kid who probably had no clue about the true extent of the adults\u2019 doings.", "I fully agree", "Truer facts have not been spoken. Thank you", "Thank you so much", "I remember my life at 10 years of age. Especially the major moments like my parents divorce and the reason behind it. Fast-forward to NOW...4 years after divorcing my first husband he started a rumor that I left him for my second husband. I know we want to believe the bs cause it makes it easier than accepting some ppl just start lies and rumors for their own sick reasons.", "You said in the first post that your brother felt he had to get married because his wife was pregnant. Was your mom pregnant when she married his Dad? It seems possible from the timeline and you mentioned family pressure and that they weren't in love.\n\nThis is pure speculation, but maybe your brother would rather think that the divorce was because your mom cheated than accept that things weren't right from the beginning because that makes him feel more secure about his own marriage. Was your mom supportive of their decision to get married?", "A huge indicator of maturity, integrity, consideration for others, and whether or not someone is a good person is whether or not they apologize when asked. \n\nApologizing doesn't mean we think we are 100% wrong or that we need to grovel. It means we are sorry everything got messy, we won't do it again, we know it will help the recipient heal, and it will help mend things and re-create peace again for everyone affected. \n\nSo to let ones pride get in the way is terribly selfish and immature and hurtful to all affected by the rift.", "Thank you for this!", "My mom wasn't pregnant when she married his dad. They had him about a year after the fact. And yes she was supportive of my brother and his wife's marriage. Though she was hesitant and assured him that they didn't have to get married yet, she was supportive because it was what they wanted.", "I absolutely agree", "But his truth is a lie. It\u2019s not true. He has heard the truth from multiple people and still doesn\u2019t believe anyone. It\u2019s not somewhere where you think it\u2019s blue and I think it\u2019s marine. He\u2019s continuing on with a lie and will not accept the truth. \n\nThis is how anti vaxxers were born. From a lie.", "Am I understanding that he's still coming to your mom's Christmas even though he continually keeps accusing her of adultery? What exactly is he expecting/wanting here?  He has no proof everyone's telling him opposite...he really does need therapy.", "How would a 10 year old have any knowledge of what may or may not have happened privately between coworkers?", "I have no idea. Honestly, he just kinda showed up. No one knew he was coming"]}
