First, thank you everyone that commented. This has been a sore spot for me for a while now. I got married 3 weeks ago and I'm the happiest I've ever been. The ceremony was beautiful and we had an amazing time. My brother was not in it, nor did he attend. So, here's what happened:\n\nI spoke to my brother about his accusations and he proceeded to act like nothing happened and that he did nothing wrong. Essentially just trying to brush it under the rug. Over Christmas he, his wife, and my niece came to our mom's house for a little while and the tension was so high that we barely spoke. The day after Christmas, he texted me asking if he and his wife were still invited to the wedding. I told him, \"If you can rectify and apologize for the situation with mom then yes.\" He then replied with, \"Well then we're not going cause I don't have anything to apologize for.\" This hurt so much and I haven't talked to him since.\n\n I don't know where this is going to go or if I'll ever see my niece outside of holidays again. Again, thank you all so much for your advice. I know it isn't much of an update, but it has been a big weight that I've been slowly getting past since it all happened. Have a great day.", "created_utc": 1675525477, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10tjehi/update_wibta_for_booting_my_brother_from_my/", "score": 35, "replies": ["This is sad.

I\u2019m not sure why your wedding had to be the place for this last stand, but congrats on your marriage and best of luck.", "How are you so sure that they didn\u2019t have an affair? You were a kid too, you were like 10 when the divorce happened. Do you really think you had a firm grasp on what was happening? \n\nI think it\u2019s foolish for you to claim that you \u201cremember the whole ordeal\u201d when you were a prepubescent kid who probably had no clue about the true extent of the adults\u2019 doings.", "I fully agree", "Truer facts have not been spoken. Thank you", "Thank you so much", "I remember my life at 10 years of age. Especially the major moments like my parents divorce and the reason behind it. Fast-forward to NOW...4 years after divorcing my first husband he started a rumor that I left him for my second husband. I know we want to believe the bs cause it makes it easier than accepting some ppl just start lies and rumors for their own sick reasons."]}
