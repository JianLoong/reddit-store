This was a complete surprise to me, and I\u2019m still in shock. I initially learned about this through rumors within our community, and I found the rumors to be ridiculous. I shared the rumors with my husband and he fully denied, I thought that was the end of it. A family member (who was unaware of any of the prior rumors) then shared information with me that they witnessed my husbands infidelity, and I asked him about it again, which he again denied. This time, I felt there was too much to ignore and I went into detective mode asking those who had shared the rumors what they knew, and eventually confronted the affair partner who confirmed everything with verified proof (texts, pictures). I was devastated, and I reached out the several friends for support and shared the details of the affair. My husband finally admitted everything, but is upset that I confirmed the rumors within our community and he feels he has completely lost his reputation. He has expressed shame and remorse, and it\u2019s worth noting that his profession is tied to some in our community that are now aware of his infidelity. I do feel bad about so many people knowing, but honestly, I though everyone already knew from the fact that apparently this had been rumored for months to a year, and I was honestly looking for support, not trying to vilify him. But it is clear that was a possible result of me talking to people. We have kids and I would hate to be the reason they ever find out about the extent of his cheating.

He doesn't get to dictate how you tell your story or to whom you tell it.", "NTA. If his profession could be destroyed by the news of him having an affair, then he should have thought of that before he had one. This is entirely his doing - him blaming you for this is his attempt to try to shift blame from himself and onto you. He may be making a show of remorse, but he isn\u2019t taking responsibility for his actions, so I would not believe him. \n\nAnd, the next time he accuses you of this, point out that you found out because the rumors were already being spread- the damage was already done. \n\nAs far as the kids finding out - again, that is on him. The truth is out there, you can only hide this from them for so long.", "The intrepid adulterer boldly fucks around, finds out, and is now upset that his actions have consequences?

He was also so obvious about it that everyone in the community already knew or had their suspicions; he did this all to himself. He\u2019s just trying one last chance to gaslight you so you think you\u2019re somehow the bad guy here. You\u2019re not. He chose to tear his own family apart, and it\u2019s very selfish of him to think he should get off scott-free after choosing to do so.", "NTA - reap what you sow.

Are you supposed to lie and tell them it wasn't his fault you're splitting up?

Then he shouldn't have cheated.\n\nHe harmed you, and you have the right to seek support from your friends and family while dealing with painful news.  \n\nAs far as your kids go, they almost certainly will find out something, eventually.  You don't have to be the one to tell them at this moment.  But do not lie to them in order to preserve his reputation with the kids.  You'll only break your own reputation with them, when they learn you've lied to them. Answer questions, as they come to you, honestly, truthfully, and plainly, without casting blame, but also without accepting blame on yourself for his behavior and choices. \n\nNo matter what you do or don't tell the kids, you can't change the truth, that he is a cheater.

Cue the tiny violins.", "NTA. This was a case of 'Fuck around,find out.' Your stbx cheated, for years, and kept cheating even after the rumors started. He didn't accidentally cheat, it was deliberate and purposeful. You asked him at least twice and he lied to your face at least twice. Now, karma is coming for him and he wants to play victim.", "Obviously NTA! You didn\u2019t cause him to lose his reputation, he did.", "NTA. Frankly, you're overthinking this.
