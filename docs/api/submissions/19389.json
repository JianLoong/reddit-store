We had been together since 1999. I was broken for a while and probably clinically depressed. I never sought treatment or anything I was just not okay. \n\nI have recently decided that I am done being alone so I asked my friends and family if they knew anyone that I might be interested in getting to know. I have never used online dating and I only had one girlfriend before I met my wife. I am not exactly an expert at how to date. \n\nMy friend's wife said she knew a nice woman and I agreed to go on a double date with them and her. \n\nI thought it went well and I said I would like to see her again. We agreed to go for dinner and see Anastasia. I picked her up at her apartment and once again I had a nice time. There weren't fireworks or anything. But I was comfortable with her and she is physically attractive. \n\nI dropped her back at her home afterwards and went over to see my sister. She insisted I come over and talk after the date so she could \"guide me\". She was best friend's with my wife, we met through her, and she has become my protector since my wife died. \n\nSo I am having tea with my sister and this car pulls into the driveway. It is the woman I was out on a date with. I asked her how she found me, I was kind of freaked out that she followed me. She said she had left an Airtag in my car so she could come over. My sister said that was creepy AF and that if the sexes were reversed the cops would be called. The woman tried to defend herself by saying that I already knew where she lived so it wasn't that big a deal.\n\nI called her a psycho and asked her to please take he tracker out of my car or I would call the cops. \n\nNow I have been hearing for days from my friend's wife saying that I overreacted because I don't know what it is like out there for women dating in their thirties. She says I am being an asshole for blowing it out of proportion and that I should be flattered that this woman wanted to come into my home for whatever after two dates. I told her that I did not need any more help or advice from her and I blocked her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686343686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145gd5c/aita_for_calling_a_woman_a_psycho_for_leaving_a/", "score": 1873, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But why wouldn't she just call and tell me she left something in my car?", "I think it's pretty clear this woman deliberately left the tracker in the car so she could come over to OP's house and follow his movements. \n\nIf she was using it as security then she would have just kept it in her purse.", ">Is it something that she could have been using for her own protection ie: if a date drove her into the woods or something?\n\nIf thats her plan,  just leaving it in the car is dumb. You would want that on your person, not just in the car. They are small, fit in the palm of your hand, and can easily be hidden on yourself, or a purse. She was 100%tracking him", "Yes it could\u2019ve been a mistake and yes she might have had it for her own protection, but then she probably wouldn\u2019t have followed him would she?", "I get what you're asking but I don't think that's the case here. Even if it was something that \"innocently\" fell out of her purse, she would have come clean about it. She would have called and said she left something in the car and could they meet somewhere. And she wouldn't have tried to double down and justify herself when she got there, saying it was fine because he knew where she lived.", "Yeah, exactly. Not putting a tracker in his car. Wtf?", "OP should call the cops. A person who does this is not going to go away just because they were rejected one time. The fact that she's so casual about it (freely admitting what she did) suggests she's tracking a lot of people, and we all know AirTags come more than one to a pack.\n\nThis is why her friend (OP's friend's wife) needs to search her own car before excusing this behavior as just *dating sucks*. You know what's NOT hard for a woman in her thirties? Finding a married BFF!  So what will her excuse be this time?", "And regardless if he knows where she lives- still doesn\u2019t mean tracking the guy is ok!", "Step one: \"I'll meet you there!\"\n\nStep two: Done.", "I honestly am now thinking she did it thinking she was protecting herself in case he turned out to be some sort of serial killer that they can easily \"find him\" if she goes missing and he does too. Which is pretty unhinged considering if she thought that about him, why would she even get into his car alone in the first place???", "I was just thinking \"fatal attraction vibes!\"", "She wanted to make sure he wasn't hooking up with another chick.", "Valid point \ud83e\udd23", "This shouldn't have made me laugh as hard as it did.", "oh, she left that tag in his car so she could track him, not for her own safety.  What her logic was for doing that I don't know.  I DO know that if I found out someone had done that to me, I'd call the police, press charges, ask for an order of protection while I moved .... I watch too many true crime docs to think this kind of behavior is anything but unhinged and terrifying.", "I was expecting to hear that she was angry to find him hanging out with another woman and he'd have to explain he's spending time with his sister to deescalate the situation.", "But wasnt it set up as a double date with mutual friends? She would know if he was married.", "You could put an airtag in your pocket or your bra.  There's no reason to have it out in the car.", ">I could maybe, MAYBE, see putting an AirTag in a dudes car during a date if you don\u2019t know them well and someone else being able to track it as a just in case measure. \n\nNope.  Keep the tag on your person.  Pockets, bras, hell you can even clip it to your underwear.   There is no rational reason to have it out in the car and then leave it, unless they're, like, kidnapping your kid or something.   And then you should clip the tag on the kid.", "Absolutely not.\n\nHaving some way of your friends tracking you (airtag on you, access to your phone's tracking etc) is totally fine, it's no one else's choice who gets to know where you are.\n\nBut there is no reason at all for you to be planting tracking devices on someone without their consent. None.\n\nOP should call the police. NTA.", "I know you\u2019re playing devils advocate with that, but wouldn\u2019t it be more logical to put it on your person? After all it\u2019s you who goes missing and needs finding, not necessarily the car.", "Had me for a moment there omg", "Okay, thank you for clarifying.", "No way. She knew exactly what she was doing. She even admitted it when she said \"you know where I live so...\" NO! That is Not acceptable behavior. What is friend's wife talking about \"you don't know what it's like for a girl to date in her 30s\" I'm in my 30s and by this point in your life, there's no reason to go out with a guy who gives you creep vibes. She's waaay outta line for trying to pull a fast one on you and friend's wife is just enabling chick's psychotic behavior. Unacceptable! \n\nThat's like 12 \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 right off the bat .... this is probably why she's single. Please be careful out there OP. Bitches be trippin lol", "The cops may not have done anything right now, but it establishes a basis for potential future order protections.", "Agreed.  The woman is unhinged.   \n\nWho knows what else she\u2019ll unilaterally decide to do.  \n\nAnd who knows what she\u2019ll CLAIM OP did?", "And OP needs to establish a record of this. The woman's behavior is unhinged, and so far out of the norm that I think he needs to prepare for some kind of escalation.\n\nThis woman doesn't think or make decisions like normal people do, OP. The boundaries and norms that govern other people's behavior aren't a concern for her. Protect yourself now.", "Absolutely! OP, please see this and call the cops. This is not OK and has the makings of an unsafe situation.", "It\u2019s some serious psychotic behaviour and quite frankly I would question the friend\u2019s own morals who thinks it\u2019s ok", "Anyone seen my rabbit. Mmm, what's cooking.", "This, 1,000 times over.  That is creepy AF, and you need to proactively protect yourself.\n\nAlso, if this woman shows up at your front door, DO NOT let her in and call the police immediately.", "I was thinking the exact same thing, look for the rabbit in the pot", "it\u2019s 2023, just share your location with a friend on your phone. no need to bring a tracker with you!!", "Far aaawwwwaaayyyyy", "Exactly", "Kinda crazy reference cause I saw a remake has been in the works. Think it might be a series and would not be surprised if this was in the show.", "What is this in reference to?", "I mean, if you're abducted the first thing the person is going to do is toss your phone, because everyone has seen CSI/L&O/Criminal Minds/a thousand other shows where people are tracked by their phones, so I get why someone might want the safety of a tracker.  But just like the phone, it does you no good unless it is ON you, and it certainly should never be left in the other person's car so YOU can become the stalker.", "It's out already actually, the series", "Maybe it\u2019s just me but if I\u2019m letting a guy drive me home I\u2019m past the point of thinking I\u2019m at risk of being kidnapped.  \n\nAnd she admitted it was to go to his house. It\u2019s insane; how someone can do that and not think it\u2019s embarrassing at best and stalker type behavior at worst is just bizarre.", "Then don't get into strangers cars.\n\nGet a taxi there and back or a bus.\n\nThis is a terrible answer.", "oh, yeah, this lady is bat guano psychotic.  I can understand using an air tag as a security measure on a date with someone you don't know well.  What I can't understand is why you would have that tag anywhere but on your person the whole time.   There's no logical reason for it.  Lots of scary illogical ones, though."]}
