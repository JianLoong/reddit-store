We had been together since 1999. I was broken for a while and probably clinically depressed. I never sought treatment or anything I was just not okay. \n\nI have recently decided that I am done being alone so I asked my friends and family if they knew anyone that I might be interested in getting to know. I have never used online dating and I only had one girlfriend before I met my wife. I am not exactly an expert at how to date. \n\nMy friend's wife said she knew a nice woman and I agreed to go on a double date with them and her. \n\nI thought it went well and I said I would like to see her again. We agreed to go for dinner and see Anastasia. I picked her up at her apartment and once again I had a nice time. There weren't fireworks or anything. But I was comfortable with her and she is physically attractive. \n\nI dropped her back at her home afterwards and went over to see my sister. She insisted I come over and talk after the date so she could \"guide me\". She was best friend's with my wife, we met through her, and she has become my protector since my wife died. \n\nSo I am having tea with my sister and this car pulls into the driveway. It is the woman I was out on a date with. I asked her how she found me, I was kind of freaked out that she followed me. She said she had left an Airtag in my car so she could come over. My sister said that was creepy AF and that if the sexes were reversed the cops would be called. The woman tried to defend herself by saying that I already knew where she lived so it wasn't that big a deal.\n\nI called her a psycho and asked her to please take he tracker out of my car or I would call the cops. \n\nNow I have been hearing for days from my friend's wife saying that I overreacted because I don't know what it is like out there for women dating in their thirties. She says I am being an asshole for blowing it out of proportion and that I should be flattered that this woman wanted to come into my home for whatever after two dates. I told her that I did not need any more help or advice from her and I blocked her. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686343686, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145gd5c/aita_for_calling_a_woman_a_psycho_for_leaving_a/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Run far and fast and don\u2019t look back. That\u2019s deceptive and controlling. It is rather impressive that she was able to stomp boundaries that weren\u2019t even established. If she wanted to come over, she could have asked. Like an adult. Like a sane adult. She doesn\u2019t get to get make that unilateral decision by hiding a tracker on you. \n\nYour sister is right: had you done that, cops would be involved. Everyone would be rallying behind her telling her what a stalker you are.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't matter \"what it's like out there for women in their thirties\" - hiding a tracker in someone's car is always wrong. There's no possible way to defend this. You are correct, and your wife's friend is absurd.", "Only predators date like this.

Fast.\n\nThat's serious bunny-boiler vibes.", "NTA\n\nThat is seriously concerning behavior. It's not normal. It's not ok. It's how a stalker behaves. Don't go out with this woman again, she is serious trouble.", "NTA.   Straight up--it IS a lot more dangerous to date as a woman than as a man.  That's factual.  But there is no rational reason she would have left a tracker in your car.  There is no rational reason for her to TRACK YOU so she could see where you were/who you were with.   An air tag in her purse so her friends can track her?  Absolutely reasonable and rational.  Leaving that tag in your car so she can track you?  Stalking.  I'd make a police report so you at least have a paper trail if she escalates her behavior.", "NTA \nI'm sorry, no, that is not acceptable behavior from anyone dating at any age.  I get why she would have wanted to have an airtag on her person while out with you for protection (assuming someone else was monitoring her whereabouts), but to leave it in your car so she could track you and arrive places announced? Sorry, no. Psycho indeed.", "I promise you that airtag woman is *not* the norm. You were right to sever communication with her. OMFG.\n\nAnd I am sorry your wife\u2019s friend backed up your date. If, after all this time of knowing your wife and you, she was not able to sufficiently vouch for you and your air tagging date wanted more\u2026 I don\u2019t know what you could do or say to convince them you are a good guy.\n\nBut *air tagging* your *car*???* Oh, *hell* no. NTA\n\nAnd after thinking about this for a minute\u2026do you have security cameras? Or a doorbell camera or something?

Those are some huge red flags", "NTA- I'm also a 40 widow and haven't dated in a while, but Jesus Christ that's crazy, and I know crazy.

Psycho.", "NTA! That behavior is not normal! If she wanted to come over or continue the date, why not just call you or say that when you were dropping her off??? Putting a tracker in your vehicle is stalker behavior!!! If you were home & she knocked in the door without you actually giving you her address you should've been freaked out too!", "NTA - that woman is batshit crazy.  Run!", "Anyone who tells you that you are overreacting can go buh-bye from your contacts list. NTA, absolutely run from that stalker", "NTA thats absolutely unhinged behavior and its scary that your friend is trying to convince you otherwise! its one thing to give a friend your location while your on a date to stay safe, a whole other thing to put a tracker in your dates car so you can stalk them after the date like wow thats just. terrifying! so sorry this happened to you", "NTA at all, that\u2019s wild. Keep at it bud, dating is a marathon not a sprint :)", "I fully support this as a woman in my thirties like wtf! OP your sister was right, it is creepy and if some guy ever did that to me I would seriously consider calling the cops. NTA big time and good luck!", "NTA, run!", "NTA and wowza. I\u2019m most shocked that your wife\u2019s friend defended this behavior.", "NTA. That's a really fucked up thing to do.", "NTA\n\nNot only no, but HELL NO.  GPS tracking after 2 dates is NOT NORMAL and NOT OKAY.  If she's doing this after 1 solo date, what will be her expectations if you become exclusive, or move in together, or get married?  There could be no flag bigger or redder unless she was waving an actual big, red flag with \"bunny boiler\" printed on it.  Anyone who thinks you're overreacting is someone you should never allow to set you up on a date.  Trust your sister.  Sounds like she hasn't steered you wrong yet and she's looking out for you.\n\nGood luck in the dating world!  It's tough when you're in your 40s, but not impossible.  I'm sure you'll meet someone great...and with a healthy respect for boundaries.", "NTA, she's doing highly illigal and creepy shit ma dude. She's psycho", "NTA, scary as sh\\*t.  if she wanted to know where you lived all she needed to do is ask.  But to just show up at what she thought was your home WTF.  Go through your car very carefully and have your sister do the same.  Make sure there are no other trackers.  Also file a complaint with the cops, not just for your safety but another guy she might date.", "As a woman, that\u2019s NOT normal dating behavior at all. NTA", "NTA.   And I say this as a woman in my thirties.", "It is not a compliment to be stalked. Stalking you doesn't make her any safer. \n\nYour friends wife introduced you to someone.disturbed.  Maybe  not a psycho in the traditional sense, but your response is understandable. \n\nNTA", "NTA report it to the cops anyway! This is unhinged behaviour. Ignore the gaslighting form your friend.", "Holy shit, NTA! That is some seriously messed up shit. You handled that in the best possible way. Unbelievable that your wife's friend could actually defend her with such a lame excuse. You're absolutely right to sever contact with anyone that could justify such ridiculous behavior.", "But you are a man, you should be flattered.\nShe loves you, give her a second chance.\n/s\nNTA", "NTA. What a psycho.", "NTA- seriously if the roles were reversed I can guarantee you would have the cops called, your name Al over social media, your job at risk. She\u2019s crazy and you should have reported her.

Dating is tough.. this is a horrible experience to go back too.. this is never ok even in a relationship!", "nta. maybe report this to the police? how useful it will be is a toss-up, but if and when she escalates with someone (not necessarily you) it could be helpful for the victim if there\u2019s a record of her behaviour.", "NTA. that  is psycho and creepy.", "NTA\n\nBlock her number, cut her off and your wife's friend isn't your friend if she thinks tracking you at any time, but especially after a first date, is somehow acceptable.\n\nI've been in a similar situation and made the worst mistake of my life dating too early.\n\nStrongly recommend you completely abandon the idea of finding a woman and just work on yourself for at least three more years.\n\nFocus on hobbies that you enjoy, work-out, meditate, whatever, but make the next couple years all about you and being comfortable in your own space - physically and mentally.\n\nIt gets lonely, but learning to embrace and deal with that feeling is growth.\n\nIf you do that you'll likely meet someone effortlessly that's perfect.\n\n\"Trying\" to meet someone has always worked out badly for me and a lot of other's I've known.\n\nAlso, only, and I  mean only, take advice on women from your sister. A lot of the others will have an agenda that's not in your best interests - like your wife's friend (wife's friend, not yours).", "NTA.   NOPE.  Those are some really big red flags.  Nope.  You don't get to stalk me after the first date.  Next thing you know, she is cutting your tires and throwing bricks through your sister's window because she is the \"other woman.\"  Nope.  Run far from that one.", "Good lord, NTA at all.
