You end up entirely on edge.\n\nI think the broadest plan of action must revolve around this:\n\n1- make your parents appreciate how bad he is\n\n2- make your parents aware that this is unsustainable. You either need to leave or he needs to stop. There is no in-between.\n\n3- make your parents deal with it to prevent you from leaving. Your mum needs to understand this.\n\n4- if that fails, you have to move out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBest of luck. There's no excuse for this.

We deserved it.", "If you find my other replies you'll see that I'm far from on the brother's side.

They are the homeowners and the parents, not you. It's their right and responsibility to set household rules, and if they are not willing to set a reasonable rule like \"no loud noise after 11pm on work nights\" then they are not actually on your side and they are failing to be responsible for maintaining a liveable household for you. If you don't want to lose your job by falling asleep in a meeting some time real soon, time to give them an ultimatum: either they put a stop to the nighttime racket permanently by ____ day, or you will have to protect your income and sanity by moving out to somewhere you can be assured of getting 8 uninterrupted hours of sleep every night. It's up to them what to do with that information. When the deadline passes, follow through. Your mom will cry, but she'll be okay. Every parent needs to accept seeing their child leave the nest sometime, and it's not realistic for you to postpone that forever. Good luck.\n\nBut yes YWBTA if you turn off the router instead of putting the responsibility for solving this problem back it belongs: on the heads of the household.", "Turning off the router is what I meant", "P.S. If your mom is committed to keeping you at home for now, they can offer to switch rooms with you. After all, it's been established that your brother's noise can't be heard from their room so that would eliminate your need to move out. Then it's up to them to decide whether their new neighbor's behavior is tolerable for them or not."]}
