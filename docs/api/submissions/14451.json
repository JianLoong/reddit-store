There is usually an app for the router and assuming your parents aren't computer savvy, the admin password should be default. You can find the IP address of his game console and disconnect him at random times. If he compliments you can say the router works for everyone else and it seems like a his problem.", "NTA but I did this once and it did not go well so be prepared.", "NTA \n\nI feel like I just read a post made by myself, my brother is the same way. \n\nThe only difference? \nHe's 13. \nMaybe your brother should grow up lol.", "This.

Your \"right\" is to move out and find yourself a better spot, not to control others that aren't living the way you are.

Sit down with your parents and tell them that either you move out or the Wifi gets turned off at X time. NOT ONLY THAT, you ALL sit down with your brother and explain it to him. 11pm, or whenever, the Wifi goes off. Don't bang on your door. Don't bother you. You're simply turning it off at 11pm, and then that's it. If he doesn't like it, HE can move out.\n\nIf they won't do this, move out.", "Right? I lived with my parents well into my 20s (went to college, had mental health issues), not everyone can just move out on a whim.

It's much more difficult in the modern day so this solution is pretty stupid as we don't know OP's financial situation.", "As someone with sinus issues and allergies, I cannot stand earplugs oe earbuds.  They border on painful.  I move too much to wear headphones in bed. Asking someone to stop doing normal things like walking around is ridiculus.

Until the day I came home to find a note tape to my door about how I walk too loudly at 5:00 in the morning, my toddler runs too loudly, and the toilet is flushed too often.
