Do they deserve your scorn and dehumanization? Absolutely not. Get a clue and maybe some empathy, dude.\n\nETA there's literally nothing in OP's post that alludes to her sister being unhealthily obese- all she says is that her sister put on weight after giving birth. That's actually a super common thing after childbirth- your hormones need to get back on whack, and sometimes that manifests in weight fluctuation.

It sounds like you\u2019re having trouble adjusting to your sister being in this new role and everything changing. Might want to really sit down, evaluate the real reason you\u2019re lashing out in anger, and talk things out. \n\nBecoming a new mom comes with a ton of stress and challenges, including tremendous sleep deprivation and time. It\u2019s pretty harsh for you to be picking on her weight during such a tough transition. Tbh it comes off as unsupportive and selfish. If you\u2019re speaking solely about the phone, she\u2019s TA but sounds like there\u2019s a much bigger issue at hand.", "ESH She shouldn\u2019t have gone through your phone but at least now she knows that you are  an awful person too!", "ESH.

It's not ok to get your privacy violated and then get blamed when she doesn't like what she sees.", "NTA, but YTA for your comments", "I'm actually going with NTA. You're allowed to say mean things in private. She was never meant to see those things. That's one reason not to invade someone's privacy. You're going to get your feelings hurt. You didn't do anything wrong. Going through someone's phone is a massive violation. I'm sure most people say nasty things about their siblings to a significant other. I don't understand why people are getting so high and mighty like they've never said ANYTHING hurtful in private??? Doubtful.", "NTA. \n\nShe did violate your privacy, and that\u2019s a fact regardless of what she has read - it would still be a violation even if you\u2019d only compliment her in your messages to anyone. \n\nRegarding you saying nasty things about her\u2026 I don\u2019t have a twin, I do have an older sister, so the dynamics can be different but I can somewhat relate. I do not always see eye to eye with my sister, we often disagree and argue, and we say things in anger to each other that we don\u2019t really mean (or we mean them, but phrase them in a hurtful way because we argue and that\u2019s what people do when lashing out - unkind, but realistic). Our relationship is intense and I do feel the need to vent out - I vent to my husband or one of my best friends. Why? Because I try to be the best sister I can for my sister - I do need to let the steam out, compose myself and collect my thoughts in a constructive way. Do I say nasty things about her? Yes, I do and I\u2019m sorry for this. Do I walk around and talk shit about my sister? No, I don\u2019t, because I vent to people I trust and that ask me what\u2019s wrong, so I\u2019m not going to lie or sugarcoat it. 9.5 times out of 10, these conversations help me see where I am in the wrong and what are we actually arguing about - so in the bigger picture, it\u2019s beneficial for my relationship with her. In the 30 years of being her sister, I also learned what are the red lines for her - there are just some things I would never say to her or write to anyone, because I know how much they would hurt her and there\u2019s no coming back from that probably. It\u2019s good to know what thes things are for people you care about. \n\nAll of that being said - she probably feels hurt, betrayed and offended and I think these feelings are valid (even though she did bring it on her herself). It can be a good opportunity for the two of you to try and improve your relationship - talk about what bothers you in one another and where this is coming from (jealousy? feeling alienated? difference in values, characters), what are you struggling with, how to disagree in a more constructive way. It is up to you both to try and work this out. Also, we tend to think we always have to have good, close relationships with our siblings or that they are given once and for all - this is not the case. It\u2019s nice to have them, but this is not mandatory. You can just see each other on family gatherings and have a small talk, or you can be BFFs if that\u2019s what works for you. But in any case, if you want this relationship, you have to put the effort, and this also takes learning from your mistakes or understanding what bothers you in one another.", "ESH Invasion of privacy, yah, but gdamn that's fucked up lol", "NTA. Your fat sister shouldn't be touching your shit, and venting to your bf about your problems is allowed", "NTA.", "NTA\u2026 people talk sh** about people it happens all the time. It\u2019s OK to vent.", "Well, I would say that\u2019s pretty fucken mean on that one, but nobody should go through your phone unless it\u2019s a parent to guardian with a proper reason. I would say it\u2019s 50/50", "ESH but almost leaning YTA\n\nReasons are pretty obvious for both. Sister for invading privacy and OP for just being a mean person. As others have said. Maybe you\u2019re the one who needs therapy.

You said unpleasant things, which makes you obnoxious, but your sister should not have gone through your phone. 'Never listen at a knothole lest you be vexed'.", "We can't control the thoughts that come into our head.

Everyone talks smack about everyone. She\u2019s even talked smack about me. I feel bad that she saw those messages but she was never supposed to go through my phone and invade my and other peoples privacy. We\u2019ve never gone through each others phone before in our 22 years of living together and I never had to worry about my face recognition but she ruined the trust I had in her.", "You can't control the thoughts that come into your head, that's true. But you can keep them to yourself, just don't put that shit out in the universe.", "Yeah no, nice try OP. One little comment is not a \"RiGhT?\", you're not absolved. Do people talk smack behind other's backs often? Sure. Does that make it a good thing? No it doesn't. Are you absolved of weight-shaming your sister post-delivery? Definitely not. It'd be one thing if you were complaining about, say, her not doing dishes or stealing your clothes or whatever. But you weren't. You were making comment about her body, and there's no universe where that's not awful. Grow the hell up.\n\nYour sister is still in the wrong for going through your phone, but YOU'RE still terrible for weight-shaming in the first place, even if it was in private. Belittling your sister for putting on weight, even if it was to ONE person, is still awful of you. I literally know people younger than you who wouldn't stoop to fat-shaming someone when they just went through a HUGE life and body change. So you can cool with feeling justified. You aren't.\n\nEDIT: Move out. If you're at the point of life where you're 22 years old and still complaining about your sister like you're a juvenile on an episode of The Suite Life of Zach and Cody, you need to move out and get more of a life. If you've lived at home for 22 years like you say in your comment, my assumption is that you didn't go to college and have been part of the work force since then. Save your damn money and move out so that you can have bigger fish to fry than complaining about your sister.", "I feel that you\u2019re an idiot. But I\u2019m not an asshole for saying that because I\u2019m just sharing my feelings :)", "venting and bitching are two VERY different things. venting is \u201cABC did XYZ and it really pissed me off ect\u201d\n\nbitching is\u2026 bitching about your post-partem sisters weight gain that has absolutely nothing to do with you", "Omg chill", "Paladins of lies ;) you never feel disgust looking on someone fat, or concern if its someone close, never share this felling with thirt persons.", "And i think you really need to read OP post again with understanding ;)", "Meybe do, meybe she feel disgust, concern and need to share it with someone.", "Uh, what? I'm not really sure what your point is, or what you're trying to say from your comment, but no, I'm not inherently disgusted by someone being bigger. I mean, hell, I used to suffer from anorexia myself, so I'm the last person to beeline towards judgement against someone for weight management or disordered eating. You also mention concern- if i was truly concerned about someone being unhealthy with eating or weight change, I'd legitimately tell them. What I WOULDN'T do is gossip about it behind their back. That solves nothing, and is just plain cruel. So again, not sure what you mean by your comment, but it seems like you're grasping at red herrings. As someone who's a huge fan of the Fallout game series though, I'll take the \"paladin\" business as a compliment lmao. \n\nYou also failed to address my previous comment. Calling someone fat is not a \"feeling\". It's a statement and a judgement. But toss those misplaced winky-faces where you see fit, I guess.", "if she\u2019s feels disgusted by someone gaining weight she need serious mental help.\n\nif she\u2019s concerned about her sister, she needs to talk *too* her sister - not her boyfriend. it\u2019s also so beyond normal to gain weight after having a baby so i highly doubt it\u2019s concern.\n\nalso not trying to be mean with this but it\u2019s spelt maybe!"]}
