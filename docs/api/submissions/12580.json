We are at the neighborhood park, (not a dog park and all dogs are supposed to stay leashed) and my son, my wife and I are having a picnic.  Its going great.  Baby is on a big blanket and having the time of his life rolling around, playing, giggling.  Its a blast seeing him so happy.  \n\nWe are semi near a walking path.  Next thing I know there is a pair of puppy's coming right at us.  They are unleashed, and their owner is just standing on the walking path looking at them running toward us.  I didn't notice them until they were pretty much on our blanket.  At that point I picked up my son and yelled WTF to the guy.  He looked appalled that I didn't enjoy the stunt his dogs and him pulled.  My wife is yelling at him, i'm yelling at him.  I straight up say I hate your dogs, can you get them.  His puppy's are just sitting on our blanket expecting to get petted.  I start walking toward the guy and am yelling at him to get his dogs.  \n\nHe starts getting mad at us.  He says they are friendly and just wanted to play, they aren't going to hurt anyone.  I tell him he just ruined our lunch.  He excuses his and the dogs behavior by saying they are puppies.  I don't care I just want him and his dogs gone.  I'm just cussin at him continuesly.  He's telling me to calm down but i'm hot.  I continue cussing and he finally grabs his two dogs and is like who doesn't like puppies.  He finally leaves buthe ruined our lunch.  In hindite I may have been to aggresive with him.

Him for having the dogs unleashed and not removing them immediately but you are the bigger AH for the entire over-the-top ridiculous reaction. You sat there repeatedly cussing at someone in front of your child. You are teaching him how to react to people even at his young age.

He shouldn't have had the dog off the lead in a park where that's the rule, and should have at least been trying to prevent the dogs from approaching people.

I am not a toddler person, I can stand them, but I prefer the company of my nephews who are 6yo and above (i prefer not being alone with the younger ones). That being said, twice on the street, a toddler who's confused me for its mom has grabbed my leg. I just laughed it off whilst the parents apologised. There are people who absolutely hate kids. They live in childfree buildings and avoid child friendly places. If your toddler/ kid makes a fuss, throws a tantrum, runs up to a person, and that person reacts by screaming and cussing at you, how will you react? \n\nI'm just saying that either remember how you reacted when something you hate invaded your personal space so you are ready for something similar to happen to you or learn to control your outbursts (your wife too).\n\nClarification: I'm NOT comparing dogs to kids.

Like. I'd get if there was a phobia at play, some bad prior experience, anything.

Dog owners shouldn't be allowing their dogs to just run up to people, I mean, people have phobias, allergies etc.\n\nYour reaction is way over the top though, to the point you're dragging this back from E S H to YTA.\n\nYou're constantly just cussing at him? Too much, just too much.\n\nThe guy was in the wrong, but it's a harmless mistake. You made yourself the asshole by going completely crazy over a really small thing.\n\nI'm going to stick with the YTA, you made far too big a deal of this, and you don't get to verbally abuse everybody that makes a tiny mistake.", "Man, this is coming from a dog person, but, NTA\n\nThis dude totally was in the wrong and you were correct to be upset. Puppies, yeah, so they have *no* impulse control and certainly aren't being trained for any if they are just allowed to go off leash and run up begging to strangers. 6mos is way too young to just have some strange dogs come up on you. This guy put both your baby and his puppies in danger with this little stunt.\n\nYeah, you may have gotten aggressive, but really, this guy wasn't getting the picture. Poorly trained \"friendly\" dogs ruin the whole concept for people.", "YTA, cussing him out was a bit much imo", "ESH.\n\nIf it's a peice of land where dogs need to be leashed, they need to be leashed, no matter if they are puppies or already grown up.\n\nInstead of taking this moment to teach you child how to be level headed and carrying out a conversation tho, you decided to throw a fit and actively cuss at the owner. A situation that could have been cleared up by a reasonable discussion was discarded for the sake of \"this is about me\" mentality. (Can you maybe elaborate on how your lunch got ruined? did they get to the food?)\n\nStill those dogs should have been leashed and I don't want to invalidate your dislike of dogs in general.\n\nBut you are not equipped with the mindset to raise a reasonable child", "YTA\n\nYou and your wife did not handle this well at all.", "ESH.  It's PUPPIES!!!\n\nThen again, puppies need to be trained.  Letting them run up to any random stranger is the opposite of training...\n\nSo the dog owner was irresponsible.  But your whole family overreacted.", "ESH - swearing and yelling from the offset was a bit of an overreaction (unless you have a genuine phobia of dogs or similar), but the guy should have kept the dogs on a leash and understood that not everyone likes dogs. I reckon he sucks more than you, but you still suck a little, and it would be worth learning to control your anger/volume a bit more in the future.", "ESH, but YTA. Yeah, the guy made a huge error in judgment by leaving two (undisciplined at that) dogs unleashed, but cussing and screaming? In front of you poor baby, who understands nothing other than Mommy and Daddy are really fucking scary right now? Grow up. Model better behavior.", "NTA. You definitely overreacted, but he shouldn\u2019t had his dogs off leash.", "ESH - it always annoys me when people don't keep good control over their dogs, or trying to excuse them as \"just harmless, not going to hurt you\" blah blah blah. I was petrified of dogs as a child and spent years hating owners who offered this kind of excuse because, no, they are not harmless to a little kid who is terrified of their four-legged fur buddy\n\nHAVING SAID THAT - I feel like you may have overreacted a bit. By all means, explain to the owner that you are not in a dog-park and that dogs are meant to be kept on leads. Tell them you are uncomfortable with them (hell say allergies if you need to, that generally makes the owners a bit quicker to react) and get them to take their animal out of your periphery. But yelling and cussing and going 'I hate dogs' isn't really the right way about it. You just make yourself look small and petty and unreasonably entitled as if the whole world should automatically know your preferences and change to suit you. That's not a good example to be setting for your offspring", "ESH. Letting dogs of any age approach a family with such a young child, or any child really, is irresponsible. However your excessive reaction may have stunned him into not reacting quicker and caused him to act defensivly. Also you are well on the way to instilling a fear of dogs into your children.", "YTA massive overreaction. Who the hell reacts like that to a pretty normal situation. Definitely a better way to handle it", "ESH. Yes, he should\u2019ve leashed his dogs. But your reaction was completely over the top and inappropriate. Screaming obscenities over and over at a stranger and telling him you hate his dogs? You acted like an ill-tempered child. \n\nAlso additionally, anyone who hates dogs so viscerally is absurd and takes themselves too seriously. Not being a fan is one thing but you seem to have a bizarre pathological hatred. Get over yourself OP.", "ESH, but barely. \n\nHe's obviously an AH. You don't let your dogs off-leash in a leashes-only area, you don't let your dogs run off-leash if they've got poor recall or are easily distracted, you *definitely* keep your dogs from charging strangers, and you **absolutely** keep your dogs away from strange children, especially very young ones. \n\nBut you were holding an infant, cussing someone out, and approaching like you were going to start a fight. You don't escalate shit while you're holding a kid -the swearing was possibly justified (even a puppy can do a lot of damage to a little baby), but that's escalation on its own, and heading towards the guy was worse. That's what tips you over the edge, not cussing the guy out or not liking puppies. Prioritizing being mad at the guy and disliking dogs over keeping your kid safe is a problem. Pick your kid up and *walk away* next time.", "YTA for acting like a crazes lunatic in front of your kid over a couple of puppies.

The guy needs to leash his dogs and train them while they're young. But your behavior was appalling. Even at this age, in just 1 incident, you can teach your child that \"when a dog is nearby, daddy becomes scary.\"\n\nAnd honestly, parenting is all about getting thrown into situations you don't plan for. Your attitude will make or break every one of these memories. Teach your kid that unexpected doesn't mean ruined.", "ESH. Yes, he definitely should have had his dogs on leashes.

You can easily convey your displeasure while being calm- even while being polite.", "ESH", "ESH\n\nThe owner of the dogs should have had them on leash and, in absence of that, retrieved them from your blanket and apologized immediately.

For one, shouting and continuously cussing in a neighborhood park where there are likely children older than your 6-month old nearby is not a good look. Hopefully some impressionable youngsters didn\u2019t pick up any new vocabulary from you that day. Secondly, getting that aggressive with a stranger is not the smartest thing with how crazy people can be these days.

I would absolutely love two random puppies to run up to me in almost any situation in my daily life. But I understand not everyone feels that way, and boundaries need to be respected.

Yeah, the other guy was in the wrong for not having his puppies leashed and the idea that everyone should love your dogs is pretty entitled, but you went from 0 to 60 in one leap.

I feel bad for anyone around you that has dogs. Your hatred for something shouldn't be everyone's problem in a public space.", "ESH, but the dog owner is definitely more of an AH here. You could have made your displeasure known without swearing, but I can understand being startled and scared for your child. The dog owner is definitely an AH for having his dogs off the leash in a leash only area and for not being able to reliably recall them straight away (probably because they\u2019re not old enough yet). I like dogs, but I would be a bit wary if a strange dog I didn\u2019t know came up to a baby in my care while we were sitting on the ground.", "NTA I have two small dogs that I always keep on a leash, expect for actual dog parks, and whenever I get upset when other people let their dogs run everywhere.

You could've been calmer but it could've been avoided if those dogs were leashed.", "NTA. I agree that you were (maybe too) aggressive with him, but giving you the benefit of the doubt because the reaction you're describing also sounds rooted in some kind of deeper fear or anxiety.
