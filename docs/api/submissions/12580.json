We are at the neighborhood park, (not a dog park and all dogs are supposed to stay leashed) and my son, my wife and I are having a picnic.  Its going great.  Baby is on a big blanket and having the time of his life rolling around, playing, giggling.  Its a blast seeing him so happy.  \n\nWe are semi near a walking path.  Next thing I know there is a pair of puppy's coming right at us.  They are unleashed, and their owner is just standing on the walking path looking at them running toward us.  I didn't notice them until they were pretty much on our blanket.  At that point I picked up my son and yelled WTF to the guy.  He looked appalled that I didn't enjoy the stunt his dogs and him pulled.  My wife is yelling at him, i'm yelling at him.  I straight up say I hate your dogs, can you get them.  His puppy's are just sitting on our blanket expecting to get petted.  I start walking toward the guy and am yelling at him to get his dogs.  \n\nHe starts getting mad at us.  He says they are friendly and just wanted to play, they aren't going to hurt anyone.  I tell him he just ruined our lunch.  He excuses his and the dogs behavior by saying they are puppies.  I don't care I just want him and his dogs gone.  I'm just cussin at him continuesly.  He's telling me to calm down but i'm hot.  I continue cussing and he finally grabs his two dogs and is like who doesn't like puppies.  He finally leaves buthe ruined our lunch.  In hindite I may have been to aggresive with him.

Him for having the dogs unleashed and not removing them immediately but you are the bigger AH for the entire over-the-top ridiculous reaction. You sat there repeatedly cussing at someone in front of your child. You are teaching him how to react to people even at his young age.

He shouldn't have had the dog off the lead in a park where that's the rule, and should have at least been trying to prevent the dogs from approaching people.

I am not a toddler person, I can stand them, but I prefer the company of my nephews who are 6yo and above (i prefer not being alone with the younger ones). That being said, twice on the street, a toddler who's confused me for its mom has grabbed my leg. I just laughed it off whilst the parents apologised. There are people who absolutely hate kids. They live in childfree buildings and avoid child friendly places. If your toddler/ kid makes a fuss, throws a tantrum, runs up to a person, and that person reacts by screaming and cussing at you, how will you react? \n\nI'm just saying that either remember how you reacted when something you hate invaded your personal space so you are ready for something similar to happen to you or learn to control your outbursts (your wife too).\n\nClarification: I'm NOT comparing dogs to kids.

Like. I'd get if there was a phobia at play, some bad prior experience, anything.

Dog owners shouldn't be allowing their dogs to just run up to people, I mean, people have phobias, allergies etc.\n\nYour reaction is way over the top though, to the point you're dragging this back from E S H to YTA.\n\nYou're constantly just cussing at him? Too much, just too much.\n\nThe guy was in the wrong, but it's a harmless mistake. You made yourself the asshole by going completely crazy over a really small thing.\n\nI'm going to stick with the YTA, you made far too big a deal of this, and you don't get to verbally abuse everybody that makes a tiny mistake.", "Man, this is coming from a dog person, but, NTA\n\nThis dude totally was in the wrong and you were correct to be upset. Puppies, yeah, so they have *no* impulse control and certainly aren't being trained for any if they are just allowed to go off leash and run up begging to strangers. 6mos is way too young to just have some strange dogs come up on you. This guy put both your baby and his puppies in danger with this little stunt.\n\nYeah, you may have gotten aggressive, but really, this guy wasn't getting the picture. Poorly trained \"friendly\" dogs ruin the whole concept for people.", "YTA, cussing him out was a bit much imo", "ESH.\n\nIf it's a peice of land where dogs need to be leashed, they need to be leashed, no matter if they are puppies or already grown up.\n\nInstead of taking this moment to teach you child how to be level headed and carrying out a conversation tho, you decided to throw a fit and actively cuss at the owner. A situation that could have been cleared up by a reasonable discussion was discarded for the sake of \"this is about me\" mentality. (Can you maybe elaborate on how your lunch got ruined? did they get to the food?)\n\nStill those dogs should have been leashed and I don't want to invalidate your dislike of dogs in general.\n\nBut you are not equipped with the mindset to raise a reasonable child", "YTA\n\nYou and your wife did not handle this well at all.", "ESH.  It's PUPPIES!!!\n\nThen again, puppies need to be trained.  Letting them run up to any random stranger is the opposite of training...\n\nSo the dog owner was irresponsible.  But your whole family overreacted.", "ESH - swearing and yelling from the offset was a bit of an overreaction (unless you have a genuine phobia of dogs or similar), but the guy should have kept the dogs on a leash and understood that not everyone likes dogs. I reckon he sucks more than you, but you still suck a little, and it would be worth learning to control your anger/volume a bit more in the future.", "ESH, but YTA. Yeah, the guy made a huge error in judgment by leaving two (undisciplined at that) dogs unleashed, but cussing and screaming? In front of you poor baby, who understands nothing other than Mommy and Daddy are really fucking scary right now? Grow up. Model better behavior.", "NTA. You definitely overreacted, but he shouldn\u2019t had his dogs off leash.", "ESH - it always annoys me when people don't keep good control over their dogs, or trying to excuse them as \"just harmless, not going to hurt you\" blah blah blah. I was petrified of dogs as a child and spent years hating owners who offered this kind of excuse because, no, they are not harmless to a little kid who is terrified of their four-legged fur buddy\n\nHAVING SAID THAT - I feel like you may have overreacted a bit. By all means, explain to the owner that you are not in a dog-park and that dogs are meant to be kept on leads. Tell them you are uncomfortable with them (hell say allergies if you need to, that generally makes the owners a bit quicker to react) and get them to take their animal out of your periphery. But yelling and cussing and going 'I hate dogs' isn't really the right way about it. You just make yourself look small and petty and unreasonably entitled as if the whole world should automatically know your preferences and change to suit you. That's not a good example to be setting for your offspring", "ESH. Letting dogs of any age approach a family with such a young child, or any child really, is irresponsible. However your excessive reaction may have stunned him into not reacting quicker and caused him to act defensivly. Also you are well on the way to instilling a fear of dogs into your children.", "YTA massive overreaction. Who the hell reacts like that to a pretty normal situation. Definitely a better way to handle it", "ESH. Yes, he should\u2019ve leashed his dogs. But your reaction was completely over the top and inappropriate. Screaming obscenities over and over at a stranger and telling him you hate his dogs? You acted like an ill-tempered child. \n\nAlso additionally, anyone who hates dogs so viscerally is absurd and takes themselves too seriously. Not being a fan is one thing but you seem to have a bizarre pathological hatred. Get over yourself OP.", "ESH, but barely. \n\nHe's obviously an AH. You don't let your dogs off-leash in a leashes-only area, you don't let your dogs run off-leash if they've got poor recall or are easily distracted, you *definitely* keep your dogs from charging strangers, and you **absolutely** keep your dogs away from strange children, especially very young ones. \n\nBut you were holding an infant, cussing someone out, and approaching like you were going to start a fight. You don't escalate shit while you're holding a kid -the swearing was possibly justified (even a puppy can do a lot of damage to a little baby), but that's escalation on its own, and heading towards the guy was worse. That's what tips you over the edge, not cussing the guy out or not liking puppies. Prioritizing being mad at the guy and disliking dogs over keeping your kid safe is a problem. Pick your kid up and *walk away* next time.", "YTA for acting like a crazes lunatic in front of your kid over a couple of puppies.

The guy needs to leash his dogs and train them while they're young. But your behavior was appalling. Even at this age, in just 1 incident, you can teach your child that \"when a dog is nearby, daddy becomes scary.\"\n\nAnd honestly, parenting is all about getting thrown into situations you don't plan for. Your attitude will make or break every one of these memories. Teach your kid that unexpected doesn't mean ruined.", "ESH. Yes, he definitely should have had his dogs on leashes.

You can easily convey your displeasure while being calm- even while being polite.", "ESH", "ESH\n\nThe owner of the dogs should have had them on leash and, in absence of that, retrieved them from your blanket and apologized immediately.

For one, shouting and continuously cussing in a neighborhood park where there are likely children older than your 6-month old nearby is not a good look. Hopefully some impressionable youngsters didn\u2019t pick up any new vocabulary from you that day. Secondly, getting that aggressive with a stranger is not the smartest thing with how crazy people can be these days.

I would absolutely love two random puppies to run up to me in almost any situation in my daily life. But I understand not everyone feels that way, and boundaries need to be respected.

Yeah, the other guy was in the wrong for not having his puppies leashed and the idea that everyone should love your dogs is pretty entitled, but you went from 0 to 60 in one leap.

I feel bad for anyone around you that has dogs. Your hatred for something shouldn't be everyone's problem in a public space.", "ESH, but the dog owner is definitely more of an AH here. You could have made your displeasure known without swearing, but I can understand being startled and scared for your child. The dog owner is definitely an AH for having his dogs off the leash in a leash only area and for not being able to reliably recall them straight away (probably because they\u2019re not old enough yet). I like dogs, but I would be a bit wary if a strange dog I didn\u2019t know came up to a baby in my care while we were sitting on the ground.", "NTA I have two small dogs that I always keep on a leash, expect for actual dog parks, and whenever I get upset when other people let their dogs run everywhere.

You could've been calmer but it could've been avoided if those dogs were leashed.", "NTA. I agree that you were (maybe too) aggressive with him, but giving you the benefit of the doubt because the reaction you're describing also sounds rooted in some kind of deeper fear or anxiety.

As for the dogs not having bit the baby, are you saying OP should\u2019ve waited until it happened? Puppies especially go through a stage where they try to bite everything. Why risk it?", "I would like to hope that if the dude retold the story to anyone in his circle that at least one person would call him out on his behavior", "I love dogs, too. I have a friend who was attacked when she was younger, and it\u2019s made me see situations like this in a whole new light. Even without trauma, not everyone is going to be enthusiastic about animals running towards them.", "I\u2019ve only had a couple bad experiences with dogs (the worst being 7 when one tried to jump but scratched down my back). I made sure my kid knows to ask me if she can ask them. She also knows to stand at least 5 feet away just in case", "This is super duper true. In OP's case I could have understood some mild annoyance at being intruded upon by rude puppies and a negligent owner. But unless the dogs were running over, acting wild (ie trying to lick the baby or steal the food or being aggressive or peeing on things or whatever lol) or there was another serious problem (like a severe dog allergy lol) then starting off aggressive off the bat and escalating when a couple of puppies calmly walked up and plopped themselves on your blanket hopefully is way out of line. \n\nAnd honestly? If nothing else, OP really did create a bigger potential risk during the situation for himself and his family. Much like humans, dogs will lash out when scared and often will try to protect their owner from perceived threats (especially when they're young and still learning impulse control) and so by immediately becoming agro like that he could have scared one of the dogs and been bitten as a result. \n\nI cannot *stand* when people don't teach their dogs manners (as an animal person myself, with one small dog (now, I had a pittie until a few months ago) and four cats) and I really get uncomfortable when people don't leash their animals in public because you never know when a dog is going to get into something they shouldn't/approach another dog that is reactive/have someone lash out at them/decide not to listen and get hurt (especially in the case of puppies because puppies are actual gremlins with minds of their own lol) but despite all of that, I could be understanding of \"two mostly well-behaved puppies wandered over and sat on my blanket hoping I'd pay attention to them\" whether or not they were leashed. \n\nA good owner would have not let that happen initially or immediately corrected them/apologized (for instance I've had the same thing happen with my chi when he was still pretty young, maybe like 8mons old. I stopped to tie my shoe, someone was sitting on the grass about 5ft away, and he darted off and just jumped on their lap. He could just barely make it thanks to the length of his leash lol I pretty much immediately started to call him back and apologized for his bad behavior, they laughed and said it was okay and paid attention to him. That's how those situations should go!) \n\nBut even my friend who was terrified of dogs for quote some time understands that sometimes dogs \"act up\" in public because they get overstimulated and such. I also can't entirely blame the owner for not immediately reacting correctly in that situation because if someone escalated that quickly over what equated to some relatively innocent puppy mischief I'd likely be put off too.\n\nSo yeah. I fully agree that they should have been leashed and the owner should have recalled them as soon as he noticed they were bothering somebody else. But OP's reaction was entirely uncalled for. And could have caused the puppies to become reactive, which could have turned ugly quick. It's definitely one of those ESH situations.", "And? Of course he yelled WTF.

And if the OP's family had allergies or something that would warrant POLITELY calling out and explaining that the family has allergies and could he please come collect these puppies, then I'm sure the owner would have immediately and apologetically rushed over to keep the puppies off the blanket. But this was a zero-danger situation and also not even an allergy situation, and the OP describes not even one attempt to be polite with the puppy owner. Just IMMEDIATE screaming and cussing, which of course probably delayed the situation getting resolved because suddenly an actual physical threat was present in this situation (that is, an adult human male was screaming and cussing and threatening toward the puppy owner, while the adult female was screaming angrily too) and the puppy owner had to pause and consider whether he actually needed to keep his distance from these crazy people or how best to collect his puppies to keep them safe from the crazy people, without putting himself in potential harm's way too.\n\nBasically, OP's approach was the worst possible response if he actually wanted his concern resolved quickly.

We (my family and I) were coming back from a horse show that I had just won my first ever first place rosette in with my Shetland pony. I was riding my pony back home, with my uncle, aunt, mother, and grandma leading the way. We were coming back through a local nature reserve that has a park on it (Chasewater park, in the West Midlands of England). It\u2019s an animal friendly place, but dogs are meant to be kept on leashes. \n\nOn this occasion, it was a beautiful summers day. There were lots of families at the park. As I was riding, (a gentle walk as I was a small child and I was being led by lead reign by my family members) I saw something run at me. A guy from a nearby city (Wolverhampton) had brought his Rottweiler to the park, and had it off the leash. He didn\u2019t actually have any kind of leash with him at all. The dog saw my pony and decided to kill it. I was dragged for just over 100 metres, breaking 8 of my fingers and a couple of ribs. The dog bit my back several times. Thankfully, I had on a thick riding jacket (it was warm weather, but safety was of utmost importance so I had on jodhpurs, boots, jacket, and skull cap) and so I wasn\u2019t horribly injured though I did have several points where the skin was broken by the teeth. It then ran after my pony and started to attack it. My pony gave it a valiant little fight, and kicked the dog over and over until my uncle managed to get to them with the dogs owner. At this point, tbf, my uncle did threaten to stab the dog if the owner didn\u2019t get it under control and away from the park straight away (I do think this was more anger than real threat, as my uncle wasn\u2019t ever known to hurt anything, but I don\u2019t know for sure). \n\nI was scared of dogs for years after. My family have trained animals (mainly horses) for generations. I made it a point to learn to train dogs too, and did it professionally for several years, so as to get over my fear. I actually learned by volunteering with the RSPCA and one of the staff members putting me in touch with a school. \n\nI\u2019ve always tried my hardest to maintain composure and be polite and courteous to anyone and everyone, at least until they give proper reason to no longer show that respect to them. I\u2019ve worked in several roles that need me to be face to face with the general public, and politeness has always de-escalated situations better than when co-workers have been difficult instead. That said, I think it\u2019s that point of view of always trying to be understanding and polite that has me trying to get why OP blew up how they did. They were in a situation that was difficult for them. They shouldn\u2019t have handled it how they did, but they kind of admit that, really. \n\nSorry for the long post. TL:DR.

I love dogs and grew up with dogs my whole life, but I would be mad too. Even without biting or nipping, many puppies do not understand their own strength. If these were great dane, german shepherd, great pyrenees, or any big dog breed that is actually old enough to interact with other dogs at parks. They are probably old enough to have some strength to them and could hurt a baby even without biting by running it over or tumbling over it. I would be less concerned about that if there were little puppies but puppies nip at each other all the time to play and that could seriously hurt a baby. Without being around dogs before, I wouldn't have known if my kid might be allergic to dogs (I was) or if the owner was actually making sure they had their shots.", "I am so incredibly sorry that you experienced such a traumatic attack. After such an exiting day too! I so admire that you put in the time and effort to get comfortable training dogs after such a formative childhood experience. Most people would not have been able to do so, and I could not blame them! The way you handled it is truly amazing, in my opinion. \n\nI agree that OP had very valid reasons for being upset, and while his reaction was extreme, as you said no one is perfect. I have definitely responded to times of stress in ways I'd do differently in the future. \n\nIt's good to keep in mind that people often stop listening when they feel attacked. Sometimes it's live and learn, and try again better prepared in the future. We're all learning as we go!", "It's not even just about biting. Allergies exist.", "OH I wish I had a nickel every time some AH dog owner says this about their unleashed dog. FUME."]}
