Every time I come home I am either a taxi, maid or babysitter with little to no time to myself.

This morning she comes into my room while I am asleep and kicks me awake to start yelling at me to take her. I will admit I lost my cool and told her to get out of my room and that I wasnt taking her. My mom then said I was being a brat and selfish because now she had to take her. My little sister was then rushing my mom and eventually came back into my room to wake me up again to demand i take her to school. It was only then that my mom told her to leave me alone and it of course was followed with some backhanded comment of \u201cshes being a selfish brat\u201d\n\nI dont feel like i didnt anything wrong, i am not obligated to take her to school and i already said no. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671112122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmlhqt/aita_for_not_taking_my_sister_to_school_at_730_am/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course anyone would prefer to be dropped at the door instead of walking or taking the bus, but you should not be treated as a free Uber just because you happen to be home.\n\nYour mom and the rest of your family try to guilt you into these things, because IT WORKS FOR THEM.

They ignore the comments and whoever is trying to guilt them moves on to an easier target (you).", "How are you and your twin different ages?", "NTA, you need some serious space from your family. It is clearly a very toxic environment and the fact you are in school and working and contributing to the household is already admirable but it isn't your responsability to be taking care of your siblings when your mom is there.\n\nRegarding the morning incident, your mother was clearly home, thre is absolutely no reason for her to not be bringing her own child to school. Until you go back to school, try and stay in your room, hopefully you can install a lock of some sort to keep them out, make your own meals and clean up after yourself and your own space. Don't let the negative comments affect you as it is just tactics to get you to cave and do what they want.", "NTA. They are mad because you stopped being a doormat and started to stand up for yourself, which you should have done earlier.", "Is there anyone at school you can reach out to right now? Explain that you\u2019re in a toxic/abusive home. They may have an idea of where you can say safety\n\nDid you make any friends that you feel comfortable asking if you can crash at their place for the holidays? Tell them you know it\u2019s a HUGE ask it\u2019s just your home is toxic and you\u2019re struggling. You may have to couch surf which is annoying but has to be better than this. Any friends at home you can stay with? Aunts/uncles grandparents you can reach out to?\n\nYou\u2019re NTA but you are in a very tough spot right now. Reach out to student services they may have safe spaces for you to stay at, does your school offer free/cheap therapy? Even if you can\u2019t stay somewhere else, having someone to talk to and offer advice will help save your sanity and give you tools to deal with your mom. \u2018Grey rocking\u2019 might be your best option now. Though it can be hard to do long term \n\nYou also need to figure a long term plan (once you\u2019re done school) does your city have subsidized housing? They can have a very long wait, get on the waiting list. Subsidized housing is wonderful as you only pay a percentage of your gross monthly income (usually about 30%) I\u2019ve been in my place for 16.5 years now. I have paid as little as $85/month up to $800 (I\u2019ve had various jobs over the years some paid better than others) when you talk with your intake worker, let them know you\u2019re in an abusive home, your a student, they may have short term housing for students. They may also have Financial support for folks waiting for a place. mine gives about $200/month towards rent (though it may have gone up, I hope it\u2019s gone up)\n\nThere are groups that will help you find housing, food, therapy. You just have to look and ask. \n\nGood luck", "NTA but stop going home and stop sending money. Your mom\u2019s delusions will come crashing down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your mom needs to stop treating you like another parent. I\u2019m sure she could use some help around the house but demanding it and only expecting it of one child isn\u2019t how to go about that. \n\nA break for yourself is really important and you should be somewhere you don\u2019t have to deal with that.", "A lot of universities will make accommodations available for students who can't travel home on breaks (my daughter went to a school 3,500 miles away and wasn't always able to come home every time dorms were closed.

Good luck and NTA of course.", "Totally understand, and it was just a thought so your have some down time to yourself without all that craziness going on every day you\u2019re home. Try talking to you mom, although i don\u2019t know how far that will get you, but your definitely NTA. Id be finding a good friend to crash with for a day or two at least if possible", "Does your mom do that with your twin's age also? Or does she just do that to you?", "Maybe you should use this Christmas break to go apartment hunting? Can you swing an apartment while going to school? Is living with your boyfriend an option? You guys could use the Christmas break as test run. if has four other roommates it might not work, but even then, if it\u2019s only for a few weeks they might be ok with you staying there. Make sure to chip in for rent/bills. Help keep the place clean, volunteer to cook a couple group meals a week. Helping keep their place clean and cooking a few times a week will probably be way less work and less stressful than what\u2019s going on at home\n\nI\u2019m just glad you have a few options. Sadly some folks don\u2019t have friends or family and get stuck in a really bad place"]}
