Cara (my daughter) and (her husband) Sean live in MA. \n\nCara is pregnant with their first in March. \n\nIn Sept, my step son gifted new floors to cara and Sean for their kitchen. I offered to help with install. Their home is over 100 years old. I am not a contractor or a carpenter but I am  good at home repairs. I was supposed to only install the floors but during demo, I encouraged them to demo some cabinets so the flooring laid down better. I said I would help with prep on weekends and come back from FL in Nov to assemble new cabinets and install. They agreed. They are new home owners and not handy but were eager to work. The walls ended up being covered in rotting horsehair plaster which was a surprise. When the weekend ended, there was no stove hook up, floors were 10% installed and it was a bit of a mess. I left it to them to plaster the walls that week and I\u2019d come next weekend. \n\nBy Tuesday Cara and Sean called in a panic, saying the plaster was a disaster and that Cara was afraid of the stress on her pregnancy. I told them to wait.  Cara told me she felt mislead and that the project spiraled out of control and asked me to take ownership (not financial) for my hand in their issues. I told them they made their choice to demo and it\u2019s not my house. They paid me for my help and hired contractor. They said I\u2019m not able to commit to a project of this size (I work FT and help my step son with his flip)  and didn\u2019t believe I would come back to help after leaving for FL and Cara is uncomfortable with working during pregnancy, all to which I disagreed. I was hurt they fired me and still am. \n\nIt\u2019s been weird since. I have not reached out to ask about the kitchen or the baby, though they provided scattered updates on the baby and Karen asked about the baby a few times. Recently Cara reached out saying this has been terrible- they had to pull permits from the town, they haven\u2019t had a stove or sink in months. Cara said she feels I don\u2019t care about her health and our grandchild as I have not checked in. That I didnt take ownership. I laughed and told her I would\u2019ve had it all done by now. \n\nShe sent a text telling Karen and I not to speak to her and that she is upset. Karen RSVPed no to Cara\u2019s shower in January and cancelled our trip without telling them. Sean reached out asking us to reconsider saying they will only become parents once and that Cara was 6.5 months pregnant and didn\u2019t mean what she said- he offered to pay for our tickets to come. Karen and I have been firm on our stance however, we told them to let us know well in advance and we can visit in March before or after the baby. Cara is devastated but Karen and I were only trying to accommodate her wishes. \n\nI think I may be the asshole for cancelling my trip knowing Cara is stressed and pregnant.

You were playing expert and you led them down a crappy path that was way more than they signed up for.", "YTA. You don't know as much as you think about construction and left your pregnant daughter to deal with the mess you created. You say you can only work on weekends, however what you started is not a part-time job. You're even more of the asshole that you're actually helping your stepson flip a house that he's not even living in. Your stepson's flip could have waited. Your daughter's pregnancy won't and now she doesn't even have a house that's habitable for a child.", "YTA.\n\nYou are not a contractor but you are someone who lives in Connecticut.

I can say that a pregnant woman having no stove and no sink in months has got to be stressful. You suggesting a tear down in the kitchen was odd. You leaving with 10% of what uou came up to do was odd. You being all NBD and telling them to wait is weird. And you got paid for this? Did I misunderstand something? \n\nAnd you\u2019re not a contractor but you decided to suggest all these changes and didn\u2019t pull permits, left them in the shit with none of it done, and Cara is expecting you to take responsibility for that by acknowledging it, and you\u2019re upset because they fired you? \n\nI can understand a FIL involving himself to help his \u2018kids\u2019 but I can\u2019t understand your thought process to fly up and back to \u2018help\u2019 on a job you were actually paid for.

This is all on you. \n\nMy recommendation to you is to refund them what they paid you and apologize for the disruption in their lives. Or, show up with your tools and stay until it's finished.

As a parent, you have a certain amount of authority that's built on trust. They trusted you to be a good guide and give good advice. Now, it sounds like the kitchen did need extensive repairs, but you didn't give them all the pertinent information about what tearing it out would mean financially, or what it would entail to do that right now.

It isn't a surprise in the US when you buy a home like this, if you read anything about what you are buying. If they didn't do an inspection or didn't read the inspection, that's on them.
