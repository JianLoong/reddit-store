Cara (my daughter) and (her husband) Sean live in MA. \n\nCara is pregnant with their first in March. \n\nIn Sept, my step son gifted new floors to cara and Sean for their kitchen. I offered to help with install. Their home is over 100 years old. I am not a contractor or a carpenter but I am  good at home repairs. I was supposed to only install the floors but during demo, I encouraged them to demo some cabinets so the flooring laid down better. I said I would help with prep on weekends and come back from FL in Nov to assemble new cabinets and install. They agreed. They are new home owners and not handy but were eager to work. The walls ended up being covered in rotting horsehair plaster which was a surprise. When the weekend ended, there was no stove hook up, floors were 10% installed and it was a bit of a mess. I left it to them to plaster the walls that week and I\u2019d come next weekend. \n\nBy Tuesday Cara and Sean called in a panic, saying the plaster was a disaster and that Cara was afraid of the stress on her pregnancy. I told them to wait.  Cara told me she felt mislead and that the project spiraled out of control and asked me to take ownership (not financial) for my hand in their issues. I told them they made their choice to demo and it\u2019s not my house. They paid me for my help and hired contractor. They said I\u2019m not able to commit to a project of this size (I work FT and help my step son with his flip)  and didn\u2019t believe I would come back to help after leaving for FL and Cara is uncomfortable with working during pregnancy, all to which I disagreed. I was hurt they fired me and still am. \n\nIt\u2019s been weird since. I have not reached out to ask about the kitchen or the baby, though they provided scattered updates on the baby and Karen asked about the baby a few times. Recently Cara reached out saying this has been terrible- they had to pull permits from the town, they haven\u2019t had a stove or sink in months. Cara said she feels I don\u2019t care about her health and our grandchild as I have not checked in. That I didnt take ownership. I laughed and told her I would\u2019ve had it all done by now. \n\nShe sent a text telling Karen and I not to speak to her and that she is upset. Karen RSVPed no to Cara\u2019s shower in January and cancelled our trip without telling them. Sean reached out asking us to reconsider saying they will only become parents once and that Cara was 6.5 months pregnant and didn\u2019t mean what she said- he offered to pay for our tickets to come. Karen and I have been firm on our stance however, we told them to let us know well in advance and we can visit in March before or after the baby. Cara is devastated but Karen and I were only trying to accommodate her wishes. \n\nI think I may be the asshole for cancelling my trip knowing Cara is stressed and pregnant.

You were playing expert and you led them down a crappy path that was way more than they signed up for.", "YTA. You don't know as much as you think about construction and left your pregnant daughter to deal with the mess you created. You say you can only work on weekends, however what you started is not a part-time job. You're even more of the asshole that you're actually helping your stepson flip a house that he's not even living in. Your stepson's flip could have waited.

I can say that a pregnant woman having no stove and no sink in months has got to be stressful. You suggesting a tear down in the kitchen was odd.

Did I misunderstand something? \n\nAnd you\u2019re not a contractor but you decided to suggest all these changes and didn\u2019t pull permits, left them in the shit with none of it done, and Cara is expecting you to take responsibility for that by acknowledging it, and you\u2019re upset because they fired you? \n\nI can understand a FIL involving himself to help his \u2018kids\u2019 but I can\u2019t understand your thought process to fly up and back to \u2018help\u2019 on a job you were actually paid for.

As a parent, you have a certain amount of authority that's built on trust. They trusted you to be a good guide and give good advice. Now, it sounds like the kitchen did need extensive repairs, but you didn't give them all the pertinent information about what tearing it out would mean financially, or what it would entail to do that right now.

He was really eager to help when I bought my first house that needed work and I was like \"yes, please, awesome\" because like I said he is really good at fixing stuff and making sure it's done properly.\n\nHe made the first step in fixing something in my house and that was it. After that he was too busy I guess? He never offered to finish it and I felt kinda weird saying \"Hey, are you gonna finish this thing you started?\" Because after all it was a huge favor, didn't think it was my place to push and I know my dad is busy. He doesn't build or fix stuff for a living, he's just really good at it.\n\nLooking back I think the crux of the issue is that to my dad, my house just another project on his to-do list (he was always fixing and improving stuff around his own house and for family so he had a long list), but to me it was my home. So low priority for him, but super high priority for me. And that's the vibe I'm getting from you, OP. You see this as just another project you have no real attachment to but to your daughter and her husband this is the place where they are gonna raise a family and want to make happy memories, etc. It's not just a flip or another project, it's the most important place in their lives. They are emotionally invested in this house in a way you will never be. I'm guessing they feel like they trusted you and you led them astray and then you shrugged and even laughed at them. Honestly I would have banned you from my house. You gonna be so cavalier about my home like that, you aren't gonna be welcome in it.\n\nAnd yeah I \"fired\" my dad as well. Didn't tell him or anything, just decided privately that I would no longer rely on him to do anything around my house, and if that hurt his feelings or he thought it was dumb because he could do it for free, oh well.

I would have cancelled too. Pregnancy aside, stress aside, she definitely should reach out personally if she really feels she said things she didn\u2019t mean and wants you there. Her husband should be pushing her to do that, not reaching out on her behalf to her own parents. \n\nAgain I think ESH and everyone should take responsibility for the situation with the remodel, you were in over your head - but they also are not completely innocent to just accept family help without doing their own homework. Someone needed to be the adult here and a remodel was a bad idea, but shit happens and mistakes are made. \n\nAnyway someone is going to need to grow up here, whether it\u2019s you or her. No husbands or wife\u2019s, you need to talk directly to your daughter. Give her a call, regardless if you go to the shower or not, just pick up the phone. Good luck!", "NTA. Being pregnant is not an excuse to treat someone shitty. I get she\u2019s stressed and her hormones are in overdrive. Again, not an excuse to be nasty. She said what she said and she did mean it.", "okay ian even read this yet like bro why u calling ur wife karen", "YTA for more than just canceling your trip. YTA for the whole kit and caboodle. I feel so bad for your daughter.", "YTA. I went no contact with my father for less.  You seem awful,  I don't understand why they want you in their lives at all. I feel so bad for her.", "YTA for all the reasons people listed here. Go to the shower. You\u2019ll likely regret it if you don\u2019t.", "Wow YTA so hard. Have fun never seeing your future grandchildren and wondering why she won't help you when you're old and feeble and need a home.", "Yta, firstly, unless its your house stop pretending to be a construction worker. To many people think they are handy men when they aren't. Your story sounds very much like you are one such person who doesn't know what they are doing.", "You are the a****** and your attitude shows you the a****** because you think you didn't do anything wrong and you f****** did you you tore up their f****** house and then left when they were speaking to you about it you gave this flippant condescending answer which made it seem like you didn't give a f*** you need to go back and help them or you won't be seeing your grandchild", "So I had to reread a couple times to figure out what you did. I think I have it now. So first weekend you did demo. So tearing out old flooring and carting off. In the process you came across bad plaster that needed replacing. They got overwhelmed with replastering themselves. Freaked out. Fired you in the heat of the moment and insulted you. Ok decision time! ESH you knew they weren't handy. Why on earth would you tell them to fix it themselves without help. You're letting your pride get in the way of celebrating a moment that will only come once. You should've explained what to do and if they weren't comfortable to wait for you on the plaster. Laughing at them and teasing does not help. They should have stepped back and said we can't do this. Freaking out solves nothing. They also need to understand old houses always have hidden problems. Hell you might have to gut a room when you change a light bulb! J/K. Kinda. Now that they hired somebody it's on them. You can't control their reaction to ditch you immediately. Also a new contractor is going to start from scratch. If they hired a bad one they'll be at this for a year. Reach out to your daughter. Apologize for ditching her and the teasing. Let her know that anything she does with that house will spiral a bit. Its old it will happen. You want to be in her life but you will never be a part of any work on the home. Let her decide how she wants to move forward. Also tell her to watch the money pit. It's an over exaggerated version of her life now.", "YTA. Is your pride really THAT important to you that you want to miss out on so many firsts and a chunk of your grandchild's life because you want to stick it to them?\n\nI can certainly see why Cara is upset. Her house is in shambles. While renos are usually always stressful, she has no kitchen. No kitchen and being very pregnant is not a good combination. \n\nAt her stage in the pregnancy there is likely not a lot she is actually physically able to do. I'm sure standing is hard for long periods of time (very uncomfortable as she is carrying a whole baby) and also not able to bend over very well because of said baby. \n\nSo they have essentially been on their own to try and put things back together. They've also encountered some hurdles along the way (as far as the permits are concerned, as well as the plaster).\n\nI think you need to stop being so smug and just admit that you were wrong to encourage them to dismantle the cabinets and then try to move forward from that. \n\nYou aren't a contractor. So their decision to want to move forward with professionals at this stage is smart. You said you would have had this done by now. But I doubt that's the case. \n\nTwo scenarios come to mind:\n\n1) You do the work and all of the problems are still there (because that rotting horsehair plaster would still be there because you may not have found it or known what it was).  And then they end up having to rip everything out and redo it all anyway. \n\nOR\n\n2) You would have dismantled the kitchen, found the horsehair plaster and then proceeded to try and fix it. But because you aren't a professional, you don't know what you are doing and make many costly and time consuming mistakes.\n\nNope. Let the professionals handle this so that it gets done right and in a  timely manner. Apologize and try to move forward and fix the relationship. Pride is only going to give you years of missed time with your family.\n\nDo you want to die right or die having spent quality time with your family all these years? Don't be a scrooge.", "YTA.\n\nSon in law is extending you grace for what's likely to be the last time.

You\u2019ve got some serious sucking up to do, dude.", "YTA. Get your ass back to MA and apologize in person. Both you and your wife. \n\nAnd then do everything possible to fix the situation, and their kitchen. Your pride is going to destroy your family. \n\nAnd your kid is right, they will only have their 1st child once. \n\nMan the fuck up, Grandpa.", "YTA \n\nI get it though, you aren't a contractor you just like to pretend to be one until you get in over your head.", "I\u2019m trying really hard to not say a boomer joke, because of how blind you seem to be to the problem *you.* created. \n\nYTA. You created a huge reno problem, in the home of a pregnant person, then just abandoned ship.", "You encouraged them to do the demo, left them to do something you know they were not skilled at, refused to accept that you contributed to the problem, then got mad when they got a contractor because they couldn't wait for you to get around to it, so you've essentially ignored them, and when she called you on it, you laughed at her predicament. Not only that, but your wife passive aggressively cancelled on attending the baby shower. You are terrible parents. It sounds like a good thing that you're gone half the year so your daughter and coming grandchild don't have to deal with the disappointment as much.  YTA.", "\"Florida man\"", "YTA I cannot understand why OP is so offended by this.\n\nThe daughter and husband really shouldn't be surprised in my opinion. Old houses usually come with surprise work and need previously unknown repairs. It seems like this was a very big commitment that was not well thought out by either party. \n\nThe same exact phrasing as above can also be used with OP. This project may have started simple, but it clearly got out of hand. OP would be responsible to recognize that this is beyond his scope and leave it to some professionals. If anything, that would be a stress relief for EVERYONE. Instead, OP insisted they continue to suffer in a barely livable home while he travels to and from Florida between his TWO livable homes. \n\nConstruction is not typically a safe job, add in a pregnancy and a 100 year old house and that is a terrible combination. \n\nOP it is probably a good idea to just accept and communicate that this was above your scope of work and apologize for how it all went down. Its okay to not be an expert at home renovation. \n\nYTA.

I can't even.", "ESH - they trusted your opinion and recommendation, but ultimately it was their choice. They are understandably upset that the work moved from flooring to a total Reno, and would like for you to acknowledge that your recommendation was not a great one.

Is the water to the house still off? \n\nYou really expect them to be ok with that giant mess when she\u2019s pregnant!? She is supposed to be getting the house ready for baby.

Your pregnant daughter shouldn't be trying to fix up a house without guidance in the first place. Furthermore, they don't have a functioning kitchen which they really should have considering baby on the way. You're fortunate if all they've done at this point is go no or low contact.

YTA\n\nOld houses when renovating are like a rabbit hole of problems once you start. I don't do construction but just watching a remodeling show should be enough to know that this was never going to be a simple project. You tore up their kitchen, exposed your unborn grandchild to dangerous chemicals, and left them without a kitchen for months. \nI would be seething. Not to mention that kind of stress could send her into early labor! \n\nYou were lucky to still be invited to that baby shower.
