Cara (my daughter) and (her husband) Sean live in MA. \n\nCara is pregnant with their first in March. \n\nIn Sept, my step son gifted new floors to cara and Sean for their kitchen. I offered to help with install. Their home is over 100 years old. I am not a contractor or a carpenter but I am  good at home repairs. I was supposed to only install the floors but during demo, I encouraged them to demo some cabinets so the flooring laid down better. I said I would help with prep on weekends and come back from FL in Nov to assemble new cabinets and install. They agreed. They are new home owners and not handy but were eager to work. The walls ended up being covered in rotting horsehair plaster which was a surprise. When the weekend ended, there was no stove hook up, floors were 10% installed and it was a bit of a mess. I left it to them to plaster the walls that week and I\u2019d come next weekend. \n\nBy Tuesday Cara and Sean called in a panic, saying the plaster was a disaster and that Cara was afraid of the stress on her pregnancy. I told them to wait.  Cara told me she felt mislead and that the project spiraled out of control and asked me to take ownership (not financial) for my hand in their issues. I told them they made their choice to demo and it\u2019s not my house. They paid me for my help and hired contractor. They said I\u2019m not able to commit to a project of this size (I work FT and help my step son with his flip)  and didn\u2019t believe I would come back to help after leaving for FL and Cara is uncomfortable with working during pregnancy, all to which I disagreed. I was hurt they fired me and still am. \n\nIt\u2019s been weird since. I have not reached out to ask about the kitchen or the baby, though they provided scattered updates on the baby and Karen asked about the baby a few times. Recently Cara reached out saying this has been terrible- they had to pull permits from the town, they haven\u2019t had a stove or sink in months. Cara said she feels I don\u2019t care about her health and our grandchild as I have not checked in. That I didnt take ownership. I laughed and told her I would\u2019ve had it all done by now. \n\nShe sent a text telling Karen and I not to speak to her and that she is upset. Karen RSVPed no to Cara\u2019s shower in January and cancelled our trip without telling them. Sean reached out asking us to reconsider saying they will only become parents once and that Cara was 6.5 months pregnant and didn\u2019t mean what she said- he offered to pay for our tickets to come. Karen and I have been firm on our stance however, we told them to let us know well in advance and we can visit in March before or after the baby. Cara is devastated but Karen and I were only trying to accommodate her wishes. \n\nI think I may be the asshole for cancelling my trip knowing Cara is stressed and pregnant.

You were playing expert and you led them down a crappy path that was way more than they signed up for.", "YTA. You don't know as much as you think about construction and left your pregnant daughter to deal with the mess you created. You say you can only work on weekends, however what you started is not a part-time job. You're even more of the asshole that you're actually helping your stepson flip a house that he's not even living in. Your stepson's flip could have waited. Your daughter's pregnancy won't and now she doesn't even have a house that's habitable for a child.", "YTA.\n\nYou are not a contractor but you are someone who lives in Connecticut.

I can say that a pregnant woman having no stove and no sink in months has got to be stressful. You suggesting a tear down in the kitchen was odd. You leaving with 10% of what uou came up to do was odd. You being all NBD and telling them to wait is weird. And you got paid for this? Did I misunderstand something? \n\nAnd you\u2019re not a contractor but you decided to suggest all these changes and didn\u2019t pull permits, left them in the shit with none of it done, and Cara is expecting you to take responsibility for that by acknowledging it, and you\u2019re upset because they fired you? \n\nI can understand a FIL involving himself to help his \u2018kids\u2019 but I can\u2019t understand your thought process to fly up and back to \u2018help\u2019 on a job you were actually paid for.

This is all on you. \n\nMy recommendation to you is to refund them what they paid you and apologize for the disruption in their lives. Or, show up with your tools and stay until it's finished.

As a parent, you have a certain amount of authority that's built on trust. They trusted you to be a good guide and give good advice. Now, it sounds like the kitchen did need extensive repairs, but you didn't give them all the pertinent information about what tearing it out would mean financially, or what it would entail to do that right now.

Daughter was freaking out and hired a contractor to finish what she said OP could not commit to.  Now, months later..nothing is done? That's on her and her hubby.  They decided to go with a contractor to finish the job. Well, that didn't work out well since it's been months and it seems like nothing is getting done.  Then she calls and complains to Dad as if it's dad's fault the contractor they hired is dragging the work out. Not his problem. She fired him from the job and hired a contractor.  Her and her hubby need to take that stance with the contractor. If she wants her Dad there she should call and ask him. If she did im sure Dad would say yes. Don't send your hubby to clean up the messthat you made.  Daughter needs to call and say she didn't mean it.  It means nothing coming from hubby.", "ESH \n\nWhen you start working on any house, especially an old one, an experienced contractor or DIY person will allow extra time and money because  'things'  will be found. 100% and always.

Or they're not willing to listen.\n\n Swallow your pride and help these people get this done before that baby comes. Be a calming influence and go between for the contractors. Foolishness all around.", "ESH.  The only thing you should apologize for is making it seem like you were more invested in the project than you actually were and not explaining risks. It was not your priority, but you had given a well meaning suggestion, but assumed they knew what they were doing or could figure it out and you know what they say about assumptions. I also feel you did not explain possible risks about what could happen if something went wrong.\n\nAs for everything else, it is kind of on them. They should not have started work before figuring out what it would entail, particularly with regards to demolition and construction. They should have consulted a professional to understand what you had proposed and get an idea of what was being done.\n\nAlso please tell them they can get an induction cooktop.", ">\"they haven't had a stove or sink in months\"\n\nThat's what gets me the most here.

My parents decided to tear down the crumbling plaster and put up sheet rock. What a surprise - literally nothing was squared. So, before they installed sheet rock, everything needed to be squared. It's taken almost 20 years to get it all done, but at least we had a functional kitchen and bathroom throughout. I can't imagine the stress of being pregnant and not having a functional kitchen.\n\nYTA, OP.

Preparing for a baby is a lot.\n\nHome renovations are a huge burden and as someone who has been through this life you definitely knew how this could go. Instead of hearing your DIL and how she was overwhelmed with the choices they made based on your recommendations was your first chance to step up and go above and beyond to make things easier for them.\n\nThis whole experience for them has now been so stressful I'm sure. \nThey are enough by themselves to push someone over the top...\n\nI get that you feel you were only trying to help but it sounds like it had the opposite effect, maybe see about helping get a contractor in there to put the house back together?", "From what I umderstand Demo was not his job, but theirs. It appears they did jot finish in time for him to install the floors if he was making suggestions durong demo. He works full time and asked them to wait one week for him to finish it the next weekend. Instead they flipped a lid, told him everything was his fault and fired him because they had to handle the walls. Its not uncommon to install a floor around a gas appliance so the lack of a stove hookup seems like an error in demo.", "He told them up front he would only work on weekends and they fired him before he could come back to work on it?

He wanted to gift new floors to OP\u2019s daughter and spouse and OP was going to help with the installation.  I don\u2019t think they are trying to flip the house they were just foolish enough to accept a gift that had a huge probability of going longer than intended.  Also you\u2019re right old house projects always have surprises that make them much bigger projects.  I do think OP kinda sucks for convincing them to do the cabinets and being busy after only doing 10% of the project.", "To be fair Cara admitted her and her husbands mistake in the demo but wanted me to apologize for encouraging them to continue demoing I do not feel as though I need to apologize as I said I could\u2019ve finished the job and she didn\u2019t give me a chance to fix the issues.", "Well OP can't take responsibility for his role in this either so perhaps it runs in the family.

Yes it's their house but they were following your advice.", "OP is pulling identical shit, I'm just giving perspective from the other side.

Now the contractor hasn't done crap and instead of her meeting with the contractor she calls and  blames you and makes a rash decision to say she doesn't want to see you.  That's all on her. Now she regrets what she said and sends her hubby to grovel.  She should call you and ask you to come not her hubby.  If she does, I think you and wife should go.  I wouldn't discuss anything or give any advice regarding the construction. She fired you. The contractor she hired and her and her husband lack of setting timeliness with the contractor is the reason she doesn't have a stove and sink after several months.

Ripping all of this out also meant they would not be able to use the stove or the kitchen sink until the repairs were completely done. OP has also said in some comments that before he was completely cutoff, he gave them \"advice\" to not listen to a contractor because OP felt the contractor was up selling a service. \n\nHad OP just done what was requested originally, none of this would have happened.
