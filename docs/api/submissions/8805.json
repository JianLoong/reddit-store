He has full custody of his son who is 9. My ex and I have three boys who are 7, 9 and 13yo boys. The boys get along with each other. I put in the same as my ex and Ross does into getting along with me. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't.\n\nI have 50/50 custody of my kids and if we're doing something fun, I'd invite Ross's son to tag along. That's the limit of my involvement with his kid.\n\nI'm pretty involved with my kids' school and was wondering when they were going to start the puberty talk with my 9yo's class. My 13yo had already started it. I asked my son's teacher and he said they're starting next month. I mentioned that I'd like to see the material before I sign the permission slip and he said that it was already signed.\n\nI said I did not sign anything. Ross did. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was some mistake. There wasn't. He said he signed the permission slip for my son and his son. \n\nI asked why and he asked me if I was joking. I  said I wasn't. He said that he didn't think anything of it. He signs them out at school, is an emergency contact, gives the 7yo a bath, cooks for them and both boys had asked him questions. If he does all that, then how is signing off on puberty class such a big deal. He just signed them when he went through their homework folder. Yes, my ex knew about it.\n\nHe told me that he felt totally comfortable doing it. I told him he shouldn't feel comfortable with it. I wanted to know what was going to be discussed and have a discussion before and after he got the puberty talk at school. \n\nHe said \"you know your son told and showed me things that are happening to his body and I wouldn't be mad if you talked to my kid about puberty. It's okay.\"\n\nThen my ex and I got into it. She said I can't pick and choose what Ross does as a step-dad. So I rescinded the permission slip and they're calling me petty.

He has full custody of his son who is 9. My ex and I have three boys who are 7, 9 and 13yo boys. The boys get along with each other. I put in the same as my ex and Ross does into getting along with me. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't.\n\nI have 50/50 custody of my kids and if we're doing something fun, I'd invite Ross's son to tag along. That's the limit of my involvement with his kid.\n\nI'm pretty involved with my kids' school and was wondering when they were going to start the puberty talk with my 9yo's class. My 13yo had already started it. I asked my son's teacher and he said they're starting next month. I mentioned that I'd like to see the material before I sign the permission slip and he said that it was already signed.\n\nI said I did not sign anything. Ross did. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was some mistake. There wasn't. He said he signed the permission slip for my son and his son. \n\nI asked why and he asked me if I was joking. I  said I wasn't. He said that he didn't think anything of it. He signs them out at school, is an emergency contact, gives the 7yo a bath, cooks for them and both boys had asked him questions. If he does all that, then how is signing off on puberty class such a big deal. He just signed them when he went through their homework folder. Yes, my ex knew about it.\n\nHe told me that he felt totally comfortable doing it. I told him he shouldn't feel comfortable with it. I wanted to know what was going to be discussed and have a discussion before and after he got the puberty talk at school. \n\nHe said \"you know your son told and showed me things that are happening to his body and I wouldn't be mad if you talked to my kid about puberty. It's okay.\"\n\nThen my ex and I got into it. She said I can't pick and choose what Ross does as a step-dad. So I rescinded the permission slip and they're calling me petty. I hate that our kids feel that tension but oh well.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Only the bio parents should sign this kind of thing. Ross isn't a parent. Your ex should have signed it. \n\nYTA as is Ross and your ex. This is just basic courtesy. Your ex should have said, Hey, Ross, let me sign that and make sure Dad is cool with it. Ross shouldn't have gone on as he did. He may have all sorts of permissions, but he's not the legal parent. You shouldn't have revoked permission. You're all AH.\n\n-SM for years\nedit for spelling", "Yta yay! Let's hurt the kid to get back at the step dad!  Spot on parenting. \n\nWith all the neglectful or abusive step parents out there, how about you be freaken happy that you're kids have one more loving adult in their life?", "Esh- I think you kind of got heated quick but I do understand.

This screams petty", "YTA. 100%.", "Do you acknowledge that YTA for rescinding the permission slip just to be petty?

It sounds like Ross is a decent stepfather and close with your kids, so you should have spoken to your ex about this first, to clarify how you would like things to go.  \nI actually agree with you that Ross should not be signing slips for you child, who has 2 parents to do that, you and his mom.  Frankly the school should not accept a slip signed by anyone else.", "yta, you should be thanking this guy, not being petty.", "YTA. And a controlling one at that.

This education is vital for developing kids and you\u2019re purposely trying to keep your kid from that out of some weird petty behavior.

Decisions about what they are taught should be handled different than say a permission slip to go to the zoo.

Although abstinence was taught as the only proven method of birth control/STI prevention that was 100% effective, it was not the only one discussed. It's mind boggling to think that some states don't even teach where babies come from/how they're made. It's even crazier that they scratch their heads at their higher rates of teen pregnancy and STI compared to states with comprehensive sex ed.\n\nEdit: grammar/spelling", "My ex tried to prevent daughter from getting sex Ed.

She told me go get the books I wanted, it was time to check out.  The librarian was spluttering and gasping about how inappropriate it was.

It was just the facts.\n\nIn high school, we learned that using multiple forms of birth control was more effective than just using one method. We learned about STDs. I think our education was quite good.", "That's the point of the permission slips in the first place. They are giving the child permission to attend the class.

I'm pretty sure there's even states where you can sign your kid out of certain science lessons, if they're teaching evolution in that lesson. Supreme court ruled that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children, 'ain't no government gonna tell me what my kid has to learn'...
