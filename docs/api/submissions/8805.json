He has full custody of his son who is 9. My ex and I have three boys who are 7, 9 and 13yo boys. The boys get along with each other. I put in the same as my ex and Ross does into getting along with me. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't.\n\nI have 50/50 custody of my kids and if we're doing something fun, I'd invite Ross's son to tag along. That's the limit of my involvement with his kid.\n\nI'm pretty involved with my kids' school and was wondering when they were going to start the puberty talk with my 9yo's class. My 13yo had already started it. I asked my son's teacher and he said they're starting next month. I mentioned that I'd like to see the material before I sign the permission slip and he said that it was already signed.\n\nI said I did not sign anything. Ross did. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was some mistake. There wasn't. He said he signed the permission slip for my son and his son. \n\nI asked why and he asked me if I was joking. I  said I wasn't. He said that he didn't think anything of it. He signs them out at school, is an emergency contact, gives the 7yo a bath, cooks for them and both boys had asked him questions. If he does all that, then how is signing off on puberty class such a big deal. He just signed them when he went through their homework folder. Yes, my ex knew about it.\n\nHe told me that he felt totally comfortable doing it. I told him he shouldn't feel comfortable with it. I wanted to know what was going to be discussed and have a discussion before and after he got the puberty talk at school. \n\nHe said \"you know your son told and showed me things that are happening to his body and I wouldn't be mad if you talked to my kid about puberty. It's okay.\"\n\nThen my ex and I got into it. She said I can't pick and choose what Ross does as a step-dad. So I rescinded the permission slip and they're calling me petty.

He has full custody of his son who is 9. My ex and I have three boys who are 7, 9 and 13yo boys. The boys get along with each other. I put in the same as my ex and Ross does into getting along with me. Sometimes we do, sometimes we don't.\n\nI have 50/50 custody of my kids and if we're doing something fun, I'd invite Ross's son to tag along. That's the limit of my involvement with his kid.\n\nI'm pretty involved with my kids' school and was wondering when they were going to start the puberty talk with my 9yo's class. My 13yo had already started it. I asked my son's teacher and he said they're starting next month. I mentioned that I'd like to see the material before I sign the permission slip and he said that it was already signed.\n\nI said I did not sign anything. Ross did. I gave him the benefit of the doubt that maybe there was some mistake. There wasn't. He said he signed the permission slip for my son and his son. \n\nI asked why and he asked me if I was joking. I  said I wasn't. He said that he didn't think anything of it. He signs them out at school, is an emergency contact, gives the 7yo a bath, cooks for them and both boys had asked him questions. If he does all that, then how is signing off on puberty class such a big deal. He just signed them when he went through their homework folder. Yes, my ex knew about it.\n\nHe told me that he felt totally comfortable doing it. I told him he shouldn't feel comfortable with it. I wanted to know what was going to be discussed and have a discussion before and after he got the puberty talk at school. \n\nHe said \"you know your son told and showed me things that are happening to his body and I wouldn't be mad if you talked to my kid about puberty. It's okay.\"\n\nThen my ex and I got into it. She said I can't pick and choose what Ross does as a step-dad. So I rescinded the permission slip and they're calling me petty.

Now when I think back to my old school days for this class, it was all \"growth spurts, hair in new places, why you need deodorant, and what these new feelings of attraction are\". That all seems pretty reasonable at this point, where I can see why the stepdad would feel pretty comfortable signing that off with mum's nod. This perspective is also supported by the first kids having already started it.\n\nHowever, OP clearly disagrees with that perspective, to the point of literally going to the school to withdraw permission, which in this context, is a pretty extreme thing to do. \n\nCommunication has broken down between the three parental figures, and parenting styles between dad and stepdad are now clashing. Understanding why OP so passionately wanted to be consulted about what seems to be a bit of admin is very important. Is there part of the content he's concerned about? Is he feeling left out of the decision making in general? Had they already discussed this puberty class previously specifically? Or school permission slips in general? \n\nTo say that the stepdad doesn't have business signing forms is questionable, considering his relationship to the kids.  If OP wants to discuss every bit of admin the school sends home, that's his prerogative. But these roles needs to be established between the now three parents. Him getting made because two parents made a judgement call he didn't like over a thing they didn't talk about doesn't help anyone.\n\nHaving one parent lose their shit because they felt slighted by the other two is bad for everyone, especially the kids, and this is where OP may be the AH.", "There is no reason to pull the permission without reviewing the material.

It sounds like he was blind sided by this and only found out by luck when he asked the teacher. Then he overreacted.\n\nHe wanted to have a pre and post talk with his children before they were taught, and not knowing when it is happening would rob him of that.
