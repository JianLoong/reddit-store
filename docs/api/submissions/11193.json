Whoever loses the most weight by the end of February wins $250, second-place $100, third-place $50. A few people were excited, just coming off of their New Years resolutions, and so they signed up and weighed themselves at work to get their starting weight.\n\nMy friend and coworker heard about this, and she complained. She said (and I agree with her) that the competition is body-shaming, it promotes unhealthy eating habits, and it encourages people to eat in a way that is unsustainable and will leave them feeling worse about themselves. Or it was something like this, she explained it more eloquently. Point is, she was upset and for good reason. But the boss shut her down.\n\nIn my infinite wisdom, I decided I would join the competition just to show them how stupid it really is. For context, I\u2019m a young guy (25M) at a pretty healthy weight (6\u20191, 190lbs). I guess my logic was, if I could win it, then it\u2019s a bullshit competition because it\u2019s supposed to be for people who need to lose weight. I\u2019d been bulking for a few months, so I decided I would do a cut. I ate my rice, spinach, and chicken breasts and drank lots of water up until Feb 26. Then, the night before, I barely ate all day. I went to judo class and hit the exercise bike in heavy layers to lose some extra water weight. I wrestled in college, so I knew how to cut weight and I did it carefully and safely. \n\nThe day of, I weighed myself. 177, so 13 pounds lost. Nobody else even came close, the boss lost like 9.5 pounds or something. Everyone was shocked and annoyed at me right after I weighed myself and I was drinking my Pedialite (the shit they give to dehydrated babies). They told me I was too skinny already, why\u2019d I have to enter the competition, etc. They said I cheated by cutting water weight, but I said they all probably mostly lost water weight too. The worst thing is, my friend was mad at me too! I thought she\u2019d be happy with me that I exposed this competition for the bullshit that it was, but I guess not. I offered to give her the money I won as an apology, which was fucking stupid of me, and she of course said no and now isn\u2019t talking to me.", "created_utc": 1677663128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ezgal/aita_for_ruining_a_weight_loss_competition/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Losing weight is not something you should do for a competition or financial gain but for yourself and your health (if needed).", "YTA.  I say this not because the competition was a good idea, but because there wasn\u2019t really a good reason to believe your actions would really open anyone\u2019s eyes.

A fit young man with your knowledge can do this much easier than an overweight or obese lady in her 40s, that gained the baby weight and has a slowing metabolism. Plus you didn't need to participate. These people wanted to get in better shape and this was a good incentive for them, this wasn't for you. Plus losing more than 2 lbs per week isn't considered healthy anyway, which you also did. \n\nNTA for realizing this wasn't the right approach to promote achieving a healthier weight in the long term. Might help them realize this, but your actions didn't help find a solution.", "NTA. My prior workplace did these stupid competitions like twice year.

There's a reason overweight people get more sick and die sooner, if people die sooner companies earn less long-term due to having to hire and train new people so in the end companies do this because healthy people are worth investing in. Basically the money is a carrot on a stick. But even so it doesn't make the way they did it right, but as well as didn't make what you did right. Did you even think about your actions thoroughly? Or did you hothead yourself into this competition not thinking you might cause someone with ED to get triggered seeing you?", "Sometimes there are people who struggle to lose weight who look for motivation - you are lucky you love excercise and are good at keeping fit and are a healthy weight - not struggling. Others sometimes need a little tiny incentive to stick to something - once you start and get over the first few days its easier to stick to- but the mental block before then can take months or years. You who dont have an issue with your weight took that away from others. Collectively they had a goal, they shared the journey and then you took their actual hard work away.\n\nHonestly it can take months be able to commit to eating healthily and just simply getting back to going for long  walks -  before then I find so many excuses and am in a depressive slump about it -  if something small like competition made people stick to it and be happy with their achievements why did you take that away?\n\nInstead of sabotaging it for those who want it - you could have thought of other ways to improve it and make it better.\n\nGive the money back to the person who won 2nd and apologise. And if you have cleverer ways that actually help motivate people then act rather than just talk.", "NTA. Good job on hacking the competitor and enjoy your winnings. Your coworkers sound like a bunch of salty losers.  Your friend sounds exhausting. And your boss learns a valuable lesson in defining his competitions better.", "NTA. You proved your point (which is valid, I agree), but to what end?  I doubt they get it, or care.  If your boss is dumb enough to try this again, betcha anything those same coworkers will, too.

All of the people that entered were older women looking for motivation to lose weight except one young guy who'd carb load excessively leading up to the first weigh in (it was always the same time of year so he'd start a month or so before). Then he'd cut like a madman and win by a landslide. He wasn't subtle about it at all, so I can't hate the hustle, but damn did it kinda feel shitty watching nice old ladies lose like 1-5lbs and get destroyed by a young dude :(", "Imma go against the grain, apparently, but definitely NTA for winning.\n\nAs someone who's been the whole range XS to XL, the first 10 pounds are more or less water weight and are definitely easier to lose if you're bigger than if you're already slim/fit, so your colleagues actually had the advantage. In the long run, you have a faster, younger metabolism and would definitely win, but in two months if your colleagues had gone on a serious diet (cutting out all added sugar, fizzy drinks, lots of water and no cheat days, etc.) and had known a few tricks (no food/water 12h before weigh-in) they could have matched your loss. \n\nIt was a stupid competition, but why should we rip into a young healthy guy who kinda foolishly took it as a challenge but actually did the work? Why should you donate the money to placate others? Donate if you want, by all means, it would be a cool thing to do, but stop apologising for winning. Unless you took cookies and candy to work during those months, you won fair and square.
