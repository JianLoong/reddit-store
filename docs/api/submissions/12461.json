You're NTA.", "NTA. He blocked you. What exactly does he expect to happen? The fact that you paid it this long is a grace period I wouldn't have offered. The GF has fuck all to do with his shitty communication.", "NTA.\nThe new girlfriend is irrelevant. If he hadn't blocked you, the polite thing to do would be to tell someone they have until X date to port their number, but he's removed that option by blocking you. There's cheap unlimited plans for $15/month, he should have taken care of it before the first post-breakup bill hit.", "Eh. At first I was gonna say AH. Loosing your number can really effect a lot of people. But he blocked you, on the phone you're paying for, while you have a cold together?  Trash. NTA.", "NTA. \n\nIt is time he experience the \"find out\" portion of \"fuck around and...\" - get him off that plan ASAP.", "Girl, shut that shit down asap. Regardless of everything else, once he blocked you that was the end of that. You owe him nothing, and it's not like phone plans take a while to go into effect. He can go into a store and walk out with a working phone, there's no reason to give him notice.", "NTA He's had three months to figure out his finances, and you've been more than generous by continuing to pay for his phone. If he can't afford his own phone, he can't afford a girlfriend.", "NTA! Kick him off that plan! If he wants to see his child he\u2019ll find a way to get ahold of you, let him be an adult who pays for his own phone.", "NTA you asked for payment for his part. You messaged him as the owner of the phone line and he blocked you. You have every right to take him off your bill. He'll for sure call you the asshole but you are completely within your right.", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay for the phone. Doesn\u2019t matter whether he\u2019s using it to text a new girl, his mum, or bloody Vladimir Putin. \n\nBe calm and respectful, document everything, don\u2019t let on to your child about any of the problems. Disconnect from the man financially in every conceivable way because you will not see that money again. Seek legal advice if you have to especially regarding custody. Takers are going to take if you let them.", "He is an ah, hope you have the legal paperwork on support properly squared away. NTA.", "Yeah NTA. There are plenty of affordable plans out there for him.", "NTA, take him off, you owe him nothing.", "NTA- Part of the point of a break up is two people acknowledging that they are no longer associated and no longer responsible for the stability and future of the other one. You are SPLIT.   \nIt's not your fault he didn't get his whole self together. It's not your fault he's not prepared to be independent. You're as responsible for your ex as I am, and I certainly feel no need to help a random adult man with his bills when i got my own. \n\nThat doesn't mean it will be easy when you do, whether you give him a warning or not he is going to whine, he'll argue, he'll make you feel bad, and he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants without having to put in more effort. \n\nI'd probably give one more warning just to have something in writing for whatever happens next. Something like \"I'm turning closing the line in 2 days\" just to have that you made that clear, but that's more a CYA thing than AH thing.", "No, NTA. You are not bound to pay for an ex boyfriend/girlfriend forever even if they do not have as much funds as they would like. He blocked you, so you can't even give him updates on his child. That os unbelievable. Straight to jail. Be careful about mixing finances in the future.", "NTA.\n\nHe's not your husband, child, or dependent. There's no reason for you to keep him on your phone plan. Everything else is irrelevant.", "NTA, tell him he has a week to figure his shit out then you're canceling it. If he doesn't transfer the number before you cancel he'll have to get a new number and deal with that whole bullshit", "NTA. Why are you even asking this question? He should have BEEN off your plan. Do it now!", "NTA. Whether or not he has a girlfriend is irrelevant. You have no obligation to pay for his phone. However, if the phone is on a lease tied to your phone plan, you will have to pay it off before you can take him off the plan", "NTA. No warnings, just cut him off.", "NTA - Cut him off immediately and let him learn about \"money issues\" when you whack him with a child support order, which should be your very next item of business if it isn't already in process.  If he's got money to romance a new GF, he can f'ing well pay support for his child.  Take him for every $ you can get for your child's benefit.", "NTA. He blocked you so you can't tell him anything. \n\nREMOVE him immediately.  The guy is a parasite.", "YWNBTA. He's had 3 months to get a new phone contract. Cut him off yours now. His new girlfriend can pay for it if she wants. I'm more concerned that you ensure you get child support from this lowlife than that he has a phone.", "NTA. If he\u2019s in the US Mint is $15 a month for unlimited. Let him pay to talk to his girlfriend when he can\u2019t be bothered to speak to your child and thinks it\u2019s acceptable to block you. He\u2019s your ex for a reason. Cut the cord.", "NTA Quit wasting time and cut him off already. He's a big boy and if he hasn't sorted it by now, it's his problem not yours.", "NTA\n\nI would have taken him off as soon as you broke up.  You don't need to be paying for his phone regardless of his job situation... not your problem plus 3 months is plenty of time to figure it out.", "NTA throw him off so hard that he bounces.", "NTA\n\nYou have no reason to be paying for his phone plan at this stage. If he's not going to pony up money for his part in the plan, he can very well spend it on his own.", "NTA.  3 months is long enough for him to have things figured out.  \n\nSide note: you seem angry and hurt, which I totally get. But please don't speak negatively of him in front of your child.  He is still your child's Dad.", "NTA He has moved on and unless there is a court order that says you have to pay for his phone, just turn it off and move on with your life.", "NTA NTA NTA!!! shut it off and report the phone as stolen!!\n\nYoure nicer than I am.

I only found out because he used his new phone number to text my friend (that he was in love with) asking if she wanted to stay in contact (spoiler alert, she did not and immediately sent me the text) best of luck to you!!!", "NTA.  Just shut it off.  No pay, no play. If you really want to be nice about it, ask for him to pay half or it gets shut off. Don't argue about it, just honor his choice accordingly.   And his money problems are no longer your problems.", "NTA, but I would personally give him a warning, just so he can make the accommodations to keep the same number in the amount of time that you would give him.", "NTA. Relationship is over and you shouldn\u2019t be paying for him to speak to his new squeeze.", "YWBTA. If the previous agreement was that you were paying the phone desipte not being together, then him moving on to a new girlfriend does not have any bearing on this.\n\nSo, change the terms of the agreement.
