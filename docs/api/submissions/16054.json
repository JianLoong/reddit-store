However, he doesn't seem to be very careful about where he walks and often gets mud and dirt all over his shoes. Recently, he came over to our house and I noticed that he had a lot of dirt on his shoes. I politely asked him to take his shoes off, but he refused, saying that he couldn't take his shoe off because it was attached to his prosthetic leg. I explained to him that I didn't want the dirt to get on our carpets and that I was concerned about the hygiene of our home, but he still refused. I eventually had to ask him to leave, which caused a big argument between us and my wife. She thinks that I was being unreasonable and that I should have just let her dad come in, dirty shoes and all. However, I feel like I have a right to keep my home clean and hygienic, especially since we have young children who play on the floor.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1682859890, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133p8bo/aita_for_not_allowing_my_wifes_dad_to_come_into/", "score": 312, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, he doesn't seem to be very careful about where he walks and often gets mud and dirt all over his shoes. Recently, he came over to our house and I noticed that he had a lot of dirt on his shoes. I politely asked him to take his shoes off, but he refused, saying that he couldn't take his shoe off because it was attached to his prosthetic leg. I explained to him that I didn't want the dirt to get on our carpets and that I was concerned about the hygiene of our home, but he still refused. I eventually had to ask him to leave, which caused a big argument between us and my wife. She thinks that I was being unreasonable and that I should have just let her dad come in, dirty shoes and all. However, I feel like I have a right to keep my home clean and hygienic, especially since we have young children who play on the floor.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Explain that lately, your family has been tracking dirt into the house more on their shoes so you had tried to institute a no shoes inside policy. (It should be clear that this is a \"people\" issue not a \"him\" issue.) Unfortunately, you hadn't considered the limitations of his shoe.

But make sure that EVERYONE knows that booties are available for people who want to keep their shoes on. Even if no one else takes advantage of it, it needs to be known that everyone can access and use them. Not just him.
