Children only react as well as they are taught to react to upsetting/disappointing experiences. Calling a child names puts the blame on them when in reality they were not given the tools to react in a more appropriate way. It also can really impact their self esteem if they internalize that they are \u201cbad\u201d. \nMy mom called us spoiled brats growing up which is very shitty because she is the one that raised us. It\u2019s not like we grew on trees, we were learning how to act from her. It hurt my feelings more that she ever knew. \n\nAs others pointed out, such a strong reaction could be indicating ASD or other disorders, so that is worth looking into. If your nephew routinely throws a tantrum over everything, that\u2019s a behavioral issue.

Mustard\u2026yikes!", "This. Mustard is something that will spoil the entire sandwich if you're not into it. He shouldn't have reacted that way, but he is a kid and kids sometimes blow their top.

I wonder if my kids will end up in therapy bc I forgot to cut their sandwich into squares when they wanted triangles? You are on the autism spectrum, which maybe this kid it too, but if he is, OP doesn\u2019t know that. If she did, she might have made extra sure his was wrapped by itself.", "It's because people are assuming he must have some sort of disorder, which is causing him to act like this. Which is stupid. His mum's behaviour of just letting her son yell at OP like that and then having a go at *them* when they barely even punished him for his behaviour shows *exactly* why he acts like that. He's a spoilt brat because she lets him act like one. If he continued to act this way despite his mother behaving like a normal parent who punishes their kid for that kind of behaviour, I'd be fully on board with the whole \"he's probably got a problem\" thing, but so far, all I know from this post is he's a child whose mum lets him scream and shout at people when he doesn't get his way, and actually confronts people when they retaliate because *she* can't be bothered to do anything about her own kids behaviour.\n\nIf it turns out he's autistic/has ADHD or some kind of ED that OP just left out, Y T A / E S H, but until then, NTA OP.

That's not an insult, it's just a reasonable rule to make.", "I'm saying that repeatedly (per OPs admittance that this has happened numerous times before) being obtuse about the child's food preferences to the point of asking them what they want and still doing NOTHING to accommodate the child is fucked. As an adult, how often are you pressured/forced to eat things you dislike?... Never, because you buy what you like. Kids don't have that luxury, so we as adults should accommodate their likes and dislikes the same way we accommodate ourselves. You have your needs met and they deserve their's met too.", "First of all, making mistakes with food can be deadly and OP has no way of knowing if customers are picky or allergic. If sandwiches are wrapped so badly that they routinely get condiments on each other, that\u2019s a problem OP really needs to address.\n\nAnd customers who throw tantrums are absolutely in the wrong but they\u2019re also an unavoidable part of any service industry. A lot of times, you have to suck it up and make an asshole customer a new sandwich if you want to have a successful business.", "They should apologize for a free sandwich? To a kid to screamed at them? Nope.", "Numerous and few are different descriptors. Do you know how many times I\u2019ve accidentally burnt my kid\u2019s grilled cheese? She did plenty to accommodate, and then made a mistake. No one pressured him to eat it. Where did you read that? His mom made him something else. He absolutely has a choice. Raising your kids the way you are talking about is going to give them \u201ccenter of the universe\u201d syndrome.", "I fully agree with you that it was spoiled brat behavior, but I think that getting mad and calling the kid names doesn\u00b4t model good behavior for him either.\n\nIf he is throwing tantrums like this at 11 (assuming he is neurotypical) then he has not been taught to use his words instead of scream. I think it is safe to assume that sister has always just given in when he screams, rather than nipping the tantrum in the bud and teaching him to use his words (of course when he was old enough to understand, which was way before age 11).\n\nSo to me, if uncle says calmly and firmly that it isn\u00b4t nice behavior and the consequence is no more sandwiches, that is enough and he doesn\u00b4t need to add on the brat part. Uncle isn\u00b4t so much the disciplinarian but uncle can definitely say that your actions have consequences.\n\nNo question, you are absolutely right that it is brat behavior and that it is better to learn when he is younger than older!", "I was unaware that the word \"few\" was spelt the same as the word, \"multiple\". You learn something new everyday. Anyway, OP admits they've gotten this patricular child's food preference wrong MULTIPLE times. Multiple and numerous are synonyms. Not one mistake, nor is it a small mistake to the child, obviously. The child is allowed to grow frustrated that OP pretends to care about their food preferences,  but ultimately does little to provide what they promise. Its sad, especially since it seems the child likes their food plain, which is subjectively easier than complex food. By insulting the CHILD and threatening not to provide them with food in the future, OP attempted to bully and manipulate the child over a damn sandwich. The child's mom fed him appropriate food AND scolded OP, which I think says a lot.\n\nETA: Do you think you could maybe stop editing your comment over and over to try and make your argument sound better?", "Well if I had done that when I was 11 I would have been having  sleep for dinner lol.", "NTA. I have an 11 year old boy and a 9 year old girl, and there is NO WAY either of them will scream or make a scene if served the wrong thing. My boy has autism and is a picky eater, but never reacts in that way (I will also not tolerate that kind of behaviour). The kid IS a brat and your sister is enabling the behaviour.", "ESH, the kid is not expressing his frustration at his sandwich tasting gross in an appropriate way for an 11 year old. His yelling at you shows that he doesn\u2019t know how to manage those emotions, and that\u2019s going to be a huge hinderance in his emotional development.\n\nHowever, it sounds like you lost your cool with him too. It\u2019s slightly unclear from the story, but if you told him he was a spoiled brat and that you wouldn\u2019t continue making him sandwiches...I\u2019m guessing you weren\u2019t addressing him calmly at that point. The last thing this kid needs is more adults showing him that it\u2019s okay to lash out when you\u2019re upset. Next time something like this happens, try to take a deep breath, say that you are feeling frustrated/angry/etc. and go talk to your sister about the behavior.

He would refuse to eat it and push it off the plate onto the table or dump it on the floor. He wasn't autistic or had any sensitivities. He was just a brat who was indulged too much by his single mom. He grew out of it and became a normal adult.  I asked him a while ago, and if he had kids, would he let them do the same thing? He just laughed, \"Not a chance,\" lol!", "ESH. You didn\u2019t really make it how he asked if you got mustard all over it. He\u2019s a kid, that was expecting his aunt to make him a sandwich like she said she was. Now everyone else gets to eat and there is nothing for him. Maybe he didn\u2019t verbalize his frustrations appropriately but he was a disappointed kid. \n\nThink how you\u2019d feel if you went to an event and the food they served was covered in something you hate after you told the host you hated that food and she acknowledged your dislike and told you she\u2019d make something you like.

Pulling aside your sister and telling her you suggest she makes Jacks sandwiches form now on because when you do it seems problematic.  Some kids have food issues (although as a parent I think a lot of these food issues are enabled by helicopter parents IMHO) and given making sandwich is your business\u2026 one would think you\u2019d be kind on top of specifics about orders given this type of situation and food allergies?!", "You are definitely not the asshole, you made simple mistake and made those sandwiches for them.

Kid needs to suck it up, he's old enough to make his own damn sandwich.", "One of the mistakes op mentioned in another comment was she accidentally burned the bread a little bit.\n\nThey were accidents and not the same thing each time. This is indeed a reddit moment. Accidentally burning a piece of bread equates to bullying a child.", "How is this manipulating and bullying a child it was a mistake and it was a bit of mustard the kid could eat around. He never specifically said he messed up the kid\u2019s food multiple times just that the kid got mad multiple times."]}
