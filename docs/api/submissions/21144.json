The kids reaction was over the top. You made an honest mistake, but it was a bad one. You can take off things like tomatoes or pickles, or bologna, but mustard permeates and is a very strong flavor. This likely ruined the experience for him while everyone else gets a sandwich. He reacted like an immature kid. But he is a kid. They will have moments like this. Telling him you won\u2019t make him sandwiches again is the right thing to do. Calling him a spoiled brat is over the line. If this is a pattern, it may be different but I\u2019m basing this off what you\u2019ve shared and I wouldn\u2019t call a kid a brat over something like this. That shows you control your emotions as well as a 11 yr old.", "INFO - what has happened multiple times before? His screaming at you, or your inability to keep the sandwiches separate in a bag?", "INFO does Jack have some kind of food related disorder or is this just disliking mustard?", "NTA he is a spoiled brat. It\u2019s mustard on a sandwich. It\u2019s it disappointing for him, sure. He\u2019s plenty old enough to not throw a tantrum over it. He\u2019s not a child. I would tell an 11 yo they\u2019re a spoiled brat too if I was repeatedly treated this way over minor inconveniences. Your sister is setting that kid up for failure", "Not here to give a judgement, but just to give you something to consider, OP. I reacted similarly in my childhood to mishaps with my food, and was degraded and bullied for having extreme reactions to being served things that people KNEW I wouldn't eat. I was 21 before I was finally diagnosed with Autism. Perhaps you're bullying a defenseless autistic kid who sees all food as poison if it isn't deemed one of their safe foods. I never forgave the people who were mean to me about it.", "INFO: do you also cross-contaminate the food you serve to paying customers? And if they complain do you call them brats?", "NTA - it\u2019s crazy there are any YTA judgments on this post", "NTA.  Next time don\u2019t ask. Bring a few various sandwiches and whoever wants them will eat them.  Nothing special for jack anymore.", "YTA and a sincerely doubt Jack cares if you ever make him a sandwich ever again. Also making a mistake with food can have the potential to kill someone so your cavalier attitude is disturbing", "NTA at 11 you are not a baby, he could just cut off the piece with mustard on it or just refuse to eat without throwing a tantrum.", "YTA. If you are unable to regulate your emotions well enough to stop yourself from insulting an 11-year-old boy who is having a strong emotional reaction to a mistake you made, you should excuse yourself from the situation until you regain control of yourself. Be the adult in the situation. If you are not more mature than he is, have the self-respect to fake it.", "NTA. at 11, he should be able to regulate his emotions enough to not act like a 2 year old. You did the kindness of making him something special, unfortunately there was an accident. It happens. He should have calmly asked his mom for something else. If I had acted the way he did, I would have been in so much trouble.", "ESH   I assume you love this child.  You know he is a picky eater.  Your lack of attention to detail and unapologetic attitude is little concerning.  \n\nThe child's reaction seems a bit too dramatic.  He can express his disappointment in a healthy and respectful manner.  You can thank a person for a sandwich while expressing the mustard is an issue.  The little guy needs some coaching and guidance.\n\nAnd the mother needs to be the one providing said coaching and guidance.  She should have a well refined process for correcting him.  He needs to know what he did wrong and what respectful behavior looks like in this situation.  You could certainly help in this.\n\nBoth adults seemed preoccupied with being defensive instead of modeling the calm, thoughtful, and respectful behavior they want from the child.  Is he a brat, or does he have poor role models?", "ESH. His reaction is way over the top but at the same time, you are a grown up reacting to a bratty child. There was no need to say that to him, should have been addressed with mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would have been nice to apologize for making the mistake but you made him a sandwich. You didn\u2019t have to do that. It is a privilege and he should learn that.", "I\u2019m still a picky eater. This isn\u2019t a \u201chuge mistake\u201d it\u2019s a mistake. At 11 you can be disappointed that your sandwich was made wrong but you don\u2019t start screaming at the person about it. He\u2019s not a toddler", "me making mistakes, sometimes it was like the bread burned a bit stuff like that.\n\ni make everything i sell by myself and like a normal human i make mistakes", "no jack doesnt have anytype of a alergie or anything, just a very picky eater", "Agreed. But that does mean the adult calls him a spoiled brat. They both should be better.", "YTA. If you make a mistake you apologise.", "Sometimes, being a really picky eater and over the top melt downs can be an indication of a mental health disorder (ADHD, ASD, etc). His parents may want to look into this if his melt downs are a common thing and he's got \"safe\" foods that they default to.  \n\nNot saying this is the issue.  He might really just be spoiled and not have consequences.", "Then I say ESH\n\nIf he just dislikes mustard, his tantrum was over the top, it was an honest mistake. But, you calling him a brat was also over the line. \n\nYour sister is more of an asshole than Jack because she has apparently taught him that it is acceptable to throw tantrums, 11 is plenty old enough to use his words and not scream.\n\nYou would not have been the asshole if you had not called him names, but told him calmly that his behavior was not nice and you wouldn\u00b4t like to make more sandwiches for him because of it.", "No need to apologise to an 11 year old kid who screamed his face off over a smudge of mustard. He's 11, the days of treating him like a toddler are over and certain standards of behaviour are now expected. He's old enough to cut the offending bread containing mustard off by himself. \n\nMy 4.5 year old doesn't like olives on her pizza. She'll pick them off and resume eating. \n\nEven if the child had a disorder - that's still not behaviour you tolerate or encourage.", "Ummmm. Are you for real? She made him a sandwich as a favor. He neither bought or paid for it. You don\u2019t get angry at someone who takes the time to make you a sandwich for FREE, bc it accidentally got mustard on it.", "i will show it to my sister, thank you for telling me i never knew", "Sorry, what? It's absolutely spoiled brat behaviour. OP made what sounds like a very minor mistake and got *screamed at*. That's completely out of line and 11 years old is more than old enough to be very firmly told that they're behaving like a spoiled brat. Better to learn now when the consequences of such behaviour is relatively minor.", "It might not be the case here, but it also might not hurt for her to do some research. Good luck.", "Could he be on the spectrum?,", "NTA. 11 is old enough to go make himself a PBJ if he doesn\u2019t like what you so kindly went out of your way to make for him. \n\nHe needs to grow up a little bit.", "I genuinely hate the phrase \u201cspoiled brat\u201d. Children only react as well as they are taught to react to upsetting/disappointing experiences. Calling a child names puts the blame on them when in reality they were not given the tools to react in a more appropriate way. It also can really impact their self esteem if they internalize that they are \u201cbad\u201d. \nMy mom called us spoiled brats growing up which is very shitty because she is the one that raised us. It\u2019s not like we grew on trees, we were learning how to act from her. It hurt my feelings more that she ever knew. \n\nAs others pointed out, such a strong reaction could be indicating ASD or other disorders, so that is worth looking into. If your nephew routinely throws a tantrum over everything, that\u2019s a behavioral issue. If it\u2019s only around food, that could indicate some other factors.\nI\u2019m going with either YTA or ESH; not enough info on how your sister raises him and whether there is other stuff going on.", "NTA Kids need to learn some manners.", "YTA do not make fun of the good things it sucks and we remember. I would\u2019ve cussed you out too it\u2019s literally so easy to remember and give 1 SINGLE FIck! To remember to put the picky eaters food seperately and we can tell y\u2019all just don\u2019t give a shit", "I don\u2019t think bagging different sandwiches together really qualifies as a big mistake. I\u2019d be really interested to know how much mustard got on because I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s that much just from being in the same bag with a sandwich that had mustard, it\u2019s not like it was made with the wrong ingredients", "This sort of thing is why I don\u2019t eat sandwiches I don\u2019t make myself.  Mustard\u2026yikes!", "This. Mustard is something that will spoil the entire sandwich if you're not into it. He shouldn't have reacted that way, but he is a kid and kids sometimes blow their top. Also, considering this has apparently happened multiple times \"I won't make you a sandwich anymore\" probably isn't much of a threat because it sounds like he isn't getting ones that he can enjoy as it is.", "Are we now saying, in 2023, that making a mistake with a sandwich equates to bullying? I wonder if my kids will end up in therapy bc I forgot to cut their sandwich into squares when they wanted triangles? You are on the autism spectrum, which maybe this kid it too, but if he is, OP doesn\u2019t know that. If she did, she might have made extra sure his was wrapped by itself.", "It's because people are assuming he must have some sort of disorder, which is causing him to act like this. Which is stupid. His mum's behaviour of just letting her son yell at OP like that and then having a go at *them* when they barely even punished him for his behaviour shows *exactly* why he acts like that. He's a spoilt brat because she lets him act like one. If he continued to act this way despite his mother behaving like a normal parent who punishes their kid for that kind of behaviour, I'd be fully on board with the whole \"he's probably got a problem\" thing, but so far, all I know from this post is he's a child whose mum lets him scream and shout at people when he doesn't get his way, and actually confronts people when they retaliate because *she* can't be bothered to do anything about her own kids behaviour.\n\nIf it turns out he's autistic/has ADHD or some kind of ED that OP just left out, Y T A / E S H, but until then, NTA OP. Your sister is a terrible parent, though.", "A customer would be paying too. What\u2019s that other sub, choosing beggars?", "I mean. I\u2019m sure if a customer threw a tantrum like that over a mistake then they would be in the wrong.", "There\u2019s a difference between complaining and screaming at someone. If I scream at someone because a little mustard got on my sandwich that I paid for, I am still an AH.", "Where did OP insult him? They told Jack that if Jack screamed at them again they would stop making him free sandwiches. That's not an insult, it's just a reasonable rule to make.", "I'm saying that repeatedly (per OPs admittance that this has happened numerous times before) being obtuse about the child's food preferences to the point of asking them what they want and still doing NOTHING to accommodate the child is fucked. As an adult, how often are you pressured/forced to eat things you dislike?... Never, because you buy what you like. Kids don't have that luxury, so we as adults should accommodate their likes and dislikes the same way we accommodate ourselves. You have your needs met and they deserve their's met too.", "First of all, making mistakes with food can be deadly and OP has no way of knowing if customers are picky or allergic. If sandwiches are wrapped so badly that they routinely get condiments on each other, that\u2019s a problem OP really needs to address.\n\nAnd customers who throw tantrums are absolutely in the wrong but they\u2019re also an unavoidable part of any service industry. A lot of times, you have to suck it up and make an asshole customer a new sandwich if you want to have a successful business.", "They should apologize for a free sandwich? To a kid to screamed at them? Nope.", "Numerous and few are different descriptors. Do you know how many times I\u2019ve accidentally burnt my kid\u2019s grilled cheese? She did plenty to accommodate, and then made a mistake. No one pressured him to eat it. Where did you read that? His mom made him something else. He absolutely has a choice. Raising your kids the way you are talking about is going to give them \u201ccenter of the universe\u201d syndrome.", "I fully agree with you that it was spoiled brat behavior, but I think that getting mad and calling the kid names doesn\u00b4t model good behavior for him either.\n\nIf he is throwing tantrums like this at 11 (assuming he is neurotypical) then he has not been taught to use his words instead of scream. I think it is safe to assume that sister has always just given in when he screams, rather than nipping the tantrum in the bud and teaching him to use his words (of course when he was old enough to understand, which was way before age 11).\n\nSo to me, if uncle says calmly and firmly that it isn\u00b4t nice behavior and the consequence is no more sandwiches, that is enough and he doesn\u00b4t need to add on the brat part. Uncle isn\u00b4t so much the disciplinarian but uncle can definitely say that your actions have consequences.\n\nNo question, you are absolutely right that it is brat behavior and that it is better to learn when he is younger than older!", "I was unaware that the word \"few\" was spelt the same as the word, \"multiple\". You learn something new everyday. Anyway, OP admits they've gotten this patricular child's food preference wrong MULTIPLE times. Multiple and numerous are synonyms. Not one mistake, nor is it a small mistake to the child, obviously. The child is allowed to grow frustrated that OP pretends to care about their food preferences,  but ultimately does little to provide what they promise. Its sad, especially since it seems the child likes their food plain, which is subjectively easier than complex food. By insulting the CHILD and threatening not to provide them with food in the future, OP attempted to bully and manipulate the child over a damn sandwich. The child's mom fed him appropriate food AND scolded OP, which I think says a lot.\n\nETA: Do you think you could maybe stop editing your comment over and over to try and make your argument sound better?"]}
