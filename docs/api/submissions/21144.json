The kids reaction was over the top. You made an honest mistake, but it was a bad one. You can take off things like tomatoes or pickles, or bologna, but mustard permeates and is a very strong flavor. This likely ruined the experience for him while everyone else gets a sandwich. He reacted like an immature kid. But he is a kid. They will have moments like this. Telling him you won\u2019t make him sandwiches again is the right thing to do. Calling him a spoiled brat is over the line. If this is a pattern, it may be different but I\u2019m basing this off what you\u2019ve shared and I wouldn\u2019t call a kid a brat over something like this. That shows you control your emotions as well as a 11 yr old.", "INFO - what has happened multiple times before? His screaming at you, or your inability to keep the sandwiches separate in a bag?", "INFO does Jack have some kind of food related disorder or is this just disliking mustard?", "NTA he is a spoiled brat. It\u2019s mustard on a sandwich. It\u2019s it disappointing for him, sure. He\u2019s plenty old enough to not throw a tantrum over it. He\u2019s not a child. I would tell an 11 yo they\u2019re a spoiled brat too if I was repeatedly treated this way over minor inconveniences. Your sister is setting that kid up for failure", "Not here to give a judgement, but just to give you something to consider, OP. I reacted similarly in my childhood to mishaps with my food, and was degraded and bullied for having extreme reactions to being served things that people KNEW I wouldn't eat. I was 21 before I was finally diagnosed with Autism. Perhaps you're bullying a defenseless autistic kid who sees all food as poison if it isn't deemed one of their safe foods. I never forgave the people who were mean to me about it.", "INFO: do you also cross-contaminate the food you serve to paying customers? And if they complain do you call them brats?", "NTA - it\u2019s crazy there are any YTA judgments on this post", "NTA.  Next time don\u2019t ask. Bring a few various sandwiches and whoever wants them will eat them.  Nothing special for jack anymore.", "YTA and a sincerely doubt Jack cares if you ever make him a sandwich ever again. Also making a mistake with food can have the potential to kill someone so your cavalier attitude is disturbing", "NTA at 11 you are not a baby, he could just cut off the piece with mustard on it or just refuse to eat without throwing a tantrum.", "YTA. If you are unable to regulate your emotions well enough to stop yourself from insulting an 11-year-old boy who is having a strong emotional reaction to a mistake you made, you should excuse yourself from the situation until you regain control of yourself. Be the adult in the situation. If you are not more mature than he is, have the self-respect to fake it.", "NTA. at 11, he should be able to regulate his emotions enough to not act like a 2 year old. You did the kindness of making him something special, unfortunately there was an accident. It happens. He should have calmly asked his mom for something else. If I had acted the way he did, I would have been in so much trouble.", "ESH   I assume you love this child.  You know he is a picky eater.  Your lack of attention to detail and unapologetic attitude is little concerning.  \n\nThe child's reaction seems a bit too dramatic.  He can express his disappointment in a healthy and respectful manner.  You can thank a person for a sandwich while expressing the mustard is an issue.  The little guy needs some coaching and guidance.\n\nAnd the mother needs to be the one providing said coaching and guidance.  She should have a well refined process for correcting him.  He needs to know what he did wrong and what respectful behavior looks like in this situation.  You could certainly help in this.\n\nBoth adults seemed preoccupied with being defensive instead of modeling the calm, thoughtful, and respectful behavior they want from the child.  Is he a brat, or does he have poor role models?", "ESH. His reaction is way over the top but at the same time, you are a grown up reacting to a bratty child. There was no need to say that to him, should have been addressed with mom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It would have been nice to apologize for making the mistake but you made him a sandwich. You didn\u2019t have to do that. It is a privilege and he should learn that.", "I\u2019m still a picky eater. This isn\u2019t a \u201chuge mistake\u201d it\u2019s a mistake. At 11 you can be disappointed that your sandwich was made wrong but you don\u2019t start screaming at the person about it. He\u2019s not a toddler", "me making mistakes, sometimes it was like the bread burned a bit stuff like that.\n\ni make everything i sell by myself and like a normal human i make mistakes", "no jack doesnt have anytype of a alergie or anything, just a very picky eater", "Agreed. But that does mean the adult calls him a spoiled brat. They both should be better.", "YTA. If you make a mistake you apologise.", "Sometimes, being a really picky eater and over the top melt downs can be an indication of a mental health disorder (ADHD, ASD, etc). His parents may want to look into this if his melt downs are a common thing and he's got \"safe\" foods that they default to.  \n\nNot saying this is the issue.  He might really just be spoiled and not have consequences.", "Then I say ESH\n\nIf he just dislikes mustard, his tantrum was over the top, it was an honest mistake. But, you calling him a brat was also over the line. \n\nYour sister is more of an asshole than Jack because she has apparently taught him that it is acceptable to throw tantrums, 11 is plenty old enough to use his words and not scream.\n\nYou would not have been the asshole if you had not called him names, but told him calmly that his behavior was not nice and you wouldn\u00b4t like to make more sandwiches for him because of it.", "No need to apologise to an 11 year old kid who screamed his face off over a smudge of mustard. He's 11, the days of treating him like a toddler are over and certain standards of behaviour are now expected. He's old enough to cut the offending bread containing mustard off by himself. \n\nMy 4.5 year old doesn't like olives on her pizza. She'll pick them off and resume eating. \n\nEven if the child had a disorder - that's still not behaviour you tolerate or encourage.", "Ummmm. Are you for real? She made him a sandwich as a favor. He neither bought or paid for it. You don\u2019t get angry at someone who takes the time to make you a sandwich for FREE, bc it accidentally got mustard on it.", "i will show it to my sister, thank you for telling me i never knew", "Sorry, what? It's absolutely spoiled brat behaviour. OP made what sounds like a very minor mistake and got *screamed at*. That's completely out of line and 11 years old is more than old enough to be very firmly told that they're behaving like a spoiled brat. Better to learn now when the consequences of such behaviour is relatively minor.", "It might not be the case here, but it also might not hurt for her to do some research. Good luck."]}
