We can\u2019t go in between classes, during the first five minutes of class, during the last 5 minutes of class, or when the teacher is in the middle of a lesson. So pretty much, never. Some teachers aren\u2019t as strict with these rules, but some are. One day when I was on my period and really needed to change my pad, I went to the bathroom in between classes so that I\u2019d have my backpack with me and be able to get a new pad from it. When I was walking in, a male teacher who I didn\u2019t even know was following me and yelling \u201cHey, you can\u2019t go to the bathroom!\u201d I kept walking and he said \u201cI know you can here me! You can\u2019t go to the bathroom!\u201d I still kept walking. As I\u2019m inside the stall he\u2019s standing right outside of it still yelling at me and telling me to come out. Once I was done and came out he was yelling right in my face and telling me I can\u2019t go to the bathroom in between classes, but that he\u2019d let me off with a warning.

Also your male teacher literally came into the girls room and yelled at you while you were inside the stall? This is highly inappropriate and can be seen as sexual harrasment. You should report him to the school board", "NTA\n\nWhat stupid administrator made a rule against using the bathroom between classes though?  When else do they expect you to go?  \n\nSeriously, next time, look at the jerk and say, \u201cI need to change my tampon. Do you need to see it to approve it?\u201d  Or some other snappy comeback.  Let the teacher turn red about it.  Cause you know they will.", "The public school in my town came up with almost identical rules a few years ago. It caused a lot of problems, tons of kids were getting UTI\u2019s from holding it to long, kidney infections because they weren\u2019t drinking enough water so they wouldn\u2019t have to go, and girls were constantly bleeding through there clothes or would have to fake illnesses to go to the nurse to use the bathroom so their could change pads and tampons. This was an actual medical issue. A group of kids went to a school board meeting and a local pediatrician also attended and spoke about how this was a danger to the children\u2019s health and the up tick in UTIs ad kidney infections. The school board members claimed to not even be aware of the rules, as they were not in the policy book and it was immediately abolished.  I highly suggest talking to your parents, friends, and event pediatrician about this issue. This is a dangerous policy they have in place. Get some support, write some letters or go directly to a school board meeting. Also, request the policy in writing so that you can have it when you go.", "NTA. My daughter is a teenager and I've always told her \"If a teacher won't let you go...just go. I'll deal with the school\".", "NTA! I'm a high school teacher, and for the life of me, I can't figure out what in the hell is wrong with your school for not letting you go to the bathroom between classes. That's messed up!", "Nta\n Holy f@ck, what a nightmare", "NTA...access to the toilet is a basic human need. They can make all the rules they want, but it won't change people's needs. Do what you need to do and hope others do the same.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you are facing a difficult situation at your high school. The bathroom restrictions and the inappropriate behavior of the male teacher are concerning. Your personal health and dignity should never be compromised in any setting, especially not in a school environment.\n\nI suggest speaking with the school administration about this incident and any others you've witnessed. They should be made aware of the inappropriate behavior and the impact it's having on students. You may also want to consider reaching out to a trusted teacher or counselor for support.\n\nRemember that you have a right to access the bathroom when you need to, regardless of school rules. You also have a right to be treated with respect and dignity by all staff members. Don't be afraid to advocate for yourself and others who may be experiencing similar issues.", "NTA. At all. I\u2019m impressed that at a young age you can stay so calm and handle your business.\n\nI come from a family of people with medically confirmed small bladders and bladder problems. I\u2019m 37 now but as a kid and teen in school too it was so stressful to navigate all the rules and I didn\u2019t have your level of confidence.\n\nSome people just don\u2019t get bathroom stuff. I always wonder if they have magical bodies with no problems ever and can\u2019t empathize or if they\u2019re just dicks. Probably both.\n\nI once got a bloody nose in the middle of class (random) and the teacher started screaming at me to stay in my desk and the other students were screaming at me (for some reason angrily) to leave and I just froze and couldn\u2019t figure out what to do.\n\nTake care of your body really well is the best advice I could give to the young and I don\u2019t mean in a stay hot and fit forever way, I mean trust your body\u2019s cues and follow them and take care of yourself and other people who don\u2019t like that can fuck off.", "NTA, and you need to escalate this.

The teacher was being a dick, clearly", "Sounds like AH teachers on a huge powertrip.\nMight be a good idea to get the parental class contact (?) to start making some noise with the principal.\nHere in Norway behaviour like that might get the teacher fired.\nEspecially if he actually followed you into the girls bathroom.\nPretty sure there's strict rules about that in other countries too.\nNTA for sure.", "NTA - I remember these stupid bathroom rules as if you can schedule your bodily functions. I\u2019d report the teacher for harassment, explain the situation if you can. You shouldn\u2019t have a man scream in your face for using a bathroom, this is totally inappropriate regardless of whatever arbitrary rules your school has. A male teacher should have the common sense and decency to understand the embarrassment this could cause a young girl, he should have been discreet and let you use the bathroom without hassle.", "NTA you need to report him immediately in no way was it okay for him to follow you into the girls restroom and then continue to harass you through the stall doors", "No of course you aren\u2019t TA here. I\u2019m so sorry you have to go to school in this kind of environment. Hold steady and keep doing what you need to do. If you get sent to the dean\u2019s office for it or get in some kind of other trouble, you can make all of them look bad by explaining your period situation. Teachers and admin could get in a lot of trouble from preventing you from using the bathroom when you need it.", "NTA.

I've instructed my daughter to do just as you did and ignore any adult trying to control her bathroom needs.", "NTA. Tell your parents what happened. A  teacher has no right to stand outside a bathroom stall while a student is it.", "Definitely NTA. I would turn him in for being in the girl's restroom! In a high school! That's creepy AF. And I would start a petition to change the bathroom rules because that ridiculous. How can they keep you from going to the restroom on your free time? No. F!@k that. If parents complain, the school usually makes proper changes. And if your local paper found out or somehow got the list with this rule, I'm sure that would be an interesting article. Just saying...", "NTA you all should organize a strike or a class action lawsuit or something. Unbelievable.", "Wait, A male teacher came into the females bathroom?  There would be police involved if that happened at any of the High Schools local to me.  NTA Report that SOB.", "NTA- I'm impressed how you handled the situation.", "NTA. \n\nI do think it\u2019s ridiculous. I remember having a male gym teacher tell a middle schooler that her period cannot be longer than seven days and that she\u2019s lying as to why she can\u2019t go swimming on pool day. Does this gym teacher have the hormones of a sixth grader thats why he knows how long a developing females body works?", "NTA. \n\nI made it a point to let my pad bleed on a seat when a hs teacher didn't let me go to the bathroom. She never had another power trip with me and none of the others did either lol Plus I got to go home early to change and shower \ud83e\udd23\n\nI would speak to someone about him following you to the bathroom screaming though. That's a bit concerning honestly. And by a bit I mean a lot.", "NTA\n\nTalk about a policy issue at your school. In your own words, yes the rule is stupid. Making kids \"hold it in\" creates a distraction to the learning environment to those who really got to go.\n\nIs there parent outrage over this issue?", "NTA Get a group of girls in your school to stage a protest about it and invite local newspapers to cover it - that should cause enough bad publicity that they'll reconsider the policy fairly quickly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
