The annoying thing is I'm in charge of watching Marcus and Amalia, and Marcus and Amalia don't get along.\n\nMarcus and his friends like to mess around with Amalia by hiding her phone and other stupid kid shit. I've told her multiple time to just ignore it and not give a reaction but she does the exact opposite. She screams and cries and feeds into their pranks and gives them attention.\n\nSo Marcus had his friend Billy over and they were hanging out in their room. Amalia was taking a nap in her room. Billy and Marcus apparently snuck into her room, and Billy brought his tarantula over from his house and put in on her while she was sleeping.\n\nSo Amalia had a huge fear of spiders. Like even for tiny spiders. So imagine her reaction when she saw a giant ass spider, and yeah it was understandable at first.\n\nSo she screams and cries and does her thing, but she's bawling and screaming at Billy to gtfo and at this point I hear the ruckus and I find out what's going on. I tell Billy and Marcus to just do their thing and leave her alone, and they just go to Marcus's room.\n\nAmalia keeps crying and asking why I didn't make Billy leave or why I didn't get mad at the both of them. I told her again if she reacts to it, they're gonna keep doing it. She cried more and said she hated them and that \"I was taking his side\". I told her to stfu because I wasn't, I'm just fucking studying for midterms and don't want to deal with this drama she's now creating over something so stupid. I get being mad a the moment, but she wasn't just moving on.\n\nShe cried more and said couldn't deal with this anymore, and I told her too bad and to get over it but that's life she's gonna have to keep continue doing that as she gets older.\n\nShe's now not talking to me, and it's been four days. I kinda feel like I went too far, but idk I think she needed to hear that. AITA?\n\nUpdate: Okay I accept my verdict. But just putting this out there, some of y'all grown ass men dming me and saying I'm going to fail in life or calling me a heartless cunt is weird asf. Literally you're creepy and don't know me or my family, go away. For people actually concerned this isn't targeted towards you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate 2: To everyone saying tell my parents, click on my profile and read all my comments. Not to sound rude, but I'm tired of explaining why again and again.

You both are older than her and should know better. Marcus is intentionally bullying her and you the ADULT are not just allowing it but encouraging it. Not sure what your issues are with your little sister but truly you are a horrible sister to her", "Wow YTA. Like majorly. Why are you blaming her for their cruelty? I have an insane fear of spiders and I could never forgive someone for doing something that horrible, it would scar me.\n\n Telling her to get over bullying is not the right call. Maybe it\u2019s true that if she reacts to it their going to keep doing it. Or maybe it they had some semblance of consequences to them being dicks they would stop. Don\u2019t blame the victim.", "You told an 11 y/o child with arachnophobia  to just get over a tarantula being put on her by her elder step brother and his buddy, neither of which shoulda been in her room while she was sleeping in the first place?\n\nYeah, YTA. And you probably shouldn't be left in charge if this is what it looks like.", "YTA. You should not be watching your younger  siblings. Your brother is bullying your little sister and you ignore his unacceptable behavior. He should not be in her room without her permission and his friend should have sent home after this \u201cprank.\u201d\n\nYou did take his side because there were no consequences for his actions. I wouldn\u2019t speak to you either if I were in her shoes.", "YTA. Your sister has a huge fear of spiders and reacted as she should when confronted with that fear. You have zero empathy for your sister and honestly? You shouldn't even be left in charge anymore, if you're going to act like that. \"JuSt IgNoRe ThEm\" is the same as saying \"boys will be boys\". It excuses horrible and bullying behavior. And it is bullying, but she's not getting it just from Marcus and his friends. You are something of a bully as well and she's right that you're taking his side. You need to grow up, step up, and protect your sister. Tell your parents what's going on. And I mean everything, not just the spider incident.", "YTA.  Your stepbrother is a little shit, and you are enabling his bullying.  Keep him away from your half-sister, and put some consequences on him if he doesn't, including forbidding his delinquent friends entry to your home.  If he doesn't learn how to act like a human being now, he's going to be a disaster for everyone very soon.", "YTA full stop. You're telling her that your own peace and quiet is more important than her feeling safe in her own damn room and that your stepbrother has every right to torture and abuse her and she should effectively 'shut the hell up and take it'. When an abuser is ignored, they don't just give up, shrug, and walk away. The abuse escalates from emotional and mental attacks to physical. Today, it was a live tarantula. Tomorrow, he's pinning her down and cutting all her hair off or hitting her. \n\n    Tell your damn parents about the shit he constantly pulls with her and put a stop to a pattern of sociopathic behaviors before he gets a further developed sense of entitlement that he can hurt whomever he wants whenever he wants. Also, bear in mind that soon he's going to possibly be much bigger and stronger than you, and then you'll be a fresh new torture target all over again.\n\n\nEdit: wall of text into paragraphs", "A prank would be a fake spider.

At this point they're not just bullying her but terrorizing the poor girl. You did nothing but wrongfully scold the kid who was terrified and upset. If nothing is done, the bullying will keep happening for years and eventually cause problems for the kid. (If you don't believe the words I typed, just take a look at me. I hate and am afraid of interacting with people in person because of bullying. I also have trust issues because of bullying.)\n\nAlso, what the fuck are the parents doing about the problem? They need to do more since nothing is being done about the bullying.", "Why are you in charge of this?? Where are your parents and what are they doing about this??", "YTA  \nBut this is a bad situation for you to be in. You're responsible for your half sister and your step brother and his friends? That's a lot for a teenager. It sounds like your parents wouldn't back you up even if you did make a decision so there's probably little you can do to stop this.  \nBut at least be sympathetic to your sister. Tell her they're jerks, you're sorry they do those things to her. She didn't create the drama, the boys are just bullies, and even if there's nothing you can do about it you can at least be on her side.", "ESH except Amalia. The boys are mean-spirited bullies pulling hateful pranks, I sympathize with your stress over exams, but you did a classic case of blaming the victim here and that just rewarded the boys for their nastiness.

But one thing to keep in mind, how an 11-year old handles things like this is very different from how an 18-tear old does.

How is it the victim's job to control the bully by being stoic and letting them keep bullying? That has never worked anyway and is a wildly unfair expectation from anyone let alone an 11 year old! You should have kicked Billy out and he should never be allowed back over and Marcus should be facing some kind of real consequence every time he bullies this young child. Not that this is totally your job though, where the hell are your parents in all of this?", "this kind of dismissive attitude is exactly why me and my older sister don\u2019t speak anymore, and our age difference is only a year less than yours. \n\nIf you refuse to be there for your little sister, like a big sister should be, then once she\u2019s able to fend for herself she will distance herself. its 4 days now but it could turn into 4 years down the line. \n\nlike others said, she\u2019s 4 years younger than him. she can\u2019t just brush it off and ignore the fact that every person older than her in her home is enabling this behaviour. additionally, your brother is older now than he was when he bullied you. he might not let off as easily as he did for you bc i\u2019m sure he would see now that any kind of non-reaction is just a mask for her \u2014 he could potentially just continue to push and push and push her buttons until she reacts.\n\nanyways obv YTA but on a serious note and i wanna stress this, i wish someone had told my sister to be there and stick up for me more when i was younger because it genuinely does suck being an adult and having a crappy relationship with your only big sister. but at a certain point, the relationship is irreparably damaged and any kind of cordial/acquaintance-type of connection isn\u2019t worth the painful memories of consistently being brushed off or dismissed. as if her feelings aren\u2019t valid, real, and worthy of immediate action. i really hope this gets through to you because a day will come that you\u2019ll regret this", "YTA. I understand you are only 18 but you are the adult here. The situation is escalating because you are letting it happen. It is your responsibility to kick his friends out if they are behaving badly. If you are not mature enough to look after your siblings then you and your family need to make other arrangements. Perhaps you need a baby sitter for all of you.", "Of course YTA this is some serious boys will be boys crap and its disgusting, they are 14 they know damn well what they're doing and it's sick they get pleasure out of torturing her, where are your parents?", "YTA.  You're a terrible big sister who is allowing your little sister to be ruthlessly bullied while you accuse HER of being the problem.", "I say this as a woman in my 30\u2019s, if someone put any kind of spider, much less a tarantula on me while I was sleeping I would be TRAUMATIZED.\n\nYour little sister can\u2019t even feel safe to sleep in her home now and all you can say is get over it? That she\u2019s being too dramatic?\n\nI get that you don\u2019t want to watch your sibs but your utter lack of engagement and empathy makes YTA big time. \n\nYour sister needs a voice and an ally over repetitive mean-spirited bullying and you\u2019re too self-absorbed to do anything but brush her off.", "ESH except for your sister.\n\nYou should be sticking up for her and aren\u2019t so you suck.\n\nMarcus sucks for obvious reason.\n\nYour parents suck for forcing you to babysit when studying should be your job and it appears your stepdad is just off doing his own thing instead of watching the younger kids.", "DUDE! Stop fucking defending yourself in the comments. Your brother is an asshole bully and you're a bully by proxy by victim blaming and shaming your sister instead of talking to your brother.

Amalia did not create drama, Marcus and his friend did. What you consider \"something so stupid\" was very likely a horrible, traumatizing event for her.

Maybe *you're* the type of person who can turn your shoulder when someone attacks you, but your sister is obviously not that kind of person. She was HURT.

The annoying thing is I'm in charge of watching Marcus and Amalia, and Marcus and Amalia don't get along.\n\nMarcus and his friends like to mess around with Amalia by hiding her phone and other stupid kid shit. I've told her multiple time to just ignore it and not give a reaction but she does the exact opposite. She screams and cries and feeds into their pranks and gives them attention.\n\nSo Marcus had his friend Billy over and they were hanging out in their room. Amalia was taking a nap in her room. Billy and Marcus apparently snuck into her room, and Billy brought his tarantula over from his house and put in on her while she was sleeping.\n\nSo Amalia had a huge fear of spiders. Like even for tiny spiders. So imagine her reaction when she saw a giant ass spider, and yeah it was understandable at first.\n\nSo she screams and cries and does her thing, but she's bawling and screaming at Billy to gtfo and at this point I hear the ruckus and I find out what's going on. I tell Billy and Marcus to just do their thing and leave her alone, and they just go to Marcus's room.\n\nAmalia keeps crying and asking why I didn't make Billy leave or why I didn't get mad at the both of them. I told her again if she reacts to it, they're gonna keep doing it. She cried more and said she hated them and that \"I was taking his side\". I told her to stfu because I wasn't, I'm just fucking studying for midterms and don't want to deal with this drama she's now creating over something so stupid. I get being mad a the moment, but she wasn't just moving on.\n\nShe cried more and said couldn't deal with this anymore, and I told her too bad and to get over it but that's life she's gonna have to keep continue doing that as she gets older.\n\nShe's now not talking to me, and it's been four days. I kinda feel like I went too far, but idk I think she needed to hear that. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So many things could have gone wrong, she could have gotten hurt and that pet might have died. \n\nWhat if something worse happens? Will you be okay with that then?
