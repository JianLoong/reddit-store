Giant hugs to you. It\u2019s taken years but I\u2019ve found a balance and my husband found a way to say no. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be equal. Not at all.   This is about you, the baby, your toddler, and your husband.  If your mother is a \u201chelper\u201d then she can come. If MIL is not, then she stays home.

You\u2019re the one giving birth and carrying the baby, it\u2019s literally YOUR medical procedure, all that matters is who you are comfortable with. Have him read the Lemon Clot Essay, it helped my husband a lot to realize you really don\u2019t want anyone there if it will make you uncomfortable at all. You\u2019ll be bleeding, possibly tits always out if you\u2019re breastfeeding, and in diapers and your comfort and bonding with baby comes first. NTA", "NTA. Of course it should be equal in a marriage, but unless your husband is the one that is breastfeeding, staying up with the baby, and recovering from birth, this is the time when your needs take precedence.

Maybe set some ground rules and actually enforce them strictly? Consequences include you going to stay with your parents for a bit, or something along those lines?\n\nAlso your husband is not doing \"equal equal.\" He's not going through pregnancy, labor, and delivery, so he owes you. He's the one falling short.\n\nLooks like MIL just wants to meet baby first. Please make it clear that all \"guests\" are coming to help, not just hold the baby all day long. If you have a c section,  you'll need help in the middle of the night during those first few days so guests will have to endure sleep deprivation and such. They will be doing cooking, cleaning, laundry, etc. They will be watching the kids when you need to nap. They will only hold the baby when you allow it.

DH needs a new spine though, but if he\u2019s not stepping up I\u2019m afraid you have to. \n\nIf she\u2019s more bother than help, list down the reasons and inform your husband because he\u2019s apparently too blind to see it so be very specific.", "NTA, but you're going to get a lot of shit here, because this sub is full of teenagers with no actual clue about pregnancy, marriage, or annoying ILs.", "Straightaway NTA. \n\nIn-laws are a handful at the best of times.", ">she\u2019s such an immature bitch throwing a pity party and my husband\u2019s such a sissy pussy \n\nOkay you had me up until this part. WOW. That's some anger you need to work on before the baby gets here.\n\nThe child is also your husband's child. He has the right to have his mother involved in his child's life. Maybe you should just reduce the time each parent visits so that you are less overwhelmed. I get it. My mother was much more helpful when my son was born than my mother-in-law... but my mother-in-law is my child's grandmother, too. You are a part of a family now.

Why are you having kids with a man you do not respect and would describe that way to other people? Why do you have this expectation that families will only visit every other year?
