Honestly, I was reading through this going: \"Dude, why is it on her to refill the soap you use...\" and then I reached the end of your post and... holy hamburgers, batman!.\n\nTo summarize for those in the back of the room:\n\n* **Situation:** Wife doesn't want OP tracking dirt through the house when coming in from the garage or the yard (*fair... I wouldn't want to clean up that mess either*)\n* **Solution:** OP enters through the garage when dirty and uses the bathroom that is right there to clean up (*good solution!*)\n* **Problem:** There's never any soap there to clean up with (*Ooops, now that's a problem but easily fixable*)\n* **Attempt to Solve #1:** OP tries to keep the soap dispenser full by taking ownership of the soap issue and refilling it. (*Seems fair, after all... if he's the primary person using that bathroom it would make sense for him to \"own\" refilling the soap.*)\n* **Failure #1:** Wife refuses to let OP keep refill soap in the bathroom, stores the soap refills elsewhere, won't tell OP where she is storing it AND gets mad at OP when he tries to find it... you know, to solve the problem. (*Ok, now it's getting a little weird.*)\n* **Attempt to Solve #2:** OP buys a separate soap refill so he can refill as needed. (*A little extreme, but still a workable solution.*)\n* **Failure #2:** Wife finds and hides the soap refill that OP bought (*Um, WTF?*)\n* **Attempt to Solve #3:** OP buys some bars of soap to use in just that bathroom (*Ok, another valid solution.*)\n* **Failure #3:** Wife throws out the bars of soap because she finds bar soap gross. (*Seriously, WTFing here.*)\n* **Attempt to Solve #4:** OP asks wife to keep the soap in the bathroom full (*I mean, what else can you do at this point if she is actively preventing you from taking care of it yourself?*)\n* **Failure #4:** Wife refuses (*facepalm*)\n* **Attempt to Solve #5:** OP buys new, pre-filled soap dispensers and swaps them out whenever the old soap dispenser runs out (*Rather wasteful, but at this point what else can you do?*)\n* **Failure #5:** Wife calls OP an AH for being wasteful and keeps digging through the trash to recover the empty soap dispensers (*dude, how many empty soap dispensers do y'all have at this point?*)\n\nIn this case, no... you're very much **NTA**. And you have a lot more patience than I do... I would have lasted about to where she was *throwing out the bars of soap* (and she complains about waste?!?) instead of lettign you use them to wash up. Your wife, on the other hand, is TA and it sounds like she has some bigger control issues. Hint: It's probably not just about the soap!", "NTA\n\nWhat wrong with her? Why is she hiding soap and picking fights over it?\n\nDo you guys need marriage counseling, or does she need her own therapist?\n\nThis makes no sense.", "NTA this soap opera is borderline insane.", "NTA. What does she want.  From your post it seems like you tried a lot of reasonable solutions.  Good luck.", "NTA - You have tried several reasonable ways to address the issue and she sabotages each one. If throwing them away is the only way to get her to refill the container, so be it.\n\nThat being said, y\u2019all really need to talk this out and figure out what exactly is the problem. This has got to be deeper than just not wanting to refill the container in that bathroom.", "NTA.\n\nMy gut reaction two sentences in was *'Why don't you just refill the soap yourself'* but after reading the entire story your wife is unreasonable.", "NTA, you asked where the refill are kept and she stole them? I mean the actual F is going on with her?! That's some insanity! Hopefully she won't keep doing it for other stuff!", "\u201cI bought my own gallon of soap and she found and hid it wherever she hides that shit\u201d is why I read this sub. Thank you.\n\nNTA, by the way.", "NTA.  She can either refill them. Or give you an extra for that bathroom.

You\u2019re wife sounds controlling AF, she\u2019s got some very weird issues about it and seems to be picking fights.

Inquisitive minds want to know!!!", "NTA - whatever is wrong with your wife isn't insignificant.  who tf throws away bars of soap because they're gross? and then taking and hiding the liquid soap you bought so you could replace it yourself?  baffling behavior that is nonetheless bat shit.", "NTA.

If your wife behaves this way only about the soap issue, then this is concerning and if you sit down and have a serious conversation then maybe it could be resolved? If she behaves this way about other issues in your relationship, then you both need counseling to get to the bottom of this. Best of luck.", "NTA she needs to leave a refill bottle in that bathroom", "Dude. NTA, but your wife seriously needs to seek therapy. She's being ridiculously controlling about freaking soap. I'm not a therapist, but even I can see your wife's actions are not normal or healthy.", "NTA - Why on earth is she holding the liquid soap hostage from you?", "NTA. She's not giving you a reasonable solution.  If you were just too lazy to change it yourself, then you'd be in the wrong. Seems like your wife just wants complete control of her soap empire.", "NTA sounds like she's better off living alone, she can't handle living with another person", "This is bizarre. NTA. Unsure if your wife is fucking with you or not, but it\u2019s not hard to just leave soap in the bathroom!", "NTA. And you have the patience of a saint. With all due respect she sounds like a fucking nightmare. Is she your mom to tell you how to wash yourself? Like how are you not allowed to have any other kind of soap, or your own liquid soap or any kind of say in that matter? Stand up for yourself.", "NTA, What exactky are you supposed to do? It shouldnt be this hard to do something in your own damn house. My step mom wouldnt let anyone clean anything, their own clothes, the dishes. I was only allowed one pump of soap to wash my hands with and would be yelled at if my dsd wssnt home and she thought the soap went too fast. Even if i abided by her rules, if it wemt too fast, shed complain that i used too much soap when i wash my hands, and that it was obvious i was using too much, if i was using the amount she specified then the soap would be lasting longer. Well apparently not, but she did not care and it was always my fault because she was \"always\" right. \n\nAnyway, if your wife chooses to keep ignoring you, she needs therapy. She may also be used to living this way and getting her way, so she is buckling down any way she knows how. Fact is, its your home and your bathroom too. You should be partners, and should be able to discuss hard topics. Yet you're wife is abusing you, over soap. And yes it is abuse. You are under a constant pressure from your wife, day in and day out. She CAN and should be trying to manage her symptoms, whether from OCD or something else. She should not ever allow herself to knowingly cause you stress, just so she can be right and in charge of certain things. Its super disrespectful and belittling to you, that you cant even \"help\" refill soap in your own house. I just assume from this that you also cant clean \"right\" enough for her, or maybe even fold laundry right. \n\nI lived a life under a woman like that, and it was insufferable as a growing child. I wanted to learn, and got thrown out into the deep end because even when i begged her to show me her way of doing things, i got \"No were not doing that, youd just do it wrong anyway.\" \n\nSo, i hope that if you want to have kids in the future, you will especially try to figure out whats going on with her first. Or find someone else all together for that if its what you want. \n\nOnly your wife really can decide to stop being so closed off, you may need to consider what youll do if she just straight up doesnt want to change. And if you have to leave in order to preserve ypur own mental health (or split the house, whatever works.) Maybe it could show her how much her actions/prefernces are altering someone elses life for the worse. Good luck, either way.", "NTA", "Definitely NTA and OMG she's soooo annoying!", "NTA. \n\nBut maybe get non-refillable/disposable pump soaps?
