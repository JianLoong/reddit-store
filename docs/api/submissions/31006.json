My mom and her dad got married when I was 12 and they\u2019re great parents to us both however I just don\u2019t  like who she is as a person. I\u2019m not rude to her when I see her; I\u2019m civil, I ask how she is and all the regular questions you\u2019d ask when seeing someone after a while I just choose not to associate with her if I don\u2019t have to. \n\nTwo years ago I found out I was pregnant despite doctors saying my whole life it wouldn\u2019t be possible, during that time Amy and I did get a bit closer. It was small things like she would offer advice on baby items and brands, I appreciate this and took her advice because despite my feelings towards her I hadn\u2019t ever been able to fault her as a mom. She\u2019s a great mom to her kids and her advice did mean a lot and it helped. Amy even asked if she could make a cake for a gender reveal, I wanted to have her feel included as we had started to get close so I accepted. \n\nI lost my baby a few weeks after the party and that\u2019s when Amy and I began to distance again. She said incredibly hurtful things that I haven\u2019t been able to forgive. \n\nI found out I\u2019m expecting again. When I told my family she acted excited and started planning a gender reveal in front of me. I told her I don\u2019t want one. I don\u2019t care about the gender I just want them to be healthy. Our whole family agreed not to do a party and they understood, I was grateful. \n\nLast week I went to a family meal at our parents house as my due date is soon and we don\u2019t know when we can all be together again. When I got there I found out Amy had completely ignored me and decided SHE was having a gender reveal. Obviously I was pissed. \n\nAfter finding out that everyone but my parents knew what she had done I decided that I would give a speech as they all requested. I said they were all disgusting, selfish and ignorant. I said they won\u2019t be part of my life if they won\u2019t respect the one thing I asked and that since everyone knew I don\u2019t know the gender someone must have broken the law for them all to know when even I don\u2019t. \n\nOur parents lost their minds. My mom told me to go to the kitchen and sit down so they could deal with it without causing me stress. There was a lot of screaming and shouting, I\u2019ve only heard my stepdad shout once before and that was when there was a firework accident when I was 15. \nThey told everyone to get their shit and get out. \n\nAmy threw a gift at me, a personalised baby outfit, on top of everything she decided she was going to be naming my baby as evident by the name printed across the very bright outfit. This made it even worse and I threw it straight into the open fire while staring at her. She left crying and screaming that I was an ungrateful bitch for ruining her happiness and her day. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve only spoke to my parents who are being so great at shielding me from everyone. They\u2019re being called horrible names and I\u2019m wondering if I was in the wrong to kick off so much.
