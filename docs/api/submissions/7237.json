You make serious accusations. My daughter is healthy, and she told me about all the vegetarian foods her dad cooks for her. The reason she had lost weight is probably puberty.  My girl would never lie to me, so dont project \"\n\nSo what tf am I supposed to do now? Talk again and record my niece?\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\n- Niece's mum is real an idiot : \"By the way I was with him before you were born. I have lived with him, which you never did. Are you the one who carried his child? So I probably know him better than you.\"  What the hell does it even mean?  Obviously I didn't carry his child, I am his sister. \n\n- Brother 2 & 4 called me to ask me to stop spreading rumour. Because niece's mum called them to complain about me.\n\nSo much in one day. But thank you for everyone's comment. It helped me to do the right thing. Now I know the mum is a bitch too at least.\n\nI can definitely record my brother talk, because he openly talks about it.

You're NTA. That kid is being starved, they're actively pushing meat on her aggressively when she said she doesn't want to eat it, saying she needs to lose weight, needs to learn to \"obey\" authority, is all just super duper fucked up behavior from them. \n  \nThat being said, I've been a vegetarian for 13 years now, and no she cannot just eat vegetables alone.

If your parents are around and decent, talk with them about how to handle it. Sometimes you need to stay in your lane but this is not one of those times. \n\n2. Make a call. If this was one of my nieces and I tried to get through to my brother and his wife and got the same response that you did I would call CPS. Is it extreme? Yes. Is it in the best interest of your niece? Absolutely. They will investigate the situation. A call to CPS does not mean she will be removed from their custody. It means someone who is trained and equipped to deal with abusive situations will be involved. \n\nI wish you luck and strength.

Get the evidence first, report later. Do you have pictures from a few months ago and from today to show how much weight she has lost?\n\nAnd tell niece she can complain of being starved to a teacher or school counselor, they by law MUST report this to CPS, who then must investigate.

If you get another chance to talk to him you might ask him what his plan is as he transitions from being the parent who tells a kid what to do to being a parent who helps their child make good decisions for themselves and eventually transitions to being the parent of an adult child.

Dad was NOT just teaching his kid anything except cruelty on delivery of information.\n\nEdit to add:  And then all of a sudden the fridge is packed with lots of meat.  That's even more cruel.
