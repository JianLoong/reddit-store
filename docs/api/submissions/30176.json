Was your brother doing this to spite you? (I had to ask) did your son like the new hair? Did he have a sucky \u201cmodern cut\u201d?

I always find these sorts of discussions about children without mention of how the child feels to be quite cringe.  Children even as young as 5 are in fact people with valid feelings and opinions.", "NTA. That is YOUR kid and he is stomping all over your boundaries. If he'll do it with things like haircuts, what else will he do with or to your child that you have said no to? Will he let your kid try alcohol? Give them food that makes them sick? Play with things that are dangerous, or in places you don't want them to like near deep water or open fires?   \n\n\nYou need to tell him that he doesn't get to see your son unsupervised at all ever again.

I'm sick of your excuses, I'm sick of you insisting you did nothing wrong when you keep doing things without asking us, HIS PARENTS, first.

You win", "I guess I'm just trying to understand your reasoning. You say that a 5 year old's wishes regarding getting a haircut is irrelevant because they're a minor whose parent is legally responsible.
