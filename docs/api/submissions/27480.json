The real victims here are Claire and that future kid.", "If your sister can't afford another child, then she should make sure she doesn't pregnant.\n\nShe didn't.

She has options that do not require her to raise another child that she cannot afford. Depending on your relationship with your niece, you might offer to let only her stay while her mom figures things out. Poor kid certainly needs an adult in her life that can be a good example.", "NTA. It\u2019s not hard to not get pregnant. Her choices and mistakes are not your problem.  If she needs money she should track down the dads and sue for child support. I honestly do not believe that she has no idea who they are.", "NTA. I feel bad for your sisters situation, but you didn't make it. She must have a vague idea who the baby daddy is? She can go to him and ask him to support his own child.", "NTA. Tell her to get on birth control. I'd tell her that, & to get an abortion.", "NTA- I had a friend growing up who was \u201cClair\u201d in this situation.

Perhaps she will take her life choices seriously if she is forced to live life without the safety net of mom and dad or sister. Let her be mad. She needs to learn.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. You\u2019re still trying to find your own footing in life and taking in Ella at this point will only hinder your own goals. Since there are innocent children involved, you may want to consider helping Ella financially if possible on your end.", "Wait, \"she won't say who the father is\"? That's a red flag on top of what's already wrong in this. NTA, I wouldn't want to get involved in this as well.", "U r not the asshole. She made her own bed, she can lie in it. U got ur own shit to deal with, don't need her drama too.", "NTA Your sister made her bed, now she has to lie in it. She can contact social services to determine if she qualifies for rental assistance and other safety net programs to take care of her growing family. Plenty of single mothers manage to get by without the all of the help your sister has received from your parents. She's has nine years or get her act together.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
