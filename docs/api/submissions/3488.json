In this case, it's emphasis in something you were saying to her, not cussing her out per se. \n\ni know Im being pedantic but it's a relevant difference to me. \n\nanyway, you have the right to be pissed off. I don't think swearing, pretty understandably, in front of her grandfather is anything like the same level as her sharing private information about you to the family. \n\nNTA", "NTA, but your GF is, especially given she's no remorse over it.  Any idea why she did it?", "NTA that\u2019s an appropriate response esp if she randomly said it not in conversation or anything. If someone is upset by cursing they need to get over themselves fr", "NTA. It was a normal impulsive response. What the hell was she thinking.", "NTA, sounds like a normal reaction to that scenario. A WTF moment.", "\"WTF?\" is a legitimate question to ask when someone close to you spontaneously (and apparently gratuitously) shares your private information with a group of people. And frankly, whether the swear word made her uncomfortable or not, she should have given you an answer to your question. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nHer grandfather was probably thinking \"wtf\" as well.", "NTA Lol. I said WTF out loud before I read where you said WTF. Why would see do something so strange at a holiday? Be careful not to tell her any new secrets because Christmas is coming up soon. You should remind your GF that ever action has a reaction. Was you reaction appropriate maybe not. But you wouldn't have said WTF without her publicly shaming you first.", "NTA", "Wow don\u2019t tell her any secrets. How f\u2019in embarrassing and I\u2019m feeling second hand embarrassment for you. Youch. NTA. If she\u2019s looking for small talk with family start with your own damn secrets or weather like normal people.", "NTA. Maybe you could've said it better but there was no reason for her to bring that up.", "You could have phrasesed it differently however  you are right it's your business and No one else's. I also asked my brother and he says it's all your girlfriends fault", "NTA If you haven't learned it yet. It's about time. Anything you tell your woman is now known by all of her friends and family.", "NTA although some people might have been offended by the language (not me!) but you were caught off guard.\n\nWTF is a better response then most of the snarky responses that are coming to my mind right now\u2026\n\nYou know like \u201cWell at least I don\u2019t need the little blue pill right?\u201d\nOr \n\u201cGreat. Are we going to have to talk about that rash you have now?\u201d /s\n\nIs your girlfriend usually this socially graceless because yikes!! I don\u2019t blame you a bit for responding like you did. But if this is a common occurrence you might want to come up with a few light and funny responses to have on lock for such situations.", "NTA\n\nYour choice to share that information, not hers.", "NTA but maybe it's time to get a new girlfriend, at least one that won't reveal your personal information as a topic of conversation.\n\nI can't imagine how she will act with a more serious issue.", "NTA. You were caught off guard. What an absolutely idiotic thing to say, there\u2019s no way what she said was appropriate. It\u2019s YOUR medical condition, no one else\u2019s. Yes you didn\u2019t need to swear, but again you was caught off guard. Maybe you need to apologise for bad language, but that\u2019s all. Your reaction was justified. Outrage/shock. Seems fitting.", "Your gf is either a child, or the next best comedian of our time.

Even if everybody was telling what medicines they were taking it was only her own medications that she could share if she desired. Someone says food is good. And she blurts out bf is taking rogaine. Cringing a bit at your burst out. But will ignore it as it took you by surprise. I would be upset if somebody told others I was treating something of a personal nature and feel sure she would have wanted to crawl under the table if you had done the same to her.", "I'm trying to figure out in what context she could have possibly brought that into conversation and I'm coming up blank.\n\nYou're NTA", "NTA, what the actual hell!?!\n\nThat was so out of line to begin with, then add to it the emotional 'reaction' to your understandable confusion is incredibly childish, especially the whole charade of playing innocent when she was the one to create the entire situation!", "NTA, she was in the wrong here, and you didn't swear at her, you used an expletive when asking a question. Sorry that happened to you. Best of Luck.", "NTA but I do recommend you sit down and explain to her how that made you feel. We tend to get stuck in our own feelings and she may not realize how hurtful her actions were. Take this as an opportunity to open up and be vulnerable to her. Im sure she'll be more understanding.", "Dump her.", "NTA  \n\n\nW.T.F is the only response I could have come up with too! I've read your comments about why she blurted out your private information and I still can't see why she would say what she did. It served no purpose other than to embarrass you. \n\nTell her that if she's mortified about her grandfather hearing an F-bomb, imagine how mortified you and he both are at her lack of tact with your private medical information.", "Dude people say things all the time. Learn how to respond to things in context. Not an asshole but you suck lol. To her family you said \"what the fuck\" to her at the table in front of everyone. You probably know better with how they took that which is a crucial point in understanding how you will be seen in future family functions.", "EHS\n\nShe sucks for sharing that private information. You suck for being incapable of brushing it off. \n\nYou guys might need a little more maturing.", "Totally agree about the swearing, being directly sworn at is much worse than what OP did", "I honestly believe she was trying to make conversation, because someone made a comment about how I have a lot of hair. I guess the medication works at least.", "OP did say someone else complimented the amount of hair OP has. It may have just been a faux pas because the compliment was so strange and GF just blurted something out?", "OP said someone complimented how much hair he has.", "Why does he need to brush it off? She embarrassed him, I don't see why he should just let it go instead of calling it out right when it happens", "So her response was to diminish their comment by pointing out you take medication for it? Wtf. It sounds like she purposely was being passive aggressive towards you and is pissed that you were direct in your response back to her.", "Could be mature about it", "Could be that GF is merely anxious/awkward in social situations.\nAs well as immature for refusing to admit that she mistepped.\n(TBH I can totally see younger me in the shoes of the GF up to that point. I wouldn't have blamed OP for reacting though - if I'm unable to control what I say, why should other people have to?)\n\nAnyway I agree that OP is NTA and GF is TA for blaming OP for the swearing.", "Why would you assume that? She could've been saying something supportive such as \"yeah! It looks amazing! That medication is really working\". Not saying she should say that, but youre making assumptions that you have no evidence to base on."]}
