Learn how to respond to things in context. Not an asshole but you suck lol. To her family you said \"what the fuck\" to her at the table in front of everyone.

Your girlfriend should have had more sense than to say what she did but it doesn't seem to have been done with malicious intent and everyone screws up from time to time.

If they say the situation is bullshit or if they blurted out 'what the fuck' I might remind them of our policy if they sound aggressive but otherwise just get on with helping them, because being sworn at to me is much worse than the situation being sworn at.", "She deserved to get directly sworn at tbh.", "How?", "Yeah. I 100% agree. I was just pointing out that we shouldn't be assuming her intentions at all. We have no idea of she was trying to be passive aggressive and we can't assume tone since none of us was there. OP already said they thought she was being genuine, so it makes no sense to sit here and speculate shes evil or whatever. Sometimes nice and kind people are assholes, those moments don't speak to their whole character.", "Then she would have felt remorse and apologized for how she made her partner feel.", "Look, thats not necessarily true. I say that as someone who has 1) put her foot in her mouth many times and 2) as someone with a psych degree who has a lot of experience in the therapeutic world. The GF is definitely the AH in this situation, but yall are assuming so much. Maybe she does feel remorse, but she's too embarrassed to do anything about it. Maybe she doesn't realize how upsetting it was to her partner. Maybe she doesn't want to acknowledge she messed up. Who knows? Not you and not me. \n\nI think OP should sit down in a serious conversation and explain how her comments made them feel. Just from reading what was posted, im willing to bet she got defensive. If they want to work through it, OP and her need to be open to hearing each other out and talking it through.\n\nBut yeah. I dont think we can assume anything about her intentions. People are complex and have layers and layers of experiences, perceptions, and reasoning behind how they interact in the world. I hate when people read a 4 paragraph post and assume they know exactly what was behind someones actions. We don't know shit.", "This is so\u2026weird. What is her deal? Can she not keep a secret?

Maybe she was I'll at least and that's what came to mind. Tell her she owes you an apology because that is private info and to never be shared again. You didn't swear at her, you just exclaimed in shock, so not a big deal. As long as you don't swear like a sailor I'm sure the family won't think your awful!!", "I make one tongue in cheek joke, and I get a lecture.

A \u201cF you\u201d is totally warranted in this case.", "Swear words can be serious or unserious. I'm Australian, 'fuck' is just a filler word here most the time. But saying 'f\\*ck you' to your gf in anger is serious.\n\nAs I have already said, gf did bad, seemingly thoughtlessly but not malciously. Her lack of remorse is also bad, but not relevant to judging the swearing, because her lack of remorse hadn't happened yet at the time he said 'what the fuck'\n\nGF was thoughtless and rude, seemingly without meaning to be. But a f\\*ck you said seriously in that moment would be aggressive and reflect an intentional disrepect that I don't think should be in relationships.", "But getting defensive after spilling private information is an asshole move. If she was truly remorseful, she should have publicly apologized since her offense was public as well", "It definitely is? Where do you think I'm saying shes not the asshole in this situation??? Im just saying one stint of assholeness doesn't 1) tell us her intentions or 2) make her a horrible person. Im tired of ppl acting like someone is toxic or emotionally abusive because they're human.", "NTA. \n\nSo she can be near tears and mad days later because you said fuck at the table, but has no remorse for purposefully embarrassing you at the table? You've got a real victim on your hands. \n\nYou are right to be upset about what she said, and you didn't call her names or yell at her, you blurted out a pretty common phrase to being surprised/embarrassed. She does need to apologize, while you have nothing to apologize for.", "Nta, she is overreacting.", "OP, if you stay together with this woman, imagine to yourself what other personal info she might blurt out at future family dinners. \"OP has to take Viagra sometimes.\" \"He has really stinky feet and has to wear special insoles in his shoes.\" \"OP has x dollars in his savings account.\" \"OP likes to talk dirty when we have sex.\"\nThink about what your life would be like if every intimate secret you share with this woman will be blurted out at family gatherings in an effort to start conversation.", "Her words were imbecilic.

She TA for outing your medical issue, not cool.", "NTA I am sure grandpa has heard it before. She is an AH", "NTA \n\nThat sounds like a normal response to her sharing *your* medical news.\n\nI am more concerned that she feels entitled to share whatever she wants about your life with others.", "NTA.  If you stay in this relationship, you will have to accept that your gf has no filters and doesn't recognize basic social mores.", "NTA. A very valid question actually. Why would she do that?", "I think your gf didn\u2019t realize that you would be upset, and she was just making conversation.

I am more concerned why she felt the need to blurt something like this out??!!?? Next time, your GF gets a yeast infection...DO THE SAME DAMN THING and in a public place at a table with friends. \"\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ has a yeast infection and is on medication\" since she doesnt see anything wrong with blurting out ones medical issues.  This made me MAD yo.", "NTA.  Ask her she would feel if you told your family she was taking medication for a vaginal infection or something equally as personal. See if she would like that. She owes an apology and needs to understand that that is your information to share is you choose to, not hers and not to blurt personal information to other people.", "Nta. I would rethink this relationship.

Or Dale Carnegie's Interpersonal Relations course.\n\nCause she needs to learn some basic conversation skills.", "OP, it\u2019s up to you\u2014either have an honest conversation about how you were embarrassed and ask her to not reveal your medical problem again while apologizing for your outburst (assuming that she will own her mistake as well) or die on this hill and ruin your relationship. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth saving; only you do\u2014but dying on this hill will be the end of it anyway.", "I don\u2019t think she saw male pattern baldness and the treatment of it to be embarrassing or something she needed to be secretive about. The OP is upset, and now she knows that she shouldn\u2019t talk about it, but I feel it was an honest mistake. I would think much less of someone who overreacted and cursed at a family dinner than someone who made an honest mistake. I, personally, think bald is sexy.", "Then that's on her because male pattern baldness embarrasses lots of men. Hence an entire industry of wigs, toupees and medication. Oh and actual surgical procedures.", "I did say that now she should know better than to out him, but I think she had no ill-intent, and he should have been able to control himself without having an angry, cursing outburst at the table. Just because someone says something you don\u2019t like doesn\u2019t give you the right to yell and curse. I think this world would benefit from less screaming and cursing and more talking and forgiving. Many people disagree, it seems."]}
