Let\u2019s call them Chad & Brad. They made conversation & offered to buy us drinks, which we accepted. They asked where we were from, what we did for work, etc but never asked about our relationship statuses. My sister is single, & I\u2019m in a relationship. *My boyfriend & I had spoken before about situations like this before & he always said that he didn\u2019t care if a guy at a bar hits on me & buys me drinks, as long as nothing inappropriate happens (like physical contact).*\n\nAnyways, we spent the night hanging out with Chad, Brad, & a few other guy friends of theirs. There was a live band (very loud) & it was super crowded where we were standing, so there wasn\u2019t a ton of conversation going on between all of us. It was fun & the guys kept offering to get us drinks whenever ours were running low. We never asked them to get more, they just offered & we said yes. They were super nice about it, not pushy or creepy. They ended up getting me about 4 or 5 drinks (wine) over the course of 2-3 hours. There was no flirting on my end, no physical contact, but I was being friendly & dancing & having fun. At one point he put his arm across my shoulders & I immediately took it off. \n\nLater in the night, I mentioned that I have a boyfriend. I was drunk at this point & wanted to make sure it was clear that I was not an available option. Brad, who was the primary one talking to me, was disappointed but fine with it. Chad, his friend, was a little more upset & told me that I should\u2019ve told them at the beginning before they bought us all those drinks. I reminded him that they never asked & if they had, I happily would\u2019ve told them. I said that if their primary purpose in buying a drink for a woman is to get laid, they should probably check that they\u2019re single first. Their friend group (jokingly?) was like \u201coh she\u2019s in a relationship, let\u2019s go\u201d & acted like they were all gonna ditch us at this point. We ended up hanging out for a little longer, but a couple of the guys seemed really annoyed that I had a boyfriend & hadn\u2019t mentioned it right away.\n\nI personally feel like it was their job to ask, especially as they weren\u2019t being outwardly flirty when they initially approached us. I don\u2019t feel like I need to greet every guy that I talk to at a bar with \u201cI have a boyfriend.\u201d I\u2019ll happily tell a guy if he asks, but I don\u2019t like to assume that every guy that talks to me or offers me a drink it\u2019s trying to get with me - & if he is, I\u2019d expect him to check that I\u2019m single OR not get upset if he later finds out (after buying me drinks) that I\u2019m not.\n\nEDIT: I guess the real question is, whose responsibility is it to confirm singleness? Is it the person *doing* the hitting on to ask or the person *being* hit on to mention right away if they\u2019re not?", "created_utc": 1669488767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5evh9/aita_for_not_mentioning_that_i_have_a_boyfriend/", "score": 229, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd state this up front because I just don't want to be misunderstood or seem like I'm digging gold either. Five glasses of wine might be about $50, which is more than I think a stranger expects to spend on me just for the opportunity to get to know me, after all.\n\nSo, unfortunately, I can see why people feel YTA. After the first drink, you should have told him you already have a BF.", "INFO: did you at any point offer to get the next round, or was it assumed the men would buy each round? \n\nIt's fine you didn't tell them you had a bf, but it's good manners -- and keeps it comfortably platonic -- if you alternate rounds.", "ESH.

Accepting more than one drink, engaging in conversation etc and not mentioning that you have a boyfriend does set up the dynamic that you\u2019re single and receptive to possibly getting to know someone better (and I mean getting to know someone not going to bed with them). \n\nAt a bar on Monday with a male friend, I was buying the drinks. Got chatting whilst waiting to be served. I was offered a drink. I said \u2018if you buy me one you have to buy him one\u2019 indicating my friend.

I never bought drinks thinking it would get me laid. That\u2019s what flirting and conversation is for. I bought people drinks if i liked drinking with them. I bought people drinks to prevent bar fights from happening. It\u2019s a gesture of goodwill and nothing more. Anything else is a weird reason to buy drinks for a stranger.", "I am going with YTA on this one.\n\nbuying a woman a drink at a bar is an act of courtship. The person who said that you talk to the guy while you drink it is technically correct, but in spirit the conversation is supposed to be one of amorous pursuit: you don't get handed a mimosa by a stranger to discuss Manchester city VS Liverpool.\n\nWhen you accept a drink you accept the invitation of courtship. When you accept several drinks you indicate willingness to be pursued romantically.\n\nSo OP is leading these men on by way of omission and imho also emotionally cheating on her BF.", "Accepting a drink is fine. The buying of a drink from us dudes is the first step after \"hi\" in our nonsensical mating rituals.

You're taking their time and their money, and you know damn well 9 times out if 10 they're more interested in just conversation and a goodbye never to be seen again. If the dude was cool, accept that drink but tell him you're taken, any real man worth his salt will continue the convo until the drink is done then politely excuse him self unless you're particularly interesting (you're probably not).

And that's why you didn't say anything.", "ESH. Leaning more towards YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s common sense that when a man is buying you a drink at the bar, he is likely showing interest. Let alone 4-5 drinks. That\u2019s not cheap, and it honestly sounds like you took advantage of the free drinks. Yes, the guys could\u2019ve asked but it sounds like they didn\u2019t think to because you were happily accepting their drinks.", "You didn\u2019t tell them off the bat because you knew the free drinks would stop, not because it just slipped your mind or something. You knew what you were doing. One drink, fine. 5? YTA", "NTA - Buying a girl a drink does not automatically mean you're going to get laid. If that's the only reason you're buying a girl a drink, you have to accept the risk of failure/decline.\n\nYou and your sister were having a good time (and so were they it seems), it's not like you took the drink and walked away.

However, it\u2019s a given that if a guy wants to buy you drinks then he probably wants something sexual. Taking 1 or 2 drinks is fine but after that, you are taking advantage of him by accepting the drinks when you aren\u2019t interested. If you turn down the drinks, it sends a CLEAR message.", "NTA A guy should ask if it matters to him, if he has expectations\n\n\"Can I buy you a drink?\" Is a \"yes\" or \"no\" question, just like \"Do you have a boyfriend?\"", "NTA. If the purpose of getting a stranger tipsy or drunk is to make it easier to get in her pants, you\u2019re a creep to begin with, but moreover, they definitely had a responsibility to ask.

You're right its weird to lead off with 'I'm Name and I have a boyfriend.' They should have asked if the only reason they were buying your drinks was the sole purpose of sleeping with you. If someone buys you a drink, you are not obligated to sleep with them, kiss them, anything.\n\nEdit: for those saying, \"why else would they be buying you drinks?\" I don't give a damn why they offer; that's on them.

They are clearly there to meet people and you were taking advantage of them.  The ones saying drinks equal sex definitely suck but it doesn\u2019t sound like the guy that you were mooching off of did he was just disappointed.  So actually you are the asshole.", "NTA. Buying you drinks does not mean you owe them anything. It's on them of they assumed that they were buying their way into your bed.", "YTA. You knew full well when they kept buying you drinks what their end game was. You played the game of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" in hopes of getting free drinks and it worked for you this time. The guys who called you out, were absolutely correct in doing so. You should make it known upfront, that you are not single. It's amazing that women can do this and see no issue with it.", "YTA\n\nYou could have easily slipped in, \u201c my bf really likes this band\u2026\u201d or something to show that you weren\u2019t interested. 1-2 drinks in? No problem.\n\n4-5? Come on, you were just taking advantage of the man at that point.\n\nEdit: confirmed with my wife. You should be upfront about your status before the first drink.
