Let him source another wedding venue but seeing as he doesn't know adam then he shoud just let it go.", "NTA. Even under the best of circumstances, you\u2019re not obligated to help anyone promote their business. \nI\u2019m just not sure why you didn\u2019t tell him in the first place that Adam already had a photographer instead of lying by promising to ask him.  I feel like you could\u2019ve nipped this in the bud instead of stringing the guy along with making him think he had a chance.", "NTA\n\nJimmy should have business cards or something so then Adam and/or Stephanie can ask themselves. It's ultimately not your decision.\n\nThat and, sorry, a photographer with zero experience that's not a close friend of the families getting married just ain't gonna fly. This is one of the most important days of Jimmy and Steph's life and the last thing they need is potentially subpar photos.", "NTA having a second photographer there (even a free one) could cause a ton of issues. The original photographer child feel disrespected and quit. He could get in the way of the photographer on important shots. It would be confusing and annoying. He needs to find some other way to get experience. I'm sure some couples would jump at the opportunity to have a free photographer. I don't know how photographers get experience, but this ain't it.", "As a former wedding photographer, NTA.\n\nIf you're going to recommend a wedding photographer to a close friend or relative, you wanna make sure they're good. Even if Adam and Steph have a photographer ready to go, you don't know what skills this other guy has. He may get in the way of the actual photographer and that will really upset the bride and groom. Also, he may not have any shooting and editing skills, so the pictures may come out crappy. Never have someone practice on people you know.\n\nThere are TONS of people who will take free photos for their wedding.", "NTA.  Adding someone else at the last minute would add to the stress your friends, I\u2019m assuming good ones since you are in the wedding, have already stated they are under and you are protecting them.  Also, the chances that Jimmy would interfere with the other photographer, even by accident, are pretty high as they both go for great photos.  Weddings are filled with fleeting moments and if the photographer misses them they are gone forever.  The day is about your friends\u2019 wedding, not your acquaintance\u2019s photography business.  Nice job.", "NTA Jimmy seems entitled AF", "NTA  I used to process films for several professional photographers. Their biggest complaint about wedding photography was random folk leaping about taking photos while they were trying to work. It stretches out an already lengthy process and can mean that people are looking in different directions in the photos. Very annoying when you are there to do your job.\n\nIf your friend is serious about getting experience taking wedding shots, tell him to contact the professional photographers (not for your friend's wedding though). He can ask if they would allow him to shadow them and take additional shots while there. Photographers often have assistants who will take crowd shots, guest shots etc. as part of the more expensive packages.  As weddings tend to be at the weekend it wouldn't interfere with his work and he could make a bit extra on the side.", "NTA. Jimmy is being very entitled and has a lot to learn if he thinks he's just going to jump in and start annoying sought-after local photographers right off the bat. You probably should have been honest with him from the jump (yes they have a photographer) but you didnt' deny him any opportunities, there was no opportunity here.", "NTA.\n\nReminds me of a rant one of my friends posted on facebook about noone supporting her bc none of us buy her Etsy stuff. Sorry, but your entire career is pyramid schemes. No thanks.", "NTA because of your first 2 points and because it's not your wedding (obv).\n\nThe 3rd point would actually be a good reason for him to be a volunteer alongside the photographer. But you don't ask that of an acquaintance, let alone asking the acquaintance to ask his friend.", "NTA\n\nHowever, it may be more effective to not make the discussion about you, and what you are comfortable doing.\n\n\"The wedding is next week.  They're in the final stages of prepping and organizing.  If you are interested in this, you need to talk to the bride and groom directly to make a plan.  It will take too long and have too much room for error or misunderstanding if you try to plan using a go-between at the last minute.\"", "I went to my cousin's wedding when I was about 10. I was nearby when the wedding party was getting some group pictures. Since I had a camera, I started taking pictures too. The professional photographer had to tell people to ignore me and look at him. Since I was a kid, everybody laughed. If an adult tried to horn in on the professional's territory, it would have been different. For that alone, NTA.", "NTA. The photographer has a say in this as well and most professionals do not A. Want to train the competition B. Have someone in the way C. Want them asking questions while they are trying to work.\n\nI can't imagine the photographer agreeing to this and   many have clauses in their contracts about other photographers and them getting in the way, copying their shots.", "NTA\n\nHe asked if you would ask, you don't feel comfortable doing so. It's not your job to promote his business.", "NTA but these are the kind of situations that little white lies are made for.  You aren't close to him and he doesn't know your friends or their photographer at all.  Just say that the photographer doesn't want someone he doesn't know potentially getting in the way of his work.  It's pbly not even really a lie. Most photographers would not like an amateur likely trying to get the same shots they are", "NTA. That would cause a lot of problems anyway, including that most professional photographers won't go for having another photographer around, since they get in the way.", ">I told him they had a photographer whom he was paying for, and Jimmy then told me he didn't plan to take the photographer's place, he would just plan to work alongside the photographer shoot highlights for free to build his portfolio, and then Adam and Stephanie could keep all the photos.\n\nNo. It might even be banned in the photographer's contract to have another person working there. There is a good chance Jimmy would be in the way. Your friends aren't going to say yes to this. \n\n>Now Jimmy's really upset, saying I'm \"not being supportive of a single dad's small business\".\n\nOh please. Jimmy has never photographed a wedding. This isn't your wedding. NTA.", "NTA", "Just because he ***WANTS*** to doesn't mean he has to be allowed to.  It isn't his right to take anyone's pictures.  NTA.", "NTA\n\n\"not being supportive of a single dad's small business\".\n\nThis is grotesquely manipulative. Please do not let this work on you. Jimmy's life choices are his burden to bear. In no way are his desires, stressors or plans your problem.", "NTA. Tell Jimmy the wedding is not about him.", "NTA.  The photographer they are paying is not going to want done other guy getting in his way, he will have enough of a problem with people attending the wedding doing that.  This was a bad idea from the start.", "You don\u2019t know if Jimmy is any good as a photographer, both the quality of his pictures and his professional presence.  This means endorsing him would be a risk for you.  NTA", "NTA.   Jerks try to use that \"not being supportive\" line a lot", "NTA, if Jimmy wants to build his portfolio, he should post in local Facebook groups or Front Porch Forum or whatever and say he\u2019s trying to build a portfolio and would love to take X and Y types of photos of people for free and see if anyone takes him up on it. There have been similar posts in groups near me that have gotten a lot of interest. No need for him to make it weird at your job at all", "NTA- they hired a pro already. A pro wouldn't want to work with a rando for so many reasons. Jimmy would likely get in the way of the actual photographer.\n\nHis poor reaction and manipulation are going to harm his business.", "NTA No photographer wants some second one run in their pictures. And if i see how eager your co-worker is to build up his portfolio, he will run in front of the paid photographer just to get better shoots like at the ceremony. I mean there must be coordination when there are more then one people taking pics. But can you see this here? \nAnd his behaviour is so unprofessionell already. He ruins himself that you recommend him to others (not that you would...).\n\nHe never even done a wedding before! Like what?! And this guilt-tripping and manipulating shit of \"single dads business\". \n\nAll is speaking \"don't let him make even one picture of you!\" \n\nSince he is a co-worker, his behaviour is especially ugly. If he keeps getting on your nerves or treating you shitting, or talk bad to others because you didn\u2019t let him play wedding photographer, go to your boss or hr. He can't use his collegues to promote his business and then sulk when they say \"nope\"", "NTA.\n\nIf Jimmy wants to really photograph for this wedding he can ask himself. That's a really bizarre thing to ask of someone for their wedding day.", "NTA.\n\nJimmy can ask himself, but either way, he needs more practice and maturity first.", "NAH - Was going to go with NTA, but I want to give \"Jimmy\" the benefit of the doubt here. Starting a new business is tough, and I'm sure he thought this would be a no brainer for the couple since \"who wouldn't want a free photographer\". But, you need to do right by your friends and make this judgement call. Stand by it.", "NTA- you were polite and you said no and that is the end of story.

Tell him he needs to seek opportunities out on his own from now on.", "Na he\u2019s just sensitive", "YTA. You know the answer is no yet you did everything but say no. Just say no. No Jimmy, they don't want you to take photos at their wedding, they got it covered and they wouldn't want a stranger who is just trying to build their portfolio. \n\nYou know the answer. \n\nJust give it.  \n\nAt a certain point, your unwillingness to give bad news makes you an AH for stringing this along for so long.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
