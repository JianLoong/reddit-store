I invited 30 of my closest friends and family and we booked out a function room in a restaurant. The whole night including drinks was on me.

The night cost us $4500 which was food, drinks, cocktails etc at a very nice restaurant. \n\nOf the 30 guests, 10 of them didn't buy me a present. This would bother 95% of us I assume. Normally I wouldn't say anything as I've avoided confrontation my whole life but this last year or two I've kinda adopted the \"fuck it\" attitude and am more direct with communicating my feelings. I stewed on it for two weeks but then confronted those friends (keep in mind I've always bought my friends gifts whether they have parties or not). Most of them got awkward and said a present was coming. But a couple of them thought I was rude and entitled for bringing it up. I particularly cracked it one of them as they were rude to me about it and I bloody spent $150 a head on her and her partner which is something she would never do. She earns three time what I earn but is a Scrooge. \n\nAnyway.

I invited 30 of my closest friends and family and we booked out a function room in a restaurant. The whole night including drinks was on me. My wife and I are not that well off but we saved up all year for this. The night cost us $4500 which was food, drinks, cocktails etc at a very nice restaurant. \n\nOf the 30 guests, 10 of them didn't buy me a present. This would bother 95% of us I assume. Normally I wouldn't say anything as I've avoided confrontation my whole life but this last year or two I've kinda adopted the \"fuck it\" attitude and am more direct with communicating my feelings. I stewed on it for two weeks but then confronted those friends (keep in mind I've always bought my friends gifts whether they have parties or not). Most of them got awkward and said a present was coming. But a couple of them thought I was rude and entitled for bringing it up. I particularly cracked it one of them as they were rude to me about it and I bloody spent $150 a head on her and her partner which is something she would never do. She earns three time what I earn but is a Scrooge. \n\nAnyway. Am I ok for confronting this or am I an entitled asshole??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Just confronted some shit behaviour from friends I've done a lot for. Overzealous? Yep probably and I'll learn from it.", "My 50th will be awesome. Already got it planned out.", "Sounds like cultural differences too. Being Sri Lankan we are drilled to always bring gifts.no matter what value. I still remember my Dad cracking the shits when I only gave $50 to a distant cousins wedding.

I'll take that on board.", "I might push back on the idea of gifts being universally traditional. As adults, my friends and I have never exchanged birthday gifts. It would seem strange to do so. When my elementary age kids receive birthday party invitations the invite almost always specifies \u201cno gifts\u201d so, even for them, taking a gift to a party is not the norm.", "I am grateful they turned up.

No card. \n\nAny it's also worth pointing out the same people who didn't get gifts were also the same who didn't thank me for the dinner. \n.just shows me some people are just takers.", "I spent that much as it's my favourite restaurant and wanted to share it with my closest friends and family.", "Thank you. I'm realising that not everyone has the same expectations on gift giving for different reasons. I was raised to never ever go to someone else's event, dinner party, birthday empty handed.

Not so for your average Redditor however.", "Exactly, thank you. Yes the badgering I'm not proud of.

I wanted to be generous.", "I disagree. My friendship group of blokes certainly do and we love it. It's personal and we bond over the gifts. It's cool if your friendship group don't but it's a bit naive yo simply state dudes our age don't do gifts.", "Thanks. I didn't spend that much with the intention of getting that in return. Its just that I would never rock up to a 40th without a gift whether it was a $50 picnic or a $20000 lavish dinner.", "So the guests should have known the dollar amount OP was spending ahead of time? If OP wanted to make it transactional, he could have included that on the invitation. Most birthday parties for people over the age of about 12 don't 'require' a birthday present. Should OP have listed a minimum dollar amount for the gift too?", "Why though? Because then I'm lowering my standards to suit them. That would truly make me the asshole. I'll keep giving thanks.", "I don't. I give regardless. Am I not allowed to say on the one event that is actually for me it hurt a little to not have people return the favour?", "Lol. You know shit about me.", "Where did I state that was the purpose to my party? You're making assumptions which makes you the asshole.", "They're my close friends.

Look, communication isn't always necessary, and there is very little point in scolding people for not doing something they should have done out of love for you. I understand your disappointment, but standing up for yourself in this case shouldn't be by confronting them, but by noting their ingratitude and re-examining the friendship. If this was one-off thoughtlessness on their part, but they are supportive and good friends otherwise, let it go. If they are generally selfish and your friendship is you giving and them taking, distance yourself from them. Personally, I don't even bother cutting such people off, I just relegate them to friendly aquaintances; if they mind the distance, they can do the work to be better friends/", "Lol. You \u201corganize ahead with your wife\u201d. So\u2026your wife is actually the one doing the emotional and physical labor in this ridiculous gifting scheme. Now you\u2019re a double asshole.\n\nAlso, you have decided to be a more direct communicator at 40.

You give others something, you expect something in return. For a lot of people, that's very uncomfortable - I'd rather receive nothing at all than be given things with unspoken expectations. You didn't even give your friends the opportunity to turn down this transaction, you assumed it was expected without even informing them. That's why you're getting such a negative reaction.", "Spending their evening with you is caring. Caring does not need to be in material form.", "Because most people are not putting this much thought in receiving a gift \ud83d\ude02", "But you'll confront people for not bringing one, which is just as audacious, if not more so.

Personally I think spontaneous gifts matter way, way more than \u201cugh I had to buy you something so here, have a candle\u201d. Personally I think gift giving is stupid when it\u2019s an obligation. Why am I spending $50 on something you won\u2019t want, and come my birthday you are spending $50 on something I won\u2019t want, when instead we could each just spend that money on something we actually want.\n\nAll this is, I\u2019m pretty sure, is cultures clashing. It\u2019s perfectly okay to place a bigger emphasis on gifts, but if they matter to you you need to tell people. Because if I was invited to your birthday, I would be: 1, expecting to pay for my own drinks, and 2, not aware that a gift was so important to you. If you were just disappointed, this would be N A H, but confronting them after changes it to YTA.\n\nThis boils down to: tell people your expectations! Don\u2019t expect them to read your mind!

If you\u2019re invited to a party or event where someone else is paying, the polite thing to do is bring a gift or invite them next time.

Having said that, just make a mental note and don\u2019t put much effort in for them next time. Your reaction was unnecessary and childish. \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH.", "No please dont stop with this but spread it. The whole mandatory gift thing because of social norms make me sick. its all about the money nowadays. We have to buy gift for people that already have everything they want...

Anyone who needs appreciation expressed through a trinket rather than a sincere thank you should please feel free to say so loudly so the rest of us can avoid their materialistic nonsense.", "Fuck accepted social customs.

Instead, I focus on getting the date and time right and preparing myself mentally/emotionally to be around so many people so I don\u2019t get overwhelmed and have to leave early.\n\nGifts are a nice gesture but so is someone overcoming severe anxiety to spend time with you, finding childcare for a night out, traveling long distances, and other sacrifices that are made to celebrate with you. \n\nYTA but hopefully you can find some perspective on other ways your friends can show respect and gratitude to you that can\u2019t be wrapped in paper.", "40 years is a bit late to learn the old \u201cexpectations are premeditated disappointments\u201d saying but better late than never I guess", "I think it's about what you appreciate from your friends, and what you expect others to appreciate. Honestly getting all those gifts for all those people sounds like a ton of work. And to be honest when friends get me gifts, I'm thankful! But I don't get them gifts often, I'm just not a big gifts person. Often they make me feel a bit uncomfortable because it makes me afraid they expect something from me now, just like you in this post.\n\nWhat I really appreciate in my friends is their willingness to give me their time. Reach out to me every so often, ask how I'm doing, meet up regularly, exchange information on our lives, experiences, and share emotions. I really, really appreciate people spending time with me regularly, especially over years.\n\nYou just can't expect others to want the same things as you, or know what you want to receive. If what you're doing is feeling like too much to the point where you're getting resentful, you need to reexamine where you're spending your efforts and where you're getting the returns you want, and focus on that. Scolding your friends was wrong, because they didn't do anything wrong, it just sound alike you've been doing too much and have misplaced expectations.", "Very childish to expect adult non family members to buy you presents. Was the party at chuck e cheeses or casa bonita?", "Hey OP, just wanted to say how nice it is to see someone really engage and consider the view that is critical of their actions without being combative and defensive. Even if you end up disagreeing and conclude you're NTA, the fact that you're taking the feedback in so respectfully is really cool.", "It's difficult to see past it at first but it's a universal truth! I always say if you want to make the effort, make sure you realise it will always be one sided (to stop expectations) or start doing less for others.", "You don't bring a bottle of wine to a licenced venue.", "I showed up to one last week with no gift. It was a much smaller party, there was only 4 of us, and no one brought gifts because that\u2019s legitimately not expected at adult birthdays in my circle.", "Ok, that\u2019s worse. I assumed you were drunk and decided to bring it up while it was relevant. Not still be in a hissy for weeks later! My god, grow up", "Exactly. I wouldn\u2019t even go empty handed to a friend who invites me to dinner to their house. I\u2019d bring a bottle of wine or dessert at least. I\u2019m shocked at the number of people claiming gifts are \u2018optional\u2019. Sure, no one is forcing you but it\u2019s the polite thing to do when someone is hosting.", "That\u2019s not \u201cHow you are\u201d. It\u2019s who you\u2019re choosing to be. Bite back? You literally typed \u201cNu uhhh\u201d. That\u2019s extremely childish, disrespectful and rude! You keep saying that \u201cYou are learning\u201d. But. What exactly are you learning?", "Which is what makes YTA", "They took the time and made the effort to attend your party. \n\nI do not expect gifts as an adult. I never have. Unless I\u2019m attending a wedding or shower of some kind, it\u2019s just not an expectation. I usually pick up something, particularly if my friends are hosting at their home. Then I\u2019ll get a host/hostess gift.\n\nI get being upset and as someone who is pretty sensitive and often feels like I put more care and thought into my relationships I feel for you. But you know what I\u2019d do? Talk to my husband or best friend to vent, then let it go like an adult. No matter how you argue this, getting into a confrontation about birthday gifts with folks is immature, ESPECIALLY at your age. \n\nYou need to learn to regulate your expectations and emotions appropriately. Feel hurt after venting? Then make decisions about those relationships moving forward and adjust accordingly. This is how adults deal with these sorts of conflicts\u2026they don\u2019t just pick fights. MAYBE if a friend that hurt me brought up the topic of the party, I\u2019d look for an opening to gently discuss my feelings but again, that would be based on the natural flow of conversation.", "You only live once, and it is not long enough to put up with people not treating you like you deserve. But it is equally not long enough to fill it with resentment against things you can't control. If you don't like people, and you don't like their attitude then fuck them and ignore them. You're old enough and seemingly have enough friends that you can drop the ones you don't like. \n\nThe key to a good life isn't an abundance of joy and pleasure, it's a lack of negativity, problems, and drama. \n\nJust ignore toxicity and spend time with the people you like. There's literally no point spending time with people you don't like or hold resentment towards. It's just a recipe for problems and honestly, it makes you a bitter person. When you spend time with people you don't like, or resent, or don't enjoy being around - it shapes your mind, which shapes how you feel. The more time you spend with these people, you're essentially training your mind to be more and more bitter, by constantly exposing it to negative thoughts and problems, and then you get better and find it easier and easier to spot problems in the friends you actually like.", "It's never too late to learn.", "Well you haven't read my many posts to those who have called me the asshole and where I've taken it on board. Thanks.", "I disagree.", "It's ok. I'm confident enough in my self to know when to take something on board and when not to. That's my right and you can go fuck off if you say I can't disagree with someones comments. Seriously?", "Have just done. I understand.", "Right? I had to stop and just dig into the guy, and he's still just like nuh unhhhhhh", "Ok, stay classy.", "Don't think so.", "Thanks broseph.", "Yep pretty sure. That's what my drivers licence says.", "Nope not at all, but I also don't expect you to understand my life based on one post.", "I'm not in America. I'm in Australia where we have class ;)", "Ok, I don't know your rules. So you cannot bring a bottle of wine in a gift bag or you don't drink the wine in a licensed venue?", "But in my circle nobody shows up empty handed. And OP's friends certainly know that since they have no problem accepting gifts from OP. \n\nSo now OP knows he shouldn't give them gifts for their birthdays from now on because 'they don't do gifts'.", "It\u2019s the polite thing to do but personally I\u2019d rather a friend of mine show up without a gift than feel like they couldn\u2019t come.  And if they did come without a gift, I wouldn\u2019t give them a hard time in public.  If it was a pattern of showing up without contributing, maybe I\u2019d address it in private.  But not like this\u2026", "My partner won\u2019t even go to my fathers for dinner without a bottle of wine, and neither of us really drink, but my father does. I think for me it\u2019s a respect thing. I think if the roles were reversed these people may have a very different opinion.", "I\u2019m pretty sure OP was expecting more than a bottle of wine as a gift. But I agree. A host/hostess gift is always appropriate.", "I'm learning not to take life so seriously. Lighten up.", "How so?", "Yes but given ur age it might have better if it was sooner", "Old dog. Hard to teach a grown child that refuses to acceot accountability for their behaviour. As well, it is not Reddit's job to treat your poorly attempted middle age growth.\n\nYou wanna grow? So grow. Just fuck off before you do it tho. Fuck it rite.", "You sure you\u2019re 40? You sound like a child", "You came here for judgment, and it's clearly not going the way you wanted. I'm sorry (not really) that you're upset by this, but....seriously, you came to be judged. I'd tell you to take your judgment like an adult, but clearly that's not going to happen since you can't even deal with not getting birthday gifts. Grow up, then you can have parties again", "Nuh unhhhh", "Most licensed venues aren't keen on people bringing alcohol in. I would bring wine if it was a house party.", "Absolutely. That seems like a good solution to me.", "Yes I agree with you. It\u2019s not something that needed addressing, let alone with confrontation. He could have just not bought them a gift next time and call it a day.", "Why? I've accomplished a lot in this life already. Run a successful company with 40 employees, happily married with three kids. But yeh it took a lot of therapy to get me to the point of confronting my serious insecurities. \n\n\nI assume you're perfect?", "That's why Reddit is so ridiculous sometines. I'm getting downvoted whilst actually admitting that I've overeacted and trying to learn from it. I'm 40 and still trying to learn. I can't say the same for many of my 40 year peers stuck in their ways. Reddit is weird.", "Huh??", "Yeh def 40.", "Thanks", "Thanks for clarifying this!", "Grow up, you\u2019re throwing a tantrum over the internet when no one sided with you throwing a tantrum because you didn\u2019t get a present on your 40th birthday. YTA.", "Dude, this is incredibly embarrassing. You\u2019re a grown man. Get a grip.", "You\u2019re admitting you\u2019ve overreacted but also being combative and a bit rude. People tend to downvote everything when you behave like an AH in the comments. Which you are. It\u2019s a weird mix of humility and also being a jerk. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My guy. You say you're direct, yet you're the complete fucking opposite. At least mean what you say, fuck dude.\n\nGrowing is good. But don't bullshit at 40. Don't be dishonest about your inability to be truly direct. And if you don't know what being direct actually is, it implies an immediate, straightforward confrontation.\n\nNot \"letting it stew for two weeks.\" Not telling people to track down your reddit history just to save you the time it takes to edit a post. Straightforward. Right to the point, little hesitation beyond understanding the sitation as it's unfolding.\n\nAgain. I'm 28. I am this way. I dont exoect jack shit on my birthday from friends. From my direct family, sure, maybe if money is good. But from friends? Nah.\n\nAnyways, I hope you edit your post. Don't stop learning.

You came here and are acting out again because everyone on AITA is acting\u2026pretty normal for this sub. \n\nYou\u2019re 40. Is this who and how you want to be? If so, then own it and don\u2019t come here asking for judgement. Or choose to find a way to be both assertive and humble/graceful.

I'm learning a lot tonight.", "What do you mean by editing my post? I don't know what I'd edit it for? I'm genuinely asking.", "No I didn't actually. But I can see you have a lot to add to the discussion. Well done", "You're totally right. The pendulum has certainly swung the other way with a lot of hurt pushing it. I'm working on that.
