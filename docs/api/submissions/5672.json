I invited 30 of my closest friends and family and we booked out a function room in a restaurant. The whole night including drinks was on me. My wife and I are not that well off but we saved up all year for this. The night cost us $4500 which was food, drinks, cocktails etc at a very nice restaurant. \n\nOf the 30 guests, 10 of them didn't buy me a present. This would bother 95% of us I assume. Normally I wouldn't say anything as I've avoided confrontation my whole life but this last year or two I've kinda adopted the \"fuck it\" attitude and am more direct with communicating my feelings. I stewed on it for two weeks but then confronted those friends (keep in mind I've always bought my friends gifts whether they have parties or not). Most of them got awkward and said a present was coming. But a couple of them thought I was rude and entitled for bringing it up. I particularly cracked it one of them as they were rude to me about it and I bloody spent $150 a head on her and her partner which is something she would never do. She earns three time what I earn but is a Scrooge. \n\nAnyway. Am I ok for confronting this or am I an entitled asshole??\n\nEdit: Just to clarify..I'm a Sri Lankan  guy in Australia. Both Sri Lankan and Australian cultures have a social etiquette where gift giving remains very normal into your adulthood. Especially if the persons event your attending has given a gift to you previously.

I invited 30 of my closest friends and family and we booked out a function room in a restaurant. The whole night including drinks was on me. My wife and I are not that well off but we saved up all year for this. The night cost us $4500 which was food, drinks, cocktails etc at a very nice restaurant. \n\nOf the 30 guests, 10 of them didn't buy me a present. This would bother 95% of us I assume. Normally I wouldn't say anything as I've avoided confrontation my whole life but this last year or two I've kinda adopted the \"fuck it\" attitude and am more direct with communicating my feelings. I stewed on it for two weeks but then confronted those friends (keep in mind I've always bought my friends gifts whether they have parties or not). Most of them got awkward and said a present was coming. But a couple of them thought I was rude and entitled for bringing it up. I particularly cracked it one of them as they were rude to me about it and I bloody spent $150 a head on her and her partner which is something she would never do. She earns three time what I earn but is a Scrooge. \n\nAnyway. Am I ok for confronting this or am I an entitled asshole??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If someone invites me, spend money to feed me and and drink me, the least I can do is a little token. \n\nI sent gift even when my finances were horrible and I had to made them with my own hands.\nBtw, happy Christmas Scrooge", "Why though? Even a $10 candle is a nice gesture. It's not like I had a couple of mates over for some Doritos and a beer. It was a 40th. Biggest party of my life. That warrants a gift no?", "Ha!", "Um normal people.", "Definitely 40. Not sure a 4 year old could type this.", "Haha brilliant. Thanks for the laugh.", "Wow, takes one to know one.", "Or ever", "Hell yeh I do. It's my love language. Nothing wrong with that at all.", "I'm here to learn. Which is exactly what I'm doing. I'm seeing how I've overreacted to things and to not have the same expectations on friends. I'm ok with it.", "I ain't sad. Happy that I had a great night. Just confronted some shit behaviour from friends I've done a lot for. Overzealous? Yep probably and I'll learn from it.", "My 50th will be awesome. Already got it planned out.", "Sounds like cultural differences too. Being Sri Lankan we are drilled to always bring gifts.no matter what value. I still remember my Dad cracking the shits when I only gave $50 to a distant cousins wedding. I have high expectations based on that and I'm still learning on what to expect in return.", "Thanks for the advice. My temper gets the better of me every now and then. Lifes a journey and I'm still learning.", "Thanks.", "True. But I won't stop giving based on others giving or not. It jsut hurt a little and I'm allowed to feel that way.", "Thank you for your comment. You're a very gracious person.", "Good point. I just read the rules. I'll take that on board.", "I might push back on the idea of gifts being universally traditional. As adults, my friends and I have never exchanged birthday gifts. It would seem strange to do so. When my elementary age kids receive birthday party invitations the invite almost always specifies \u201cno gifts\u201d so, even for them, taking a gift to a party is not the norm.", "I am grateful they turned up. It was a great night.", "That's cool. Sounds like you're in a great place. I hope to learn from this experience and have an attitude more like yours in the future.", "I've got lots of great friends. We had a great night. I have def overreacted when it came to a few of those who I'm realising are just free loaders. Thanks for your opinion.", "Really good point. No card. \n\nAny it's also worth pointing out the same people who didn't get gifts were also the same who didn't thank me for the dinner. \n.just shows me some people are just takers.", "I spent that much as it's my favourite restaurant and wanted to share it with my closest friends and family.", "Thank you. I'm realising that not everyone has the same expectations on gift giving for different reasons. I was raised to never ever go to someone else's event, dinner party, birthday empty handed. It might be a bit old school but that's how I was raised.", "This! He had 30 people celebrate with him and doesn\u2019t appreciate any of it", "Depends on culture I guess. Being Sri Lankan it's a status thing too.", "Read my comments on this post. I posted so I could genuinely get some feedback. I'd say 90% of comments here say IATA and I'm taking that on board. Don't be embarrassed for me though. I can take it.", "Nah I'm 40. It says so in the post.", "Not true at all. But I don't expect you to understand just by one post.", "Exactly. Thank you.", "Yep. Not so for your average Redditor however.", "Exactly, thank you. Yes the badgering I'm not proud of. It was an emotional response and something I'll learn from.", "Yes graceful isn't my forte at the moment. I'm a bit blunt.", "Because I wanted to..simple as that. I wanted to be generous.", "I disagree. My friendship group of blokes certainly do and we love it. It's personal and we bond over the gifts. It's cool if your friendship group don't but it's a bit naive yo simply state dudes our age don't do gifts.", "Thanks. I didn't spend that much with the intention of getting that in return. Its just that I would never rock up to a 40th without a gift whether it was a $50 picnic or a $20000 lavish dinner.", "So the guests should have known the dollar amount OP was spending ahead of time? If OP wanted to make it transactional, he could have included that on the invitation. Most birthday parties for people over the age of about 12 don't 'require' a birthday present. Should OP have listed a minimum dollar amount for the gift too?", "Why though? Because then I'm lowering my standards to suit them. That would truly make me the asshole. I'll keep giving thanks.", "I don't. I give regardless. Am I not allowed to say on the one event that is actually for me it hurt a little to not have people return the favour?", "Lol. You know shit about me.", "Where did I state that was the purpose to my party? You're making assumptions which makes you the asshole.", "They're my close friends. I know what's going on in their lives. I wouldn't care if it were a once off. But it's a pattern.", "Well I think you know the answer to that lol", "I like it. I don't have a problem being the one reminding them either.", "Hehe clever. I like it. Good points though. Much appreciated.", "Translation: \"my feewings were hurt, ergo you're wrong\"", "Why bother posting on AITA if you\u2019re going to argue with the judgement and be rude to people replying?", "Than why come and ask if you\u2019re an asshole if you\u2019re going to argue that you\u2019re not? \n\nYTA", "You: Am I an asshole for being self entitled and making sure my friends knew how self entitled I was two weeks after the fact?(not direct in any regard btw)\n\nReddit: Yes, YTA\n\nYou, again, for some reason: nuh unh", "Don\u2019t be surprised when they don\u2019t bother showing up to your 41st.

This comment is much less exaggerated then your post. Plus that phrase makes no sense \u201cyour exaggerated response lost me\u201d so you got lost understanding after more then 2 sentences? That explains why the concept of you being the YTA in this situation is also lost to you", "What part of that was exaggerated? It's spot on", "you came in here asking if you\u2019re the asshole then you get mad when people tell you that you are an asshole?\n\nmaybe you should start to reflect on how you treat others rather than saying whatever you want to say", "Yes when you're an adult there's no expectation for gifts at birthdays and Christmas, even if you organize the party. It's always nice to get a gift but to demand it it's just crass. Just be grateful for their company.", "Oh, yes please! I always heavily celebrate myself for my birthday, yet I have never, EVER thrown a party with the incentive of receiving presents, and am always happily surprised if I get some...", "Are you a Hobbit?", "This is how I feel about my Birthday.  I buy everyone in the office lunch.  I don\u2019t need a gift.", "As an adult I don't expect my friends to bring a gift when I've had birthday parties. The last time I expected everyone to turn up to my birthday party with a gift I was 12.", "Yes always bring gifts to childrens parties.\n\nThis dude is a mega asshole.", "You\u2019ve avoided confrontation your whole life and this is where you choose to start?", "Sorry, but tantrum is the word. Look, communication isn't always necessary, and there is very little point in scolding people for not doing something they should have done out of love for you. I understand your disappointment, but standing up for yourself in this case shouldn't be by confronting them, but by noting their ingratitude and re-examining the friendship. If this was one-off thoughtlessness on their part, but they are supportive and good friends otherwise, let it go. If they are generally selfish and your friendship is you giving and them taking, distance yourself from them. Personally, I don't even bother cutting such people off, I just relegate them to friendly aquaintances; if they mind the distance, they can do the work to be better friends/", "Lol. You \u201corganize ahead with your wife\u201d. So\u2026your wife is actually the one doing the emotional and physical labor in this ridiculous gifting scheme. Now you\u2019re a double asshole.\n\nAlso, you have decided to be a more direct communicator at 40. Note that communication happens in the beginning when you set expectations, not just the end when you are disappointed Communication after the fact is just whinging. If you expected this to be transactional you should have noted that on the invitation. \n\nYou sound insufferable. YTA", "Then of you are that generous I can see why you are disappointed. However you are on one extreme of the generosity scale and maybe invest too much in that.\n\nMaybe review the relationships you have and concentrate on those that you feel are reciprocal. \n\nI will amend my judgement. Only YTA for the outburst. But take a step back and ensure you don't put yourself in a position to be disappointed again. \n\nHappy 40th btw. Life begins...", "Again ridiculous", "It\u2019s not generous if you\u2019re expecting gifts back, generous is doing it without strings attached. Your standards are not universal", "Don't expect other people to have the exact set of standards you have. This is the main cause of misunderstandings, resentment and infighting. The sooner you understand that everyone is different and effort looks different for everyone, the better off you'll be. You're hurting yourself here with your expectations.", "They showed up to your party. That\u2019s caring at all.\n\nYou decided to be more confrontation and you picked the wrong fight \n\nThis kinda none-sense would end my friendship with you", "You seem to expect your relationships to be transactional. You give others something, you expect something in return. For a lot of people, that's very uncomfortable - I'd rather receive nothing at all than be given things with unspoken expectations. You didn't even give your friends the opportunity to turn down this transaction, you assumed it was expected without even informing them. That's why you're getting such a negative reaction.", "Spending their evening with you is caring. Caring does not need to be in material form.", "Because most people are not putting this much thought in receiving a gift \ud83d\ude02", "But you'll confront people for not bringing one, which is just as audacious, if not more so. It's not only entitled, it adds in passive aggressive.", "But still you expected it....   these ppl already gifted you their time.", "Because adults don\u2019t typically require gifts in exchange for attendance at parties. I haven\u2019t given birthday gifts as an adult at all. My friends and I have an agreement that we spend money on experiences together rather than presents. We also randomly gift one another stuff when we\u2019re thinking of each other.\n\nIt\u2019s only thoughtful and generous when it\u2019s not required or expected (thats a transactional relationship).", "Well, there\u2019s your problem.\n\nI do not buy any adult gifts out of an obligation. Not for birthdays, not for Christmas, nothing. If I see something that makes me think of someone, I will buy it for them and give it them whenever. Personally I think spontaneous gifts matter way, way more than \u201cugh I had to buy you something so here, have a candle\u201d. Personally I think gift giving is stupid when it\u2019s an obligation. Why am I spending $50 on something you won\u2019t want, and come my birthday you are spending $50 on something I won\u2019t want, when instead we could each just spend that money on something we actually want.\n\nAll this is, I\u2019m pretty sure, is cultures clashing. It\u2019s perfectly okay to place a bigger emphasis on gifts, but if they matter to you you need to tell people. Because if I was invited to your birthday, I would be: 1, expecting to pay for my own drinks, and 2, not aware that a gift was so important to you. If you were just disappointed, this would be N A H, but confronting them after changes it to YTA.\n\nThis boils down to: tell people your expectations! Don\u2019t expect them to read your mind! You\u2019re not a child anymore, unless specified gifts are optional.", "It\u2019s significantly worse to throw a tantrum at your party over presents not being given, then to request it at the outset.", "Then how do you expect people to know they must bring a gift or you'll confront them like you did?", "Exactly. Think about why that is \u2013 because it would be extraordinarily rude to expect a gift.", "Yet that\u2019s exactly how you felt", "No, I just find it hysterical. I truly am sorry about the legos. Or lack there of.", "Bruh, don\u2019t ask for peoples opinions on reddit and then get pissy when you don\u2019t get the answer you want - I\u2019m half your age and can\u2019t imagine throwing my toys out of the cot when people don\u2019t bring me a gift. Get over yourself lol", "Personally, I'd bring my friends some consumable they'd like for their birthday parties (usually some kind of booze), but I wouldn't expect them to bring anything for mine.\n\nWeddings are different and a gift is definitely expected there.\n\nEdit to add: Though if a friend is having their party out at a pub/restaurant, I'd probably turn up with a card and make sure they eat/drink for free that night instead of bringing a gift since I'd assume they wouldn't want to carry a bunch of stuff around with them.", "This is the best comment here. If you\u2019re invited to a party or event where someone else is paying, the polite thing to do is bring a gift or invite them next time. If I\u2019m invited and go to a wedding with a +1, the gift value I\u2019d bring would be reflective of that as the hosts are paying for two of us to be there. \n\nYour friends who didn\u2019t buy gifts clearly aren\u2019t very well mannered. Having said that, just make a mental note and don\u2019t put much effort in for them next time. Your reaction was unnecessary and childish. \n\nI\u2019m going with ESH.", "No please dont stop with this but spread it. The whole mandatory gift thing because of social norms make me sick. its all about the money nowadays. We have to buy gift for people that already have everything they want... Just because they decide they want to host a party.", "Absolutely not.  Anyone who needs appreciation expressed through a trinket rather than a sincere thank you should please feel free to say so loudly so the rest of us can avoid their materialistic nonsense.", "Fuck accepted social customs. Society fucking sucks. People don't deserve a gift just because they were born. You have to earn that by not being a shitty human, like OP was.", "See I'd rather have all my closest together for a night, expectation free, then 30 pointless gifts that will clutter my house. \nPeople are different, you see giving gifts as a gesture of love or appreciation. I see the effort in attending and being there for me is worth more than anything. Life is hard and I rarely get to see my loved ones together so I cherish when they are in one place.", "Looks like you didn\u2019t even appreciate them being there. Only if they had a gift then youd be grateful. \n\nGiven your respones and the fact you are still defending your point after asking if YTA you\u2019d probably still be behaving like this if they got you a candle.", "Yeah, like you wouldn\u2019t have come here and been like \u201cAITA for being mad my friend only got me a candle for my party\u201d", "The gift is that they made time to attend your party and celebrate with you. Life is bussy wen you are older, especially if you have kids and you have to arrange babysitting, or sitter for pets, taking off time from work or travel to the party.

I have had events and parties and have never expected anyone to bring me something. If they do it\u2019s a bonus as I invite them as I want to have their company. However I do think it is good manners to bring a host something as a thank you. \n\nIt\u2019s the same as Christmas/birthdays. I buy gifts as I *want* to give them something. I enjoy the process of choosing something I think they would like, but I don\u2019t expect them to get me anything in return as I don\u2019t necessarily know what their finances are (just because someone has a good job doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not something else going on you don\u2019t know about that could have a strain on their finances). \n\n\nI would never dream of confronting someone like you did as to me that\u2019s just as rude as not bringing even a token gift.

I know, because I genuinely give regardless and I genuinely do not care if people return because I won't be influenced by other people's decisions and actions. I will *actually* give regardless of whether they give or not - I've already accepted that they won't before I give, but I do it anyway because I'm genuinely not doing it with any expectation for reciprocation.

Hence why I put so much effort into it for others and also why it hurts when it's not reciporctaed.

I've had a fairly rough life (not looking for sympathy) and I've fonally come to a point in life where everything is what I consider healthy. I'm married, got three amazing kids, run a business, have great friends and family and I love doing lots for people. I have noticed some friends not really putting any effort into the friendship and also with heir other friends and it's being feeling one sided for a while. The one friend who I confronted is particularly difficult at the moment as they are very well off and trying to be a life of status and therefore pushing certain friendships away. But it hurts me that whisky they're building their new pool and putting kids through elite private schools that they would come to my party and not even give a card or anything when they know how much effort I go to.

Yes, I agree there is a social custom to bring a gift to a wedding, a party, etc. But if I choose to have my wedding a place that is $250 a plate, I don't think it is fair to expect couples to gift me $500. That's unreasonable IMO.\n\nHeck when I was married years back, it was $75/head. We invited an elderly cousin of mine and her husband who I knew lived on next to nothing.

And also that if there is an understanding between your social group that you don't do gifts, that a different matter! Neither case changes that people are generally expected to bring gifts to birthday parties.\nI have been broke in my life. Because I have not been raised to believe not having money is shameful, I have been open about it and explained that I can't bring a gift or contribute because of finances, and people were always understanding about it. What I haven't done is pretend gift giving is not the custom or that people who expect them are unreasonable and materialistic."]}
