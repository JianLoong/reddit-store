Sadly quite a few people in my life have gotten COVID in the past few weeks including my mom, coworkers, and my boyfriend\u2019s whole family. After Luna told me she got COVID, I checked in and we had normal conversations for a few days up until Thursday night. I then got very busy with work and I didn\u2019t hear from Luna and didn\u2019t want to disturb her as I imagined she would be tired and need rest. \n\nShe reached out Monday (3 days since we last spoke) to let me know she just left the hospital and was there for a few days due to severe COVID symptoms. \n\nI tried calling her but she didn\u2019t answer which I respected. I texted her how sorry I was to hear, asked her some questions, and inquired how I can support her. I apologized for not knowing, and she mentioned a couple of times how surprised she was that she hadn\u2019t heard from me. I apologized for not reaching out and explained that I didn\u2019t want to bother her while she was getting rest and assumed she would reach out if she needed anything. I also apologized for misunderstanding how severe her COVID was, as she seemed completely like herself unlike my mom when she had COVID. I said I wish I had been there for her, but I am here now. Over the course of all the messages, she has compared me to her other friends saying that I\u2019m the only one who didn\u2019t reach out those 3 days. \n\nI\u2019m a bit hurt regarding the pressure. After years of putting effort into our friendship, the one time I don\u2019t reach out for a few days I\u2019m made to feel like I\u2019m not a good friend. While it hurts, I also want to respect the fact that this must have been a scary few days for her and I feel very badly that I wasn\u2019t there for her or aware of what was happening.\n\nShe has said \u201cno worries\u201d a few times, but has also said many times how I\u2019m the only one who hadn\u2019t reached out, how surprised/hurt she is, how she expected to hear from me, that this has been the closest she has been to death, that I\u2019ve always messaged her in the past when she was sick, and much more. \n\nWhile I have been expressing worry the entire conversation, apologizing for not reaching out for a few days, and clearly showing my care and concern for her, she has been responding by saying it\u2019s fine because she \u201ccan\u2019t expect me to worry about her\u201d. \n\nI told her I have been worried, and I don\u2019t want my lack of reaching out to be mistaken for a lack of care about her. I let her know I\u2019m feeling a bit unheard in this conversation and definitely guilted, but I understand that she has been through a very scary few days and to let me know if there\u2019s any way I can help or any way I can support her. She then said she isn\u2019t guilting me at all and used the fact that she said \u201cno worries\u201d as evidence how she\u2019s not guilting me.\n\nTl;dr - I knew my best friend had COVID but misjudged the severity. I checked in for a few days after finding out and then didn\u2019t message for a few days to not interrupt her rest. She was in the hospital due to her symptoms which I wasn\u2019t aware of and has brought up multiple times how surprised/hurt she is that I didn\u2019t contact her for those three days and that I\u2019m her only friend that didn\u2019t.", "created_utc": 1667287405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj1wq5/aita_for_not_reaching_out_to_my_best_friend_while/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I understand why she feels hurt if you \"speak most days,\" and of course it was a difficult time for her. That said, not messaging for a few days, especially while dealing with a lot of other people in your life, your mom being sick, etc., is not an AH thing. You had no reason to suspect that she was in the hospital, and she was capable of telling you that--if she could receive your message, she could send a message with her news. It does in fact go both ways.\n\nI hope she gets past her hurt, stops trying to guilt you (and yes she is guilting you in the subsequent conversation, and then trying to gaslight you that she's not), and you both move forward.", "NTA. You cant \u201csmell\u201d\nOver the phone how bad COVID is. I was actually in Luna\u2019s position a few weeks ago, having severe COVID. I sure as hell dont blame my best friend. I know her very well, and i know if i had called her amd told her how severe it was she would come running to help. Restrictions be damned. So i need not compare her to others. And i think its mean to do that. Especially after you apologized so many times", "NTA, I hate to downplay any illness but Covid is everywhere, she should have been more specific as to how bad it was because symptoms and experiences vary SO much. I\u2019ve been in hospital due to it myself and let everyone know that would want to, she could have done this, it seems like you would fall into the \u201clet them know category.\u201d \n\nShe cannot put all her eggs in your basket no matter how good of friends you are, that\u2019s way too much pressure. \n\nIt sounds like you apologised and did everything you could to show support and love when you found out. I\u2019m sure she has had a scary and vulnerable experience and is reacting based on that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She could have sent you a message 'things are not going well. Have to go to the hospital'. She didn't. You left her alone because of being busy and giving her time to rest. \nI can imagine she was disappointed, but you bent over backwards to apologize. I guess it is up to her now to get over it or not. Stop apologizing and stop bringing it up. Focus on the now (like you did by asking her what you can do for her now).\n\nI hope she completely recovers. COVID sucks!", "YTA. You could have at least texted her.", "So why didn't her friend just text if she wanted to talk so badly? OP didn't want to bother them and let them rest. Using other people's reaching out as proof of somehow not caring is such crappy behavior and instead of just saying she was hurt and had wanted OP to initiate she is making OP feel awful.\n\nI hate this expectation that one must constantly check in, yet it's on one person and not both. If you as an adult want to hear from someone and haven't you message them, don't wait and then be mad they didn't. People get busy and I for one try not to bug people if they say they are sick and need rest.\n\nOp is def NTA, friend on the other hand using other people's behavior as a way to scold or shame OP Is childish.", "NTA", "I'm gonna go with NTA.\n\nI understand your friend being hurt by you not reaching out, and you understood that as well and apologized. \nYou made an honest mistake in my opinion and were very mature about it afterwards.\nTry to keep being supportive as you are good friends, but your friend also shouldn't keep holding this over your head.", "NAH.

NTA", "NTA but your friend is for trying to make you feel guilty. There was no way for you to know that she got so bad, and 3 days is not a long time.  Plus I had covid last year, about as bad as it gets (it lasted over a month) but I still texted my friend who came over to help me.  She was not helpless...", "NTA\n\nI hate it when friends try and test others...ffs all she needed to do was text and say she was off to hospital.\n\nYou also have a life at those couple of days were busy and you (quite reasonably) assumed that she was resting/sleeping it off.", ">So why didn't her friend just text if she wanted to talk so badly? \n\nIt was her who was sick! And no, there's no expectation that \"one must constantly check in\", she contracted a potentially deadly virus, so I'd guess if OP cared for her, she would check if she's all right and if she needs anything."]}
