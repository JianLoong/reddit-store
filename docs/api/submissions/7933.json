If she wanted to be openly acknowledged for important life (and death) events, then perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have taken the role of the secret side-piece. And the cardinal rule of that role, to which she assigned herself, is to remain secret. Unfortunately your husband is gone now, leaving his loved ones to deal with the pain his actions, along with his side-piece, has wrought. She\u2019s had her time with him. The decent thing would have been to at least allow his family, you and your kids, to mourn his passing in peace, instead of making the day about her.

This isn't a simple situation. Had it been a shorter affair, no question the other woman was 100% in the wrong. Being a lengthy one changes the dynamic a bit.", "[removed]", "NTA, her need to grieve doesn't come above his kids, the younger 2 already dealing with life shattering loss without them having his affair exposed, and then destroying all they have left of him - his memory.", "NTA\n\nYou are not selfish at all.

If he wanted her to be a major part of his life he would've made her one publicly.", "The problem is he lied for five years to maintain his relationship with her. To learn your husband has been lying for five years undermines a lot of trust on top of grieving his loss (which happened because he was going to see You Know Who). OP is being remarkably calm and composed given the context.", "Both the husband and affair partner made a decision that they were going to have a relationship knowing that relationship would cause pain and suffering to an innocent person/family at some point. They did not care and were willing to take that risk. So since they got away with it for so long that gives the affair partner some rights now? Hell no! Everything they had was built on lies and deceit that ended in an innocent person and her son now dealing with complicated grief.

You did nothing wrong, you were looking out for your children. Block her number and continue your healing. She is selfish.", "NTA ROTFLMAO!

Because I would have made sure she didn't know where it was.", "NTA. Everything that is taken into an affair is stolen from others. The time, the intimacy, the affection, the emotions. They stole all of these things and more from OP and her children. Now it has also stolen any future they have with the husband and father they knew.

About not upsetting them. And that if she can't respect that, you'll have her forcibly removed before she can get inside. \n\nAlert the funeral home with her picture and let them know she isn't allowed in. And maybe have any large and intimidating friends posted at the front door to stop her in case she tries.", "NTA. That's the deal she made when she knowingly enabled your husband to betray his family. She's not entitled to anything that is entitled to his family. She robbed herself of a decent relationship by tying herself to a man who doesn't care about family. That's a decision she made for herself.\n\nBut forget about her. As you said, you have your kids to worry about. Their father got killed while betraying his family. That's a lot to deal with. And unfortunately it falls on you to clean up his mess and make sure your kids are able to navigate this.\n\nHis affair partner's desires should never *ever* compete with what your kids need. I know there's a lot going on right now--a lot to process. But you can always stand firm in putting your kids first.", "NTA, and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, as well as the betrayal. That\u2019s a lot to process all at once, for you and your son. She was incredibly out of line to not only contact you, but to show up. She is the one being selfish, and it\u2019s abundantly clear she lacks any sense of morality, empathy or even emotional intelligence. \n\nDo not let anything she says get to you, she\u2019s not worth the headspace. It may help to block her and get in to therapy to help process everything.", "NTA. I am sorry that you have to deal with this on top of everything else. \n\nYou putting your kids and yourself first is the right thing to do. She has no right to demand anything from you. Sure she is grieving too, but that is for her to deal with and not your burden to share at all.", "NTA it was a private ceremony and she wasn't invited. Doesn't matter if she loved him or not. Edit to add: the asshole move would be to point her out and tell everyone it's HER fault he's dead because without her messing with a married man he'd be safe at home with family. And encourage everyone to boo, hiss and spit. That would have been asshole-ish. But you kept it classy", "Holy actual shit.\n\nNTA\n\nThe cruelty of this woman is staggering. She has no decency. Yes, she is grieving, but you owe her nothing. *Nothing*. If she had a shred of dignity she would keep her distance and only contact you to offer a conversation on your terms if you ever want it for the sake of closure. To actually muscle in on your husband's funeral, *with his kids there*, is so disgusting I can't believe it, let alone having the nerve to text you with insults.\n\nI am so sorry your husband left you with this shit show to handle. I am sorry he betrayed you. I am sorry you found out this way.", "NTA. How disgusting of her to think she deserved to be involved and even worse for her to show her face there. They are really delusional enough to believe they are more than a dirty little secret. So sorry for your loss and that you had to endure this additional hurt.", "NTA. She\u2019s the selfish one for planning on putting your kids and you through having to deal with her at their father and your husband\u2019s funeral. She\u2019s entitled to nothing! That\u2019s what your entitled to if your the AP! You have no right over the family of getting to say good bye or having anything from him.

You are entirely justified in your feelings and actions. Don\u2019t engage her anymore. Block if you have to.  If she contacts you, have a lawyer send a cease and desist letter.
