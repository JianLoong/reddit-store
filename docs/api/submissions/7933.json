An AP is less than in the hierarchy in this situation, they have no legal or moral rights, that's what one accepts when they are the AP.  The term side piece exists for a reason, when u are an AP u are on the outside.", "NTA. I am so sorry for everything that has happened. She sounds like a real piece of work. You absolutely didn't have to invite her. She can mourn in her own way, away from you and your grieving children. You did the right thing. Don't let her manipulate you.", "NTA- by accepting her attendance and allowing her to be part of the service would be telling the world and your kids you accepted your husband\u2019s betrayal of his with and family.\n\nHe kept her secret for a reason and that reason was he was didn\u2019t consider her valuable enough to change his home life to be with her. \n\nYou should remind her of her worth to your husband. If he truly wanted her to be more than entertainment he would\u2019ve left his family for her.", "She shouldn't be allowed near the event at all!\n\nNTA", "NTA.  He would be alive if he wasn't off visiting her, so she can get stuffed.  She has no place at your family funeral.  She is not family.  She can say goodbye by herself some other time.", "NTA\n\nShe was playing around knowingly with a married man who had a family and now she has the nerve to call you the selfish one???\n\nNo sympathy for her, You do what you need to do to protect your kids and family", "This is maybe the most desperate for attention stunt I\u2019ve ever heard of. NTA, OP, in any way. This goes beyond tacky and trashy to crash an affair partner\u2019s funeral where their wife and children are grieving them.", "NTA.\n\nYou were complitly right. She might had loved him, but he keeped her a secret and she was okay with beeing a secret while he was alive. So she should also be in his death. Sorry, but that was not her place to be there. She can visit his grave after. And she can also have a small ceremony by herselfe. Ask a priest to read some texts morning a photo or such things.\n\nJust block her number and try to forget about that person. \n\nSorry for your loss. All the best for you and your children.", "NTA. Fuck her. If you're going to be a side chick, play the role", "NTA. The affair partner has no right attending his funeral. She isn't the wife, OP is. She was the homewrecker and should be apologizing to OP and her family for messing with a married man and causing drama.", "NTA. She had no right to be there.", "Holy shit. I'm sorry you didn't find out while he was alive so you could deal with his lies. The fact that you have no closure because he was gone before you could call him an a*$hole is hard enough. Now you have to deal with her BS like she has a valid claim is crazy. NTA and I'm sorry for your heartbreak and your childrens loss.", "NTA - you handled it as respectfully as you could, it was incredibly selfish of her to show up.", "NTA\n\nThe audacity!", "NTA without a second thought. Wtf! \n\nI hope you find peace. Wishing you the best.", "NTA\n\nShe should be absolutely ashamed of herself. I get she's grieving but so is his family who just lost a husband and father and now also have to deal with the fact that he was unfaithful. If she had any class at all she would stay away. \n\nAnd please for the love of God keep the lawyers close in case she comes knocking claiming she's with child demanding money.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and the upheaval this entire situation has caused you and your family. But I can\u2019t believe the audacity of this person, knowing that you have 3 children to care for and comfort during this time; but the only thing she\u2019s considering is herself. If she wanted to be openly acknowledged for important life (and death) events, then perhaps she shouldn\u2019t have taken the role of the secret side-piece. And the cardinal rule of that role, to which she assigned herself, is to remain secret. Unfortunately your husband is gone now, leaving his loved ones to deal with the pain his actions, along with his side-piece, has wrought. She\u2019s had her time with him. The decent thing would have been to at least allow his family, you and your kids, to mourn his passing in peace, instead of making the day about her. You even questioning your decision at the gravesite is showing her more compassion than she\u2019s afforded you and your family. Definitely NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis is an awful situation and I'm sorry for your loss. Also dealing with the how and why. Complete mind fuck of a situation.\n\nWhile I'm sure she is grieving I don't think she has much grounds to involve herself in the funeral. I assume she said what she said due to her grief and general AH status than as an objective opinion. Yes, she can come by later to say goodbye in secret if she really wants.", "NTA. When your that person involved in the affair like that you have to accept not being involved like this. He dies in a trip to see her and she has the nerve to say you have robbed her. She is the selfish 1 here whilst it takes 2 and your husband was at her fault she should never have got involved with him. Quite correct to say she had no business there, block her number and think no more about her.", "NTA\n\nThis lady needs to know her place. \nShe was a side piece and she needs to stay where she belongs. Your family is grieving. She has no right to destroy that.", "This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade my friend. I hope you find peace.", "NTA.  That AP has a lot of fucking nerve.  I'm sorry for your loss (diminished as it is due to the cheating) and I hope you never have to deal with her again.", "NTA She was not entitled to be there, especially to out the affair publicly when you want to keep it private. Her showing up on the side was a power move to run it in your face, or at best a completely self centered move. If she really needed to say her good byes she could have done so after the funeral was over and no one else was around.", "NTA.\n\nIf she wants to \"say goodbye properly\" she can pay for a memorial service of her own.\n\nHaving an affair with someone who already has a spouse and children has drawbacks. Not being welcome at weddings, funerals, and other family functions is one of them. She can not plausibly claim to be surprised at being asked to leave.", "NTA. It\u2019s not about her. It\u2019s about your kids first and foremost. And you. Shame on her for showing up when you expressly said no. Just how does a mistress properly  say goodbye? Didn\u2019t she do that when he left her place? I feel so badly for you and your eldest. Don\u2019t think for a moment that you were TA.", "NTA\nYou\u2019re not selfish at all", "NTA it's her fault he was on the road that day plus she can visit another.\n\nIdk why you decided to do this tho\n\n>Only the eldest knows about the affair and we all agreed to keep it to ourselves.", "This is one of those tricky situations (yes, it really is) where there isn't a right answer.\n\nNTA for not wanting her there for obvious reasons. I will never deny that. On the flip side, it was a 5 year affair and they built a relationship so she did have a right to say goodbye. That being said, she should have been far more tactful about it and chose a time that wasn't the funeral when the rest of the family was going to be there.\n\nYou weren't selfish for wanting her gone, but you all had a relationship with him.\n\nI know I'll get downvoted on this but I don't care. This isn't a simple situation. Had it been a shorter affair, no question the other woman was 100% in the wrong. Being a lengthy one changes the dynamic a bit.", "[removed]", "NTA, her need to grieve doesn't come above his kids, the younger 2 already dealing with life shattering loss without them having his affair exposed, and then destroying all they have left of him - his memory.", "NTA\n\nYou are not selfish at all. You don't owe this woman a single thing, lease of all upsetting your younger children at their father's funeral. You handled it with more grace than a lot of other people would. \n\nThe fact that this woman would say that to you shows her lack of character. After all she slept with a married man and didn't care about that either.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, and everything else that came as a fallout. I\u2019m sorry she made this time harder for you, that as his dirty secret she felt the right to parade herself infront of all your friends and family. Don\u2019t doubt yourself, he was your husband. Not hers.", "NTA\nShe apparently knew she was having an affair with a married man and father and she is unreasonable expecting anything from you. I'm sorry for what you're going through, this must be a hell of a time.", "So... she pretty much is the reason he died... and she thinks you should be accommodating her? Definitely NTA", "NTA\n\nShe was selfish enough to cause your husband to be on the road that day.\n\nShe can visit his grave any other day.", "I hope one day I get to a place where even the most egregious, disgusting action doesn\u2019t bother me because I\u2019m that full of myself. Actually, no I don\u2019t. Of COURSE you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. \n\n I hope you and your family can find peace.", "NTA. Explaining how she knew your late husband would only open up drama, and the funeral was not at all an appropriate place. If she wants to say goodbye she can, as you suggest to it at his grave. She's not thinking about you, you and your oldest son's emotions grappling with loss and betrayal while trying not to involve your to youngest in the truth.\n\nCondolences and have a big internet hug from me.", "NTA. \n\nShe thinks *you* are the selfish one? Is her head really that far up her ass? \n\nYour children\u2019s need to grieve and say goodbye to *their father* without their father\u2019s *affair partner* looming in the background is far more important than anything she wants. \n\nHow cruel ~~and thoughtless~~ (edit: this wasn\u2019t thoughtless, this was a calculated choice) although I\u2019d expect nothing less from someone who knowingly engages in a years-long affair with a married individual. (FWIW, your husband is equally to blame but this is about her actions).", "NTA sorry for your loss and rest easy this was the right things to do.", "NTA\n\nThough I'd have happily nudged her into the hole and encouraged her to enjoy eternity with him, but I understand that you didn't want to cause a scene.\n\nSeriously though, your husband and the homewrecker caused undue harm to your family. She's owed nothing. Has, in fact, taken far too much from you and your kids already.", "NTA. What an unbelievable thing to do.", "NTA", "NTA. She had no problem adding embarrassment, anger and worry for your kids feelings to your grief, which she is partially responsible for despite not causing the crash herself. She is thinking of nothing but herself.", "NTA But what do you expect from someone having an affair with a married man? You did the right thing by having your brother remove her.", "NTA.  The audacity.  What shamefully selfish person (the AP).", "**NTA**    This is definitely a \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" situation.  Do not engage with her again.", "Nta. You were in the right. Your kids needed you to prioritize them and you did. Besides, her moral calculus is way off if she was having a five year long affair with a married father of three to begin with.", "Absolutely agree!!", "Disagree. This is a very easy NTA.", "I disagree her right to say goodbye should have been done just as their relationship was. Away from his marriage and family.  If he wanted her to be a major part of his life he would've made her one publicly.", "The problem is he lied for five years to maintain his relationship with her. To learn your husband has been lying for five years undermines a lot of trust on top of grieving his loss (which happened because he was going to see You Know Who). OP is being remarkably calm and composed given the context.", "Both the husband and affair partner made a decision that they were going to have a relationship knowing that relationship would cause pain and suffering to an innocent person/family at some point. They did not care and were willing to take that risk. So since they got away with it for so long that gives the affair partner some rights now? Hell no! Everything they had was built on lies and deceit that ended in an innocent person and her son now dealing with complicated grief. Google complicated grief and read about the hell they are going through and will probably go through for a long time. The affair partner agreed to sneak around so she should honor that and stay out of sight.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

These are not the actions of a woman who didn\u2019t know the man she was seeing had a family. She knew. She didn\u2019t care.", "He was going to see her when he was in the fatal accident.
