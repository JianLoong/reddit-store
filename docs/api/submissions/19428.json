What would Judge Judy say? Normally, a person who breaks something is responsible, even if it is an accident. However, the owner had a responsibility to keep that item safe. Leaving it on a baseball field probably negates your liability. However, even if you were found to be responsible for half, the amount would be based on the value of the laptop at that time, and not what it cost new. So how old was it? What was it worth as a used laptop? How did they come up with $800? You certainly aren't fully responsible and probably aren't responsible at all.", "NTA. There was no reason for that laptop to be there. It would be a nice thing to offer some kind of money to help offset the cost but it's really not your problem.", "I think $800 is way too much, but maybe contribute a couple hundred just as an act of good faith? A baseball field is no place for a laptop, so ultimately it's on the other boy.", "NTA - This is the problem with bringing expensive and delicate items to a ball game. Accidents happen. I would suggest you pitch like 200 bucks toward it as a show of peace though, unless you think that this dad might try and sue in small claims and the 200 could be like an \"admission of guilt/acceptance of responsibility\"", "If this was an official practice and the ball was thrown as part of a practice activity, the league has insurance for this. Car windows, dented hoods, even broken laptops should be covered.", "NAH I'm of the opinion you should at least split it, but it's hard to call anyone TA. I think giving absolutely nothing is at least part of the way to AH.", "NTA - this is what lockers are for", "NTA.  They were negligent leaving the laptop there.", "I think even though it was an accident, you should probably contribute to the replacement. I\u2019d say half would be fair", "nta\n\nHe brought a laptop into the line of fire and it got burned.  His fault.", "NTA.... the kid with the laptop brought his computer to  baseball field. thats a risk he took knowing that a baseball could go anywhere.\n\nIf you go to a ball game, you essentially sign a waver understanding the inherant dabgers ofparticipating.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour son caused damage, you wil have to pay for it. Or get sued.", "YTA - doesn't matter. You break it. You buy it.", "NTA. Firmly.", "Homeowner's insurance covers personal liability, such as when your kid accidentally breaks another kid's laptop. Although, your plan could apply a deductible that is equivalent to the cost of a laptop.\n\nDue to the laptop having been left on the ball field, I'd offer to pay only half.\n\nESH", "NTA, because that backpack was in the line of fire. Your son still is the one who broke it, so I think that you should split it. Sending the parents every last penny needed is absurd.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If there's fault, it's on the kid who put his $800 laptop somewhere it could be hit by a baseball.  Every baseball diamond I've ever seen has a backstop that can be used to protect stuff from the ball.", "NTA Your son wasn't being reckless. It's not like he was playing ball in the house and broke your favorite vase ir something- he was playing baseball in a baseball field. If there was no dugout, the other kid's parents should have found another place to store the laptop during practice. Maybe in a locker? Maybe they drop the bag off at home before practice?", "I think we need more information. \n\nWas there a separate area to leave possessions ? Does everyone leave them near the field ?", "Info: does he need it for school? Or can he just do without until he earns enough to replace it? And was it actually his or did it belong to dad & son was using it?\n\nIf he needs it for school, then you should go halvers. If it was actually dad\u2019s then you should pay to replace the whole thing.", "YTA. If you break a car\u2019s windows accidentally you still pay for it. \n\nYour son did not mean to - but he broke someone\u2019s laptop. You can afford it (I\u2019m assuming you won\u2019t end up restricting necessary food, shelter or medical care) you replace it. If you cannot pay it all up front, have a discussion about paying off in instalments - especially if the other family can purchase the laptop up front. \n\nThis is also a good reminder to maybe change where things are stored during practice. A safety fence or storage bin would likely have been cheaper.", "NTA but u should at least pay half", "This is pretty much exactly what she would say!", "Also one could say it's the other boys fault for not catching the ball! NTA. The laptop shouldn't have been there.", "The problem with that though it sets a precedent for the other parents to sue for the full price.", "My high school didn\u2019t have lockers. Once at tennis practice, someone hit a ball so badly that it landed amongst all of our backpacks and school stuff (there was no other place to put our things) and broke someone\u2019s iPod.

OPs son is now responsible for where other people put their belongings?", "If his kid broke the windshield of a car he's still liable for damages. It doesn't matter if it's an accident.", "It said like a car with a broken windshield", "Don\u2019t know that Judge Judy would say, but Jesus would say, \u201cWTF was that kid bringing a laptop to a ball park.
