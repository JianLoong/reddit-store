They basically want a free maid and babysitter, you should try to move out ASAP. \n\nSince you pay rent and food already in your house, could you not afford to move out now? Maybe not rent on your own, but with housemates?", "NTA, personally I think your mother is forcing you into a sort of servitude, you babysit your sibling, for free from the sounds of it, yet you pay rent, tell your mother you either pay rent and get paid to babysit or babysitting is the rent. They can't expect you to pay to live their and them not make you any food and expect your to clean up their mess aswell. Tell them to pick one and move out as fast as possible.", "NTA. Why should you have to clean up the mess they made while excluding you? Honestly, I think they're just pushing the \"My house,my rules\" shtick. Any chance you can bunk with a friend until school starts back up? Since you're paying rent anyway, might as well live with someone who seems to actually like you.", "NTA. It sounds like independence will do you well. I hope that\u2019s a goal you\u2019re striving for.", "NTA, and I hope you get out of there soon.", "NTA \n\nYour mother's reaction was unwarranted. You were following her rule of cleaning up your own mess and even went the extra mile to clean up what you could. Threatening to stop buying you food and throwing you out is unfair, considering you contribute by buying your own vegetarian versions and paying rent. \n\nThe family dynamics and expectations need to be addressed in a respectful conversation. You are not the selfish one in this situation.", "NTA. \n\nNot making you dinner, expecting you to clean after them, making you pay rent and babysit.. Sounds like you\u2019re the scapegoat. I\u2019m sorry for you, hope you\u2019ll be able to get away soon", "NTA. Dude WHAT. There mess. They clean it up. Thats ridiculous", "NTA, your mother does not practice what she preaches and, judging from that story, seems abusive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
