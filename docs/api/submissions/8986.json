Bringing a third child into that situation with limited financial resources is a terrible idea. The third child will never get the attention and and resources they need. If that child is also special needs the financial piece will break the family. \n\nIt may sound harsh to say that, but I\u2019ve seen this scenario play out with a family member, and the devastation ten years after having two more babies after having two children, and one of them being special needs is unquantifiable. Both of the younger children have severe special needs and behavioral issues and the financial situation is a nightmare. The one child that isn\u2019t special needs has paid an unbelievable price just trying to have a normal life and get himself through school. \n\nWhile it\u2019s true no one gets to dictate who has a child, OP isn\u2019t actually dictating that. She\u2019s expressing a concern that is completely valid.

I have a special needs child and a typically developed child. My husband and I were on the fence about having a third. We weren't rich,  but the issue came down to if we had another special needs child, would this be a burden on our older one as an adult when we are gone. My guess is that your brother might be thinking if they have a third, the youngest can take care of their older siblings, which is not a great reason to bring another person into this world. Also, having a child who doesn't have health issues might give them joy at times, but will take time away from the two who already will need the majority of their attention.

As a grandmother, I tried to intervene on behalf of a granddaughter with severe delays and was roundly and very loudly admonished. I learned to keep my opinions to myself and let them raise her on their own terms, and now they're welcoming another child when they can barely rub two nickels together.

It definitely doesn\u2019t seem wise to purposefully try to grinch another kid into the current hotbed of chaos.

Who are you to determine who is or isn\u2019t deserving of having another child??\n\nNow, I will also say that your brother and his wife need to go through genetic counseling before trying for another child. They could be endangering the health of their children if you don\u2019t know thus cannot acknowledging the info in the planning of their family based on the risks within their counseling results.\n\nAs well as if having another child will diminish their capacity to care for their existing children\u2019s needs long term. And if their children are going to need extensive medical care, then he and his wife should financially plan accordingly, and plan from there.\n\n**But that\u2019s not up to you!

You\u2019re absolutely right, they should not be having more children at all", "YTA. Reproductive autonomy or not, huh?", "YTA, it isn't your business if it's a good decision or not. Even though disabled kids are never a good choice.", "ESH. You\u2019re a huge AH for saying that their genes suck. It\u2019s gross and ableist.

The only people here who don\u2019t suck are those two little girls.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nyou were being supportive to him though. he shouldn't make any more kids as they will suffer whether they end up having health issues too or not cos there is already 2 high maintenance kids and tons of medical expenses. at this point they should have absolutely no reason to make yet another kid that they cant afford by all means.", "NTA- people just need to be told like it is. its super sad but he needs to take care of his issues at hand first.\n\nmy loved ones will always tell me if i\u2019m doing wrong and i appreciate them for watching out for me even though sometimes their opinions hurt at first.", "Nta but he doesnt have to listen either", "NTA.  \nIf you cannot support the two kids you have, you do not have more. The health issues only exacerbate the financial aspect.", "NTA. Although your comment about bad genes is a bit out there.", "NTA truth of reason", "NTA. You were trying to have an honest conversation about the real life impact of limited resources - not anything about whether or not you love your nieces.", "NTA and I leave it at that", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is a hard, hard truth for your brother and SIL and I wouldn't expect them to take it well since they don't appear to have insight on the matter, but you were right to voice your concern.\n\nIn an ideal world it would be a non-issue. Kid with medical issues? Here's the best care that exists. How much? Don't worry about it - we have a sensible, compassionate healthcare system based on fair taxation and not blowing our collective load on military spending.\n\nAs things stand your nieces will be indirectly harmed by another baby coming into the household, causing a dilution of their parent's attention and functional + financial ability to meet their needs.", "NTA but saying it once is enough. People shouldn't choose to create children they dont know how to provide for.", "NTA", "NTA. Sometimes telling people the hard truth IS supporting them. I don't understand why people like to assume that support means unwavering agreement. Trying for another kid when you can barely support the ones you have is asinine and a sure-fire way to end up with unhappy, neglected children. \n\nMaybe it might work when the kids are older and your brother is more financially stable, but it is irresponsible as hell to try now, unless he's angling for a great reason to eventually get a divorce or something.\n\nWhy are they even trying for another?

Children with health issues need so much time and attention that I can\u2019t imagine trying to bring a second, let alone a third child into the mix.

Quality of life is more important than quantity of life, and it was decent of you to point that out on your nieces\u2019 behalf.

Tell your brother than he can give lessons on how to support people when he can support his daughters.", "Delivery of said message....?", "NAH. You gave some advice you thought would be helpful,  but you also need to understand that your brother deserves a chance to have a normal kid and the experiences that come with that.

Or None.", "This", "Your recommendation was helpful because you suggested a professional who guides and advises families through their genetic history and how that can impact future offspring.", "I don't see what the issue is pointing out they (and by blood, OP) have shitty genes. This isn't like passing down ADHD or even bipolar where you could argue eugenics and not catering to different brains and that shit, both their kids have physical illnesses that could kill either of them at any point and it's immoral to make a person *knowing* that person also has a high chance of dying before they even hit ten years old.", "Had to scroll to see this.", "You\u2019re probably right.

I would recommend apologizing and saying you were out of line.", "Or since the third child will be the youngest and it would take some years to groom her in a parent role, the youngest child will be emotionally and perhaps medically ignored (in small ways) because her siblings' needs are so much greater and more urgent.\n\nI was in that situation with one older sister with serious, ultimately terminal, illness.  Being so busy and worried about one child leaves other children ignored to the point of emotional neglect, and the consequences of that type of neglect stays with one for a lifetime.", "Or neglected because the parents are too busy with special needs siblings", "That might be the goal", "Good grief, will they keep having kids until they get a healthy one to bear the entire burden?", "Who's place is it then?", "> That being said, it's not really your place to tell him.

I'm the older one, but my younger brother had severe health complications as a child (he still suffers the effects of them now, as an adult in his 30s), and any health concerns of mine were neglected. One summer when I was in elementary school, I had managed to get poison oak all over my body from playing in the woods in light summer clothes, and my mom refused to take me to the doctor for it because it \"wasn't nearly as bad as what \\[my brother\\] was dealing with.\" I basically stowed away on a trip to the doctor for him, and when our pediatrician saw me, she said, \"Holy shit, why didn't you bring her in earlier?\" and my mom said, \"She's fine -- she's overreacting,\" and the pediatrician said, \"I've never seen a case of poison oak this bad in all the decades of my career.\" I was old enough to understand that I was being medically neglected, and while I have a good relationship with my mom, I still hold a grudge about the fact that I had to force my way in front of a medical professional as a child younger than 10.", "I sure hope not!!
