You\u2019re NTA for letting your brother know straight up that he shouldn\u2019t put himself in that position and props for not being a yes man.", "NTA people need to stop being selfish and stop bringing kids into this world that they can\u2019t afford and care for. All in the name of \u201cchoice\u201d.  Kids need love and attention and care, and if you can\u2019t give it to them you are a bad bad person for bringing them into this world.", "NTA andi know some parents here are going to blast me but it's morally wrong to bring a child into the world when you damn well know that you can financially or emotionally support them. If that child is born healthy he/she will be subjected to a life of not getting enough parental attention and being forced to be a caregiver.", "NTA. He can't afford the children he has now.", "Not sure why YTA is coming when children are suffering and will continue to suffer because of someone\u2019s shortsightedness\n\nNTA- bringing more kids into the picture when his current kids need all the attention and support they can muster? He is TA here. The truth will be hard for some people but child welfare should come first.", "I\u2019m going with NTA\n\nSpecial needs kids require an intense level of continuing care. Bringing a third child into that situation with limited financial resources is a terrible idea. The third child will never get the attention and and resources they need. If that child is also special needs the financial piece will break the family. \n\nIt may sound harsh to say that, but I\u2019ve seen this scenario play out with a family member, and the devastation ten years after having two more babies after having two children, and one of them being special needs is unquantifiable. Both of the younger children have severe special needs and behavioral issues and the financial situation is a nightmare. The one child that isn\u2019t special needs has paid an unbelievable price just trying to have a normal life and get himself through school. \n\nWhile it\u2019s true no one gets to dictate who has a child, OP isn\u2019t actually dictating that. She\u2019s expressing a concern that is completely valid. A lot of people that continue having children like her brother and his wife are are doing it for the wrong reasons - they want a \u201chealthy\u201d child, maybe they have two boys and want a girl, the reasons are always bad.", "Nta. At all. My uncle has 4 kids. One is half blind and can't hear. One has severe allergies and is allergic to half of the planet and is constantly in shock. one was born without the roof of her mouth. And the other is sociopathic and in therapy for trying to get kids to hurt themselves with things kids shouldn't be aware of. He's not a bad dad. But their genetics don't work together and he nearly lost his house several times. These kids are at the hospital constantly and nearly got taken away because they basically lived there. My family predicted the whole thing after the first baby.", "NTA. They are honestly selfish bringing more children into the world that are bound to have chronic illnesses, and they can not afford to take care of.", "NTA I don't think stating your honest opinion on the fact that they more than have thier hands full already makes you an AH.  It's a valid point.  They don't want to hear the truth because they want to make an emotional and financially irresponsible decision.", "NTA\n\nIm typically all for ppl minding their business but it is overly irresponsible to bring any child into an unstable environment", "NTA They can't afford to provide for their 2 current kids -- there is nothing moral or acceptable or ethical about adding more. They legally have the right to be that selfish, but that doesn't mean they should do so. I hope more people tell them the same thing you did.", "NTA.  \nEven if they have a healthy baby, that childs life will be miserable.

Someone has to.", "NTA. \n\nyour brothers just trying to have that \"normal\" kid, since his other kids have so many health issues. \n\nI would keep an eye out on the other kids, and if they're getting to a point where they are being neglected, you should call child services. \n\nThe kids shouldn't suffer and be neglected just because your brother wants a normal kid.", "Nta BTW I'm disabled myself and it's a miserable existence", "NTA. He needed to hear it. I will never understand people who continue to have kids after having multiple sick ones. Is it judgy? Yes. But they're the AH for putting those kids through that and dividing attention even further away from their special needs kids.", "Definitely NTA...for Pete sake, they can't afford another child regardless if it is healthy or not.", "NTA They sound like they might need a social worker to help them out. I'm really concerned they can't see the issue with having another kid they can't support", "NTA\n\nYou are right in telling your brother that they should not have anymore kids.", "NTA. I have a special needs child and a typically developed child. My husband and I were on the fence about having a third. We weren't rich,  but the issue came down to if we had another special needs child, would this be a burden on our older one as an adult when we are gone. My guess is that your brother might be thinking if they have a third, the youngest can take care of their older siblings, which is not a great reason to bring another person into this world. Also, having a child who doesn't have health issues might give them joy at times, but will take time away from the two who already will need the majority of their attention. Your brother and his wife are thinking magically, and life isn't magical.", "NTA you are just looking after the future of their family. It seems like your brother is blind to realize the situation he is in.", "NTA, either that kid will be sickly in an already financially strapped home, or will have to grow up as a caretaker for their sickly siblings. Your brother and SIL are selfish idiots", "NTA. I know the term \"eugenics\" has some bad connotations to it. Not only was I raised by young parents who really didnt have the finances or maturity, but I suffer from a pretty bad genetic condition that has been passed down throughout my Mom's side of the family and very rarely does a day go by where I don't wish I was dead. It is ridiculously selfish, short-sighted, and just plain stupid for your brother to want to bring more misery into the world.", "Ntta", "Ugh this sucks. I mean you\u2019re right. You are definitely right. That being said, it\u2019s really not your place to tell him that. I would recommend apologizing and saying you were out of line. So YTA but it seems like it was coming from a place of genuine concern. Good luck.", "ESH.\n\nYou butted your nose in where it didn't belong. Even if you're right (you are), you had no business telling him what to do.\n\nHe sucks for doing that thing that all parents of disabled kids do where they keep trying for a perfect one", "ESH, but the brother is more of an A for saying that as his big sister, OP is supposed to support him. Siblings aren\u2019t required to support each other\u2019s every decision and her being the eldest is even more irrelevant. OP should not have \u201cstraight up\u201d told him he shouldn\u2019t have more kids \u2013 it would\u2019ve been better to react neutrally and only give an opinion \u2013 gently \u2013 if he asked for it.

You don\u2019t get to decide who has children and for what reason. You seem a bit pretentious thinking that children with health issues are a burden or less than your apparently healthy children. Stay out of the reproductive issues of others. It\u2019s not your business and you\u2019ve shown yourself to be TA in a big way.", "Nowhere in this post did i see him asking you for anything. Not even your opinion.    \nYTA", "YTA. You obviously don\u2019t know about genes. Down\u2019s syndrome isn\u2019t hereditary. Also, how dare you use that as a reason.", "YTA\n\nIt is up to him and his wife if they want more children. That is their choice and their responsibility if they do. \nAnd be careful talking about bad genes. You share that gene pool...", "Info: Do you help with the kids financially or logistically and would you be expected to continue that help. If not, then YTA because this isn\u2019t your business. If you do, then NTA because this impacts you", "YTA\n\nIt's not your place to tell anyone they shouldn't have more kids.", "YTA \n\nhow would you feel if your brother had told you that you shouldn\u2019t have another baby before you were pregnant with your 12 week old? wether he had a \u201creason\u201d or not. because by the way, health issues like down syndrome and depending on the type of heart defect are mutations that are not only common but not because of his genes. and they\u2019re not a reason to not have a child anyways.", "I completely understand your concern, especially with their financial situation. As a grandmother, I tried to intervene on behalf of a granddaughter with severe delays and was roundly and very loudly admonished. I learned to keep my opinions to myself and let them raise her on their own terms, and now they're welcoming another child when they can barely rub two nickels together. So I'm delivering a soft YTA verdict.", "YTA, although you meant well. You're not a doctor. The person he should be having this conversation with is a genetic counselor, and if you wanted to help, you should have suggested that.", "YTA. That\u2019s the kind of opinion you keep to yourself.", "I mean, I agree with your opinion on them having more kids HOWEVER he didn\u2019t ask you for your opinion and that\u2019s why YTA.", "YTA.", "YTA - He wasn\u2019t asking for your opinion IF they should have more children, so your opinion should have been kept to yourself. If you\u2019re not paying for or taking care of the children or paying your brother\u2019s bills, you have no say in the matter.", "Soft YTA. You concerns about being them using common sense or able to adequately care for the kids that they already have are understandable, but unless any of this will end up being your responsibility ,(which doesn\u2019t seem out of he realm of possibility), it\u2019s not for you comment. It definitely doesn\u2019t seem wise to purposefully try to grinch another kid into the current hotbed of chaos. We\u2019ve raised one kid with medical needs, advanced degrees and financial privilege and it still took everything I had to do it well!", "YTA - because you literally cannot tell people to not procreate. Who are you to determine who is or isn\u2019t deserving of having another child??\n\nNow, I will also say that your brother and his wife need to go through genetic counseling before trying for another child. They could be endangering the health of their children if you don\u2019t know thus cannot acknowledging the info in the planning of their family based on the risks within their counseling results.\n\nAs well as if having another child will diminish their capacity to care for their existing children\u2019s needs long term. And if their children are going to need extensive medical care, then he and his wife should financially plan accordingly, and plan from there.\n\n**But that\u2019s not up to you! So you can give it advisement or suggestions, but what you said is absolutely out of line.**", "Judgey McJudgey face has entered the chat apparently. Yes you should not have told him that and kept your opinions firmly to yourself. If this is how you think, then keeping your opinions to yourself would be a good option more generally going forward.
