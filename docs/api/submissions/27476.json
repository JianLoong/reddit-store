Another reason is so that family reunions and holidays are easier \u2014 everyone attends the same events and your parents will always get to see you!   \nThe final reason has to do with patriarchal expectations and control over women, as well as a lack of women\u2019s rights \u2014 marriages were arranged like business transactions or used to settle up debts.    Women aren\u2019t expected to go out, date, or meet anyone outside of family members, so it became commonplace to marry extended relatives.    \n\nI commend you on taking steps to secure your own freedom and not having to marry your cousin.   \n\nBut please keep in mind that there\u2019s a reason your mom thinks this is \u201ca good idea\u201d and culturally it\u2019s her norm.  \n\nNot all cultural beliefs are healthy or should be perpetuated!
