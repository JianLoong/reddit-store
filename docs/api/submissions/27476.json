Your reaction is totally reasonable especially when you voiced your opinions already. Honestly my only advice I can think of is probably going to low or no contact with your mom and possibly your family depending on their reaction of these events.", "NTA, 100% not the asshole.\n\nshe is trying to force you into what she considers to be an acceptable lifestyle, but your lifestyle has to be acceptable to you, that is the opinion that matters.", "NTA. WTF, marrying a cousin is disgusting. Your mother is controlling and manipulative (\"don't you love me\" is a bullshit thing to say in an argument). I strongly advise that you go low contact as soon as you've moved out.", "Well, its not like, *\"YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR MOTHER!\"* is a vicious indictment. You love her. You just have no plan to *be* like her, or let her run your life. I bet your cousin was mortified listening to that conversation? omg. NTA. Could not possibly be in the wrong on this one.\n\nRevel in some peace and quiet for a few weeks and then remind her that adults live their lives independently. They select their own marriage partners. And she has to respect that you have agency for the rest of your life.\n\nHug her, And stop worrying about upsetting her. She made a mistake - not you.", "NTA. It's pretty straightforward. What your mother wants for you is not what you want for you. Moving out to your own place looks like a really good idea.\n\nJust continue living your life and don't worry about what your parents think about your choices.", "Bruh NTA, and you know that. No matter how this is \u201enormal\u201c, that is *not okay* and absolutely a cause to move out! My best wishes for the future!", "NTA.\n\nDon't know if it's appropriate, but can't stop thinking about the lines: \"I believe I can fly, I believe I can touch the sky. Spread my wings and fly away.\". You better do just that, because this is absolutely crazy. Fly high, far and FAST. And your cousin/aunt/uncle/relatives just what... went along with this? There's definitely something wrong with them. If I were you, I wouldn't even finish unpacking, I'd pack it all right back up and move all the way across the country without leaving an address for them to track you back to. What they want to do is just... wrong? And that's putting it very mildly. There obviously is something very wrong about the whole lot of that family, but that's their issues to fix. Why would you want to throw your life away to stay inside a family that is apparently okay with INCEST? By any chance, do you live in Alabama? Because well, I don't wanna be prejudiced, but I just can't help but wonder... Also, if your cousin actually happened to be that great, he wouldn't need his aunt playing \"desperate matchmaker\".", "NTA  Your mother may want to follow old traditions but that does not mean that's what you want.  Your mother is being very manipulative and acting like a bully.  She is playing the old guilt trip game.  Moving into your own place was a good decision.  You cannot change how she behaves but you can control how much you put up with.  It might be a good idea to go no contact for a couple of weeks.  Your mom will hopefully settle down once you are completely out and settled in your own place.", "NTA. You have to leave if you want to have control over your life. They are emotionally manipulating you to force you to do what they want.   \nYour next step is to talk to a therapist so they can help you navigate though all the bullshit your family is putting you through.   \nNow that you're out of the house you can pull yourself out of the drama. You don't need to yell at your mom anymore. Hold firm boundaries and don't try to convince her of anything. 'Why can't you marry this person.' 'Sorry that's not my path.' 'Don't you love me.' 'I do love you but that's not my path.'  \n\n\nThen if she keeps trying to argue tell her you're not going to argue about it. If he keeps trying tell her goodbye and hang up the phone. Don't get into power struggles with her.", "NTA\n\nHowever, with the \"why can't you be like your brother\" you need to have an answer ready.  \n\n\"I'm terribly sorry I didn't die when I was 3.  I hate to be a disappointment to you.  If I could go back in time to make this right, I would do so, just to make you happy!\"\n\nIt's quite rare for an angry parent to set themselves up so clearly with a ridiculous complaint, and it deserves a clever answer that drives home what they don't realize they are actually saying.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So when you asserted your independence by moving out, your mom tried to regain control by getting you married to someone within the family.

And go NC until you do. JFC", "You have to realize that while this is totally upsetting, and incestual, and you are NTA \u2014 this is completely normal in your mom & dad\u2019s culture.   \n\nAren\u2019t you aware how common consanguineous marriages are in many Indian / Pakistani / MEastern / other Asian cultures?    It\u2019s been done that way for many generations.   \nOne reason is to keep familial wealth within the family.   Another reason is so that family reunions and holidays are easier \u2014 everyone attends the same events and your parents will always get to see you!   \nThe final reason has to do with patriarchal expectations and control over women, as well as a lack of women\u2019s rights \u2014 marriages were arranged like business transactions or used to settle up debts.    Women aren\u2019t expected to go out, date, or meet anyone outside of family members, so it became commonplace to marry extended relatives.    \n\nI commend you on taking steps to secure your own freedom and not having to marry your cousin.   \n\nBut please keep in mind that there\u2019s a reason your mom thinks this is \u201ca good idea\u201d and culturally it\u2019s her norm.  \n\nNot all cultural beliefs are healthy or should be perpetuated!    But you really should know how common this is (and still happens today) in your culture of origin.   \n\nConsider looking for a therapist of a similar background to you or one who has experience dealing with such familial issues.   \n\nAnd take a look at the relevant subreddits for how other people of your background deal with their parental expectations, marriage arrangements, etc.   /r/desi and a few others come to mind.  \n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong \u2014 you are right, and deserve your own life.

Also, definitely tell people around you what they are trying to force you into, friends, relatives, neighbours. Don't keep it to yourself out of a misplaced sense of \"shame\", the ones who need to feel that are the ones who want to force you into a incestuous marriage. \n\nKeeping that a secret is only doing you a disservice. If possible, you might want to go to the nearest police station and give them notice that your safety is actively being threatened by family trying to force incestuous marriage onto you. Get some proof (recordings, screenshots, whatever you manage to get your hands on) to support your claims. You might also want to have a lawyer get involved to know what other steps you could take to ensure your safety moving forward, especially if you consider leaving the country or in matters of next of kin.", "Don't try to change her mind.
