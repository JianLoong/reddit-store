She has really long hair and sheds everywhere while I have short hair. \n\nWe used to have a problem with the shower getting clogged with hair and I kept having to ask her to clean it which she did but she would complain about finding poop in it as she picked out the hair. Where I grew up, it is considered unclean to use toilet paper and toilets have a handheld mini shower we call a shatafa and use to spray clean our bums. I am not religious and this is not a religion thing, I just find the thought of smearing poop around to clean it disgusting as some of it probably adheres to the skin.\n\nSo after I poop, I clean up in the shower. The only reason poop got stuck in the drain is because her hair had clogged it there, otherwise it would have gone through.\n\nRecently she got a drain cover to make it easier to clean, the drain cover holds her hair but the problem is it also collects poop chunks. She wants both of us to clean the drain cover after use, however I think this is unfair as the drain cover is only there because of her shedding problem and without it or her hair there would be no issues. I don't see how it is fair and besides if both of us have to clean it everytime, we use the shower so frequently that it would make no difference if just she did it.\n\nShe didn't say anything when I explained this but she has been acting cold towards me since when we normally get along very well and do things together all the time.", "created_utc": 1681240159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12iu3he/aita_for_not_cleaning_the_shower_drain_cover_my/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
