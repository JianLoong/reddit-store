See what the year brings and decide later in the year", "yta   - you want to choose and pick which days you spend with who but you don't want to give him the same freedom.", "YTA - I think if you\u2019re serious about this relationship long term, you should probably get used to the idea of splitting holidays between your families", "Fair, I understand what you mean by this. I should Edit to say I told him I\u2019m happy to fly to see him either of the weeks and he could choose which was better for him but Christmas is traditionally more important to him and his family. It\u2019s a transatlantic flight and school will not be in the same state as my family so both weeks will require traveling and planning on my end. logistically it doesn\u2019t work out well to visit for the 5 days in between Christmas and new years for example so I figured the only way to do it is one and one", "Fair enough, especially in terms of splitting but it doesn\u2019t feel like splitting since he\u2019s unwilling to miss one with his mom to spend with my family. I offered to switch and do Christmas week with only him instead and we can do new years separately with our own respective family but his argument stays the same. It\u2019s also a temporary issue as he plans to moving to the US second half of 2025 so the distance issue will go away and I won\u2019t feel as in need of alone time during my 2 weeks off that year since I\u2019ll have more opportunities to see him in day to day life."]}
