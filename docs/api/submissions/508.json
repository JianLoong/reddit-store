And belive me I know she won't take it at all, I would get another ban on something else or extension of the curent one I have.", "My dad wasn't at home then and often refuses to give her money beacouse she borrows it from him half of the time (from 63 to 950 dollars). She probably thinks I'm an easier spot to get money from.", "Not good. Not good at all. Can you maybe put it into a bottle with a cap, and then hide in the bushes somewhere? Or under a rock?\n\nNot the perfect solution, but not having any money in your room might be a solution.\n\nAnd I feel like 'cleaning' the room of a 16 y/o is an euphemism for snooping! You have a right to privacy!\n\nCan you ask your dad if he can put half your wage in a fund for your future education? Or help you set up a bank account?\n\nMake it sound like this is very important for you to grow up, be a responsible adult, learn how to handle money, etc. Don't ever mention your mom.\n\nNot sure how well your parents work as a couple, but this could otherwise make him snitch on you. If you're 100% sure he would support you, you could approach him directly.\n\nI still stand with my voting. You're a responsible adolescent, who tries to get a grip on your life. Just taking your money is *never* okay. Especially not by family!\n\nTaking more than agreed upon is theft!", "I don't think I could hide it outside beacouse I live in a big neiborhood with only blocks, and it only have a lot of space that evryone is allowed, even people who don't live near. \n\nI asked my mom to stop a lot of times since she would \"clean\" my room since I can remember but she never really stops even when she tells me she will.\n\nI asked my dad reasently (I've been asking for one since i was 13 bc its a minimal age where I live to have one) for a bank account and he agreed, I will soon have one and I'm planing to put at least half or more of my money there. We will go to the bank whenever he will have time.\n\nI don't think my mom knows about it and I'm kinda happy about it. But I know she will find out sooner or later end def will blow.", "Make sure to have a talk with your dad about it.\n\nI'm a parent, so take my advice with a grain of salt. (Note that I am genderfluid and don't call myself a mother ;) queers need to stand together!)\n\nI would always want my kids to be prepared to live on their own. That is why I would suggest you go that route when talking to him about your mother maybe trying to get access to your bank account.\n\nTell him you want to be solely responsible for it. For all positive, and negative income. That you want to prove how responsible you can be.\n\nAsk for his help, and his advice. How much money should you put on there? If you want to buy something, how long is waiting for a discount a good idea? Is a cheaper, lower quality good maybe an option, or would he rather go for better quality, even when it is pricey?\n\nThe goal are several things:\n* Pamper his ego by making him your trusted advisor\n* But also make sure it's a good relationship you have, because that will carry you through your life (got an inkling more than your mother right now)\n* You might actually learn something, which is always a plus\n* Good memories about your time with Dad - one day you'll look at them and feel all warm and fuzzy about it\n* He might be able to protect you, and your money, from your mother\n* She will have to fight it out with him, who is her equal, not you, who she has power over\n\nShe will absolutely hate it. Your life at home will get rough(er). I'm sorry about that, and still I see no other choice.\n\nThe job of a parent is making sure your kid can stand on their own feet once they've grown up. You can't life as a leech, ahem I mean in symbiosis, with your children forever.\n\nYou will have to learn how to set firm boundaries with your mother. You get to have a say in how your relationship will continue, going forward.\n\nMight means going low or no contact with someone who can't let you grow up to be your own person.\n\nI'm worried for you, though. It's going to be rough no matter what. Please make sure to keep in touch with your dad, who sounds like a good man.", "I will deffintly talk with my dad when I can and probably do It tomorow since I got a free monday and spending it working with my dad. My uncle and grandpa are also are going to be there so maybe I will talk with them too? Idk im sure they won't tell my mom since they don't get really along anymore.\n\nI get it will be kida rougher but I'm kinda used to it by now. I try to stand up for myself as much I can. My dad also protects me as much as he can but it's really hard for him since he works in a City half hour/hour away from where we live and isn't present at home most of the time(from 7 to 9) to make money for all of us. But he tries his best, he def is a good person. \n\nI tried starting setting boundaries with my mom when I was 13 but it didn't really work and she only got more angry at me for trying to have privcy. It lead to me not knowing how they work and in past I would accidently break boundaries of my friends. I think it's better now but still doesn't work on my mom. I think it might be beacouse she also grew up in home with no privcy and also was abused.\n\nThere isn't really much to be woried about tbh. I figured out most things on my own and as I said before used to it. I know I shouldn't be but it is how it is. I will make sure to talk with my dad he is deffinitly a good parent for me. And thank you for being so kind about that whole thing it really means so much.", "You sound like a nice kid, honestly. I wish you all the best.\n\nAnd maybe, if you ever chose to have children, you're able to break the cycle.\n\nReaching out to your uncle, grandpa, etc is a good idea. Everyone who can back you up, who you can trust.\n\nThose relationships will build you up if you ever need to cut your mother out for a while. Family is important. It's a part of who you are.\n\n\nTake care!\n<3", "You sound like a nice and responsible person too, I'm happy that there are people like you.\n\nI don't plan to have bio kids beacouse I'm ace but I think of adopting in the future but not for sure. I still have to work trugh some of my trauma and grow up I'm underage after all. I also try to help my cousins break the cycle.\n\nYou also take care <333"]}
