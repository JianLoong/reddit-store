Their lack of planning is no one else\u2019s problem.", "NTA,  you were in the right the whole time, the fact he was rude with \u201cmove your crap\u201d just gives you a more valid reason not to accommodate him.  They\u2019re stuck together for the next 50 years, they can sit apart for 3 hours.", "NTA. Also, how rude of the guy to ask you to move your \u201ccrap\u201d. Even if you hadn\u2019t paid for the second seat, there is a way to ask people to move their stuff.", "NTA.  Their poor planning isn't your problem and they were rude to you.  They could have boarded earlier and got seats together.", "NTA. If it was a priority they should have upgraded boarding or flown an airline that does reserved seating. Entitled people suck. And people who think getting married is an accomplishment that means the world should revolve around them also suck.", "NTA\n\nPeople complain about fat people not fitting into the seats and how they should have just bought two of them for their comfort. You DID buy two for your comfort and still got backlash. Danged if you do, danged if you dont. Geez.", "NTA. They didn't get assigned seats for their honeymoon, that's on them or whoever cheaped out on the damn booking for their most special of occasions. \n\nI hope you enjoyed your flight and were capable of relaxing appropriately. It is what you paid for, after all.", "NTA. If the newlyweds had put 10 seconds of consideration into seating on the flight they'd have been fine.

If the stewardess said you're right, then you were definitely in the right.

You have no obligation to give it up so two other people could sit next to each other. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with *asking* on his part but the attitude shows he's entitled to your seat in his mind he can deal.", "NTA", "NTA first off rude from that guy to tell you remove that crap from your seat. They should have planned it out more like you did if they wanted to sit together. Instead of expecting you to accommodate for them at you expense.", "NTA, i bet they pull this stunt every time they fly instead of paying for seats together.

It's not your obligation to move for couples children family whatever. If they wanna sit together they need to pay", "NTA.  You took responsibility for your own needs by paying for the second seat and the priority boarding.  You have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to give up what you need and paid for to fly comfortably to accommodate the preferences of adults.", "NTA- everyone knows how southwest works. They didn\u2019t want the upcharge but wanted the perks. Entitled.", "Nah you paid its yours to do as you please. The guy needs to learn the valuable lesson of life which is. Nobody gives a fuck about you or your wedding and to keep it pushing. I put that a bit harshly but it true no one cares about others lives and what they got going on its no one's business but theirs and your business is yours.", "NTA...\n\nI bet there was 1 spot available in a worse spot... They couldve swapped with another person there (who would sit in your row) and they couldve sat together there.\n\nBut they wanted a free upgrade!", "NTA.  Thank you for for taking the initiative to buy an extra seat assuring your own comfort and those around you.  The newlyweds are cheapskates for not paying a fee and getting a chance at early boarding like you did.", "NTA.  \n\nThe only folks you should (morally) accommodate on something of this nature is a make-a-wish kid.

Oof.\n\nIn any case, you're NTA to not want to give up your seat for whatever reason. Airline tickets are already so expensive and you paid for two tickets AND an upgrade. If sitting together was important, they could have paid the upgrade to be seated earlier, requested it pre-boarding at the gate, flown an airline that doesn't have open seating, or politely asked anyone to move. It says a lot that it didn't occur to them to ask anyone else if they'd be willing to sit in the aisle next to you so they could be together (who wouldn't be willing to switch? I'd be so happy to sit next to you and your empty seat than right next to a ticked-off dude!) and instead they seemed set on pressuring you.", "Or at least pay a little more for priority boarding if it\u2019s that important to you.  I have no issue with hotels, airlines, etc., throwing in perks for customers\u2019 special occasions, but it is peak entitlement to not only expect but demand it", "I mean it's fine to decide to book economy flights for your honeymoon... what's not okay is demanding someone else give up their paid for seat and being rude to them in the process.", "Oh didn't know that, interesting.
