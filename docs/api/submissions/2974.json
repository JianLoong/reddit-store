At the time the funds were used with the understanding at some time it would be replaced to purchase an iPad. \n\nTo the current issue at hand my main device I use is an iMac desktop which has become more challenging for me as my youngest is 2 months and breastfeeds so I\u2019m unable to do any work at my desk and it\u2019s rather uncomfortable. Added to that I\u2019m spending a lot of time away from home in the hospital with down time in between and the only device I have available to me is my phone. I mentioned to him within the last 2 weeks I would have to prioritize getting myself the iPad as it\u2019s becoming harder and harder for me to study at my desk and I\u2019m getting nothing done. \n\nNow he was previously an avid PC gamer but with 2 young kids it\u2019s become harder for him to do. He purchased a game console recently as he was complaining he didn\u2019t have anytime for himself and had no outlet to do anything. I had no issue with this. Now he\u2019s saying he wants to buy a laptop for about $400. I can get a refurbished iPad for $469 so I asked him why buy the laptop before the iPad. His justification is that he would eventually need the laptop. \nI told him he has his console to play he doesn\u2019t right at this moment need the laptop whereas I need the iPad. He says he\u2019s buying the laptop and I\u2019ll get the iPad eventually. I argued he should buy the iPad before the laptop and we are currently locked in a disagreement as to who is right\n\nEdit: I spoke to him after this post once I\u2019d stopped being as  pissed. His explanation is he has a course he wants to do which would enable him to get a position above what he currently has. So that\u2019s what he wants the laptop for.
