I previously used to work before the pandemic whilst I was in school. In 2020 I sold the iPad and Apple Pencil I had to purchase an upgrade version. Certain issues arose namely car problems (the car is not in my name was purchased before we were married). At the time the funds were used with the understanding at some time it would be replaced to purchase an iPad. \n\nTo the current issue at hand my main device I use is an iMac desktop which has become more challenging for me as my youngest is 2 months and breastfeeds so I\u2019m unable to do any work at my desk and it\u2019s rather uncomfortable. Added to that I\u2019m spending a lot of time away from home in the hospital with down time in between and the only device I have available to me is my phone. I mentioned to him within the last 2 weeks I would have to prioritize getting myself the iPad as it\u2019s becoming harder and harder for me to study at my desk and I\u2019m getting nothing done. \n\nNow he was previously an avid PC gamer but with 2 young kids it\u2019s become harder for him to do. He purchased a game console recently as he was complaining he didn\u2019t have anytime for himself and had no outlet to do anything. I had no issue with this. Now he\u2019s saying he wants to buy a laptop for about $400. I can get a refurbished iPad for $469 so I asked him why buy the laptop before the iPad. His justification is that he would eventually need the laptop. \nI told him he has his console to play he doesn\u2019t right at this moment need the laptop whereas I need the iPad. He says he\u2019s buying the laptop and I\u2019ll get the iPad eventually.

AH move by him. I hope he changes his mind and you get what you need. I also hope he is able to afford his laptop soon after.", "The iPad was sold to fix his car. Then he bought a gaming system. It is now your turn before he gets another thing to game on. Especially since the iPad was sold to fix his car with the agreement that you would get another iPad. NTA and it's kind of worrying that if you guys have such a tight budget that your husband is okay with buying himself two devices just to game on. Especially since if you can use yours for school, it pays itself off eventually when you can get a better job.", "The Ipad is for work, it takes priority here and he has an obligation since you helped him with his car which was necessary for work.\n\nGaming can wait till after the work/house/baby needs are all good then he can spend what he wants on gaming.  \n\nAlso personally laptop in $400 range?  I'd go desktop in $900-1000 range personally even if it took a year or so to save up.  Just so much better.  And I did do that several years ago still very happy with it.  One can get a laptop with the same kind of performance but then your spending a lot more.", "NTA regardless of why the iPad was sold. I'm surprised your husband wants to prioritize his gaming PC over helping you do your work with a newborn.", "NTA, based on what you've written, it looks like his wants/needs come before yours and that is not a good thing for a stranger to notice.\n\nThe iPad for you is a 2 for 1, in that you need it for school, but can also use it for fun, however it is primarily for school and should have been replaced awhile ago.\n\nSomething about your money situation seems off, but I'm not sure how/where.  Wether you have split or combined finances I think everything needs to be looked over again and divided up approximately.  When dividing, imo going by net percentages is the fair way to go.", "NTA. It sounds like this was an already agreed upon thing and you should be getting the iPad before a laptop. You gave yours up with the understanding that it would be replaced and it's for school not fun.", "NTA\n\nHe is being unfair, as well as the AH. He used your ipad money to fix HIS car. He agreed at the time he wanted to use the money to fix his car, that the next thing would be to replace your ipad. Instead of saving up for that, he is choosing to use the money to buy a laptop for him to game on, 'for relaxation' as opposed to buying the ipad for you to do work on.\n\nIf he cant understand the logistics of this, he is not only an AHole but he is also unintelligent.", "NTA.  He's being selfish and acting like this is his decision.  He's also prioritizing gaming over med school.", "NTA. The car is in his name and he used your money to fix it.

Yours, his, or joint/shared money?", "NTA. Even in a scenario where you didn't need the iPad for work, buying a laptop in the event he \"might need it\" doesn't make any sense and for $400 dollars it's not gonna be gaming like his console does so it seems like a waste of money anyway especially when, depending on the console he bought, can do everything your husband would want from a $400 laptop.\n\nI think your husband just wants a new toy and this is what he can afford right now.

I'm not understanding how he recently purchased a console and now wants something different. Assuming he got a ps5 or Xbox series s/x, that's up to $500. Why didn't he get the computer instead if that's what he prefers? Also, $400 isn't going to get a gaming laptop. A gaming pc is much more expensive. If you NEED the iPad, you should get the iPad before he gets something for pleasure, especially since he's already got something for the very same purpose. (gaming)", "NTA. Your stuff was sold to fix his car. Replacing those items should be first priority. His car might not be a \u201cfun\u201d item, but it is his and it\u2019s getting him to work. That thing was for him. Then he bought another thing for him, and now he wants to buy himself a laptop.\n\nWhen do your needs/wants get addressed, and why aren\u2019t they coming in tandem with his? I get that your husband misses being able to game as much, but that\u2019s the trade off of having kids. Not to mention that he just bought a console that he can play games on. I think your husband is being selfish, but y\u2019all might want to really discuss the reality of your situation and recognize how your husband feels. His feelings are valid but he\u2019s also got to recognize the current reality.", "It seems you two are functioning as two individuals instead of a family. In that case you can demand to get paid for taking care of the kids. Then you would have money to buy an ipad.", "I thought you might be the AH until I read about the games console.  Like you say, he has the games console, so he doesn't need the laptop.  Alternatively, you could get the iPad and he could sell the games console and get a laptop instead.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Replacing the funds that were taken obviously comes first; your husband sounds like quite the selfish d-bag.", "NTA - You can get a new ipad (9th gen) from Apple for $329.", "Nah. More of a disagreement than someone being an asshole. He has his reasons you have yours no one is being unreasonable just have to work it out", "400$ laptop definetly is not for gaming. All its good for is browsing internet and possibly Being able use streaming services  such as netflix and others. So it would only be a side gadget for minor convenience xd", "Yea honestly what games is he going to play on a laptop he bought for $400?  Pacman?", "Not to mention no $400 laptop will play any modern games.", "> He used your money to fix his car. He\n\nWe don't know this. We only know that someone used someone's money to fix someone's car. The whole thing is very confusing.", "we have shared expenses but right now he\u2019s the one working. \n\nThe car is his but the money used was from the sale of my old iPad and Apple Pencil. So my funds it was cash given to him to pay for repairs and parts", "If you want to game with your laptop, you need to invest atleast 3x more than 400. That price is fine for browsing stuff but it would overheat In a second if you tried to game with it. Also the components are so cheap=outdated/worst possible quality, that they propably wouldnt even run anything except super low quality games.\n\nTherefor it definetly cant be for gaming", "I wrote all my notes on notability and goodnotes and backed it up before I sold it. So all my notes for an entire year I have no access to.

Right now I\u2019m just reading on my phone", "Yeah why can\u2019t they share?", "I imagine an iMac is about as useful for gaming as a $400 laptop.  But to be fair I haven't been paying much attention to mac gaming.", "It\u2019s the iPad Air I wanted tbh the 9th gen is a shit show with the Pencil and how it needs to be charged. My previous pencil actually cracked because of how the pencil had to charge. So with education pricing I was going to buy the pro originally which was what I had the cash for. The air is cheaper than that so it\u2019s still less money that what I originally would have spent plus buying it refurbished is a further discount", "I disagree. She paid to fix HIS car with HER iPad money. He owes her that money. Flat out. He said he would buy her an iPad when he was able. Guess what....he was able and bought himself a gaming console. NOW he is able to buy her the iPad again and *wants to buy himself a new laptop*. Dude is a selfish prick.", "How do we not know that. She literal says it!\n\n*the car is not in my name was purchased before we were married* ie his car", "Do you use the car?", "Seconding this. A $400 laptop won't even be able to start any game from the last decade.", "Ahhh well that sucks that the issues falls into Being all about the Brand,  instead of some difference In functionality between different devices.\n\n\nI guess NTA then.", "Gotcha!  You know what works best for you. I hope you get it. It's your turn and you need it for school. That trumps gaming.", "No, she simply said it wasn't her car. She didn't say whose car it was or who purchased it.", "No I don\u2019t drive. I use it as far as it\u2019s used to get me and the kids to and from where we need to go.
