Her protectiveness over your daughter from normal childhood embarrassment in a safe space feels excessive, and I can only guess it stems from her own experiences. Although your daughter may be embarrassed years later, right now this process is all about identity forming. Some performances will be received well, others won\u2019t, and she will adapt.

I know it takes away the spontaneity but it'll ease your wifes feelings sof being suddenly embarrassed. \n\nKeep going how you are I think your doing a great job with your kid, but remember patience it'll take a bit to get where everything is smooth, I hope the best for you and your family.

I loved to sing as a kid. Loved it. I was horrible at it, but loved it. My parents encouraged me. Rest of the family (all good singers, I must say), did not. I was basically told so often by them that I could not sing, that by the time I reached my mid-teens, I stopped singing, unless I was absolutely sure no one could hear me.\n\nThen in my early 20s I met the man I was going to marry. A musician. At some point, quite a few years into our relationship, I thought I was home alone and walked around the house singing. Turns out, he was sitting in his practice room figuring out some arrangements for a gig he was playing that weekend.\n\nHe came downstairs and asked me why I didn't sing more often. I told him that I couldn't sing.\n\nLong story short, my adult voice is actually nice enough for people to listen to. Yes, I'm quite sure my child voice was horrible. But my adult voice is nice, and now I sing in public and even for audiences. It took quite a few years to get over the idea that I can't sing too. Such a shame of all that wasted time.\n\nSo, moral of the story: never, ever tell her she can't sing and don't let anyone humiliate her into stopping. Maybe she'll never have a voice that is nice to listen to. But she will always have a voice that she herself can enjoy.", "Wow... So much NTA !\nYou are an amazing dad, your with on the other hand is just projecting her fears onto her daughter. She needs therapy to understand how to stop doing that and support her daughter.\n\nI mean the girl was having fun, everyone was having fun and no one was talking things seriously, why would she put her down?\nShe needs to accept that daughter's personality is greater than hers and start supporting it rather than make her ashamed of it", "NTA Your daughter is having fun with her singing and that's all that matter. If you can't show your not-so-perfect side infront of your family, where then? Just to let go and have fun. It seems that the image is more important for your wife than the feelings. So sad. Please have an eye of her. Especially if your daughter get older it is important that she stay true to herself and not just do things to keep up a good image.", "NTA How is a child singing along to a Christmas Carol making a scene?

This is definitely not something I had considered and I'm going to have a conversation with my wife about it.", "Maybe consider to get her voice teacher so she is in tune and not harming her vocal cords.
