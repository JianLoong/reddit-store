Yes, I know she's high-risk but there's a limit to how much leeway she should be allowed to get. You were harsh but right - you're NOT her partner or parent to her child, and she has to stand on her own eventually. You cannot and should not cater to her forever. Also, you have your own family to take care of too. I suggest you have a proper talk with your husband about this, then lay out some set house rules and boundaries, or you might all burn out and grow bitter at each other.

Yes, pregnancy sucks, it's hard, it's painful (I hated it both times).  I had cravings - which I usually solved on my trips to the grocery store.  Cravings for me weren't fleeting, with the first one it was dairy and protein (chicken liver pate, ugh), the second one was heat (Mexican food for the most part).  I would grab a bunch of those.  Bacon made me nauseous even though I love bacon.  didn't buy bacon, bought the thing I knew I would HAVE TO HAVE.\n\nthe one thing I had with both was diet Coke slurpies from 7-11.

Her cravings are unreasonable for her financial situation. Perhaps you all could meet in the middle with a small budget for craving foods that she can eat in her room only so the kids aren't all eyes and questions. Not sure of your area, but I would think $5-$10 a week or something small for pre-made baked goods or candy or something that would keep well in her room might not break the bank and would help a bit to ease the tension between her cravings and your wallet and sanity. She also needs to get it together on the stuff she's going to need for the baby and start applying to every program she can find. Diapers, clothes, cribs, bottles,  strollers etc all seem to be getting more expensive by the day and she needs to find a way to prepare for that baby without even thinking about your wallet. You might be able to provide some hand me downs but that can only go so far. Good luck, I hope things work out for you all.", "NTA - She needs to create a plan to take care of her whims and requests. Start with getting on nutritional assistance paired with doctor visits and a nutritionist. \n\nNow is the perfect time for her to learn strategy, self resiliency and responsibility.

You already feel put upon in life, because you have a diabetic child and your two picky kids each have a sweet tooth, so you're already spending more time on food as a task than you expected.\n\nAnd here she is, not liking anything you make, wanted to be waited upon and have you spend money for junk food, and you don't even like her.\n\nLook, you don't have to be noble all the time. Serving people when you resent it, is something that should be very, very limited, because you all end up feeling like garbage. You need a new plan and to get out of this role, while also hopefully not turning your SIL out on the street. How can she stay there without you being so involved and responsible for her? Brainstorm.\n\nSit down with your husband and ask him what he thinks his sister should do about her situation if there were no YOU to take care of her. Make a literal list. Where would housing, food, medicine, things for the baby come from? Then start making that list, because you are not here for this, for one second longer than you have to be. If there is any way to get her settled and provided for, somewhere else, you'd better do it in the next two months because there is NO way you are moving her out with a 3mo.\n\nYou said she's 6mo pregnant and you plan for her to be out when the baby is 3 months. My god. You think a woman coming off of a high risk pregnancy with a newborn is going to heal, regain strength from resting so much, take care of that newborn, find a place to live, get a full-time, living-wage JOB, and save first, last, deposit, etc., and be able to afford food, medicine, diapers, formula, childcare? Delusional.\n\nFind the aid now. Make the plan now, but even with a better head start, you're probably going to have her and her baby in your home for more like a year to 18 months at best, unless she finds a boyfriend or something. There are people right now working for YEARS to save up to get into an apartment, and/or to find a job that will cover rent, without also coming off a high risk pregnancy and taking care of a newborn! So unless somebody's got a money tree, if you are making a commitment to her, it's going to be for longer than baby's 3mo birthday.\n\nAs you are starting to find aid, very clearly right now, the food thing is at the top of your list. Get the SNAP, WIC, whatever she is eligible for. And when she obtains food for herself with those resources, keep your kids out of it. Family meals that you cook, can be whatever you make, and try not to begrudge her a plate. There is no reason for you to cook special foods or go to the Dairy Queen.", "NTA. You are not obligated to spend money outside of your budget so she can eat junk food. Pregnant women don\u2019t NEED junk food.

The three adults need to sit down and figure out what SIL being part of the household is going to look like, what is allowed and what isn\u2019t, etc. Because both of you are on course for major resentment which is going to impact your mental health, your children, and your marriage. NAH.", "NAH. You are kind to open your home to her and support her, but you need to set boundaries. It seems you are willing to spend some money on food for her, why not decide on the exact amount and give it to her so she can shop on her own? Is she receiving food stamps?", "ESH. Her demands are not reasonable, but rather than discussing it as adults you chose to lash out at a hormonal, pregnant single mom to be.\n\nHave a rational discussion tomorrow and set some boundaries. Make it clear what you will do or not do. Be accommodating to what is reasonable.\n\nAnd your husband sucks too for not de-escalating the situation.", "YTA.  The boundaries you set are 100% reasonable, and you are a generous soul for taking her in -- and the way you delivered the information was needlessly cruel.\n\nIt's always a two-edged sword when someone posts a solid position that is communicated heartlessly, but the question isn't, \"Have I placed my boundary at the right distance?\", but \"Am I The Asshole?\"  \n\nShe might be a user who takes a mile if you give her an inch, but you can set the boundary without making her feel like what she is:  unwanted, unloved, vulnerable, in dangerously bad health, broke, scared, and dependent on people who are making it abundantly clear that she is an unwelcome burden.  What's going to happen when the baby comes?  \n\nWhen she asks for things, all you have to say is, \"No.\"  You don't have to explain yourself, but if you want to, you can phrase it as courteously and compassionately as you did in your post:  \"I totally get the nausea, but making meals that both of my kids will eat without complaint is hard enough.\"\n\nBringing her kid's father into it was quite the low blow.  \n\nYou can't say stuff like that and NOT be the asshole.", "ESH\n\nMeh, you could have phrased it better.  You've been pregnant, you know what she is going thru. So can you imagine being completely dependent on others for everything?   I think that while you were very kind to allow her in - you resent it so you have less patience.  \n\nShe needs to be more understanding that you are doing for her and not be completely demanding.   She needs to look into (as others have said) WIC and Food Stamps.  So she has some autonomy to purchase some items that she wants.  Or talk to her mother/father and see about someone else maybe chipping in.\n\nMaybe together you can come up with a shelf or something either in the pantry or in her room - out of site/reach of the kids and she could keep the stuff there.  You simply have a talk with your kids that while their aunt is pregnant, cravings, feelings, emotions and that just because the stuff is in the house, it's only for her, for only those reasons.", "Yta. The way you said it was rude and harsh. I get your sister is a mess right now but you talking to her like that isnt going to help anything.

See above all the people on chemo or who have HG who are encouraged by their doctors to eat ANYTHING they can keep down. During one period with my illness, they sent me to a nutritionist, and they gave me a pamphlet that's usually given to cancer and late-stage AIDS patients. It said to add whipped cream, butter, or bacon to EVERYTHING. Recs from a *nutritionist*...\n\nOther people propose excluding prepared foods in the freezer section or \"luxury\" foods like fish.

Nothing else was okay.

And you can have an \u201cagreement\u201d all you want but when a 3 month old baby is in danger of being homeless the situation may change. \n\nIf she\u2019s home all day doing nothing she needs to apply for all the public assistance NOW so it\u2019s in place and look into exactly  what needs to happen to file for child support so all her ducks are in a row.\n\nReframe this whole situation as a motivator. Maybe if you saw her working to better the situation you\u2019d be more willing to accommodate her requests.", "> Hopefully she will get child support.\n\nBased on your responses, you seem like seem to have 'ostrich-like' tendencies (i.e., putting your hand in the sand to ignore reality).\n\nIt's all very well to wave your hands in the air and vaguely hope that SIL gets enough money to be out of your hair in 3 months after she gives birth. But SIL clearly does not seem capable of putting her life in order, so your hope that SIL will somehow get it together seems wildly optimistic. So optimistic it is bordering on naive.\n\nThe reality of throwing out SIL and her newborn baby may not have a large impact on you, but it will definitely have a large impact on her brother -- your husband. Look how conflicted your husband is right now. While your husband may not be fond of his sister, it is a whole other ball of wax to expect him to put his sister and and her newborn baby out on the street.\n\nYou, your husband, and your SIL need to sit down and have a concrete plan. In writing. Figure it out step by step: \n\n- when will SIL start to get child support? how much?\n\n- where does SIL plan to live? does she have the first and last put away?\n\n- what type of social assistance will SIL apply for? has she started the process of applying for it? if not, why not?\n\n- when exactly will SIL be leaving your home? \n\n- what is SIL's expectations for childcare prior to leaving your home? does she expect you and your husband to help out? if yes, what type of help does she expect from you (you need to manage her expectations now)?\n\nIt is easy enough to claim now that you and your husband will be strong enough to throw SIL and her baby out. But if you can't even get SIL to act rational now about something relatively inconsequential as junk food, if you and your husband do not have the wisdom to draw hard boundaries with her now vis-a-vis making concrete plans for her departure, what chance do you have after the baby is here and things are much more complicated?!\n\nYou are going to be in for the ride of your life.
