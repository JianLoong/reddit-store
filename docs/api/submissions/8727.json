Yes, I know she's high-risk but there's a limit to how much leeway she should be allowed to get. You were harsh but right - you're NOT her partner or parent to her child, and she has to stand on her own eventually. You cannot and should not cater to her forever. Also, you have your own family to take care of too. I suggest you have a proper talk with your husband about this, then lay out some set house rules and boundaries, or you might all burn out and grow bitter at each other.

Yes, pregnancy sucks, it's hard, it's painful (I hated it both times).  I had cravings - which I usually solved on my trips to the grocery store.  Cravings for me weren't fleeting, with the first one it was dairy and protein (chicken liver pate, ugh), the second one was heat (Mexican food for the most part).  I would grab a bunch of those.  Bacon made me nauseous even though I love bacon.  didn't buy bacon, bought the thing I knew I would HAVE TO HAVE.\n\nthe one thing I had with both was diet Coke slurpies from 7-11.

Her cravings are unreasonable for her financial situation. Perhaps you all could meet in the middle with a small budget for craving foods that she can eat in her room only so the kids aren't all eyes and questions. Not sure of your area, but I would think $5-$10 a week or something small for pre-made baked goods or candy or something that would keep well in her room might not break the bank and would help a bit to ease the tension between her cravings and your wallet and sanity. She also needs to get it together on the stuff she's going to need for the baby and start applying to every program she can find. Diapers, clothes, cribs, bottles,  strollers etc all seem to be getting more expensive by the day and she needs to find a way to prepare for that baby without even thinking about your wallet. You might be able to provide some hand me downs but that can only go so far. Good luck, I hope things work out for you all.", "NTA - She needs to create a plan to take care of her whims and requests. Start with getting on nutritional assistance paired with doctor visits and a nutritionist. \n\nNow is the perfect time for her to learn strategy, self resiliency and responsibility.

You already feel put upon in life, because you have a diabetic child and your two picky kids each have a sweet tooth, so you're already spending more time on food as a task than you expected.\n\nAnd here she is, not liking anything you make, wanted to be waited upon and have you spend money for junk food, and you don't even like her.\n\nLook, you don't have to be noble all the time. Serving people when you resent it, is something that should be very, very limited, because you all end up feeling like garbage. You need a new plan and to get out of this role, while also hopefully not turning your SIL out on the street. How can she stay there without you being so involved and responsible for her? Brainstorm.\n\nSit down with your husband and ask him what he thinks his sister should do about her situation if there were no YOU to take care of her. Make a literal list. Where would housing, food, medicine, things for the baby come from? Then start making that list, because you are not here for this, for one second longer than you have to be. If there is any way to get her settled and provided for, somewhere else, you'd better do it in the next two months because there is NO way you are moving her out with a 3mo.\n\nYou said she's 6mo pregnant and you plan for her to be out when the baby is 3 months. My god. You think a woman coming off of a high risk pregnancy with a newborn is going to heal, regain strength from resting so much, take care of that newborn, find a place to live, get a full-time, living-wage JOB, and save first, last, deposit, etc., and be able to afford food, medicine, diapers, formula, childcare? Delusional.\n\nFind the aid now. Make the plan now, but even with a better head start, you're probably going to have her and her baby in your home for more like a year to 18 months at best, unless she finds a boyfriend or something. There are people right now working for YEARS to save up to get into an apartment, and/or to find a job that will cover rent, without also coming off a high risk pregnancy and taking care of a newborn! So unless somebody's got a money tree, if you are making a commitment to her, it's going to be for longer than baby's 3mo birthday.\n\nAs you are starting to find aid, very clearly right now, the food thing is at the top of your list. Get the SNAP, WIC, whatever she is eligible for. And when she obtains food for herself with those resources, keep your kids out of it. Family meals that you cook, can be whatever you make, and try not to begrudge her a plate. There is no reason for you to cook special foods or go to the Dairy Queen.", "NTA. You are not obligated to spend money outside of your budget so she can eat junk food. Pregnant women don\u2019t NEED junk food.

The three adults need to sit down and figure out what SIL being part of the household is going to look like, what is allowed and what isn\u2019t, etc. Because both of you are on course for major resentment which is going to impact your mental health, your children, and your marriage. NAH.", "NAH. You are kind to open your home to her and support her, but you need to set boundaries. It seems you are willing to spend some money on food for her, why not decide on the exact amount and give it to her so she can shop on her own? Is she receiving food stamps?", "ESH. Her demands are not reasonable, but rather than discussing it as adults you chose to lash out at a hormonal, pregnant single mom to be.\n\nHave a rational discussion tomorrow and set some boundaries. Make it clear what you will do or not do. Be accommodating to what is reasonable.\n\nAnd your husband sucks too for not de-escalating the situation.", "YTA.  The boundaries you set are 100% reasonable, and you are a generous soul for taking her in -- and the way you delivered the information was needlessly cruel.\n\nIt's always a two-edged sword when someone posts a solid position that is communicated heartlessly, but the question isn't, \"Have I placed my boundary at the right distance?\", but \"Am I The Asshole?\"  \n\nShe might be a user who takes a mile if you give her an inch, but you can set the boundary without making her feel like what she is:  unwanted, unloved, vulnerable, in dangerously bad health, broke, scared, and dependent on people who are making it abundantly clear that she is an unwelcome burden.  What's going to happen when the baby comes?  \n\nWhen she asks for things, all you have to say is, \"No.\"  You don't have to explain yourself, but if you want to, you can phrase it as courteously and compassionately as you did in your post:  \"I totally get the nausea, but making meals that both of my kids will eat without complaint is hard enough.\"\n\nBringing her kid's father into it was quite the low blow.  \n\nYou can't say stuff like that and NOT be the asshole.", "ESH\n\nMeh, you could have phrased it better.  You've been pregnant, you know what she is going thru. So can you imagine being completely dependent on others for everything?   I think that while you were very kind to allow her in - you resent it so you have less patience.  \n\nShe needs to be more understanding that you are doing for her and not be completely demanding.   She needs to look into (as others have said) WIC and Food Stamps.  So she has some autonomy to purchase some items that she wants.  Or talk to her mother/father and see about someone else maybe chipping in.\n\nMaybe together you can come up with a shelf or something either in the pantry or in her room - out of site/reach of the kids and she could keep the stuff there.  You simply have a talk with your kids that while their aunt is pregnant, cravings, feelings, emotions and that just because the stuff is in the house, it's only for her, for only those reasons.", "Yta. The way you said it was rude and harsh. I get your sister is a mess right now but you talking to her like that isnt going to help anything.

Keep in mind I\u2019m seeing this from the outside - and after going through two high risk pregnancies with my wife I understand.  Believe me.  That shit sucked.  But I kept reminding myself how much more it sucked for her.", "Some people never learn to cook despite having kids. My sister actively refused to learn when my mom tried to teach us and now my niblings eat mostly processed / packaged stuff and takeout unless my mom is able to make something for them.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking too.  I also want to know what\u2019s so high risk that she sits on her ass all day and doesn\u2019t cook her own food?  OP NTA here.", "Welp, if he wants to go back on the boundaries we agreed on then she will have to move put when we sell the house in the divorce", "No you're fooling yourself if you think people will put up with a moocher for that long", "She has some money in savings that should be enough to get herself a place once she can work again. Hopefully she will get child support. Mone of these things are our problem, this was what she came to us with and what we agreed on.", "We actually do have it in writing as a month to month and with a move out date.", "That isn't our problem. She was homeless, we told her what we were willing to do, its up to her to figure the rest out.", "She's not, don't know why, but she isn't, and I'm not going to push it with her. We've told her she needs to.", "Or I just don't want to deal with it in my house, especially since 1 is diabetic.", "She can eat what ever she wants if she pays for it, but I'm not paying for it.", "It is acceptable her house her rules, doesn't contribute in any way.\n\nOP should really dump her on her inlaws door it's their kid she has her own to raise", "Ok, but you are her husband and the father of her child, so yeah, of course you worry about her. That's the point. This isn't pur child or pur pregnancy. We didn't want her to move it, but she was homeless and kept begging us so we gave in. \n\nAnd yes, I expect her to control her behavior, pregnancy isn't the free pass some women think it is.", "If you can't cook basic meals, then you fail at adulting - and parenting, if you got kids. Of course, I'm not talking about 5-course dinners but you should at least be able to heat up some soup, make a simple stir-fry on a pan, etc. Anything less is just plain irresponsible.", "Op stated in a comment she doesn\u2019t know how/doesn\u2019t like to. So basically she is choosing not to", "As long as you're willing to do that. It sounds like a lot of unhappiness ahead. I'm sorry--it sounds like you and your husband were trying to be generous.", "Depends on if OP's husband decides to grow a spine or not.", "Good. Make sure it's properly signed, dated, and up-to-date.", "Perfect.", "Makes no difference what's in writing if your husband won't back it up and then you'll have to evict her. Can't think many judges would be okay with making an infant move to a shelter. Sorry OP, you're SOL.", "NTA - but if you don\u2019t push it, then what\u2019s the solution? Is this situation indefinite? What\u2019s the plan once her baby arrives?\n\nLike what other plans or contingencies is she making for herself and her child going forward, because this seems long term..", "What? Push it with her. Good grief.", "Does your husband contribute financially to your household? In fact, how much percentage-wise does he contribute to the household? She's his guest too, in fact, it can be argued she's his guest more than yours. You can keep your personal money to yourself, but the household budget isn't your personal money to use to exact a petty vendetta on a pregnant family member you dislike. \n\nI'm getting strong malicious compliance vibes from you; you couldn't say no to accepting SIL into your (shared) home but you'll absolutely die on dumb hills like not taking a pregnant lady's taste into account for communal meals and dishonestly hide behind some lame excuse about your children when she asks for separate snacks. Your children can be told that she's pregnant; that's not the problem. \n\nYou just enjoy making her uncomfortable in this, for you, petty way, and probably hope on some level you'll drive her to look for other accommodation and/or negatively impact her relationship with her brother. You don't like her but he loves her; get over it.", "Our mom really tried but she'd literally have a toddler meltdown and flee the house. She tried to complain about how she doesn't know how to cook to our mom once and mom pretty much told her to shove it lol. I did everything I could to learn cooking from the adults in my life and it's now one of my favorite things to do!", "He isn't the biggest fan of her here either, so I do trust that he will stick to what we agreed on, but truthfully if he didn't, that would be a problem for me because it would screw up my trust in him.", "She just says she can't right now and gets mad and then she crys and says we are stressing her out.", "This is absolutely what's going on here!", "Pregnant lady who is to lazy to do any cooking or even  get herself on food stamps? Fuck her", "Your sister sounds exhausting... you win this round.", "Unfortunately, I'm sure that's going to be difficult for him.\nFamily--the other F word.", "She's throwing tantrums, and it's only going to get worse. Stay firm with her."]}
