Your other comments make you sound bitter af.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like you answered either of my questions.  \n\n1) Are you expecting your brother to watch all four children while he works from home?\n\n2) What is the relationship between you, Mike, and Phillip.  Not between your children and their cousins.", "Exactly what I thought", "I'm newish to Reddit, is there a way to filter comments to see OPs or is it just a case of reading all to find them?", "You chose to have children. Now you feel entitled to free babysitting!? It sounds like jealousy on some level. Take care of your own children with your spouse. No one is obligated to babysit them.\n\nEdit: I misread the post and thought the scooter belonged to OOP\u2019s kid when that was not the case. Correction is appreciated. Took that part out.", "OP is resentful of an 8yo child.

My nephew was hard, and I love him dearly. He was the type of little kid that I had to literally pee with the door open a crack and cut it off mid-stream because I heard broken glass (folks with hard kids will know EXACTLY what I mean by that). \n\nLater, when he was around 8, a famiwith 5 kids moved in across the street. The came and went from my house like it was their second house, and at one point, all 5 of them were drawing in my living room, quiet as mice. I had a moment where I thought \u201cOmg. All 5 of these children together are easier to babysit than my nephew\u201d. I didn\u2019t feel terrible, it was just facts. Maybe OP needs to assess how much energy is required for their children vs the other relatives.", "OP, YTA. Plus, u/liracs-roses-sunsets said, \"on your day off\". You and your wife must have days offs. Use those days to help the cousins to grow together on your watch. Unless your children are as entitled as you are. Phil's children don't deserve to be punished for being near a household of entitled people. I truly hope your children are much better human beings than you.", "I really feel bad for your kids if you seriously lack this much common sense.", "Please don't have any more kids", "You're absolutely hilarious.

Was this a one time request or like daily?", "So you and Phil take turns looking after all 4 at once. As you said- not much harder to babysit 4 than 2. And it means that when you do get some time without the kids it'll be because you're equitably contributing to the village you expect to help you raise your kids, instead of just presuming you can spend your CF Brother's social resources on his behalf.\n\nYTA.", "Yes, same as your brother. This just can't be real.", "You sound very entitled and demanding. \n\nHe doesn't owe you shit and I'm glad he's not doing it because your attitude sucks", "maybe the most choosing beggar thing i\u2019ve seen on this sub. wow.

It might have something to do with that god awful entitled attitude of yours.

I'd watch my relative's kids for free, but not if they acted like you.

Your brother owes nothing to either of his siblings and I can see why he is not keen on helping you specifically.\n\nHe probably knows how entitled you are and knows that if he helps you at all your kids will be with him constantly.", "Why? Your other brother and his children might be a lot easier to be around/less entitled to other people's resources than you and yours. Might be a nice time to reflect on if that's the case and fix it if so.\n\nEither way he owes both of you nothing. Choosing to do a favor for one sibling doesn't negate that.", "Why should he? They\u2019re your kids, you chose to have them.

Good job helping your case here lmao", "Troll troll troll", "So, he can't make decisions about HIS time because he is childfree?", "Gotcha! Thanks for the clarification!", "Judging from OP's comments, I would say it is a very definite possibility that OP's kids are not a joy to be around if they are anything like OP. OP is very entitled, demanding and can't take no for an answer.
