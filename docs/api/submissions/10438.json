Before they came over, I texted them to find out if any of them had any food sensitivities, allergies, needs, etc. The wife said there was nothing I needed to worry about. \n\nI decided on something a bit kid friendly while still feeling like I was cooking for adults so I settled on chicken parm with some chocolate cake for dessert. I figured it's like chicken nuggets mixed with pizza, which kids would like. It turned out really well for someone who's just started cooking like me. My friends were telling me that it was good, and maybe they were just being polite, but they ate everything. Charlie poked at her meal the entire time we were eating and I'm not sure she ate any of it. After we were done, I brought out the chocolate cake. Charlie ate a tiny bite and immediately started bawling. Sandra asked her what was wrong and she cried that she didn't like chocolate. Sandra continued to comfort her daughter while Mike and I awkwardly ate dessert. \n\nA couple of minutes pass and I notice Sandra is glaring at me. I hesitantly asked her if I could help her with Charlie. I'm not good with kids, which she knows, but I wasn't sure what else to do. She huffed and asked, \"Is there anything you'd like to say to Charlie?\" It took me a second to realize that she wanted an apology for her kid not eating my food. I thought it might help cheer Charlie up at least, so I said I was sorry that she didn't like my food. Charlie started crying harder and her mom asked me if I had anything she would like instead. I drew the line there. I told her that I wasn't going to cook anything else, and that if I didn't like what my mom made me as a kid, I went to bed hungry. Mike is just silently eating his cake while Sandra tried to convince me to make something else from for Charlie to eat. \n\nI stood up from the table and asked Mike if he would like me to wrap up his cake for him to take home because the rest of his family was apparently not having a good time. I suggested that Sandra could go home and make something for Charlie to eat. Sandra scoffed at me and said something about how I was cooking tonight and she thought she could have taken the night off. I knew I was about to say something I really regretted, so I slammed my plate on the table and told her to get out. Mike seemed genuinely embarrassed as they left. I haven't spoken to any of them since and now I'm thinking I overreacted by kicking them out of my house.\n\nEDIT: This happened about 3 days ago and I'm going to reach out to Mike today when it's not 4 AM.

NTA your friend Sandra is the ass", "NTA\nYou reached out prior to the dinner.  9 year old picky kid can eat when she gets home.  Sandra was out of line", "NTA. If their kid was that picky of an eater they should have brought food for her and told you not to worry. Also the mom sounds HUGELY entitled and is doing her kid no favours for their future expecting everyone to cater to their needs. Good for you for having boundaries - honestly sounds like you handled it well.", "NTA, you purposefully asked Dandra about food preferences, she listed non. How can she make you apologize to the kid for her own pickiness and her mom's lack of thought?\nAsking you to cook another meal is so over the  head. They could've ordered takeout if it's such a big issue.", "NTA.\n\nI have a picky eater. If my child doesn't eat what's there, I'll feed her something at home. No harm, no foul. I do generally suggest what we can eat but I don't make the hosts feel bad if she won't eat.", "NTA\n\nSandra set you up.  If her kid's a picky eater (please only cook her white things sprinkled lightly with oregano you buy at 6 a.m. at the farmers market smothered in organic katsup you import from France type picky) she needed to tell you.  Then she needed to bring the white stuff & oregano & heat it up herself.\n\nOr she needed to quickly apologize TO YOU & ask if would be OK if she nipped into the kitchen and hard boiled her kid an egg or made her a PBJ.\n\nBut what she didn't get to do is manipulate you to apologize.  For what?  Because her kid's a picky eater and she set you up and she's a truly dreadful mother and a worse guest?\n\nP.S.  Next time, do try to hold it together.  As in \"Gosh, since little Charlie doesn't like anything I've cooked and chocolate cake is so upsetting to her and I don't have a single other thing to offer, you probably want to race right out the door & rush home instantly so you can fix her something.  I'll get your coat.\"", "NTA\n\nSandra knew Charlie was a picky eater and should have given you a heads up on what she would and wouldn't eat. Or, she could've brought something she knew Charlie would eat to save you the trouble.

Expecting you to go whip up something else is entitled and extremely rude. \n\nThe fact that a 9 year old cried about not liking chocolate cake is also bizarre for me. Being able to politely say \u201cno thank you\u201d sounds like a lesson Charlie probably missed because her mom was too busy making her new meals. \n\nPS  kudos on doing all this while you\u2019re still new to cooking! It sounded delicious!", "NTA.  The entitlement of Sandra is astounding.  She didn\u2019t parent her child correctly and expect others to cater to her entitled ass and child.  The dinner you made sounds great.", "NTA - firstly, the kid is NINE not a toddler. Kid is old enough to politely try some of the food even if its unfamiliar.\nSecondly, Sandra said there was nothing you needed to worry about. Not \"she doesn't like chocolate cake?\"\nSo if me or my friends are feeding each others kids, the person hosting will say \"I'm planning to cook X, is that a problem?\" and the other person would say yes/no/kid is fussy about whatever - beforehand.

Get her a sandwich or some flakes, not a private chef.   \nPoor Mike.", "NTA, I also grew up with the \"Eat what we cooked, our don't eat at all\" rule. Not saying that's right or wrong, but what is wrong is to expect someone else to accommodate your child. If Sandra wanted Charlie to have something else to eat it was up to her to provide it, no you.", "NTA\n\nIf they didn't tell you about any food issues then what you prepared sounds fine. You made an effort to make it kid friendly!\n\nIf she knew her kid was fussy then she should have said something earlier or bought her own food with her.\n\nI would have offered some toast or fruit to the kid...I am not sure what else you could have done?", "NTA her kid, her problem.

Mike ignored the unfolding situation and shovelled your good food into his mouth. Not a great day in the annals of parenting.\n\nInstead of helping, Sandra doubled down by reinforcing and rewarding her child's crappy behaviour with drama (ooo!) and silly, unreasonable demands. I'm glad to see that you modelled decent boundaries and didn't play along. But then Sandra kept pushing...\n\nAnger is a predictable response to being disrespected or pushed too far.

Let Charlie have them. *They made her what she is,* so they deserve her and everything she's gonna dish out. (Too bad *SuperNanny* is no longer filming, they'd be stars!)\n\nIn this rare case, NTA and good riddance.

What kid of parenting are these people doing by appeasing that behavior.", "NTA and any person here stating you had any fault in the matter is completely wrong and you need to stop apologizing on their behalf. This entire generation of people who believe the world revolves around them are in a word: entitled. Entitlement deserves nothing in regards to respect. Your home, your cooking, THEIR child! I can\u2019t even imagine the horror that child will be later in life. I\u2019d cut these people out of my life if I were you. How ignorant of some people to say you suck for your response. Wow!!! So you\u2019re supposed to take being spit on and demeaned with a smile on your face?

Feels like they should be doing that for their whiny pampered 9 year old.", "NTA\n\nYou did not over-react.  They didn't say there was anything to worry about in terms of food preferences.   If their kid was a picky eater, they should have said so upfront.  Then you could have made something simple and quick like a grilled cheese when you were cooking.\n\nBasically, they are the AHs because they did not clearly communicate any menu preferences up front.  Then were mad that their kid didn't have anything the kid liked.  Which, again, **they did not tell you beforehand**.   \n\nHowever, I think these people probably won't be your friends going forward.  Good riddance, from how they acted.", "NTA. You asked upfront if there was anything to keep in mind. There wasn\u2019t any. \n\nChildren may or may not like dinner. That\u2019s fine. They still need to learn certain tastes. If I knew my child was such a picky eater I would have brought my own food for my child. Or told the hosts she likes certain foods.\n\n I don\u2019t agree nor disagree with the you eat the food or you go to bed hungry rule. It is a certain parenting style. As a grown up I have certain foods I don\u2019t like (not a lot) and wouldn\u2019t want anyone to force me eating it. So I don\u2019t really think forcing children will get the good results and it is not a lot of fun at the table. But there are so many other options here. Only apologizing to this child is not one of them. That is just weird. OP, you did your best to accomodate this family and the mother was plain rude to you. There were many more options she could have chosen to do. But did this instead. So NTA.

If she knows her kid is a picky eater she either should have given her dinner at home or at the very least gave you a heads up when you asked. NTA.", "NTA As others have said, your reaction was a bit much and you could\u2019ve handled it better, but I can see how Sandra\u2019s behavior drove you there. You were not wrong - she was and she is going to raise a spoiled, entitled brat if she keeps on behaving like this.", "NTA good lord you weren\u2019t hired as a cook for the evening. Sandra should have asked Charlie to apologize and be patient and wait to eat something else at home. Sounds like Mike is also failing to step up and lay down boundaries with his wife and daughter.", "NTA\n\nIf we're invited to dinner with our kids, I take food they like as backup. They might eat what's on offer (usually more likely while out than at home TBH) or they will have what I have taken, sometimes both depending on how hungry they are! I never expect a host to cater to my kids!", "NTA - Yes, you could have handled it a little more gracefully and throwing them out was a bit harsh. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s ridiculous from Sandra a) to have you apologize and b) to expect you to cater to Charlie\u2019s needs. You clearly served edible food, otherwise the plates would have not been polished.\n\nAlso, if Sandra and Mike already know that Charlie is a picky eater, it\u2019s on them to bring suitable food. Especially if Charlie was \u201cinconsolable\u201d, it was on them to call the evening short. Thank you for the meal and to head out. \n\nAnother option for them would be to stop somewhere on the way home to get Charlie something (though I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a great pedagogical idea)", "I come from a culture where hospitality is very valued, and my goal in your situation would be to make sure nobody leaves hungry haha. Kids can be weird lol, if the kid didn't like what I made I'd immediately offer something else like a piece of bread with butter, or literally anything I had just in the fridge. Nobody would expect you to cook a whole other meal for the kid but just offering something else the kid would want to eat is just normal to me. Your response sounds so extreme to me haha. But I understand we are not all the same. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom was way out of line with wanting you to apologize to her kid lol. And also if she just asked you if you had anything else the kid could eat, that would be ok, but demanding it and complaining that \"this was her night off from cooking\" is crazy to me hahaha, idk what these people have in their heads.\n\nI'd say NTA, the moms reaction sounded absurd. But learn from this and keep in mind that this is how dinners with kids can go, so maybe you'll also want to respond differently next time this happens.", "In this situation, it seems that both parties could have handled things better. While the host did try to accommodate any dietary restrictions beforehand, the child's dislike of the meal is not the host's fault. However, it may have been helpful for the host to have some alternative options available or suggest that the child could eat something else they may have brought with them.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest's request for a second meal and expectation that the host would cater to their child's preferences may have been unreasonable. It also seems that the guest was overly critical and confrontational towards the host, which escalated the situation.\n\nOverall, it's understandable that the host felt frustrated and upset with the guest's behavior, but kicking them out of the house may not have been the most productive solution. It may be worth reaching out to the couple to apologize for the heated exchange and try to find a way to move forward in a more positive manner", "ESH - you because you slammed your plate down and asked them to leave, you should have stayed calm and just said there was nothing else for dessert and then it would have been N-T-A, Sandra was being inappropriate and a rude and unappreciative guest by expecting you to cook something else for Charlie because she didn't like the cake.", "Sandra is a lunatic", "NTA. Nine years old and she\u2019s having tantrums about food?! If the parents are going to bring a kid with that kind of food issues over, the LEAST they could have done is sheepishly tell you ahead of time, \u201cUnfortunately Charlie eats only macaroni and cheese and vanilla cake, would you mind making a box of Annie\u2019s?\u201d Or they could\u2019ve brought food for the kid. In no way should you have been expected to produce another meal or dessert on command.", "NTA, my kids still a toddler but I always try to bring something with to family dinners for her in case she decides to get picky. That's the parents responsibility not yours.", "NTA. Absolutely not. This is next level entitlement. The kid is old enough to be told not to have a meltdown over this.

If I think what will be served might not be to my kids or my own liking, we pre eat or plan to stop on the way home. Quite recently I did that and then what was served to me was so good I regretted it!\n\nAlso, you asked if they have any food issues - not liking chocolate is something I would always mention because while chocolate desserts are virtually standard, it's also just as easy to make something non chocolate if you know.", "NTA but maybe you could have offered to make the kid a sandwich, just to keep the peace.", "NTA. If Sandra suspected her child might have trouble eating somewhere, the onus was on her to take the opportunity offered to tell you her kid doesn\u2019t like chocolate, won\u2019t eat certain textures, etc. Hell, at the very LEAST she could have asked you what you planned to make and if she knew her kid wouldn\u2019t eat it, brought something from home!\n\nDemanding you APOLOGIZE then cook her kid a whole new meal because she failed to inform you what her kid would eat is appalling. No wonder Mike just sat there in silence, I\u2019d have been humiliated if my spouse acted like this.\n\nMaybe reach out to Mike and ONLY Mike.

My kids are picky (4.5 and 2) and you know what? They either eat what\u2019s in front of them in public or don\u2019t eat. They know they don\u2019t get to complain.", "This exact crap is why I stopped hosting dinner parties. NTA. I don't think you over reacted personally. She was out of line asking you to apologize and you did it anyway. You suggested them leaving because of obvious reasons and Sandra got rude and snappy. I honestly don't understand why they didn't get up to leave as soon as the daughter started crying. \n\nLook my little brother ate five foods for like fifteen years but there wasn't crying or tantrums. He would just not eat if someone couldn't accommodate him.", "Holy hell! The parents I know are not this entitled, they are also a lot more reasonable thankfully. Usually my friends always keep some snacks in their kiddie go bag just in case their kid is being fussy. \n\nYou are definitely NTA. That woman was way entitled and a pain and what was up with the dad?! Just sitting there doing and saying nothing lol. Also the kid is 9, yeah I get they can be cranky but I thought at that age you can expect some manners.", "Um\u2026what??? This is insane. What kind of person would behave like this? Sandra sounds like she has never participated in society before. That is how out of line and embarrassing her actions were. And sadly she is raising an entitled brat of a child. My biggest question though is where was Mike in all of this? Is he the one you are friends with or you\u2019re friends with Sandra also? The whole thing seems odd because I mean how could this be the first socially inept behavior from Sandra? Is there really no track record?", "NTA chicken parm and chocolate cake is super tame all things considered. Not like you made a spicy curry or steak tartare or anything like that. You asked, they answered, their fault for lying.", "My SIL came to my house once with her kids and I offered to make Spaghetti. She said that was fine. It was not. She ended up almost taking over my kitchen to make 5 different spaghettis. \n\nI couldn't use onions in my sauce... that's fine because a lot of people are picky about onions. One kid got noodles and sauce straight out of the jar. Two kids had frozen meatballs she brought to cook. Only one kid had the actual spaghetti that I made once I was allowed to combine my noodles and the meat sauce I made. It took an hour to make an easy 30 minute meal. \n\nThe next time I just made chicken nuggets and fries. They started complaining that the ketchup was bad. It was in date and tasted fine to me and my husband. I heard about this ketchup for years. \n\nI no longer cook for her kids.", "ESH\n\n\nYou asked about food issues and they didn't speak up for whatever reason.\n\nWas the kid having a bad day?? Or is their child on the spectrum and your friends didn't want to say anything?? 9 is old enough to communicate ..so the crying concerns me.\n\n\nYou had every right to refuse and kick them out. Yelling and slamming dishes was an ahole thing especially in front of a child that was the cause of the upset in the first place. I can only imagine how the kid felt after that happened.\n\nGiven Mike's reaction...this can't be an isolated issue. Try reaching out to him first and see what he has to say......", "NTA.\n\nSandra is so out of line, she doesn't see \"the line\".

Not the person that is hosting you especially after OP asked! This is absurd and Sandra sounds entitled. Golly!", "My son doesn't like chocolate cake. He doesn't really like sweets. But I would have communicated that. I don't understand why the mom wasn't more helpful when OP asked about food issues. Maybe the kid just said I don't like chocolate for attention.", "Yeah, I have never heard a kid say that they didn't like chocolate", "the ones so spoiled that will make a fuss for the sake of it. she likely liked it but he was too upset to be willing to admit it. that's what you get when you spoil kids that much", "In fairness some kids don\u2019t like sweets and get sick eating them- chocolate can be a big trigger for that (hubs was similar as a kid). Kiddo in this story is 9, a little older than expected, but think of it this way. She doesn\u2019t like the food but is trying at the start to be polite about it by saying nothing, but by the time that cake rolls out she\u2019s hangry, she\u2019s upset, and boom\u2026 tears. Tears made worse by her mother getting riled up and that in turn riles her up. I\u2019ve worked with kids most of my life and this scenario honestly doesn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest. I\u2019d hesitate to blame or mock her in this instance: a rude or spoiled or entitled child would have IMMEDIATELY started complaining/whining about the food, not sat there quietly trying to still eat at least SOMETHING despite their discomfort", "Hopefully I'll never be in this situation again, but that's a good tip to have in my back pocket", "Thanks! I knew I liked what I cook, so it's vindicating when other people do too.", "I was admittedly pretty shocked. I don't know squat about kids, but I figured 9 would have been old enough to handle this differently. Maybe she just got hangry.", "I mentioned in another comment that I'm unlearning a lot of things about anger and while not ideal, this was still better than I would have done years ago. I'm sure I'll do better next time.", "I was trying to follow mom's lead on it, but she apparently didn't know what was going to make it better for her kid either", "I'm just hoping that this was out of character for her and that's why Sandra didn't handle it well, but I'm not holding my breath.", "Charlie is NINE", "Charlie is 9...!! That makes it even worse..", "I think they have a point, though. There were more graceful ways to handle this that I just didn't employ. I'm working to have healthier ways to express anger and I can acknowledge that I still have work to do.", "I'm just speculating at this point, but part of why they came over is because they don\u2019t get out much and so maybe they weren't in that exact situation before to head it off", "I appreciate that. I'm unlearning a lot of bad habits around anger and while this wasn't a great way to handle it, it's better than I would have done in the past.", "Yeah bizarre behavior by the parents here to not think of their child. I thought it was standard procedure to bring along a Tupperware of something you know the kid will probably eat just in case they\u2019re being picky.", "I'm American for reference and for sure, we don't have that same hospitality culture as a standard. Unfortunately, I didn't actually have much that a kid would have liked. Since I started cooking, I stopped buying prepackaged ready to eat stuff since it's not as healthy. I would have had to cook something from scratch, I think.", "That haha is the oddest haha paragraph, I have haha ever deciphered lol. Haha", "I'm certainly not proud of the way I handled it and I'm trying to use it as a learning experience going forward.", "Yeah, it definitely wasn't one of my finest moments", "I don't think the kid is on the spectrum, at least Sandra has never said anything about it.\n\nIt wasn't my best moment. I don't want to defend what I did because it was still shitty, but I think the crying was getting to me. I don't want kids because I can't handle the sound of kids crying.", "I suppose you are th\u00e9 winner there\u2026 more cake for you :)", "I don't like chocolate cake. Not now, not when I was a kid. But my mother would NEVER have allowed me to act so spoiled!", "NTA. I mean some don't care for it. But crying? Ridiculous, Heck when my nephew was three he'd just say no thanks or maybe eat a very tiny piece.", "I despise chocolate in any form---always have.  I can't even stand the smell.  But when I was a kid I'd just say \"no thank you\" (as my mother taught me!)", "I never liked cake at all as a kid... I just said no thank you, nbd.", "She's 9! If she was 4 or 5 I would agree. But 9 is too old for that kind of behaviour.", "Oh good.  I hope it's clear that I completely support you kicking them out, but I want you to do it without breaking a sweat.  And without giving them cake to go.", "The only thing I would have done differently (if you decided to ever try again) is ask what kind of food the kid likes. But as a non-kid person, I understand why you didn't, so I'm not blaming. However, she knows her kid, and could have easily said \"no food allergies, but they like abc, doesn't like xyz\". Or, knowing that her kid is picky, brought something for them herself. My daughter was weird picky - no condiments or sauces of any kind on anything. As her mom, I would have made sure to mention that, or asked what you were planning so I could plan something else for her. Again, not blaming, because it wasn't your responsibility to know.", "My 9 year old is a picky eater, and anytime he\u2019s eating somewhere out the home, like his grandma takes him for a day out or we have been invited to have dinner somewhere, we ALWAYS make sure to say, he won\u2019t eat most things but here\u2019s what he will eat/drink. It\u2019s what you should be doing as a parent with a child that is fussy.", "There you go -- practice practice practice ;-) \n\nI'm just mad...that you wasted homemade chicken parm and chocolate cake on these silly, silly people. So! Ungrateful! Jeez! \n\nI would have brought you a nice red as a hostess prezzie AND washed every dish in the house for you afterwards!", "i had similar thing with couple of friends. helicopter mommy asked me to apologize to her kid (9) because i gave him a game he already had for the switch (poor communication with other guests, double gift)\n\ni said to the kid that was listening no reason \"please hand me back the gift and i will fix this *taking gift back* i will go to the shop, return it and donate the money in charity for orphans. you see, you could have asked gracefully for receipt and ask your mom to change it for some other. since you do not appreciate good things in life my gift for you is a lesson about values\"\n\n\nmother literally killed me with a glare to which i smiled \"you are welcome\"", "I honestly would not have picked up that I was supposed to apologize to Charlie, because seriously what the fuck is that?", "That\u2019s a very positive way to look at your own mentality but I would keep it as a lesson you\u2019ve learned for yourself. Narcissistic types do not compute in logical ways; you apologizing because you understand you reacted in a negative way is a very mature thing, however, apologizing will only fuel her egocentrism. Be smart while also being aware of the negative impact you could have when dealing with someone who just does not think the same way you do.", "OP most likely got a taste how dinner runs in their house. I think that\u2019s probably also the reason Sandra was so unnerved and Mike so passive.", "Yeah I get that. I still think it's not, let's say, convenient, to invite people over, especially a kid, and not be prepared for something that I think is pretty common with kids (to not like food you made). If I were you I'd try to prepare a bit better next time, just because I would personally want to be able to give something to the kid so they dont end up hungry in my house. But that's just me. And also just to be clear you're NTA, I'm just thinking of the ways you too can maybe improve for next time.", "NTA \n\nWhen my kids were small, I would NEVER expect someone to make a separate meal for my kids.   They would either eat what they were served or I would give them something when we got home.   Did you have pasta with the parm? Bread and butter?  Salad? If so, they could have had that.   Mom was rude and way out of line.  She is raising an entitled,  rude child who is too old for that behavior.", "Hospitality is out the window when the guest are treating your invite as a day off and then have the balls to complain and demand an apology. \nHospitality was offering the cake to go cause if I were you, they would be wearing the cake home.", "Oh was it that annoying? My apologies, it's really bad if the writting style of my comment overshadowed what was said in it", "quite the contrary, you should get more familiar in setting healthy boundaries", "We all make mistakes, if you get a chance maybe apologize to Mike for asking them to leave after things have cooled off and tell him you were shocked and didn't know how to handle being demanded by a guest to make new and different food after preparing a meal like this.  \n\nFrankly Charlie sounds like a handful and like her mom is grievously self-entitled and spoiling her rotten, if my son had not liked the food when I brought him somewhere it would not have occurred to me in a million years to demand they make a new and different meal for him.", "Why should OP apologize for reacting to blatant disrespect? This is victim blaming. Take a good look at yourself, turning the other cheek is an outdated way of controlling the masses. People should stand up to rude arrogance; if enough people stood their ground against entitlement we would evolutionarily remove this response from modern society. It will take time but everything is conditioning, don\u2019t allow these types of people to control the narrative!"]}
