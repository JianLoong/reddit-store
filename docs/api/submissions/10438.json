Before they came over, I texted them to find out if any of them had any food sensitivities, allergies, needs, etc. The wife said there was nothing I needed to worry about. \n\nI decided on something a bit kid friendly while still feeling like I was cooking for adults so I settled on chicken parm with some chocolate cake for dessert. I figured it's like chicken nuggets mixed with pizza, which kids would like. It turned out really well for someone who's just started cooking like me. My friends were telling me that it was good, and maybe they were just being polite, but they ate everything. Charlie poked at her meal the entire time we were eating and I'm not sure she ate any of it. After we were done, I brought out the chocolate cake. Charlie ate a tiny bite and immediately started bawling. Sandra asked her what was wrong and she cried that she didn't like chocolate. Sandra continued to comfort her daughter while Mike and I awkwardly ate dessert. \n\nA couple of minutes pass and I notice Sandra is glaring at me. I hesitantly asked her if I could help her with Charlie. I'm not good with kids, which she knows, but I wasn't sure what else to do. She huffed and asked, \"Is there anything you'd like to say to Charlie?\" It took me a second to realize that she wanted an apology for her kid not eating my food. I thought it might help cheer Charlie up at least, so I said I was sorry that she didn't like my food. Charlie started crying harder and her mom asked me if I had anything she would like instead. I drew the line there. I told her that I wasn't going to cook anything else, and that if I didn't like what my mom made me as a kid, I went to bed hungry. Mike is just silently eating his cake while Sandra tried to convince me to make something else from for Charlie to eat. \n\nI stood up from the table and asked Mike if he would like me to wrap up his cake for him to take home because the rest of his family was apparently not having a good time. I suggested that Sandra could go home and make something for Charlie to eat. Sandra scoffed at me and said something about how I was cooking tonight and she thought she could have taken the night off. I knew I was about to say something I really regretted, so I slammed my plate on the table and told her to get out. Mike seemed genuinely embarrassed as they left. I haven't spoken to any of them since and now I'm thinking I overreacted by kicking them out of my house.\n\nEDIT: This happened about 3 days ago and I'm going to reach out to Mike today when it's not 4 AM. Thanks for the perspective, everyone!\n\nEDIT 2: Thank you to everyone for sharing all these new perspectives on this situation. I truly appreciate them all (except the guy who told me to just not act angry next time). \n\nI reached out to Mike today to apologize for kicking them out. Mike apologized for everything. He said that Sandra's mother had been admitted to the hospital that day so understandably nobody was really on their best behavior. He said they drove straight from the hospital to my house. He said he would have said something about it, but Sandra had asked him not to mention it then so she could focus on dinner, which is totally fair. Charlie isn't normally a picky eater or spoiled or autistic or anything, she was just upset about grandma. Why she latched onto saying she didn't like chocolate is really anyone's guess. Sandra's mom is doing better now and while the family didn't behave at their best, I've got no hard feelings about dinner any more. Maybe they're lying, maybe not, but I'm willing to give the friendship one more chance, though I probably won't cook for them again.", "created_utc": 1676893249, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1174jk3/aita_for_not_making_a_second_meal_for_a_child/", "score": 12132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA your friend Sandra is the ass", "NTA\nYou reached out prior to the dinner.  9 year old picky kid can eat when she gets home.  Sandra was out of line", "NTA. If their kid was that picky of an eater they should have brought food for her and told you not to worry. Also the mom sounds HUGELY entitled and is doing her kid no favours for their future expecting everyone to cater to their needs. Good for you for having boundaries - honestly sounds like you handled it well.", "NTA, you purposefully asked Dandra about food preferences, she listed non. How can she make you apologize to the kid for her own pickiness and her mom's lack of thought?\nAsking you to cook another meal is so over the  head. They could've ordered takeout if it's such a big issue.", "NTA.\n\nI have a picky eater. If my child doesn't eat what's there, I'll feed her something at home. No harm, no foul. I do generally suggest what we can eat but I don't make the hosts feel bad if she won't eat.", "NTA\n\nSandra set you up.  If her kid's a picky eater (please only cook her white things sprinkled lightly with oregano you buy at 6 a.m. at the farmers market smothered in organic katsup you import from France type picky) she needed to tell you.  Then she needed to bring the white stuff & oregano & heat it up herself.\n\nOr she needed to quickly apologize TO YOU & ask if would be OK if she nipped into the kitchen and hard boiled her kid an egg or made her a PBJ.\n\nBut what she didn't get to do is manipulate you to apologize.  For what?  Because her kid's a picky eater and she set you up and she's a truly dreadful mother and a worse guest?\n\nP.S.  Next time, do try to hold it together.  As in \"Gosh, since little Charlie doesn't like anything I've cooked and chocolate cake is so upsetting to her and I don't have a single other thing to offer, you probably want to race right out the door & rush home instantly so you can fix her something.  I'll get your coat.\"", "NTA\n\nSandra knew Charlie was a picky eater and should have given you a heads up on what she would and wouldn't eat. Or, she could've brought something she knew Charlie would eat to save you the trouble. Sandra has a lot of audacity, expecting you to apologize for her child being picky is wild.", "NTA - you asked if there were any dietary restrictions or needs, and were very thoughtful to make things you thought would be appealing to a child. Expecting you to go whip up something else is entitled and extremely rude. \n\nThe fact that a 9 year old cried about not liking chocolate cake is also bizarre for me. Being able to politely say \u201cno thank you\u201d sounds like a lesson Charlie probably missed because her mom was too busy making her new meals. \n\nPS  kudos on doing all this while you\u2019re still new to cooking! It sounded delicious!", "NTA.  The entitlement of Sandra is astounding.  She didn\u2019t parent her child correctly and expect others to cater to her entitled ass and child.  The dinner you made sounds great.", "NTA - firstly, the kid is NINE not a toddler. Kid is old enough to politely try some of the food even if its unfamiliar.\nSecondly, Sandra said there was nothing you needed to worry about. Not \"she doesn't like chocolate cake?\"\nSo if me or my friends are feeding each others kids, the person hosting will say \"I'm planning to cook X, is that a problem?\" and the other person would say yes/no/kid is fussy about whatever - beforehand.

Get her a sandwich or some flakes, not a private chef.   \nPoor Mike.", "NTA, I also grew up with the \"Eat what we cooked, our don't eat at all\" rule. Not saying that's right or wrong, but what is wrong is to expect someone else to accommodate your child. If Sandra wanted Charlie to have something else to eat it was up to her to provide it, no you.", "NTA\n\nIf they didn't tell you about any food issues then what you prepared sounds fine. You made an effort to make it kid friendly!\n\nIf she knew her kid was fussy then she should have said something earlier or bought her own food with her.\n\nI would have offered some toast or fruit to the kid...I am not sure what else you could have done?", "NTA her kid, her problem.

Mike ignored the unfolding situation and shovelled your good food into his mouth. Not a great day in the annals of parenting.\n\nInstead of helping, Sandra doubled down by reinforcing and rewarding her child's crappy behaviour with drama (ooo!) and silly, unreasonable demands. I'm glad to see that you modelled decent boundaries and didn't play along. But then Sandra kept pushing...\n\nAnger is a predictable response to being disrespected or pushed too far. After a bunch of volleys, you got mad, which is embarrassing and why you're asking us if you went too far. \n\nJudgment: gotta say, you handled things flawlessly...right up to the point that you \"slammed a plate\" and \"told her to get out\", thus turning yourself into the crazy lady, see Mummy was right, none of this is Charlie's fault!\n\nNormally when you lose your temper, you lose.\n\n*However* in this case, all you lost was a \"friendship\" with two folks who are going to be preoccupied cleaning up their daughter's messes for the next 20 years or so. Let Charlie have them. *They made her what she is,* so they deserve her and everything she's gonna dish out. (Too bad *SuperNanny* is no longer filming, they'd be stars!)\n\nIn this rare case, NTA and good riddance.

Words fail me.", "NTA - the amount of disrespect they brought to your table is astonishing. you were wrong to apologize. poor innocent kid, life will be difficult for her if she cries in front of chocolate cake. not kid fault but bad parenting.\n\nanyhow i would never apologize for that. \"dear kiddo, not always we get things our way, please try to eat if you are hungry or wait to get home to have what you want. you cannot argue a gift, when you pay you can set conditions\"\n\n\nedit: i read my comment and found errors with pronous, i am sorry it was a mistake in good faith as not native eng speaker, not meant to offend anyone (correcting as i see them)", "NTA- i know it is but rude but don't invite her again, she is way too dramatic and disrespectful", "NTA \n\nThe second hand embarrassment I am feeling from this audacity!!!", "NTA, if that crazy asked me if I'd like to say anything to Chalie I'd of said. \"Charlie go pack up your toys and put on your shoes, it's time it go\".

What kid of parenting are these people doing by appeasing that behavior.", "NTA and any person here stating you had any fault in the matter is completely wrong and you need to stop apologizing on their behalf. This entire generation of people who believe the world revolves around them are in a word: entitled. Entitlement deserves nothing in regards to respect. Your home, your cooking, THEIR child! I can\u2019t even imagine the horror that child will be later in life. I\u2019d cut these people out of my life if I were you. How ignorant of some people to say you suck for your response. Wow!!! So you\u2019re supposed to take being spit on and demeaned with a smile on your face? NTA, ignore the underlying misogyny and victim blaming which is obviously happening in some of your comments.", "NTA.\n\nChicken Parm was a good choice.\n\nThe problem is the mom, 100%\n\nWhen we had a toddler, we'd carry backup food.  Feels like they should be doing that for their whiny pampered 9 year old.", "NTA\n\nYou did not over-react.  They didn't say there was anything to worry about in terms of food preferences.   If their kid was a picky eater, they should have said so upfront.  Then you could have made something simple and quick like a grilled cheese when you were cooking.\n\nBasically, they are the AHs because they did not clearly communicate any menu preferences up front.  Then were mad that their kid didn't have anything the kid liked.  Which, again, **they did not tell you beforehand**.   \n\nHowever, I think these people probably won't be your friends going forward.  Good riddance, from how they acted.", "NTA. You asked upfront if there was anything to keep in mind. There wasn\u2019t any. \n\nChildren may or may not like dinner. That\u2019s fine. They still need to learn certain tastes. If I knew my child was such a picky eater I would have brought my own food for my child. Or told the hosts she likes certain foods.\n\n I don\u2019t agree nor disagree with the you eat the food or you go to bed hungry rule. It is a certain parenting style. As a grown up I have certain foods I don\u2019t like (not a lot) and wouldn\u2019t want anyone to force me eating it. So I don\u2019t really think forcing children will get the good results and it is not a lot of fun at the table. But there are so many other options here. Only apologizing to this child is not one of them. That is just weird. OP, you did your best to accomodate this family and the mother was plain rude to you. There were many more options she could have chosen to do. But did this instead. So NTA.

NTA.", "NTA As others have said, your reaction was a bit much and you could\u2019ve handled it better, but I can see how Sandra\u2019s behavior drove you there. You were not wrong - she was and she is going to raise a spoiled, entitled brat if she keeps on behaving like this.", "NTA good lord you weren\u2019t hired as a cook for the evening. Sandra should have asked Charlie to apologize and be patient and wait to eat something else at home. Sounds like Mike is also failing to step up and lay down boundaries with his wife and daughter.", "NTA\n\nIf we're invited to dinner with our kids, I take food they like as backup. They might eat what's on offer (usually more likely while out than at home TBH) or they will have what I have taken, sometimes both depending on how hungry they are! I never expect a host to cater to my kids!", "NTA - Yes, you could have handled it a little more gracefully and throwing them out was a bit harsh. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s ridiculous from Sandra a) to have you apologize and b) to expect you to cater to Charlie\u2019s needs. You clearly served edible food, otherwise the plates would have not been polished.\n\nAlso, if Sandra and Mike already know that Charlie is a picky eater, it\u2019s on them to bring suitable food. Especially if Charlie was \u201cinconsolable\u201d, it was on them to call the evening short. Thank you for the meal and to head out. \n\nAnother option for them would be to stop somewhere on the way home to get Charlie something (though I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a great pedagogical idea)", "I come from a culture where hospitality is very valued, and my goal in your situation would be to make sure nobody leaves hungry haha. Kids can be weird lol, if the kid didn't like what I made I'd immediately offer something else like a piece of bread with butter, or literally anything I had just in the fridge. Nobody would expect you to cook a whole other meal for the kid but just offering something else the kid would want to eat is just normal to me. Your response sounds so extreme to me haha. But I understand we are not all the same. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom was way out of line with wanting you to apologize to her kid lol. And also if she just asked you if you had anything else the kid could eat, that would be ok, but demanding it and complaining that \"this was her night off from cooking\" is crazy to me hahaha, idk what these people have in their heads.\n\nI'd say NTA, the moms reaction sounded absurd. But learn from this and keep in mind that this is how dinners with kids can go, so maybe you'll also want to respond differently next time this happens.", "In this situation, it seems that both parties could have handled things better. While the host did try to accommodate any dietary restrictions beforehand, the child's dislike of the meal is not the host's fault. However, it may have been helpful for the host to have some alternative options available or suggest that the child could eat something else they may have brought with them.\n\nOn the other hand, the guest's request for a second meal and expectation that the host would cater to their child's preferences may have been unreasonable. It also seems that the guest was overly critical and confrontational towards the host, which escalated the situation.\n\nOverall, it's understandable that the host felt frustrated and upset with the guest's behavior, but kicking them out of the house may not have been the most productive solution. It may be worth reaching out to the couple to apologize for the heated exchange and try to find a way to move forward in a more positive manner", "ESH - you because you slammed your plate down and asked them to leave, you should have stayed calm and just said there was nothing else for dessert and then it would have been N-T-A, Sandra was being inappropriate and a rude and unappreciative guest by expecting you to cook something else for Charlie because she didn't like the cake.", "Sandra is a lunatic", "NTA. Nine years old and she\u2019s having tantrums about food?! If the parents are going to bring a kid with that kind of food issues over, the LEAST they could have done is sheepishly tell you ahead of time, \u201cUnfortunately Charlie eats only macaroni and cheese and vanilla cake, would you mind making a box of Annie\u2019s?\u201d Or they could\u2019ve brought food for the kid.

That's the parents responsibility not yours.", "NTA. Absolutely not. This is next level entitlement. The kid is old enough to be told not to have a meltdown over this.

Quite recently I did that and then what was served to me was so good I regretted it!\n\nAlso, you asked if they have any food issues - not liking chocolate is something I would always mention because while chocolate desserts are virtually standard, it's also just as easy to make something non chocolate if you know.", "NTA but maybe you could have offered to make the kid a sandwich, just to keep the peace.", "NTA. If Sandra suspected her child might have trouble eating somewhere, the onus was on her to take the opportunity offered to tell you her kid doesn\u2019t like chocolate, won\u2019t eat certain textures, etc. Hell, at the very LEAST she could have asked you what you planned to make and if she knew her kid wouldn\u2019t eat it, brought something from home!\n\nDemanding you APOLOGIZE then cook her kid a whole new meal because she failed to inform you what her kid would eat is appalling.

She was out of line asking you to apologize and you did it anyway. You suggested them leaving because of obvious reasons and Sandra got rude and snappy. I honestly don't understand why they didn't get up to leave as soon as the daughter started crying. \n\nLook my little brother ate five foods for like fifteen years but there wasn't crying or tantrums.

She ended up almost taking over my kitchen to make 5 different spaghettis. \n\nI couldn't use onions in my sauce... that's fine because a lot of people are picky about onions. One kid got noodles and sauce straight out of the jar. Two kids had frozen meatballs she brought to cook. Only one kid had the actual spaghetti that I made once I was allowed to combine my noodles and the meat sauce I made. It took an hour to make an easy 30 minute meal. \n\nThe next time I just made chicken nuggets and fries. They started complaining that the ketchup was bad.

Or is their child on the spectrum and your friends didn't want to say anything?? 9 is old enough to communicate ..so the crying concerns me.\n\n\nYou had every right to refuse and kick them out. Yelling and slamming dishes was an ahole thing especially in front of a child that was the cause of the upset in the first place.

But I would have communicated that. I don't understand why the mom wasn't more helpful when OP asked about food issues.

Asked her about what I was feeling (symptoms wise) and she immediately stopped eating to get the food away from me. She got me something different. I didn\u2019t even know I was allergic until I opened up to her about what certain foods made me feel. And I didn\u2019t know because the adults around me up until then, sucked!!\n\n\n\nTl;DR food allergy discovered late in life because sucky adults in my life, be careful with that one bite rule, engage your child with what they are feeling about/with food.", "NTA. Wtf is up with the mom expecting an apology when she was the one that said you needn't worry about what you cooked?", "NTA. That child is 9 years old. I would maybe let a toddler act that way. At nine your parents should have taught you that you don\u2019t always get what you want and how to behave as a guest. My daughter would not have acted like that at six years old , let alone 9.

That\u2019s a terrifying sounding adult tantrum you had there too Op. Doing that in front of a child is scary and was uncalled for. \n\nUntil reading that I was 100% in NTA territory. You asked the parents if there was anything to know. You picked out a relatively kid-friendly meal, especially your choice of dessert. \n\nThey were rude. She\u2019s 9, not 2, so shouldn\u2019t have had a toddler tantrum like she did and this is on her parent\u2019s failing to teach her how to regulate her emotions. \n\nThe mom asking you to make a second meal? Absolutely not. If you choose to bring your child over to someone\u2019s house for a meal and you don\u2019t give them ANY heads up on food aversions or discuss the menu in advance\u2026 that\u2019s your fault as the parent. \n\nTips for the future though: if you are inviting a child to your house, tell the parents the official menu and see if their kid eats it. \u201cHey, I\u2019m thinking of chicken parm. Does Charlie eat that or should I keep the chicken separate and plain for her?\u201d could have solved this. Also keeping some sides freely available.  Meals where the ingredients are separate is better when you\u2019re unsure what people eat, as it gives them the opportunity to avoid their dislikes. A dish like chicken Parmesan is everything all together - you can\u2019t easily avoid dislikes with that meal.  \n\nI say this as a picky eater especially with texture - I liked chicken but depending on what was in the sauce I may have also refused to eat the meal, although I would have tried scraping everything off to just eat the chicken. Depending on how safe I felt in the environment I may have viewed doing that as ok, or I may have simply not ate. If there were sides available, even just buns with butter, I would have ate that to fill myself up a little. I\u2019ve had a lot of meals that were basically just bread and butter due to not liking anything else. Unlike Charlie though I was raised to absolutely NOT speak up, and was in fact often the one harassed by someone trying to force me to eat things I didn\u2019t want. I was fine going without but I was NOT going to eat something I hated. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to cater to a fussy child (or fussy adults!), but there are things you can do to make it easier. 1. Communicate the menu in advance. 2. Pick meals where it\u2019s relatively easy to separate at least some components 3. Have simple sides available that can supplement. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you did any of the three, although you did try to pick something kid-friendly. The parents failed to communicate with you, but there\u2019s also a chance that maybe their kid isn\u2019t normally picky and you just happened to pick out a meal that she hates. \n\nThe mom was definitely an asshole trying to get you to make a new meal. That\u2019s inappropriate. But you should NOT have had such a temper tantrum either - slamming plates onto the table to kick someone out?! That\u2019s terrifying.", "NTA, I have a three year old and she would do something like this for sure, which would embarrass me a little since you clearly put time and effort into cooking something great and kid-friendly.

Sitting eating while his child cries and refuses to eat and his partner haranguing the host while he sits silent is not a good look. I\u2019m guessing he was seriously embarrassed by everything. \n\nWas it Mike who told you all food was good or just Sandra? I\u2019m wondering what Mikes version of his daughters eating is.", "Yeah, I think there's something going on on her end.  Maybe because she's older, maybe she's insecure about other friendships he has.... IDK.  But it's not you, from what you've said", "The most bizarre part of this is Mike's reaction, honestly. He left you high and dry while his wife was being condescending and super weird, and to act that way when it's your husband's coworker? It's like she was using her kid to sabotage your friendship or something, which is gross, and didn't seem to surprise Mike whatsoever. I'm honestly baffled.", "Yeah, you were totally NTA here, but the only thing you could have done different is offer to look for something that didn't require much prep, like offer a sandwich or something. Sandra and Charlie behaved very badly. Sandra was especially rude, demanding an apology from you to her, frankly rude and spoiled, child. Mike has been enabling this behavior, which isn't extreme YET, but it's also not good. \n\nI honestly also get a vibe that Sandra might be a bit inappropriately jealous and doesn't want to admit it, but that could be totally in my head. :-) Good luck with this, I hope you are able to keep your friendship intact! And I hope Mike intercedes before his daughter turns into a total entitled spoiled brat...his wife though. Ugh.", "If I were you, I wouldn't text him. They owe you an apology, so they SHOULD reach out to you. Not the contrary.", "I think you handled it just fine. If it were me I would have pointed at the door the moment she insinuated  that you should apologize. That was an incredibly disrespectful thing for her to say to someone who had just put a lot of time and money into preparing a nice dinner for them.\n\nHer behaviour is definitely not reflective of all parents. Most of us typically demonstrate what is and what is not an appropriate response in social situations well before the age of nine. Your friend is going to have a pretty hard time driving this home to her daughter if she herself has not yet been able to grasp this concept herself.", "Honestly the fact that you didn't flip the table over when Ms Entitlement asked if you didn't have something you wanted to say to Charley was very polite of you in my book.", "NTA. 9 yrs. old is a bit old to be crying because \"you don't like chocolate cake.\" Her mother handled it all wrong, IMO.", "Oh I agree completely. Sandra is massively an asshole. I don\u2019t blame Op for kicking them out - but slamming the plates on the table was an aggressive action that I don\u2019t think was appropriate. \n\nWhen Sandra realized her kid was hangry she should have left with the kid - even asking OP if they had any food for Sandra to cook is rude.", "This kid wasn\u2019t dying of hunger. You did nothing wrong. If the kid is this picky (and mom is going to encourage obnoxious behavior), then this poor excuse for a mother should have pa med some crackers in her purse.", "Or at the bare minimum Sandra could have said something when asked ahead of time", "Especially since Sandra told OP nothing about Charlie\u2019s food issues, either before or at dinner. Was OP really expected to make another meal, without knowing if the kid would like that either? Or let Charlie have whatever she wants from OP? Is that their practice at home, to keep offering Charlie food until she takes some? (That at least would explain why Sandra is so desperate to get a night off, but not why she\u2019d expect anyone else to do that for her.)\n\nAppropriate thing for the parents to do would either to ask for something basic and specific that might be on hand (like bread), or leave. It\u2019s not appropriate for parents to make kids force down food, or let them starve, but finding appropriate food for the kid is the parents\u2019 job.", "No kids & I fill mine up if I got lug it around gotta be more than just money \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "That's what I always ask when I take my kids to a friend's and they're serving pasta. \n\n\"Hey can you just leave some pasta without sauce?\"\n\nThe kids are so happy with that.", "I was *such* a picky eater as a child and if I couldn't eat it I was embarrassed and prayed no one would pay attention to it, because I didn't want to be rude. Making a fuss is just bizarre", "I thought the kid was a toddler!\nNine is too old for that but understandable considering the circumstances surrounding grandma being hospitalized.", "I too take it as some sort of power play, or that Charlie might have been upset about something and took it out on the food.", "I will say that as someone who was hugely anxious as a kid, eating at the home of someone I didn't know well did in fact make everything taste bad, even if it was something I usually loved. That part does make sense to me, by weird little kid logic.\n\n\nThat said, I wouldn\u2019t have done this because throwing a tantrum just makes people get mad at you, which was way worse than swallowing every bite with water like a pill so you can't taste it much, or hiding it in a napkin if you can get away with it.", "I both do and don't understand why parents put up with and make so many accommodations to kids who are picky. I don't have any kids myself, but I have two nieces and two nephews that I'm close with.\n\nMy siblings and I all grew up hearing \"you eat what you're given\", I especially remember one time when we had porridge for dinner (a kind I didn't like) and I had to sit at the table for hours even after everyone else had finished. Another time, I said that I hated the food our parents served. My older sister corrected me and said \"No, you don't _like_ the food\". Now as an adult, I will eat just about anything I'm served. There are some things I still don't like but will eat anyway if I'm invited somewhere, like broccoli. I'm not sure if the correct strategy is \"sit at the table until you're finished\", but it definitely taught me a lesson in politeness.\n\nAs an aunt, I try teaching the kids to at least have a taste. Sometimes kids say they hate something just by looking at it, and they might be surprised (like when my niece discovered that she actually loves brussel sprouts). It breaks my heart when they get upset because they don't like the food, but it would take much for me to cook them something else. Especially at age 9. Of course I don't want them to go hungry, but food is still food and they shouldn't act like the kid in the post.\n\nI get that it's difficult to deal with a picky kid, and maybe they'll turn out to be not-picky-adults, but where do you draw the line for a childs behaviour?", "I think it's hard to judge the kid, she didn't behave perfectly but she didn't try to say the food was terrible or tantrum either.\n\nEither the parents knew she was a picky eater and didn't tell OP **and** didn't bring food for her or she's maybe had a more limited diet and no one knew she was picky.  My family ate literally about 6 cooked meals with minimal variation and unfamiliar situation with unfamiliar food and hungry is a bad combination.\n\nThe mother's reaction was mildly insane though and the father's non-reaction was weird.", "The not giving the cake to go is the most important part. Haha!", "Nah, I'm all for letting Mike eat the rest of his cake.", "I cloudn't believe that bit. \"have the night off\", they are meant to be friends not caterers", "Or: \u201cIf you can\u2018t teach your child to behave, then you deserve all the extra work.\u201d", "I had a cousin end up with 4 copies of the same CD. Apparently when anyone asked what he wanted for his bday that's the only thing he told them.", "\"I'm sorry your mom didn't raise you properly.\"", "This was my first thought too. Unfortunately due to environmental factors girls are starting to go through puberty at earlier ages so even though 9 might seem too young, it's really not. I remember having a similar meltdown when I was around 11 and *knowing* I was being irrational and just not being able to get a handle on my behavior for some reason I couldn't explain. I got my first period a day or two later. Could be that the kid and mom are just overwhelmed by that happening.", "Is your kid childhood me? I have a birthday right before a major holiday (plus I share it with a cousin) and I didn't really like cake. The extended family always wanted to combine our b-days with the holiday. There were years where we had a chocolate cake with coconut (I hated coconut). They'd put a numbered candle in the cake for my cousin, sing happy b-day and then repeat the process for me. I loved pie though; my mom always made me a birthday pie for us at home.\n\nEdited to add: I also think you've got a good point about the hormones. I was much more hormonal when I was 9-10 than as a teen. I don't even think the issue is Charlie's behavior as much as the mom's reaction.", "Good parenting \ud83d\udc4d", "I hated ice cream.

The one and only food she will always eat 100% of the time is peanut butter and apple jelly sandwiches. The problem is, I don't get an alert when her dietary preferences change and I'm feeding 5 other people too so there's no way to know if she'll eat the food I prepare even if it's something she devoured 2 days ago.

I have reusable squeeze pouches that I use for peanut butter and jelly and a bread box on the lowest shelf in the kitchen and I keep the cheese and yogurt cups in the crisper drawer of the fridge at all times so if one of my kids won't (or can't) eat what I made for dinner, they're free to grab or prepare their own \"meal B\" themselves. The only rules I have for dessert are that they have to at least *try* any new foods and they have to eat *something* for dinner if they want dessert or an after dinner snack.

I don't believe in 'kids should eat whatever they're given and clean their plates, back in my day we ate dirt and were happy to have it', some kids have sensory issues that make it genuinely tortuous to eat certain foods (and this can apply whether they have a diagnosis of autism or not), and in any case, they should have the choice to not eat it if they want, even if the alternative is going hungry for that one meal. It won't kill them. Though really in this case the parents who knew their kid is very picky should've told you the things she does like in advance or brought sandwiches from home.\n\nBUT.... that's not on the person who made the food at all. You went out of your way to think of and prepare a meal you (very reasonably) thought would appeal to them. (Hell, what kid doesn't like chocolate cake???) It's neither the kids' nor your fault that you happened to be wrong, so there's absolutely nothing you should apologise for. If anything, the kid's parents should make her apologise to you, not as a big deal, but simply because it's polite to do so when someone cooks you a meal and you don't eat it, even if it's for a very good reason.", "NTA\n\n\nIf I was you, OP, I would demand an apology from both Charlie and her mom for ruining dinner. Charlie needs to be taught that acting like a brat at a dinner that is being hosted by someone else, who clearly went to alot of effort to make things that Charlie would find appealing,  is not acceptable behavior. \nI would have been disciplined if I acted like this as a child. I am sorry the girls grandma is not well, but that does not excuse bad behavior.", "NTA. They could get the kid something on the way home.

It's baffling to me that a nine year old would still be catered to with 'children friendly' food. Like... When I was 9, if I didn't have allergies for the particular food (anything except honey), I would get served that. If I'm hungry- I can eat, if I'm not, I can decline, but when I got hungry I would have gotten served the 'adult' food again.", "i mean, you could've asked Charlie if she'd like a sandwich or something easy and quick to make. and i can see why she'd be upset if her grandma had gone to the hospital that day. but Sandra is a grown woman and regardless of how upset she was, she should've handled it like an adult and asked if you could make Charlie a sandwich or whatever.

He's almost 9 and he still won't eat anything but nuggets, pizza, or waffles.\n\nI've cooked for the whole family almost every holiday since my SO and I started dating. (His mother went into long term care that year and nobody else could cook so I took over for her) I do try to make things that everyone will enjoy, and there's usually an assortment of sides to pick from. But I have never, ever, made separate meals for the picky kid. If he's going to be picky, they can either bring something for him, or he gets what's being served. Usually he'll pick at the dinner rolls and a side dish. \n\nBut I'm definitely not going to enable the kid to be in the habit of expecting to get special treatment for being a picky eater. At least not at my house. If his parents want to enable that, fine. But not when I'm cooking for everyone. \n\nI don't know how people have become entitled to the point of expecting a dinner host to accommodate for everyone's kids' picky eating habits. It's not the same as having an allergy, and it's honestly super rude to expect someone to make extra food after already cooking for everyone.", "NTA. Your friend should have been honest as to what was going on. Worse, the fact she wanted you to apologize to her child because she was upset over something totally unrelated to the meal is absurd. I do not understand how the mother thought it was appropriate to expect you to cook another meal when you already cleared the dinner plans with her. You did right in the situation, and I agree with you that I wouldn't invite them over for dinner or any meal again.", "NTA. And the edit is ridiculous. I'm sorry her mom was I. The hospital but she's old enough to make excuses.\n\nYou were right and Sandra should ge speaking to you and apologizing .", "Even with the update NTA. a hard time doesn\u2019t excuse treating your friends like your kids personal food slaves.", "NAH from seeing the update. You did your best and Sandra and Charlie were obviously having a terrible day. I don't understand why Sandra refused to give you context about why she and Charlie were so out of sorts, however. Also asking you to apologise for making something the child doesn't like was odd. I definitely would give them the benefit of the doubt for the circumstances of the day, but definitely don't cook for them again, unless it's a joint thing where you all cook together.", "NTA. \n\nThe greater context here was helpful. If I could wager a guess, I'd say that Charlie really isn't a very picky eater most of the time, but had BIG feelings about Grandma being in the hospital and decided to pick something to control. Sandra was likely expecting some sort of special treatment due to her family circumstances, but at the same time she was withholding the information that likely would've allowed you to be more gracious and understanding towards her. \n\nSide note: I personally *HATE* it when people do this. They expect you to read their minds and just bend over backwards to accommodate, while at the same time not giving out their \"personal\" information because it's private and sensitive. Like, choose a side!! Withholding information and then expecting you to just ASSUME that they're \"going through a rough time\" instead of just being entitled jerks is just,...mind-boggling to me. So, you'd rather people think you're a narcissistic a$$ instead of sharing that you're just going through something right now?? Really?!", "Da fu<k??? You really apologized to a spoiled brat? Sandra should have made her kid apologize to you! And asking you to make something else to eat?

Imagine being 9, you JUST saw your grandmother in the hospital and now you're being whisked to some stranger's house for a dinner party you probably didn't wanna go to in the first place with no one else your age there to hear boring grown up talk, and you've probably been instructed to not bring up Grandma and you can't understand why and it makes you even more scared that somethings wrong with her. Now you're there and maybe you get a plate full of food you've never seen before, maybe it's food you know you don't like, maybe it's food you DO like but you're just not hungry because it's been a hard day! And your parents and this stranger are just talking and talking like nothing bad even happened today and your brain just cannot wrap itself around that fact. And then it's dessert and it's cake so you try to make yourself like it because you do like cake even if you don't like the flavor and cake makes you happy but it doesn't even help and you just can't take it anymore and you're so scared about grandma and what is even going on! And you just start crying. And you know you can't talk about grandma and even at 9 you know crying over food is rude so you say you don't like chocolate because you don't wanna offend this stranger. And then your mom gets mad which is even more scary and the stranger and your mom start fighting and your dad is just ignoring it all and then you get kicked out! and in your mind that's YOUR fault! you just ruined your parent's and this stranger's night!\nAND THEN (and thank GOD charlie doesn't know about all this) people on reddit call you a demon and much MUCH worse because you didn't behave 100% appropriately on what was maybe just the hardest damn day you've ever had in your 9 short years so far on this planet. \nI want some info, though.

They needed to get some calories into her.  So, it isn\u2019t any sort of indulgence to make her chocolate milk, cocoa, or a smoothie or something, to get her something that she could swallow.   With a kid who normally eats fine, when they don\u2019t eat because something is wrong, you need to figure out what is wrong and take care of them.  She wasn\u2019t acting up.

Or hey we're struggling today cuz so and so went into the hospital we appreciate the meal as we don't have the time to make one. Like wtf. You handled the situation as best you could given the info you had at the time. Obviously a 9 year old is going to be scared and upset from a hospital visit and can't process emotions well.

If they were struggling so much - per your second edit - why not just rearrange to another night? I'm not convinced that's a good enough explanation. The bit where Sandra insisted you *apologise* for doing nothing wrong was too fucked up.", "You obviously not the AH. But Man Sandra is a total AH. Doesn't even matter her mom is in the hospital what she demanded at someone else's house was unreasonable. Sure kids usually has a hard time expressing themselves but her as a mom has no right to demand someone to cook a special meal for her child just because her kids isn't eating. Also her demanding you to apologize to her child over not liking your food is also insane.

They should have rung and canceled on the day or been upfront about having had a stress filled, emotional day.  It would have sucked but you would have been aware of what was going.

If Sandra wants something else for her child, she should suggest it and it should be something very quick and easy to prepare.\n\nI saw the edit - if you are troubled by something, and you don't want others to know, then you need to be stoic.

He said he would have said something about it, but Sandra had asked him not to mention it then so she could focus on dinner, which is totally fair. Charlie isn't normally a picky eater or spoiled or autistic or anything, she was just upset about grandma. Why she latched onto saying she didn't like chocolate is really anyone's guess. Sandra's mom is doing better now and while the family didn't behave at their best, I've got no hard feelings about dinner any more.

Some people don't like certain foods and will never like them.

Is it alright if we call it a night early?\" and then go home where everyone could feel their feelings without making everything weird.

There were times when he'd reheat the same food until I ate it. There were times when I was grounded for not eating.  He went to extremes over the stupid fish. I'm very much an adult now, but the very sight or smell of fish still makes me ill. Attempting to actually eat it causes me to vomit. \n\nMy mother, on the other hand, would cook something else for the picky eaters. This only made them more picky and wasn't good, either. \n\nI make them try everything once. If they don't like it, they don't have to eat it.
