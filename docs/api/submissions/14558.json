Very similar. Worst mistake ever. My view of my family member is now ruined, and I want nothing to do with their partner (meaning the family member likely won't be coming around much, either).

Don't let her move back in, these 2 sorry excuses for adults don't even take care of themselves, they sure aren't ready to support a child.  And she is rude and demanding to you in your own home.  Never mind who she thought the owner was, it was your home and she was rude.  Tell your brother she can't move back.  Period.  Don't give a reason.

I\u2019m not from the US, so have no clue on the ins and outs of that type of thing.

Get a lawyer, because you need to do everything by the book when you evict their entitled asses.", "You are never the AH when you tell the truth and accidentally out someone\u2019s lie.

She needed to be put in her place. Was she planning on even giving you money for your half of the house if she thought you both owned it? I bet not.", "NTA, you need to kick him out.  In a roundabout way he is staking claim to what is yours.  She is at her mother's, so she is being taken care of.  He has lived there for some time so you may need to go through the legal process of kicking him out.  He needs to grow up as he will soon be a father and you need to stop enabling him.", "NTA! You need to distance yourself from these freeloaders. They could even be dangerous. You\u2019ve heard of Cain and Abel, right?\n\nShe is counting her chickens before they have hatched. Scary.", "NTA and you\u2019d be wise to never allow her to move back in. She can live with her mom and the baby until your brother can adult and afford his own place.

What I would give to have seen her face.", "I am cracking up at how her face must have looked when you told her the truth LOL! NTA. She now has all the space she needs at her mother\u2019s.
