That's pretty hard given she is carrying your niece/nephew, but she may have married him considering the house was going to be theirs.\n\nAdditionally they had no issue kicking you from your home?

People don\u2019t just decide things are theirs and cya.. also even if your brother was part owner it would be the same situation.. they\u2019d have to buy you out of your half and that\u2019s if you even wanted to leave.

It's your house and your brother doesn't own any part of it, so you were right to tell his wife that she couldn't demand that you move out.
