We saw it as a mutually beneficial thing to adopt her, she could give us extra help with housework while we offer her a stable home. I have always supported her and encouraged her to have a good education and do well in school like my sons so that when she becomes an adult she can have a good life.\n\nHowever she would never be equivalent to my own child but I still help where I can. My distant relatives do not see her the same as she is from a different caste. She is still however a nice and pretty and smart girl. I still do a lot for her, she has her room, laptop, new books and everything. The only thing she does not have which in India is typical for daughters is lots of jewellery and gold (which my sons do not have much of either).\n\nWhen we were discussing universities for my younger son, she seemed to have assumed we would send her abroad as well and had looked up some universities. I explained to her there are good ones in India she can go to, close to our home and that it would be expensive to send her abroad after paying for my sons. She did not argue or anything but ever since we had this talk she is acting cold and distant and replying with the bare minimum. I think she knows our finances are quite good and thinks she should go as well and now I am having second thoughts as is my wife. She is a really nice girl and we love her a lot but it is a lot of money and I feel like it might be unfair and affect the inheritance of my sons eventually.\n\nEDIT: I mentioned caste because my distant relatives do not see her as my daughter or accept her and dislike my family for adopting her. I do not believe in that and technically our own caste is not something considered that special in India. We have a maid so she does more chores than my sons but it is not like she is the servant or something.

WTF is wrong with you? You don't adopt a child to have do chores, you adopt them because you want a child and love them. So yes, pull your awful head out of your butt and send your daughter abroad to study so she has the same advantages as your \"real\" children. Just the fact that you don't refer to her as your real child makes me so angry on her behalf. You adopted her so it's your responsibility to treat her 100% the same as your sons. She also deserves the same amount of inheritance btw so don't be a dick about that too.", "YTA She's from a different caste but she's ok because she's pretty?

As equals in every way. They are not regarded as cheap maids.", "YTA\n\nYou wrote all this BS and you are still wondering?", "YTA\n\nPrepare to be eviscerated in the comments. I understand there are some cultural differences which many people won\u2019t appreciate (or support), but you will get a strong reaction due to \n\nA) adopting a girl for housework, as if an adopted daughter (or son!) owes you labor when, as an adoptive parent, it is your responsibility to provide care and sustenance - kids shouldn\u2019t be house help, girls particularly shouldn\u2019t be singled out for house help, adopted kids shouldn\u2019t have to work where biological kids don\u2019t, etc. You seem to be giving her a material existence she wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise but most people here will come at you for these reasons. \n\nB) continuing to make a distinction between adopted and biological kids; in many cultures it\u2019s seen as quite wrong to favor some children over others. Biological over adopted, sons over daughters, one caste over another. \n\nC) possibly making a distinction also because of gender.

Your boys, your beloved flesh and blood, see her as their own. That\u2019s their sister, they even got excited thinking she will have the same education you plan to give your youngest son. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m guessing marriage is out of the question for her cause you won\u2019t pay her dowry and she\u2019s a lower caste, hence, she will be your maid forever. \n\nI wonder if those boys are aware of the plans you had and have for their sister. She deserves better. They all do. Poor kids.", "You are disgusting. How dare you. This post is absolutely ridiculous. Poor child. She deserves so much better. I hope she grows to be a wonderful, brilliant woman, inspite of you. YTA to another level.", "YTA. You should not have adopted her with such an attitude towards her. If you originally planned that she would only do housework. This is selfish.", "YTA. I get it's culture and all that but since you're of a class that is able to send kids abroad there is nothing stopping her from knowing how the rest of the world works. She knows girls and other \"castes\" in other countries have the same opportunities as boys as long as someone is there to support them in the same way (and I know enough South Asians to know there are families giving girls the same chances). So you can stick to a backwards idea and have her resent you and not support you once she is able to support herself or you give her an opportunity to become someone that can better more than just herself.", "INFO: Does adoption in India work differently than in the West? For instance, in Western society, an adopted child is 100% your child, and they are generally treated the same as a biological child. Based on what you wrote, it appears that in Indian culture, this isn't the same, and an \"adopted\" child is more like a foster child or some sort of conditional relationship rather than the relationship between an actual parent and child. But based on the Western understanding of adoption, this would be considered a very AH move. \n\nCan any other Indians weigh in on whether there is a cultural difference between adoption in the India vs the West?", "INFO: Legally speaking, what are your responsibilities towards her. When you adopt a child in India, is that child legally your responsibility or are their tiers?", "Holy shit YTA. \n\nIt is beyond disgusting you adopted this girl with the intention of her being your maid. How dare you do that to her. She is a human too, not your slave.", "YTA", "YTA There\u2019s a major cultural difference that is going to make it hard for some redditors to understand why you think this behavior is ok. It\u2019s not ok, but I at least understand why you think it is ok because I\u2019m the daughter of Indian immigrants. While my parents would never adopt a child and treat them as less, I\u2019ve seen others who did (unofficially, there\u2019s not a lot of people I\u2019ve known who\u2019d actually adopt any child that wasn\u2019t their niece or nephew). The idea isn\u2019t that they are your full child. It\u2019s more that the alternatives are so bad that you taking them into the household even as a ward with some obligations to you is far, far better.  You may have saved her from being sold into a marriage with a drunk or left on the streets or abused by family who resented being responsible for an orphan or any number of fates that are far worse than only being kind of a daughter. \n\nBut what you are doing isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s a moral failing in our culture that we don\u2019t promote full adoption of children into the family. It is a moral failing that we haven\u2019t stamped out caste discrimination. It is a moral failing that we treat women as less than men.  Be better than that. Let her study abroad. Tell her it was a mistake to say no and that you weren\u2019t thinking straight. You wanted to do a good deed, so do one and model better behavior for others. Most people don\u2019t do it because they don\u2019t want to be out of the ordinary, they don\u2019t want to stand out or they think they can get away with doing less because no one will call them out. Do better than them.", "YTA-You aren\u2019t treating her like your child. You are treating her like she\u2019s your servant or your pet.

Any expense you undertake for them takes away from her.\n\nEither she\u2019s a daughter of your house or she isn\u2019t.", "You said yourself that it would impact the \"inheritance of my sons\"...it's quite clear who is and isn't getting inheritance. If she was getting inheritance, maybe it's better to offer her it now so that she can go to the school she chooses?", "Let me guess, you mentioned she helps with the housework so probably takes the load off your wife. Your real worry is if she goes, becomes more open minded etc she won\u2019t come back and help and let you arrange a marriage?", "I can imagine, as you yourself are making a distinction between your adopted daughter and your sons. While explaining to me why you think you're not TA based on the distinction that she's adopted, you're trying to sell me on the idea that what you're doing for her is already a lot... _considering she is a girl_.\n\nI'm going to repeat, this girl has access to the Internet. She'll be reading everywhere about adopted kids who have the same love from their parents as their non-adopted siblings, and girls being treated the same as boys.\n\nIf you want to know why she's suddenly cooled off towards you, I'd look in that direction.\n\nIt's hard to be grateful to someone when the rest of the world tells you they're being sexist.", "I\u2019m not surprised. Who will want to return to this", "Jewelry is often passed down within families, this could be another indicator that she\u2019s not being treated as a \u201creal\u201d daughter. Also, if she has no good jewelry to wear it might make her appear lower in status and emphasize her birth family\u2019s low caste.", "Didn\u2019t realise it till you pointed it out, but families taking in kids like this is a common story, their education and general expenses are taken care of but not like the actual children and it seems like OP has done more than most would\u2019ve since higher education is also being paid for", "See my other comments, I just explained it to someone else.", "I have so far not given her (I have given a little not lots), but these days inheritance is equal for daughters so she will get that. \n\nMy sons have not gotten gold either.", "She\u2019d probably choose to go overseas for education as opposed to stay as a servant.", "Slavery is still accepted and legal in India; about 8 million people or, roughly, 20% of the world's enslaved are in India. OP went against his family and caste system to bring this young woman into his home *possibly for ulterior gain, but it's not too late to send her abroad* . It SOUNDS LIKE he's having second thoughts about something he's been told and believed all of his life, and he realizes he can change his adoptee's life. Kudos to him, I imagine many, in his position, wouldn't even wonder if they were wrong. \n\nNTA if you realize you are wrong and give her a chance in another country so she can have a life!", "It's also not 'maybe' unfair. It's straight up cruel.", "I really hope for the girls sake, she goes abroad and then stays forever.", "True , by far he only took her in as a maid or a girl to take care of household chores but him to proceed into providing her education with several other privileges sounds intriguing but it only led her into believing that she was more than just a girl who wasn't as close as she thought she was , which is cold from op .", "saw your comments. still has nothing to do with our culture. i", "So when you\u2019re depriving her of something that most biological daughters get (jewelry), you want to claim it\u2019s because you\u2019re treating your sons and daughter equally.\n\nBut when you\u2019re denying her something that her brothers have received (attending school abroad), it\u2019s because most biological daughters don\u2019t travel abroad to study. \n\nWhich is it?", "You said it\u2019s normal to not give sons a lot of gold so I\u2019m not sure why you think that\u2019s a point in your favor. \n\nYou adopted a girl to do housework. You admit you value your sons more. You admit that you think sending her away for school will hurt your sons\u2019 inheritance (but don\u2019t care that sending your sons away for school is hurting hers). You don\u2019t care about her life; a foreign education would benefit her life more and you deny it because it might one day result in less money for your precious boys. \n\nYou can try to convince yourself as much as you like that you aren\u2019t in the wrong here but your actions scream otherwise.", "So it *never* benefitted daughters? They got jewellery but the men got the inheritence... that's not favouring daughters.", "You know that collecting a girl's wedding set starts from birth, and you know that sons don't usually get wedding sets. Don't downplay this.", "So dons usually get given gold as children? Or is that a daughter thing culturally?", "Definitely. I can\u2019t help but wonder if OP doesn\u2019t want her to have the opportunity to go abroad simply because if she did so they\u2019d have to hire more \u201chelp.\u201d", "While that\u2019s true it\u2019s pretty common and pretending otherwise isn\u2019t going to help anyone, Indian culture has the concept of \u201cotherness\u201d deeply ingrained and it\u2019s just the degree that varies with people outside family such as community, region, religion etc.", "In other cultures this concept is very rare as orphaned kids from families without means are tossed into the \u201csystem\u201d. In India they\u2019re left to fend for themselves.", "Idk about most but a lot of daughters do study abroad. My wife did as well as my nieces (who now live abroad)\n\nI am not denying that, we definitely treated our daughter as almost equal and not equal and maybe that is wrong so we are reconsidering.\n\nAfter we adopted her we really liked her and she is really smart and sweet so, so far except for jewellery she has had the same life a biological daughter would and since we have a maid she does not do most of the chores just more than our sons.", "Isn't it sorta with most people outside India as well ? Even if not visibly , it's still subconsciously ingrained in them how much of a stranger the adoptive kid is to them ? Which is sad , as the adoptive child most of times realise their limit of relationship and love received from a guardian or parent ( not blaming all the adoptive parents tho , there are some great adoptive parents too)", "once again, nothing in indian culture points to being shitty adoptive parents. what you're talking about is completely irrelevant \n\nthe process after adoption is essentially the same as the west, you treat your adoptive child as you would your biological child", "It is wrong, yes.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how can claim she is treated *almost* equally when your entire post is about how she isn\u2019t treated equally at all.\n\nI sincerely hope that you and your wife see the error of your ways.", "It is wrong and your reasoning is terrible", "What a profoundly awful reply. You're horrible parents.", "> as almost equal\n\nYTA. You should not be in charge of children.", "Well shit, thank god you *liked* her /s", "That's so unlucky, if she wasn't always so likeable and well behaved, you could just claim that you treat her worse as a punishment.", "as an indian daughter, if my family made me do more chores than my male relatives i would throw a fit.\n\njust bc its normal in our culture, doesn't mean its not sexist. its a practice rooted in misogny", "Another sign of sexism and favouritism is that she does more chores than your sons. Why?", "You know your entire post shows us that she wasn't treated equally, right? Even your motivation in adopting her wasn't loving.", "Does it look like it was a traditional adoption? There\u2019s a big difference between adoption and taking someone in, from OPs own comments it reads as if they took the girl in and then grew warmer feelings", "I guess some (children) are more equal than others /s"]}
