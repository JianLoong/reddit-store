We saw it as a mutually beneficial thing to adopt her, she could give us extra help with housework while we offer her a stable home. I have always supported her and encouraged her to have a good education and do well in school like my sons so that when she becomes an adult she can have a good life.\n\nHowever she would never be equivalent to my own child but I still help where I can. My distant relatives do not see her the same as she is from a different caste. She is still however a nice and pretty and smart girl. I still do a lot for her, she has her room, laptop, new books and everything. The only thing she does not have which in India is typical for daughters is lots of jewellery and gold (which my sons do not have much of either).\n\nWhen we were discussing universities for my younger son, she seemed to have assumed we would send her abroad as well and had looked up some universities. I explained to her there are good ones in India she can go to, close to our home and that it would be expensive to send her abroad after paying for my sons. She did not argue or anything but ever since we had this talk she is acting cold and distant and replying with the bare minimum. I think she knows our finances are quite good and thinks she should go as well and now I am having second thoughts as is my wife. She is a really nice girl and we love her a lot but it is a lot of money and I feel like it might be unfair and affect the inheritance of my sons eventually.\n\nEDIT: I mentioned caste because my distant relatives do not see her as my daughter or accept her and dislike my family for adopting her. I do not believe in that and technically our own caste is not something considered that special in India. We have a maid so she does more chores than my sons but it is not like she is the servant or something.

I understand there are some cultural differences which many people won\u2019t appreciate (or support), but you will get a strong reaction due to \n\nA) adopting a girl for housework, as if an adopted daughter (or son!) owes you labor when, as an adoptive parent, it is your responsibility to provide care and sustenance - kids shouldn\u2019t be house help, girls particularly shouldn\u2019t be singled out for house help, adopted kids shouldn\u2019t have to work where biological kids don\u2019t, etc. You seem to be giving her a material existence she wouldn\u2019t have had otherwise but most people here will come at you for these reasons. \n\nB) continuing to make a distinction between adopted and biological kids; in many cultures it\u2019s seen as quite wrong to favor some children over others.

She knows girls and other \"castes\" in other countries have the same opportunities as boys as long as someone is there to support them in the same way (and I know enough South Asians to know there are families giving girls the same chances). So you can stick to a backwards idea and have her resent you and not support you once she is able to support herself or you give her an opportunity to become someone that can better more than just herself.", "INFO: Does adoption in India work differently than in the West? For instance, in Western society, an adopted child is 100% your child, and they are generally treated the same as a biological child. Based on what you wrote, it appears that in Indian culture, this isn't the same, and an \"adopted\" child is more like a foster child or some sort of conditional relationship rather than the relationship between an actual parent and child. But based on the Western understanding of adoption, this would be considered a very AH move. \n\nCan any other Indians weigh in on whether there is a cultural difference between adoption in the India vs the West?", "INFO: Legally speaking, what are your responsibilities towards her. When you adopt a child in India, is that child legally your responsibility or are their tiers?", "Holy shit YTA. \n\nIt is beyond disgusting you adopted this girl with the intention of her being your maid. How dare you do that to her. She is a human too, not your slave.", "YTA", "YTA There\u2019s a major cultural difference that is going to make it hard for some redditors to understand why you think this behavior is ok. It\u2019s not ok, but I at least understand why you think it is ok because I\u2019m the daughter of Indian immigrants. While my parents would never adopt a child and treat them as less, I\u2019ve seen others who did (unofficially, there\u2019s not a lot of people I\u2019ve known who\u2019d actually adopt any child that wasn\u2019t their niece or nephew). The idea isn\u2019t that they are your full child. It\u2019s more that the alternatives are so bad that you taking them into the household even as a ward with some obligations to you is far, far better.  You may have saved her from being sold into a marriage with a drunk or left on the streets or abused by family who resented being responsible for an orphan or any number of fates that are far worse than only being kind of a daughter. \n\nBut what you are doing isn\u2019t right. It\u2019s a moral failing in our culture that we don\u2019t promote full adoption of children into the family. It is a moral failing that we haven\u2019t stamped out caste discrimination. It is a moral failing that we treat women as less than men.  Be better than that. Let her study abroad. Tell her it was a mistake to say no and that you weren\u2019t thinking straight. You wanted to do a good deed, so do one and model better behavior for others. Most people don\u2019t do it because they don\u2019t want to be out of the ordinary, they don\u2019t want to stand out or they think they can get away with doing less because no one will call them out.

YTA", "YTA your whole relationship with your daughter sounds so transactional like she's still a charity case. You clearly don't consider her equal to your sons and you flat out say you never will. Then why adopt her in the first place? You could have just set up a donation to support her or hired her as live-in help. Instead you've dangled this idea of a supportive family in front of her and then set her up to get hurt every time she's reminded she will never truly be a daughter to you.   \n\n>I explained to her there are good ones in India she can go to, close to our home and that it would be expensive to send her abroad after paying for my sons.

And when you say \"there are good ones in India she can go to\" you mean good enough for her. She knows there's nothing she can say to that - despite what she's overcome and what she's achieved, she can't expect equal opportunity anywhere. Granted it's already hard to expect that in India as a girl/adopted child from her background, but her parents just joined that bandwagon as well.
