I have also been best friends with my friend let's call her Mimi (23f) since we were 13, we have a lot history and are very good friends. Now back when the tickets for Taylor originally dropped we did not get a verified fan code so we weren't able to access the website to purchase tickets. However Mimi did receive one and she spent the entire day of the drop trying to get tickets for all of us but was unfortunately unable to do so. We were all upset but understood how difficult it was and how hard she tried. We had given up on getting tickets untill about last week where i happen to get insanely lucky on a resale website and was able to snag 2 tickets. I decided to take my partner because I wanted to share this occasion with his especially since we'd have to be traveling to a different state. When I posted on social media about the tickets and how excited i was my friend messaged me upset calling me an asshole for not taking her. She says that she had been trying super hard to get tickets because it would be her first concert and she's literally the biggest fan i know. She callede an asshole saying that i should be taking her instead because my boyfriend isn't really a fan which is partially true he's really only listened to her since her newest album dropped because of me. She is saying that I'm essentially picking him over her friendship because i knew how important this was to her. She is now not speaking to me because she thinks it's unfair and she feels like im choosing him over her. However i just feel like this is an experience I'd prefer to have with my partner than with my friend. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Editing to include the fact that Mimi was not just trying to buy tickets for herself and I there was 5 people in the group. There is group of 3 of us that have been friends since middle school. My partner and 1 other friend that we met in college who were close with make up the 5. She was the only one trying to get tickets on ticketmaster because she was the only one who got a fan code but it would have been whoever got a code that would have been securing the tickets not specifically her. As someone stated in a comment no matter what happened 3 people would have been left out. Also another clarification for those who haven't been involved in the Taylor swift resale situation. When you're buying resale (i worded it wrong originally it wasn't a website it was a group) you don't get to pick how many tickets you're purchasing. Someone will just say hey I'm selling x amount of tickets to this place on this date and you buy them if you can. Honestly like i said we'd all kind of given up hope we'd get tickets because of how difficult it was so when I saw the two i didn't think twice about purchasing them just because it wasn't 5. Chances of finding 5 together this close to the concert is practically impossible. I do see and understand i probably should have told our friends privately i was just way too excited and didn't think about it. Also my boyfriend is a fan! I wouldn't be dragging him there. He would definitely enjoy himself. He just hasn't really listened to her but when her newest album came out I introduced him to more of her music and we listen to her all he time he just happens to be a newer fan.", "created_utc": 1682063348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tub34/aita_for_taking_my_bf_to_the_taylor_swift_concert/", "score": 2787, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's unfortunate that you couldn't  get more, but I'm certain that if you could have procured your friend a ticket, you would have. That doesn't make you an AH.

He\u2019s not even a fan.", "YTA Taylor would be ashamed of you", "Honestly, I was going to ask for more details, but I think regardless of the answers to my question that you're NTA. You got the tickets, your friend group wanted to go but you want to go with your BF and you decided to go with him. That doesn't make you an asshole, it makes you a lucky someone that managed to get ahold of 2 tickets instead of 5. Your friend is upset and disappointed, which is understandable, but hopefully this doesn't break your friendship\n\nI have two reasons for this judgement:\n\n1. The argument that Mimi deserves to get the ticket because she was going to get everyone tickets isn't a good argument at all because boils down to \"*Mimi deserves the ticket because she was the one that got the code.\".* It completely ignores the fact that 'being willing to get everyone tickets' is true of yourself, your boyfriend and the other two friends involved in the plans to try and get these tickets. All of you were trying to get the code and all of you were willing to try and secure tickets for everyone else if you did get the code. Just to show how ridiculous that argument is, let me present the following scenario: Mimi and your boyfriend both got a verified fan code, but your boyfriend could only secure 2 tickets with that fan code. If we follow the argument that is being used for why Mimi deserves one of the tickets that you bought, then in this scenario it means that your boyfriend would be expected to give Mimi one of the 2 tickets he got. What happens to the other? There are several options\n   1. He goes to the concert with Mimi. He bought the ticket so he absolutely does deserve to go, but I think everyone here would agree that it's kind of weird to go to a concert that your Bf/GF wants to go to not with them, but with their best friend.\n   2. He gives you the ticket so that you can go with Mimi. It'd be nice for you and Mimi, but disappointing for him since he's the one that bought both tickets and he doesn't even get to go enjoy the concert.\n   3. He gives one of the other two friends the ticket. How is he going to choose? What would be fair, do they just draw straws and whoever gets the longest straw gets the ticket? Cool, Mimi and that friend get to go to the concert....that he paid for. Are they going to pay him back? Would you have been disappointed that your boyfriend didn't give you one of the two tickets since he gave them both away?\n   4. Since Mimi was the only other person to get the verified code, maybe she and your boyfriend are really the only people that get to choose which of you 5 get to go. So if he's not going to go, and he can't choose whether to give you the other ticket or to give it to one of the other two friends, maybe he just gives them both to Mimi and she gets to choose who gets to accompany her to the concert....that your boyfriend paid for.\n   5. Since he can only get 2 tickets and Mimi isn't able to get any for anyone else, he foregoes getting the tickets and no one goes to the concert.\n2. Being a fan of something for less time than someone else doesn't make them any less of a fan nor does it mean they're \"not a true fan\". They're just a **new** fan, and being a new fan or \"less\" of a fan doesn't mean they are any less deserving of a ticket than a massive long-time fan. If your boyfriend wants to go - genuinely wants to go and not \"wants to go because it makes you happy\" - if he would enjoy going, then he deserves to go just as much as Mimi does. And the people saying that he's \"not a real fan\" just because he's new to her music? You're the same as the dipshits that accuse women in game or comic stores of being \"fake fans\" if they don't know the answers to every question they get asked about the game or comic they're trying to buy.\n\nI think what you are an AH for, though, is for letting her find out over social media that you got two tickets and were going with your boyfriend. She probably would've still been upset (and it's fine for her to be upset and disappointed, just like it's fine for you to choose to go with your BF instead of her), but at least she would have found out directly from you rather than getting the whiplash of seeing it on social media.\n\nEdit: Here's another scenario to show how ridiculous the argument's being used to say Mimi deserves the ticket over OP's BF is: What if OP could only get 1 ticket? Obviously only one person could go, and OP managing to be the one to get the ticket doesn't change, but neither does the arguments for why Mimi should get a ticket. Mimi is the biggest fan of the group and was the one to wait in the virtual line to try and get the 5 tickets (even if she would've been reimbursed by the other members), so does that mean that OP is obligated to give up the one and only ticket he got to Mimi?", "NTA fully going against the grain on this one.\n\nMimi tried to get tickets for all 3 of you but had no luck.\n\nYou got lucky and managed to get 2 tickets.\n\nIt's entirely up to you who you take then. Yes Mimi will miss out and that's a shame but that is all. \n\nYour partner may become your husband in the future and no matter what anyone else says, your partner should always take priority over friends because they are the one you will build a life and future with. Love for a partner is different than that of a friend so ofcourse you will choose them first.", "I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be impressed if mimi got you a ticket and decided to give it to someone else.\n\nI\u2019d be surprised if your friendship hadn\u2019t been ruined over this choice.\n\nYTA.", "YTA lol he\u2019s not gonna propose during that one song you shouldve took your friend.

Just bc he hasn't been a fan for as long as she has doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to enjoy the show with his partner. \n\nAlso, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but your friend needs to accept that she IS second priority to your partner. That's what happens when you grow up. I understand she's a long term friend but we don't build lives with our friends, we do that with our partners. It's not like you've been dating this guy for 2 weeks. She can't expect you to prioritize them equally. I love my friends but not like I love my husband and if push came to shove there's no question who I would choose. \n\nObviously if you had access to 5 tickets and didn't take them you'd be an AH but that isn't what happened.

I don't think it's unreasonable that OP wants to go with their partner, but it's also not unreasonable that their friend who clearly put a ton of effort into getting them tickets is upset by that decision.\n\nI think the biggest thing OP botched was not letting them know individually before posting online, he definitely should have anticipated his friend would be unhappy and at least tried to smooth things over a little bit. I think the fact that he didn't consider his friend's feelings at all tips it into YTA for me.", "One of my friends did something similar to me but with Ariana Grande. She tried to hide that she went with her BF, but he definitely was making fun of the concert after the fact.", "This isn\u2019t even a normal situation though. I was privy to the catastrophe that was the original ticketmaster drop and let me tell you, I don\u2019t even go to concerts OR really listen to or know taylor swift, but I HAVE had friends trying to get tickets to this or that - this ish was NOT normal. I had totally normal colleagues going insane on their work computers and phones because the codes weren\u2019t working and the website kept crashing. Like if you\u2019ve ever participated in these \u201cdrops\u201d for like snkrs or kylie or whatever - to me this was way worse.  I actually stepped in and tried to help get the tickets because people looked so distressed. \n\nSo yes, if this was some normal concert with a normal entertainer who toured more often, sure, you wanted to take your bf, I get it, still crappy but I get it. \n\nThis was not a normal situation. The taylor ticket debacle really upset a lot of people. Yta and you can say adios to that friendship.", "yeah, coming in I had one question, and it was \"Does your BF care\" and \"Who will get the most enjoyment out of it\"\n\nOP pretty much answered that, and not in a way that makes him sound like a good person.", "Agreed. \n\nMimi is right. You chose your bf over her.  So hopefully you marry him because I doubt your friendship will last much longer.  10 years, thrown away just so you could have sex with your bf in a different state.  \n\nCongrats, OP.  YTA.", "This.. 100% YTA", "Opie, the old saying goes gals before Pals our sisters before misters anyway. Take your best friend and leave the guy to his own devices it's not like he's a big fan so take your long time and very devoted fan slash friend.", "OP said the boyfriend is a fan in the edit. New fans can be big fans.", "Because Mimi was trying to get tickets for a group of five people, and that group plan no longer exists.\n\nWhen it fell apart, it was up to everyone individually to decide whether they were willing to keep putting in the leg work, or if they just wanted to snap their fingers, say \"shucks,\" and move on. \n\nOP found an opportunity for two tickets and he's taking his sweetheart. There's *nothing\ufffc* wrong with that.\n\nIt was one person's back up plan out of a group of five. It is a completely different situation than the initial buying situation.", "Wasn\u2019t she also spending time to do something nice for herself?", "This is perfectly put.\n\nOP, YTA.  Take Mimi to the concert.  Your BF can still come, and go to the cinema/hang out in the hotel, whatever, while you and Mimi see the concert.", "Or just reverse the situation: imagine OP trying hard to score tickets for her best friend and a couple of other friends but can't get them.  Then learning through social media her best friend has 2 found two tickets and is inviting her boyfriend who is not that much into Taylor Swift...  Would OP be upset or would she things that perfectly her friend's right?", "OP just doesn't have a moral compass and I'd be questioning the friendship if I were Mimi", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll so much to find this.

The boyfriend is a fan of TS but only recently. If you phrase it differently then it's a gatekeeper trying to say the younger fan is less deserving of a concert ticket because they haven't listened to the artist for as long. Which is silly.", "Are you single?", "I'm sure it was considering they did nothing wrong at all and the friend is an entitled crybaby\n\nNTA", "Thank you this is spot on imo. An overall NTA but definitely room for reflection on how they communicated to the friend.", "The only logical sane answer here. It\u2019s obvious OPs BF will enjoy himself just as much as Mimi. Sure Mimi is a super fan. But the original plan was for all the friends to go. If OPs relationship is important to him, which it sounds like it is, then this may be a milestone event. Traveling together, sharing a new and exciting experience like a major concert like that, those are the memories that stay with you for a lifetime. I get Mimi is disappointed, she had a right to be, but as adults sometimes priorities change and sometimes you have to make a decision that may not sit well with long time friends. If he\u2019s willing to live with the consequences of not being in Mimi\u2019s good graces than so be it. He may lose a friend or maybe he won\u2019t. I think what\u2019s will ultimately matter is how he decides to maintain his friendship in the wake of prioritizing his relationship with BF over his best friend.\n\nAlso forgot to add I agree. NTA", "this 1000%", "I agree, but I am not sure why you put emphasis on who bought the tickets. I assume that anyone who got a ticket from someone else would reimburse them; surely Miami wasn't going to treat 4 other people to a crazily expensive concert.", "Yeah I\u2019m kinda shocked at the responses here going straight for YTA. But slightly disagree with you. I think NAH. Friend isn\u2019t an asshole for being upset that they weren\u2019t a first option for a ticket, especially when they are best friends. OP isn\u2019t an asshole for giving the ticket to her boyfriend and boyfriend isn\u2019t an asshole for accepting it.", "To be fair this was also poor planning on Mimi and the groups part. The chances of her getting 5 tickets was insane and very likely impossible. She should have tried to get as many as she possibly could even if it just ended up being one. Then everyone else should try hitting up the resale sites/groups. Nothing is stopping any of them to try the same. If you want tickets to such an in demand event you need to divide your efforts and be ruthless/persistant. I wonder how many friendships have been torn apart by this concert?", "I'm amazed honestly by the responses, I usually fully agree with this sub. But yeah, what about the other 2 that are left out? Not everyone was going to be able to go, the original plan was all 5 of them, that plan is out the window now.", "Agreed! Unless there was some kind of understanding between you and Mimi, I don\u2019t see a problem here.", "Had to scroll way too far to find an actually sane take. Thank you for giving me some faith in this subreddit \ud83d\udc4d", "I somewhat agree. I feel like it\u2019s more of a NAH situation. I really don\u2019t understand how op is the ah in the situation. Has no one read the edits where op says that his boyfriend is also a fan of T Swift he\u2019s just a newer fan, which is just as deserving to go to the concert as someone who has been a life long fan. I\u2019m not a fan of Taylor myself so I can\u2019t fathom going through all this trouble for two tickets just to be told I\u2019m an ah for choosing to take my boyfriend instead of a friend. Op bought the tickets and is choosing to take the person he feels he\u2019d have the most fun taking. He\u2019s not an ah for that. I don\u2019t want to say Mimi is an ah for being upset either. She\u2019s allowed to be upset about her friend choosing his boyfriend over her but at the end of the day it\u2019s his decision who he takes", "NTA same. Your friend is acting entitled to YOUR tickets just because she tried to get you one.", "Here for the downvoted as well.\n\nNTA, OP, for all the reasons listed above. Mimi can't gatekeep other fans, and just because your BF is new to Swift doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to go. It sucks that she can't get a ticket but hey, it's a concert not a life-saving organ donation, and it's not like this is a farewell tour or anything.\n\nI know I sound harsh on Mimi, I understand her feelings and her jealousy, but even then she's not thinking about your other two friends who I am guessing are huge fans as well? But is she mad at everyone else who got tickets but aren't superfans? Life is full of these disappointments, unfortunately, and I have missed out on getting tickets to see fave singers/bands who then never toured again. I get it. But it's a first world problem, and I never resented friends who managed to get tickets even when I was arguably the \"bigger\" fan.\n\nBesides, there is nothing stopping you or your other friends from keeping your eyes peeled for more tickets coming available. I know it's super unlikely but you managed it, so you never know.", "Exactly, being a little upset that you can\u2019t go to the concert is one thing but the entitlement coming from mimi is incredibly inappropriate", "Agreed, NTA. I was surprised I had to scroll this far especially since the original group was 5 people, and OP only managed to snag 2 tickets after the fact. \n\nI would also take my partner of 3 years if I only had 2 tickets. They should be taking priority in this situation. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve only been dating a few months.", "I suspect many people on here assume OP is a woman and are trying to play the \u201cchicks before dicks\u201d card. \n\nBut you\u2019re spot on.

Sucks but that\u2019s life.", "Where does this idea that the bf is not a fan come from? Because they're male? So is op", "Oh no a new partner has become the number one in their life because that's how relationships work....\nNta", "There definitely is a lot of super-weird through-the-looking glass groupthink here lately.", "I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I'm on here.

It was a group of 5 who were meant to be going in the first place - I would've expect the couple in the group to end up going together over the best friends", "LMAO! Tell us how you really feel!", "Seems OP feels comfortable with his decision. Maybe not comfortable with losing the friend. He really pulled a jerk move.", "To get laid at the hotel they stay at after lol pathetic", "I feel like everyone saying this is picturing the boyfriend as a straight man.\n\nAnyway, OP has clarified that boyfriend is a fan.

You get the \u201cgoing away\u201d experience with your boyfriend. Your friend and you can really enjoy the Taylor Swift concert and he can hang back at the hotel or do something he wants to do for the night.\n\nI get why OP chose his boyfriend, but also feel for his friend.

I\u2019d be very hurt if I was her.", "Yeah, except there\u2019s a whole group of friends trying to go, and she only had one ticket. So if she takes one friend instead of the other friends, that also makes her the asshole.", "Three things about this really stand out. \n\nThe first is the fact that Mimi was going for five tickets, which must have meaningfully impacted her chances of going because had she just been doing for one or even two, she'd have had more options. \n\nOP didn't even bother to tell her that he got the tickets before screaming to the internet -- in fact says he didn't think of it. \n\nHe wants to go with his boyfriend because that's the experience he wants to have and the impact this would have on his relationship with his best friend is so secondary to that it feels like he's just someone who is very selfish, is used to being very selfish and doesn't really understand the idea that he should ever do anything other than what he most wants to do, no matter who he hurts. \n\nDefinitely YTA. But I'm not sure the OP will ultimately do anything different.", "Definitely.  OP is TA just for the fact of posting on social media first without giving bf the heads up.   That would probably upset me more than anything, just the idea that you are an after-thought and not even considered would really hurt the friendship.", "Agreed. It\u2019s a hard one for me, but I also think it\u2019s reasonable to want to go with his boyfriend and make a trip of it, sucks for Mimi and she\u2019s justified in being annoyed/disappointed, but often times partners do trumps friends. The AH move was not handling it more delicately.\n\nI also get she put a ton of time and effort into getting 5 tickets, but it\u2019s not like OP put a ton of effort into getting 2 tickets by the sounds of it, he got lucky. Again, sucks and feelings are gonna get hurt, but he could have saved himself from being an AH by considering Mimi\u2019s feelings and clueing her in, even if he wasn\u2019t going to take her.", "Agree with this assessment", "The edit is unreal to me. The refusal to accept judgement.", "how is that HIS fault?", "Mimi was getting tickets for a group of them.

I didn't get invited.\n\nI'm not holding a grudge, I hold no ill will. We're still good friends. That's because I understand that for most people, money is a constraint because weddings cost a lot, and beyond social there's familial obligations. If money wasn't an issue, sure - but we all can't be born with a silver spoon.\n\nAnd yes, I understand and agree what you're saying that it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but it paints the picture and if it doesn't get the message across - then your's/OP's way of thinking is goner than I originally thought.", "The wedding is just an analogy to an event which is very important to you and your friend, where you make the decision to exclude your friend in favor of someone who will not care or appreciate it nearly as much \u2014 all because it\u2019s your, uh, thing and you have the power.

Mimi was the only one with access to the site to buy the tickets, otherwise more people would have tried. Mimi was unable to buy tickets. That's one situation that has ended, I honestly don't really feel like it effects the judgement all that much just because she happened to be the only one to get access.\n\nIndependently, after everyone had given up on going, at a time when it was not expected of you to get tickets for everyone or anyone at all, you get lucky enough to get two tickets. \n\nAt this point, if you choose, you can look at it as there is a group of five people who wanted to go, with two tickets. No matter what happens with those two tickets, three people will be left out. At this point, a lot of people have said that your bf isn't really a fan, doesn't care about T Swizzle, would only be going to spend time with you, whatever. To those people, you really couldn't possible know that, and just because he isn't Swift's biggest fan it doesn't invalidate any joy he might get from going or make him any less deserving. What if it's the bf's birthday that day? Or their anniversary? Just as likely as the other hypotheticals a lot of people are working off of at this point.\n\nAnyway, 2 tickets, group of 5 wants to go, and of course you're going because you found and bought them. If you take Mimi, you're blowing off your bf... as well as your other friend of 10 years from middle school and your other friend from college. You could be seen as TA for excluding them. Maybe, MAYBE, if it was only you, bf, and Mimi involved, I could understand some of the comments saying to take Mimi to the concert and have your bf go on the trip with you. But there are still two people left out at that point, they're just being mature about it unlike Mimi so I guess them getting left out is fine, though.\n\nBut ignoring all of that, the situation ISN'T 2 tickets for a group of 5. The group of 5 already got shot down, unable to buy tickets, end of story. To me, that splits it up to everyone being individual. If mimi had found and bought 1 ticket, would you then be entitled to it? Of course not. You found two tickets, and since you're in a relationship with your partner, naturally you thought of them as your second, your more intimate group of two. 2 tickets, group of 2, both of which were a part of the original group of 5. If your bf had never planned to go to begin with, I might also understandthe majority of YTA comments, but that is not the case. \n\nOP, all of this is to say, you are not responsible for your friend's jealousy.

In my opinion, you are NTA, and there are NAH.", "NTA\n\nThis was not part of the original group purchase.  This was a 2 ticket purchase for you and your BF.\n\nHere's an example - your group was planning to go somewhere for spring break.  The plans fell through because tickets weren't available.  You are still able to find tickets for just your and your bf and go on the vacation without the rest of the group.  That does NOT obligate you to take any of the original group on your vacation.\n\nAnd this does sound like a vacation trip.  Having to go out of town and get a hotel, etc.   \n\nMimi is naturally jealous because she wanted to go.  Tell her about the site where you found tickets and maybe she can find tickets too.", "NTA.

But I'd have communicated to my best friend directly to minimize the shock factor.  \n\nMimi sounds like the biggest superfan of the group, and it makes sense she'd feel a certain way if her opportunity to go was given to someone else.  We're all human, and we'd all feel that way to some extent.\n\nHowever, I'd also ask myself if Mimi had obtained 2 tickets, who would she have taken?  If it wasn't the OP, then she really has no ground to stand on.  And to be fair, OP can pick who he wants to take.  But I do think it's an ahole move to not take the best friend bc it obviously means more to her.", "I think taking your bf is the right choice but the way you went about it is asshole like.

Sure, Mimi can be upset and that's fine (i would have told her personally and not let her find out via social media tho) but calling you an asshole for saying \"hey i really want to have this experience with my BF since i got him to like Taylor\" is 100% fine. You shouldnt be judged an asshole for that. You paid for the tickets, you decide who you want to bring, friend can be butthurt all she likes but it's a silly hill to die on.

Of course you would want to share this experience with him.", "She was trying to buy 5 tickets, so if she were to get 2 herself, 3 other people would still have been left out no matter what.  \n\n\nSo, there is a 75% chance that if the friend got 2 tickets, OP wouldn't have gotten the other ticket.", "What if our answer is \"Honestly would understand that their SO takes priority. Time for me to look for tickets with someone else.\"?", "But OP wants to experience this with his bf. Why can\u2019t he choose who he\u2019s going with?

I hope you get bonus songs you don\u2019t like.", "Yta. Very involved in the pre-sale and I can't say I'd want to talk to you after that.", "No he didn\u2019t. This is absolutely NTA. If the friend has a problem with him going with his partner then she is issue and not a good friend.", "This sub recently is on a role of worst YTA takes ever. I imagine everyone here who are giving their YTA takes just didn't get tickets to the TS concert too and wanted to go. Or else these YTA takes make no sense. \n\nThe thing I find most annoying is how everyone is like OP can go on a trip with his BF and mini but then take mini to the concert like !!!!!!!!! OP wants to spend time alone with his BF. Which part of this is not clear to everyone here. He wants it to be their romantic moment. \n\nAnd this whole but the BF isn't even a fan. Well he was also going in the original plan. The BF isn't being forced to attend this concert, he wants to go. He does not hate TS and he is also not indifferent about this. He clearly wanted to go before too. He doesn't have to be the biggest swiftie in life to go to a concert. OP did mention that he likes few of the songs and TS is considered to be an amazing performer and this is a pretty big scale tour. The BF might also want to go just to experience the whole thing. He might also want to experience this thing with his partner. This could be their romantic getaway activity. Why should they give it away just because they know a friend who is a bigger Swiftie. \n\nSure Mini is a big Swiftie and it'll be amazing if she got to go but that doesn't mean this is some fucking competition where only the biggest fans get to go. That's not how this works. Anyone can go to a concert. Big fans, new fans, folks who are just going for the experience and spectacle, folks who are accompanying loved ones. Every single one of them has the right. \n\nThe whole but I'm a bigger fan so you should take me is gatekeeping. \n\nAnd the OH plan was for Mini to get tickets because she was the one who had the fan code. Whosoever had the fan code would have tried. That was the OG plan during the initial ticketing phase. No one said that after the plan failed they are responsible for still securing tickets for each other. \n\nIt sucks for Mini but OP got lucky and he wants to spend time with his BF. \n\nI would say either NAH or NTA but definitely not YTA.", "I don\u2019t think you understand the situation.

It\u2019s a THREE YEAR relationship not a 6 month relationship. The amount of people diminishing their relationship because \u201che\u2019s just a boyfriend\u201d is insane.

OP only read this response. The rest of the people in this thread are just projecting or being petty.", "Thank you!! This is an excellent analysis of the situation and I can't believe I had to scroll this far.

Idk if its because clearly these people are younger then me and I'm married, but 100% my partner gets priority over my friends. My friends know that. I like football, my wife tolerates football.

Friendships are important too.", "Let me flip it on you, though, and say it's actually super meaningful to share something you love with your partner, especially if they are open to the experience.

Seeing them get wowwed by things that I have seen/heard a hundred times. Being able to explain the backstory to aspects of the performance. etc", "The boyfriend is just a fan now cuz he knows it's a hot ticket. \n\nAlso, OP's friend probably could have gotten 1-2 tickets. She only missed out because she was trying to buy 5.", "This! I went to see Taylor solo and a lot of people around me weren't superfans (partners, parents, fans of only one or two albums) and the vibe was a little off.", "Exactly. No matter what OP chose, someone is going to be upset because there is only 2 tickets and 5 people who originally planned to go. Also, people are acting like Mimi or whatever was trying to buy tickets all day for just her and OP and therefore was owed his other ticket, when in reality it was a group outing. She was trying to get tickets for everyone, not just them two.\n\nOverall, I don't think OP is TA for taking his boyfriend to the concert, but I do think the way he went about it was shitty. He should have told mimi privately before posting on socials. On the other hand I also understand why Mimi is upset.", "Right I have tickets for next weekend and even though my partner is actually closer to the friends I'm going with than I am, she's not coming because she's just a casual fan and doesn't care that much while the three of us have been planning our outfits for months.", "1, OP is a man, in a relationship with another man. 2, bf IS in fact a fan of Taylor Swift. Just because he became a fan more recently doesn't mean he shouldn't get to go!", "This is a  gay couple who both are fans of ts\nThe bf is just a newer fan \n\nI'd dump a bf who didn't take me", "What does that have to do with a gay couple who both like Taylor swift ?", "Actually, OP's boyfriend is ALSO a Taylor fan, and wants to attend the concert with his boyfriend!  \ud83d\ude43", "Are we reading the same thing? \n\nThe fact is, Mimi tried to get tickets for 5 of them and spent an entire day trying to. If she bought a ticket for just herself she would've likely gotten one using HER fancode.... getting 5 tickets for big artists like TS is literally impossible.", "Pretty much will drop that guy in a heart beat.

I felt bad for her, especially since I was visibly having the time of my life a row ahead of her.", "I\u2019d be shocked if you have ever been in a loving relationship with the way you talk about partners. My girlfriend is my best friend. I want to share experiences with her. You\u2019ll understand someday.", "Totally. There\u2019s obviously a balance (having a friend who is attached at the hip to their partner is exhausting) but I think many of these responses are misandrist in nature. Curious how the responses would feel if OP was a dude taking his girlfriend and his guy friend who was a huge swifty was upset.", "You actually bring up a good point, but you are using it in the wrong sense. Our relationships do exist in a hierarchal nature. The key to healthy relationships though is that order needs to shift depending on context. Always putting your partner first is not healthy and it comes at a steep cost of destroying safety nets. We are social creatures and we generally can't actually get all our needs met from a single individual. It's important to have even a tiny circle to get emotional and mental needs met. But if you always put your partner first, you prove how little energy you are willing to give to others, and they will often respond in kind. Which means you don't have anyone but your partner and that will become very draining on them. Obviously the partner will have the top slot a disproportionate amount of time. But unless you are one of the rare people who does only need one person for everything, its setting yourself up for a rough time and unduly burdening your partner.", "Agreed", "Right? The only thing that I think he did wrong was posting it to his socials without telling her before hand. He should have just gently explained what happened and that he randomly was able to get 2 tickets. I think she maybe would have taken it a lot better instead of seeing a \"omg me and bae are going to taylor swift!!!!\" post online.", "People are assuming that OP's BF is uninterested in the concert. They're glossing over the fact that OP is a man and his BF is also a fan that wants to go. It's very much NAH imo.", "Except that he wants to go. They listen to the music together, he enjoys it. What is a win for the BF is to to go a concert he\u2019ll enjoy with his significant other.\n\nIt\u2019s just that the BFF is a \u201csuper fan\u201d so feels they\u2019re more entitled because they liked them first.", "BECAUSE HE ALSO WANTS TO SEE TAYLOR SWIFT.", "My boyfriend offered to drive me and my friend and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been more in love with him. Battling that traffic and that crowd to make sure we weren\u2019t standing in an Uber line for four hours? Lemme have your babies.", "The edit wasn't there when my comment was made. At the time it wasn't clear that OPs bf was also a fan, and so me and the person I was replying to were wondering why someone who may be ambivalent toward the experience wouldn't step aside. With the additional details, it casts things in a different light", "If dragging someone to a concert they won\u2019t enjoy is something you like to do, why do you care what a stranger on Reddit thinks??? \n\nYour girlfriend is your best friend, great. What about your other friends? Do you just prioritize her? That\u2019s my point. It\u2019s fucking shitty to put your significant other above everyone else in your life. \n\nYou can have room in your life for love and friendship, but some people only prioritize the former. You can keep speculating about my love life if you want, but it just makes you seem like a miserable asshole.", "The partner wants to go the concert so I don't think this applies here.", "Nope, sorry, but Mimi is being entitled af. What about the other friends who couldn't go? Doesn't sound like she's kicking up a fuss for them. No, she's mad that *she's* not getting a ticket that *OP* paid for. OP can take who he wants, like damn. It doesn't matter how long they've been friends or how hard she tried to get tickets. Would it have been nice if all five of the group could've gone together? Of course, but that's just not how it turned out. Why wasn't Mimi hitting up the resale sites like OP? If she's such a massive fan, she should've had feelers out for all that shit.", "Also, the whole take the BF and mini both in a trip and then take Mini to the concert is just such a terrible suggestion. OP clearly wants a romantic getaway with his BF and wants to turn into something romantic and everyone here is like what about Mini. \n\nAlso, BF was part of the OG group too. He isn't being forced into this. He wanted to go before and wants to go now. Just because Mini is a bigger fan doesn't mean she has somehow more right. I understand her pain but anyone and everyone can go to a concert. She doesn't deserve this any more than others. NAH really", "I think there\u2019s also a mentality with the Taylor Swift super fans that if you don\u2019t know every song and every word or think that everything she touches is gold, you\u2019re not a fan.\n\nIt\u2019s been wild watching the tour unfold and her insane base on twitter and TikTok.", "But that was for a group outing. She didn't sit there and try and get two tickets for her and OP. Because of this and the fact that OP only got 2 tickets,  no matter what someone was going to be upset and left out because there were 5 people originally planning to go and only 2 tickets now. I don't think OP is an asshole for taking his boyfriend.. but I do think he is an asshole for not telling mimi and explaining, and instead just posting on socials and letting her find out that way.", "You\u2019re amusing.

Go ahead bud.", "Lol I totally get it but that's not -actually- reasonable outside of middle school \ud83d\ude05 \n\nAll I'm saying is I only know a few songs but  if my sig other didn't take me on this out of state hotel.room mini romance  vacation concert fun date I'd  dump him lol", "I was speaking generally, because you brought up YOUR girlfriend. You didn\u2019t say shit about OP. \n\nEither way, OP\u2019s boyfriend is barely a fan of Taylor Swift, and it seems like they only listen to her because of OP. Doesn\u2019t sound like someone who will have an incredible time at a three and a half hour concert.", "And reputation is secretly a whole ass love album!!!", "Exactly! There\u2019s also an album called Reputation with a song on it called Dress. Actually, every single album has love songs. Even 1989, with Style, which is a post romance/reminiscence song, but it\u2019s not a slam. Taylor writes from her heart, so breakups will be there, along with the songs she wrote when the love was still good.", "Bad Blood", "OP didn't listen closely enough to \"Karma\".", "You can stop projecting any time bud. You were wrong. Thanks for participating", "Reputation is my personal favourite. I Did Something Bad and King of My Heart \ud83d\udc97", "Dancing With Our Hands Tied, Call It What You Want, and Dress for me. Just omggggggg. Gotta go watch rep tour on Netflix again.", "I love seven. I never used to be a Taylor swift fan before. I heard her songs on the radio or whatever and that was it. When folklore and evermore came out, I actually listened to the whole thing and then I started doing some digging into taylor and the meaning of her songs and her overall story. It actually gave me a lot more respect for her as a person and an artist. Those two albums are still my favourite, just because I prefer the more alt-folksy vibe of it more than her usual pop radio stuff. But I can appreciate all of her music overall more now too.", "NTA. I'm editing this because some of the comments made me change my mind. I'm going with NTA only because you can choose who you want to take and that is your right. That being said you acknowledge that she worked really hard to get you tickets and once you get a ticket you can give to her you give it to you bf who doesn't even like Taylor? Taylor's been famous for the past 15 years and your bf has only listened to her last album? That's not a fan and you had to make him listen. If you wanted your bf to come why not just stay at a hotel for a few days before the concert with him and instead of him going to the concert he stays in the hotel while you and your friend go to the concert. I got a question did you at least consider taking your friend and decide on taking you bf or was she never even a factor? \n\nI will say the friend should not have talked to you the way she did. I need you to acknowledge that she was upset at being swept to the side. She probably feels as if you do not value her. She is thinking the friendship is one sided. Now once again I do not think it is wrong to take your bf to the concert instead of your friend. I get you may have wanted some alone time with him, but you should have also considered your friend at the least.", "YTA and I\u2019m saying this as someone who is occasionally too joined at the hip with her sweetie. This is like me going to a Bianca del Rio show or a Black Flag show without my bestie.. I would not do it. She\u2019s more important than any show. I would not think about doing it but I would have fleeting regret about us both missing it.", "YTA mainly for announcing publicly and not informing your friend privately first. You are entitled to not take her and she would have been entitled to be disappointed. Also a smaller YTA for prioritising a regular fan over a super fan.", "YTA and you're punishing yourself.  I went to the tour with a Swiftie-bestie,  and it was the best experience. 1 row ahead of us was a fan standing and singing (but clearly holding back his excitement)  with a date or boyfriend who clearly didn't care about the show.  They left early and unhappy. \n\nIf tickets were easier to get, I'd understand making it a date, but the shared pain of fighting for seats for this tour means you hook your fellow Swifties up.", "NTA. You were lucky that you got tickets and as someone who has friends who got tickets but didn\u2019t get them herself, she was very entitled to think that SHE out of all 4 of the other people who wanted tickets, is the one that should have it. She basically demanded that it should have been her and it wasn\u2019t fair because it\u2019s so important blah blah blah. I\u2019ve been a Taylor fan for 15 years and I wanted to go SO BAD, but I know the demand is crazy and I\u2019m broke asf so chances were I wasn\u2019t going to be going. \n\nI will say, she might just be reacting out of frustration and taking it out on you. To be so invested in something and have gotten so close, to then one of her friends who \u201cdoesn\u2019t care as much\u201d to be going and taking her boyfriend who is a \u201cnew fan\u201d, she might see that as being unfair. Don\u2019t feel bad you\u2019re going with him. But also don\u2019t be surprised if you lose a friend. Kinda crazy to think that this would end a friendship, but she\u2019s probably thinking that you knew how important it was to her and that you would care enough about her to take her instead of your boyfriend. It\u2019s THAT big of a deal to her. So maybe mull it over. Up to you.", "I\u2019m gonna go against the grain and say NTA. You had an opportunity to get only two tickets after plans fell through and it\u2019s your choice who you want to go with.

She found out on social media which is why I think she\u2019s kicked off. \n\nHope you can patch things up with your friend. \n\nNTA.", "Your friend should get over it. She can watch the concert on TV and stop acting entitled to the tickets", "NTA. As someone who has truly become a Lady Gaga fan because of my partner, listening to music with someone that I spent a lot of time with regularly, like a significant other, played a huge factor into my interests. Also, concert-going can be such a formative experience in any relationship, but personally I\u2019d find it more meaningful with a significant other especially if travel is involved.\n\nMimi\u2019s frustration and sadness is valid and she can react however she feels is necessary to process her emotions. But OP is not inherently an AH for wanting to travel and see the show with a significant other. \n\nMaintaining important relationships outside of a romantic one is key to balanced life, however, when life throws you a curveball or unexpected opportunity, sometimes the circumstances lead you to prioritize some people over others.", "The top comments are reinforcing my belief that Taylor Swift fans are brain damaged. The original plan was whoever got the verified fan thing would get tickets for all. That fell through. You all thought you weren't going. A while later by some chance you are only able to get 2.

You found two, and decided you\u2019d be more comfortable going with your partner.

You are not responsible for someone else\u2019s feelings. Her feelings are valid, but to put the blame on you and make you feel shitty for her own reaction is not right. She is emotionally immature. You made a decision, she has to respect that.\nEveryone saying you should have messaged her about getting the tickets, bullshit. Again, you got them for yourself and were excited. The post was enough notification about the tickets. You don\u2019t need to message everyone individually about your choices.\nAlso, most important part (in my opinion), you\u2019re allowed to have boundaries with your friends regarding your relationship.

Unless your friends are mouth breathers, they'll probably still find out.", "This sounds like another one of those fun Reddit posts where OP thinks she is 100% right and types out her perfectly reasonable explanation thinking she is 100% right and is flabbergasted that she is not 100% right.", "It's a tough situation and while I do understand where the other verdicts are coming from, I still think YTA. At the very least, you're the YTA for not communicating privately with your best friend and other people in the group before posting on social media. That's just callous. \n\nI mean - think about it. You're a huge fan, you want to go so badly, and you spend all day trying to get tickets for everyone. And then you find you out, via social media, that your supposed best friend of 10 years is bragging about scoring tickets and is taking his boyfriend instead of you and didn't even bother to let you know. Of course you'd feel upset. \n\nI understand why you might want to go with your partner, and I also understand that in situation where a group of 5 want to go to something, but there's only two tickets, someone is going to feel left out and there's no real way around that. But I can't help but feel like, even if your bf is a \"new fan,\" he might be just as happy going on a different getaway with you, whereas your friend clearly wants to see Taylor Swift and put in a lot of effort to make that happen, possibly even sacrificing her chance at getting a single or smaller number of tickets so everyone could be included. Also, at age 23, having a best friend of 10 years is rare, so personally I'd take my friend for those reasons. But if you really wanted to take your bf, I think the emotionally intelligent thing to do would be to talk to Mimi about it privately, express your reasons, thank her for her efforts, and plan something else with her that's also meaningful. Yes, they are your tickets and you have the right to decide who you take, but can you really blame her for being upset? If you were in her shoes, wouldn't you feel burned?", "Going against the grain here\n\nNTA \n\nYou bought the tickets you choose who you take. You didn\u2019t promise to take her. Yes it sucks she can\u2019t go but that\u2019s life.", "Very strongly NTA\n\nI would chose my partner over my friend in this situation. You are a couple so it's ok to prioritize your significant other if you feel like it. The people commenting in this post are just absurd, and they act like they were never in a relationship. If my best friend would chose his significant other I would understand. It's the normal flow of life. You are not going to live your whole life with your bff, but you can live your life with your partner if you feel like it.", "YTA for the simple reason that you posted it on social media instead of telling her. \n\nYou could have been. Hey I found some in resale but since it\u2019s out of state my bf who was planning on going anyway would love to go. \n\nBut even then. She is the bigger fan. Your bf just became a fan or so you say. For a concert I would choose the biggest fan. Go in a trip with your bf another time.\n\n Curious. Since this happened what does bf think ?? He feels regretful or oh well too bad for her.", "Nta, these are rabid Swifties in the comments guaranteed.  Your tickets, you get to choose who to take.  End of discussion", "NTA, \n\nYes it sucks that as a group they all originally wanted to get tickets together. However things didn\u2019t go as plan OP finally got a chance to get tickets to the show and it was only 2. In situations like this of course someone is going to have their feelings hurt because they want to be the one picked to go. However, OP secured these tickets, OP brought these tickets with their own money, therefore OP is entitled to picking who goes with him.\n\n Lastly being OP should not be guilted by other people because they didn\u2019t get picked. OP don\u2019t feel bad", "NTA Seems like your friend is being hurt from jealousy since you got lucky and didn\u2019t take her. You got the tickets, you get to decide who you go with. \n\nGoing with your BF is something YOU want. If you got guilted into going with your BFF instead, I don\u2019t think you would have a good time since you would feel like you were forced into that situation.\n\nIn the end it\u2019s going to be a 1 on 1 trip to see the concert. Definitely not an asshole for wanting to spend that 1 on 1 with with a SO instead of a friend. Don\u2019t let people shit on your companion preference. Clearly you value the BF more than the friend and that is completely fine.", "Long term partner > friends in most situations, including this. I adore my friends, but I am in live with my partner and love reasons to spend time with them. It is your money, it was you who found the tickets, and 3 were always going to miss out regardless of who you chose. Choosing your partner makes sense logically, especially if you're gonna be traveling w them. NTA", "Even after her edit she sounds like she\u2019s trying to come up with excuses.\n\u201cOmg noooooo my boyfriend is a fan!!!! He\u2019s been a fan for so long ever since the release of her last album\u201d which was basically half a year ago \ud83d\udc80 versus her friend who\u2019s a die hard fan. Let\u2019s be for fucking real OP, your boyfriend is NOT a fan. Just say it like it is\u2026with me now\u2026.\u201dI prefer my boyfriend over my friend.\u201d No shame in admitting it. Just shame in you choosing him over your best friend. And yes, YTA. I\u2019d be so disappointed in you if you were my best friend.", "Yeah, can't believe I'm saying this, but YTA. Believe me, I would normally say your ticket, your choice. But my man - she's your best friend and spent ALL DAY trying to get you a ticket. This would mean the world to her. Your BF is a casual fan at most. As a TS fan myself, but not a die-hard, I'm willing to wager that sure, he'll have a good time, but he'd probably have as good a time doing any other number of things. Have you even told him the situation? In his place I would insist that you take your friend over me. \n\nI really think you should take your friend, and do something else special with your BF.", "only OP's answer is relevant tho", "I think OP\u2019s mistake was announcing it on social media before telling their friends that he and his BF managed to get tickets and were going. OP probably could have guessed Mimi would be upset for not being offered the second ticket.\n\nHowever, the friend is not entitled to the second ticket just because they are huge Taylor Swift fans. It sounded to me like once the friend was unable to get tickets for the 5 friends with her code, they did not come with a plan for someone else to look for tickets. So I would have taken this to be an \u201ceach man for himself\u201d situation.\n\nFinding 2 tickets and giving the second ticket to their partner who also likes the artist is normal couple behavior.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s **NTA**", "If you want your comment to be legible, please just delete all the female pronouns instead of striking them through. Reading this made my headache worse.", "If my wife was a taylor swift fan and got two tickets, Id be the first one telling her to take anyone but myself lol.", "It is both what u/Shadow_Of_Erebus said, and and because people are talking like Mimi *was* going to pay for these tickets out of her own pocket, so I talked as if that were the case just to show that it was *still ridiculous* to say that she in any way was entitled to or owed a ticket just for standing in line, or that she deserves to have one more that OP or OP's BF.", "It feels like there is a lot of highschool mentality of friends before boyfriends. But as you get older and if you are traveling out of state, personally I would rather travel with my partner and should be seen as okay to select your partner of 3 years over a friend. Obviously we all have different priorities in life but it doesn't make you an A H for choosing your boyfriend when you only get plus 1.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see Mimi standing up for the other friends that are left out, and it makes it seem like Mimi would fully throw the other friends under the bus to see Taylor for herself.\n\nOP said her and her friends are 23? Her friends need to grow up.", "Because of the way OP described the bf vs. bff. There's been edits to it also stating that the bf is a \"new\" fan, but based on the initial word choices and sentence structure - it's not communicated as a big fanatic as the way OP described the bff.\n\nThe word like and fan are subjective. I like Taylor. I'm a fan. But if I had to choose between Sheeran and Taylor, I'd dump her in a heartbeat. Do I listen to Taylor often? Nope. Is she on my playlist? Yes. Do I sometimes skip her song when it comes on? Yes.", "OP is more interested in going on a trip with his boyfriend to another state. Then he is about taking his friend who's a super fan to a concert even though the super fan had been originally trying to get him tickets. Yeah this is about a date trip!", "But her best friend the 1 friend who spent the entire day on the internet should have been who she asked to go.   It took us literally the whole day to get our tickets online.  We spend from time it started to about 4 pm before we had tickets.  \n It\u2019s a shitty what hung to do to your friend.", "Nope, I think the other friends would understand taking the one who was trying so hard to get them tickets.", "Yeah but this was her bestie", "Agreed, love my friends but I prioritize my partner.", "I mean you could spin that back around: \"A best friend would prioritize taking their best friend to a concert with their favorite artist\" or w/e.", "it worked out for my friends and I in the end, but it was a long, difficult process to get 5 tickets. if none of us had gotten tickets during presale, but my friend got two tickets later and went with her bf (who knows some taylor, but only bc of my friend) instead of me (or even one of our other friends who are basically lifelong taylor fans), I would have felt betrayed. \n\nwould I have reacted exactly the way mimi did? probably not, but I would be upset. taylor is one of the main things we bonded over and we've both been fans since 2006, but never seen her in concert. we've grown up with taylor, and to take someone else who wouldn't care as much instead of me would tell me that our years of friendship and bond meant less to her than getting to say she saw taylor with her bf.", "Ya - I agree that it wasn't inherently wrong for OP to take his bf, he just fumbled on the delivery and is now dealing with the fallout as this situation required more sensitivity than he realized at the time.", "but its not a tie because OP and mimi never made a new plan to get tickets. its not like OP said \"ill check the resale sites everyday and if i find a pair we will go together!\" and then ditched her. mimi just assumed that because OP managed to get resale tickets she should get to go. mimi has the exact same access to resell sites that OP has", "I mean, ok. Yeah OP didn\u2019t do anything \u201cwrong\u201d per se. But nobody likes friends who treat them that way. Mimi spent a day trying to get tickets for a group, including OP. And then she had to find out OP got tickets through social media. Sorry to say, but whatever the \u201ccorrect\u201d decision is, you\u2019re not going to have very many friends if that\u2019s how you treat them."]}
