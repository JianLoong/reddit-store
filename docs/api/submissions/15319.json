I have also been best friends with my friend let's call her Mimi (23f) since we were 13, we have a lot history and are very good friends. Now back when the tickets for Taylor originally dropped we did not get a verified fan code so we weren't able to access the website to purchase tickets. However Mimi did receive one and she spent the entire day of the drop trying to get tickets for all of us but was unfortunately unable to do so. We were all upset but understood how difficult it was and how hard she tried. We had given up on getting tickets untill about last week where i happen to get insanely lucky on a resale website and was able to snag 2 tickets. I decided to take my partner because I wanted to share this occasion with his especially since we'd have to be traveling to a different state. When I posted on social media about the tickets and how excited i was my friend messaged me upset calling me an asshole for not taking her. She says that she had been trying super hard to get tickets because it would be her first concert and she's literally the biggest fan i know. She callede an asshole saying that i should be taking her instead because my boyfriend isn't really a fan which is partially true he's really only listened to her since her newest album dropped because of me. She is saying that I'm essentially picking him over her friendship because i knew how important this was to her. She is now not speaking to me because she thinks it's unfair and she feels like im choosing him over her. However i just feel like this is an experience I'd prefer to have with my partner than with my friend. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Editing to include the fact that Mimi was not just trying to buy tickets for herself and I there was 5 people in the group. There is group of 3 of us that have been friends since middle school. My partner and 1 other friend that we met in college who were close with make up the 5. She was the only one trying to get tickets on ticketmaster because she was the only one who got a fan code but it would have been whoever got a code that would have been securing the tickets not specifically her. As someone stated in a comment no matter what happened 3 people would have been left out. Also another clarification for those who haven't been involved in the Taylor swift resale situation. When you're buying resale (i worded it wrong originally it wasn't a website it was a group) you don't get to pick how many tickets you're purchasing. Someone will just say hey I'm selling x amount of tickets to this place on this date and you buy them if you can. Honestly like i said we'd all kind of given up hope we'd get tickets because of how difficult it was so when I saw the two i didn't think twice about purchasing them just because it wasn't 5. Chances of finding 5 together this close to the concert is practically impossible. I do see and understand i probably should have told our friends privately i was just way too excited and didn't think about it. Also my boyfriend is a fan! I wouldn't be dragging him there. He would definitely enjoy himself. He just hasn't really listened to her but when her newest album came out I introduced him to more of her music and we listen to her all he time he just happens to be a newer fan.", "created_utc": 1682063348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tub34/aita_for_taking_my_bf_to_the_taylor_swift_concert/", "score": 760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to hurt her feelings and shes is probably being a bit rash atm.

And, ultimately, you bought your tickets with your own money and are allowed to use your money \nhowever you want.\n\nOn the other hand, it sounds like Mimi tried hard to find tickets for everyone.

Or was it okay enough for you to go with her at that point?\n\nSure, we've all been there, love is cool and everything, but your friends are there for the long run, even when a relationship has run its course.

You are now 23. Mimi, sadly, remains 13.", "I don't care what everyone else is saying here.

That didn't pan out.\n\nYou found 2 tickets so you snapped them up for you and your boyfriend. Simple. It's unfortunate that you couldn't  get more, but I'm certain that if you could have procured your friend a ticket, you would have. That doesn't make you an AH. Your boyfriend has been your significant other for 3 years, long enough for them to be a priority in a situation like this.\n\nThe fact that your friend is getting this upset about going to see a multimillionaire perform for money and throwing a major wrench into your friendship over this is what's crazy. Taylor Swift is young. She's going to have more world tours. This isn't worth potentially ruining such a long term friendship over and I hope your friend realises this and apologises to you.\n\nGo to the concert, enjoy the trip and have a great time.

Make a couple of days of it, if work and finances allow.

He\u2019s not even a fan.", "YTA Taylor would be ashamed of you", "Honestly, I was going to ask for more details, but I think regardless of the answers to my question that you're NTA. You got the tickets, your friend group wanted to go but you want to go with your BF and you decided to go with him. That doesn't make you an asshole, it makes you a lucky someone that managed to get ahold of 2 tickets instead of 5. Your friend is upset and disappointed, which is understandable, but hopefully this doesn't break your friendship\n\nI have two reasons for this judgement:\n\n1. The argument that Mimi deserves to get the ticket because she was going to get everyone tickets isn't a good argument at all because boils down to \"*Mimi deserves the ticket because she was the one that got the code.\".* It completely ignores the fact that 'being willing to get everyone tickets' is true of yourself, your boyfriend and the other two friends involved in the plans to try and get these tickets. All of you were trying to get the code and all of you were willing to try and secure tickets for everyone else if you did get the code. Just to show how ridiculous that argument is, let me present the following scenario: Mimi and your boyfriend both got a verified fan code, but your boyfriend could only secure 2 tickets with that fan code. If we follow the argument that is being used for why Mimi deserves one of the tickets that you bought, then in this scenario it means that your boyfriend would be expected to give Mimi one of the 2 tickets he got. What happens to the other? There are several options\n   1. He goes to the concert with Mimi. He bought the ticket so he absolutely does deserve to go, but I think everyone here would agree that it's kind of weird to go to a concert that your Bf/GF wants to go to not with them, but with their best friend.\n   2. He gives you the ticket so that you can go with Mimi. It'd be nice for you and Mimi, but disappointing for him since he's the one that bought both tickets and he doesn't even get to go enjoy the concert.\n   3. He gives one of the other two friends the ticket. How is he going to choose? What would be fair, do they just draw straws and whoever gets the longest straw gets the ticket? Cool, Mimi and that friend get to go to the concert....that he paid for. Are they going to pay him back? Would you have been disappointed that your boyfriend didn't give you one of the two tickets since he gave them both away?\n   4. Since Mimi was the only other person to get the verified code, maybe she and your boyfriend are really the only people that get to choose which of you 5 get to go. So if he's not going to go, and he can't choose whether to give you the other ticket or to give it to one of the other two friends, maybe he just gives them both to Mimi and she gets to choose who gets to accompany her to the concert....that your boyfriend paid for.\n   5. Since he can only get 2 tickets and Mimi isn't able to get any for anyone else, he foregoes getting the tickets and no one goes to the concert.\n2. Being a fan of something for less time than someone else doesn't make them any less of a fan nor does it mean they're \"not a true fan\". They're just a **new** fan, and being a new fan or \"less\" of a fan doesn't mean they are any less deserving of a ticket than a massive long-time fan. If your boyfriend wants to go - genuinely wants to go and not \"wants to go because it makes you happy\" - if he would enjoy going, then he deserves to go just as much as Mimi does. And the people saying that he's \"not a real fan\" just because he's new to her music? You're the same as the dipshits that accuse women in game or comic stores of being \"fake fans\" if they don't know the answers to every question they get asked about the game or comic they're trying to buy.\n\nI think what you are an AH for, though, is for letting her find out over social media that you got two tickets and were going with your boyfriend. She probably would've still been upset (and it's fine for her to be upset and disappointed, just like it's fine for you to choose to go with your BF instead of her), but at least she would have found out directly from you rather than getting the whiplash of seeing it on social media.", "NTA fully going against the grain on this one.\n\nMimi tried to get tickets for all 3 of you but had no luck.\n\nYou got lucky and managed to get 2 tickets.\n\nIt's entirely up to you who you take then. Yes Mimi will miss out and that's a shame but that is all. \n\nYour partner may become your husband in the future and no matter what anyone else says, your partner should always take priority over friends because they are the one you will build a life and future with. Love for a partner is different than that of a friend so ofcourse you will choose them first.", "I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be impressed if mimi got you a ticket and decided to give it to someone else.\n\nI\u2019d be surprised if your friendship hadn\u2019t been ruined over this choice.\n\nYTA.", "YTA lol he\u2019s not gonna propose during that one song you shouldve took your friend.

Mimi deserves a better friend", "YTA, mostly because of the way you handled it and her finding out. You had to post it eh? Did you get the attention and likes that you hoped for? Youre original plan was to go as a group, not to have a night with your bf.

It's also super lame that she's trying to guilt trip you and is essentially gatekeeping one of the most popular musicians in the world with her whole \"your bf isn't a real fan\" perspective. Just bc he hasn't been a fan for as long as she has doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to enjoy the show with his partner. \n\nAlso, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but your friend needs to accept that she IS second priority to your partner. That's what happens when you grow up. I understand she's a long term friend but we don't build lives with our friends, we do that with our partners. It's not like you've been dating this guy for 2 weeks. She can't expect you to prioritize them equally. I love my friends but not like I love my husband and if push came to shove there's no question who I would choose. \n\nObviously if you had access to 5 tickets and didn't take them you'd be an AH but that isn't what happened.

It was a lottery of people who signed up, and has no bearing at all on how big of a fan you are or were. It was truly randomized and the only info they had was name and email", "Or hell, got 3 tickets and kicked out op and her bf because he didn't care about the show?", "If you didn\u2019t even attempt to sit on Ticketmaster, you\u2019re automatically disqualified IMHO", "Taylor Swift. With the lineups for merch/getting through the door and the opening act, plus her own 3 hour set, it absolutely would be an all day event. Why bring someone only mildly interested when you know you\u2019re gonna be on your feet most of the night?", "It's not about obsession. It's the fact that she was booking tickets for everyone, OP included but as soon as OP got it, he decided to take his partner and announce it on social media w/o telling her/informing her.", "I think the person you replied to is saying that Taylor Swift would have more fun with a super fan who knows her songs? Lol it doesn\u2019t really make sense either way.", "This is the way. I went on a trip pretty much exactly like this with my husband and best friend last month. Me and Bestie went to the riot girl show of our dreams, and Hubz wandered around the city and found a good late-night spot for us to get some food after our show let out. Everyone was happy.", "I like this idea. But I'm guessing OP wants to be AT concert with boyfriend. I don't listen to Taylor Swift purposefully (the songs are ubiquitous, so I hear her, just don't know lyrics), but I'm assuming there are romantic songs that would be bf/gf appropriate.", "I agree. I just assumed because they were pretty busy getting the tickets and pretty hyped to go. I imagined he said something like 'Mimi got the code but unfortunately not the tickets and we were dissapointed'. But anyway, it's OP's fault.\nEdit: I switched the gender.

While I agree OP has the last say to who he gets to go with, it's an AH move when you know how much it means to a person that you care about and are able to make it happen and still choose not to make it happen.", "Op admits the bf isn't really a fan though and only really listens to Taylor Swift because of him. That's somewhat different than saying \"I'm a bigger fan because I liked this longer\", it's \"I'm the actual fan of the artist your bf only really listens to because of you\". Also Mimi potentially missed out on the chance of getting herself a ticket because she was trying to get tickets for everyone else too. 1 or 2 tickets are much easier to get in a ticket scramble like that than 5 tickets.", "Agree! The people who are mad are all taylor swift fans bc they\u2019d be mad if it was them. But ops best friend is not entitled to the ticket bc she\u2019s a big fan. He always wanted his bf to go and it\u2019s a long term relationship, if it were me I\u2019d also pick my boyfriend I\u2019m sorry but I want those experiences with him and obviously op feels the same way.", "Yea, I also feel like this. If my buddy of 25 years, who I\u2019ve known since I was 6, nabbed two tickets to music we both like and took his serious gf instead of me\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t think twice about it.\n\nCan\u2019t understand people who would throw away a friendship over concert tickets.", "Crazy that lukewarm takes like this are getting downvoted. Dude wants to make some memories with his long term partner, that's not a sin. Since there's 5 people 3 always had to be excluded. BFF is allowed to be upset over it but trying to force it into an \"it's either me or him\" situation is uncalled for. NTA", "She can be upset that she\u2019s not going but to hold it against op is wrong. You\u2019re allowed to pick your relationship there\u2019s nothing wrong with that"]}
