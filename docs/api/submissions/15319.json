I have also been best friends with my friend let's call her Mimi (23f) since we were 13, we have a lot history and are very good friends. Now back when the tickets for Taylor originally dropped we did not get a verified fan code so we weren't able to access the website to purchase tickets. However Mimi did receive one and she spent the entire day of the drop trying to get tickets for all of us but was unfortunately unable to do so. We were all upset but understood how difficult it was and how hard she tried. We had given up on getting tickets untill about last week where i happen to get insanely lucky on a resale website and was able to snag 2 tickets. I decided to take my partner because I wanted to share this occasion with his especially since we'd have to be traveling to a different state. When I posted on social media about the tickets and how excited i was my friend messaged me upset calling me an asshole for not taking her. She says that she had been trying super hard to get tickets because it would be her first concert and she's literally the biggest fan i know. She callede an asshole saying that i should be taking her instead because my boyfriend isn't really a fan which is partially true he's really only listened to her since her newest album dropped because of me. She is saying that I'm essentially picking him over her friendship because i knew how important this was to her. She is now not speaking to me because she thinks it's unfair and she feels like im choosing him over her. However i just feel like this is an experience I'd prefer to have with my partner than with my friend. So AITA?\n\nEdit: Editing to include the fact that Mimi was not just trying to buy tickets for herself and I there was 5 people in the group. There is group of 3 of us that have been friends since middle school. My partner and 1 other friend that we met in college who were close with make up the 5. She was the only one trying to get tickets on ticketmaster because she was the only one who got a fan code but it would have been whoever got a code that would have been securing the tickets not specifically her. As someone stated in a comment no matter what happened 3 people would have been left out. Also another clarification for those who haven't been involved in the Taylor swift resale situation. When you're buying resale (i worded it wrong originally it wasn't a website it was a group) you don't get to pick how many tickets you're purchasing. Someone will just say hey I'm selling x amount of tickets to this place on this date and you buy them if you can. Honestly like i said we'd all kind of given up hope we'd get tickets because of how difficult it was so when I saw the two i didn't think twice about purchasing them just because it wasn't 5. Chances of finding 5 together this close to the concert is practically impossible. I do see and understand i probably should have told our friends privately i was just way too excited and didn't think about it. Also my boyfriend is a fan! I wouldn't be dragging him there. He would definitely enjoy himself. He just hasn't really listened to her but when her newest album came out I introduced him to more of her music and we listen to her all he time he just happens to be a newer fan.", "created_utc": 1682063348, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tub34/aita_for_taking_my_bf_to_the_taylor_swift_concert/", "score": 1554, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's unfortunate that you couldn't  get more, but I'm certain that if you could have procured your friend a ticket, you would have. That doesn't make you an AH.

He\u2019s not even a fan.", "YTA Taylor would be ashamed of you", "Honestly, I was going to ask for more details, but I think regardless of the answers to my question that you're NTA. You got the tickets, your friend group wanted to go but you want to go with your BF and you decided to go with him. That doesn't make you an asshole, it makes you a lucky someone that managed to get ahold of 2 tickets instead of 5. Your friend is upset and disappointed, which is understandable, but hopefully this doesn't break your friendship\n\nI have two reasons for this judgement:\n\n1. The argument that Mimi deserves to get the ticket because she was going to get everyone tickets isn't a good argument at all because boils down to \"*Mimi deserves the ticket because she was the one that got the code.\".* It completely ignores the fact that 'being willing to get everyone tickets' is true of yourself, your boyfriend and the other two friends involved in the plans to try and get these tickets. All of you were trying to get the code and all of you were willing to try and secure tickets for everyone else if you did get the code. Just to show how ridiculous that argument is, let me present the following scenario: Mimi and your boyfriend both got a verified fan code, but your boyfriend could only secure 2 tickets with that fan code. If we follow the argument that is being used for why Mimi deserves one of the tickets that you bought, then in this scenario it means that your boyfriend would be expected to give Mimi one of the 2 tickets he got. What happens to the other? There are several options\n   1. He goes to the concert with Mimi. He bought the ticket so he absolutely does deserve to go, but I think everyone here would agree that it's kind of weird to go to a concert that your Bf/GF wants to go to not with them, but with their best friend.\n   2. He gives you the ticket so that you can go with Mimi. It'd be nice for you and Mimi, but disappointing for him since he's the one that bought both tickets and he doesn't even get to go enjoy the concert.\n   3. He gives one of the other two friends the ticket. How is he going to choose? What would be fair, do they just draw straws and whoever gets the longest straw gets the ticket? Cool, Mimi and that friend get to go to the concert....that he paid for. Are they going to pay him back? Would you have been disappointed that your boyfriend didn't give you one of the two tickets since he gave them both away?\n   4. Since Mimi was the only other person to get the verified code, maybe she and your boyfriend are really the only people that get to choose which of you 5 get to go. So if he's not going to go, and he can't choose whether to give you the other ticket or to give it to one of the other two friends, maybe he just gives them both to Mimi and she gets to choose who gets to accompany her to the concert....that your boyfriend paid for.\n   5. Since he can only get 2 tickets and Mimi isn't able to get any for anyone else, he foregoes getting the tickets and no one goes to the concert.\n2. Being a fan of something for less time than someone else doesn't make them any less of a fan nor does it mean they're \"not a true fan\". They're just a **new** fan, and being a new fan or \"less\" of a fan doesn't mean they are any less deserving of a ticket than a massive long-time fan. If your boyfriend wants to go - genuinely wants to go and not \"wants to go because it makes you happy\" - if he would enjoy going, then he deserves to go just as much as Mimi does. And the people saying that he's \"not a real fan\" just because he's new to her music? You're the same as the dipshits that accuse women in game or comic stores of being \"fake fans\" if they don't know the answers to every question they get asked about the game or comic they're trying to buy.\n\nI think what you are an AH for, though, is for letting her find out over social media that you got two tickets and were going with your boyfriend. She probably would've still been upset (and it's fine for her to be upset and disappointed, just like it's fine for you to choose to go with your BF instead of her), but at least she would have found out directly from you rather than getting the whiplash of seeing it on social media.", "NTA fully going against the grain on this one.\n\nMimi tried to get tickets for all 3 of you but had no luck.\n\nYou got lucky and managed to get 2 tickets.\n\nIt's entirely up to you who you take then. Yes Mimi will miss out and that's a shame but that is all. \n\nYour partner may become your husband in the future and no matter what anyone else says, your partner should always take priority over friends because they are the one you will build a life and future with. Love for a partner is different than that of a friend so ofcourse you will choose them first.", "I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t be impressed if mimi got you a ticket and decided to give it to someone else.\n\nI\u2019d be surprised if your friendship hadn\u2019t been ruined over this choice.\n\nYTA.", "YTA lol he\u2019s not gonna propose during that one song you shouldve took your friend.

Just bc he hasn't been a fan for as long as she has doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to enjoy the show with his partner. \n\nAlso, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but your friend needs to accept that she IS second priority to your partner. That's what happens when you grow up. I understand she's a long term friend but we don't build lives with our friends, we do that with our partners. It's not like you've been dating this guy for 2 weeks. She can't expect you to prioritize them equally. I love my friends but not like I love my husband and if push came to shove there's no question who I would choose. \n\nObviously if you had access to 5 tickets and didn't take them you'd be an AH but that isn't what happened.

I actually stepped in and tried to help get the tickets because people looked so distressed. \n\nSo yes, if this was some normal concert with a normal entertainer who toured more often, sure, you wanted to take your bf, I get it, still crappy but I get it. \n\nThis was not a normal situation. The taylor ticket debacle really upset a lot of people. Yta and you can say adios to that friendship.", "yeah, coming in I had one question, and it was \"Does your BF care\" and \"Who will get the most enjoyment out of it\"\n\nOP pretty much answered that, and not in a way that makes him sound like a good person.", "Agreed. \n\nMimi is right. You chose your bf over her.  So hopefully you marry him because I doubt your friendship will last much longer.  10 years, thrown away just so you could have sex with your bf in a different state.  \n\nCongrats, OP.  YTA.", "This.. 100% YTA", "Opie, the old saying goes gals before Pals our sisters before misters anyway. Take your best friend and leave the guy to his own devices it's not like he's a big fan so take your long time and very devoted fan slash friend.", "OP said the boyfriend is a fan in the edit. New fans can be big fans.", "Because Mimi was trying to get tickets for a group of five people, and that group plan no longer exists.\n\nWhen it fell apart, it was up to everyone individually to decide whether they were willing to keep putting in the leg work, or if they just wanted to snap their fingers say \"shucks,\" and move on. \n\nOP found an opportunity for two tickets and he's taking his sweetheart. There's *nothing\ufffc* wrong with that.\n\nIt was one person's back up plan out of a group of five. It is a completely different situation than the initial buying situation.", "Wasn\u2019t she also spending time to do something nice for herself?", "This is perfectly put.\n\nOP, YTA.  Take Mimi to the concert.  Your BF can still come, and go to the cinema/hang out in the hotel, whatever, while you and Mimi see the concert.", "Or just reverse the situation: imagine OP trying hard to score tickets for her best friend and a couple of other friends but can't get them.  Then learning through social media her best friend has 2 found two tickets and is inviting her boyfriend who is not that much into Taylor Swift...  Would OP be upset or would she things that perfectly her friend's right?", "OP just doesn't have a moral compass and I'd be questioning the friendship if I were Mimi", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll so much to find this. This sums it up perfectly! Needs to be higher up.", "This doesn\u2019t make sense? 3 years of dating is a long time and if they are good together ofcorse he comes first (talking in general not about the concert, cause your comment sounds like that).", "It clearly states 23M, as in a guy.", "The edit just made op sound worse aswell. Mimi is right to question the friendship I feel. YTA", "As a swiftie who couldn\u2019t get tickets I would be beyond livid to be OPs friend in this situation holy shit", "This should be top comment", "Because she values her romantic relationship more than her platonic ones obviously regardless of any context", "You\u2019re extremely entitled just like Mimi, you don\u2019t own the music", "OR that they got ripped off. that would be pretty awesome.", "Not true. The boyfriend is a fan of TS but only recently. If you phrase it differently then it's a gatekeeper trying to say the younger fan is less deserving of a concert ticket because they haven't listened to the artist for as long. Which is silly.", "Are you single?", "I'm sure it was considering they did nothing wrong at all and the friend is an entitled crybaby\n\nNTA", "Thank you this is spot on imo. An overall NTA but definitely room for reflection on how they communicated to the friend.", "The only logical sane answer here. It\u2019s obvious OPs BF will enjoy himself just as much as Mimi. Sure Mimi is a super fan. But the original plan was for all the friends to go. If OPs relationship is important to him, which it sounds like it is, then this may be a milestone event. Traveling together, sharing a new and exciting experience like a major concert like that, those are the memories that stay with you for a lifetime. I get Mimi is disappointed, she had a right to be, but as adults sometimes priorities change and sometimes you have to make a decision that may not sit well with long time friends. If he\u2019s willing to live with the consequences of not being in Mimi\u2019s good graces than so be it. He may lose a friend or maybe he won\u2019t. I think what\u2019s will ultimately matter is how he decides to maintain his friendship in the wake of prioritizing his relationship with BF over his best friend.\n\nAlso forgot to add I agree. NTA", "this 1000%", "I agree, but I am not sure why you put emphasis on who bought the tickets. I assume that anyone who got a ticket from someone else would reimburse them; surely Miami wasn't going to treat 4 other people to a crazily expensive concert.", "Yeah I\u2019m kinda shocked at the responses here going straight for YTA. But slightly disagree with you. I think NAH. Friend isn\u2019t an asshole for being upset that they weren\u2019t a first option for a ticket, especially when they are best friends. OP isn\u2019t an asshole for giving the ticket to her boyfriend and boyfriend isn\u2019t an asshole for accepting it.", "To be fair this was also poor planning on Mimi and the groups part. The chances of her getting 5 tickets was insane and very likely impossible. She should have tried to get as many as she possibly could even if it just ended up being one. Then everyone else should try hitting up the resale sites/groups. Nothing is stopping any of them to try the same. If you want tickets to such an in demand event you need to divide your efforts and be ruthless/persistant. I wonder how many friendships have been torn apart by this concert?", "I'm amazed honestly by the responses, I usually fully agree with this sub. But yeah, what about the other 2 that are left out? Not everyone was going to be able to go, the original plan was all 5 of them, that plan is out the window now.", "Agreed! Unless there was some kind of understanding between you and Mimi, I don\u2019t see a problem here.", "Had to scroll way too far to find an actually sane take. Thank you for giving me some faith in this subreddit \ud83d\udc4d", "I somewhat agree. I feel like it\u2019s more of a NAH situation. I really don\u2019t understand how op is the ah in the situation. Has no one read the edits where op says that his boyfriend is also a fan of T Swift he\u2019s just a newer fan, which is just as deserving to go to the concert as someone who has been a life long fan. I\u2019m not a fan of Taylor myself so I can\u2019t fathom going through all this trouble for two tickets just to be told I\u2019m an ah for choosing to take my boyfriend instead of a friend. Op bought the tickets and is choosing to take the person he feels he\u2019d have the most fun taking. He\u2019s not an ah for that. I don\u2019t want to say Mimi is an ah for being upset either. She\u2019s allowed to be upset about her friend choosing his boyfriend over her but at the end of the day it\u2019s his decision who he takes", "NTA same. Your friend is acting entitled to YOUR tickets just because she tried to get you one.", "Here for the downvoted as well.\n\nNTA, OP, for all the reasons listed above. Mimi can't gatekeep other fans, and just because your BF is new to Swift doesn't mean he doesn't have a right to go. It sucks that she can't get a ticket but hey, it's a concert not a life-saving organ donation, and it's not like this is a farewell tour or anything.\n\nI know I sound harsh on Mimi, I understand her feelings and her jealousy, but even then she's not thinking about your other two friends who I am guessing are huge fans as well? But is she mad at everyone else who got tickets but aren't superfans? Life is full of these disappointments, unfortunately, and I have missed out on getting tickets to see fave singers/bands who then never toured again. I get it. But it's a first world problem, and I never resented friends who managed to get tickets even when I was arguably the \"bigger\" fan.\n\nBesides, there is nothing stopping you or your other friends from keeping your eyes peeled for more tickets coming available. I know it's super unlikely but you managed it, so you never know.", "Exactly, being a little upset that you can\u2019t go to the concert is one thing but the entitlement coming from mimi is incredibly inappropriate", "Agreed, NTA. I was surprised I had to scroll this far especially since the original group was 5 people, and OP only managed to snag 2 tickets after the fact. \n\nI would also take my partner of 3 years if I only had 2 tickets. They should be taking priority in this situation. It\u2019s not like they\u2019ve only been dating a few months.", "I suspect many people on here assume OP is a woman and are trying to play the \u201cchicks before dicks\u201d card. \n\nBut you\u2019re spot on. If OP took Mimi and the other friends got pissed, would these folks defend OP? This is just a crappy situation where someone is going to feel left out. Sucks but that\u2019s life.", "Where does this idea that the bf is not a fan come from? Because they're male? So is op", "Oh no a new partner has become the number one in their life because that's how relationships work....\nNta", "There definitely is a lot of super-weird through-the-looking glass groupthink here lately.", "I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone when I'm on here. My opinions are literally *always* the opposite of the group.", "This! OPs bf likes Taylor Swift as well! It was a group of 5 who were meant to be going in the first place - I would've expect the couple in the group to end up going together over the best friends", "LMAO! Tell us how you really feel!", "Seems OP feels comfortable with his decision. Maybe not comfortable with losing the friend. He really pulled a jerk move.", "To get laid at the hotel they stay at after lol pathetic", "I feel like everyone saying this is picturing the boyfriend as a straight man.\n\nAnyway, OP has clarified that boyfriend is a fan. Just a new fan instead of a superfan.", "He says 2.", "That's harsh.OP said the boyfriend is a fan.", "i promise taylor would not care about this at all", "Years from now, if he's not still with the dude, he'll sometimes think \"what a great weekend that was.\"", "Boys", "Op is male..", "The issue is mimi was getting tickets for a group of 5 of them. If OP picked mimi than the other 3 friends will be upset. Picking BF who is also a fan is better than picking one of 4 of his friends and have 3 of them upset at him", "Perfect solution! You get the \u201cgoing away\u201d experience with your boyfriend. Your friend and you can really enjoy the Taylor Swift concert and he can hang back at the hotel or do something he wants to do for the night.\n\nI get why OP chose his boyfriend, but also feel for his friend. This is the perfect compromise.", "Whenever I see someone say \u201cthis is the way\u201d on AITA I imagine Din Djarin sitting at a computer passing judgement on strangers\u2019 behavior.", "Agree. This sucks. And you didn\u2019t even have the decency to tell her directly so she had to find out on social media? YTA. I\u2019d be very hurt if I was her.", "Yeah, except there\u2019s a whole group of friends trying to go, and she only had one ticket. So if she takes one friend instead of the other friends, that also makes her the asshole.", "Three things about this really stand out. \n\nThe first is the fact that Mimi was going for five tickets, which must have meaningfully impacted her chances of going because had she just been doing for one or even two, she'd have had more options. \n\nOP didn't even bother to tell her that he got the tickets before screaming to the internet -- in fact says he didn't think of it. \n\nHe wants to go with his boyfriend because that's the experience he wants to have and the impact this would have on his relationship with his best friend is so secondary to that it feels like he's just someone who is very selfish, is used to being very selfish and doesn't really understand the idea that he should ever do anything other than what he most wants to do, no matter who he hurts. \n\nDefinitely YTA. But I'm not sure the OP will ultimately do anything different.", "Definitely.  OP is TA just for the fact of posting on social media first without giving bf the heads up.   That would probably upset me more than anything, just the idea that you are an after-thought and not even considered would really hurt the friendship.", "Agreed. It\u2019s a hard one for me, but I also think it\u2019s reasonable to want to go with his boyfriend and make a trip of it, sucks for Mimi and she\u2019s justified in being annoyed/disappointed, but often times partners do trumps friends. The AH move was not handling it more delicately.\n\nI also get she put a ton of time and effort into getting 5 tickets, but it\u2019s not like OP put a ton of effort into getting 2 tickets by the sounds of it, he got lucky. Again, sucks and feelings are gonna get hurt, but he could have saved himself from being an AH by considering Mimi\u2019s feelings and clueing her in, even if he wasn\u2019t going to take her.", "Agree with this assessment", "The edit is unreal to me. The refusal to accept judgement.", "how is that HIS fault?", "Mimi was getting tickets for a group of them. If OP took mimi then the other 3 people will also be left out.\n\nIf BF is a fan, taking bf would be the best solution instead of picking one out of 4 friends and have the other 3 mad at you.", "how dare OP choose their life partner over their friend; who can go to any concert for her first time and is MAKING op choose between partner and friend, a real friend wouldn't do that.", "OP is a man.", "Finally I\u2019ve been looking for this", "OP is a man", "I had a work bff. We joked around that she would have an elaborate wedding and I would be one of he bridesmaid.\n\nShe then got knocked up and had a shotgun wedding. Only invited 50 people, most of which were fam. I didn't get invited.\n\nI'm not holding a grudge, I hold no ill will. We're still good friends. That's because I understand that for most people, money is a constraint because weddings cost a lot, and beyond social there's familial obligations. If money wasn't an issue, sure - but we all can't be born with a silver spoon.\n\nAnd yes, I understand and agree what you're saying that it's not an apples-to-apples comparison, but it paints the picture and if it doesn't get the message across - then your's/OP's way of thinking is goner than I originally thought.", "The wedding is just an analogy to an event which is very important to you and your friend, where you make the decision to exclude your friend in favor of someone who will not care or appreciate it nearly as much \u2014 all because it\u2019s your, uh, thing and you have the power. And then insist on still calling yourself smb\u2019s friend after so clearly hurting them.", "I feel like this is different. There is a group of 5 people. Mimi is only one of them.
