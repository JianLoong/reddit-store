I have also been best friends with my friend let's call her Mimi (23f) since we were 13, we have a lot history and are very good friends. Now back when the tickets for Taylor originally dropped we did not get a verified fan code so we weren't able to access the website to purchase tickets. However Mimi did receive one and she spent the entire day of the drop trying to get tickets for all of us but was unfortunately unable to do so. We were all upset but understood how difficult it was and how hard she tried. We had given up on getting tickets untill about last week where i happen to get insanely lucky on a resale website and was able to snag 2 tickets. I decided to take my partner because I wanted to share this occasion with his especially since we'd have to be traveling to a different state. When I posted on social media about the tickets and how excited i was my friend messaged me upset calling me an asshole for not taking her. She says that she had been trying super hard to get tickets because it would be her first concert and she's literally the biggest fan i know. She callede an asshole saying that i should be taking her instead because my boyfriend isn't really a fan which is partially true he's really only listened to her since her newest album dropped because of me. She is saying that I'm essentially picking him over her friendship because i knew how important this was to her. She is now not speaking to me because she thinks it's unfair and she feels like im choosing him over her. However i just feel like this is an experience I'd prefer to have with my partner than with my friend.

That didn't pan out.\n\nYou found 2 tickets so you snapped them up for you and your boyfriend. Simple. It's unfortunate that you couldn't  get more, but I'm certain that if you could have procured your friend a ticket, you would have. That doesn't make you an AH. Your boyfriend has been your significant other for 3 years, long enough for them to be a priority in a situation like this.\n\nThe fact that your friend is getting this upset about going to see a multimillionaire perform for money and throwing a major wrench into your friendship over this is what's crazy. Taylor Swift is young. She's going to have more world tours. This isn't worth potentially ruining such a long term friendship over and I hope your friend realises this and apologises to you.\n\nGo to the concert, enjoy the trip and have a great time.

I'd much rather go to a Nickleback concert than partake in this relationship-ruining madness that is trying to get TS tickets. At least I'd have fun, be able to relax and retain all of my friends", "\"plan a fun night\" i'm \ud83d\udc80", "OP knew his friend was trying to buy ticket for him as well but as soon as he got the ticket he decided to go with his bf rather than his lifelong friend and then posting it on social media instead of talking to her. I am not a swiftie either.", "I agree, NTA and will take all the downvotes with you. Partner of three years is the obvious +1 if you only have two tickets to something, especially when it\u2019s a travel situation. Of course she could have chosen her friend instead, but she\u2019s not doing anything terrible by not doing so. Especially since the boyfriend was always part of the plan here, even back when Mimi was originally trying to get tickets.", "She meant Mimi was the only one who got a \u201cfan code,\u201d which I guess means access to the section where you try to buy tickets.", "He*", "I think you misunderstood. Mimi was looking to buy a number of tickets for a group. Unable to. \nOP spotted two ( only 2)on a resale site. No choice to get more.", "Limitless lololololol clearly you\u2019ve never gotten married", "Haha no.\n\nWedding invitations have limits, too. That's another head to feed, another person to sit, which could end making you choose another venue because \"sorry, you exceeded our limit by one(1) person.\"", "I\u2019m also not giving a judgement, just pointing out its \u2018he\u2019 not \u2018she\u2019.", "This cements it as NAH for me. Your bf was always part of the plan. While I get Mimi's frustration, you only managed to get 2 tickets. It sucks but there were inevitably gonna be 3 people from the original group who wouldn't get to come with.", "Agree!\n(I would always prefer nickelback over TS tho. I don't like her music very much. xD)", "Okay\u2026 I admit I made an error in how I wrote this\u2026 \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02", "Oh. Thanks. \n\nIn that case YTA, OP", "The fact that the boyfriend isn\u2019t a major fan also matters along with the whole posting it on social media. She should have told the friend so much so that if the boyfriend had got the tickets instead of her she still should have told the friend so she didn\u2019t have to get an immediate feeling of being left out when she saw it on social media.", "Same lmao", "How so? Why does being a fan suddenly entitle Mimi to go to the concert more than the bf? I'm assuming the 2 other friends are also fans but I didn't see anything about them getting mad at OP so I don't understand the \"being left out\" part either.", "\"why does it entitle someone who is the biggest fan of someone to go to the concert more than someone who isnt really a fan and only listened to the newest album\"  ...is is really THAT hard for you to get that? Like seriously? Espeically When your best friend of 10 years does that? Wow", "Marsi e you literally are not understanding the dynamics of the situation his bff was his bff since they were little kids and she values this friendship to a very high tier and thought op felt the same and that he would understand that only true swifty would choose a fellow swifty. Nope he is thinking selfishly.. he can do whatever he wants but it doesn\u2019t make it right. I wonder what Taylor Swift would say herself\u2026.", "It amazes me how many people don't understand their own sense of entitlement. I agree with you.", "It\u2019s not like it\u2019s his boyfriend of a month though- they\u2019ve been together for three years. Even though Mimi has been his friend for 7 years longer it\u2019s not like OP is taking some fling to the concert instead of his buddy. These guys are in a long term relationship and I think it\u2019s cool that they are getting to go on a road trip together to see this concert. \nI may be a bit biased just because I LOVE going on road trips with my wife, but she\u2019s also my best friend.\n\nIt sucks that they weren\u2019t all able to get tickets and go together like originally planned, but sometimes stuff just doesn\u2019t work out, maybe next time. I\u2019m gonna say NAH here.\n\nAlso I never understood gatekeeping a fandom; like I\u2019ve been a fan longer than you so I am obviously a bigger fan and you don\u2019t understand the music like me cause I\u2019ve been around since the beginning/discovered them first. I remember kids in my middle school and up into early high school acting like this, and it doesn\u2019t seem like much has changed in 20 years."]}
