{"id": 34621, "submission_id": "191tysp", "title": "AITA for telling my husband that I will no longer participate in family vacations if his ex is present?", "selftext": "Here's the background:\n\nWhile on a study abroad, my husband \"Robert\" got his foreign girlfriend \"Elizabeth\" pregnant. Their relationship was rocky and they've been broken up since Tim was about 1. I met Robert when their son \"Tim\" was 3 years old, Robert and I have now been together 13 years.\n\nWhen I met Robert he was upfront that Tim always comes first and unfortunately is a package deal with Elizabeth until Tim is old enough for solo international travel - this was 'unfortunate' because at that time Robert and Elizabeth hated each other. My parents-in-law have always paid for plane tickets for Elizabeth and Tim to visit. Elizabeth and Tim usually visit for 2-3 weeks every year. Robert always requested my presence for these visits, to build a relationship with Tim and (at least the first few years)  for moral support dealing with Elizabeth.\n\nElizabeth has (mostly) been nice to me although it's very superficial - we are not friends. She's fine with the in-laws, because they're very nice people who just want a relationship with their grandson and would never jeopardize that access. Robert and Elizabeth's relationship gradually improved, and by the time Tim was 7 they were on friendly terms.\n\nBeing required to spend 2-3 weeks every year staying in the same house as my husband's ex has always been at minimum uncomfortable for me, at times extremely difficult and painful. But I tolerated it without complaint, without fully expressing how hard it was, because I felt that my main 'job' here is to support Robert. I've been holding out for the goalpost Robert identified early on, that when Tim is old enough to travel alone, presumably Elizabeth will no longer come with.\n\nWell, that time has arrived. Tim is 16, traveled alone to visit last summer and it was awesome. However Elizabeth said she wants to come visit again this year, and continue doing so every other year (no end date stated). My parents-in-law will never stop paying for plane tickets and never suggest Elizabeth not come - in fact 2 years ago, prior to Tim's first solo trip, they assured Elizabeth that she is ALWAYS welcome even after Tim is an adult, that she is family too. Statements/events like that have amounted to 'death by a thousand cuts' in which I've been experiencing serious depression surrounding Elizabeth's visits. I feel like that goalpost I was holding out for...has vanished entirely.\n\nSo I told Robert that I will no longer be present for the full 'family' vacations when Elizabeth comes, I will hang out for one or two weekends only (he knows I'm fully on board with vacations that do not include Elizabeth though). He is hurt, says my lack of presence shows everyone (including Tim) that I don't care. I say that a step-mother cannot form a relationship with a step-child *when the mother is present* anyway, and these visits are causing me extreme emotional distress so it's time I take care of myself (because no one else is considering my emotions here).

With your in laws? I just want to make sure I understand correctly. Instead of having your stepson come to visit and stay with you and your husband in your home - your in laws hijack the trip (by paying) which then forces you and husband to go stay at his parents house for 2-3 weeks in order to see his kid? \n\nDoes your husband have any legal custody and does he pay child support? I feel like the child should be coming to visit and stay with you in your home at this point. But husband should be paying and arranging. Why are the grandparents doing this? This is a messed up custody situation and it sounds like it is due to your husband relinquishing his parental control to his parents. Sounds like he is the AH.", "NTA...He laid out the boundaries on this at the very beginning and you abided by it. Everyone has a limit and if you've reached yours, then you've reached it.

You have been tolerant and supportive for a very long time, and it perfectly reasonable that you have reached then end of your patience.\n\nIt sounds like your husband doesn't want to acknowledge the strain these visits put on you, and is trying to guilt you back into quiet compliance. He wants you to make his life easier. It is ok for you to say you have had enough of Elizabeth. You are not obliged to be his meat shield against her.", "Nta. Sounds exhausting watching your husband play family with the ex.  Im sure you get treated like an aunt or something but it would not be enough for me. I'm amazed you did it so long, honestly. What's the point of having a relationship if he only comes once a year with his mother's anyways", "INFO: Does she disrespect you or treat you badly in any way? Does she ignore your presence or hit on your husband? Is she unpleasant to you or it just her presence that bothers you?", "NTA.

Your husband needs to have a conversation with his parents about not including his ex in everything.", "NTA - I get it. You\u2019re done", "NTA. And dont listen to the 14 year olds saying otherwise. Its beyond weird that this woman has come to stay *in your home* for weeks at a time for years. Theyre saying shes family. Shes literally not?? Shes the mother of their grandchild. You are their sons wife. YOU are family. Find me a woman who has no problems with their husbands ex living in THEIR home and Ill show you a liar. Youve been beyond accomodating for over a decade. Your in laws are being so insensitive. Choose yourself on this one", "NTA, don't go. He says this means you don't care? You've been doing this for years! You have a limit and that's fine. There's no reason she needs to be included with her son now. Your husband should stand up for you.

Now it is time he followed yours.  \nI don't understand why the mom needs to come to these family vacations. She can visit the grandparents seperately.  \nYour husband needs to step up and tell them they're welcome to house her, but he has his own family and while she will always be the mother of his child, she is not his immediate family and now it is time to take care of that family.  \nits honestly a dissapointment that he let you down like this after you supported him for all thos years.  \n\n\nmaybe show him your post and all the commenters?", "NTA\n\nShe will always be in the family, because of her son. Knowing this must be difficult for you, since you have not a child with your husband. You were watching them (your in-laws, your husband, his ex, their child) all those years.

Do the grandparents host Tim & Elizabeth and if so, why? Why doesn't Tim come alone and visit his dad at March break, for example? I assume the Grands would pay for that if R can't, since they have no prob paying for E's summers as long as she wants to come. If it's a summer family reunion type thing you all attend, are there many more people present and are there multiple outings to choose from where E can go one way and you can go another? Or is it literally just the Grands, Tim, his parents and you? THAT would be pretty uncomfortable as it would appear on the surface at least that your in-laws are literally choosing E's wishes and comforts over yours, while their son choose you as his life-partner, not her . . . Especially now that Tim is a young adult who couldn't be kept away from his father & grands if he wanted to see them! If Tim's entire yearly time with his dad is and has always been that summer get-together, you couldn't have had any opportunity to develop a relationship with Tim outside of being \"dad's wife\". If Robert's original reason for forcing you to spend several weeks each year with his x was to support him during their ill will, why are you expected to be there now, since their relationship improved 7yrs ago? If you have no relationship with Tim and your presence would not be missed by him, it seems like the whole thing is just an exercise in making you uncomfortable for zero reason. If this is all accurate, NTA, dropping by on a wknd sounds like enough involvement as it seems unlikely you'd be missed by anyone except perhaps your husband.", "NTA. \nYou've put in the hard yards and every year you've had to use your leave to support your husband to see his child and his ex. \nIt sounds like when he and his family made every effort to support this no one acknowledged how difficult this was for you. And no one made an effort to include you fully or demonstrate that you and your husband are a package too. \n\nLike you said, you have no problem with Tim but Elizabeth's presence changes the dynamic. \n\nAs someone who has struggled with infertility myself I empathise with you in this situation as well. \n\nI think you and your husband need to engage in therapy. I don't think you're being selfish. And if I were you I'd probably take myself to a resort for one of the weeks that Tim and Elizabeth are there. \n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  Of course you want to spend your hard earned PTO with your husband, or your husband and stepson, but there is no reason to hang out with with hubbies ex.  Stepson is 16, he doesn't need his mom by his side every moment.  Stepson can be invited to supper or outings without his mom at this point.  Ex can hang with ex in laws or friends.  Everyone does not need to be tied at the hip.  What a ridiculous set up.  Ex has been unfair and controlling, constantly threatening no contact with the kid if she doesn't get everything her way.  Of course you don't want to hang out with such a person!  Gross.", "NTA. You offer a very decent compromise of spending some time on the weekend. Frankly I don't think many people would be happy to spend 3 weeks at a time with their inlaws alone, nevermind the inclusion of the child's mother. \n\nI can understand a NAH or even ESH vote from this group, but I don't see the YTA judgement, even if your negative feelings about your own fertility might be misplaced on this situation.", "Yes taking care of yourself is the way to go here and I\u2019m proud of you for doing it!

Of course you feel slighted and uncomfortable, OP- because you\u2019ve been fed tiny bites of hope of this ending for years only for it to blow up in your face now and be painted as a bad person for calling it out. Fuck that! \n\nStep Mom\u2019s get the the shitty end of every stick, at this point I would leave. Not because your husband has a child with someone else, or because your in-laws are comfortable maintaining a relationship with their grandchild\u2019s Mother (totally reasonable) but because you\u2019ve been dragged along, degraded and fed a false promise by your selfish, self-serving coward husband for over a decade. He doesn\u2019t value you or harmony in the life you\u2019re supposed to share together", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a horrible way to spend every vacation.", "NTA.  \n\n\nMaybe next time Elizabeth comes, she could stay with the in-laws and Tim could stay with you?", "Nta but the kid being old enough means she should stay with the inlaws. Not with yall. Also she should be spending time with inlaws and let yall have time with the kid. Without her. This is your family time. Isn't there a custody in place by now???", "NTA. The kid is no longer a child and he\u2019s already traveled internationally alone to visit. If the in laws want to pay for the ex to also come they should accommodate her at their home. She should never have stayed in your home. Your husband and in-laws should be more supportive of you. I feel like they are unconsciously punishing you. Do you have kids with him or is this kid their only grandkid? \n\nFor anyone calling you TA for your emotional mental health, they are the biggest AH. Your emotions and feelings should be taken into consideration. No one wants to deal with the ex, regardless if they have been nice, courteous or mean and nasty. \n\nHope you and your husband can come into a healthy agreement regarding the ex visiting.", "Your emotions are valid.

Your husband and in laws are really not very sensitive to the position you are in. It\u2019s very awkward.\nIf everything is otherwise good in your marriage, I would be inclined to ride it out. At 16 he\u2019s not going to want to travel with Mommy for much longer, and visiting grandparents won\u2019t be the vacation he wants to take. I would suggest this to hubs, and plan something that the 3 of you could do together that\u2019s exciting or different.

She can go do her own freaking thing, she doesn't need to see her son while he is visiting you guys. End of story. He is with his father.

But it's also reasonable for the ex to come along on the annual extended family vacation and spend time with her son. \n\nUltimately, I think the solution here is to arrange more time with Tim, not try to ban her from the trip. Also, if being around a random, reasonably polite lady causes you \"extreme emotional distress\" and is \"extremely painful\" just because she dated your husband 16 years ago, I think it might be time for some therapy. You seem to be a little more triggered by the ex than is sensible for the type of family dynamic you're describing, and getting help processing those feelings could be useful.", "If Tim is 16, I think you should grin and bear it.

Is it more important to be there physically, or spend intentional time together?\n\nSeems like the issue here is husband and his family genuinely see her as family. *Unfortunately we cannot define others relationship, but you absolutely don\u2019t have to spend your time.*", "Oh this is an awful situation. NTA at all. You were told there was an endpoint and now everyone is going back on it because it's easier for them. Your husband is the biggest a h because he is putting his ex's needs before yours! Tim is fine going alone I presume. In fact he may even prefer it, someone should ask him. But the main point is that your comfort level in your own home with your husband is at negative point and has been for 13 years!!! You are his wife and that means something. You need to tell him again how u feel and tell him that his disregard and disrespect towards your feelings is not acceptable and it will lead to you staying somewhere else for longer than just the weeks the ex is there! It is YOUR home. Don't let some woman he knocked up take it over whenever she comes over. Even show him the comments if he really doesn't believe you're right.\n\nAlso I'm curious if your husband's parents ever said that you are also part of the family always? Do you have a good relationship? Do they outright choose the ex over you? If so this is an even worse situation than u mentioned because your husband isn't putting his foot down for you. He sounds like a bad husband and father because he cares only for everyone else's feelings and not yours, especially painting u as the bad guy when u finally give yourself a respectable distance from a situation that is harming you. If he really felt awful spending time with the ex alone, he should tell her she's no longer allowed to stay with u or come at all. He should be paying for his son's ticket so he has control over the situation. I'm sorry you're going thru this and I wish you the best of luck. But please, if he doesn't respect your comfortability to the whole situation, just leave. It doesn't have to be forever, but just a break away from his selfishness so you can think clearly without him hovering over you.

The end is nigh, but the goalposts have now moved. NTA,   but you do have to decide what you want your relationship with Tim to be like. I might sound like an asshole here, but if your husband has only seen him for 2-3 weeks per year, he's barely a father figure to this kid. It's not like you signed up to be a weekends-only or every-other-week step parent. You were barely given the chance to bond with the kid, since dad/grandparents/ex took priority when he came around.

Good idea to take some of that PTO and spend it on yourself.

Ex has no business at your house.", "I think Elizabeth is taking advantage of the in-laws for a free trip. This was a weird arrangement even when he was young. Now that he\u2019s older it\u2019s a bit absurd.\nUnfortunately, this comes down to OP\u2019s husband not wanting to rock the boat. If he\u2019s not willing to discuss with his parents, so they stop inviting Elizabeth, then she will continue to come. I suspect he\u2019s also worried that he won\u2019t see his son at all if he makes a fuss.\n\nOP I don\u2019t think you should give up now, you only have two year\u2019s until he\u2019s an adult and at that point you and husband can be blunter about arrangements because the son will be in control of things himself. This is really only a couple more visits, so tough it out for a bit longer!", "Can\u2019t your husband just offer the son to come alone next year for a longer time and you guys will buy the ticket and host? Depending on what country he\u2019s from he should be of age where he doesn\u2019t need his mom\u2019s permission? Just tell grandparents you\u2019re offering to host Tim now that he\u2019s older and you guys can cover his bill. If he doesn\u2019t need mom\u2019s permission it really won\u2019t be up to her. Maybe hubby should feel it out with Tim see if he\u2019ll go for that.\n\nNAH. Some people said he\u2019s at the age where he doesn\u2019t need a relationship with you so why bother suffering through the visits.

Especially when you were told this would be the end of that being necessary. Your husband is also an adult and shouldn\u2019t need to use you as a meat shield against his ex. I know she\u2019s held all the cards with custody so far but that doesn\u2019t mean your husband not defending you or standing up for doesn\u2019t suck! He\u2019s nearly an adult too so if you guys can afford to pay for his tickets to come and visit maybe you can just go for long weekends while he\u2019s here if his mums coming and after that suggest yo your husband that he can offer and buy Tim tickets for holidays in the future. If grandparents still want to host both of them that\u2019s their buisness but you guys could host him for a week or two at a different point in the year at your house", "Oof.  This is difficult and what I say is coming from my own situation- sons dad cheated with my high school bully, married her and has two kids with her.  They ended up working at same place.  I left when son was 2 1/2.  He is now 13.  It has taken a long time to get to where we are now, but we buy birthday, Mother\u2019s Day, Christmas gifts for her and birthday presents for her children as they are my sons siblings.  I wish I could spend holidays together with everyone for my son, at least once so he has that memory. I fully intend on inviting his dad, wife and all grandparents together for prom send off someday. Everyone is different and it can be hard on both sides of parents.  But-\n\nThis is about Tim. Tim seeing all the adults who love him in life coming together for him WILL make a huge positive impact in his life.  You also are lucky someone else can foot the bill to fly him in. Even with the ex, Tim gets to remain close to his dads (your husbands) family.  You have been incredible and patient.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s only 2 more years and Tim is then an adult.  An adult is capable of sustaining his own relationship with dad and family on his own.  Maybe a good compromise is that Tim comes alone once he is 18. ??  I know 2 years seems like a lot, but by not changing everything up now- you will have been supportive of Tim and all his relationships and your husband until Tim is a legal adult (in US) and can then learn to make his own decisions and nurture his own relationships. You will have been a crucial part of love and support and helping Tim reach adulthood.  Once he\u2019s -18, his mom can work out her own arrangements with dads family\u2019s. You do NOT have to have her in your home.  \n\nThis is just my input and as a mom of a son who has a stepmom- thank you for what you\u2019ve done for Tim by being supportive.  You didn\u2019t have to be.  I hate you are suffering from this and definitely talk to your husband or someone professional.  Your feelings matter too.  I just want you to know that the sacrifices you\u2019ve already made are not in vain and what you\u2019ve done- matters.  \n\nThere are never too many people that can love a child.

After we divorced they kept inviting her until I sat them down and told them that their relationship was their own and no longer included me. I would walk out if she was ever in the same house. It ended then. Understand weird ways with a child involved but the has passed and a firm conversation needs to be had", "NTA. Staying in the same house for weeks makes absolutely no sense.

But you\u2019ve been with this man for more than a decade; you\u2019re not just some accessory.\n\nIt\u2019s my impression that your husband got your support over all this time by promising you something he was never empowered to deliver, and/or changed his mind about.

How in the hell do you build a relationship with the child because either parents' answer of you get no one on one time to bond. \nI mean, who in the hell no matter how good the relationship is wants the person she slept with staying in their home. Watching memory lane over and over. The conversations you can never be a part of because with them there, you have no bond or stories you can share. In other words, in your own home, you are the outcast. The interloper because you have no bond or relationship with the mother or child. And you have to sit there every year and watch while you are left out and not say anything because 'gasp' you are told you are a jealous AH like many are here. That you have no right to your feelings or emotions.\nWho wants to watch the only time your spouses child is there with extended family hears parents just invite her always as she is family. It would be one thing if she stayed just with them, but the FAMILY expects OP to keep putting her up at her house. By doing and saying these things which they can but placing such pressure on OP and showing who they think and care about. \n\n\nI am sorry, but the agreement was when he was old enough, and now people want to just throw it out the window.

You gave your word and now back out from it. So no, not only will I only go for a weekend while your child is welcome here. YOUR EX is not. She can stay with your parents or a hotel. After 13 years, I have a right to have my house back. To be comfortable in my own space. To not be the outcast in my home. I care, but as there is no relationship as you and her and your parents have made sure of then I see no point in trying anymore. You did nothing to make sure we could bond and exclude me on numerous occasions. She is your ex, but the way you act when she is here clearly shows you don't give a damn what I think or feel. So maybe I won't even go at all. It's not like I would be missed as the family your parents want will clearly be there, and me the afterthought won't be a wrench in things. \n\n\nI am not being petty but have seen the good and bad. The fact that even your spouse never put his foot down and did outtings with just you 3. He never tried to facilitate the bond forming, and I would be willing to walk away.

Everyone has a good relationship or is at least friendly, and I\u2019m sorry but your line about not being able to form a stepmother relationship with the mother present is total bunk.

I get that it hurts that you can't have a child and that really sucks. But to permanently say you will never want to vacation as a group again is a mistake and self-sabotaging. You said in a comment it feels like an f'd up kind of family, but it's just not your average family, but there are lots of unusual and nonstandard families out there.

I'm trying to understand your pov truly but its difficult.  By your own admission they only spend about a week with you, total once a year.  Once a year, how would you cope if they lived in the same country, if they had to coparent every day?  Its been thirteen years and you can't let go of some mean stuff she said in the beginning?  She seems perfectly pleasant now, does not flirt with your husband, does not cause any trouble when you are spending time together.  You don't have to like her or be friends with her.  I do find it hard to believe that you have not found any common ground in 13 years and that leads me to believe the problem is you.\n\nShe will always be around, if there is a child involved she will always be his mother.

You describe this relationship and your husband\u2019s foreign girlfriend from at least 15 years ago since Tim is 16 now and was 1 when they split. She lives in another country, it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re describing a situation where the ex is local and still has designs on your man. If her and Robert can be friendly then honestly there shouldn\u2019t be any reason why you can\u2019t be friendly with her too. It\u2019s not about you or the fact that you dislike that his ex is around, it\u2019s about Tim and what\u2019s best for him. What\u2019s best for him is two parents and step parent(s) with a friendly, cordial relationship that can handle being around each other for a grand total of 2-3 weeks out of the year. I truly do not understand what about this situation could be \u201cpainful\u201d for you as you describe, other than your own ego/insecurities regarding the fact that your husband dated before he met you. That\u2019s something you have to square away, and hopefully you\u2019re mature enough to do that without creating drama in a seemingly peaceful and functioning co-parenting dynamic. I say this as someone who has spent the last 15 years WISHING some of the people I love could have a dynamic as easy going as the one you\u2019ve described here. Your husband and Tim have hit the jackpot in terms of having an ex and co-parent and everyone being on good terms. Don\u2019t be the thing that ruins that. That\u2019d be extraordinarily selfish to do. It doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s 16 and can in one sense travel internationally alone now. His mother has him the other 49 weeks of the year and if she\u2019s not comfortable with him traveling alone internationally then she\u2019s not comfortable and that\u2019s a valid decision for her to make.

Of course you can. He sees you literally as often as he sees his father. Just because you can\u2019t be an active parent doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t build a relationship with him. You can get him presents, play games with him, do fun things with him, etc. The fact that his mother is there does literally nothing to stop you from doing any of that. You just have to actually make an effort. And besides that, if you\u2019re bothered by the lack of relationship now, what the hell do you think is gonna happen when you stop showing up entirely? You think THAT\u2019S the answer here?? Then you\u2019re gonna be mad all over again when ten years down the line you\u2019re not invited to this kid\u2019s wedding or don\u2019t get included when he graduates college or has his first baby, because he\u2019ll have no idea who you are other than some ephemeral idea of his father\u2019s wife who couldn\u2019t be bothered to make an effort to spend time with him/treat him like he was a part of her family too. I\u2019m telling you very sincerely, you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot right now and this is the wrong choice. Keep showing up. Don\u2019t make this your hill to die on.

Death of thousand cuts is a bit melodramatic. You don\u2019t like it which is totally fine. But why do you hate it so much? You are the one inflicting the pain on yourself.

You blame Elizabeth for not being able to get close to her son but you also say you feel like you\u2019re the least important person there since either your hubby or his parents see Tim for a whole year except for these a few weeks. Does Elizabeth exclude you? Does she try to push you away from her son or is she just existing and you feel like you can\u2019t get close? But hey, you already said you don\u2019t feel like getting close to Tim because you don\u2019t want to interrupt his time with his dad and grandparents. \n\nYou also say your in laws said she is always welcomed and if she\u2019s comfortable with them why wouldn\u2019t she take that offer? For your own comfort? I don\u2019t think she cares about you or your husband. I think you overthink about Elizabeth\u2019s existence.\n\nAs for your relationship with Tim. You probably wanted to have more of a motherly or auntie kinda role with him but you\u2019re nothing but his dad\u2019s wife now. Considering your fertility issues I can see you\u2019re a bit more hurt than a normal person would be but Tim does not owe you that kind of a relationship. Don\u2019t you think if he wanted to get to know you better he would act like that? Last time he came his mom wasn\u2019t there so you felt more comfortable about spending time with him and made some real effort. Tim didn\u2019t come to you, at least that\u2019s how it sounds like. Maybe Tim thinks you don\u2019t really care about him because you didn\u2019t really tried to get to know him. You just coexist for many years. So that\u2019s not on Elizabeth either.\n\nNone of this is her fault. It really sounds like Elizabeth just coexist with you and you hated that. But that\u2019s their coparenting relationship with your husband and in laws which who told her she was always welcomed there. They even pay for her to come so don\u2019t you think your in laws and Elizabeth has a sincere relationship? I do. \n\nYou also said she disrespected you once but you were vague about it. Never said what she actually said as far as I read. So I\u2019ll take that with a grain of salt. \n\nOh, and one more thing. Your jealousy about Tim walking hand to hand with his parents. You knew he had a kid from another woman when you got into this relationship. You knew they would share this connection for their whole life. Now you can\u2019t be like \u201cI don\u2019t like to see them together\u201d. They\u2019re gonna come together for their kid, probably even more in the future. Your insecurities are not more important than his son who only sees his dad a few weeks in a year. Learn to deal with it.\n\nIf you don\u2019t go it will give a clear message, you don\u2019t mind not seeing Tim. Which will only make things awkward when they see you but hey, it sounds like you plan to see him for a few days so it shouldn\u2019t be that bad.\n\nEven after everything I think you\u2019re not the asshole, you\u2019re just insecure in a relationship where your partner has a kid with someone else.

Which is another point on the other side of the argument: my husband gets so little time with his son, and this visit is the only time my parents-in-law get with their grandson, so I feel like I'm literally the least important person there - that it's much more important for the father and grandparents to maximize their time with Tim.

My husband would not be able to afford paying for both Elizabeth and Tim to visit (at this point however we could buy Tim's ticket which I would be fine with).\n\nThere's no possibility for legal custody given the two different countries.

She's not horrible, but she is emotional that's all cause of the situation", "But she\u2019s not family!!! Only the child is family. She is just an ex. Not even an ex-wife; just an ex-girlfriend.", "Hm. Maybe I didn't explain the emotional side of it well enough. The main reason I'd like to opt out is because participating IS causing me serious emotional distress, whereas opting out SAVES ME FROM THAT. Hanging out with my husband, his ex, and their son (the four of us together like some f'ed up version of a family), hearing them bond over  what the son was like as a baby, discuss where he got certain traits from...when my husband and I were at the end of unsuccessful fertility treatments and I knew we would never have our own child and never have that bond...feels like a particular kind of cruelty to me. That particular event on that trip almost broke me.", "because she if you look at her past posts has been doing IVF. She is depressed and feels emotionally because I think seeing her husband, with his ex and his son makes her feel like that is what she should have had by now.  I think it's easy to understand how she feels. But, at the same time she should have thought 14 years earlier that the ex would always be in his life and that the kid/his mom would always be a packaged deal. Cause let me tell you.... my mom would never send me to another country alone in this situation ever. I wasn't allowed to travel on a plane by myself until I was 18 hahahaha. SO like, people are saying \"this mom wants a free trip\"... which could be true. But, a 14 year old is still a kid. And, some parents could be more protective and it's her only kid.", "Idk. 2-3 weeks straight with your in-laws every year is a lot, and when you throw your partner's ex in there, I can understand why it's tiring. Especially since the kid is a teenager now and traveling without his Mom shouldn't be a big deal.\n\nUltimately OP doesn't get to decide who goes on the trip, but it's understandable that this is an exhausting way to spend 3 weeks of PTO every year for the rest of her life.", ">You\u2019re alienating yourself from the family.\n\nThe family is doing a good enough job of that all on their own.", "The father and step mom are having the right to an individual relationship away from Tim\u2019s mother too.", "The deal has changed. And she's not asking him to choose anything, she's saying she doesn't want to go the years that the ex will be there. \n\nDid you read the whole thing?", "How did she make him choose between her and the son if she said she wanted to only go 2-3 days of the vacation instead of 2 weeks.", "Yeah...but I can't. As I explained in other comments. I've tried talking to him about things but his mother talks over him/answers questions for him when she feels he's not describing things well enough or taking too long. Plus, his grandparents and my SIL (and sometimes even extended in-law family) are there, trying to maximize the little bit of time *they* get with Tim. Even when it's fewer people, it ends up being essentially Tim alone out with his father (which is totally understandable!) and the rest of us just hanging out.", "Why does your husband not have his son visit more? Are there financial constraints?", ">I feel like I'm literally the least important person there - that it's much more important for the father and grandparents to maximize their time with Tim.\n\nThat seems really demoralizing! And no wonder you want to step back. It is true that your husband and his parents are always going to prioritize Tim during the very limited time they have.\n\nYou are entirely right to center your own well-being rather than be put in a situation where even your partner is not going to care about your well-being because his focus is elsewhere.\n\nI think your husband is being a tiny bit of an asshole because he feels some guilt over how his complicated coparenting situation affects you, and it's easier to redirect that guilt than to own it. NTA.", "What you're planning to do is completely understandable. Your feelings matter! Don't let your husband guilt you. Do something nice by yourself when they are visiting and only participate when Elizabeth is not around.", "Is it feasible to add a third trip for the three of you? I think your feelings are valid, but I can see how your husband is hurt you would go an entire year without seeing Tim. I think adding an additional trip for the three of you would be a good solution if you can swing it. The root of the problem is the time Tim is so scarce.", "I don\u2019t think you are the AH, but I do think you are making this about you when I don\u2019t think it really is. I get that you feel like your needs are last on the list with tim, the ex, the husband, the grandparents but you kind of are. If Tim feels happy having his mother along and she feels like she needs to be there and your husband and the grandparents want her there then you just kinda have to deal with it. You don\u2019t have to like it, but it\u2019s part of being a step parent I am afraid. Or a parent in general, your needs don\u2019t come first a lot of the time. It also sounds like you could use someone professional to talk to about the fertility stuff. That does a number on anyone trust me! It sounds like you are making this issue about you and your issues when it doesn\u2019t need to be. Do the work to get your thoughts back on track and get yourself happy and this won\u2019t bother you so much. I also get you want the quality time though. Maybe suggest a compromise where Tim stays for three to four weeks and his mother joins for one?", "Your husband goes to spend time with his son and his ex?  Alone?", "He goes and stays with HER without you?", "Would your husband be willing to pay for a ticket for just Tim? If so, then plan his next trip (without Elizabeth) in advance, and have your husband tell his parents that you two are hosting Tim this time. If they are truly kind and generous people then they will accept that their son wants to be in charge of his relationship with his son now. If they are secretly people who like to be in control and/or trying to get their son and ex back together the they will show their true colors. \n\nIf your ILs insist on hosting a 2nd visit for Tim then let them do that - but that\u2019s *their* vacation and you don\u2019t need to be a part of it. And Elizabeth can stay with them. Stop hosting her in your house.", "Now that Tim is old enough to travel on his own, why can't Elizabeth fly back to her home country after the visit with the in-laws, while Tim comes to visit his father and you? He is plenty old enough to do the flight back by himself.", "Wait. You've been forced to host this woman in your home for over a decade? I can't even. You are a saint.", "Oh hell no would I be comfortable with hosting the ex, let alone staying in the same house as her for a few weeks. You've done well putting up with it so far. \n\nMost people don't understand the very fine line it requires to be a step parent, and a lot of reddit sees step parents as evil.   There seems to be the thought that because you don't want to be around the ex that you're insecure. It's obvious you're not. I'd like to see those suggesting you are, live in the same house as their spouse / partner's ex for 3 weeks.\n\nMaybe the solution is that you wait until your step son is an adult, and then start paying for his flight only. While he's under-age, the ex can withhold access by refusing to let him attend if she does not go, and no one wants that. But I do think you need to discuss this further.", "Wait, so your husband never had Tim alonefor an extended period? That's just bizarre in any context.", "At this point all that is just an excuse. A16 year old is more than capable of traveling by himself, Elizabeth does not need to come at all. Your husband is prioritizing her over you, it's so disrespectful.", "It\u2019s weird af that your husband\u2019s ex stays in your home. Hell fucking no to that. You\u2019ve been incredibly accommodating.", "INFO: what country is the ex in? Is he listed as Tim\u2019s father on a birth certificate? I\u2019m just surprised a country has 0 ways to deal with custody issues when I see another comment says you and your partner are in the US.\n\nETA this is a lot to tolerate while married. I don\u2019t know that I personally could for over a decade.", "Yeah now that he is 16 this is definitely crossing a boundary. You are actually already very lenient with the whole situation which a lot of wives wouldn't have been. I mean I get she has to travel with him but she could have stayed at a hotel and had her own vacation while Tim bonds with the family he never gets to see. It's time for your husband to put you first. Not before Tim but before Elizabeth. Let her stay with the grandparents and Tim can stay with you guys. It's kinda ridiculous that she needs to be apart of the whole family dynamic especially now that he has a new wife. You should really express to your husband that it should end now and that you understood these past 13 years but now that Tim is old enough you want it to change. Don't minimize how deeply this affects you or that I'm assuming you feel like everyone is putting Elizabeth before you during this time. Because that's what I'm getting and it's not okay. Let her stay with grandparents and you 3 build your own family dynamic at your own home.", "Do you and your husband have any of your own children or plans to have them?", "There is no way in hell that I would allow my husbands ex to stay in my house!

Your husband is wrong. This doesn\u2019t show that you don\u2019t care, it shows he has no respect for you by allowing/encouraging his ex to show up for over a decade. Super gross.", "So, after they both get safely to your parents, SHE has always come to your place WITH his son for 16 years?!?!?\n\nNTA - you have been MORE than accommodating.  If the in-laws consider her family, she should spend time with them and give you and your husband time alone with Tim.\n\nIt would be nice if the in-laws would step back let your husband pay to have his son visit.\n\nI cannot imagine how stressful this has been for you and you have been putting up with it for 16 years.", "Having Elizabeth stay with your in laws for the visit while your son stays with you maybe an ok compromise. She\u2019ll still be close by should he need her but this will allow your wife to feel comfortable in her own home and bond with her step son. Also, since you are his father, it\u2019s not like you need supervision to spend time with your kid. You can all meet up to do stuff together so everyone gets to see everyone.", "Yeah, she doesn't need to come to your home at all. \n\nIf they're going to keep inviting her there's nothing you can do about that, but there is absolutely no reason for her to stay in your home when Tim visits.  It's very controlling.\n\nOn the one hand, it's flattering that everyone has done such a good job making Elizabeth feel welcome, and I can fully understand why she loves visiting, but she's had her last week in your house.", ">It's combined where they stay. The in-laws have a big house so they host for a couple weeks (which Elizabeth prefers because that area feels more like 'home' to her, as she spent a summer there), then Elizabeth and Tim come stay at our home for a week. \n\nWhy is Elizabeth staying at your place for a week instead of staying with the in-laws? Sounds like that would be when Tim could have quality 1-1 time with his dad, as well as spending time with both of you.\n\nNAH, separated parents in different countries is far from ideal and does complicate things.", "Do you feel that your in-laws are sabotaging your relationship?  They are not just inviting but *funding* Elizabeth\u2019s continued presence in your marriage to infinity.  Your husband should have cut that off when his son turned 16, not put the woman in your home.  End of story.  Do your in-laws prefer Elizabeth?  Do you have an uneasy relationship with them or feel they would prefer their son replace you with Elizabeth?  \n\nYou do not deserve this.  You were given to believe this would be over when the young man was 16.  Yet the in-laws and your own husband have paid to ensure Elizabeth was present to prevent any person from forming a relationship with him without her direct involvement. This was unfair to your husband, the child, and YOU.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry about your infertility experience.  It\u2019s just crushing.  But I do hope you get thyself to a qualified therapist forthwith!! Treat this with the urgency it deserves.  You are the only person who can give yourself the life you deserve.  Why are you accepting a \u2018supporting actress\u2019 role in your own life?", "They will all act shocked and say that she never seemed unhappy before. Of course, that's because she accepted the rules of the game.", "The problem is that people don't question these situations or take into account how things will change. They needed to tall through several scenarios and establish boundaries early on. They also should have been having check ins about how things were going and how things might look going forward. Sure husband said this is just until X date, but that date was 10 years in the future. SO MUCH can change in even 1 year. \n\nAlso, it sounds like OP has been suppressing any negative responses to these trips so no one knows that she actually doesn't enjoy them. If the husband changed his relationship to be more friendly (great for coparents!) and OP has just smiled along, everyone may be under the impression that this doesn't bother her. I know people that are actual friends with the SOs exs. It is not unheard of or some wild and crazy thing. She hasn't advocated for herself in over 10 years. Of course no one is worried about how she feels about it. They think she is fine!", "Unless there is some absolutely wild background OP is withholding, it is nuts to me that apparently the kid's *dad* has never had an overnight or a day trip with his son without Elizabeth present. Like, has he ever had even a couple of hours with Tim without her there, until Tim's trip last summer? It's kind of weird that his wealthy parents encourage this. In a comment OP said that, when he found out Elizabeth was pregnant, Robert tried to get into grad school or get a visa to go to her country and couldn't, and that subsequently Elizabeth threatened that if he moved to her country she would break up with him. OP seems to think that there can't be a legal custody arrangement when the parents live in two countries. I'm a little surprised that Robert--who would presumably have had his wealthy parents' backing-- has apparently never even attempted to pursue any amount of custody, despite sending money and making a lot of efforts to see his son. OP said Elizabeth withheld communication with Tim from Robert for *months* after they made a trip over to see him, ostensibly because she was annoyed at having to do logistics for a day trip to another city in her country for her son's birthday. I'm really surprised so many people are saying OP must just be jealous--Elizabeth sounds pretty exhausting, and this situation definitely sounds exhausting.", "To be honest I don\u2019t understand why she still wants to come even though the child can now travel alone. My ex is married and I would rather die than spend 1-2 weeks in his house with him and his wife so our daughter could visit. Your husband should really be more understanding, you haven\u2019t made this A Thing for 13 years. Could you take your own trip while they\u2019re in town?", "OP, you said besides the weeks long in law visits that your husband goes there once a year. Perhaps the next time your husband can instead suggest only Tim comes to your house. That he would like to do X, Y, Z with him. Or not even to your house. To a destination all 3 of you can attend together, without her. He should talk directly to Tim about this possibility. Obviously at some point Mom would need to know & approve but basically Tim is old enough now to want to do things on his own. Also old enough to have a relationship with his father without his mother\u2019s interference. If she says no to this kind of trip for no good reason Tim is old enough to see what\u2019s going on and to start holding her accountable for it. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to always be around her. I can even see your husband being frustrated that he can\u2019t have a relationship with his son one on one. I don\u2019t get her wanting to be ever present but people are weird.

There's no other way she'd come: to rub it in your face more every year.\n\nCan't she  AT LEAST just stay at the in-laws the 3rd week while the kid stays with you?  \n\n\nAnd your husband. THE NERVE.

You daring to be hurt? *The absolute audacity*...  \nHis lack of action \"not to ruin the vibe/cause people to grumble/kill the mood\" (including towards your in-laws' jabs) is **causing you to resent him** and the relationship.  \nIt looks like yet another man putting his spouse last (not second, which was the deal) and then complaining because after 13 years she dares say something... yikies", "Sure.

It\u2019s as if she didn\u2019t get that when she married into HIS family.", "OP wasn't naive about having to deal with mom when the child was still young. She kept her feelings to herself and went along with this for 16 years. The entire point is that the child isn't young anymore. She wants her husband and herself to establish their own relationship and their own sense of family with his son/her stepson. She's looking for an end date on this uncomfortable situation with the ex. \n\nThere's nothing silly about not wanting your husband's ex staying in your house for a week or two every year when the child they share will soon be grown. No one would have this expectation if the ex and child lived in the same area.", "She's not his mom. She's not pretending to be his mom.

His parents are arranging, paying for, and getting the vacation they want. It's not their job to do the same for their adult son; that's his responsibility.", "She sees him 3 weeks a year. What kind of relationship do you expect in that time frame. I see distant cousins more than that.", "No OP already explained that she doesn't get a chance to spend any time with the kid. Her husband claims the WHOLE POINT of OP continuing to host these trips is to build a relationship with Tim but OP never actually gets any opportunities to spend time with him because Tim's mother and her in laws exclude her. OP doesn't see a point in participating because she literally cannot have a relationship with Tim because she cannot interact with him.", "Yep, she could care less about the kid. Maybe he\u2019s the one who feels more comfortable with his mom there? It\u2019s got to be awkward for him too. I doubt he felt comfortable going to stay with them without his mom when he was little and now he\u2019s used to things the way they are. It sounds like everyone gets along fine.

Totally whacked priorities that show she doesn\u2019t care at all about this kid.", "I see. I asked because I don\u2019t think her mere presence should be enough reason to stay away, but as you clarified, it\u2019s not only about that. Did you disclose all that to your husband when you made the decision? And did he defend you when that unpleasant situation happened?\nI can see that in part you seem to be a little jealous of their relationship and the fact they have a son together, and while I can understand why it hurts you (and I feel for you), it\u2019s not reasonable to resent her so much over this. On the other hand, I can also see how your husband could be more supportive in terms of dealing with her and defending you when things go sour.", "OP, you need to put this in your OP and maybe even expand upon your feelings in this situation so you get better feedback. Too many people are going to say you're insecure and it's not about you, etc.\n\nBut my question to them is, if it's not about OP, then why does she need to go? Her sole purpose in being a wife is not to be her husband's emotional meat shield and she doesn't get much time with Tim anyway.", "Sounds like you are in desperate need of therapy to work through your grief over your infertility and the jealousy you feel over the parent connection your has with his ex. It\u2019s your responsibility to deal with all the pain you are feeling. This is beyond the 2 weeks a year you have to see this woman. This comes down to your pain over not having a child of your own. Not seeing this woman will not take this pain away.", "Any examples of what she wrote to him about?", "So her sole purpose in continuing to travel with her son at this age is to prevent OP from ever being a mother to her son.

I would encourage you to get therapy on it.

Why kick up a fuss?", "NAH.\n\nOP, all due respect you sound like you need therapy to deal with the infertility and resentment you feel toward her because of it.\n\nThe last thing you want is, 10 years from now, to have Tim not want you around because you couldn't find a way to not resent his mother for things she has little control over, and it ended up effecting him. If he is used to having both parents around for a 3 weeks a year, you shouldn't try to rob him of that because you can't stand her. You also dont want Robert to resent you (though he SHOULD be more supportive of you and try not to discuss things inf ront of you that bring you hurt- like he did discussing his sons traits and where they came from while you were going through infertility treatment)\n\nThat said, I don't think you're an AH at all- but this woman *is in your life whether you like it or not.* When Tim marries and has kids then it will be holidays with the ex, the grand kids, and you and Tim.

Your husband will still go, the family will still bond and spend time together, and you will know it\u2019s happening, which will still be painful.

Since they live in another country it's not like either father or son can just casually go visit the other so his father and his paternal family can only see him on Tim's school breaks.", "Yes, it\u2019s odd to me that the husband said Tim comes first but he barely sees him except when he visits the grandparents.", "Exactly what other people mentioned here. It's always been a difficult situation, particularly fraught at first. When my husband found out she was pregnant, he tried to get into grad school in that country so he could be closer. He's applied for visas (school and work) multiple times, all rejected. She applied for school here and got in, but declined to come. Early in his son's life when they were trying to make their relationship work, she also told him that IF he moved there, she would break up with him (??).\n\nSo it's just the international travel. He used to go visit one more time during the year, when he was in grad school and had more time available, but it's been harder since then. Now essentially all of his PTO goes to visiting his son, either taking time off when they come here or going there. My husband has been very VERY lucky to have parents with more disposable money so they've been able to help him with plane tickets (when he was in grad school and had no money of his own) and then paying for Elizabeth and Tim's tickets to come here.", "She said she and hubby can afford one ticket - so Tim to come to them.

She's offering to not be there for the whole vacation to minimize her distress.", "It wasn't about her at first until the husband went back on his word. Then when OP said she would just leave because she is very uncomfortable staying with the ex around he guilt tripped her saying he needs her and that she doesn't care about him or the kid, which isn't true. She's been putting their needs first for 13 years and she's had enough. At this point in time, it is in fact about OP", "> I do think you are making this about you when I don\u2019t think it really is.\n\nOP is trying to not be there when the ex is. That is, OP is trying to make the whole situation _less_ about OP, not more. You've got this exactly bass-ackwards.", "Strong disagree here. It's obvious the OP is NOT trying to come first and that she recognizes that Tim and his dad DO come first. That's one reason Elizabeth shouldn't be there. Her presence keeps Tim's dad and Tim from developing a full-fledged, healthy relationship because Liz is always there in her mom role. You're alsoassuming Tim really wants his mommy there, and we have no proof of that. \n\nStepparents are important. They're not the PRIMARY importance, but they have a key role to play. I developed a relationship with my stepson over time, but we *really* bonded in the times we spent skating, sledding, hiking, and talking,  just the two of us. My stepson would agree that I played an important and positive role in his childhood. I never tried to be his mother--he already had a good one--and his dad's relationship with him was of primary importance, but he benefitted from his time with me (and vice-versa). \n\nWhen he was younger, Tim needed someone to accompany him. He did NOT need mommy to stay with him for the entire visit. Elizabeth or whoever accompanied him should have turned around and gone home. It's nice that the grandparents had a good relationship with Elizabeth, but she's not their daughter-in-law. After Tim and their son, their loyalty should be to the person who IS their DIL, not E. I have to wonder how often they see the OP and her husband WITHOUT Elizabeth's presence. \n\nElizabeth and Tim as a package should be welcome at the grandparents at any time OUTSIDE of the visitation.", "This is a good solution that threads a very difficult needle. There's a real downside to drawing this line in the sand, but this proposal also has benefits as it allows Tim to learn how to travel solo and also develop a relationship with his dad and you independent of his mom, which is a big positive as he becomes an adult.", "They seems like a really good possible solution. If Tim is up for a longer trip, there isn't necessarily a reason why he can't spend a couple of weeks with Dad and OP, before flying to Grandparent's place with Dad to meet up with Elizabeth and see the extended family.", "This is great advice, although I don't agree that wanting to see Elizabeth means they are controlling or want them back together. They probably just like her, have a good relationship with her, and want to see her. She's the mother of their grandchild and they have known her a very long time. \n\nBut the separate hosting is a great idea. Could be that Tim doesn't have time or want to travel internationally twice in one year, but if that's the case, there's no reason elizabeth can't stay a shorter time with the grandparents and Tim longer without her.", "You can't really make plans for a minor living on the other side of the world without involving their parent though.", "Unfortunately as someone pointed out below, that's just unrealistic until Tim is an adult - Elizabeth is still the gatekeeper. And even then I still struggle to imagine a scenario where Elizabeth doesn't still pull the strings (see my comment below in this thread).", "My thoughts exactly.  Your husband needs to put on his big boy trouser, thank his parents for helping to facilitate those visits over the past years.  Then tell his parents he will take it from here.  Pay for his txt.  Tim can always spend the final week of his vacation with his grandparents as a compromise and his mother can join him there if she pleases.", "I really like this solution.", "She enjoys her free vacations.", "Exactly this.\n\nElizabeth does not need to follow Tom around.   They can visit with the g'parents, Elizabeth can head home (or wherever, but not to OP's house) and Tim can visit his dad and stepmother.\n\nYou've been patient, accommodating and you've done your duty according to terms you first agreed to.\n\nNTA.", "Maybe Tim wants his mom there.  My son won't visit the other side of his family without me, and it's just a ten minute drive lol.

I wonder how often they get to see the OP and her husband WITHOUT Elizabeth.", "This is why I -generally- don't think childless people should date people who already have children of their own. You'll always take the backseat unless you have your own kids(maybe), and in OP's case she has fertility issues. It has to be devastating having to endure all of that and the present ex who will \"always be family\" knowing you can't have children of your own. And from what it seems like, she has to put her feelings at the back.", "I get what you're saying but judging by the comments it seems there have been issues over the years and she's always been vocal about it.

I\u2019m reality everyone goes about having a good time and the only loser is you for isolating yourself.", "That's fine, but then she shouldn't pretend she wants to build a relationship with Tim.", "Agreed. She put the effort in. She had been understanding of the situation, and she had been dealing with her mentality around the situation for a long time in order to support her husband. Now, the rules have changed, and OP isn't allowed to find another solution to make sure she can stay in a good mental space? Because suddenly, that means she doesn't want a relationship with Tim? That's ridiculous.\n\nThis isn't about her not wanting to connect with Tim, and the bullshit about OP being last is garbage. Sure, Tim takes priority, but why is Elizabeth priority over OP in terms of her husband and the in-laws? And where did this whole \"if Tim wants his mother there\" thing come from? OP said that Elizabeth said she wanted to come each year, not that Tim wanted his mom there.\n\nIt's fine if the in-laws want Elizabeth there. It's fine if the husband is ok with his ex being there, it's also fine for OP to adapt to the changing situation and look for a solution that also allows her to remain in a good mental space.", "Sure, it can and could be about OP. I am not even saying she would be wrong to have it be about her. But that wouldn\u2019t really work towards her goal of wanting a relationship with Tim would it?", "lol could be. But if OP\u2019s goal is to build a relationship with Tim then removing themselves accomplishes the opposite. It shows Tim if he wants a family unit to be harmonious it needs to not include OP. Which is a mistake. Also that line about not being able to be a stepmother when the mother is around tells me there is something deeper here with OPs ideals of motherhood. A step parent is just a bonus parent. Someone extra to love a child. Why would that change if the mother is around?", "Absolutely. OP and her hubby need solo time to bond with the young man without the ex present. The kid is now 16 there is absolutely no need for the Mom to come every\u2026single\u2026time. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnd while international custody may be off the table perhaps they can encourage the son to do a semester abroad at a school near them in the US for college. They can also look into dual citizenship since his Dad is American.", "> This is great advice, although I don't agree that wanting to see Elizabeth means they are controlling or want them back together. They probably just like her, have a good relationship with her, and want to see her. She's the mother of their grandchild and they have known her a very long time.\n\nFor real. It's been 16 years! She IS family at this point, it would be cruel to ask the inlaws to cut contact with someone who's been in their life for so long.\n\nLike it or not, Elizabeth is here to stay. They just need to figure out another way of dealing with the situation.\n\nThough honestly, I'm a bit confused by OP's mention about building a relationship with Tim without his mother present. Again, she's been his step-mom for 13 years, he's almost an adult now. Surely their relationship is built by now? If it's not, then it's never going to be. Of course it will keep changing as he gets older, but not fundamentally.", "To clarify; I wasn\u2019t thinking that they are wrong to enjoy to see her. But I do think they should be understanding if their son\u2019s wife doesn\u2019t want sleepovers with her and would like some time to bond with Tim without Elizabeth present. Just saying that they can (and should) have their own relationship with her, but so can OP and her husband. I would expect the IL to be supportive of them changing the routine a bit now that he\u2019s older. I would just be weary if they get upset.", "THIS. We have absolutely no agency until he's an adult. This part drives my husband crazy because Elizabeth drags her feet as long as possible before committing to dates for any trips, so then he (or his parents, depending on who's buying that particular ticket) spend way more than they needed to on international plane tickets booked like 1-2 months in advance. I WISH we could just buy tickets and make plans...but she probably wouldn't care about blowing them up even after tickets were purchased. It's almost impossible for my husband to get her on the phone to plan things in advance.\n\nEven when Tim is an adult, I strongly suspect he we will be overruled by her all the time. It's just what happens, he's a very polite and accommodating boy. I can imagine him at 25, planning a dream trip with the two of us, but then Elizabeth says she wants to visit here and our trip can be postponed, and Tim acquiesces and agrees its no big deal.", "I wasn\u2019t suggesting that Elizabeth isn\u2019t involved in planning. Or even that she couldn\u2019t come with. But she should buy her own hotel accommodations if she comes (or they can split it if she\u2019s helping to pay the tickets). She doesn\u2019t need to be sleeping at the house of her ex and his wife. She doesn\u2019t need to be hovering over every interaction with his dad unless he\u2019s done something to show him to be irresponsible with their son.", "Sorry, I wasn\u2019t clear. Of course Elizabeth would be involved in the planning. But she doesn\u2019t need to come with on the trip. If she feels uncomfortable with him traveling alone then she can get a hotel for herself. You aren\u2019t required to host her in your home.", "*And* getting under Ops skin!", "No, he came to visit by himself last summer and it was all good - he said he had no issues and claims he wasn't even that nervous to fly alone. When my husband has gone to their country, he's taken Tim for a week and traveled around for the last few years. So it's definitely not that.", "At 16 though?? Most 16 yo's I know would love to travel without their full time parent lol", "Ya but based off how things have been, they\u2019ve never had a chance\u2026. The kids 16 and hasent stayed with his dad alone ever\u2026.", "Not only that, it means Tim had never stayed alone with his dad. Like... ever. Sure they might go out alone, who knows, but as for overnight sleeping, never alone! How weird is that??", "Just because you are fine with a particular situation doesn't mean everyone else has to follow your lead", "You\u2019re incredibly lucky and rare. BM and I are friendly but would never choose to vacation together.", "Good for you, but that doesn't mean everyone should be required to do so. Not everyone is going to get along just because the situation forces them to either. You think you're going to get along with every single person your ex has ever dated, plus all of your exes' current partners? Do you think her current bf should get along with every single ex she's ever had? OP is NTA for not wanting to spend 2-3 weeks *living* with her husband's ex.", "Well done you.\n\nYou're not the one in OPs situation though, are you? You would be equivalent to the ex.\n\nBeing comfortable setting my boundaries is not being insecure - its hilarious that you think someone not having the same boundaries as you means they're insecure.\n\nBTW - next time you catch up with the bf, try having an honest conversation about how comfortable he is with the whole holiday thing. And how much your ex had to pressure him to attend. And whether part of the pressure was that he was uncomfortable with her going on holiday with you.", "That\u2019s great and then your kids will have family picture of both their parents together having fun.", "Sounds like OP has never been in this child\u2019s presence without the mother being there as well. Hard to tell what the kid truly feels in that situation.", "I mean it kind of doesn\u2019t matter for the time he is supposed to be with his did. Kids generally prefer to be with both parents, but people split up and then that isn\u2019t on the table. My daughter would love for me to be with her at her dads house but in that situation what she wants doesn\u2019t trump reality.", "I wonder if the reason mom is coming is by Tim's request", "This here is an important factor.", "There is no conspiracy here. She doesn't know his feelings. And it's not like she can ask him that. \n\nI will say that as much as she loves me, my daughter was really excited the first time she was able to do international travel WITHOUT her parent. I'm sure the teenager would not mind a couple of weeks away from his mother. More a case of mom likes the free vacation.", "And this is a valid point. Tim is 16. If he wants his mom there, she should be there.", "Hanging out with your ex and his wife does not sound like a vacation to me", "Free and all expenses paid", "I could see that being the reason more than the \u201cfree vacation\u201d aspect of this.

If he finds that you want to exclude his mom so that you can have a relationship then you'll have burned your bridges. He doesn't need another mom.

Tell him you would like to get to know him better, but all his time is taken up with his birth family", "Has your husband asked how Tim feels about all this? It seems to me that he is being left out of these discussions as much as you are. Plus, if it were only him coming, he could presumably stay for longer since time off work isn't an issue yet. I do think it's time for your husband to put his foot down and tell his parents to say \"no\" to the Ex participating in custodial visits.", "I'm truly sorry you're going through this; it must be tough feeling obligated to spend time with someone you'd rather not. Unfortunately, she will always be part of your husband's and his parents' lives. She's considered family to them, and given that Tim is still under 18, his mom's presence on trips is understandable and not easily restricted. \n\nShe's valued by your husband's family, and will likely be involved at least until Tim turns 18. It's clear you're eager to bond with Tim, but it seems he's more content with just being with his dad and grandparents. Moreover, she has strong reasons to accompany him \u2013 she's from another country, close to your husband's family, and understandably cautious about letting her young son travel alone. Plus, all her travel expenses are covered, so it's easy for her to accept these trips.\r  \n\r  \nWhile your feelings are completely valid, it's important to recognize that this situation may not change. She will continue to be a part of their lives, and Tim naturally prioritizes his relationship with his father and grandparents. It doesn't seem like anyone is intentionally doing wrong here, so it might be challenging to find a straightforward solution. \n\nTherapy or professional counseling could be beneficial for you to process your feelings, particularly as there might be underlying resentment or jealousy due to your fertility struggles and seeing her with your husband and Tim as a family unit. A professional can help you navigate these complex emotions and find a healthy way forward.", "Your husband could have legal custody. His parents could have spent some money early on to get the legality sorted and for him not to be at the mercy of baby mama. If he wanted to be present in his son\u2019s life and he really came first, your husband would have also made an effort to relocate to where the mom is and be present in his life. It sounds like they have this Disneyland family that you\u2019re not a part of and you\u2019re being well disrespected by her, your in-laws, and most importantly your husband. \n\nBeing a stepparent is a thankless job with a it of bullshit. You need a husband who is on your side and considers you throughout, but it sounds like he\u2019d rather guilt trip you into maintaining the status quo that works for him. You need to be putting yourself first and stop begging him to consider you. Maybe get into therapy? You can\u2019t force him to act a certain way, and you can\u2019t betray your true feelings, so in the end you might just be incompatible, but luckily, there are endless other people if that\u2019s what it comes to.

Pretty sure it was a Facebook message and I don't want to invade his privacy by looking for it.\n\nThe situation was that we traveled to their country to visit for Tim's bday one year. Elizabeth isn't a planner so they usually didn't do much for his birthdays. At that time Robert and Elizabeth's relationship was still a bit tenuous, she was often unpleasant to Robert when he was visiting them (in HER space), she would frequently exercise her veto power (ie blow up plans) she didn't like, and Tim was still kinda young, so Robert would typically just 'go with the flow' for his visits, discussing options with Tim when he got there and taking small day trips or activities. That was the case for this visit, we had ideas but nothing concrete.\n\nOnce we arrived, Tim said that he wanted to visit their country capital for 2 days around his birthday. It was the four of us - Elizabeth, Robert, Tim, myself. I did not plan ANYTHING for this entire visit, because it wasn't about me and I'd never been to this country before. I assumed Elizabeth would be in charge. If not, then Robert as he had visited this country numerous times and it was HIS time with his son. Elizabeth's complaint is that we were not sufficiently helpful when we got to the capital. We couldn't use our cellphones because of the roaming charges, and we didn't have time (this was an impromptu trip within a trip, at least for us) to make a detailed itinerary in the capital, look up restaurants, etc. But she was really annoyed about it all, especially that she was the one with the map (cell phone) who had to do the navigating and figuring out the subway our first day. I can't remember exactly what she later said in the message but essentially she called me a drag, useless, dead weight.\n\nIt was particularly shitty because she ignored my husband (thus preventing him talking to his son) for a month or two after our trip with no explanation, then sent the angry message. And then I couldn't ever let on that I knew what she said, because my husband was worried about her reaction/further cutting off access.", "But...*how* does that actually happen?? This is what I can't figure out. After so many years, they've finally all gotten to a point where she IS family and everyone gets along so well.

I guess OP in that case would even be okay with seeing her for one dinner or something, if they then got two weeks without her? Seems she just doesn\u2019t respect OP and wants to show her who is the dominant female. \n\nI know one couple who are divorced and live in different countries.

OP was very selfless in stepping back, and allowing them that precious time. \n\nHowever, considering he\u2019s 16, and on a completely different continent separated by oceans, I also doubt Tim will ever come to view her as a second/bonus mom. He likely does view her as \u201cdad\u2019s wife\u201d rather than a stepmom. \n\nIt\u2019s a sucky situation, but I think she\u2019s coming to terms with it in a way that makes her feel comfortable.

I\u2019ve known people like this and it is exhausting to waste time researching and making a plan just to have it totally dismissed. Mom is able to be abusive and manipulative to dad and OP because she can hold communication/visitation with Tim over the dad\u2019s head. Their lack of boundaries stems completely from a fear of how mom will react. OP had not been to the country before- Tim\u2019s mom and dad had. How is this OPs responsibility? Is she not under enough emotional duress and now she needs to be responsible for their trip planning too? This or her presence has no alternative value? If that\u2019s true, I don\u2019t see why OP needs to be there at all. Sounds like she is setting healthy boundaries by not wanting to expose herself to this toxic mess of a situation the dad, by choice, has no control over. \n\nOP was in a lose-lose. If OP navigated- something would\u2019ve been wrong with how she navigated or where they chose to go. If OP goes with the flow, we already know that response. Biting your tongue or letting small issues go to keep the peace is one thing, exposing yourself to an extremely uncomfortable situation and being forced to have no boundaries is entirely different. Tim\u2019s mother has NOTHING to do with his relationship with his dad or OP. My ex has nothing to do with me or my partner\u2019s relationship with my children- it\u2019d be fucking weird if he did. \n\nOP, you and your feelings are valid and you do not have to continue putting yourself/your boundaries aside or continue putting yourself in an uncomfortable position to keep your partner\u2019s ex from being abusive and manipulative at your own expense (financially, physically, or mentally).

Thanks!", "It wouldn't really be cutting off ALL time - I'd still drive to hang out at my in-laws their first weekend here, and then they would spend a few days with us at our house.

Right now he is making none and his ex is making none.  Grandparents are paying but no real sacrifice there since they get to see their grandson.

Most of the time the norm is super toxic and the kid suffers. It sounds like a way for the child to not suffer has somehow been found in your situation. I have a hard time seeing the current solution as a bad thing when I have to consider the amount of behavioral therapy my nephew is in because of how his mom is with my brother (she literally ditched her son for almost 3 weeks when my brother proposed to his girlfriend she doesn't want to be with my brother she's just doesn't want him to move on). So the norm with exes with kids is well...bad. Your right that what you have isn't normal but normal isn't really good.

I have a friend who did not get on with her dad (and doesn't really, but is willing to put some of it aside) and hence didn't really talk to or bond with her stepmother because she rarely saw her dad, so stepmom was never really a parental figure. Now that she's an adult, she and her stepmom have a different relationship--not one that's *separate* from her dad completely, but they have their own conversations when she visits, text each other, do things together on visits, and generally have a different dynamic now that they can relate to each other as adults. \n\nIf Tim continues to visit, and becomes more independent from his mom in doing so, he and OP could perhaps develop that kind of relationship.

It sounds like OP WANTS to get to know him and develop that relationship, but that is difficult with his mom always with him (which was understandable when he was younger due to international travel worries).", "Because that\u2019s not always how it works in families.   That\u2019s not how my family is and multiple others I know", "She said that  the grandparents\nsaying Elizabeth is always welcome and is family     And that statements and events like that \u201c were like a death of a thousand cuts.  \u201c.     Not sure how my statement of her viewing Elizabeth as not family is misinterpreting the second to last paragraph.", "TIM wanted to go, for his bday. We arrived in their country not sure what we were doing for the bday and were told that's the plan. Seemed like a great idea at the time, we were all excited. Just turned out terrible because nothing was planned. The root of that is my husband has learned he can't do anything right (his words), when he does make plans they often get dismissed by Elizabeth. It's hard breaking through years of a toxic relationship.", ">She's not his stepmother, she's his Dad's wife \n\nThat's semantics.  And she doesn't get a chance to be a stepmother, does she?  I get the feeling that OP would like to be more involved, particularly as she's referred to infertility issues in other comments.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I used to refer to my (now dead) father's second wife as just that, because in no way was she a mother figure, step or otherwise.  But I think that OP wants more of a relationship with Tim than she will ever have, and Elizabeth's constant presence does seem to be a factor.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one who feels this way. OP has given no real reason why she hates Elizabeth and being jealous of her in-laws liking Elizabeth is childish. Sounds like OP can\u2019t stand not being the main character for a few weeks.", "Meaning the husband went to see his son without his wife. The kids mom was still there. Your being down voted because you don't understand that the point being made is that the father never gets alone time with his son.", "Good luck!! This sucks and there isn\u2019t really a great way to manage it. Him being able to travel and stay on your country\u2019s passport will help facilitate this relationship. You\u2019ve handled this with far more grace than I possess, and you\u2019re in the homestretch. Good luck with all of this. I hope you\u2019re finally able to build an independent relationship with him!", "Is this Japan?", "Just because some families are happy with that arrangement doesn't make it fine for all families. And please keep in mind that while one family views it as having three parents, the OP's family does not. She is basically a non-entity. Furthermore, there is NEVER a time when she and her husband have Tim to themselves.", "But you know lots of other families who don't have week-long sleepovers with their exes, surely.", "We don't know how much she sees her in-laws outside of this visit. It sounds like this is the only time they spend with her, and she's never been the focus of their attention. Have they ever told her that she's family, no matter what? Or are they so focused on maintaining a relationship with their grandson that they haven't made much effort to get to know their son's wife, since she didn't pop out a grandbaby for them? I'm all for not taking everything posters say at face value, but it's a lot easier to see her as the sixth wheel in this family dynamic than as someone insisting on making everything about her. It's great you have a good relationship with your ex and kids, but it sounds like you also are around them a lot more than OP sees these people. How do you form a relationship with someone when you see them for three weeks and they're always more interested in the other people than in you? Over 16 years they've done this, and still she feels like an outsider. It's great that you have a good relationship with your ex's partner, but not everybody is lucky enough to have that sort of set-up.", "I think it's the \"always welcome\" part that was doing the heavy lifting.\n\nBut I assume you do an annual vacation with all of your partner's exes and think this sounds like great fun.", "Well, a lot of people wouldn\u2019t want to live in the same house as their spouse\u2019s ex for weeks at a time every year.\n\nAnd below there are good reasons given, Elizabeth has all the power in this situation and not only does she know it, she openly uses it to control Tim and his family and waste their money, change plans according to whatever she wants, etc. The problem is there is no formal custody agreement, so Tim\u2019s dad really is dependent on Elizabeth to keep *voluntarily* allowing him the small amounts of Tim, often with her, that she allows. The possible consequences of asking her to be more considerate or compromise in any way is that she declines access entirely and they have no recourse, so she holds the nuclear bomb here. And it sounds like she relishes that. A person who truly wanted the other apparently responsible, loving parent to have good access to the child would be more selfless in terms of allowing or even encouraging more contact, less restricted contact, and contact where she is not present for weeks.", "Yes of course.", "No but I do things with and his girlfriend and our kids.  We are a big family.  That\u2019s also how my parents were.", "Not going to lie, I'm on your side, but I can definitely understand why the ex wants to come visit. A free vacation where you're spoiled sounds like something anyone would take. You should absolutely not have to be a part of that, though. She needs to stop coming sometime--it feels like overstepping a line at this point.", "Ridiculous. No sane parent is going to send their young child alone overseas to their ex's rich family in case they never see the kid again. No-one does that. \n\n1-2 months is a perfectly reasonable timeframe to book international travel, it won't cost you any more. Which OP would know if she'd ever travelled to see Tim in his home country, which they apparently never have.\n\nIf her husband wanted more time with his son he could have stayed overseas or could travel to see him there regularly. It sounds to me that the grandparents are the only reason he has any relationship with this child at all.", "What\u2019s it like having them live in your house for a week every year?", "Idk. The ex, regardless of her son,s age, was going for 10+ years. Sounds like part of the family"]}
