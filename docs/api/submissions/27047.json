{"id": 27047, "submission_id": "16l0bed", "title": "AITA for telling my overly sheltered niece that Santa isn't real?", "selftext": "My sister Rae F42 was trying to have a kid for a long time but struggled with infertility. After years of trying and money spent on fertility clinics, she finally had a \u201cmiracle baby\u201d, Sue F12. Since Rae and her husband view Sue\u2019s existence as a miracle, they treat her as one. From the time she could vocalize her wants, she got everything she wanted. As a result, Sue is kind of a nightmare. Whenever our family gets together, we have to do whatever she wants. We have to eat whatever she wants to eat, watch whatever movies she wants to watch, and we can\u2019t do anything outside even though the rest of the family loves the outdoors, because Sue hates nature and will literally scream if she gets so much as a speck of dirt on her shoe. We had to stop doing Christmas together because she would throw  tantrums if my kids got something she wanted. \n\nI keep telling Rae that she is only setting Sue up for failure by spoiling her. Sue has no friends at her school because she doesn\u2019t understand that other kids aren\u2019t going to give her whatever she wants because they don\u2019t see her as a miracle the way her parents do. She also has a bunch of mannerisms that other kids that age grew out of years ago. She still picks her nose in public, still whines and whimpers when things don\u2019t go her way, still shops at Justice, and still believes in Santa and the Easter Bunny. Rae won\u2019t listen to me, and says I should let kids be kids, ignoring the fact that Sue will be a teenager soon.\n\nLast weekend we were all gathered at my parents\u2019 house and Sue was writing a letter to Santa like she did every year. Of course, it was pages and pages long with a list of the most outrageous things a 12 year old could think of. I wasn\u2019t planning on saying anything\u2013I never do\u2013but one day, while Rae was away, Sue and my son Finn M9 came running to me. Sue clearly had been crying and Finn looked rather smug. They both asked me if Santa was real. Normally Sue would never ask me to resolve issues, but her parents weren\u2019t there, and I wasn\u2019t going to coddle her the way her parents did. I said Santa wasn\u2019t real.\n\nThe minute Rae got home, Sue ran to her crying and screaming that I told her Santa wasn\u2019t real. Rae tried to calm her down and told her of course Santa was real and I was lying. When Rae put Sue down for a nap (yes, you read that right), she scolded me. She said I had no business trying to parent her child. I then told her that she wasn\u2019t parenting her child so someone had to. Maybe the first step to self awareness for her is learning Santa isn\u2019t real. I was hoping Rae would wake up and see the reality of the situation, but now she\u2019s just ignoring my texts and calls. When I told my husband about everything, he wasn\u2019t as supportive as I thought he would be. He agrees Sue is unbearable, but it\u2019s not my place to fix that, and what I did probably did more harm than good. Should I have just said Santa was real and not gotten involved in this situation?", "created_utc": 1694956295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l0bed/aita_for_telling_my_overly_sheltered_niece_that/", "score": 2206, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When your child figures out Santa isn't real you work with them to not destroy the dreams of other people by telling them. \n\nMy plan for my 2 year old is that Santa is real.

Her behaviors and lack of social awareness (picking her nose, inflexibility, tantrums, aversion to dirt, needing things to always be her way) could also be something deeper in addition to her being spoiled. Not making excuses for her, but this reads as her mind is underdeveloped for her age and she may be being left behind because everyone attributes these signs to only how she was raised. \n\nThat being said, ESH. Sue sucks, her parents suck for raising her to be a selfish kid who will have a lot of issues due to this in life, and you also suck because it seems like you said this to her because you don\u2019t like her and you wanted to give her a wake up call. It feels like you took this as an opportunity for retaliation since she annoys you, but she\u2019s still a kid and you\u2019re a grown up so you could have been the bigger person. It would have been better to redirect and let your sister know later on when she was back. That\u2019s not to say your sisters right at all, but that\u2019s how you could have avoided being an AH.

Screaming over dirt on her shoe? Needing a nap? Still believing in Santa? \n\nI think something deeper is going on. My first thought was that this kid has a development delay, not a problem with being over indulged. \n\nA spoiled child would be more manipulative, showing almost sociopathic behaviors with no regards to other's feelings because they haven't learned boundaries or consequences. This one is just coming off as being hyper reactive and like something isn't quite...clicking... up there.", "YTA. \n\nThe number one rule of knowing that Santa isn\u2019t real is not spoiling it for others.  You should have deflected the question then later pulled your nine year old aside to discuss this privately.\n\nIt seems like you are trying to justify spoiling the Santa secret by going on about how awful their parenting is (and it is indeed dreadful) and how their child is the worst.

You should have told your niece, \"Ask you parents,\" and then confirmed with your son privately that Santa is not real. I also feel like maybe you relished that moment a bit? \n\nOn the other hand, as someone who has taught for years and is training to be a school psychologist, your sister is doing irreparable harm to her child, and this sort of infantilizing is a form of abuse. Someone who she will listen to (obviously that is not you, I'm sorry) needs to sit her down and have a serious talk with her.

She refuses all screens for her children (they can't even look at photos on Grandma's phone) only get to watch 15 min of TV (live basketball because that's what her husband loves) only home cooked food, no packaged food, no candy, minimal sweets... it's intense.

OP is also not obligated to lie to their own child to keep the secret, especially not a 12 year old.

Kids might also realize sooner because they are exposed to more now.  I recall that I believed in Santa until I was about seven or eight.  At that point, I remember thinking it didn\u2019t make sense.  I continued to pretend for a couple of reasons.  First, I absolutely did believe, with kid logic, that I was getting an extra present out of it.   I was smart enough to realize Santa wasn\u2019t real, but not quite smart enough to figure out that the number of presents would remain the same, lol.  But also, I have a younger sibling and I knew I would be punished if I said a word.  And I was right.  My parents suspected my disbelief and confronted me maybe a year or two after this and actually threatened me with dire consequences if I did not continue to pretend and revealed the non existence of Santa to my sibling.  My sibling continued to believe until age 13.  I think they actually did because they were a rather gullible child.  At that point, my parents told them the truth because it was deemed embarrassing.

Just say something like \"You should talk to your mom about that\".\n\nThe other thing is, speaking as a parent, I raised my kids not to yuck other kids' yum.

The thing is, apparently I was pretty good at the game bc I was shocked to learn last year that 2 of my teen daughters still believed in Santa ... I guess we didn't really talk in depth about Santa,  just that there was always a \"Santa\" gift & some gifts from me.  Several years ago, their older siblings told them, but I said, \" well you always get a gift from Santa soooo\", but I didn't really think they would actually continue believing in Santa.   I explained that Saint Nicholas was a real person who was known to be very generous & enjoyed giving gifts, but died nearly 1700 years ago & we honor him with the tradition of gift giving.

That was her main objective. Not \"the truth\".", "I can believe what I want but I can\u2019t push my beliefs on to other people. That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying. Right? \n\nSo OP should have said ask your parents. Sue was told her belief was a lie. She\u2019s 12. That\u2019s up to her parents to have that conversation with her.", "I saw saw that happen to one of my classmates. It\u2019s not right but it\u2019s what kids do", "Yeah, I would hope that Sue wouldn\u2019t/isn\u2019t get/getting bullied regardless of how insufferable she is, but it seems like the sort of thing that a not-so-kind kid or two could really latch onto.", "This just reminded me.. I told my 4 year old Santa wasn't real.. because she was downright terrified of him coming into our house in the night. It was her first year in school and there was a lot of \"Santa talk\" and the whole concept terrified her (we never played it up for her when she was a toddler, she got a Santa gift but I don't think her brain fully understood the concept at that point). She was terrified of mall Santas, parade Santas, etc. so I told her it was all pretend and they were just friendly people dressing up for fun. She was so relieved. But somehow by next Christmas the belief returned and I think she forgot our conversation.\n\nHmmm, we shall see what she thinks this year...", "The first part of your comment is almost exactly how I found out. But I kept my mouth shut because I have a younger brother and sister and didn't want to ruin anything for them.\n\nI should have spoken to my parents in private. It was kind of rough dealing with \"Santa isn't real\" in private at that age.", "You run up to lines of kids at the mall taking pictures with santa to scream \u201ches not real!\u201d?\n\n\nIf not then surely its because you believe there is a time and place to say that and its not by just dropping the bomb on some kid out of nowhere", "Id be more accepting of that if op didnt make it a point to throw sue under the bus for half the post with info then ended up irrelevant to the situation", "Im sure the boy has his own beefs and resentments with sue\u2019s nonsense but he for sure knew his mom shared the same resentment and took his shot at getting payback on sue.", "There\u2019s a way to tell kids about Santa .... this isn\u2019t the way.", "\u201cYou can talk to your mom about it\u201d isn't a lie. That\u2019s perfectly rational to tell a child.", "That was gonna happen the second she didn\u2019t take Sue\u2019s side regardless, so I don\u2019t know why she shouldn\u2019t have at least taken the opportunity to answer one question honestly- it sounds like *some* adult in this kid\u2019s life needs to, and if her school is full \u201cask your parents, what\u2019s true for one of us might not be true for all of us\u201d then they\u2019re not going to. Did Santa have to be where it started? No. But it was, and bending over backward to shield the kid so that she could say Santa is real in school and find out from kids there wouldn\u2019t have helped either. This isn\u2019t a question of religion, any more than the tooth fairy, and it doesn\u2019t have to be left to the parents to deal with.", "Who says auntie shouldn\u2019t be listened to? The AH parents who are actively destroying their child?", "Also, they\u2019ve had 4 years beyond when kids start figuring it out for themselves to tell her.

They are also abusing everyone else by enabling her.", "You guys really do love in crazy world. \n\nShe is 12 years old. Not 6. It is not a big deal that she knows Santa isn't real, and she asked her aunt who was left to babysit her, and her aunt answered. \n\nShe has done nothing wrong. Her parents haven't given her the coping mechanisms to deal with it, that's not on her aunt either. \n\nIf her mother didn't want her aunt to \"parent\" her, she shouldn't have been left with her aunt as a babysitter. \n\nGenuinely, not a big deal, even though the entitled mother seems to think so.", "He represents ideas or an actual physical person breaking into your house and eating your food?", "I mean this as a compliment to your grandma: hand knitted sweaters are pretty expensive, especially if it's being made just for you.

There was zero intent to be unkind.  It is more unkind to let someone believe a lie and be devastated when they find out the truth - which is exactly what happened when Sue found out at 12 that Santa isn't real - than to tell them the truth in the first place.", "How is unkind to be truthful with a 12 year old about something that 12 year old should know. \n\nThat 12 year old is in 6th or 7th grade. If she goes around talking about Santa at school she is going to be the laughing stock. It is FAR more unkind to keep this illusion of Santa then it is to tell her outright that Santa is not real and that Mom and Dad purchase the gifts. If she found out at school and lost her ever loving mind like she did at OP's house while at school, there would be no coming back from that socially for a long time.\n\nThis is like a 12 year old asking about periods. If Mom is not going to tell her then someone better tell her because its going to happen at some point.", "Hence my other comment where I called her biased.", "Oh that poor girl is *absolutely* getting bullied. Hands down. We had a girl like that when I was in middle school. She was Daddy's Little Princess, and that was just her personality. Hot pink everything, \"Daddy's Little Princess\" on everything, perma baby voice. Her father was a single Dad and worked a temp job that conveniently gave him the ability to move across the country at the drop of a hat, should any reasonable adults start to ask questions about his relationship with his daughter. Yeah. Growing up, and meeting an actual adult with the baby voice, brought her back out of the depths. I hope to *God* she's alright.", "Sue being spoiled is relevant context.

All kids & adults are allowed to believe in whatever magic makes them feel good & happy.", "Not really as the breakdown of the situation is sue (12F) and finn (9m) got into an argument. Sue crying and fin smiling came up to me and asked me if santa was real. I said no. Aita\n\n\nThe several paragraphs of op discussing their disdain for sue and her parents and all her critiques of their parenting dont play a role in what op is asking its just there to make the reader dislike sue before we ever get to the issue at hand.", "Honestly sounds like op would prefer it that way. I mean FFS they can\u2019t even have Christmas together anymore because the 12 year old throws fits that her cousins get presents. Cousins probably would prefer less time too", "Well, that\u2019s their choice. Just like they are choosing to set their miracle baby up for heartbreak and failure.", "I love that you think telling a child their toy is annoying and pointless is the same as not lying to them. Sue is 12, she's going to be facing a lot of social pressure at school soon. She needs real information from the adults around her and she needs to know she can TRUST them so she doesn't end up like the millions of other DARE kids who said \"pot didn't make me worship Satan, guess meth and crack are chill too.\" Kids at my private academic school we're already smoking pot at 12, by the time we were 15 it was 80% of us and not a single kid graduated without trying it. Not all of us were okay after, and it was the CODDLED ones without much trauma that eventually dropped out of college due to alcoholism and addictions. The rest of us knew we couldn't fall back on our parents without wanting to die, so we soared. Them? Not so much. They never knew consequences and thought they'd be fine. Sue is exactly like those kids, except less socially equipped it seems.", "Sue asked OP a direct question. OP answered truthfully, as they should have. That is absolutely not the same as someone sitting next to you with rosary beads who never mentions them to you.\n\nIf OP had just come out and told Sue there is no Santa without the question being posed first, then yes they would be an AH. But in this situation? Hell no.\n\nNTA.", "OP\u2019s son did that job of telling Sue. I don\u2019t hold him responsible he\u2019s 9. He doesn\u2019t know better. OP is an adult. Adults should know better.\n\nDon\u2019t tell people what they can believe in. Period. If I want to believe that wishing on shooting stars is somehow magical who has the right to tell me any different? Whether or not you believe it has nothing to do with me.\n\neta \u2014 I find it absurd that adults can have beliefs that no one should question (breaking a wishbone off a turkey-weird) but if kids believe in Santa at the old age of 12 they need to be told not to believe. It\u2019s like religion. People can have their own beliefs. Not okay to push their beliefs on others. Everyone keep their Santa ideas to their own family.\n\nEdit word"]}
