{"id": 27047, "submission_id": "16l0bed", "title": "AITA for telling my overly sheltered niece that Santa isn't real?", "selftext": "My sister Rae F42 was trying to have a kid for a long time but struggled with infertility. After years of trying and money spent on fertility clinics, she finally had a \u201cmiracle baby\u201d, Sue F12. Since Rae and her husband view Sue\u2019s existence as a miracle, they treat her as one. From the time she could vocalize her wants, she got everything she wanted. As a result, Sue is kind of a nightmare. Whenever our family gets together, we have to do whatever she wants. We have to eat whatever she wants to eat, watch whatever movies she wants to watch, and we can\u2019t do anything outside even though the rest of the family loves the outdoors, because Sue hates nature and will literally scream if she gets so much as a speck of dirt on her shoe. We had to stop doing Christmas together because she would throw  tantrums if my kids got something she wanted. \n\nI keep telling Rae that she is only setting Sue up for failure by spoiling her. Sue has no friends at her school because she doesn\u2019t understand that other kids aren\u2019t going to give her whatever she wants because they don\u2019t see her as a miracle the way her parents do. She also has a bunch of mannerisms that other kids that age grew out of years ago. She still picks her nose in public, still whines and whimpers when things don\u2019t go her way, still shops at Justice, and still believes in Santa and the Easter Bunny. Rae won\u2019t listen to me, and says I should let kids be kids, ignoring the fact that Sue will be a teenager soon.\n\nLast weekend we were all gathered at my parents\u2019 house and Sue was writing a letter to Santa like she did every year. Of course, it was pages and pages long with a list of the most outrageous things a 12 year old could think of. I wasn\u2019t planning on saying anything\u2013I never do\u2013but one day, while Rae was away, Sue and my son Finn M9 came running to me. Sue clearly had been crying and Finn looked rather smug. They both asked me if Santa was real. Normally Sue would never ask me to resolve issues, but her parents weren\u2019t there, and I wasn\u2019t going to coddle her the way her parents did. I said Santa wasn\u2019t real.\n\nThe minute Rae got home, Sue ran to her crying and screaming that I told her Santa wasn\u2019t real. Rae tried to calm her down and told her of course Santa was real and I was lying. When Rae put Sue down for a nap (yes, you read that right), she scolded me. She said I had no business trying to parent her child. I then told her that she wasn\u2019t parenting her child so someone had to. Maybe the first step to self awareness for her is learning Santa isn\u2019t real. I was hoping Rae would wake up and see the reality of the situation, but now she\u2019s just ignoring my texts and calls. When I told my husband about everything, he wasn\u2019t as supportive as I thought he would be. He agrees Sue is unbearable, but it\u2019s not my place to fix that, and what I did probably did more harm than good. Should I have just said Santa was real and not gotten involved in this situation?", "created_utc": 1694956295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16l0bed/aita_for_telling_my_overly_sheltered_niece_that/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Okay then.", "NTA, sooner than later she has to learn the world doesn\u2019t spin around her but the sun. She\u2019s gonna get in for one hell of a awakening when she becomes a adult if they don\u2019t nip it now", "NTA bloody hell it's like your sister is trying to keep her child in the pre-school phase of development and even then is doing a terrible job of it. \n\nYou definitely aren't wrong with your observation that the rest of the world doesn't find her anywhere near as special as her parents.", "ESH. You all deserve one another.", "YTA - I understand why your niece is insufferable, but that was really unkind of you! You could have just uttered a \u2018it\u2019s true for you\u2019 & then taken your son aside for a chat, but instead you let your annoyance guide you & set a crap example for your son.

Her parents didn't like that you told her the truth, but that's on them because they want to/need to lie to her (about Santa and about how the world works). Sue is a person independent to her parents. \n\nSeems like people in your family dislike Sue because of how her parents treat her, her parents  have this whole crazy idea about her because of things that happen to *them* before she was even born...

It\u2019s no one job to answer questions about Santa, God, where babies come from, where people go when they die, etc. Leaves those things to parents. Sue clearly has some delays in her development.

You didn\u2019t maliciously tell Sue Santa wasn\u2019t real however you should probably have a talk with your son and Sue and find out how this topic came up. If your son told his cousin to hurt or taunt her he\u2019s an a hole", "You were caught in a moment and made a quick decision to a crying child.  I'd say NTA, though it depends on how you went about telling her and your explanation of the facts.  She's obviously a delicate child who is spoiled beyond rotten, so she may have needed a more nurturing explanation involving the why's and how's, but again...caught of guard, so I get it.", "Esh. Tbh I think you decided to say Santa's not real instead of ask your mom because to make a reaction. That's the only reason you do. Your sister sucks all around for her parenting choices but I think you chose the wrong battle here. Realistically you don't have the same authority to parent your neice, and if they won't I would think some distance might be what's needed for you and your immediate family.", "You should have said, \u201cthat\u2019s something to ask your mother .\u201d  YTA let them parent their kid how they see fit .", "YTA. Sensitive issues like that deserve a 'talk to your parent about it'. I bet you looked as smug as your son did when you popped Sue's bubble. It's not ok. \n\nI'm not saying the way they're raising Sue is right, but this was not the way to start discussing the issues with your sister. \n\nWe raised our 6yo that from the start, Santa isn't real. He is a nice idea that people like their kids to believe in. We make our own Christmas magic. She knows not to tell anyone (including her older cousin) that Santa isn't real.

They may have the idea that if they admit they *know* there's no Santa their parents will stop providing them with a filled stocking \"from Santa\" .

Your child did that out of spite and being mean. When your child figures out Santa isn't real you work with them to not destroy the dreams of other people by telling them. \n\nMy plan for my 2 year old is that Santa is real. Santa may not be a person real. But is an idea that should last through her life. The idea of giving. And now that she's old enough to understand she can join in on being a Santa... take her to the nearest angel tree and pick out a gift together for a kid in need.", "It is borderline for me since her own younger child was there and I don\u2019t think it is right to lie to YOUR child in that situation. I get the impression that Finn had been the one to tell his cousin Santa isn\u2019t real, but he is young enough that I - a non-parent - would assume lying to them is probably bad.\n\nAlthough given how much she dislikes her niece, I think she enjoyed the chance to take her down a peg.", "Similar in my house.
