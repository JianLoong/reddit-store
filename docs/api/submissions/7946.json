ANYTHING good that happens,  \"praise be to god!\". Anything bad is blamed on people, \"satan\", or bad luck. \nIf 2 people are pulled out from an earthquake, 'god is responsible for saving them'. The 2000 people that died? They were just 'wrong place, wrong time, not god's fault'.\nEven some businesses praise god for their profits, no mention of their employees.", "Yes, and that angle is defamation. OP wants to lawyer up.", "He's not being daft, he's using it to bully somebody.", "Some drinkers annoy the ever living crap out of me. I don't care if you drink, why are you so obsessed with whether I do or don't? \n\n\"Well, one drink won't hurt you.\" \n\nNo, you don't know that. I have two alcoholic parents, (it's genetic), and a history of mental illness. 1 drink is all it could take.\n\nWhy can't people just accept that I'm happy without alcohol and would rather not risk it?", "I couldn\u2019t do NA. Every time I went, it made things worse. I\u2019ve been clean for 5 years without it! Definitely not against NA/AA, especially if it works for others. Like you said, it\u2019s just not for everyone.", "I have a friend who is a recovering alcoholic and went to rehab. It took them a bit to find a program that wasn't 12-step, as they are atheist.", "Fuck could you imagine that?", "I\u2019m not a non drinker I just really don\u2019t drink very much at all on a regular basis. Like, my husband and I bought the Costco wine advent calendar with the intent to share it. It\u2019s 24 half bottles of wine, so about 2 glasses per bottle. We bought it in early November. We\u2019ve opened TWO of the bottles lol. But, when we were on our cruise over Christmas, we drank like fish. No responsibilities, no children to look after, didn\u2019t have to drive, we could do whatever we wanted. But people seem confused that on a regular Friday, the likelihood of me having any alcohol is less than like, 5%", "I just plain don't have the stomach for alcohol anymore, drinking most things makes me feel sick to my stomach. Not my idea of a fun time.\n\nSometimes I might have a single hard lemonade if I really want to, but most of the time I just drink soda or iced tea instead.", "Maybe it depends on your location. I know someone who quit AA (but is still sober) because they put a lot of emphasis on the God part\\].", "Try using it in cooking! My husband got another bottle of wine for Christmas, and we do not drink wine. So just after Christmas I used half a bottle (from 2019, I think) to make coq-au-vin (chicken stew with wine), and today I used the rest for the same recipe.  \nNow we have only 2 bottles remaining.", "My thoughts exactly- no one is this invested in other peoples drinking without a reason.", "It's weird how this kind of behavior clusters together with all kinds of \"sticking it to ...\" other people for their personal choices like veganism or using bikes as means of transportation etc.\n\nAnyone who believes in anything that constitutes better moral choices is seen as a threat that must be humiliated and eliminated.", "I had to go back to verify when he met the BIL. The BIL is horrible.  Telling the family there was an alcohol related incident implies OP was drinking.", "Good thing family believes OP, but they\u2019re in the wrong for suggesting he apologizes.", "Right? Like, if someone is in my home, I will offer them whatever liquids I have. I can get you some wine or a beer, I also have soda and some form of juice on hand, or water, milk, I\u2019ll make you chocolate milk, whatever. I just want you to be comfortable in my house while you\u2019re here. If you turn down one thing or everything, I\u2019m literally not going to question you. Except maybe to ask if you\u2019re sure if you turn down *everything*. I will then tell you that if you change your mind, I can get you something OR if you want to serve yourself, cups are in this cabinet.", "When I host and someone turns down an alcoholic drink, I assume it's because they're driving and offer them either a soft drink or maybe tea or coffee. I don't poke my nose and noone has to explain to me the reasons for declining a drink.", "Yeah I've been pretty quiet about my sobriety as well.  I don't want it to be a \"thing\" with my parents that I only visit twice a year, or to turn my recovery into a central facet of my identity.  I'm hella proud of the progress I've made but haven't really talked to anyone about it IRL except my therapist (before he \"graduated\" me) and my partner, who is the only person who saw on a nightly basis exactly what my addiction entailed.\n\nRecovery programs and communities are excellent tools and having a support system really does help most people, which is why programs and support systems exist.  But I definitely don't agree with the AA steps that make you go all public with it, especially if your problem was never particularly public.\n\nIf you haven't discovered it already, r/stopdrinking is a solid community that is good for support while not doing the higher power thing.  I lurk there on occasion and have gotten some great tips on podcasts/seltzers/whatever for my own journey.\n\nCongrats on your sobriety btw, keep up the good work and be proud of yourself!!  You deserve it. :)", "That\u2019s what I figured. BIL was expecting something out of the 12 steps book as if OP owes him something. What a twisted view on recovery! AA isn\u2019t the only means to recovery. It doesn\u2019t matter how you get there. SMART Recovery is also good.", "Thanks for your kind words of encouragement. I feel the same way about it not wanting it to be an identity thing. That seems be a a central aspect to AA. No thanks!", "Yeah...I'm at a stage in my recovery where it's easier to not drink at all than it is to moderate, but I hate that mindset of just one drink being a failure and frankly am horrified by all the \"cautionary tales\" that I see within recovery communities about how their *just one drink* snowballed into a full six-month bender that got them fired and divorced, or how they accidentally drank a cocktail someone handed them which they didn't realize had alcohol in it and get spun into a panic over it and feel as though it somehow cancels all the work they've put in or will lead to a relapse.  I think anyone who can recognize they have a problem and work to lessen it deserves to be fucking celebrated!!  It's *hard* to face addiction.  And I see those \"cautionary tales\" not so much as warnings against ever drinking a single sip, but as warnings that the mindset of just one sip being a \"failure\" can itself be harmful to one's long-term recovery.", "Omg so true!  My therapist got *all the tea* about my drinking.  I was up front with him about it from our first session and I let him know I felt it was a problem and part of why I was there and that I needed help with it.\n\nAnd he was *so* lovely and non-judgmental about it.  He helped me understand the brain chemistry surrounding why, exactly, alcohol worked so well to help me mitigate anxiety in the short-term (but also why it made my anxiety and depression worse in the long-term).  He told me that his job wasn't to tell me not to drink, and that in fact if reaching for a beer helped me feel better in the moment, then by all means give myself permission to reach for that beer, but that in the meantime we'd work on helping to rebalance my brain chemistry and on developing different (healthier) coping mechanisms for my grief/anxiety/trauma.\n\nGuilting people about their coping mechanism or making them feel like a failure because of it is not the right way to help them.", "Yes yes yes we\u2019re speaking the same language. For some people abstinence is the best choice, temporarily or forever. My issue just lies in the fact that oftentimes the abstinent crowd is incredibly invalidating towards those who moderate and seem to pray on their downfall in a way.", "Maybe it's because those choices are being classified as better morally? When many of them are merely personal life choices, period. They are neither right nor wrong, but are often classified as one or the other regardless.", "That's how it sounds.Going by the Op, A guy who has known him six months said \n\nhe's never seen me apologize and asked I'm ready to apologize now for being an alcoholic. \n\nSo ot sounds like the BIL thinks he should apologize publicly and regularly for being an alcoholic.", "There was an alcohol based incident! BIL was drinking and made a fool out of himself.", "That too.", "I hate step nine! Where's that rum raisin?"]}
