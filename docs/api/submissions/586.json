It's fine.  Let her be mad.  You weren't sh8t-talking her, you were speaking the truth.  Go on about your business.  Learn to stand up to her and refuse to answer her questions.  Then you won't have to go to your dad to get her to back off.  Living with two lawyers has to be tough.  NTA.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t even classify what you did as badmouthing, sounds like you were just discussing that your boundaries were crossed and hoping to find a solution.", "So you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re the asshole for telling your dad your mom is pressuring you? I\u2019m I reading that correctly? If so definitely NTA. Totally normal to express issues with one person to help come to a possible solution. \n\nI see you didn\u2019t vote for who your father was investigating. Good move. Only because as lawyers, I\u2019m sure you know, even if he can share the broad strokes of the investigation there are things they just can\u2019t share (even with you). It leads me personally to believe that your mother and father know something particularly vile about this investigation that you and the rest of the public is currently unaware of.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A rather important part. So that's not shady at all. \n\nFurther she guilt tripped you? You are apparently old enough to vote that means that getting guilt tripped is now on you.... if you are unable to just not tell someone who you voted for maybe you aren't mature enough to vote. \n\nINFO\nHowever your mom clearly doesn't trusts your judgement. That's quite obvious... who is confused while voting. You just color the box.... so what's up with that? \n\nWhy are you so invested in voting for someone who is investigated for corruption by your dad? Seems like a strange hill to die on?", "It's mostly fine, I get told some horror stories of the internet (they take it very seriously). We argue like adults (they have taught me to argue with respect and now that I am an actual legal adult, I wish to behave like).\n\nMy dad is also pretty cool and is fine with telling my mom to calm tf down sometimes.", "Maybe? I don't know, I felt like I intentionally went out of her earshot to tell my dad and said it in a semi-angry tone (I was kinda pissed because... ya know... it's elections, that shit is MEANT to be anonymous)", "It's always like this: My mom does something and I ask dad to tell her to stop instead of telling her directly because I don't have the bravery to say it to her face. I feel like I said it too angrily or used a tone this time and she heard", "I feel like there is a stark difference between a politician you don't know personally persuading you to vote because he has positive ideas for the future and my own mother who I financially depend on telling me that I should not vote for someone or she will be angry at me.\n\nI am not invested in voting for the dude being investigated. I didn't vote for him and I told my mom as such, I was kinda fine with telling her that I didn't vote for one of the 7 candidates, but she kept asking specific stuff. There have been differences in views between my mom and me (because I'm a tend to side with the lgbt-friendly candidates). I voted \"the right way\" and did everything correctly, despite being a bit nervous.\n\nThe \"you might be confused\" is because I get overwhelmed sometimes. Perhaps she doesn't trust my judgement because I might be \"a fresh adult and anxious\" accidentally voting wrong, despite me assuring her that something as important as this is my thing alone (that I have to learn how the world works anyway and this is just a step).\n\nI am not dying on that hill. I also don't like him. I am siding with my dad 100%.", "Exactly, she knew you didn\u2019t want to tell her but forced you to anyway and it is meant to be private. You have every right to be frustrated.", "You were having a normal discussion with your dad about a parenting issue with your mom. It's normal. What would not be normal is not talking about a problem when there is one. NTA", "Oh I see so it\u2019s a pattern. That does change things a little. Maybe a very slight yta but were I you I wouldn\u2019t beat myself up about it. You recognize it isn\u2019t very respectful to talk about her like this behind her back. We can all be better, at least you recognize this fault in yourself. That\u2019s the first step towards improving it. Perhaps your mom tends to be a little over the top because she is aware you don\u2019t take her concerns seriously. I think you know that the only move towards addressing this is having a conversation about it with your mother. Be careful that your apology is sincere and not full of blaming her for your going to your father.", "Your replies make little sense to me. If you weren't invested in voting for this guy. Why was your mom pushing you not to vote for this guy? You weren't already? \n\nSo she was justifiably concerned about the voting booth? Makes sense then. \n\nAgain not telling people who you voted for is your responsibility as an adult.", "Mostly the reason I go to my dad is I am afraid of being yelled at by her. Both of us are too hot-headed and too alike to sometimes see eye-to-eye on stuff, I'm working on it in therapy. I do take the concern seriously as there might be an actual public lawsuit happening", "I wasn't invested but my mom still pushed for me not to vote for him. It also made little sense to me. She was pushing a solved issue\n\nShe was concerned but took it to an extreme measure. I get being concerned, but she doesn't let me do things on my own and wants to do them for me, which then frequently leaves me alone in the dark when I inevitably have to do them myself.\n\nIt is my responsibility, I know. I tried and I gave up too early, but I still don't think that's my fault. There would be no issue had she respected my wish to not talk about it further\n\nThe \"asshole\" part was concerning me going to my dad and asking him if he could talk to her and tell her this is... kinda a shit thing to do instead of telling her face to face (discussed in another comment).", "Just be honest with her, it takes two to help fix issues in a relationship of any kind.", "Yeah, I know, we are actually working on it. Thank you", "So maybe schedule a meeting with your mom every 2 weeks or a month and ask to be able to talk to her about these issues without any yelling on either side? Just both of you getting set time to air grievances and that you promise to work on those things? Maybe over coffee or something? Just don't cut out direct communication with her, that is probably what she is most upset about. She worries you talk about her rather than to her which is valid from your statements. She's a lawyer too, she can learn to keep her cool for your talks. Plus eventually they'll become a cherished part of life where you can discuss life. Good luck and you don't have to tell anyone who you vote for. I don't even always tell my husband."]}
