{"id": 12469, "submission_id": "11t6xfb", "title": "AITA for not giving my family a heads-up that I'm dating again after my husband's death?", "selftext": "My (45F) husband (\"Tim\") and I married right out of college. We had a very happy first decade of marriage, including having two children (\"Luke\" and \"Beth\"), who are now 21M and 19F. However, when in our 30s, Tim developed severe depression and substance use disorder (alcohol and painkillers). His depression was treatment-resistant and that made him unable to fight his other addictions. Despite numerous inpatient psychiatric stays, and several stints in rehab, he passed away of an overdose 5 years ago, at age 40. We don't know, and will likely never know, if the overdose was accidental or intentional.\n\nAfter Tim's passing, I was 100% focused on helping our children be as okay as possible. Despite his demons, he was a great dad when he was able to be, and losing him was completely devastating for all of us. Lots of individual and family therapy helped, and Luke was able to graduate from high school with high honors and get a college scholarship (out of state). Beth graduated last year with similar honors and is also now in college, several states away. \n\nWith both Luke and Beth now adults and away from home, I can finally focus more on myself. It took me a long time (at least 3 years) after Tim's passing before I could even think about wanting to date again. Then for the next year I was focused on getting Beth through her last year of high school and off to college. However, once she went off to school in the fall I started to dip my toe into dating apps. It's been slow going; I've probably had a dozen or so dates total, mostly first dates that didn't go anywhere. There was one guy I went out with 4 times, but we decided not to continue as we weren't feeling a more-than-friendship spark. \n\nSo, here's where the problem is - last week, a cousin of Tim's saw me out on a date - she was in town for business and just happened to be at the same restaurant. She made a bit of a scene (coming up to the table and demanding to know what I was doing with betraying my husband - which really confused the gentleman I was out with). She then stormed out and, apparently, called Tim's parents, who then called Luke and Beth. \n\nNow everyone is furious at me because I hadn't given a heads-up that I was starting to date again. My thought was - I don't need to give the play-by-play on my dating life, especially when it might be hurtful - I figured that if I actually started seeing someone regularly, I would let folks know, but until then there didn't seem to be anything to tell. Especially as Tim's parents live across the country and Luke and Beth are away at college. However, everyone involved (Tim's cousin, his parents, my kids, and assorted other relatives and friends who now know) say I am a huge AH for not telling people in advance that I was moving on.\n\nSo, AITA here? (Not asking if IATA for dating at all; I've been a widow for five years! Just if I am the AH for letting people find out without a proactive heads-up.)", "created_utc": 1679002281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t6xfb/aita_for_not_giving_my_family_a_headsup_that_im/", "score": 1996, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would text her and his parents and tell her that her behavior was disgusting, that your husband would have been ashamed of her and his parents, and that both she and his parents owe your kids and you an apology.

I think they know, on some level, that his demons were just too strong and that I did everything I could to get help for him, but they are still reeling from the loss and need someone to blame. I do get that and don't think there is anything I can do to change that sentiment. So because they blame me, my dating again adds insult to injury. I just wish they wouldn't have involved the kids in their badmouthing of me.", "Not the OP, but I think she is in the USA, given the word-choices: *college* being the strongest example.", "And its been 5 yrs by now since her husbands death!", "I would 100% tell the kids if I actually had a new BF/steady companion, but I figured that the play-by-play on my dating life would be weird and way TMI.", "It sounds like his family are just looking for any excuse to make trouble for her. There was no reason to get mad at her dating *five years* after he died and especially no reason to cause drama with her kids. I\u2019m really rather disgusted with them for dragging her through that.", "I would absolutely have told the kids if they were living at home (or even in the same city), but I'm not sure what they would do at a distance of 1000+ miles even if I did encounter trouble on a date. I do always tell at least one local friend when I'm out with someone new, for safety reasons.\n\nAnd yes, I think that Tim's cousin would have reacted badly even if I were just out with friends or at a business event, because how dare I be out and about having any fun when I'm a widow...", "In retrospect, maybe I should have told the kids - but when I started with the apps I didn't even know if I would meet anyone, or whether I'd go on one date, say, \"NOPE\" and decide to be single. I figured that with being away at college they would have more pressing matters to worry about than my day-to-day social life.", "I definitely would have if they were at home, but didn't see the point of telling them about casual dates when they were away at college. Otherwise I assumed I should share if I actually got into a relationship and was seeing someone regularly (more than a few times anyway). (Just like I don't expect they are going to tell me every time they go on a date, but hope they would tell me if they had a steady partner.)", "I definitely do not think my kids are TA. I understand that a parent dating again after one parent's death is going to be a difficult adjustment, whether it's after 5 months, 5 years or 20 years. They are just upset that I didn't tell them (but not upset that I'm dating in general) and now that the cat's out of the bag, I will be able to share more with them to the extent they want to hear about it.", "Thanks! Yes, it was a happy and loving marriage overall. Tim just got sick with something that turned out to be terminal. We always want to believe that depression and substance abuse are treatable, but in rare cases the battle can just be lost despite exploring all available treatment options. He did try to fight and wanted to be here for the kids, it just got too painful. I forgive him for needing to leave us and work to remember all the good times.", "Yes, I'm already having discussions with the kids. They were initially very upset with me but mostly because it was a rude shock to learn that I'm actually considering having a romantic life after their father. They have both assured me since then that they aren't angry and that I deserve to be happy, that it's just a lot to get used to. They are by far the most reasonable people in this equation, even though they are the most affected if I get into another relationship.", "It's actually a pretty good age to date - I mean, I haven't found anyone I want to be in a committed relationship with, but there are quite a few men in my age range who are divorced or even young widowers, folks who have already had the children they want to have and are looking for a mid-life companion. I'm having a lot of fun getting out, even the one-time dates are generally nice evenings out even if we agree not to continue.", "Really? I'm not there yet but mid 40s hardly seems like an age to give up socializing.", "Yes, that's exactly right. Most of the first dates have just involved a conversation over coffee, a glass of wine, or dinner, to see if we actually want to try dating in a more romantic way. And most of the time, the answer has been, on both sides, \"had a nice time tonight, but not the right match for this time.\" \n\nProbably TMI but I haven't even come close to being intimate with anyone yet...had a few good night handshakes, hugs, and a couple closed-mouth brief kisses but that's all.", "I probably would have given more of a heads-up if we were close. But this particular cousin I hadn't seen or spoken with since Tim's funeral; she didn't make an effort to stay in touch with me. And as for Tim's parents, I had tried to reach out to them regularly after his passing to stay in touch, but they were only occasionally responsive. About a year after his passing they said it was too painful to continue a close relationship with me and that they wanted to keep contact to holiday greetings, barring dire emergencies (they do speak to the kids regularly, though).\n\nAnd I'll also say that none of these people (meaning the adults in Tim's family) reached out to see how they could help/support us while he was battling depression and addiction. His parents were regularly upset with me for not doing enough to \"fix\" him (in their view) and his other family (including the cousin mentioned above) decided they needed to \"detach.\" I do appreciate that is a valid choice, however, I think it minimizes what say they should have in how I currently live my life or communicate about it.", "I\u2019ve lost family too. They don\u2019t need to be told OP is dating again; that\u2019s literally none of their concern. It was disrespectful in the extreme for that cousin to interrupt OP\u2019s date. Five years is more than enough time for them to have come to terms with that grief.", "Sure, that's fair that it probably would have been best to tell the kids I was going to be going on some dates (and that I would let them know if anything came of it). It's just that I didn't start going on dates until they were both out of the house at college, and...it wasn't really the kind of thing I wanted to tell them over text or a phone call. When I got on the apps I wasn't even sure anyone would be interested in a 45-year-old widow.\n\nI will apologize to the kids for not letting them hear from me directly that I've started to get out and meet new people.", "In my case, the family that blamed me was fairly directly responsible for several traumas that resulted in the treatment resistant mental health issues. They likely just don't want to admit it. The only people you may need to talk things through with are your children and your therapist.", "You need to date someone else, and his family is creepy. I\u2019d stay away.", "Wtg OP. Have fun. And go LC with that cousin (And anyone else that gets too judgy)", "As the poster above said, you are a saint. They should be grateful for you  doing everything you could, being the responsible parent, being the rock.", "The whole \u201cbetraying your husband\u201d from a freaking cousin of his, in public, just seems like something off a movie like \u201cmy big fat Greek wedding\u201d or something. Like\u2026 the absolute audacity.", "Your logic is sound and reasonable. Even if it wasn't, it's still your business and not theirs.", "Honestly I think you handled this the best way you could have. There\u2019s no guidebook that tells you how long you have to wait to date after your spouse passed away, nor are there rules that you\u2019re obligated to follow regarding who needs to know and when. Had you been able to tell them I think your kids would have handled this better even if you were saying hey I went on some first dates that weren\u2019t worth anything. Had I been in your shoes I would have wanted to tell them in person and not over the phone. Do whatever you need to do for yourself, because there isn\u2019t a set right way to proceed.", "You\u2019re not wrong about the assumption that they\u2019re busy in college and therefore don\u2019t need to worry about your social life. And again, I never said I thought you should have told them, just that I personally would have. These are your kids, you know them better than anyone (definitely better than me lol). You could always tell them now what you just told me. Be open and honest with them. They might feel weird about this right now (again, pretty mixed emotions, I\u2019m sure), but I bet they ultimately just want you to be happy\u2026regardless of what that looks like.", "I have been in your kids position and honestly, I think they probably would have reacted badly even with the heads up. It is a shock to the system (omg, my mom isn't just my mom) and it hurts (dad is never coming back). I was a total brat about my mom dating again at first.", "For what it's worth I think this is a perfectly reasonable standard! This cousin is bang out of order, and I don't think you need to assume that you must have done SOMETHING wrong and maybe it's not informing your kids that you're going out on a few dates.\n\nReasonable people could choose either path: informing the kids/not informing. That's totally separate from this cousin, who is a loon.", "I would explain it to the kids that way. \n\nYou were not hiding anything from them because you are casually dating. Just like you expect that they are not going to discuss every date they have with you. However if you found someone that you intended to date Long tern of course you would introduce them and discuss it with them. Just like they would do for you. \n\nSometimes it's hard to remember our parents are people too.", "I think it's a bit different when it's your parents, and one has passed away. I probably would have given a general notice that I was dating, not necessarily give them specifics.  Or maybe they already knew that you were dipping your toe again? Not clear.", "I know I'm just some random person on the internet but you sound like a level-headed person and you are NTA at all.", "NTA that cousin is a real jerk. You are totally within your rights to privately give her a piece of your mind", "That\u2019s so nice you\u2019re having fun! As a young woman, men on dating apps (even the ones that are supposed to be for relationships) only ever want to hook up and not even take me out on a date, it\u2019s terrible!", "Holy hell OP...perhaps that should have been in the original post as it really does change things significantly. Lol.", "Please don't apologize to anyone about this. If you feel one is absolutely necessary, please use the weasel-form of an apology - \"I'm sorry you're upset\" - in other words, not an apology for your action, but an expression of your regret at their reaction.\n\nIt's intrusive and gross what they are doing. The only appropriate reaction is \"oh, great, I hope it works out for you.\"", "[deleted]", "Given that Tim's parents (and family in general) have treated me coldly and distantly - not just since his passing, but since he got sick with depression and addiction years before - it definitely wouldn't surprise me if there were some past trauma he just hadn't relayed.\n\nWe all did do lots of therapy, but perhaps another round would be in order now that I'm moving on \"intensively grieving widow\" to \"middle-aged, available single mom.\"", "Yes, I wanted to tell them in person instead of over the phone. I had been thinking about telling them over the winter holidays, but they both decided to spend their break with Tim's parents (both of their colleges are much closer to Tim's parents) and with friends instead of coming the longer distance to see me. This was 100% fine as they hadn't been able to see other family much for the prior couple years because of the pandemic. So I figured I had more time to see if any of my dating attempts amounted to anything.", "Yeah, they are good kids and want me to be happy. I think they are just upset that they found out from others, who told them in a very accusatory and contentious way.", "I had the best of intentions here, in that I thought that my dipping my toe into dating wouldn't hurt them because they wouldn't know about it unless there was something to tell. I didn't want them upset and worried while away at college. I thought of it the same as any other (non-romantic) social activity I have tried out since being widowed, that they're busy with their own lives and don't need the minute to minute detail on mine.", "I think I was following the rule that I've heard for divorced parents - keep your dating life away from your kids, unless it's serious enough that a new partner is going to become a real part of your day-to-day life. Maybe it's different when a parent has passed away...", "Thanks! I will definitely assure them of that. I was not trying to hide anything as much as figure out if there would be anything worth sharing. And of course I would tell them if I started a real relationship.", "No, they didn't know - I hadn't discussed it with them. By the time I went on my first post-widowhood date, both of the kids were away at college. I didn't want them to be worried or upset over nothing (and again, I still haven't met anyone I want to continue dating).", "I was going to originally but ran up against the character limit! But anyway - yes - I do understand that Tim's parents and family are in severe pain from losing him and that the loss of a child or other close relative isn't really something you ever get past. But they have treated me pretty coldly/distantly, and since they told me they didn't want to hear from me except for an emergency - why on earth would I tell them about my casual dating life?", "It is none of the cousin's business.", "I mean, the cousin's reaction doesn't exactly scream \"brought up with healthy emotional coping strategies\" to me. I wonder if that's a common family trait. \n\nAlso, my suggestion for therapy was because you seem to be questioning your decisions, and you're way more likely to get good advice from your therapist than AITA. \n\nEither way, NTA.", "You didn't do anything wrong. I was 22 and living away from home and still didn't take my mom dating well. But it was all about me and not her.", "I am divorced but I can say that I believe you are right no reason to add stress to your kids and probably a lot of emotions they don\u2019t need to worry about while in college unless it is something that could be serious (partner wise).", "I think this is the right way to go about it.\n\nMy mom started dating a few years after my dad died and she gave my sister and I the disgusting play by play (sleepover details and all) about every guy she dated.

NTA.", "Exactly. Tell them that. \n\nIt's hard to see your parent as a sexual being. Especially dating. But you are entitled to see to your own needs.", "I guess what matters is their opinion on it. Did they assume you would start dating at some point-or did they think you would remain single?  I would have been upset to find out, from someone else, that my mother was dating after my father died. Also, it's not something I'd be expecting, given what I know of my mother. I wouldn't have been upset about the dating, mind you, just being in the dark about an important part of her life(looking for love again).", "You are definitely nta, and it is your life to choose how much to share with anyone, honestly. That said, I would have recommended sharing *that* you were casually dating, not the specifics, early on. Why? Because they're gonna have feelings about it at some point and it's probably better to give them time to adjust to those feelings before you *do* meet The One\u2122, so that they don't associate those negative feelings with the person you want them to like and invite into their lives. The divorce rule is really about minor children, yours are adults.", "That's totally fair. I shall change my vote to NTA. Thank you for clarifying.", "Yes, I could definitely use a therapy tune-up.

You are a grown woman who stuck it out through a very difficult situation and obviously loved your husband unconditionally. I think you need to set some boundaries with all involved and remind them that you are a grown woman who is still young and deserves joy, love, compassion and companionship.

It sounds like they all haven't gotten over Tim's death.", "NTA. Man, OP, I\u2019m sorry. It sounds like you loved your husband very much despite his problems and that\u2019s a tragic thing to have to deal with.

More power to you for seeming to have such a level head on your shoulders after all of that.\n\nAll of which being said, you don\u2019t owe your in laws or even your kids any explanation whatsoever. You\u2019re dipping your toes in the water *five years* after the passing of the love of your life and the father of your children.

My ex-husband and I got back together. But why would anyone think that you would remain single? (Unless that is what you want). I think it's easy for some people that have not been widowed to say \"Oh, I'll never date. He's my one and only love\".

You owe them nothing.\nI wish you luck and hope you find love again.", "NTA", "NTA. Your kids are the only ones who may have a somewhat justifiable reason to be upset, only insofar as telling them you\u2019re dating again to avoid this situation. That said, not going to call you an asshole for it and your kids are adult enough that they should be more realistic. \n\nHowever\u2026\n\n>\tAnd I\u2019ll also say that none of these people (meaning the adults in Tim\u2019s family) reached out to see how they could help/support us while he was battling depression and addiction. His parents were regularly upset with me for not doing enough to \u201cfix\u201d him (in their view) and his other family (including the cousin mentioned above) decided they needed to \u201cdetach.\u201d I do appreciate that is a valid choice, however, I think it minimizes what say they should have in how I currently live my life or communicate about it.\n\nThis is complete crap. I would cut your ex in-laws out of your life. They abandoned you emotionally while you and your husband were struggling and now they have the balls to say you\u2019re wrong for dating?

How is it any of their business what you do in your personal life at this point?\n\nAnd \"Betraying your husband\" exactly how?", "NTA. Wow, your family is being super weird about this. Waiting 5 years is plenty, and you shouldn't need to announce to anyone that you're ready to re-enter the dating pool. Seriously.", "NTA. I think it is a good plan not to say anything to anyone unless you were starting to get serious with someone. And Tim\u2019s cousin? WTF? How were you betraying him? Unfortunately he is gone. The vows say til death do us part for a reason.", "Absolutely NTA. Please update us on how you decide to respond to your family- you deserve support, and although I only speak for myself, I'm sure that many other people here want to be able to offer you that, even if just in words, whether it goes well or poorly. \n\nAnd by the way, congratulations on your healing and being willing and able to begin to try and move on. This is a step some widowers never reach, and it's a testament to your tenacity and strength that you've kept yourself and your kids afloat so well in the wake of your husband's passing, and even before that with the issues that plagued him in life.

They definitely would not be complaining about him dating if he stayed single raising your kids solo for five years.\n\nNTA, they don\u2019t deserve to know you\u2019re dating.

But going on a few dates with someone is not major life news that needs to be reported. Yeah, it'd be nice to get a heads-up, but OP is allowed some privacy in her dating life until it becomes relevant to her kids. \n\n>It is no one else's business, but letting them know would have made this a non-issue.\n\nExcept for all the other ppl in O's life who are upset, you mean? I don't know how the kids knowing about this would have affected the cousin's reaction. \n\n>It also gives them lots of time to slowly adjust to the idea instead of you suddenly telling them you are dating and want them to meet someone.\n\nBut that's not what happened, so why are you comparing these two scenarios? It's not like OP has to introduce her new boyfriend to her kids the second they get serious. She can still give her kids time to adjust to the knowledge of her having a boyfriend before making them meet him. \n\n>I would apologize to your kids as they did deserve to hear it from you, not someone else.\n\nWhy should OP apologize for someone else's behavior, especially when OP's own actions weren't in any way bad?", "Yes, most of the dates were first dates.\n\nOne person I went out with twice, but it was a quick coffee one day and then dinner a couple days later (after which we agreed it wasn't a match) - so still not really worth sharing.\n\nAs for the person I went out with four times, we really liked each other as people but just never developed a romantic spark (we were both hoping it would happen and it didn't). Those dates were over a period of about two weeks, but happened to coincide with when both kids had finals at college at the end of the fall semester. So I definitely wasn't going to say anything emotionally upsetting during their finals period, and by the time they were done with the semester, the connection had ended.\n\nI was actually quite disappointed by that one not working out (he was a very nice person, and I wish I felt more of a spark), and took a break for a couple months before looking for/accepting any more dates.", "Thank you, I really appreciate the advice from someone who has been in my position.\n\nI've been talking a lot with Luke and Beth since they found out, and they are over the worst of their upset (at least so they say), they just hadn't any inclination that I was ready to date as I hadn't said anything at all to that effect while they were still home. Once I explained that I had waited until they were away from home so as not to have a bunch of different men coming in and out of their lives casually, they understood why I did things the way I did, even though they are still getting used to the idea of me dating.", "I was also thinking that telling them I was casually dating might be interpreted as \"running around with different men,\" which would somehow seem disrespectful to their father's memory, more disrespectful by far than having another serious, loving relationship.", "Thank you for sharing your story. I am so sorry for your loss, especially while your kids were teens. \n\nWhile Tim was going through his illness, in his moments of clarity he told me several times that if he couldn't conquer his demons, he hoped that I would eventually be able to move on and find someone else (or at least be open to it). Of course at the time I told him not to think like that, but I think of that now when I start to feel guilty about imagining a life beyond Tim.\n\nI did tell the kids (after my secret was spilled by Tim's cousin and parents) that I have only been on a handful of casual dates and that there are no worthwhile connections to discuss in detail yet.", "Hmm, you're right! I mean, she wasn't wrong, but that would have been pretty embarrassing if she had been. \n\nAnyway, she has always been a bit of a dramatic busybody so it's not too surprising things would turn out like this after she saw me.", "The funny thing is that Tim's parents are involved very little in my life these days, by their choice! They went low-contact with me (perfunctory holiday greetings only) shortly after Tim died because they said having a close relationship with me was too painful. So, that's another reason I didn't think to tell them I was dating - because they actually asked me not to reach out to them except for an emergency because it was too hard to hear from me. And I didn't think going on a handful of casual dates was an emergency. If I were getting remarried, then yes, even on a low-contact basis I would have told them, but not about casual dating...", "Thanks! It's scary at times, and I never wanted to be in this position, but I'm (cautiously) excited for the opportunity to make new connections.\n\nAnd I know Tim would want me to find happiness again, especially after the past decade (his illness plus a long period of grief) has been so difficult.", "I\u2019d probably give the kids a general, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to try dating again.

Your kids and their grandparents also lost someone so it's normal they might be upset at first, but that doesn't mean they get to dictate what you do. \n\nCasual dating is completely normal and you only have an obligation to tell people close to you if something starts to get more serious.

They can screw right off.\n\nFor your own kids, they most likely are just upset due to the shock of his family wrongly shoving their noses where they don\u2019t belong and telling your business. They probably always suspected you were dating and now this verifies it and they feel betrayed. But honestly? They are adults. This really has no effect on their day to day (maybe when they come home from school - rare) so you really don\u2019t owe them an answer until you were ready for it. \n\nI promise you they\u2019ll get over it.", "As an adult myself I would be happy for my mother for getting on with her life.

I think it's going to be different for everyone and you just have to do the best you can, which is what it sounds like what you're doing.  I was a kid who lost a parent and personally, I would prefer a heads up that my dad was getting back out there so to speak. I don't want or need a play by play or even that they're going out on specific dates. Just to know that that's where he's at. Not because I'd have a problem with him dating again but because I think it would be really jarring for me to meet someone he was in a serious enough relationship with for us meet when I didn't even know he was dating in the first place.", "I would think it's appropriate to tell kids if there was a good chance they and your date would run into each other at the house. Otherwise, take your time & enjoy", "Right, one of the main reasons I waited until they were both out of the house to start dating again is that I did NOT want to bring a bunch of new men in and out of their lives while they were still actively grieving their father. By waiting, I thought I would be able to explore dating discreetly and at my own pace without subjecting them to all the ups and downs - and then if I did meet someone who was actually going to be a regular part of my life, I could share that. I just didn't count on the coincidence of running into Tim's cousin while on a date, thereby spoiling the chance for discretion...\n\nI suppose the bottom line is that my starting to date probably would have been upsetting - or at least an adjustment - either way. I had the best of intentions here even if I didn't quite get it right.", "The kids are more upset that they found out from someone else rather than from me directly. They have both said since then that it is understandable I would want to date after 5 years, although they need a bit of time to get used to the idea. And thanks for the good wishes!", "That definitely makes sense! I think I did guess wrong regarding whether my kids would have wanted the heads-up about casual dating. All I can do now is apologize, explain, and be more open with them to the extent they want to stay apprised of things.", "Yes, in retrospect I do wish I had gently broached the subject of being ready to start meeting some new people, including dating and potentially finding a new partner.

My dad was a wonderful father and we loved him so much; his sudden death was very hard on all of us. So it was always going to be a bit weird that our mom was dating again. And it wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t want to see her happy, it was just weird seeing her with someone other than our dad.\n\nI have a feeling your kids are probably similar. Once the initial shock wears off they\u2019ll come around. You did *nothing wrong*. The fact is, the cousin went nuclear when it wasn\u2019t necessary. And involving the whole family in your dating life was just vile. You did not deserve that.", "You did nothing wrong. As you are saying, maybe it's dating itself that is the issue, rather than not telling them. Maybe it was a lose lose situation.\n\nYour late husband's cousin, however... What an awful human being.", "I get it. I mean the past few years between your husband\u2019s struggles, and his passing, were no picnic for anyone, I am sure. I am glad they want to see you happy. They were obviously raised well :)", "Yes, they will get over the surprise and upset, and I'm sure they just want you to be happy.  And even as adults, it can take an adjustment period to start seeing our parents as 'people' rather than just parents. Best wishes to you on your journey!", "I wish you luck. Most likely, they will eventually calm down, but it may be an uphill battle for a while due to how they found out.", "I can understand the kids being upset, it\u2019s their own issue though.\n\nOP definitely doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything here and she\u2019s handled it fine.", "I meant, their opinion matters more than any of our comments. I'd be curious to know how her kids felt. If they didn't care, the point is moot(to me).  She's obviously an adult and can handle her life as she wants. But I'd say every parent/child relationship is different, so what should be expected is different, even with adult children.", "Yes, the therapist who helped with my individual grief counseling was fantastic. I have seen her for a couple tune-ups since then, but not in the past couple years. We also had a great family therapist, so I could check with the kids to see if they might be amenable to a Zoom session or two so we can all talk through our feelings about my dating again, with professional guidance.", "NTA. As a very recent widow, I have to just check in and say that it\u2019s no one\u2018s business what you do who you do it with when how or anything else. They have a fat a lot of nerve scolding you. Your cousin is psychotic. Who on earth reaches out to the widows children to gossip like that?", "NTA, your husband passed years ago, did they expect you to never have a relationship again or were you supposed to wait for their permission? You have done nothing wrong, I'm shocked that they think it is any of their business what you do. \n\nMy husband's own immediate family would never interfere like that and his cousins don't even know what I look like. No one I know would ever act like that. This sub has the most ludicrous behavior that I have never encountered IRL.", "NTA we\u2019re you expected to send out the mass text?", "NTA - I would rip the cousin (who is of no relation to you a new one for \u201ctelling\u201d as if she has any say in your life whatsoever). Then I would ream your former in-laws for overstepping with your children. \nGo low, low contact and cut them off for holidays. When everyone is ready to apologize and stfu, I would tell them that any more commentary on your life or interference with your children will result in a permanently severed relationship.", "NTA   I would apologize to my kids though.  (Being open with them encourages them to share with you.). Explain you would have informed them if anything was serious.    \nIf they really upset I would push it.  Each and every time you plan to eat lunch with someone call your kids and act like you are their age and talk about your future plans.  Then afterwards call because you are disappointed.

They will back away.", "NTAH and it's none of their business", "Um. Its literally been 5 years.  My own father died of cancer when I was a baby and my mother was dating by the time I was 2. Absolutely not a soul thought she was in the wrong and I can assure you she wasn\u2019t making announcements to the family about it. And for this cousin to come up to you and start accusing you or betraying your husband?  Who the fuckkkkkkk does she think she is!?  In what world are you expected to need to announce you are dating AFTER 5 YEARS!   Jesus.  People are absolutely insane.  NTA", "NTA She was out of line.  They don't own you.", "This is ridiculous.

(Of course if that was your choice.) You owe no explanation to anyone. They owe you an apology, especially for making it sound like you were currently married. Dating is difficult in the best of times. I feel certain that if you connected with someone, you would say something when you were comfortable. I am sorry for your loss and happy you are doing something for yourself.", "NTA- I think waiting until you're seeing someone regularly makes sense. My dad passed almost 2 years ago. I wouldn't want to hear about my mom dating around, and would be totally okay not knowing she was dating until she actually found a partner.", "Firstly, sorry for your loss. Next definitely NTA.\nI can relate to this story more than anything I have ever read on here. I am currently a middle aged woman, but when I was 14 my father commit suicide after several years of illness and depression. My mother started dating my now stepfather a few months after and boy was I angry and judgmental. To be fair, it could've been several years later and I probably still would have felt the same way. I was wrong. My Mom, though she loved my Dad had not been a wife in years. She was a nurse, she was a therapist, she was crisis negotiator at times, all while trying to raise two kids into functioning adults. But she was not a wife anymore. \nYour kids will never have another Dad, your in-laws will never have another son. But you have the chance to love and be loved again and you deserve that. \nYou didn't need to tell anyone you were dating, you have done nothing wrong. It may take a while, but they will come around. Grief is weird and manifests itself in strange ways. Your kids don't see the whole you, they only know you as their Mom, their rock, and the wife of their father. But you are more than that.\nGood luck with everyone! But from a daughter who has been your daughter and has a few more years under my belt now, she will see the light, as will your son.\nSide note that stepfather I referred to earlier is the super most-best Grandpa that my daughter and her cousins could ask for!", "NTA, on the one hand, I can understand why your kids are upset, I probably would\u2019ve been upset if my mom didn\u2019t give me a heads up when she started dating after my dad died, but ultimately your dating life is nobody\u2019s business and I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to tell your kids until you felt like you\u2019ve met somebody you might get serious with.", "NTA \nYou have the right to your privacy, and to find companionship. \nSorry that you have to deal with all the family drama.  \n\nTotally agree that your husband's cousin completely crossed the line.", "I am so sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc95\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc.

A heads-up about this change lets you control when and how they find out, and gives them time to adapt to the idea.  It's easier to get used to \"mom is going out, now and then, with someone she met on a dating app\" than it would be if they only found out after your relationship was serious.  \n\nAnother point to consider is that your now-adult children probably have more recent dating experience than you do!  \n\nIf they're good kids, and if you're generally pleased with the people they've introduced to you as ones they are dating, they are a valuable resource for you, a window into how the dating scene has changed since you were dating before your marriage.  And if they're generally good-hearted and care for you, they can also be a source of advice, and people who can provide a gentle warning if they see a potential problem.\n\nWhen my parents divorced, me and my brother were adults.  When my dad started dating, both of us saw some red flags in the first relationship he developed.  My brother took him out for lunch, and had a quiet talk with him, explaining our concerns, and assuring my father that he could find someone who was more suitable, and didn't have to settle on the first interested woman.\n\nMy brother found out, then, that my dad had the exact same conversation with his father, after my dad's parents divorced when my father was already an adult!\n\nThe woman my father eventually married, after the divorce, was lovely.  Almost the same age as him, kind, and caring.  He, in turn, doted on her, and on her adult developmentally disabled son.  \n\nSo, talk to your kids.  If you've done a good job raising them, you don't have to stress about always being the \"grown up\" and protecting them.  You can be an adult along with them, now, and learn from the experiences they are having.  \n\nIf you think back to when you were young, and dating before your marriage, odds are good that you had friends close to your age.  And they would meet the people you dated, and if they thought there was a problem, they'd give you a metaphorical slap on the head and tell you that you can do better, and don't settle for someone who will be a problem.  At this point in your life, most of your friends are probably also married, and also years out of the dating scene.   Your adult children can be a way to not have to navigate this 100% alone.", "Nope. They're all lunatics. It's your life. You only live once.", "NTA. MYOB. That would be my response.", "NTA   none of their GD business!  Holy crap!", "NTA\n\nWTF? Tim is dead. How is it a betrayal? \n\nI can come at your kids *maybe* being a bit salty at it, but actually they don't really get to be either. I suspect that if they'd heard it from you, rather than an overly-excited relative, they wouldn't be calling you an AH either.\n\nWho the hell do these people think they are? Do they expect you to be running things by them when you're 50? 60? 75? \n\nHave you asked them when they think it'll be OK for you to live your life without their permission.", "nta! holy crap, FIVE YEARS. it's utterly absurd to think you wouldn't be moving on by then.", "NTA, You are not obligated to give everyone a play b play of your daily life.

It doesn\u2019t mean you didn\u2019t love him or don\u2019t miss him everyday. \nYou are also allowed to take your time telling people. I completely understand about not wanting to tell everyone until you are dating someone regularly/seriously as well!

Wishing you all the best in your own addiction recovery too, I know it is not an easy road.", "I know the current top comment is NTA, but still, this NEEDS to be the top comment!!  I mean, the cousin seems to be implying that OP should have asked her late husband's family permission to start living her life again.  Which is utter BS.  She should not only unfriend anyone from her late husband's family who adheres to this BS, she should completely block them.\n\nHowever, if her kids support their paternal family's views, she needs to have a very open and honest conversation with them about what their father put her through, if they don't know already.  And if they do, and still support their paternal family's views, well, I guess the berries don't fall far from the stem.\n\nNTA", "Thanks! I do think I want to branch out from just using dating apps.

Appreciate the idea!", "The cousin was so far out of line.\n\nOP loved an addict for 20 years. She watched his addiction take him away. She mourned him for 5 years while ensuring her kids were ok. Then she finally starts to live for herself a little bit and her cousin in law accuses her of having an affair in the middle of a restaurant. Absolutely disgusting behaviour.", "I'm so sorry for the recent loss of your husband. I hope you can find happiness and companionship again, whatever that looks like for you. You definitely do not need to justify to anyone anything you are doing to feel less sad.", "Thanks for this perspective! I hadn't thought that my children could be a resource for me as a new dater. Yes, everything is completely different now. I met Tim in college over 25 years ago - I guess online dating was a thing then, but not really something that younger people did. At that time we just met people in class, on campus, etc. There certainly weren't any dating apps, you actually had to go out and meet people in person.\n\nI've had a fair number of dates but as I said, haven't met anyone to spend time with on an ongoing basis, so perhaps the kids would be willing to coach me a bit on achieving better success...", "I didn't start dating until the kids were both away at college, and it didn't seem like the sort of thing I should tell them over the phone or especially a text message - I know that may seem like an excuse now, but there just didn't seem to be a good window to really sit down with them to explain. But I do wish I had found a way.\n\nAs I said in some other posts, some additional info is that Tim's parents went low-contact with me shortly after his death . We still exchange holiday greetings and they are in regular contact with the kids, but they said it was too painful to maintain a close relationship with me. If we had remained very close, I definitely would have at least given strong consideration to giving them a heads-up that I was planning to start dating. But they asked me generally not to contact them unless it was an emergency, and \"I'm starting to go on a few dates\" didn't seem like an emergency given that they barely wanted to be a part of my life anymore.", "The kids never asked me about my dating life, no. When we talked a few times a week, we would talk more about what they were doing at school, their classes and social activities, etc. If they had asked me directly, I would have told them the truth, that I'd gone on a few dates but hadn't yet met anyone worth mentioning yet.", "That's certainly possible! But as I mentioned, Tim's family has been low-contact with me since his death (due to their grief, they said). I hadn't seen the cousin who \"caught\" me on the date since Tim's funeral 5 years ago, and his parents have had little communication with me because they said it was too difficult. Certainly, no one reached out to me to see how I was holding up or if I or the kids needed anything...so it's a bit add that their grief would come up suddenly now.", "THIS! She did this to punish OP, not because she thought the kids deserved to know. What a horrific way for the kids to find out. Ambushed with it by an angry relative, and in a way that makes them feel like they\u2019re *supposed* to be upset. They have every right to feel their feelings about it, but the way your cousin set it up was callous and horrific. \n\nWhat does your late husband\u2019s *cousin* even have to do with this? That seems like such a random relative, were the extremely close or something? What gives?\n\nAnd even then\u2026 op YOU are the one who needs to process you dating again.  That is a very, very intensely personal thing. Why on earth would you want to open yourself up to everyone\u2019s opinions? Why do they HAVE opinions? It\u2019s been years. Why would they not *expect* you to be dating at some point? And if it\u2019s not serious, why on earth would you notify anyone.  You did not become your late husband\u2019s family\u2019s property when you married him, and you are not beholden to them because he died. You are your own person.  You don\u2019t owe them anything, and if they want to remain in your life, they need to let you have one.\n\n**Everything about this is just ludicrous to me. And to be honest it is far from the first time I have heard this happen to someone trying to move on and have a meaningful life after a spouse has passed.** Not just from the late spouse\u2019s family, but from friends and coworkers and even mere acquaintances.  They\u2019re given such sympathy initially, but then expected to remain in perpetual mourning, as if to somehow prove to the world that they loved their spouse at all, as if dating anyone ever again is proof that they *didn\u2019t,* or somehow diminishes it.\n\nPeople who mourned with you or gave your their sympathy don\u2019t need to be acting as if that means they get to have expectations for how you mourn or live, for frankly any length of time. It\u2019s like they put you on a widow-pedestal and expect you to simply stand there alone and in mourning to signify to all that your late spouse was loved. It\u2019s insane, and frankly it\u2019s cruel.  \n\nI think a lot of it has to do with people\u2019s personal insecurities. I feel like people close to him are afraid he will be forgotten, but it\u2019s up to each of them individually, not you, to keep his memory alive for themselves. And I feel like other random people who judge are just afraid to accept the transience of life and the resilience of humanity. People have romanticized marital love into something mythical or destined and don\u2019t want to think of it as it is - real, raw, circumstantial, with no guarantees. **Marriage is a two-way street \u2014 you can\u2019t \u201cbetray\u201d someone who isn\u2019t there to reciprocate your loyalty.**\n\nThe traditional line was literally \u201ctil death do us part.\u201d That\u2019s the timeframe for expected loyalty to a spouse. Not \u201cuntil my dying day\u201d or \u201cin perpetuity and/or until your cousin says it\u2019s okay to move on.\u201d", "OP was having dinner, with a fellow human.

Thank you for writing back and answering my question; I\u2019m also sorry your husband\u2019s family is so unhealthy and a burden rather than a source of support (I understand you realize they aren\u2019t reasonable, and instead of a long explanation of why I think so please let me just say that they are not only not reasonable they are wrong. Extremely, callously wrong.).\n\nYou\u2019re being very considerate; I don\u2019t think you did anything that needs forgiveness from your kids - acceptance and adjustment perhaps, but stronger than that I just don\u2019t see.

I expect you would have eventually... but your cousin was a raging AH for everything they did. No way are you in the wrong. Feel free to cut your cousin and everyone else if you feel you need to. You did not owe them a heads up. After 5 years, it should not have come as any surprise that you would want to date again. They seem to expect youto stay alone for the rest of your life... and that is grossly unfair, and unreasonable.

Can you imagine how it might go if someone in your shoes announced to the extended family chat every time you scheduled coffee or a movie with a potential date!?! That would be utterly ridiculous.

The most change the kids would experience would be having someone new around when they came for the occasional visit. \n\nWith little kids you want to protect them, because it's hard for little kids to repeatedly bond with and then loose the adults in their lives.\n\nWith adult children, that's not so much an issue.

The same privacy can easily blur into secrecy and learning things through gossip and family rumors.  \n\nFor kids young enough to be living with the parent, they're going to pick up on the general fact that the parent is dating, even if they don't meet any of the dates.  Things like the parent going out at dinner time or on a weekend afternoon, a night with their favorite babysitter while the parent is out, etc.  It's bonding with the specific individuals that's an issue.\n\nAdult children, living on their own, won't have those types of clues that dating is happening at all, leading to them being blindsided.  \n\nAnd as adults, they're less likely to worry about a new parental figure in their lives (and be sure to draw boundaries with people you date that they're not going to be new parental figures to your kids!) and they're more likely to be thinking \"Is this person good enough for Our Mom?\"  Just as you make the same evaluation for dates that your adult children might introduce.", "You\u2019re welcome.

Which is what I want for them as long as they are happy with those choices! \n\nBut in any event, even if I did get a new committed partner, that person would not be a part of my kids' daily lives - because the kids are now adults who have their own lives.", "Tim's cousin definitely views it as \"cheating on Tim's memory.\" Except that isn't really a thing - the vows are only \"till death do us part,\" and even if I have some obligation to conduct myself in, I don't know, a classy manner afterwards, all I was doing was having dinner with a gentleman my age at a nice restaurant. It's not like there was any hanky panky or PDA going on. We were only maybe a half hour into the date and were just talking when Tim's cousin accosted us.", "Your kids don't need a heads up every time you have dinner with someone.  Nor do they need to update you about every single outing they have with someone they might potentially want to be involved with. If you start seeing someone on a consistent basis, then mention it.", "Do your kids, their aunts, uncles, cousins etc announce to you everytime they start dating or are interested in someone? Probably, no.\n\nOP you're being viewed as your husbands property. That's how his side of the family sees you. They think that they own you.", "I mean, I understand why they\u2019d be upset finding out from someone who isn\u2019t you, but that\u2019s your husband\u2019s cousin\u2019s fault; not yours. \n\nThat cousin should\u2019ve kept her mouth shut and not spread rumors around because otherwise your kids would\u2019ve found out from you. It\u2019s honestly really gross that your late husband\u2019s family think they have a right to your dating life. It really isn\u2019t any of their beeswax at all. \n\nNone of this is your fault and you\u2019re absolutely NTA.", "This is all on the cousin. Had she not taken upon herself to make public your private matters, you would've had time to figure out when and how to tell your kids. This was not her business to intervene at all although she may have had an emotional response to seeing you on a date, that's about as far she should've left it and kept her opinions to herself. While she was family and may have her own special bond, your husband's death absolutely hit your and your kids lives hardest. For her to insert herself and go publically and judgmentally announcing your personal matters is wildly inappropriate and immature. She is behaving like a child who found her mom dating after her father's passing. It likely required a herculean effort to swallow your grief to care first for your children and now you've done a wonderful job of raising your children and can now focus on yourself. I'm glad you are ready to explore the possibility of finding someone to share the remainder of your life. That's nothing to be ashamed of. If anything, cousin should be ashamed for her inappropriate conduct and she should be the one apologizing. Don't worry about them, OP. Wish only the best for you and much happiness.", "Yeah, definitely not. A few extended family members are active on social media and seem to document every aspect of their social lives, but for the most part, romantic connections fly under the radar until they become more serious. Even with my own kids, they have told me about their committed partners (my son is on his third relationship that I know about, and my daughter on her second - she broke up with her high school boyfriend last year, and recently started seeing someone new in college) but I'm sure they have been on plenty of other dates. And maybe even hookup-type encounters, not that I want to think about all the details, but they are adults and it's their business as long as they're safe.\n\nIn retrospect, Tim's family did always treat me as an accessory instead of as my own person, so it's not surprising they would continue to do so long after his passing.", "NTA. You focused on your kids after your husband died and now they\u2019re off being successful. If anything, I think it\u2019s better you didn\u2019t tell your kids. Not until you actually meet someone your serious with. Your children very likely have \u201cdaddy\u201d issues, so it wouldn\u2019t be good for them to hear about you dating random dudes, it\u2019d be better if they knew you were with someone who loved and cared about you. As for your in laws, you don\u2019t owe them shit. Your late husbands cousin is clearly a pot stirrer, if I were you I would try to cut her out of you and your children\u2019s lives.", "NTA- I was honestly expecting something a lot more risqu\u00e9 than being caught out at dinner by an extended family member. I can imagine those last years of marriage were really tough and probably not a real partnership where you could lean on eachother. After five years you deserve to enjoy yourself especially since your kids are grown. \n\nMy uncle passed away and when his wife started dating again some family members of mine treated her horribly. You deserve to be happy again. You could have another 40 years to spend with someone. Enjoy it.", "You are definitely NTA. You don't owe anyone any explanation about your life and how you see fit to live it. \n\nCalling your kids is a huge AH move. Calling all of these other people? Another huge AH move. \n\nThe only people in this scenario that I'd even think about telling would be my children, but even then,  you're still NTA for not telling them.", "NTA it's your decision when and how you tell people. \n\nMy personal opinion would be to tell the children tbh, maybe the MIL/FIL, but that's it. What the cousin did was a major AH move. To disrupt your date and then calling everyone behind your back...the cousin really needs to think about her/his actions. Wow.", "NTA.", "YTA for not telling your kids but NTA for not telling anyone else.\n\nI feel like, at the very least, a heads up to the kids would be nice. I know they\u2019re adults away at college and you don\u2019t necessarily HAVE to tell them but morally my opinion is you should have. Everyone else can just butt out.", "NTA. You don't owe your late husband's family or anyone else for that matter, anything.", "NTA! You\u2019re a widow of 5 years. Your children are not small and you did everything you could to support them following the death of your husband. You don\u2019t owe anyone any explanation as to your dating life. If there\u2019s anyone to have a conversation with, it would be your children but again, that isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s business! \n\nYou aren\u2019t moving on from anything. You\u2019re living your life. You\u2019re were widowed, you didn\u2019t die. You did nothing wrong and I wish you the best in this new phase of your life.", "Man, Tim's family sounds terrible.  \nNTA.", "Honestly the only ones that matter are your kids. Ask them how they feel, and then explain you didn\u2019t want to talk about it unless something serious happened. You thought it would gross them out to talk about your dating life (even if that\u2019s a lie). After all I doubt you hound them for every failed first date \n\nNta", "NTA unfortunately, I lost my father as a teenager, so it might not be the same circumstances as your life, but I feel my opinion is valid here. My mother did start dating again a little over a year after my father passed, when I and my younger brother found out we were actually happy for her. We knew we would never get a new \u201cfather\u201d but what we were concerned about was her being alone for the rest of her life. She has since stopped dating which I am sorry for her, but it\u2019s her life and all I want for her and you is to be loved and happy. \n\nPlease sit down with your kids and remind them that you are not and could not replace their father, everyone else can fluff off. And if they won\u2019t send them my way, I can prepare a few choice words for them. \n\nIf you want to be way more generous than they have any right to have, you can let them know that your life was destroyed when your husband passed away and you will always love him, but you arnt dead and deserve some sort of happiness and that they are not entitled to know about it and definitely not entitled to an opinion. If they can\u2019t handle that, they can support you by not being part of your life. \n\nMany hugs. Do not worry you did nothing wrong and in my opinion doing something positive for yourself. This is the exact advice I have given my mother.", "NTA. You owe no one an explanation. It\u2019s your life and you should be happy too.", "NTA. My beloved neice died of cancer and 2 years later I heard her husband was starting to date. I was saddened but I asked myself what would I have told her if he was the one to pass. I would have told her we want to be alive to live. And having love is part of living well.", "Oh dear, I have second hand anger for you. I would have read Tim\u2019s cousin and parents the riot act for telling my children. It is so incredibly inappropriate and inconsiderate\u2026. There would have been a severe consequences for such an egregious laps in judgement. YOU should be the one to tell your children, in your time. Tim\u2019s cousin is a selfish prick. Nta", "NTA  You grieved long enough for propriety and for yourself.  You don't have to tell anyone what is going on in your private life until it's pertinent.  Good luck.", "So it's been at least 4 years since he died and they still feel entitled to control your personal life? NTA", "NTA. Dating again after the death of a spouse is a vulnerable and private thing. That is even more so when you\u2019ve had as painful and complicated a second half of marriage as you must have had. You are not betraying anyone and you didn\u2019t owe anyone a heads up - not even your own children,  certainly not this outrageously rude and interfering cousin. \n\nYou had every right to keep this private aspect of a new chapter of your life to yourself until you felt you had something meaningful to share. And frankly, hysterical and unreasonable attitudes about \u2018betrayal\u2019 of husband who has been dead for 5 years and who you stood by in difficult times when many would not, are a good enough reason not to have wanted to tell people right away.", "To Tim\u2019s cousin:\n\n\u201cWho the F do you think you are? And why the F do I owe you or ANYONE a report or explanation of MY activities?\n\nDoes \u2018till death do us part\u2019 sound familiar? You called Tim\u2019s parents and involved MY children. F you!\n\nDo not be defensive. \n\nNTA", "NTA, your family needs to learn boundaries. \n\nTheir expectations of you have nothing to do with you, and the feelings they\u2019re experiencing are due to whatever they have going on in their heads. \n\nYou don\u2019t have anything to do with the version of you they created in their heads.", "NTA. You have been a widow for 5 years and only middle aged. Stats say you about 30 years left of life. That's 30 more summers that you don't want to spend without a romantic partner. Would a heads up been nice for your kids and in-laws? Sure but given this reaction they had it seems doubtful they would have taken the news well anyway.", "NTA.  For the reasons you stated.  It is your life.  If you found someone you were interested in for more than just a couple of dates, but since you haven't, there was no reason to tell anybody (except maybe a close friend for safety reasons who can keep tabs on you while you are on said dates with people you meet from an app).", "NTA.  You should tell Luke and Beth that you're starting to date again because it's important to model thriving after tragedy to your kids.  You should also tell the rest of those people to fuck right off because it's important to model healthy boundaries to your kids.", "Make it right with your kids. Ignore anyone else, they should be ashamed of themselves. \n\nNTA", "Wow, NTA it\u2019s been 5yrs not two weeks. It was one date and there was nothing to say. You\u2019re not a child who needs to tell everyone what they are doing.", "I\u2019m so sorry your privacy and your autonomy was disrespected in this manner. You deserved your space and your freedom to explore and your husband\u2018s family made it all about them and their grief. It was despicable.  \n\nGoing on you need to sit down and have a talk with them. Tell them if you\u2019re still grieving you understand and you will not wave your relationship in their face, but Your dating life is no longer their business. Tell them you won\u2019t hide if they ask about how you\u2019re doing if you\u2019re dating again but you won\u2019t go and report to them your every move. Firm boundaries.  With your family, kids and everyone who thinks that you\u2019re dating life is part of their business.\n\nNTA", "It is none of their business. NTA.", "FFS, it's been five years since Tim passed, it's absurd that they would be angry, and no, you don't owe them a heads up AT ALL.", "NTA. You devoted yourself to your children after becoming a widow and didn't date until they both graduated high school and moved on to college. Not everyone would sacrifice having a personal life even under those circumstances. I commend you for it. It sounds like your kids got all the attention and support they needed. Single parenting is an extremely tough job, especially to grieving kids. You deserve respect for that. Instead you get abuse, being yelled at in public and torn down by your late husband's family? Did they expect you to stay in a formal state of mourning for the rest of your life? It's just plain weird. I don't blame you for not mentioning it to your kids. Like you said, they're away at school and you thought you could have some privacy. Maybe you should have said something, but honestly, this is one of those parenting decisions where you could flip a coin and go with either approach. Some kids might get annoyed and prefer not to know about their mom going on dates. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA, they didn't need a heads up about what you do with your life, Tim's cousin should have minded her damned business, and 1. Not make a scene, and 2. Not blast you to everyone else. I understand your kids being upset that they found out from someone else, but that's the thing, they would have found out from you when you were ready to tell them if the cousin kept her mouth shut.", "The AH is the one who confronted you to start with!!!", "NTA you\u2019re a grown woman and you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation.", "I'm glad this wasn't a business meeting. Your husband's cousin had no reason to confront you. Five years is more than respectable for mourning. NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA but that would be startling but NOT ENOUGH TO MAKE A SCENE AND SAY YOU BETRAYED SOMEONE WHO OVERDOSED?????", "NTA. That cousin sounds annoying as shit. You're a grown up doing grown up things. You deserve to live life to the fullest. I've already told my wife that if I passed before her, she should do whatever she wanted. If that means her finding new love, I support her decision 100%.", "Your private life is\u2026 *drumroll* private! You have zero obligation to anyone to talk about if you are dating or not. Not a single person in your life needs a \u201dheads up\u201d, its not about them and it will never be. Im so sorry about your husband, but im glad to hear your kids have been doing well and im super happy that you are out dating again. I wish you all the best!\n\nSuper NTA", "NTA. this is the same as outing someone to their relatives. i get the kids being upset, like \"ma i cant believe youve moved on. i havent.\" what i dont get is why the extended family is upset too. like, are they jealous you're getting some excitement after all that?", "NTA. Apparently your former in-laws expected you to never move on from their relative. Probably because they put him on a pedestal he shouldn't be on. That can happen when we loose someone we love. The only 2 I feel you should have let know you were going to try dating again were your kids. Why, because they're your kids. If they're mature adults they would understand and be supportive. You didn't give them that chance. They heard it from everyone else in the worst light possible. I know how your kids feel on a personal level. My Mom moved on after 2 months after my Father died. She told us she was going to start trying to date 8 months after he passed. We were cool with it until we found out she lied about the time frame. She was seeing our future step-father for 6 of those months. It was a shock and betrayal big time. Not the fact that she was dating, but the fact that she didn't tell us and chose to lie about it. Omission is a lie. I realize it's been 5 years. You didn't rush things. You are right to not hold the candle and vigil for Tim forever. You have the right to love again. Go for it. All I'm saying is you should have let the kids know first. Then if they weren't the mature adults you worked so hard to raise, you could work from that with them- as a family. You need to talk to your kids, have a frank and open discussion with them. You don't owe Tim's family ANY explanation. When it comes right down to it, they aren't family anymore except emotionally.", "NTA\n\nYou don't need anyone's permission to date. Your husband is dead. You're vows say that death will part you, and it has. As you said, it's one thing if you were in a more serious situation, but you are only casually dating at the moment. That cousin of Tim's deserves a serious verbal lashing for not only imparting themselves during you date, but also going to everyone else. I would make a public post online and tell anyone who wants to tell you how to run your dating and sex life must first tell you about their love life and sex life, otherwise, they can f\\*\\*\\* off.", "What, do they expect you to be like fucking Rose in Titanic?\n\n>It's been 84 years....\n\nIt's been 3 YEARS, and more importantly, it's your life. \n\nNTA.", "OP, do a mass FB post. Talk about how lived your husband was by you, but it has been years, and if they cannot support you dating or not, they will be blocked fully.  Then do it.  You did a great job with your family.  You did good.  You need no permission. Your kids, have an adult talk with them, point out they do not clear their dates with you or you them if they say one word.  Ask how long you are supposed to wait, then hand them logic.  This is a them problem., Be kind but firm.", "Fellow widow here\u2026.NTA!!!! You don\u2019t owe anyone, anything! It won\u2019t affect how your children are raised anymore. You aren\u2019t looking for a new son or brother or cousin for the family. Your private life is private and that cousin should have kept their mouth shut. Try to remember that their reaction is a product of their own grief and not your job to take on their grief.", "NTA. It's irrelevant if it never gets past first dates. It's only important if it actually becomes something.  And you aren't betraying anyone, you are allowed to move on and tell people when you are ready", "As a widow, I told my deceased partner's mother (who I remain on excellent terms with) and that was it. And I still only told her after there was something to tell. A few random dates that don't go anywhere aren't changes to what's going on to the lives of other people. I was a little worried about how other people might take it, but honestly, I just really didn't want anybody else involved until I'd figured it out myself. \nIf you've never been through it it is very hard to convey how entitled to being involved in your life after being widowed other people think they are. It is astonishing how many people after my partner died decided they needed to be involved in every action I took afterwards. I want to be charitable and say that it is because they wanted to retain any piece of my partner they could cling to in their grief, which definitely made me the main focus, but going through it was horrible. I was already an introvert before he died, but that experience (not just his death but other people's reactions to me and continued barging into my life and involving themselves with my choices and path) nearly made me a complete recluse.", "It appears as if they expect she will be alone and grieving forever, that was soooooo mean. She is trying to get a life and they have invaded her privacy, horrible horrible people.", "She even mentioned these were casual dates. It\u2019s not like she was in a full blown relationship and just not telling anyone (her kids really). I wouldn\u2019t really care to know about a ton of casual one or two time dates my mom had been on.", "Yes, that's exactly it - I thought it would make them upset/anxious for really no reason, and also be a bit of TMI, to tell them specifics about dates that didn't mean anything. I do believe I took that too far by not telling them that, in general, I was starting to go out on a few dates, but I had the best of intentions, to try to figure out this dating thing, something I hadn't done in over 25 years, without involving the kids emotionally.", "Thanks! For safety reasons, I do tell at least one friend when I am going on a first date with a new person.", "You're exactly right in thinking that way. I'm about your age, and dating is tough. You could go on 50 dates and only end up with  with 50 meals with strangers that range from painful to mildly entertaining and nothing else. Unless something grows from that, I would see no reason to tell anyone of it. Especially since meeting people you don't know is emotionally exhausting all by itself, much less adding having to give a summary report about it to everyone you know.  \n\nAlso, you're cousin's a real asshole.", "No, don\u2019t change your mind.  You dating is none of your kids business until you decide it is.  If the guy/gal isn\u2019t moving in or showing up to family events, it is not their concern.  They may want a heads up, but wants aren\u2019t rights in this case.  They don\u2019t have a right to your private life at their age.", "I think that your kids deserve a bit of a non-apology from you \u2014 an \u201cI\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t find out from me.\u201d Reassure them that you had planned on telling them as soon as you progressed past the \u2018first dates\u2019 stage and into genuine connection (you *did* plan on doing that right?) This should be a conversation focused on the adult relationship you\u2019re clearly cultivating with your children, but needs to take into account the fact that they\u2019re still, in many ways, your *children* and not independent adults \u2014 not least of which is that they probably still are financially dependent on you and live in the family home on breaks. \n\nThey need to know that you\u2019re not trying to keep them in the dark, them finding out from a cousin surely caused them to doubt what their family life and support will look like in the future. Just let them know that whenever there\u2019s something to share, you\u2019ll share it, and be prepared to introduce them to future partners.\n\nNTA.", "Yes - I have already apologized for not giving them a general heads-up about dating - and explained that I have been on a handful of dates, but haven't really connected with anyone yet. That there didn't seem to be anything noteworthy to share given that I haven't made an ongoing romantic connection yet - but that of course I would share if I actually got into a relationship.\n\nThe kids have already accepted my apology and have just said (understandably) that it will take them a little while to get used to the idea of me dating again.", "NTA. You don't owe anything to Tim's family, especially if they didn't see you as anything more as Tim's wife and caregiver."]}
