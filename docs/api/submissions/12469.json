{"id": 12469, "submission_id": "11t6xfb", "title": "AITA for not giving my family a heads-up that I'm dating again after my husband's death?", "selftext": "My (45F) husband (\"Tim\") and I married right out of college. We had a very happy first decade of marriage, including having two children (\"Luke\" and \"Beth\"), who are now 21M and 19F. However, when in our 30s, Tim developed severe depression and substance use disorder (alcohol and painkillers). His depression was treatment-resistant and that made him unable to fight his other addictions. Despite numerous inpatient psychiatric stays, and several stints in rehab, he passed away of an overdose 5 years ago, at age 40. We don't know, and will likely never know, if the overdose was accidental or intentional.\n\nAfter Tim's passing, I was 100% focused on helping our children be as okay as possible. Despite his demons, he was a great dad when he was able to be, and losing him was completely devastating for all of us. Lots of individual and family therapy helped, and Luke was able to graduate from high school with high honors and get a college scholarship (out of state). Beth graduated last year with similar honors and is also now in college, several states away. \n\nWith both Luke and Beth now adults and away from home, I can finally focus more on myself. It took me a long time (at least 3 years) after Tim's passing before I could even think about wanting to date again. Then for the next year I was focused on getting Beth through her last year of high school and off to college. However, once she went off to school in the fall I started to dip my toe into dating apps. It's been slow going; I've probably had a dozen or so dates total, mostly first dates that didn't go anywhere. There was one guy I went out with 4 times, but we decided not to continue as we weren't feeling a more-than-friendship spark. \n\nSo, here's where the problem is - last week, a cousin of Tim's saw me out on a date - she was in town for business and just happened to be at the same restaurant. She made a bit of a scene (coming up to the table and demanding to know what I was doing with betraying my husband - which really confused the gentleman I was out with). She then stormed out and, apparently, called Tim's parents, who then called Luke and Beth. \n\nNow everyone is furious at me because I hadn't given a heads-up that I was starting to date again. My thought was - I don't need to give the play-by-play on my dating life, especially when it might be hurtful - I figured that if I actually started seeing someone regularly, I would let folks know, but until then there didn't seem to be anything to tell. Especially as Tim's parents live across the country and Luke and Beth are away at college. However, everyone involved (Tim's cousin, his parents, my kids, and assorted other relatives and friends who now know) say I am a huge AH for not telling people in advance that I was moving on.\n\nSo, AITA here? (Not asking if IATA for dating at all; I've been a widow for five years! Just if I am the AH for letting people find out without a proactive heads-up.)", "created_utc": 1679002281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t6xfb/aita_for_not_giving_my_family_a_headsup_that_im/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was no reason to get mad at her dating *five years* after he died and especially no reason to cause drama with her kids. I\u2019m really rather disgusted with them for dragging her through that.", "I would absolutely have told the kids if they were living at home (or even in the same city), but I'm not sure what they would do at a distance of 1000+ miles even if I did encounter trouble on a date. I do always tell at least one local friend when I'm out with someone new, for safety reasons.\n\nAnd yes, I think that Tim's cousin would have reacted badly even if I were just out with friends or at a business event, because how dare I be out and about having any fun when I'm a widow...", "In retrospect, maybe I should have told the kids - but when I started with the apps I didn't even know if I would meet anyone, or whether I'd go on one date, say, \"NOPE\" and decide to be single. I figured that with being away at college they would have more pressing matters to worry about than my day-to-day social life.", "I definitely would have if they were at home, but didn't see the point of telling them about casual dates when they were away at college. Otherwise I assumed I should share if I actually got into a relationship and was seeing someone regularly (more than a few times anyway). (Just like I don't expect they are going to tell me every time they go on a date, but hope they would tell me if they had a steady partner.)", "I definitely do not think my kids are TA. I understand that a parent dating again after one parent's death is going to be a difficult adjustment, whether it's after 5 months, 5 years or 20 years. They are just upset that I didn't tell them (but not upset that I'm dating in general) and now that the cat's out of the bag, I will be able to share more with them to the extent they want to hear about it.", "Thanks! Yes, it was a happy and loving marriage overall. Tim just got sick with something that turned out to be terminal. We always want to believe that depression and substance abuse are treatable, but in rare cases the battle can just be lost despite exploring all available treatment options. He did try to fight and wanted to be here for the kids, it just got too painful. I forgive him for needing to leave us and work to remember all the good times.", "Yes, I'm already having discussions with the kids. They were initially very upset with me but mostly because it was a rude shock to learn that I'm actually considering having a romantic life after their father. They have both assured me since then that they aren't angry and that I deserve to be happy, that it's just a lot to get used to. They are by far the most reasonable people in this equation, even though they are the most affected if I get into another relationship.", "It's actually a pretty good age to date - I mean, I haven't found anyone I want to be in a committed relationship with, but there are quite a few men in my age range who are divorced or even young widowers, folks who have already had the children they want to have and are looking for a mid-life companion. I'm having a lot of fun getting out, even the one-time dates are generally nice evenings out even if we agree not to continue.", "Really? I'm not there yet but mid 40s hardly seems like an age to give up socializing.", "Yes, that's exactly right. Most of the first dates have just involved a conversation over coffee, a glass of wine, or dinner, to see if we actually want to try dating in a more romantic way. And most of the time, the answer has been, on both sides, \"had a nice time tonight, but not the right match for this time.\" \n\nProbably TMI but I haven't even come close to being intimate with anyone yet...had a few good night handshakes, hugs, and a couple closed-mouth brief kisses but that's all.", "I probably would have given more of a heads-up if we were close. But this particular cousin I hadn't seen or spoken with since Tim's funeral; she didn't make an effort to stay in touch with me. And as for Tim's parents, I had tried to reach out to them regularly after his passing to stay in touch, but they were only occasionally responsive. About a year after his passing they said it was too painful to continue a close relationship with me and that they wanted to keep contact to holiday greetings, barring dire emergencies (they do speak to the kids regularly, though).\n\nAnd I'll also say that none of these people (meaning the adults in Tim's family) reached out to see how they could help/support us while he was battling depression and addiction. His parents were regularly upset with me for not doing enough to \"fix\" him (in their view) and his other family (including the cousin mentioned above) decided they needed to \"detach.\" I do appreciate that is a valid choice, however, I think it minimizes what say they should have in how I currently live my life or communicate about it.", "I\u2019ve lost family too. They don\u2019t need to be told OP is dating again; that\u2019s literally none of their concern. It was disrespectful in the extreme for that cousin to interrupt OP\u2019s date. Five years is more than enough time for them to have come to terms with that grief.", "Sure, that's fair that it probably would have been best to tell the kids I was going to be going on some dates (and that I would let them know if anything came of it). It's just that I didn't start going on dates until they were both out of the house at college, and...it wasn't really the kind of thing I wanted to tell them over text or a phone call. When I got on the apps I wasn't even sure anyone would be interested in a 45-year-old widow.\n\nI will apologize to the kids for not letting them hear from me directly that I've started to get out and meet new people.", "In my case, the family that blamed me was fairly directly responsible for several traumas that resulted in the treatment resistant mental health issues. They likely just don't want to admit it. The only people you may need to talk things through with are your children and your therapist.", "You need to date someone else, and his family is creepy. I\u2019d stay away.", "Wtg OP. Have fun. And go LC with that cousin (And anyone else that gets too judgy)", "As the poster above said, you are a saint. They should be grateful for you  doing everything you could, being the responsible parent, being the rock.", "The whole \u201cbetraying your husband\u201d from a freaking cousin of his, in public, just seems like something off a movie like \u201cmy big fat Greek wedding\u201d or something. Like\u2026 the absolute audacity.", "Your logic is sound and reasonable. Even if it wasn't, it's still your business and not theirs.", "Honestly I think you handled this the best way you could have. There\u2019s no guidebook that tells you how long you have to wait to date after your spouse passed away, nor are there rules that you\u2019re obligated to follow regarding who needs to know and when. Had you been able to tell them I think your kids would have handled this better even if you were saying hey I went on some first dates that weren\u2019t worth anything. Had I been in your shoes I would have wanted to tell them in person and not over the phone. Do whatever you need to do for yourself, because there isn\u2019t a set right way to proceed.", "You\u2019re not wrong about the assumption that they\u2019re busy in college and therefore don\u2019t need to worry about your social life. And again, I never said I thought you should have told them, just that I personally would have. These are your kids, you know them better than anyone (definitely better than me lol). You could always tell them now what you just told me. Be open and honest with them. They might feel weird about this right now (again, pretty mixed emotions, I\u2019m sure), but I bet they ultimately just want you to be happy\u2026regardless of what that looks like.", "I have been in your kids position and honestly, I think they probably would have reacted badly even with the heads up. It is a shock to the system (omg, my mom isn't just my mom) and it hurts (dad is never coming back). I was a total brat about my mom dating again at first.", "For what it's worth I think this is a perfectly reasonable standard! This cousin is bang out of order, and I don't think you need to assume that you must have done SOMETHING wrong and maybe it's not informing your kids that you're going out on a few dates.\n\nReasonable people could choose either path: informing the kids/not informing. That's totally separate from this cousin, who is a loon.", "I would explain it to the kids that way. \n\nYou were not hiding anything from them because you are casually dating. Just like you expect that they are not going to discuss every date they have with you. However if you found someone that you intended to date Long tern of course you would introduce them and discuss it with them. Just like they would do for you. \n\nSometimes it's hard to remember our parents are people too.", "I think it's a bit different when it's your parents, and one has passed away. I probably would have given a general notice that I was dating, not necessarily give them specifics.  Or maybe they already knew that you were dipping your toe again? Not clear.", "I know I'm just some random person on the internet but you sound like a level-headed person and you are NTA at all.", "NTA that cousin is a real jerk. You are totally within your rights to privately give her a piece of your mind", "That\u2019s so nice you\u2019re having fun! As a young woman, men on dating apps (even the ones that are supposed to be for relationships) only ever want to hook up and not even take me out on a date, it\u2019s terrible!", "Holy hell OP...perhaps that should have been in the original post as it really does change things significantly. Lol.", "Please don't apologize to anyone about this. If you feel one is absolutely necessary, please use the weasel-form of an apology - \"I'm sorry you're upset\" - in other words, not an apology for your action, but an expression of your regret at their reaction.\n\nIt's intrusive and gross what they are doing. The only appropriate reaction is \"oh, great, I hope it works out for you.\"", "[deleted]", "Given that Tim's parents (and family in general) have treated me coldly and distantly - not just since his passing, but since he got sick with depression and addiction years before - it definitely wouldn't surprise me if there were some past trauma he just hadn't relayed.\n\nWe all did do lots of therapy, but perhaps another round would be in order now that I'm moving on \"intensively grieving widow\" to \"middle-aged, available single mom.\"", "Yes, I wanted to tell them in person instead of over the phone. I had been thinking about telling them over the winter holidays, but they both decided to spend their break with Tim's parents (both of their colleges are much closer to Tim's parents) and with friends instead of coming the longer distance to see me. This was 100% fine as they hadn't been able to see other family much for the prior couple years because of the pandemic. So I figured I had more time to see if any of my dating attempts amounted to anything.", "Yeah, they are good kids and want me to be happy. I think they are just upset that they found out from others, who told them in a very accusatory and contentious way.", "I had the best of intentions here, in that I thought that my dipping my toe into dating wouldn't hurt them because they wouldn't know about it unless there was something to tell. I didn't want them upset and worried while away at college. I thought of it the same as any other (non-romantic) social activity I have tried out since being widowed, that they're busy with their own lives and don't need the minute to minute detail on mine.", "I think I was following the rule that I've heard for divorced parents - keep your dating life away from your kids, unless it's serious enough that a new partner is going to become a real part of your day-to-day life. Maybe it's different when a parent has passed away...", "Thanks! I will definitely assure them of that. I was not trying to hide anything as much as figure out if there would be anything worth sharing. And of course I would tell them if I started a real relationship.", "No, they didn't know - I hadn't discussed it with them. By the time I went on my first post-widowhood date, both of the kids were away at college. I didn't want them to be worried or upset over nothing (and again, I still haven't met anyone I want to continue dating).", "I was going to originally but ran up against the character limit! But anyway - yes - I do understand that Tim's parents and family are in severe pain from losing him and that the loss of a child or other close relative isn't really something you ever get past. But they have treated me pretty coldly/distantly, and since they told me they didn't want to hear from me except for an emergency - why on earth would I tell them about my casual dating life?", "It is none of the cousin's business.", "I mean, the cousin's reaction doesn't exactly scream \"brought up with healthy emotional coping strategies\" to me. I wonder if that's a common family trait. \n\nAlso, my suggestion for therapy was because you seem to be questioning your decisions, and you're way more likely to get good advice from your therapist than AITA. \n\nEither way, NTA.", "You didn't do anything wrong. I was 22 and living away from home and still didn't take my mom dating well. But it was all about me and not her.", "I am divorced but I can say that I believe you are right no reason to add stress to your kids and probably a lot of emotions they don\u2019t need to worry about while in college unless it is something that could be serious (partner wise).", "I think this is the right way to go about it.\n\nMy mom started dating a few years after my dad died and she gave my sister and I the disgusting play by play (sleepover details and all) about every guy she dated. A few of them tried to be our \u201cnew daddy\u201d and I had one come by my work at one point to \u201cmake sure I was okay\u201d.\n\nKids do not need to know every single detail of your dating life. When you find someone you really click with, that\u2019s when you should tell them. As for your husbands parents, what jerks. They had no business getting upset or even getting your kids involved. I\u2019m really sorry they\u2019re causing so much drama for you.", "Your reasoning is exactly right, 2 of my closest friends are widowers before 30, they did exactly what you are doing, the only exception is their respective families respected them enough to know it's not really their business and let them know that as well. NTA.", "Exactly. Tell them that. \n\nIt's hard to see your parent as a sexual being. Especially dating. But you are entitled to see to your own needs.", "I guess what matters is their opinion on it. Did they assume you would start dating at some point-or did they think you would remain single?  I would have been upset to find out, from someone else, that my mother was dating after my father died. Also, it's not something I'd be expecting, given what I know of my mother. I wouldn't have been upset about the dating, mind you, just being in the dark about an important part of her life(looking for love again).", "You are definitely nta, and it is your life to choose how much to share with anyone, honestly. That said, I would have recommended sharing *that* you were casually dating, not the specifics, early on. Why? Because they're gonna have feelings about it at some point and it's probably better to give them time to adjust to those feelings before you *do* meet The One\u2122, so that they don't associate those negative feelings with the person you want them to like and invite into their lives. The divorce rule is really about minor children, yours are adults.", "That's totally fair. I shall change my vote to NTA. Thank you for clarifying.", "Yes, I could definitely use a therapy tune-up. My prior round of therapy was aimed at dealing with grief and loss and being supportive for the kids, and at that time I wasn't even close to contemplating dating again (or dealing with people who might judge me for it).", "Their opinion does not really matter. They are adults now and away at college. She is an adult her husband has been dead FIVE years. How she handles her dating life and when she chooses to divulge thay information is solely her business and no one has any right, not even her kids, to be mad at her about it."]}
