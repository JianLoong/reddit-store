{"id": 12469, "submission_id": "11t6xfb", "title": "AITA for not giving my family a heads-up that I'm dating again after my husband's death?", "selftext": "My (45F) husband (\"Tim\") and I married right out of college. We had a very happy first decade of marriage, including having two children (\"Luke\" and \"Beth\"), who are now 21M and 19F. However, when in our 30s, Tim developed severe depression and substance use disorder (alcohol and painkillers). His depression was treatment-resistant and that made him unable to fight his other addictions. Despite numerous inpatient psychiatric stays, and several stints in rehab, he passed away of an overdose 5 years ago, at age 40. We don't know, and will likely never know, if the overdose was accidental or intentional.\n\nAfter Tim's passing, I was 100% focused on helping our children be as okay as possible. Despite his demons, he was a great dad when he was able to be, and losing him was completely devastating for all of us. Lots of individual and family therapy helped, and Luke was able to graduate from high school with high honors and get a college scholarship (out of state). Beth graduated last year with similar honors and is also now in college, several states away. \n\nWith both Luke and Beth now adults and away from home, I can finally focus more on myself. It took me a long time (at least 3 years) after Tim's passing before I could even think about wanting to date again. Then for the next year I was focused on getting Beth through her last year of high school and off to college. However, once she went off to school in the fall I started to dip my toe into dating apps. It's been slow going; I've probably had a dozen or so dates total, mostly first dates that didn't go anywhere. There was one guy I went out with 4 times, but we decided not to continue as we weren't feeling a more-than-friendship spark. \n\nSo, here's where the problem is - last week, a cousin of Tim's saw me out on a date - she was in town for business and just happened to be at the same restaurant. She made a bit of a scene (coming up to the table and demanding to know what I was doing with betraying my husband - which really confused the gentleman I was out with). She then stormed out and, apparently, called Tim's parents, who then called Luke and Beth. \n\nNow everyone is furious at me because I hadn't given a heads-up that I was starting to date again. My thought was - I don't need to give the play-by-play on my dating life, especially when it might be hurtful - I figured that if I actually started seeing someone regularly, I would let folks know, but until then there didn't seem to be anything to tell. Especially as Tim's parents live across the country and Luke and Beth are away at college. However, everyone involved (Tim's cousin, his parents, my kids, and assorted other relatives and friends who now know) say I am a huge AH for not telling people in advance that I was moving on.\n\nSo, AITA here? (Not asking if IATA for dating at all; I've been a widow for five years! Just if I am the AH for letting people find out without a proactive heads-up.)", "created_utc": 1679002281, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11t6xfb/aita_for_not_giving_my_family_a_headsup_that_im/", "score": 484, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would text her and his parents and tell her that her behavior was disgusting, that your husband would have been ashamed of her and his parents, and that both she and his parents owe your kids and you an apology.

I think they know, on some level, that his demons were just too strong and that I did everything I could to get help for him, but they are still reeling from the loss and need someone to blame. I do get that and don't think there is anything I can do to change that sentiment. So because they blame me, my dating again adds insult to injury. I just wish they wouldn't have involved the kids in their badmouthing of me.", "Not the OP, but I think she is in the USA, given the word-choices: *college* being the strongest example.", "And its been 5 yrs by now since her husbands death!", "I would 100% tell the kids if I actually had a new BF/steady companion, but I figured that the play-by-play on my dating life would be weird and way TMI.", "It sounds like his family are just looking for any excuse to make trouble for her. There was no reason to get mad at her dating *five years* after he died and especially no reason to cause drama with her kids. I\u2019m really rather disgusted with them for dragging her through that.", "I would absolutely have told the kids if they were living at home (or even in the same city), but I'm not sure what they would do at a distance of 1000+ miles even if I did encounter trouble on a date. I do always tell at least one local friend when I'm out with someone new, for safety reasons.\n\nAnd yes, I think that Tim's cousin would have reacted badly even if I were just out with friends or at a business event, because how dare I be out and about having any fun when I'm a widow...", "In retrospect, maybe I should have told the kids - but when I started with the apps I didn't even know if I would meet anyone, or whether I'd go on one date, say, \"NOPE\" and decide to be single. I figured that with being away at college they would have more pressing matters to worry about than my day-to-day social life.", "I definitely would have if they were at home, but didn't see the point of telling them about casual dates when they were away at college. Otherwise I assumed I should share if I actually got into a relationship and was seeing someone regularly (more than a few times anyway). (Just like I don't expect they are going to tell me every time they go on a date, but hope they would tell me if they had a steady partner.)", "I definitely do not think my kids are TA. I understand that a parent dating again after one parent's death is going to be a difficult adjustment, whether it's after 5 months, 5 years or 20 years. They are just upset that I didn't tell them (but not upset that I'm dating in general) and now that the cat's out of the bag, I will be able to share more with them to the extent they want to hear about it.", "Thanks! Yes, it was a happy and loving marriage overall. Tim just got sick with something that turned out to be terminal. We always want to believe that depression and substance abuse are treatable, but in rare cases the battle can just be lost despite exploring all available treatment options. He did try to fight and wanted to be here for the kids, it just got too painful. I forgive him for needing to leave us and work to remember all the good times.", "Yes, I'm already having discussions with the kids. They were initially very upset with me but mostly because it was a rude shock to learn that I'm actually considering having a romantic life after their father. They have both assured me since then that they aren't angry and that I deserve to be happy, that it's just a lot to get used to. They are by far the most reasonable people in this equation, even though they are the most affected if I get into another relationship.", "It's actually a pretty good age to date - I mean, I haven't found anyone I want to be in a committed relationship with, but there are quite a few men in my age range who are divorced or even young widowers, folks who have already had the children they want to have and are looking for a mid-life companion. I'm having a lot of fun getting out, even the one-time dates are generally nice evenings out even if we agree not to continue.", "Really? I'm not there yet but mid 40s hardly seems like an age to give up socializing.", "Yes, that's exactly right. Most of the first dates have just involved a conversation over coffee, a glass of wine, or dinner, to see if we actually want to try dating in a more romantic way. And most of the time, the answer has been, on both sides, \"had a nice time tonight, but not the right match for this time.\" \n\nProbably TMI but I haven't even come close to being intimate with anyone yet...had a few good night handshakes, hugs, and a couple closed-mouth brief kisses but that's all.", "I probably would have given more of a heads-up if we were close. But this particular cousin I hadn't seen or spoken with since Tim's funeral; she didn't make an effort to stay in touch with me. And as for Tim's parents, I had tried to reach out to them regularly after his passing to stay in touch, but they were only occasionally responsive. About a year after his passing they said it was too painful to continue a close relationship with me and that they wanted to keep contact to holiday greetings, barring dire emergencies (they do speak to the kids regularly, though).\n\nAnd I'll also say that none of these people (meaning the adults in Tim's family) reached out to see how they could help/support us while he was battling depression and addiction. His parents were regularly upset with me for not doing enough to \"fix\" him (in their view) and his other family (including the cousin mentioned above) decided they needed to \"detach.\" I do appreciate that is a valid choice, however, I think it minimizes what say they should have in how I currently live my life or communicate about it.", "I\u2019ve lost family too. They don\u2019t need to be told OP is dating again; that\u2019s literally none of their concern. It was disrespectful in the extreme for that cousin to interrupt OP\u2019s date. Five years is more than enough time for them to have come to terms with that grief.", "Sure, that's fair that it probably would have been best to tell the kids I was going to be going on some dates (and that I would let them know if anything came of it). It's just that I didn't start going on dates until they were both out of the house at college, and...it wasn't really the kind of thing I wanted to tell them over text or a phone call. When I got on the apps I wasn't even sure anyone would be interested in a 45-year-old widow.\n\nI will apologize to the kids for not letting them hear from me directly that I've started to get out and meet new people.", "In my case, the family that blamed me was fairly directly responsible for several traumas that resulted in the treatment resistant mental health issues. They likely just don't want to admit it. The only people you may need to talk things through with are your children and your therapist.", "You need to date someone else, and his family is creepy. I\u2019d stay away.", "Wtg OP. Have fun. And go LC with that cousin (And anyone else that gets too judgy)", "As the poster above said, you are a saint. They should be grateful for you  doing everything you could, being the responsible parent, being the rock.", "The whole \u201cbetraying your husband\u201d from a freaking cousin of his, in public, just seems like something off a movie like \u201cmy big fat Greek wedding\u201d or something. Like\u2026 the absolute audacity.", "Your logic is sound and reasonable. Even if it wasn't, it's still your business and not theirs.", "Honestly I think you handled this the best way you could have. There\u2019s no guidebook that tells you how long you have to wait to date after your spouse passed away, nor are there rules that you\u2019re obligated to follow regarding who needs to know and when. Had you been able to tell them I think your kids would have handled this better even if you were saying hey I went on some first dates that weren\u2019t worth anything. Had I been in your shoes I would have wanted to tell them in person and not over the phone. Do whatever you need to do for yourself, because there isn\u2019t a set right way to proceed.", "You\u2019re not wrong about the assumption that they\u2019re busy in college and therefore don\u2019t need to worry about your social life. And again, I never said I thought you should have told them, just that I personally would have. These are your kids, you know them better than anyone (definitely better than me lol). You could always tell them now what you just told me. Be open and honest with them. They might feel weird about this right now (again, pretty mixed emotions, I\u2019m sure), but I bet they ultimately just want you to be happy\u2026regardless of what that looks like.", "I have been in your kids position and honestly, I think they probably would have reacted badly even with the heads up. It is a shock to the system (omg, my mom isn't just my mom) and it hurts (dad is never coming back). I was a total brat about my mom dating again at first.", "For what it's worth I think this is a perfectly reasonable standard! This cousin is bang out of order, and I don't think you need to assume that you must have done SOMETHING wrong and maybe it's not informing your kids that you're going out on a few dates.\n\nReasonable people could choose either path: informing the kids/not informing. That's totally separate from this cousin, who is a loon.", "I would explain it to the kids that way. \n\nYou were not hiding anything from them because you are casually dating. Just like you expect that they are not going to discuss every date they have with you. However if you found someone that you intended to date Long tern of course you would introduce them and discuss it with them. Just like they would do for you. \n\nSometimes it's hard to remember our parents are people too.", "I think it's a bit different when it's your parents, and one has passed away. I probably would have given a general notice that I was dating, not necessarily give them specifics.  Or maybe they already knew that you were dipping your toe again? Not clear.", "I know I'm just some random person on the internet but you sound like a level-headed person and you are NTA at all.", "NTA that cousin is a real jerk. You are totally within your rights to privately give her a piece of your mind", "That\u2019s so nice you\u2019re having fun! As a young woman, men on dating apps (even the ones that are supposed to be for relationships) only ever want to hook up and not even take me out on a date, it\u2019s terrible!", "Holy hell OP...perhaps that should have been in the original post as it really does change things significantly. Lol.", "Please don't apologize to anyone about this. If you feel one is absolutely necessary, please use the weasel-form of an apology - \"I'm sorry you're upset\" - in other words, not an apology for your action, but an expression of your regret at their reaction.\n\nIt's intrusive and gross what they are doing. The only appropriate reaction is \"oh, great, I hope it works out for you.\"", "[deleted]", "Given that Tim's parents (and family in general) have treated me coldly and distantly - not just since his passing, but since he got sick with depression and addiction years before - it definitely wouldn't surprise me if there were some past trauma he just hadn't relayed.\n\nWe all did do lots of therapy, but perhaps another round would be in order now that I'm moving on \"intensively grieving widow\" to \"middle-aged, available single mom.\"", "Yes, I wanted to tell them in person instead of over the phone. I had been thinking about telling them over the winter holidays, but they both decided to spend their break with Tim's parents (both of their colleges are much closer to Tim's parents) and with friends instead of coming the longer distance to see me. This was 100% fine as they hadn't been able to see other family much for the prior couple years because of the pandemic. So I figured I had more time to see if any of my dating attempts amounted to anything.", "Yeah, they are good kids and want me to be happy. I think they are just upset that they found out from others, who told them in a very accusatory and contentious way.", "I had the best of intentions here, in that I thought that my dipping my toe into dating wouldn't hurt them because they wouldn't know about it unless there was something to tell. I didn't want them upset and worried while away at college. I thought of it the same as any other (non-romantic) social activity I have tried out since being widowed, that they're busy with their own lives and don't need the minute to minute detail on mine.", "I think I was following the rule that I've heard for divorced parents - keep your dating life away from your kids, unless it's serious enough that a new partner is going to become a real part of your day-to-day life. Maybe it's different when a parent has passed away...", "Thanks! I will definitely assure them of that. I was not trying to hide anything as much as figure out if there would be anything worth sharing. And of course I would tell them if I started a real relationship.", "No, they didn't know - I hadn't discussed it with them. By the time I went on my first post-widowhood date, both of the kids were away at college. I didn't want them to be worried or upset over nothing (and again, I still haven't met anyone I want to continue dating).", "I was going to originally but ran up against the character limit! But anyway - yes - I do understand that Tim's parents and family are in severe pain from losing him and that the loss of a child or other close relative isn't really something you ever get past. But they have treated me pretty coldly/distantly, and since they told me they didn't want to hear from me except for an emergency - why on earth would I tell them about my casual dating life?", "It is none of the cousin's business.", "I mean, the cousin's reaction doesn't exactly scream \"brought up with healthy emotional coping strategies\" to me. I wonder if that's a common family trait. \n\nAlso, my suggestion for therapy was because you seem to be questioning your decisions, and you're way more likely to get good advice from your therapist than AITA. \n\nEither way, NTA.", "You didn't do anything wrong. I was 22 and living away from home and still didn't take my mom dating well. But it was all about me and not her.", "I am divorced but I can say that I believe you are right no reason to add stress to your kids and probably a lot of emotions they don\u2019t need to worry about while in college unless it is something that could be serious (partner wise).", "I think this is the right way to go about it.\n\nMy mom started dating a few years after my dad died and she gave my sister and I the disgusting play by play (sleepover details and all) about every guy she dated.

NTA.", "Exactly. Tell them that. \n\nIt's hard to see your parent as a sexual being. Especially dating. But you are entitled to see to your own needs.", "I guess what matters is their opinion on it. Did they assume you would start dating at some point-or did they think you would remain single?  I would have been upset to find out, from someone else, that my mother was dating after my father died. Also, it's not something I'd be expecting, given what I know of my mother. I wouldn't have been upset about the dating, mind you, just being in the dark about an important part of her life(looking for love again).", "You are definitely nta, and it is your life to choose how much to share with anyone, honestly. That said, I would have recommended sharing *that* you were casually dating, not the specifics, early on. Why? Because they're gonna have feelings about it at some point and it's probably better to give them time to adjust to those feelings before you *do* meet The One\u2122, so that they don't associate those negative feelings with the person you want them to like and invite into their lives. The divorce rule is really about minor children, yours are adults.", "That's totally fair. I shall change my vote to NTA. Thank you for clarifying.", "Yes, I could definitely use a therapy tune-up.

You are a grown woman who stuck it out through a very difficult situation and obviously loved your husband unconditionally. I think you need to set some boundaries with all involved and remind them that you are a grown woman who is still young and deserves joy, love, compassion and companionship.

It sounds like they all haven't gotten over Tim's death.", "NTA. Man, OP, I\u2019m sorry. It sounds like you loved your husband very much despite his problems and that\u2019s a tragic thing to have to deal with.

More power to you for seeming to have such a level head on your shoulders after all of that.\n\nAll of which being said, you don\u2019t owe your in laws or even your kids any explanation whatsoever. You\u2019re dipping your toes in the water *five years* after the passing of the love of your life and the father of your children.

My ex-husband and I got back together. But why would anyone think that you would remain single? (Unless that is what you want). I think it's easy for some people that have not been widowed to say \"Oh, I'll never date. He's my one and only love\".

You owe them nothing.\nI wish you luck and hope you find love again.", "NTA", "NTA. Your kids are the only ones who may have a somewhat justifiable reason to be upset, only insofar as telling them you\u2019re dating again to avoid this situation. That said, not going to call you an asshole for it and your kids are adult enough that they should be more realistic. \n\nHowever\u2026\n\n>\tAnd I\u2019ll also say that none of these people (meaning the adults in Tim\u2019s family) reached out to see how they could help/support us while he was battling depression and addiction. His parents were regularly upset with me for not doing enough to \u201cfix\u201d him (in their view) and his other family (including the cousin mentioned above) decided they needed to \u201cdetach.\u201d I do appreciate that is a valid choice, however, I think it minimizes what say they should have in how I currently live my life or communicate about it.\n\nThis is complete crap. I would cut your ex in-laws out of your life. They abandoned you emotionally while you and your husband were struggling and now they have the balls to say you\u2019re wrong for dating? Fuck that noise. They are so out of line, they are in another country.", "NTA\n\nThey are reacting poorly. But it is a hard thing to take in. \n\nIf in a week, they haven\u2019t figured this out, it\u2019s time for some hard truths and boundaries.", "The cousin needs a serious talking-to. WTF.\n\nNTA, missus, not at all. Go have fun, you deserve it.", "NTA.  How is it any of their business what you do in your personal life at this point?\n\nAnd \"Betraying your husband\" exactly how?", "NTA. Wow, your family is being super weird about this. Waiting 5 years is plenty, and you shouldn't need to announce to anyone that you're ready to re-enter the dating pool. Seriously.", "NTA. I think it is a good plan not to say anything to anyone unless you were starting to get serious with someone. And Tim\u2019s cousin? WTF? How were you betraying him? Unfortunately he is gone. The vows say til death do us part for a reason.", "Absolutely NTA. Please update us on how you decide to respond to your family- you deserve support, and although I only speak for myself, I'm sure that many other people here want to be able to offer you that, even if just in words, whether it goes well or poorly. \n\nAnd by the way, congratulations on your healing and being willing and able to begin to try and move on. This is a step some widowers never reach, and it's a testament to your tenacity and strength that you've kept yourself and your kids afloat so well in the wake of your husband's passing, and even before that with the issues that plagued him in life. You are a powerful, incredible woman who is deserving of a new chance at love, and I truly hope that your family (especially your children) will be able to see that sooner rather than later.", "I've always hated the term \"moving on\".  What you are doing is living, and you are in the deciding stage of what the term \"living\" will mean to you.  NTA, keep trying to find what will bring you enjoyment in life and don't worry about all the others.", "NTA - wow, you seem like a very thoughtful person and have helped your kids and yourself through the loss of your husband with therapy and time. Maybe your other family members need to do the same and butt out of your business. There\u2019s nothing inappropriate about you dating. It is not their business   and you don\u2019t need to ask them permission.", "Nta. It really is no ones business until you get serious with someone. Just ignore them. Reassure your children.", "NTA\n\nTo be fair, I think you SHOULD if you have young children and actively-involved grandparents. I think a heads-up would be in order in that scenario. But in your case, your children are grown and YOU are likely no longer actively involved with their grandparents.", "If it were Tim, these same people wouldn\u2019t bat an eye if he got re-married in less than a year after you had died. Trust. They would\u2019ve said the kids need a mom, they would\u2019ve said Tim deserves happiness. They definitely would not be complaining about him dating if he stayed single raising your kids solo for five years.\n\nNTA, they don\u2019t deserve to know you\u2019re dating. You don\u2019t need their permission. You\u2019re not a teenager and their response just gives off intrinsic sexism vibes.", "Not her cousin, her late husbands cousin. But yep op is NTA", "Whoever called your kids are the biggest AH! \n\nDo OP\u2019s kids inform OP of all their dates? I understand that they might be surprised and need to adjust but\u2026they will. OP should distance herself from ex-ILs.", "I think the expectation is that I would be too consumed with grief and guilt for the rest of my life to do anything but wail and rend my garments...", ">YTA for not at least letting your kids know.\n\nThe kids *don't* need to know unless OP has started seriously seeing someone. But going on a few dates with someone is not major life news that needs to be reported. Yeah, it'd be nice to get a heads-up, but OP is allowed some privacy in her dating life until it becomes relevant to her kids. \n\n>It is no one else's business, but letting them know would have made this a non-issue.\n\nExcept for all the other ppl in O's life who are upset, you mean? I don't know how the kids knowing about this would have affected the cousin's reaction. \n\n>It also gives them lots of time to slowly adjust to the idea instead of you suddenly telling them you are dating and want them to meet someone.\n\nBut that's not what happened, so why are you comparing these two scenarios? It's not like OP has to introduce her new boyfriend to her kids the second they get serious. She can still give her kids time to adjust to the knowledge of her having a boyfriend before making them meet him. \n\n>I would apologize to your kids as they did deserve to hear it from you, not someone else.\n\nWhy should OP apologize for someone else's behavior, especially when OP's own actions weren't in any way bad?", "Yes, most of the dates were first dates.\n\nOne person I went out with twice, but it was a quick coffee one day and then dinner a couple days later (after which we agreed it wasn't a match) - so still not really worth sharing.\n\nAs for the person I went out with four times, we really liked each other as people but just never developed a romantic spark (we were both hoping it would happen and it didn't). Those dates were over a period of about two weeks, but happened to coincide with when both kids had finals at college at the end of the fall semester. So I definitely wasn't going to say anything emotionally upsetting during their finals period, and by the time they were done with the semester, the connection had ended.\n\nI was actually quite disappointed by that one not working out (he was a very nice person, and I wish I felt more of a spark), and took a break for a couple months before looking for/accepting any more dates.", "Thank you, I really appreciate the advice from someone who has been in my position.\n\nI've been talking a lot with Luke and Beth since they found out, and they are over the worst of their upset (at least so they say), they just hadn't any inclination that I was ready to date as I hadn't said anything at all to that effect while they were still home. Once I explained that I had waited until they were away from home so as not to have a bunch of different men coming in and out of their lives casually, they understood why I did things the way I did, even though they are still getting used to the idea of me dating.", "I was also thinking that telling them I was casually dating might be interpreted as \"running around with different men,\" which would somehow seem disrespectful to their father's memory, more disrespectful by far than having another serious, loving relationship.", "Thank you for sharing your story. I am so sorry for your loss, especially while your kids were teens. \n\nWhile Tim was going through his illness, in his moments of clarity he told me several times that if he couldn't conquer his demons, he hoped that I would eventually be able to move on and find someone else (or at least be open to it). Of course at the time I told him not to think like that, but I think of that now when I start to feel guilty about imagining a life beyond Tim.\n\nI did tell the kids (after my secret was spilled by Tim's cousin and parents) that I have only been on a handful of casual dates and that there are no worthwhile connections to discuss in detail yet.", "Hmm, you're right! I mean, she wasn't wrong, but that would have been pretty embarrassing if she had been. \n\nAnyway, she has always been a bit of a dramatic busybody so it's not too surprising things would turn out like this after she saw me.", "The funny thing is that Tim's parents are involved very little in my life these days, by their choice! They went low-contact with me (perfunctory holiday greetings only) shortly after Tim died because they said having a close relationship with me was too painful. So, that's another reason I didn't think to tell them I was dating - because they actually asked me not to reach out to them except for an emergency because it was too hard to hear from me. And I didn't think going on a handful of casual dates was an emergency. If I were getting remarried, then yes, even on a low-contact basis I would have told them, but not about casual dating...", "Thanks! It's scary at times, and I never wanted to be in this position, but I'm (cautiously) excited for the opportunity to make new connections.\n\nAnd I know Tim would want me to find happiness again, especially after the past decade (his illness plus a long period of grief) has been so difficult.", "I\u2019d probably give the kids a general, \u201cHey, I\u2019m going to try dating again.  I\u2019ll let you know if anything looks like it\u2019s going to go somewhere.\u201d  It would allow them to absorb the idea before you got serious about someone.\n\nThe rest of them can go F off.  They are not entitled to any information at all. NTA", "NTA, it's been 5 years.", "There was a similar post here the other day so I'll comment basically what I did there. It is fully up to you to move on at your own pace and however and with whomever you wish. Your kids and their grandparents also lost someone so it's normal they might be upset at first, but that doesn't mean they get to dictate what you do. \n\nCasual dating is completely normal and you only have an obligation to tell people close to you if something starts to get more serious. It might be tough for your kids to accept at first, but you still get to live your life. There is nothing wrong with you trying to see what's out there and trying to add to your life.", "They are probably really young and think people in their 40s are almost dead \ud83d\ude02", "In which case, I\u2019m sure you know you aren\u2019t an AH. Please don\u2019t allow them to make you feel bad. Your reasoning for not bringing it up are entirely valid and in all likelihood they would have had the same response if you had spoken to them preemptively. \nTake care of yourself and I wish you the best!", "Hey, as long as you're having fun on these dates and being safe. That's all you can hope for!", "I think the kids will be okay.  The rest of them can go pound rocks. One day at a time, that\u2019s all any of us can do.", "So wait, they can\u2019t be bothered to have any involvement in your life, but yet you need their permission to move on?  Wow. \n\nI know Reddit tends to recommend this extremely cheaply, but you may want to think about a permanent break-up with them.", "Yes, I probably should have said something last summer, when Luke was home from college and before Beth left. But at the time I hadn't even downloaded any apps yet so it seemed premature, plus I was worried it would seem like I was looking forward to having them gone so I could date freely.\n\nIn any event, they know now and will have time to get used to the idea before a serious partner enters the picture.", "Just because they are also my children's grandparents, I do want to leave the door open for a continued relationship, and I don't see the need to escalate to something more contentious. Although I don't see that happening anytime soon...", "I think you are a wonderful and compassionate person -not just a mom - based on all your responses. His family, like you said, just wants someone to blame (was the same with my mom all \u201cwoe is (my mom)\u201d until my dad died of alcohol related death and then she was the devil.). They can screw right off.\n\nFor your own kids, they most likely are just upset due to the shock of his family wrongly shoving their noses where they don\u2019t belong and telling your business. They probably always suspected you were dating and now this verifies it and they feel betrayed. But honestly? They are adults. This really has no effect on their day to day (maybe when they come home from school - rare) so you really don\u2019t owe them an answer until you were ready for it. \n\nI promise you they\u2019ll get over it.", "As an adult myself I would be happy for my mother for getting on with her life. It\u2019s been 5 years they can\u2019t expect you to be single forever,I\u2019m hoping after the initial shock wears off they can find a way to be happy for you. You\u2019re definitely nta and you deserve happiness just like everyone else.", "you can do whatever you want.I think your kids want you to be happy especially since a good chunk of your marriage was spent dealing with pretty heavy stuff. I am surprised they are upset. It is very immature of them but I am sure they will come around. Your husband\u2019s cousin, however, deserves a good dose of Karma.\nOP, be happy, stay healthy, NTA", "I don't think there's a set rule to go by. I think it's going to be different for everyone and you just have to do the best you can, which is what it sounds like what you're doing.  I was a kid who lost a parent and personally, I would prefer a heads up that my dad was getting back out there so to speak. I don't want or need a play by play or even that they're going out on specific dates. Just to know that that's where he's at. Not because I'd have a problem with him dating again but because I think it would be really jarring for me to meet someone he was in a serious enough relationship with for us meet when I didn't even know he was dating in the first place.", "I would think it's appropriate to tell kids if there was a good chance they and your date would run into each other at the house. Otherwise, take your time & enjoy", "Right, one of the main reasons I waited until they were both out of the house to start dating again is that I did NOT want to bring a bunch of new men in and out of their lives while they were still actively grieving their father. By waiting, I thought I would be able to explore dating discreetly and at my own pace without subjecting them to all the ups and downs - and then if I did meet someone who was actually going to be a regular part of my life, I could share that. I just didn't count on the coincidence of running into Tim's cousin while on a date, thereby spoiling the chance for discretion...\n\nI suppose the bottom line is that my starting to date probably would have been upsetting - or at least an adjustment - either way. I had the best of intentions here even if I didn't quite get it right.", "The kids are more upset that they found out from someone else rather than from me directly. They have both said since then that it is understandable I would want to date after 5 years, although they need a bit of time to get used to the idea. And thanks for the good wishes!", "That definitely makes sense! I think I did guess wrong regarding whether my kids would have wanted the heads-up about casual dating. All I can do now is apologize, explain, and be more open with them to the extent they want to stay apprised of things.", "Yes, in retrospect I do wish I had gently broached the subject of being ready to start meeting some new people, including dating and potentially finding a new partner. Anyway, now that they know, I can answer all their questions and be more open about what is going on in my day-to-day life.", "I've found it immensely helpful to pick up with my therapist again every time there's a big life shift. Even if I'm not in acute distress about something traumatic, being able to talk to the same person who guided me through those hard times puts my growth into perspective and keeps me from backsliding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA, btw. Your in laws really crossed a line by contacting your children to badmouth you.", "I was in my 20\u2019s at the time this happened and my sister was in college\u2026my mom just has no boundaries. Lol\n\nI think this was always going to be a difficult thing to navigate. Not because you were wrong in how you went about it, but because there\u2019s always going to be an adjustment for the kids. My dad was a wonderful father and we loved him so much; his sudden death was very hard on all of us. So it was always going to be a bit weird that our mom was dating again. And it wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t want to see her happy, it was just weird seeing her with someone other than our dad.\n\nI have a feeling your kids are probably similar. Once the initial shock wears off they\u2019ll come around. You did *nothing wrong*. The fact is, the cousin went nuclear when it wasn\u2019t necessary. And involving the whole family in your dating life was just vile. You did not deserve that.", "You did nothing wrong. As you are saying, maybe it's dating itself that is the issue, rather than not telling them. Maybe it was a lose lose situation.\n\nYour late husband's cousin, however... What an awful human being.", "I get it. I mean the past few years between your husband\u2019s struggles, and his passing, were no picnic for anyone, I am sure. I am glad they want to see you happy. They were obviously raised well :)", "Yes, they will get over the surprise and upset, and I'm sure they just want you to be happy.  And even as adults, it can take an adjustment period to start seeing our parents as 'people' rather than just parents. Best wishes to you on your journey!", "I wish you luck. Most likely, they will eventually calm down, but it may be an uphill battle for a while due to how they found out.", "I can understand the kids being upset, it\u2019s their own issue though.\n\nOP definitely doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything here and she\u2019s handled it fine.", "I meant, their opinion matters more than any of our comments. I'd be curious to know how her kids felt. If they didn't care, the point is moot(to me).  She's obviously an adult and can handle her life as she wants. But I'd say every parent/child relationship is different, so what should be expected is different, even with adult children.", "Yes, the therapist who helped with my individual grief counseling was fantastic. I have seen her for a couple tune-ups since then, but not in the past couple years. We also had a great family therapist, so I could check with the kids to see if they might be amenable to a Zoom session or two so we can all talk through our feelings about my dating again, with professional guidance."]}
