She had to make sure there was nothing raw because my stomach can't handle raw food. I was a bit dissappointed when the local department store didn't have canned tuna (wanted to make my own sandwiches to save a bit more for souvenirs. My hotel was behind the training center) but then I thought who would buy canned tuna when you could buy fresh?", "The budget is reasonable. I was there for two weeks in 2016 and spent around usd2k (flights were expensed to employer and hotel was provided by the training co). My usd2k was for food, return ticket for airport train into Tokyo, taxi from station to hotel+return, 1 weekend wandering around Tokyo, shopping for souvenirs and transportation costs. \n\nMy weekend wandering was just around Harajuku, Shin-Okubu, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Tokyo Palace etc2. Lots of walking, buying and eating. My colleague who attended the training the year before said she spent a fortune at the vending machines because she was just captivated by what it sold. And also kit-kat, she said there were too many flavors for her to settle on. I wasn't confident in going out of Tokyo because of the language barrier. Have you already bought the roaming sim? I rented a wifi toggle but it didn't work so I got a refund (took a week to process) but had to purchase a sim with just data. It took a long time for the salesman to change the settings on my phone because they weren't used to the model+english.\n\nJust remember to have your passport on you so you don't have to pay for tax on your purchases exceeding a certain amount. The cashier will scan your tourist visa at a special register (so efficient) and staple the receipts in your passport.", "Yeah sorry for not clarifying haha", "You might be able to save some money by taking a domestic flight instead of the Shinkansen. Japanese domestic flights can be pretty cheap (I\u2019m seeing around 100-120 USD round trip from Hiroshima to Tokyo) vs $137 USD one way on the Shinkansen. That being said, the bullet train is awesome and worth the experience. Good luck on your trip!", "Not that I saw in Australian dollar and in December :( Most places were $250-$330 for two nights. I ended up booking the one didnt have any fees", "Hotel rooms are not cheap though. And travel by train neither.", "So I have been before back in 2017. My Grandparents offered to take me as part of their inherientence I'd get and overall, I'm very thankful as it was a good time (dont worry, they also offered this to my other siblings). So am aware of some things. But memory is foggy due to the mental health event in 2019. I was underage back then tho so I missed out on the 'solo adult experience'\n\nMy roaming Sim is literally just my current data plan but $5 extra a day to use overseas. It'll connect to Docomo.  So I'll have about 80GB of data and should be able to use hotel Wifi.\n\nYep, its actually a law to carry your passport with you at all times, appreciate the advice. How on earth did you spend 2K USD for food in two weeks?", "Hmm that could be an option, I will look into it!   \n\n\nI heard Peach Airlines is pretty good?", "Ah, I didn't see you are in AUD. That's a lot different than USD which is what I was assuming", "The 2k was for everything excluding flight and hotel, not just for food. I did splurge on dinner one night at a Lebanese restaurant. I think it was around usd50-70 (main+dessert+drink), my most expensive meal there. I bought a lot of souvenirs for my husband, 2 kids, parents+sister, parents in laws, 5 SIL's and niblings. If I had the morning+early afternoon free+allowed to extend my stay I probably would have spent more but I was stuck in classes/sessions+bosses wanted me back quickly.", "Haven\u2019t taken that one, just ANA and JAL. Looks like those might be pricier for round trip than the cheapest option I\u2019m seeing. I haven\u2019t been to Japan since 2019 so grain of salt for sure!", "Ah I misread,   \n\n\nThats my bad. Hope you had a good time", "2 weeks of me time and oceans away from my husband and kids so he had to handle whatever was going on. What do you think lol?"]}
