There is an 8 year old girl across the street who likes to play with my 9 year old son and my 7 year old daughter.She does not like my 3 year old son.\n\nSometimes I let this girl come over and play with my kids and she has been a bit rude. She goes in my fridge without asking, rummages through rooms in my house. She's said things about my 3 year old to both my husband and me like \"I wish (3 year old) was never born so I could play with (7 and 9 year old) alone.\" When I joked with my kids about being the meanest mom ever she chimed in with this bragging tone \" my mom is really nice. She gets me everything I want.\" I've been letting it go because my kids have had a rough time and I just really want them to be happy in our new area.\n\nWe recently started teaching our older kids how to ride bikes. We've got a late start due to unfortunate circumstances in the past and they were still in training wheels. When my husband took them out on Sunday she was constantly harassing him about them having training wheels. He calmly explained we just got a later start. It was so bad they all just went inside. I took them out again on Tuesday and she got on my case about the same thing. I kept saying the same thing my husband did. Eventually this girl comes at me \"hey miss Disarm33, I am only 8 years old and I already know how to ride my bike.\" in that same bragging voice. I firmly stated, without yelling, \"that's good for you but we haven't gotten that point yet.\"\n\nApparently she didn't like that and went crying to mommy. Her mom texted me asking what happened and I told her how her daughter was being pushy and I had to get firm with her to back off a bit. The mom explained that \"she's just a curious 8 year old, but we'll talk about how people come from different backgrounds.\" I was satisfied and thought it was settled. However the next day at the bus stop, I got the cold shoulder. I tried to initiate conversation and say sorry about the misunderstanding. She cut me off \"she's 8 Disarm33 not 40, she doesn't know any better. You apologize to her yourself!\" I said I didn't do anything wrong and it would be nice if (8 year old) would understand some boundaries. I told her the things her daughter has said about my youngest. \"She would never say that, that's a disgusting thing to say.\" I told her I have no reason to make something like that up and that she's said similar things to my husband. She said she didn't believe me because I never brought it up before. I said I didn't think much of it the first few times and didn't want to push my kids' friend away. She told me she had a meeting to go to and walked away.", "created_utc": 1685029062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13rkzla/aita_for_telling_a_pushy_neighborhood_kid_to_back/", "score": 79, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their daughter is 8 and already a bully and they let her get away with it. What she said about your 3 year old is appalling and not okay at all.

Apologies are and admission of wrongdoing, and can have powerful effects on a relationship.\n\nYou have reinforced your neighbors bad parenting choices and assumptions about your interactions with her daughter. You never, ever apologize for doing the right thing.", "NTA. Different backgrounds my behind. I would have told the girl, while your mommy was teaching you to ride a bike, I was teaching them manners. Maybe now since it\u2019s their turn to learn to ride a bike, it\u2019s about time your mom taught you some manners.", "NTA \n\nStay away from her and keep her child away from yours. She will figure out in a few years it wasn\u2019t your kids that was the problem.", "NTA- This is not a relationship you want to foster.  You don't want continuously someone around your children who's going to put down one of their siblings.", "NTA You were so frickin nice. You did not even say anything remotely wrong, rude, or mean in anyway. Me personally I would have told her to go tf home and stop being such a brat", "NTA. Big surprise that kind of behavior comes from a mom with that kind of attitude.\n\nWith that said, it shouldn't be that difficult to correct a child when they're saying nasty things. It's not even disciplining them, it's just telling them the impact their words have. \"That's a mean thing to say and you hurt our feelings. You probably don't like when people say mean things to you\". If she goes crying to mommy over that and mom has her back, then she's a lost cause anyway", "Oh that different background thing was a put down.\n\nThat little girl learned that behavior somewhere and we all know where now.\n\nNTA. I personally wouldn't let that little girl around my kids to poison them with her behavior.", "At the time I just let it go as something stupid kids just say. My kids have said weird awful sounding stuff as well without realizing it. It's when it became a regular occurrence that it bothered me.", "I don't really feel comfortable secretly video recording a kid. I think I am just no longer letting her come over.", "I wouldn't even call them awful. This situation is awkward but in general we've had a lot of positive interactions with them.", "I really should have spoken up sooner. I just get so nervous around other parents and people in general.", "Yeah I definitely made a mistake in letting it go for too long. I try to be lenient with kids and not cause conflict but I really should have nipped this in the bud.", "It was more a series of events that led up to it. The instances with the bikes she just came out uninvited and that's fine because it's the street in front of our houses. But she would repeatedly bothered us non stop about it. The remark in itself wouldn't have bothered me if she hadn't been on our back the entire time we've been out there.", "I'm not trying to force her to play with my three year old but I am usually the only adult watching them and when they're outside or in the basement I can't be everywhere supervising at once. I can totally get her frustration at having a three year old who wants to do everything his older siblings do constantly trying to tag along. I do let her and my older kids know they can play up in their rooms to be alone but the common areas are up for grabs. It's not like I can lock him in his room lol.", "Just a thought. \u2026\u2026. I had a niece the same age as my daughter that acted very similar. Her mother would not listen. In the end my own daughter put her in her place. Told her \u2018 no use acting like that at my house. My parents won\u2019t tolerate it!! . The funny thing is, it actually worked. My niece pulled her head in!! Good luck", "Then ask for the mother's permission to record her misbehaving. The mother presumably would want to know if she's acting that way to others.", "Probably but tbh this isn\u2019t a big deal. It\u2019s just sensitive subject matter. I don\u2019t think you *are* an asshole.", "I am the same way. It definitely takes some courage to initiate the boundary setting conversation or to tell a parent about their kids bad behavior.\n\nBut those are way better on your conscience than yelling or being rude to a rude kid.", "Oh ok. I do see what you mean and why it\u2019s hard not to have that happen. I think the neighbour girl\u2019s discomfort is valid but of course none of the rest of her behaviour is.", "She definitely has a spoiled streak in her and she acts one way around the adults in the neighborhood who think she's a little angel. I don't think she ever gets told no. But when she's here with us, she's different. She'll play with other little kids but only girls. She told my husband she doesn't like my youngest because he's a boy. My oldest son is also getting tired of her antics. It's just a bummer because I had been getting along with her parents. They seemed like nice people and I have absolutely no friends here.", "It's really difficult and awkward. I had another interaction with a parent in my old neighborhood that was awful. His kids and some other older boys in the neighborhood who were \"friends\" with my son took my daughter to the end of the street and were physically forcing her to kiss the boys when I went inside briefly to change my youngest's diapers. I told the dad about it and he ended up screaming at me and saying that that's just what boys do. The other kid's mom said my daughter wanted it because she was always tagging along with the boys. She was 4 at the time and just wanted friends. Then they told everyone to stay away from my kids and it really sucked. I think that situation and my general social anxiety made me want to avoid the situation altogether again.\n\nI also didn't think what I said was that bad and the time. I didn't raise my voice or anything, but my tone wasn't very nice.", "If she feels discomfort playing with a 3 year old then she doesn't need to play with OP's kids or be in their home. It's his home, not hers.", "Ugh, that is a horrible situation exacerbated by horrible parents and the crappy response you got. Imagine blaming a 4yo for the behavior of other kids? \n\nSorry you had to go through that.", "They aren\u2019t a package deal. They\u2019re independent people. She should play with the ones her age as most kids do.", "If she feels discomfort that a three year old wants to play with his siblings in his own home she can go somewhere else. It isn't OP's problem, and the girl can find some other friends.", "Well it\u2019s not the girl\u2019s fault that it\u2019s the case so why should she have to miss out? It\u2019s also not the older siblings\u2019 fault. So why should they miss out on a friend (if the neighbour girl was better behaved ofc). It would be OP\u2019s problem if their older children were continually losing friendships due to their younger child.", "> why should she have to miss out? \n\nBecause she can't control who a three year old plays with in his own home, it's very simple. He has every right to play with his siblings in his own home regardless of her presence or feelings about it. \n\nIf she feels discomfort that's up to her and her parents to handle, but she can't control what actual members of that household do as much as she may want to due to how spoiled she is.  If it were an issue the older siblings could have gone to her house. \n\nMost 8 year olds aren't as twisted as that girl and don't mind three year olds, so I don't see how they would be losing other friendships. It looks like the siblings are better off not being friends with her."]}
