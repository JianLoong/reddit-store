They seemed like nice people and I have absolutely no friends here.", "It's really difficult and awkward. I had another interaction with a parent in my old neighborhood that was awful. His kids and some other older boys in the neighborhood who were \"friends\" with my son took my daughter to the end of the street and were physically forcing her to kiss the boys when I went inside briefly to change my youngest's diapers. I told the dad about it and he ended up screaming at me and saying that that's just what boys do. The other kid's mom said my daughter wanted it because she was always tagging along with the boys. She was 4 at the time and just wanted friends. Then they told everyone to stay away from my kids and it really sucked.

It would be OP\u2019s problem if their older children were continually losing friendships due to their younger child.", "> why should she have to miss out? \n\nBecause she can't control who a three year old plays with in his own home, it's very simple. He has every right to play with his siblings in his own home regardless of her presence or feelings about it. Why should he be locked away in his room just because of a random girl? OP should have put a stop to her presence in her home much sooner. \n\nIf she feels discomfort that's up to her and her parents to handle, but she can't control what actual members of that household do as much as she may want to due to how spoiled she is.  If it were an issue the older siblings could have gone to her house. \n\nMost 8 year olds aren't as twisted as that girl and don't mind three year olds, so I don't see how they would be losing other friendships.

At the same time - look, girl, if you can't be nice to my family, you can't hang out with my family, that includes the 3yo. And from then on, as soon as she says something negative, tell her goodbye and make her leave. I know that's easier to do inside than outside, though. Outside just ignore her. If she's in your yard or driveway, tell her to leave. But when she realizes she's not getting to say what she wants or get a reaction from you, she'll most likely move on.", "Whoa there. I am obviously open to being called an asshole since I asked but don't come in here saying I'm not a good parent. Have you ever been around kids? They say stuff. Growing up I had a best friend and her brother was my brother's best friend. We'd get in tiffs between us and our brothers from time to time. It's true I should have done something sooner, but don't put my parenting into question.", "Nah. I was having trouble figuring out how to word the title. I never actually said \"back off.\" I just said what I mentioned in my post just in that firm \"this is final\" mom voice.

Kids know when they're being picked on, even if its by proxy.", "There are schools of thought that think children only playing in similarly aged groups is socially limiting and can reduce empathy for younger children.

OP can encourage the three year old to be playing something different. Obviously locking him in his room isn\u2019t actually an option. But there\u2019s different places you can go before you arrive at that extreme. \n\nAlso you don\u2019t seem to be taking the older siblings into account here. Your assuming that they want to play with the the three year old for some reason. I mean clearly they want to play with the neighbour girl because otherwise the neighbour girl wouldn\u2019t still be coming round would she? \n\nYou say he has every right to play with them regardless of how the girl feels. However, not regardless of how his older siblings feel. The siblings want to play with the girl, the girl wants to play with the siblings. Therefore why are you acting like the girl is intruding on the playing between the siblings and three year old? The three year old is the outlier here, not the girl.\n\nYes most 8 year olds won\u2019t be quite so adverse and will accept the three year old for a while. but ultimately they\u2019re all going to be more familiar with playing with a bunch of 8 year olds and that stark age gap is still there. So it will make for some points of contention sooner or later.", "Why should someone control it? The neighbour girl needs to stay in her own home if she's uncomfortable at OP's, that's her problem and nobody else's. \n\nUnlike you I've read OP's comments, and the older son doesn't like the girl either, so the only person making assumptions is you. If the daughter is the only person who wants to play with the 8 year old they can play in her house or in her room. You're making assumptions to validate the daughter's cruelty, and it isn't working. It's not OP's job to endorse a random girl's irrational hatred of her toddler. \n\nThe girl is the outlier, because it isn't her home. If they don't want to play with the three year old (and there's no evidence of this whereas there is evidence that the older boy doesn't like her) they need to play with her either in their rooms or outside of the home - her disgusting comments make this even more of a necessity. A twisted girl like that doesn't need to be around the three year old anyway. \n\nNo it won't, and this is the only time this has happened according to OP. He won't be a three year old forever, and if it's an issue with other kids at this time they could go to their rooms. The toddler has a right to the common living areas at any time.\n\nThank god OP isn't letting the girl come over anymore.", "Hell no bro. Next time, throw him in a trashcan \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.

Obviously most 8 year olds probably don't want to play with a 3 year old, but her words scream future mean girl.", "Are the kids expected to play with the 3 year old? The  neighbor's comments make it sound that way and it's not really surprising that 7-9 year olds aren't interested in playing with a toddler. \n\nIf so, I am going ESH. This girl's behavior sucks but the OP seems to have some unreasonable expectations.", "I don't expect them to play with him and I can totally understand the frustration of having him butt into their activities.

He's at that age where he likes to do everything his big siblings do and I am not about to keep him out of the common areas of our house.", "I have been in education for nearly 17 years, K-12. Even if the children were expected to play with/humor the 3-year-old, it is not typical for an 8-year-old to say they wish their friend's sibling had never been born.  That's a bit more than having poor boundaries. \n\nIn many cultures, it's also not an unreasonable expectation for older children to include younger children. In most cultures, it's also not unreasonable to  expect a school-aged child not  to tell adults(in their own home)they wish their child hadn't been born.", "Honestly that\u2019s probably a waste of time. I think even w video evidence the girls mom is going to say something along the lines of the video being taken out of context or the child being coerced into saying nasty things. Kids learn behaviors from somewhere, and at that age it\u2019s likely she learned to act that way from immediate family."]}
