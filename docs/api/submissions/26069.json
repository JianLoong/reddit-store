I could be the asshole in this situation because he is my family no matter what, and I should forgive him because he is still a child and we will always be family.

I would encourage you to seek out therapy though so you can get help with the ptsd and self harm (and not so you can \u201cforgive\u201d your cousin)", "NTA.  The asshole is the cousin that denied what he did, and called you a liar.", "NTA. You do not have to forgive him, especially as he has denied everything. Sexual assault is still assault. It doesn\u2019t have to be rape to have a huge impact on you. Family huh? He betrayed the family when he assaulted you!\n\nYou were very brave to speak up. Your mum should be supportive and not force you to be around your attacker on your birthday or any other time.", "You wanna know the worst part? Your aunt KNOWs you are not lying. She knows what your cousin does and it is not the only time he did it.\n\nShe is also terrified that you will go to the police. She wants to bully you not to do it.\n\nYou should go to the police. Trust me. They have experts there who will know who is a liar, because in rape cases, there is almost never any actual evidence - but the stories. And if your story is reported, I am almost certain that one day, someone else will report the same person and then a pattern will be established. A pattern is almost as good as the proof.\n\nAnd also, if you report him, you are fighting for the next victim. He may rape or maybe already did another 10-year-old who is too scared to talk and is suffering in silence, cutting themselves.", "NTA - try to make peace with your experience. For your own sake.\n\nBUT you are under no obligation whatsoever to be kind or even cordial to him. Your mom is wrong. And it sounds like there is a terrible history of SA in your family. Unhealthy cycles tend to repeat themselves. \n\nAll the best", "NTA. He violated you, and just because it was penatrative doesn't make it less bad. Also, he never apologized,  never even admitted to it. He hurt you, lied about it, and is allowed you to be treated badly by your aunt. He is not a good person, he has proved that time and again, so even if you were to forgive him (I wouldn't, but that's just me) that won't make the unease go away. Forgiveness is not forgetting, and you shouldn't forget, that's how it becomes a generational problem.", "NTA, not a single bit. You do not have to forgive and move on because of some DNA connection. Trust me on that. I am also a survivor of the same and MUCH MORE!!! If you know what I mean, also by a cousin. He and I are absolutely no contact. You have the right to be angry. Personally,  I did eventually forgive my cousin, not for him, for myself. But I am still no contact,  I still will not be around him, I still keep tabs on where he is so I won't be there. Your family who knows what was done and encouraging you to be around him are toxic. You have the right to set boundaries, you have the right to feel safe, you have the right to speak up and say NO!!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
