I said I wanted my entire family to be there. If anyone wanted \"separate celebrations\" we could just not celebrate, because it was my big day and I'm sick of that shit. Everyone agreed and promised to be nice to each other.\n\nAt the party things were going really well at first. Everyone was having fun. Then my stepfather started giving my stepmother a bunch on unsolicited advice about her daughter and her daughter's autism. My stepsister was also right there and could hear what he was saying. My dad told my stepfather to walk away, but he kept insisting he knew what he's talking about because he's \"a teacher.\" It eventually devolved into a screaming match where my stepmother called him a worthless piece of shit and he called her a psychotic cunt.\n\nThe party was ruined. I got my grandparents to kick my stepfather out, but the mood was ruined, and my dad's side of the family quickly found excuses to leave, so I pulled the plug on the party. Each time my stepfather has tried to talk to me since then I've said \"what's up, guy who ruined my graduation party?\" This really upsets him.\n\nHe said it's not fair to blame him, because my stepmother acted just as poorly. I said it is fair, and I absolutely blame him. He asked how long I would blame him for and keep throwing the party in his face. I said maybe forever. He said I was too old to be acting like such a little asshole.\n\nMy mom asked me to be the bigger person and let sleeping dogs lie, but I'm not ready to do that.

I said I wanted my entire family to be there. If anyone wanted \"separate celebrations\" we could just not celebrate, because it was my big day and I'm sick of that shit. Everyone agreed and promised to be nice to each other.\n\nAt the party things were going really well at first. Everyone was having fun. Then my stepfather started giving my stepmother a bunch on unsolicited advice about her daughter and her daughter's autism. My stepsister was also right there and could hear what he was saying. My dad told my stepfather to walk away, but he kept insisting he knew what he's talking about because he's \"a teacher.\" It eventually devolved into a screaming match where my stepmother called him a worthless piece of shit and he called her a psychotic cunt.\n\nThe party was ruined. I got my grandparents to kick my stepfather out, but the mood was ruined, and my dad's side of the family quickly found excuses to leave, so I pulled the plug on the party. Each time my stepfather has tried to talk to me since then I've said \"what's up, guy who ruined my graduation party?\" This really upsets him.\n\nHe said it's not fair to blame him, because my stepmother acted just as poorly. I said it is fair, and I absolutely blame him. He asked how long I would blame him for and keep throwing the party in his face. I said maybe forever. He said I was too old to be acting like such a little asshole.\n\nMy mom asked me to be the bigger person and let sleeping dogs lie, but I'm not ready to do that. These dogs are very much awake and pissed off. Am I the asshole for that?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The poster who may or may not be edible didn't say she was sick of all men and their inability to admit fault. She said she was specifically sick of men who are unable to admit fault. So if you're not such a man, her statement doesn't apply to you, and there is no reason to be offended.\n\nBut what do I know?

In fact she should treat him with distant politeness, when she has to, and else not even think about it. Some interaction will be unavoidable, being her stepdad, and likely wanting a good relationship with her mother. The guy misbehaved gravely, sure, but not that bad, that she should be so strongheaded that it would jeopardize the relationship with her mom. Family is always a complex dynamic, and you cant just hamfist your way through everyone, even if you are in the right. It may break ties with more members from your family than you want.

Hell the man hasn't even apologized to OP for his behavior. \n\nWhy on earth would you ever let someone stomp on your boundaries and act like an ass? Letting it go when the perpetrator is unrepentant would just signal that they could keep getting away with that behavior.\n\nAll OP is doing is giving them a constant reminder about what he did. If stepfather wants it to end then he should be the bigger person and start apologizing and trying to make up for his behavior. \n\nIt is never on the wronged person to make amends.", "I can't necessarily see that she is acting like a child so much as holding him accountable...
