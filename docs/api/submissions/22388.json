I said I wanted my entire family to be there. If anyone wanted \"separate celebrations\" we could just not celebrate, because it was my big day and I'm sick of that shit. Everyone agreed and promised to be nice to each other.\n\nAt the party things were going really well at first. Everyone was having fun. Then my stepfather started giving my stepmother a bunch on unsolicited advice about her daughter and her daughter's autism. My stepsister was also right there and could hear what he was saying. My dad told my stepfather to walk away, but he kept insisting he knew what he's talking about because he's \"a teacher.\" It eventually devolved into a screaming match where my stepmother called him a worthless piece of shit and he called her a psychotic cunt.\n\nThe party was ruined. I got my grandparents to kick my stepfather out, but the mood was ruined, and my dad's side of the family quickly found excuses to leave, so I pulled the plug on the party. Each time my stepfather has tried to talk to me since then I've said \"what's up, guy who ruined my graduation party?\" This really upsets him.\n\nHe said it's not fair to blame him, because my stepmother acted just as poorly. I said it is fair, and I absolutely blame him. He asked how long I would blame him for and keep throwing the party in his face. I said maybe forever. He said I was too old to be acting like such a little asshole.\n\nMy mom asked me to be the bigger person and let sleeping dogs lie, but I'm not ready to do that.

I said I wanted my entire family to be there. If anyone wanted \"separate celebrations\" we could just not celebrate, because it was my big day and I'm sick of that shit. Everyone agreed and promised to be nice to each other.\n\nAt the party things were going really well at first. Everyone was having fun. Then my stepfather started giving my stepmother a bunch on unsolicited advice about her daughter and her daughter's autism. My stepsister was also right there and could hear what he was saying. My dad told my stepfather to walk away, but he kept insisting he knew what he's talking about because he's \"a teacher.\" It eventually devolved into a screaming match where my stepmother called him a worthless piece of shit and he called her a psychotic cunt.\n\nThe party was ruined. I got my grandparents to kick my stepfather out, but the mood was ruined, and my dad's side of the family quickly found excuses to leave, so I pulled the plug on the party. Each time my stepfather has tried to talk to me since then I've said \"what's up, guy who ruined my graduation party?\" This really upsets him.\n\nHe said it's not fair to blame him, because my stepmother acted just as poorly. I said it is fair, and I absolutely blame him. He asked how long I would blame him for and keep throwing the party in his face. I said maybe forever. He said I was too old to be acting like such a little asshole.\n\nMy mom asked me to be the bigger person and let sleeping dogs lie, but I'm not ready to do that. These dogs are very much awake and pissed off. Am I the asshole for that?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We live with autism 24-7 and we have a PHD in our children.  I have always partnered with teachers to help them know what reaches my children.  I have never had a teacher tell me I am doing something wrong when it comes to my kids.  Had they, it would have come to blows.  \n\nIf it were me, the next time he asks you not to call him his new title, I would tell him that he needs to deliver a contrite apology to your stepmother, step sister, grandparents who hosted.  He needs to contact every guest and take full responsibility for making your milestone celebration that you will never get back about his inflated sense of qualifications as an autism specialist, which he is not.  Lastly, he needs to offer you his action plan on how he will never again make one of your milestones about him.

Of course this depends on one's view of family. I think a lot of people with dysfunctional family have cut them off, perhaps in a manner that's totally justified, and that results in a lot of people on AITA giving advice that basically amounts to throwing relationships permanently out the window as this is normal within the confines of their own experience. But the number of family dynamics are legion, and in many cases an infuriating family member isn't someone who necessarily can or should be cut off and so we need to step up.
