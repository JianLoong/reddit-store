My sister's boyfriend started asking if he could propose to my sister at my wedding. I obviously said no, because that's OUR day only. He can propose the day after my wedding, but not on my wedding. But he asked me again, and again. I said no everytime. The 50th time when he asked me i said, not only can't he propose at my wedding, but he can't even come to my wedding. Then my sister started to fight over this. She knew her boyfriend wanted to propose to her at my wedding. I said to her, that's gonna be my day and my husbands only. She started to call me names because i banned her boyfriend from my wedding. She said that if im not gonna let him propose to her then she's gonna ruin my wedding dress. She even said that she's gonna sneak her boyfriend because she wanted to all the family members be present on her proposal. I said thats fine, she's also banned from my wedding now. \n\n\nA few days later some family members called me to say im a heartless person, because i broke my sisters heart. They said she cried because she wanted to be on my wedding, she wanted to see her little sister getting married. They also said that i should have just accepted her wish and let her boyfriend propose at my wedding.\n\n\nSo reddit, tell me, AITA?", "created_utc": 1698348956, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h4m88/aita_for_banning_my_sister_and_her_boyfriend_from/", "score": 3953, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister an FBIL, however, are two matching pieces of work.  She's going to wreck your wedding dress if you don't let her BF come propose at your wedding?  Wow.\n\nI would suggest that you hire security to make sure your sister and her BF cannot attend.  Her instability could truly wreck your wedding, particularly if she tries to make good on her threats to sneak in BF and wreck your dress.\n\nAs for her heart being broken, ignore.  It's just drama from a woman who just really, really, really wants to upstage you at your wedding.\n\nDo not include her.  Do not include her BF.  \n\nShare with your family:  In writing.  \"Please stop contacting me about sister and FBIL not being invited to my wedding.  BIL asked me many times if he could propose to sister there, and I told him no as the wedding is to celebrate the bride and groom, and should not be hijacked by another event.  After many requests, he still refused to take no for an answer, so I asked him not to come.  Sister then said that she would come, wreck my wedding dress, sneak her BF in, and have her proposal.  She also called me A, B, &C.  For these reasons sister and FBIL will not be coming to my wedding.  I am not open to further discussion on this topic. Best, OP\"", "Did you tell your relatives that she threatened to ruin your wedding dress?  She sounds as if she's struggling with some major mental health issues-- what normal person would say that? \n\nI was at a wedding right before Covid hit and apparently the MOH and bridesmaid found out during the rehearsal dinner that the groom's brother was going to stage an elaborate proposal at the wedding.  MOH wasn't having it LOL and went out an bought a couple of dozen cans of silly string which she handed out to all of the niblings to \"play a funny trick\" on \"uncle\".  She told them when she said \"geranamo\" they were all to come up to where every uncle and gf were and spray them both with the silly string.  \n\nShe enlisted the dj -- who told her he had a special routine for just such occasions and so when UNCLE asked for a \"special\" song he told him one more song and he'd do it so UNCLE and gf came to the front middle of the dance floor and as the song started all of the kids and wedding party charged them with silly string flying and DJ blasting \"Who Let the Dogs Out\" at top volume. \n\nThe guests and even bride and groom were blissfully ignorant of what was going on as UNCLE was apparently a notorious prankster -- though my husband said he saw the girl friend crying when she ran out of the ballroom and wondered what happened. \n\nIt's sad to have to ban your own sister from your wedding but she really isn't leaving you any choice here.  \n\nI've seen other people faced with your dilemma who went premptive and made several CONGRATULATIONS posts on social media to the offender as if the the proposal already happened and they were already engaged.

If you are calling about the situation with my sister and her BF, here is all I will say: My sister and boyfriend have been uninvited to my wedding for the following reasons.  Boyfriend asked if he could propose to my sister, I said no as its my day.  He proceeded to ask me so many times that I realized he would do it regardless, so he was banned.

It's totally feasible to propose in front of all of them. The fact that she's trying to do it on your day is uncool. The fact that she's insisting (after you said no) is downright rude.

My sister's boyfriend started asking if he could propose to my sister at my wedding. I obviously said no, because that's OUR day only. He can propose the day after my wedding, but not on my wedding. But he asked me again, and again. I said no everytime. The 50th time when he asked me i said, not only can't he propose at my wedding, but he can't even come to my wedding. Then my sister started to fight over this. She knew her boyfriend wanted to propose to her at my wedding. I said to her, that's gonna be my day and my husbands only. She started to call me names because i banned her boyfriend from my wedding. She said that if im not gonna let him propose to her then she's gonna ruin my wedding dress. She even said that she's gonna sneak her boyfriend because she wanted to all the family members be present on her proposal. I said thats fine, she's also banned from my wedding now. \n\n\nA few days later some family members called me to say im a heartless person, because i broke my sisters heart. They said she cried because she wanted to be on my wedding, she wanted to see her little sister getting married. They also said that i should have just accepted her wish and let her boyfriend propose at my wedding.\n\n\nSo reddit, tell me, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Snore is *notorious* for peeing on people, especially after he knocks them down. He's an excitable big dumb puppy. So, she brought him in, let him off leash, acted like he got spooked and ran away from her. He jumped on MIL and peed all over her chest and stomach \ud83e\udd23 like MoH was trying to traumatize this woman for all the shitty behaviors she pulled during mine and hubs relationship because time of the wedding wasn't the beginning. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nEdit: snore got to MIL when she was trying to walk up behind me with a whole BOTTLE of red wine and a bowl of sugar with coconut shavings (I'm anaphylaxis level allergic to coconut)", "Sister has malicious intent when she did not get her way, better go NC with them", "OMG I would be so embarrassed. How did other guests react??", "From Wikipedia \"(UK, Ireland, Commonwealth, Hong Kong, idiomatic) An unappealing mixture; a disorderly situation; a mess.\" And now added to my lexicon.", "And being enabled in doing so because she's the loudest and whiniest.", "What the actual fuck?!? Anaphylatic level allergic and she brought it to you? That could be considered attempted murder...at least felony assault.", "In Australia we use the expression \u201ca dog\u2019s breakfast\u201d which has the same meaning.", "That's why my MoHs entire goal was to traumatize her, not just make her mad.", "'But, but, she didn't know.  She thought OP was faking it.  It was a joke...'  /s", "Where I live in the US we just call it a shit show!", "Your story was some of the best petty revenge I've ever read! Good for your MOH, and good for you!", "Nobody even attempted that since the first time I was ever hospitalized from anaphylaxis from coconut was at her house. \ud83e\udd23 she would have definitely tried otherwise.", "I learned 2 very important lessons that day: \n\n1. Never tell my bestie to traumatize someone. They have absolutely *no* chill/conscience.\n\n2. Give bestie limits. Cause they have none."]}
