We were at the same table and ended up talking quite a bit through the reception, we were vibing and ended up getting each others info. After talking for a week or two then Jet asked me if I'd like to get dinner and drinks sometime. I suggested a couple places I usually go on first dates (sushi bar/tacos) but Jet said he wanted to treat me and recommended a local Italian joint. I checked their menu and let him know that I wasn't seeing a lot of options I could have (I have celiacs) and he ended up choosing a different Italian place with more GF options. So far we're doing alright.\n\nDuring the date, I tried to pay for my food since the entree was a little pricier than his (about $5) but he insisted on paying. I tried multiple times to say \"no, that's okay, I'd like to pay for mine\" but each time he brushed me off and told me he was paying. The bill ended up being slightly over $100 including drinks, apps, and tip.\n\nOn the way back to my place, there was a dessert shop I wanted to stop by. Jet said he probably wasn't going to get anything but changed his mind while I was at the register. He then proceeded to order a $20 sundae flight, tell me that it was my turn to pay, and get offended when I told him that I had already paid for mine and wasn't going to get my card out again for his. He told me that it was a way to pay me back for dinner. I tried to pay for myself at the restaurant and was reassured multiple times that he was fine with paying. I brought this up and said that I'm not paying. Period.\n\nI was talking to my roommate about this after the date and was told that I wasn't being fair since he paid significantly more than he was expecting me to. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686765394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149efur/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_dates_ice_cream/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

WTAF lazy BS is that?", "YTA  \nNo, you don't have to pay, but the way you went about it makes you an asshole. He paid for your $52 meal and you refused to pay for his $20 dessert because you were too lazy to pull your card out a second time? Honestly?

That makes no sense at all.", "YTA, you had a chance to be kind, you missed it.", "YTA. You insisted on paying for your meal, which I get. But it was a place he picked and he offered to pay for your drinks and your dinner. That's dating etiquette.  It was your idea to stop for dessert, you picked the place, you should've graciously paid for his ice cream. Again, dating etiquette. Instead you told him in no uncertain terms he wasn't worth the hassle to reach into your wallet and pull out your credit card which would've taken, what? One minute? Two?

But I suspect you already know that.", "ESH.\n\nI think you could have offered to pay for the ice cream. When my husband and I first started dating, this is something we would do.

Simply saying, \"since you paid for dinner, can I pay for your ice cream?\" would have been the polite thing to do. \n\nI don't like his attitude of insisting you should \"pay him back\". Paying for dinner was entirely his choice and almost demanding something in return is what makes him an asshole too.", "YTA. Or at the very least, you two aren\u2019t compatible. He just spent $50 on your half of the dinner and you can\u2019t spend $20 on his dessert?? That\u2019s just weird. I wouldn\u2019t even call it stingy. Just odd behavior.

It's a nice gesture to offer to pay for yourself like many folks do when someone offers to pay the whole tab. But, you making the excuse of not getting your card out again is just wack. How difficult is it for you to go in your wallet/purse?  Be kind. He definitely didn't need to point out again that he treated you since that was the plan all along. But you being extra resistant to paying for a sundae just seems rude and stingy. YTA.", "YTA...he spent 100 bucks on you ice cream was not a big deal to pay for.", "NTA", "YTA.

The ice cream is obviously a lot cheaper.  Seems like you didn't really want to pay for half of the dinner, and you knew that he would insist on paying, so you were just pretending to want to pay.

Regardless of having paid for dinner or not, you suggested a place he's never been to. So he has no idea what is available. You asked to pay outside and inside a couple times. How long did he have to really take in what was available? Sounds like he said no, because he didn't know he would find something he'd like. And since you offered a few times, I too would assume that offer is still on the table. When he finally sees something he wants, I too would assume the offer was still on the table. And would be taken aback when it finally came to you, you totally went back on your word. That actually says more about you than him. And you didn't want to pay because you already put your card away which is a bit of a lame excuse.\n\nI don't think money is the issue here for you or him. It feels like you rescinded an offer when it came down to it. And that's probably what he was reacting to.\n\nI'm going to say soft YTA.

Of course but I personally just don\u2019t understand the logic of not wanting to get him something after he bought you dinner especially when you were prepared to pay half of dinner which was more expensive and you suggested the ice cream. If someone buys me something, I automatically want to get them something back.\n\nEdit to add: a lot of people on here seem to think he was testing your boundaries don\u2019t personally get that but without even thinking of that I would have presumed maybe he saw what the ice cream looked like or honestly I\u2019d struggle to make up my mind sometimes I would of gave someone the benefit of the doubt and wanted to pay.", "YTA You offered 3 times and then took it back when he accepted. What kind of fucked up mindgames are you playing?", "ESH. What he did sounds like a stupid test, the kind that relationship gurus recommend.\n\nStill, paying 20 bucks and calling it even would have been fair. And then you chould have dumped him for playing stupid games with a free conscience. That's worth 20 bucks.", "Honestly Opie I think you really dodged a bullet, and forget what your friend said this is so fair because he wanted to treat you even though you said you could pay by yourself so let it be. But you have no power over what he orders so he doesn't have a right to ask you to pay for his ice cream. NTA", "Exactly, he only insisted on paying for dinner so he could see whether or not he could cash in on that favor later. Manipulative shit, right there. This whole situation would have been different if OP had offered to pay for ice cream initially, but he didn't want any so - 2 people pushing each other's buttons over a dinner bill on a first date is a suit of red flags", "Exactly this. He is already trying to dictate when and where you spend your own money *on the first date*. You weren't allowed to pay for your dinner despite trying to insist, and then you were pressured to pay for his dessert when he refused to let you pay for yourself already. Reciprocity applies when both people are equal participants in the interaction. That's not what your date was trying to create here.", "We were walking.

He watched her complete her transaction for her ice cream, put her card away and THEN ASKED. Is that common courtesy to you?

Not because of the $20, but because they are just not fun.  \n\nIf the final take away from a date is thinking about the bill (rather than the person), it must not have been a very good date.", "First rejection was outside the shop when I asked if it was cool with him to stop in for some dessert. He said \"I'll come in with you and you can get something but I don't really want anything\". I asked him if he was sure he didn't want anything twice. He rejected both chances to order something. \"No, I'm sure- I'm good\" both times. We were in the shop for probably 10 minutes before I paid for mine.", "This just in no one said that.  However if you say no 3 times maybe HINT that you're going to be saying yes a 4th time instead of immediately assuming she's the asshole for taking his 3 nos as nos. Maybe understand that she's a normal human who took 3 nos in a 10 minute span as Nos?", "She has updated in the comments and again has said within 10 minutes she asked him 3 times and he said no all 3 times. \nPeople who still think she's an asshole are the ones who think women will say no to sex 3 times and the 4th no means yes. \n\nHer comments are near the top and easily findable and readable \n\nShe's NTA", "Yes she has updated in the comments and in fact offered 3 times once outside the store and twice inside within a 10 MINUTE time frame \nPeople who are saying she's an asshole after 3 tries are the dudes who think a girl's no 3 times to have sex is just a 4th yes waiting to happens. It's gross", "But she's not an asshole. He definitely is though. \nAnd people who think she's still an asshole after 3 tries are the ones who think 3 nos means an eventual yes in other areas as well.", "I think he probably offered because she suggested a cheaper place than he intended to go for their first date. And if someone suggests tacos, you might not want to stick them with a $50 bill for their share of the dinner you want to go to. I don't think this is an outdated thing necessarily, it's just good manners to offer to pay if you're the one that wants the fancy thing. \n\nAnd it would be good manners for her to offer to pay for the dessert (which she suggested stopping for) as he walked her home. Which it almost sounds like she did. She says she asked if he minded if they stop for an ice cream. He said that he didn't want anything but was happy to come in and wait while she got something. She told him that she was definitely paying for herself this time. She then asked him another two times if he was sure he didn't want anything. She ordered and paid, then got her order and he said that he did like the look of something after all. If I were him, I'd have taken those repeated questions about wanting an ice cream to be an offer.  She has said that she would have paid had he said yes any of the times she asked.

He did not want anything, then becomes a glutton?", "That still really sounds a lot like you're offering to buy him an ice cream. Asking twice \"are you sure you don't want anything?\" sounds like an offer. \n\nAnd it sounds like you only retracted that offer because he didn't order at the same time as you. He saw something he wanted after you had already ordered. I would probably, like him, have assumed that the offer was still good while inside the shop.", "What did your ice cream cost?", "In the later comments, maybe, but she hasn't edited the original. And no, saying no and assuming it means yes is not at all what happened here. She claims she wanted to pay for her meal. He, after being incredibly wishy washy about his decision to have dessert, ended up getting one. He thought she would pay since he paid for dinner. She isn't the asshole for saying no. She has every right to say no. She's the asshole because her reason for saying no was that she wasn't going to take out her card again. That's just being ridiculous. Now, if somewhere in the other comments she has stated that this comment is false, then she should update the original comment so that people don't have to comb the other comments for more information.", "Didn\u2019t see the update, that\u2019s bananas", "You are reading an awful lot into an ice cream sundae. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I would definitely pay for someone\u2019s sundae after they bought me dinner that I expected to pay for myself. It\u2019s not exactly onerous to bring out your cc twice. But whatever, you do you. \n\nThese two should definitely not see each other again unless they enjoy arguing over money.", "Ya he could have and should have asked her if the offer still stood. It would have taken him 3 seconds like it took her 3 times to ask. She asked him 3 times. After 3 times it means no right? How many times do you need to be asked before you give an actual answer. \nAfter 3 nos I'm gonna go ahead and assume the answer is no \n\n1 \nNo \n2 \nNo \n3 \nNo \n4 yes you're an asshole if you don't? \n\nWtf?", "He rejected the implied offer 3x, twice while standing inside the shop over the course of the 10 minutes we were there. I was actively trying to leave the shop when he decided to order. I'm not sure how this is seen as me continuing to offer.", "$7 including tax and tip", "Let's not forget she offered to pay for dinner several times as well and he denied her so he shouldn't have expected anything back either since he denied her ability to pay for dinner. \nAnd again he's the asshole for blowing up on her because he's embarrassed he couldn't make up his mind \nSounds like he doesn't need anymore sugar to the brain  it sounds like she dodged a bullet and will find a man who knows how to make up his mind. \n\nBest practice? \nLet everyone pay for their meal or whoever invites the other person out. \n\nAnd don't dictate what someone spends their money on. \nSounds like he's wishy washy everywhere he goes. \n\n\nSuper turn off for a lot of women! Next!", "Not shocking to see men blaming her though. A lot of them think no means yes if you push enough.", "I definitely would have asked if the offer still stood if it was me. But I also don't think he's the AH for not deciding that he wanted something until after she asked. Or for thinking that she was buying, after all the offers. \n\n>After 3 times it means no right? How many times do you need to be asked before you give an actual answer. After 3 nos I'm gonna go ahead and assume the answer is no \n\nI really don't think he wanted anything until he saw something he wanted. So no was his actual answer until he saw something he wanted. I don't think he was trying to trick her. What the Hell would be the point? She was offering to get the ice cream, he didn't think he wanted any, then he saw something he wanted and said \"actually I do want something after all\". I don't see why he's the AH here.", ">I'm not sure how this is seen as me continuing to offer.\n\nBecause you offered 3 times! Why would planning to leave be seen as retracting the offer?", "Yeah that\u2019s a dick move to get a $20 ice cream. He went from no thanks to what\u2019s the most expensive thing on the menu.", "That's all great and well but he doesn't get to blow up at her and get pissy when she accepts his no 3 times. \n\nPeople who thinks she's the asshole after 3 times are the ones who think a woman's 3rd no to having sex means the 4th no means yes. \n3 times is more than enough. And at the end of the day he had no right to act like a dick to her after the fact she dodged a bullet for sure", "How is it not?! How is *leaving* a shop not simultaneously closing the offer? You're transaction is done... you're leaving the premises. That is the exact time to *check* (if you're going to). Not assume, that despite you're insistence of no, that the offer stands on the way *out* of the store.", "Because he rejected all 3 offers and waited to order until I was walking towards the door.", ">People who thinks she's the asshole after 3 times are the ones who think a woman's 3rd no to having sex means the 4th no means yes.\n\nWhat the?!?! Seriously? Who thinks she's an AH for offering to buy something 3 times? I saw people saying he was an AH for saying no to her contributing to dinner 3 times, but didn't see anyone argue that she was an AH for offering to pay either time. \n\nAnd what does that last sentence have to do with this conversation at all? She asked three times, he said no three times. Then he said \"actually yes\" without her asking again. She can retract her offer, but it sure makes her look petty. I think she comes off like the dick.", "And then he took you up on the offer, because he finally saw something that tempted him.", "She updated her edit in the comments and has said she asked him 3 times within the span of the 10 minutes they were in the shop and he declined her offer all of the 3 times. A guy responded to her by saying \"well who says they can't change their mind she's TA\" \nalso her update is near the top and can be read. \n3 times is enough. After 3 times I'm gonna go ahead and assume you can't make up your mind \n\nAlso she offered to pay for her dinner and yet he declined multiple times \n\nSir use your voice \n....he has no right to blow up on her after she has ensured his Nos many times in both situations"]}
