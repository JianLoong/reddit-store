This was an important conversation to have with the bartender and this was not acceptable behavior on her part. It was between multiple other men who could have touched her drink; she also doesn\u2019t know how well you two know each other. It could\u2019ve been a first date and it\u2019s not something you take lightly. Getting your drink spiked is no laughing matter. She should have simply waited till your fianc\u00e9 arrived. I don\u2019t understand the point of opening a drink and leaving it at different places around a bar. I\u2019m glad you stood up for your fianc\u00e9 and didn\u2019t stay silent", "really depends on your tone. you can be right and still be an asshole about it.", "Its the law in my state that drinks have to be opened prior to being served, so y t a for that part, because every bar I\u2019ve gone to in a bunch of states have that policy/law. NTA though for the bartender being careless with the drink. As far as bringing it to the table while she\u2019s gone? Bartender is doing her job by serving the drink to the table that ordered it. It\u2019s your gf\u2019s responsibility to watch it from there. Obviously she trusts you, but say on first date you either go to the bathroom, then order, or order, wait for your drink, and take it with you. It\u2019s horseshit, but women have to be vigilant about their own safety. To reiterate, what makes you NTA is the bartender setting it down by randos and not replacing it. That\u2019s the only problem with what the bartender did here.", "YTA Bartenders have to open drinks because people walk out with them and most places (95%) don't have off-site licenses. Your fiance ordered a drink, and then she left. You're her fiance, I assume you're not going to GBH her drink so what's the fucking problem? Yeah YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: NTA. I totally misread what you wrote about the drink being by some dudes. Yeah NTA that's bad bartending and totally irresponsible. You should call the bar and ask to speak to the manager/owner and tell them the issue and how you were treated. Apologies.", "YTA. Just because you would have done it differently doesn\u2019t mean they did it wrong. If your girlfriend didn\u2019t want her drink to come while she was in the bathroom she shouldn\u2019t have ordered then gone to the bathroom. I think they were right to throw you out.", "YTA So, you were watching the drink the entire time, and demanded a new one?  You could/should have spoken to right away. Instead, you create a scene.", "Wtf ????? NTA\nAt all,why on earth would she open a can?????? A bottle beer totally fine since not everyone carries an opener but a CAN ?????? Creepy af", "NTA. I was drugged a few months ago, and I was AT the bar when it happened. I turned to talk to a friend for like 5 seconds. That's ALL IT TAKES.", "As a bartender and a waitress you HAVE to open a bottle or can infront of the customer because some customers get sketched out if you don't.\n\nNta", "NTA - I worked as a server/bartender at a cocktail place ant that was considered a fire able offence of done repeatedly or maliciously. Repeatedly means like three times in a three month period:\n\nThey also make a nail polish that acts like a roofie strip and changes colour when you get any tainted drink on them, so if you are really concerned about this risk the. You can use that polish. It\u2019s available on Amazon I think.", "NTA. My sister was drugged at a bar and made it home safe cause her friends were observant and called our mom to pick her up.", "In the age of drink spiking and date rape, you can have a harsh tone when carelessness which can lead to endangerment occurs. \n\nDoesn't make you an arsehole if the tone is for the right reasons.", "The bartender *didn\u2019t* give the drink to OP. She opened it, put it in the middle of a group of entirely different men, and forgot about it until they asked whose drink it was. Then she brought it over to OP.", "I mean she could have put it down in front of them in the first place, or waited for OPs fiance to come back from the bathroom", "You are missing the point. People can easily spike a drink. It is a rule that if you are a bartender or waiter you HAVE to open a bottle or can infront of the customer. If you are mixing a drink its fine but when it's just the can and bottle it has to be opened infront of the customer.\n\nI know cause I am a waitress/Bartender.", "It obviously isn\u2019t a problem that it\u2019s with OP but it was a problem that she as just leaving an open drink around while the person that was supposed to be drinking with didn\u2019t even receive or see the drink for minutes as it was getting passed around the bar lol", "Where did OP say they were watching the drink the entire time? All I see is \u201cten feet away for several minutes\u201d.", "harsh sure, condescending no, and the question about \"common practices\" makes me wonder if they were a condescending dick about it instead of just asking for a new drink and giving them the benefit of the doubt that it was mistake.", "Oh, I misread that. Yeah NTA. I'll fix it.", ">Where did OP say they were watching the drink the entire time? All I see is \u201cten feet away for several minutes\u201d.\n\nOP could only know it was ten feet away for several minutes if they were looking at it.  \nThey could have said straight away to bring the drink", "but she never admitted it was a mistake AND threw them out?", "In what world do you see a drink being served at someone elses table and insist its yours?", ">someone elses table \n\nNowhere say it was at someone else's table. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The bartender/server had opened the drink and set it down on a counter away about ten feet away from us", "Still probably assumed it was for someone else."]}
