Sadly, as I understand it, the law isn\u2019t actually about safety but more about preventing customers from taking beverages to go.

The country this took place in/the nationality of the bartender could explain this though, local liquor laws change a lot from place to place. I used to be a bartender and here in Australia, I legally would not be able to leave the drink unopened as it would be considered a takeaway sale which falls under a separate category of liquor licence. I'd be risking a huge personal fine and putting the bar's liquor licence at risk.

Once the drink is made/opened it should be delivered immediately. \n\nThe issue wasn\u2019t that your gf was in the washroom - the bartender had no awareness of that if you were at a table and not at the bar.

Also, it doesn\u2019t take that long to use a bathroom, maybe ask what takes so long.. munchies, go smoke some trees no biggie IMO.. but the way your post is kinda makes it seem more like bathroom breaks that usually mean some nose candy may be part of the time needed to \u201cuse the bathroom\u201d.

OP knows he and his friend won't tamper with the drink, but the bartender does not.\n\nAll that said, since OP was watching the drink pretty much the whole time, I think they're making a bit of a fuss over nothing, and I feel that the reaction of the bartender was due to OP's overly confrontational/aggressive approach, and OP would have served their own purpose far better by having a quiet word later\n\nOP really just wanted to show how much they knew about bartending.", "I don't see how these things contradict each other?", "I'm sure I can find smaller words for you.", "I am sure it will fill your life with meaning to finally have something worthwhile to do that also allows you to use your full competences."]}
