This was an important conversation to have with the bartender and this was not acceptable behavior on her part. It was between multiple other men who could have touched her drink; she also doesn\u2019t know how well you two know each other. It could\u2019ve been a first date and it\u2019s not something you take lightly. Getting your drink spiked is no laughing matter. She should have simply waited till your fianc\u00e9 arrived. I don\u2019t understand the point of opening a drink and leaving it at different places around a bar. I\u2019m glad you stood up for your fianc\u00e9 and didn\u2019t stay silent", "really depends on your tone. you can be right and still be an asshole about it.", "Its the law in my state that drinks have to be opened prior to being served, so y t a for that part, because every bar I\u2019ve gone to in a bunch of states have that policy/law. NTA though for the bartender being careless with the drink. As far as bringing it to the table while she\u2019s gone? Bartender is doing her job by serving the drink to the table that ordered it. It\u2019s your gf\u2019s responsibility to watch it from there. Obviously she trusts you, but say on first date you either go to the bathroom, then order, or order, wait for your drink, and take it with you. It\u2019s horseshit, but women have to be vigilant about their own safety. To reiterate, what makes you NTA is the bartender setting it down by randos and not replacing it. That\u2019s the only problem with what the bartender did here.", "YTA Bartenders have to open drinks because people walk out with them and most places (95%) don't have off-site licenses. Your fiance ordered a drink, and then she left. You're her fiance, I assume you're not going to GBH her drink so what's the fucking problem? Yeah YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: NTA. I totally misread what you wrote about the drink being by some dudes. Yeah NTA that's bad bartending and totally irresponsible. You should call the bar and ask to speak to the manager/owner and tell them the issue and how you were treated. Apologies.", "YTA. Just because you would have done it differently doesn\u2019t mean they did it wrong. If your girlfriend didn\u2019t want her drink to come while she was in the bathroom she shouldn\u2019t have ordered then gone to the bathroom. I think they were right to throw you out.", "YTA So, you were watching the drink the entire time, and demanded a new one?  You could/should have spoken to right away. Instead, you create a scene.", "Wtf ????? NTA\nAt all,why on earth would she open a can?????? A bottle beer totally fine since not everyone carries an opener but a CAN ?????? Creepy af", "NTA. I was drugged a few months ago, and I was AT the bar when it happened. I turned to talk to a friend for like 5 seconds.

Repeatedly means like three times in a three month period:\n\nThey also make a nail polish that acts like a roofie strip and changes colour when you get any tainted drink on them, so if you are really concerned about this risk the. You can use that polish. It\u2019s available on Amazon I think.", "NTA.

People can easily spike a drink. It is a rule that if you are a bartender or waiter you HAVE to open a bottle or can infront of the customer. If you are mixing a drink its fine but when it's just the can and bottle it has to be opened infront of the customer.\n\nI know cause I am a waitress/Bartender.", "It obviously isn\u2019t a problem that it\u2019s with OP but it was a problem that she as just leaving an open drink around while the person that was supposed to be drinking with didn\u2019t even receive or see the drink for minutes as it was getting passed around the bar lol", "Where did OP say they were watching the drink the entire time? All I see is \u201cten feet away for several minutes\u201d.", "harsh sure, condescending no, and the question about \"common practices\" makes me wonder if they were a condescending dick about it instead of just asking for a new drink and giving them the benefit of the doubt that it was mistake.", "Oh, I misread that. Yeah NTA. I'll fix it.", ">Where did OP say they were watching the drink the entire time?

ESH, you watched the bartender put your fianc\u00e9\u2019s drink down so you don\u2019t pick it up? You don\u2019t let your fianc\u00e9 know her drink is ready because she\u2019s clearly not staying in one place? Like come on, I\u2019m sure the bartender had better things to do than chase her up and down the bar. Y\u2019all came in together so of course the bartender might assume you\u2019d keep an eye out (which in all fairness is wrong). It sounds like you wanted to be difficult for the sake of it. But the bartender is definitely in the wrong for taking the bait and lack of professionalism", "NTA he may have spiked it himself", "Fianc\u00e9 or fianc\u00e9e?", "Yta weirdo", "no, not even a little bit.  you did good and you were protecting your fiance from any potential harm, you did what was right", "NTA drink spiking is real.

NAH.", "\nI do think it\u2019s strange that he was arguing to replace it when she wasn\u2019t even back from the restroom yet. Like, given his argument, why would the bartender replace *her* drink by giving a new one to *him* while she isn\u2019t there?\n\nETA: in my state (NY), the bartender has to open the bottle/can before serving. So I was thinking the bartender would just be handing him another opened can of beer while she wasn\u2019t there. Not sure what state the OP is in or what the law is there..", "My first thought too. I have had friends get their drinks spiked by blokes who had got the bartender to do something similar. \n\nThey didn't realise the women had a bunch of big blokes rocking up a little after and we saw them go from sober to messy drunk in a very short time. It was their second drink. One of the women wasn't drinking and saw the bartender take the drinks to another table first, then to theirs.\n\nSecurity cameras saw it all and they were arrested and it ended up with lawsuits. My friends walked away with a chunk of money to keep quiet and keep it out of the courts. \n\nIt was just lucky one of the women was a police prosecutor and had a fair few friends in the local station. Otherwise it probably would have been swept under the rug.", "the bartender is definitely in the wrong for taking the bait and lack of professionalism", "People who do this deserve to be locked up forever.", "Opening prior to being served doesn't mean sitting unattended in between a bunch of customers for several minutes.", "Were they at a table?

He was like \u201cno. You aren\u2019t. I\u2019m coming to you, where are you\u201d. And he did. Thankfully.   \n\n\nNext day friend and I counted back our money. Nope\u2026 we\u2019d had only two drinks over about three hours and two locations (we moved bars after the first drink and it was incredibly not like us at all to do ANY of this). Had to have been the bartender because we were drinking beers in bottles we didn\u2019t put down. I\u2019ve seen this same friend drink multiple bottles of wine several nights a week\u2026 both of us could hold our booze, so a 1.4 standard drink beer shouldn\u2019t have floored either of us.", ">My friend and I exchanged glances, thinking why she would leave the preopened drink there and **then with us.** I\u2019ve worked as a bartender and **would never leave a girl\u2019s drink open while she was away**\n\nThe issue was *also* that it was left opened with him. He wanted it *unopened,* which was where I was confused, and so, apparently, are you.", "Ah, I forgot he assumed the bartender can serve it unopened. I\u2019m not sure what state he\u2019s in, but in NY state, the bartender must open bottles or cans by law. So in my bar, it would just be another opened can of beer with the same potential problem for her.", "Not my fault you're incapable of properly expressing your point, I understood the op fine, it was you that's confusing. \n\nYou seemed confused about the situation in general, not with one specific part of the situation.\n\nLeaving an unattended drink among a group of randoms is objectively less safe than leaving it with people you know.\n\nSo opening it in and leaving it with the op does solve half the problem.", "True.   but at least in front of the correct customers.", "Nope, just the opened vs unopened part.", "Agreed. Sadly, as I understand it, the law isn\u2019t actually about safety but more about preventing customers from taking beverages to go. But it\u2019s definitely best practice to open in front of customers whenever possible (sometimes it\u2019s not possible like when opening drinks for servers to bring to a table, etc).", "No, you were definitely confused about leaving it with strangers too.\n\n>why would the bartender replace her drink by giving a new one to him while she isn\u2019t there?\n\nBecause it's a twofold issue. One issue, it being left among strangers, is solved by leaving it with the op instead.\n\nAgain, I don't understand your confusion.\n\nYou don't seem to understand leaving the drink with the op solves one of those issues."]}
