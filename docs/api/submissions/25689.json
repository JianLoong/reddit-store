Sadly, as I understand it, the law isn\u2019t actually about safety but more about preventing customers from taking beverages to go.

The country this took place in/the nationality of the bartender could explain this though, local liquor laws change a lot from place to place. I used to be a bartender and here in Australia, I legally would not be able to leave the drink unopened as it would be considered a takeaway sale which falls under a separate category of liquor licence. I'd be risking a huge personal fine and putting the bar's liquor licence at risk.

Once the drink is made/opened it should be delivered immediately. \n\nThe issue wasn\u2019t that your gf was in the washroom - the bartender had no awareness of that if you were at a table and not at the bar.

Also, it doesn\u2019t take that long to use a bathroom, maybe ask what takes so long.. munchies, go smoke some trees no biggie IMO.. but the way your post is kinda makes it seem more like bathroom breaks that usually mean some nose candy may be part of the time needed to \u201cuse the bathroom\u201d.

OP said bartender set it on the counter, where other customers potentially had access to it. Not \u201cthey gave it to other people at the bar\u201d.

The bartender would most likely have served DIRECTLY to her had she not walked away? Once she realised fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t going to come and pick up the drink bartender moved it, though the best thing would have been to initially just serve it to OP since the fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t there. \n\nHowever, like I said, to save all of this OP should have just went to collect the drink. I don\u2019t know why everyone is trying to convince me that\u2019s sooo hard and that he didn\u2019t know it was his fianc\u00e9s drink, if it wasn\u2019t what would he have lost? Waiting a few extra minutes? He clearly knew it was anyways lol. Instead he waited for the opportunity to cause an argument which eventually lead to them being thrown out. Was that really worth it?"]}
