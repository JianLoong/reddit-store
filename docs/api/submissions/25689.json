The country this took place in/the nationality of the bartender could explain this though, local liquor laws change a lot from place to place.

Also, it doesn\u2019t take that long to use a bathroom, maybe ask what takes so long.. munchies, go smoke some trees no biggie IMO.. but the way your post is kinda makes it seem more like bathroom breaks that usually mean some nose candy may be part of the time needed to \u201cuse the bathroom\u201d.

I've never seen someone thrown out who didn't *really* cross the line. In these subs we're only ever hearing half of the story, and I'm not prone to automatically believe the person who got thrown out of a bar.   \n\n\nThe question the OP asked of the bartender *is* condescending. Instead of asking if it's \"customary\", they could have just said that they're not really comfortable with that drink, knowing that it had been within reach of men he didn't know. The way that they phrased that complaint was very douchey.  \n\n\nAlso, the OP would have us believe that he's been a bartender. But, he can't tell the difference between a server and a bartender? Also, I would think that pretty much any bartender should know that in most states it's illegal to serve an unopened beer. That is unless the bar holds an off-premises liscence, which is incredibly rare, but hey, OP has bartended before, so he knows this, right?  \n\n\nThis post is fishy.

Drinks can be opened tableside or behind the bar, and then brought straight to guests. It should never be on another table opened, and if it is, it goes back to the bar to be thrown away. You were completely right to ask for a new drink and \u00e9ven \u00edf  you weren't right (you were, but still), they still should've brought you a new drink. I've replaced drinks for way more idiotic reasons.", "NTA. Not only was she a bartender, she was a woman. So she had to know this is not okay.

Leaving it with people she was with is weird", "NTA. You should ALWAYS err on the side of caution when drinking at a bar. A while back my parents were at a bar and my mom ordered a drink. She got up to use the bathroom and I suppose my dad was not paying attention. When she came back she decided she didn\u2019t want her drink and gave it to my dad, who only had one drink prior, definitely not enough to get drunk.

I was at a company Christmas party with my wife, and we had reserved a private room for the event. We all ate and had some drinks and made stupid toasts and what not. Small company, maybe 20 of us there in total. All the ladies decided to go down to the bar area because they wanted to sing and chat and me and the boys were having a bromance. I came down stairs 10 minutes later and find my wife completely fucking thrashed. I was slightly buzzed, but I knew she had planned to drive us home, and had said she might have a glass of wine with dinner and maybe a cocktail after. \nI asked my friend Cathy, who was sitting next to her at the bar, what she had. A Moscow mule. 1. \n I ended up driving us home and she has no recollection of that night after we finished the dinner. \n Pretty sure it was the fuckin bartender that spiked her drink.", "ESH.

Why would they take someone's concern for their wellbeing personally? Sounds fishy to me.", "NTA\nI\u2019m a bartender and I would never do this.

I have to eat that.", "Dude. Who cares. Read the room. I think you sound like an ass. You\u2019re weirdly aware of everything happening. Sure this is probably fake.

You guys got away safe but another woman might not.", "It could also be possible that this bartender was in on it herself. \nLike why would you do that(leave other people\u2019s drinks in front of random costumers), first of all, and second, why did she get furious and started acting mean and rolling her eyes? \nIf anything she should have been more understanding, being a woman herself, and not made a fuss over it, because drink tempering happens so often.", "NTA and she has the nerve to roll her eyes\u2026", "Most bartenders will replace a drink for pretty much any reason, even if you just don't like it. Pretty weird that she wouldn't. It's not her money.", "How could they have known the beer in the bar was intended for their table? At a restaurant do you often go rocking up to the bar and take random drinks off of it? Even a man at the bar thought it was his according to op.

So you\u2019re point about rocking up is redundant. Bartender probably didn\u2019t know where the fianc\u00e9 was given she walked away (the most silly thing imo) so they just placed the drink down, though this is based on the assumption she ordered on her own and why I need more context. OP saw her food and drink get served but didn\u2019t say anything until the last minute, and then we\u2019re thrown out presumably after management were informed?

You do not leave an opened drink out where it can be tampered with. If you think for any reason it is unsafe or tampered with, replace it rather than get sued, fined, and have the establishment shut down over someone getting sick or injured. \n\nThe math being the drink is $2 to $5 tax deductable, being fined for incorrect or illegal service of alcohol is $10,000 minimum with no tax exemptions. \n\nThe OP is absolutely right and has valid concerns. \n\nIt, in fact, does seem very strange that the server became angry about it rather than quickly apologise and get a new sealed drink to open in front of her when she gets back. \n\nParticularly since they should legally have certified training before being allowed to serve alcohol commercially.
