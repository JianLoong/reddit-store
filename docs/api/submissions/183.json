{"id": 183, "submission_id": "yhd8ta", "title": "AITA for humiliating MIL at a family dinner when she wouldn't stop going on about grandchildren?", "selftext": "Please don't post this elsewhere (aka tiktok, YouTube).\n\nI (27f) haven't gotten along with my MIL for the better part of my relationship with my partner (27m). She has said a lot of mean things about me that are honestly just childish and cruel (I won't get into the he said she said stuff). I've become exhausted with her, especially as I've moved into my career, moved town and am in the process of getting married/ buying a house. In the past few years shes taken to outright ignoring me, speaking over me, pretending i dont exist. As a result, I've mentally checked out from trying to make things working with her and in part so has my partner. Let me make it clear, I support whatever relationship he wants to have with her, but I'm done trying to be her friend. \n\nWe were at a family dinner party (my partner asked me to come along) recently where she started asking him about when he's having children. She kept pestering him and asking when she's getting grand babies and that she wants children around. This has been something shes been harping on a lot about lately and its getting on my nerves. My partner asked her to stop several times but she kept bringing it up. I was sat there silent for a bit, but I think the wine got the best of me so I kinda snapped. I turned to her and started asking what she wants to know about our *private* life?? What kind of protection we're using, what positions we've tried, what toys we use. I started to list them all. Lets just say I used very inappropriate language for a dinner table, even throwing in a \"do you have any pointers for me, or maybe it'd be best if you just came and watched to make sure we're doing it right\". At this point she was yelling at me, having a go at my partner for \"letting\" me speak to her like that and crying about how mean I am. We got up shortly after and left.  \n\nMy partner thinks I took it a bit far in front of his family, and his aunties have said it was wildly uncalled for and mean. I don't really feel bad for it though, should I?\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I'm infertile. She isn't aware of this, I'd never give her that info to weaponise against me. But just for the people commenting to keep kids away from her, I won't have any to keep away from her but thank you for the advice. I know your hearts in the right place.  My partner has told her several times we won't be having children and to drop it. Since my partner always wanted children, she's assumed that I simply don't want children and am taking that away from him.\n\nUPDATE: \nThank you all for the replies! I appreciate the people giving some reasoning behind YTA and ESH. I normally go to my friends about these things but I worry it's maybe a bit of an echo chamber, they're so supportive and might not call me out on my BS. I can say I've read most, if not all the replies, and I still don't feel that bad about what I said (sorry YTA and ESH people!). \n\nMIL has since messaged my partner, I won't put the exact wording. But she has said that she \"knows\" I'm the cause of her not having grandchildren and she's disappointed in him for being with me. She also said how grandchildren are a basic right, and even if they are half carrot_sloth89's children, she would still find it in her heart to love them and shape them into good people. \n\nMy partner blocked her after that. I know a few people suggested I just tell her I'm infertile, but the way she weaponises information is honestly terrifying. Some other people said that my partner should say he is infertile, and I think that's a valid option, but for now he wants no contact. \n\nSome people have suggested adoption. Thank you, I know it's coming from a good place, I just want to wait a while before considering children. I don't want to bring in a child that will likely have considerable trauma themselves into a house where I haven't fully healed. It's not fair on them. I'd also never want them to think they're filling a void just because we couldn't have children naturally, that's a heavy burden to place on a tiny person. I also think I'd like to do some pre-adoption therapy (if that's a thing lol) for a year or maybe even some classes to better educate myself on how best to adopt and raise an adopted child. I'm not about continuing any cycles of abuse here. Also, if we do adopt MIL won't meet them. I'd hate for her to say anything nasty or hurtful because they aren't \"blood related\".\n\nThanks everyone!", "created_utc": 1667133376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhd8ta/aita_for_humiliating_mil_at_a_family_dinner_when/", "score": 7323, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her not knowing about it does not make your reproduction her business but she shouldn\u2019t assume it will always be easy for everybody to produce kids even if that\u2019s what they want to do.\n\nThere were lots of ways to shut that conversation down that were less brutal to the rest of the family (example: \u201cif you want babies around so much, have you considered being a foster parent?\u201d Or even \u201cif we had kids I wouldn\u2019t want them being around somebody who can\u2019t show good manners and stop prying\u201d) but you don\u2019t really owe her that consideration.

It is so gross an inappropriate to act like women are walking incubators for giving relatives grandbabies. \n\nYou managed to reclaim power and control of the situation and turned it back around on her.\n\nYou also tried to get her to stop nicely and she didn't care. You're not wrong to stand up for yourself.", "NTA! Until your partner puts up strong boundaries you're going to deal with this for the rest of your relationship though, so that is the ultimate issue.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy don't you go no contact with your AH MIL, and let you husband go to events where he is without you? THat would surely improve the quality of your life.", "NTA. She was being rude and inappropriate, so you dished it back. Love it!", "NTA. I'm also infertile and boy are people like your mother in law exhausting. To a level I'm not sure people who haven't been in that situation might appreciate. It's enough with all the internalised guilt about not being able to live up to the same norms, standards and ideals as other women but then to have shame pilled on from the outside too.... Perhaps it would have been easier to just tell your MIL as a couple that you're (you plural) infertile and asked her to respect your privacy by not asking any more questions. I rather get the feeling she wouldn't respect it though.\n\nYou're certainly NTA. Sending lots of solidarity.", "I understand your frustration. I probably would have gone with, \"discussing our intimate relations during a family dinner seems inappropriate to me, as does your unusual interest in your own son's sex life.

You may have been a little extreme but I guarantee she\u2019ll think twice before asking again!\n\nETA: She was probably banking on the fact that there were other people around so you wouldn\u2019t call her out. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA - please teach me your ways o masterful one.", "NTA.\n\nYour partner may have said he thinks you went too far, but he didn't stop you either. I wouldn't make a habit of this, but the only way to stop bullies is to beat them at their own game. No shame in doing so when the situation calls for it; hopefully next time, she keeps her nose out of your business.", "NTA but I would have probably gone in a different direction.. \" Why do you keep going on about giving you grandchildren? You treat me like shit or simply pretend I do not exist and are plain rude. You realise if we gave you any grandchildren they wouldn't be all your son, they would be half me. Why would I want to have kids for you to treat me like shit in front of them or decide they're too much like me and decide to treat them poorly too? We aren't having children, as you are aware. END of conversation and I won't discuss it again.\"", "Nta. All I am going to add is in regards to your edit, grand children are not a 'basic right', grand parents having a relationship with their grand children is a privilege on the condition that they aren't toxic, narcissistic assholes to the children or the parents. \n\nMy partner is also infertile and my mother pulled the same shit, I lied to her and said I had a vasectomy before I met my partner (been together for 5 years) and have no plans to reverse it, that was after she tried to make my SO feel like shit and bullied her for it because both of my brothers are popping out children in their early 20s and always struggle financially due to that decision.\n\nShe was upset that I 'did not consult her' I pretty much said my body, my decision and it had nothing to do with her. She and my father both take swipes at me over it regularly, but now completely leaves my SO alone which is great and was my plan because my SO doesn't need that shit, although right now we are both more focused on careers.\n\nI haven't gone NC with my mother but I do limit my contact with her quite a bit. My childhood was very traumatic, even if we do have children there's no way even as a last resort will my parents have unsupervised visitation", "NTA.\n\nToo far? A little.\n\nJustified? Definitely. \n\nAre you absolutely brilliant? Hell yes! It may have been a bit far, but oh it gave me a good laugh \ud83d\ude05 Well done \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA. I know some people will be critical of you but you have dealt with awful provocation and harassment over a period of time. Even though your partner asked her to stop several times she continued - and he's the one she actually talks to. She acted as if you weren't there, as if your partner would be able to produce children without any involvement from you. She sounds horrible and I don't know what else people think you could have done, other than just walking out without a word and never going back. She was humiliating you but now wants to present herself as a victim. NTA", "NTA, I personally wouldn\u2019t have taken it that far. But man would I love to have been a fly on that wall.", "NTA, after reading your edit I feel really angry on your behalf, it must be awful having someone as her as MIL.", "NTA, when are people going to understand that it's no one's business if/when people are going to have kids. It's such an insensitive topic to force someone to talk about.  So sorry you have to listen to that. I honestly would have boiled over too.", "NTA. Yeah you could have taken a softer approach, but it looks like you already tried that.  Hopefullythis gets her to mind her own business.", "NTA. Everyone always expects the person being bullied to have no reaction or else they are in the wrong too. Getting angry is normal she crossed a boundary way to long ago.\n\nYour reaction to her is completly valid, she sounds exausting.", "Nta. I\u2019m surprised your partner allows this.", "NTA, sometimes it takes that much to make someone shut up. My MIL kept harping on something until I stood up and hit the table, knocking stuff over, and then telling her how it was. I never went in her house again. Good for you!", "NTA. Why does your husband let his mom treat you this way?", "NTA. I'm so tired of parents trying to harass their kids into having children that they may not be able to have, or can't take care of, or don't want, I honestly don't care how people respond after asking them to stop multiple times.", "NTA because you tried to be reasonable and it didn't work. So now it was either suffer or dish out.\n\nAnd I do not think it's appropriate to ask people to suffer absolutely inconsiderate and rude behaviour just to spare rude people's feelings.\n\nSo after she was repeatedly told to cut it and it's definitely inconsiderate and rude to harp on and on after that you just did what you had to do to stop her.\n\nShe had all the control here. She could have stopped at any time, but she went on and on and on despite being told to stop repeatedly. So in this case, she brought it onto herself.", "NTA - she was wildly inappropriate for going on about it. She got a taste of her own medicine in humiliation.", "She kept pushing for intimate details about your sex life at a family dinner in spite of being asked to stop multiple times, so you gave her details. But because they weren't the details she wanted, suddenly talking about your sex life at dinner is inappropriate. Beggars can't be choosers. NTA", "NTA\n\nShe's just mad because you described the acts necessary to fulfill her fantasy. She brought it up first, you took it to its natural conclusion. Your partner really needs to step up here, though, and have a REAL talk (without mentioning your private medical info or difficulties) about how HE feels about having kids and your future. And then enact consequences when she brings it up again, EVERY SINGLE TIME afterwards.\n\nWhat you did is called \"consequences\", especially since she's been told numerous times to stop it and hadn't. Publicly embarrassing her **the way she'd been** ***constantly doing to you by bringing up your empty uterus in public constantly*** (whether it is empty by choice or not, your personal organs are not dinner conversation talk any more than your sex positions are) is really the least of what she deserves.", "NTA, but I would just stay away from her.  If she's there, be absent.  If your husband wants to be there, good for him.  Keep your distance from the drama. I would apologize to the aunties for any inappropriate discussions and that you didn't mean to offend ***them***.", "NTA.\n\nYou may have been over the top, but sometimes that's what it takes to get the point across.

Your MIL is obviously the A here, but I don\u2019t think you realize that your hubby-to-be is too. If he\u2019s try to shut his mom down, but she won\u2019t stop, there needs to be consequences. He\u2019s literally letting her treat you this way. It will happen for the rest of her life. Do you really want that?", "NTA. People that harass about having children infuriate me. We are child free by choice and happy. Thankfully both of our parents are supportive but if not, I would do the same as you.  This will teach her not to stick her nose where it does not belong.", "NTA", "NTA. Everyone has limits and she exceeded yours.

Did you take it a bit far? Sure did, but it was worth it, wasn't it? Well done.  NTA", "Omg, your mil sounds a lot like mine. I went NC with her years ago. Best thing I ever did. \n\nNTA. Maybe a tad overboard.... but I can't say I wouldn't have done the same thing. \n\nWe do not owe our parents grandchildren. None of her business. Your SO told her to drop it... they laid out the boundary right there and she kept going...", "NTA\n\nIf your partner doesn't like the way you shut his mother down,  he should have shut her down himself.    He apparently didn't take it far enough since she continued, so you had to take it farther.", "Folks, based on the last edit, please be very careful about suggesting adoption or foster care to people you do not know. \n\nPeople that are infertile know their options. \n\nAdoption is not a secret. Not everyone can, nor wants to, adopt. Fostering is even more involved. \n\nI **100%** trust that y'all mean well and are trying to be supportive and generous, but please, \"You can always adopt\" is a platitude we've heard a million times.", "NTA.  Okay, maybe you were a bit over the top, but you were not completely wrong.\n\nYour MIL is toxic.  Your partner seems to be doing a decent job of *trying* to keep MIL off your neck.", "NTA. If she was harping on and wouldn\u2019t stop when asked and has done the same on the past, then embarrassing her was the only way to end it. If you\u2019d have walked out she still would have done it the next time only adding in how rude you were (in her mind) for walking out. If your partner didn\u2019t like it then he should have taken her aside and told her to quit it if she ever wants to have a relationship with any potential grandchildren because at the rate she\u2019s going, you\u2019re likely to say no to children completely or if you do, make a point to not let her be involved. My aunt did that to her daughter in law and she told my aunt that the closest thing to a grandchild she was going to get was their dog. It\u2019s been 20+ years & they\u2019ve stuck to it.", "She has been told, repeatedly, to shut up.\nShe did not.\nShe therefore deserved this. Frankly, you were mild (but, Dutch too) so, well done.\nShe will not try this again.\n\nNTA", "NTA it took a rather large fight after my MIL asked if my husband ND I were sexually active to get her to stop about grand kids as a woman who chose not to have any kids herself to.  We stopped speaking for six months over it.", "Hahahaha!!!!!!! That\u2019s awesome!!!!\n\nIf she didn\u2019t stop harping on it after your partner told to stop, and you then took it to the point  where she *did* stop, then I\u2019d submit that by definition, you *didn\u2019t* go \u201ctoo far\u201d. You went just far enough. Kudos! \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA and for more help on how to handle her, visit r/justnomil . They've been through it all.", "NTA however I always tell people well I can\u2019t have kids I promised my first born to a witch and I really just don\u2019t feel like following thru on that deal anymore.  \n\nIn reality I have endometriosis and freaking fibroids on top of a fertility level that would be low as hell for even artificial fertilisation. Also every fertility test I\u2019ve ever taken, both packet and doctors show no fertility. So yea I go with a creative witch story.", "NTA people like this think they can chip away at other people indefinitely with no consequence. When it (or they) blows up on them they instantly flick over to victimhood\n\nHowever, the best defence is to call out the behaviour as what it is, not to obliquely attack in retaliation.", "NTA \n\nI think you handled it well TBH.", "NTA if people would simply keep their noses out of other peoples uteruses.", "Why does she dislike you?  I'm skeptical of the 'I won't get into the he said she said stuff'.  Most of the time people say that because they don't want to disclose what they've also done.", "What an exhausting life you living and just for a man to stay in it\u2026 is it worth all this? I can\u2019t imagine having my partner going all this and not stop it with all my power, you need to understand that they\u2019re making choices that suits them alone without thinking of the affects it has on you, you\u2019re exhausted and checked out from most of that part but the only solution is if they stepped up and end it for good. Have a deep conversation with them or start thinking about your mental health more because this is not the end you\u2019ll be in more disadvantage the more you keep them in your life", "NTA. \n\nShe pushed to the point that you were in pure emotion. Sure you could have taken it less far, but why would she deserve that???? Only someone more kind and polite would deserve an emotional reaction being reigned in. \n\nI just want to point out: \n\nNot all adoption is laden with trauma in the least. I was adopted at birth and it was never hidden from me. I have incredible parents and family and I've never felt anything other than obnoxiously lucky.\n\nI actually laugh at the way most ppl refer to adoption as a last resort bc realistically few have had as lucky a life and relationship w their parents as I do. Like my life has just been better than theirs and it's weird that they think genes are what make that possible. That it's a second rate choice...", "ESH. \n\nIt really boils down to the fact that you did this at a *family* dinner party. I totally get being frustrated, especially given that y\u2019all don\u2019t have a good relationship and that is an incredibly personal topic. That said, everything beyond asking what she wants to know about your private life was uncalled for in the setting. If it were just the two of y\u2019all and you went off it would have been slightly different. Doing this in front of other family members just leaves you looking like the bad guy (and honestly is probably pretty embarrassing for your S/O).", "Nta but I would have went with she must be dreaming if she thinks you would allow any children to be anywhere near her.

She was widowed, and he was her companion/meal ticket\u2014a situation which started long before his philandering father died.  I was accused of \"emasculating\" him (still haven't figured out where that came from), yet it was her who was trying to deny him a right to have a life of his own.\n\nYour partner is being better about it than mine was.

His uncle's wife, however, just would. not. let. it. go. over a dinner at their place (with their six kids and four grandchildren, plus my husband's parents, two brothers, and three niblings).

If you're so happy with your life choices, why would you care about mine?\"", "Honestly, it's the illusion of hope that wears you down I think.

She said those comments 4 years ago and has basically ignored me after my partner lost it at her and stopped talking to her for nearly 2 years.
