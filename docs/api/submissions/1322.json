We do a lot of things together, share a lot of passions/hobbies and we love to travel. \nThere is this one trip that is very expensive that I have wanted to go on for a few years. He was on board. Today We were talking and I mentioned the exact budget for this trip and gave him more details on what we would do and see. It turns out that he is not that interested in these things and he wouldn\u2019t want to spend that much money for this. He said that he should just send me by myself. \nAt first, I said that I would like to go with him but he said that he couldn\u2019t see himself spending this amount on this trip. This is where I am probably the AH. I said okay, I would go by myself and I suggested that it can be my 40th birthday gift. I also said that it doesn\u2019t have to be on my exact birthday, that I could go anytime, maybe when he is travelling for work or visiting family. \nHe was really hurt that I would consider going without him. His reasoning is that I offered him many times to go on trips that are his dream trips by himself because I couldn\u2019t go (because of work) and he always declined because he feels it wouldn\u2019t be a dream trip if we are not sharing it. I understand now that it was selfish of me to take him up on the offer and to want to go alone. I am also a little hurt that he offered it and it feels like I fell into a trap. \nI genuinely thought he was okay with me going since it was his idea. I would have never suggested going on my own if he didn\u2019t mention it. However, he is so hurt that he is saying it will change our while life together now and that he will start just living his dreams without thinking of me first. \nTo be clear, everytime I offered him to go on a trip without me, I really meant it and would have planned  everything for him with all my heart. Which is why I assumed the same when he said he wanted to send me by myself.\nAnyway, now, I feel like a huge asshole for considering this knowing he never took me up on any of my offers. \nSo, am I as big an asshole as I feel?

I feel like I need more here.  Are you talking about a trip to somewhere like Bora Bora, where you are going to spend thousands of dollars by yourself to sit in a hammock on the ocean?

At all. He offered for you to go on your dream trip- that he didnt want to go on - alone. You accepted. How were you to know he was playing some twisted mind game on you?

He has you thinking you are in the wrong with his manipulation & is deliberately trying to hurt you. Oh dear.", "NTA\nNTA\nNTA\nNTA\n Please go on your trip after explaining to him how and why it is important, and though you would rather he join you it is not fair for you to lose your dream because it's not his cup of tea.\nSeriously, sweetie, go.", "NTA he absolutely trapped you! What a d!ck.", "Well that\u2019s not fair. He literally offered. NTA", "NTA.

I don't particularly like vacations, but I've always been eager to ensure my wife gets to enjoy the things she wants to do. It's worked well for us.", "NTA you and your husband should still be able to do things by yourselves. You guys are individuals before being married. If this trip is truly a dream for you then your husband shouldn't mind it and definitely should not have made that offer a trap to hold against you. This is a \"fuck around and find out\" type of situation he fucked around with the offer and found out something he didn't want to hear. Even though it is clear from previous interactions that you never had an issue with him going on his own dream trips alone, it seems he was expecting you to act the same way he would have which makes him a major AH. Go on that trip bc he already said he would be doing his stuff alone from now on.", "NTA. Ungenuine people are exhausting to be around.

He suggested it first, and now he's making you out to be the bad guy for taking him up on it while you even suggested doing it during a time when he would already be away so you guys wouldn't be spending as long apart. \n\n\"He will start living his dreams without thinking of me, first\" & \"he feels it wouldn't be a dream trip if we were not sharing it\" are to conflicting, bullshit responses. I'd think that maybe he spoke too soon about you taking the trip yourself and didn't really mean it but he just happen to blurt it out, but with his response of guilt tripping you doesn't seem like this was a genuine \"whoops I dunno why I said go alone\". \n\nAre you guys doing okay financially? Cause I'm wondering if maybe he's trying to guilt trip you into not going on an expensive trip because of money problems.", "NTA that is manipulation 101. He has some nerve. You did want to include him. He is the one who bailed out and doesn't want to go. Then says go then gets mad you say okay? What a brat. You aren't an AH at all in this situation.", "ESH he should not have set you up like he did, if he was not ok with you going by yourself he shouldn't have offered. On the other hand he's been very consistent with not taking solo trips that he would like that you wouldn't and you kinda suck too for not picking up on that until after it was spelled out for you.\n\nYou should both apologize to each other and you probably shouldn't go on the trip, no way a vacation is worth hurting a relationship over.", "NTA. I am 38F, married to a 42M. Been together 20 years and you know what? Sometimes we have to do things that aren't always together. He is more than welcome to go on a solo trip to where he wants to go while you do the trip you want.\n\nHe is manipulating you and guilt tripping you. Don't let him do that, it's not fair to you.

Then when he backpedaled, you were okay with not doing it. \n\nI can\u2019t say that if I was planning a Disney trip and my fianc\u00e9e didn\u2019t want to go that I would choose to never go to Disney - I would hit up a friend and plan something whenever he goes on a work trip etc. \n\nI say this from experience, because while it wasn\u2019t a dream vacation - we had a mutual friend that had to drive for a work conference this summer (she has medical issues and her husband couldn\u2019t take off work to go) and it happened to be near a beach so she asked me to go. I talked to my fianc\u00e9e (I love the beach and I love spending time with this friend) and he was okay with it! I was gone for a week and had fun, brought back souvenirs for him and a new lingerie set to surprise him when I got home and later that year he took a week off for a video game release that he was stoked about (not the same since he was at home and I still came home after work.) \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA, but I do think y\u2019all need to talk. If this is your dream vacation then you deserve to go at some point. He is your partner, but I don\u2019t understand why he doesn\u2019t want you to be happy for sick it up and join you (might not be his dream vacation but then the next time y\u2019all plan something it could be about something he wants to do versus what y\u2019all want to do).", "NTA. He knew it was your dream trip, got on board, downplayed it, suggested you go alone, and then got upset when you called his bluff. All that \u201cthis will change our life together\u201d nonsense is him being manipulative. He\u2019d have been fine with you canceling the whole thing because he didn\u2019t feel like spending money on it, so he\u2019s more concerned with his wants than he is yours.", "NTA.\n\n>  I am also a little hurt that he offered it and it feels like I fell into a trap.\n\nI\u2019d be more than \u201ca little hurt\u201d by that if I were you.  I\u2019d be pissed.  Why is he making offers he expects you to say no to?  Does he *not* want you to trust that he\u2019s sincere about what he says?  And why is he acting like the only options here are that the two of you do everything joined at the hip or you don\u2019t consider each other at all on anything, ever?  What\u2019s so terrible about you having a dream or hobby that\u2019s just yours?", "NTA - but let\u2019s look at the manipulation here:\n\n1. You planned to go with him\n2. He wasn\u2019t interested and told you to go alone\n3. You resisted but ended up agreeing\n4. He acts butthurt and tells you you\u2019re selfish\n\nThis is straight from the manipulator\u2019s hand book. Be mindful that you might be getting set up for something he wants to do without you (open the marriage comes to mind but I\u2019ve been Redditing a lot lately).", "NTA. I find it odd he said he would start doing his own dreams without considering you after you've talked about this trip for years and wanting him to come along with you. It's a power struggle: \"how dare you do something for yourself. fine, I'll do everything I want for myself without thinking of you first!\" \n\ndon't let his hissy fit stop you from going on this dream trip you've wanted to for years.", "NTA, but boy did he go from 0 to passive-aggressive-guilt-trip in a hurry. He should not have offered for you to go alone if he didn't mean it. I hope you work it out with him so you can go on this trip alone, and I hope you have an amazing time!!!", "NTA\n\nIf he didn't mean it, he shouldn't have suggested it. Why is it an issue if it's your dream, but not his? It would be quite selfish for him to expect that you can only have dreams that involve him.", "NTA\nI agree that he was being very manipulative. Unless you read minds or have a crystal ball, you would not have known. He handled it very poorly.", "NTA He said maybe you should go alone, and is now upset that you agree? Jeeze what a great guy /sarcasm. \n\nAnd he's throwing a tantrum by saying now he's just not gonna consider you at all? Wasn't he already doing that by not wanting to go on the trip in the first place? \n\nI'd say go on this trip and see what your life could be without him! He doesn't have a guarantee there will be a 12th year, iykwim.", "NTA\n\nIs it exhausting to be married to someone who has to test you to gauge your love for him? Based on his response, he sounds extremely insecure and petty. Living his dreams without thinking of you because you fell into a trap he set for you?\n\nPeople who love each other want the best for one another. Your definition of a dream trip does not need to align with his - you are different people with different interests. \n\nYou should not feel like an asshole. You're just married to one.", "NTA. It was his suggestion, and now he\u2019s being manipulative and blowing everything out of proportion. Is there something else going on with him/the relationships? Or is this consistent with how he usually acts?", "It is a scuba diving vacation in a remote, pristine place. We both scuba dive but his interest is in locations with more big life whereas this place is more coral/macro. It would cost about twice what we normally spend on a vacation.", "We can afford to save for the trip as it is 2 years until my 40th. Also, he would be okay with spending that amount of money on a trip we could both enjoy.", "What kind of game playing do you think is acceptable in relationships?  She offered & meant it but he said no. He offered, didn't mean it & has set out to make her life miserable. They're married not stapled together.", "You only die once - unless you\u2019re a Winchester.", "He is deeply hurt because he passed on going on trips without me because he felt that it wouldn\u2019t be a dream without sharing it with me. He feels that today he learned a hard lesson that I don\u2019t feel the same way and that it changes the reality of our marriage. That\u2019s why I feel like such an asshole for hurting him so bad.", "Double a normal vacation doesn't sound crazy.\n\nAbsolutely go.\n\nFor your marriage's sake you should be very clear with your husband that you will be going. Tell him that you'd love for him to come too, as originally planned, but you will 100% be going for your 40th.\n\nHe's hurt (and very immature about it) but there is also some flexibility that he didn't realise quite how important this trip was to you and also that he didn't realise how he would actually feel about being left behind.\n\nIt's a common human failing to say something that will make someone happy and then to realise later on that you've overpromised. \n\nSo be kind and absolutely inflexible. You are going. You'd love him to share it with you.", ">He is deeply hurt because he passed on going on trips without me because he felt that it wouldn\u2019t be a dream without sharing it with me. He feels that today he learned a hard lesson that I don\u2019t feel the same way and that it changes the reality of our marriage. That\u2019s why I feel like such an asshole for hurting him so bad.\n\nI saw this response and wanted to respond to this as well. So it may not be a money issue if he can enjoy it as well, but it still seems very selfish of HIM. What else in the future are you not going to be able to enjoy because he doesn't want to participate? \n\nI can't get over how selfish he is being and the guilt trip he's laying on you. This sounds like something teenagers do \"He knew I couldn't go to the party but he went anyway because he wanted to! I can't believe how selfish he is to do things without me! I would NEVER go to a party without him!!!!!!! I told him he could go but he should have known better. He should have known that I only said that to not seem controlling! He shouldn't want to do anything without me. I can't believe him!!!\"", "He obviously wants to be the only one who can choose where and what you do in holidays. He is manipulative and selfish...", "I don't think any game playing is acceptable, I did say he shouldn't have done that.", "it was his choice not to go on those trips though, and it\u2019s not right for him to say that one dream not including him means you don\u2019t love him as much. \n\nIf he\u2019s the one who doesn\u2019t want to go on a vacation that he knows is one of your dreams then he can\u2019t also force you not to. It\u2019s really shitty of him to put you in a corner where you have to either hurt him or lose an amazing life experience. If you go alone you both get what you wanted in the first place anyway."]}
