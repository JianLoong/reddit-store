{"id": 3148, "submission_id": "z3tfrh", "title": "AITA for feeling entitled to food I did not technically pay for?", "selftext": "I (34M) recently went to a get-together with some friends of mine. I get along with most everyone within the group outside of one person, we will call him Mike. Mike is someone who I feel is selfish and can be a bully, and I feel it has gotten worse recently. However, we have all been friends since high school so I put up with it.   \n\nWell Mike decides he wants to have everyone over to play some Settlers of Catan. We used to get together a lot more to play board games or smash bros or what not, but as we all have gotten older that has obviously happened less and less. Fortunately everyone's schedules lined up and we were able to plan this.   \n\nNow it is important for me to insert here that recently I had been off work for a month. It was of no fault of my own, and fortunately I am back to work now. Bc of that though, money is really tight for me right now. My friends all knew this.  \n\nWe all go to Mike's to hang out and it was a great night. We end up staying longer than expected and people get hungry. Some people decide they want to order pizza. They ask if I want to throw in some money for pizza and I say \"no, gotta watch what I spend for a bit.\" Obviously I wanted some and could probably afford it but I was trying to be responsible. Another friend of mine (we'll call him jake) offered to put in for me but I tell him no, I will be ok. Maybe this is where I messed up.  \n\nAnyways, right as they are about to order, I remember that I have a coupon for the place they are ordering from. It had been my birthday a week prior and received it as a gift or something. I let them know I have it and that they can use it. It added on a medium 1 topping for free. They are excited for it and accept it. I guess its important to note that I just offered it willingly, not as a trade or bargain.  \n\nThe pizza arrives and everyone digs in. I ask everyone if its cool if I have some of the medium pizza. At first Jake and a couple others say yes but then Mike says \"You didnt put any money in. Why are you asking for pizza?\" I explained that this pizza wouldnt even be here if not for me but he says that it also wouldnt be here without him bc everyone else paid for the other pizza. Jake offered to throw in a few bucks for me again but Mike said its bullshit that I tried to pull this. It really put a damper on the night. I ended up leaving without having any.  \nMike sent messages in the group chat about how I tried to pull a fast one on everyone. Most everyone is trying to stay out of it outside of Jake who is still sticking by me. I understand that I didnt put money in, but I cant help but feel like he is making way to big a deal about this.  \n\nSo, I come to you all, AITA?\n\nEdit: added some spaces\n\nEdit 2: There appears to be some misunderstanding, but the coupon was spend $20, get a 1 topping pizza for free. Not that I just add on 1 topping to an existing pizza.

But the free pizza should have canceled out any qualms from Mike who is obviously a jerk.", "NTA you didn\u2019t assume and take pizza, you asked for a slice of the pizza your coupon provided. My friend group would have looked at you like an alien and go \u201cduh we aren\u2019t just going to eat in front of you\u201d so long as this wasn\u2019t a *constant* thing. Mike doesn\u2019t sound like a great friend.", "NTA These are your friends and Mike is a dick. People who don\u2019t share or will call YTA are tight fisted, mean spirited people who have obvious issues sharing. Pizza amongst friends should always be free if someone can\u2019t pay.", "NTA.

That's what friends are for.", "NTA \nBut the resentment you two carry for each other must be freezing the air every time you two end up in the same room.", "I, personally, have never in my life seen a coupon for a free topping. It just sounds ridiculous. \n\nI have, however, seen coupons for a free medium one topping pizza with purchase/on orders of $XX or more. I think people need to work on critical thinking skills, because to me it's obvious that you meant \"free medium one topping PIZZA\" and not a free topping.\n\nNTA. Regardless of if you put money in or not, what kind of shitty friends don't share food with someone? Jake is a great friend. Fuck Mike, what a AH.", "NTA\n\nThey got a whole pizza for free. Mike is def being an A about this.\n\nYou prob should have cleared up - hey if you use this coupon, can that be my share?

Fuck mike.", "NTA - you essentially paid your way in with the coupon that provided everyone with an extra pizza to share. Mike is an AH.", "NTA", "NTA. Mike is simply 100% AH. better not to associate yourself with this kind of toxic peer. not worth it.", "ESH. Except Jake. \n\nIt's true that without your coupon, the extra pizza wouldn't exist. But it's also true that without their $20 your coupon was worthless. \n\nIn my experience general social etiquette is that when someone has a coupon for the benefit of the group (that was free), then it's for the group and one person doesn't just take advantage of it. \n\nI think you should have had some pizza. But I think you were also super cheap.", "NTA but you said you 'obviously wanted some' so I feel compared to add: If you had some without paying you'd be TA but Coupon was your payment in this case.", "NTA.\n\nThey are your friends, or supposed to be, why are they so selfish and cruel?

It should have bought you a couple of pieces of the pizza.Yes, you wouldn't have that 1 topping medium pizza without their contribution. However, they also wouldn't have a 1 topping medium pizza without your coupon and now you no longer have that coupon on your possession. Anybody with a half a brain would recognize that you offering a coupon for an entire extra medium pizza was your contribution and payment for a couple slices of pizza. Mike is a massive cheap asshole and your friends should be reconsidering whether they want to hang out with him. You made it clear that you didn't have any money in the budget to chip in and it's a pizza FFS. Normally, when I host a party at my house, I ask what kind of pizzas everyone likes and just order it.

Technically you paid for the free medium by offering the coupon that you could have saved and earned it for yourself. Mike is the AH here, and you had every right to grab a few slices.

Mine would have shut that shit down and given you an equal potion from all the food ordered.", "NTA.

Yeah you wanted pizza but didn't want to put in for it. Social etiquette should have told the group you get a slice and that's the end of it.

By Mike\u2019s logic, no one should\u2019ve eaten that pizza except you. If he\u2019s a bully though, maybe try calling out his bad behaviour when it\u2019s not directed to you.
