I get along with most everyone within the group outside of one person, we will call him Mike. Mike is someone who I feel is selfish and can be a bully, and I feel it has gotten worse recently. However, we have all been friends since high school so I put up with it.   \n\nWell Mike decides he wants to have everyone over to play some Settlers of Catan. We used to get together a lot more to play board games or smash bros or what not, but as we all have gotten older that has obviously happened less and less. Fortunately everyone's schedules lined up and we were able to plan this.   \n\nNow it is important for me to insert here that recently I had been off work for a month. It was of no fault of my own, and fortunately I am back to work now. Bc of that though, money is really tight for me right now. My friends all knew this.  \n\nWe all go to Mike's to hang out and it was a great night. We end up staying longer than expected and people get hungry. Some people decide they want to order pizza. They ask if I want to throw in some money for pizza and I say \"no, gotta watch what I spend for a bit.\" Obviously I wanted some and could probably afford it but I was trying to be responsible. Another friend of mine (we'll call him jake) offered to put in for me but I tell him no, I will be ok. Maybe this is where I messed up.  \n\nAnyways, right as they are about to order, I remember that I have a coupon for the place they are ordering from. It had been my birthday a week prior and received it as a gift or something. I let them know I have it and that they can use it. It added on a medium 1 topping for free. They are excited for it and accept it. I guess its important to note that I just offered it willingly, not as a trade or bargain.  \n\nThe pizza arrives and everyone digs in. I ask everyone if its cool if I have some of the medium pizza. At first Jake and a couple others say yes but then Mike says \"You didnt put any money in. Why are you asking for pizza?\" I explained that this pizza wouldnt even be here if not for me but he says that it also wouldnt be here without him bc everyone else paid for the other pizza. Jake offered to throw in a few bucks for me again but Mike said its bullshit that I tried to pull this. It really put a damper on the night. I ended up leaving without having any.  \nMike sent messages in the group chat about how I tried to pull a fast one on everyone. Most everyone is trying to stay out of it outside of Jake who is still sticking by me. I understand that I didnt put money in, but I cant help but feel like he is making way to big a deal about this.  \n\nSo, I come to you all, AITA?\n\nEdit: added some spaces\n\nEdit 2: There appears to be some misunderstanding, but the coupon was spend $20, get a 1 topping pizza for free. Not that I just add on 1 topping to an existing pizza. An entirely new pizza was added\n\nEdit 3: Putting a comment I made for more clarity on my mindset\n\n\"In hindsight I wish I had put in money just to avoid this. But bc I had been off work for a month money was tight for me, and had to borrow a bit of money to get through. I would have felt guilty spending money on pizza so I didn't. I also didn't accept Jake's offer bc I just didn't want to have to feel indebted to someone else, even though I know Jake would have thought nothing of it.\n\nI think this is extremely stupid and not worth worrying about but was curious if people thought I was in the wrong at all\"", "created_utc": 1669320672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3tfrh/aita_for_feeling_entitled_to_food_i_did_not/", "score": 2279, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But the free pizza should have canceled out any qualms from Mike who is obviously a jerk.", "NTA you didn\u2019t assume and take pizza, you asked for a slice of the pizza your coupon provided. My friend group would have looked at you like an alien and go \u201cduh we aren\u2019t just going to eat in front of you\u201d so long as this wasn\u2019t a *constant* thing. Mike doesn\u2019t sound like a great friend.", "NTA These are your friends and Mike is a dick. People who don\u2019t share or will call YTA are tight fisted, mean spirited people who have obvious issues sharing. Pizza amongst friends should always be free if someone can\u2019t pay.", "NTA. Mike doesn't like you though. I have ordered extra food for my friends when they were struggling and they did the same for me. That's what friends are for.", "NTA \nBut the resentment you two carry for each other must be freezing the air every time you two end up in the same room.", "I, personally, have never in my life seen a coupon for a free topping. It just sounds ridiculous. \n\nI have, however, seen coupons for a free medium one topping pizza with purchase/on orders of $XX or more. I think people need to work on critical thinking skills, because to me it's obvious that you meant \"free medium one topping PIZZA\" and not a free topping.\n\nNTA. Regardless of if you put money in or not, what kind of shitty friends don't share food with someone? Jake is a great friend. Fuck Mike, what a AH.", "NTA\n\nThey got a whole pizza for free. Mike is def being an A about this.\n\nYou prob should have cleared up - hey if you use this coupon, can that be my share?

Fuck mike.", "NTA - you essentially paid your way in with the coupon that provided everyone with an extra pizza to share. Mike is an AH.", "NTA", "NTA. Mike is simply 100% AH. better not to associate yourself with this kind of toxic peer. not worth it.", "ESH. Except Jake. \n\nIt's true that without your coupon, the extra pizza wouldn't exist. But it's also true that without their $20 your coupon was worthless. \n\nIn my experience general social etiquette is that when someone has a coupon for the benefit of the group (that was free), then it's for the group and one person doesn't just take advantage of it. \n\nI think you should have had some pizza. But I think you were also super cheap.", "NTA but you said you 'obviously wanted some' so I feel compelled to add: If you had some without paying you'd be TA but Coupon was your payment in this case.\n\nEdited for spelling", "NTA.\n\nThey are your friends, or supposed to be, why are they so selfish and cruel?

It should have bought you a couple of pieces of the pizza.Yes, you wouldn't have that 1 topping medium pizza without their contribution. However, they also wouldn't have a 1 topping medium pizza without your coupon and now you no longer have that coupon on your possession. Anybody with a half a brain would recognize that you offering a coupon for an entire extra medium pizza was your contribution and payment for a couple slices of pizza. Mike is a massive cheap asshole and your friends should be reconsidering whether they want to hang out with him. You made it clear that you didn't have any money in the budget to chip in and it's a pizza FFS. Normally, when I host a party at my house, I ask what kind of pizzas everyone likes and just order it.

By Mike\u2019s logic, no one should\u2019ve eaten that pizza except you. If he\u2019s a bully though, maybe try calling out his bad behaviour when it\u2019s not directed to you.

I had an end of the year thing for them, some brought food, some couldn't contribute - I said no problem, I had some funding- but then others walked a plate right up to people not eating saying no one goes without food in this class if they wanted it.    At 18 they understood you don't keep food from people.", "Nta but honestly get some new friend besides jake bc the fact that y\u2019all make eachother pay for food or they don\u2019t eat is messed up.

You did pay for that pizza with your coupon cause with out it there would be no extra pizza.", "NTA for you and Jake, but Mike and the friends staying out of it are. Sure you didn\u2019t contribute financially, but because of you there was a medium free pizza they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had. He called you out to make you feel embarrassed enough to not question it, and your other friends took his side with their silence. Even if you hadn\u2019t given them the coupon, it would have been shitty if they hadn\u2019t offered you a slice knowing your financial situation.

I returned the favour when they were low in money. Or I've would have given them half my pizza anytime if they didn't ordered anything and I would never ask for money... \n\nAs this was I assume a one time thing Mike is extremely unreasonable and a massive jerk... and the other \"friends\" are dicks too.

Our order is usually 4 toppings we both like then 50/50 of one we both hate so our usual restaraunt usually plays nice and counts the two half toppings as one and rings it as a \"large 5 topping\"... when they get a new employee we get hit for my bloody black olive half and pay an extra $2", "So instead of saying \u201c3 topping pizza\u201d, you would spell out every single 3-topping combo you can make and give them all a name? That sounds tedious.", "What is a medium amount of topping? That is not a thing? There is toppings, and then extra toppings. \n\nThat seems more mental gymnastics than a medium one topping pizza. All about context.", "It's not weird at all. I was raised the same way.", "No, people mostly order the same 10ish pizzas, so everyone knows that a Hawaiian is ham, cheese and pineapple, and we just order whatever. \n\nDepends on the pizza place, the Pizza Hut/domino\u2019s kinda places usually have a ranking system, cheaper ones are called \u201cvalue\u201d or \u201ctraditional\u201d and then there\u2019s the \u201cpremium\u201d or \u201cprawn (shrimp)\u201d categories which cost more. \n\nThe non chain shops usually have a selection of pizzas priced individually and you can add/take away whatever you like.\n\nI\u2019m not saying 3 toppings is a stupid system, just that we don\u2019t use it, so I can understand how some people are confused by it. Just like you would be if op had said \u201cfree value pizza\u201d because it\u2019s just not a phrase you\u2019re used to hearing.", "You may consider adding one more ask, make it 3 if you are serious about sharing. Some cultures it's polite to refuse twice and accept the third offer.", "Yeah I've heard that, but we're all standard Midwestern Americans, so the \"three refusal\" rule doesn't really apply. I feel like asking twice is a happy medium for my anxiety--makes my point (of being polite) come across without making me feel I'm being too annoying (by repeatedly asking).\n\nPlus, most people who come over have been family friends for, geeze, at least 20 years, if not longer. We just had a family come over for Thanksgiving where the mom grew up with my eldest brother and babysat me and then I used to babysit HER eldest (who is now 22). At this point, all of us are like \"you know where the fridge is, help yourself, holler if you need something special\" lol", "I wasn't having a go at them for saying it like that, I was mentioning that they should clarify it. Fuck me.", "I ship this.", "NTA, and honestly who cheaps out like that Mike guy when you know a friend or acquaintance is in a genuine financial issue.", "NTA.\n\nFirst of all, that medium pizza was free (which was from the coupon you were kind enough to share with them, if not, there isn't this free medium pizza at all). \n\nSecondly, you were only requesting for some of the medium pizza. You didn't go about saying that entire medium pizza was yours and yours alone. Others were also fine with you taking a slice or two.\n\nAnd lastly, what great calamity or harm could ensue from you consuming a slice or two from a free pizza, that you helped to obtain?\n\nI think Mike just hates you for whatever reason and is looking for any opportunities to bring you down. So, what does he wants now actually?", "NTA - friends don\u2019t let friends go hungry", ". NTA mike is a butthead", "NTA. your contribution to the group was an extra pizza.", "NTA your friends suck this shouldn\u2019t even be an argument, feed your friends ppl", "NTA. The audacity Mike has to look at an INVITED GUEST in his home and ask why he is eating is beyond dickish. I live in the South and I have never had a gathering where food wasn\u2019t planned ahead or ordered as the night went on but I\u2019ve never asked a guest to chip in for pizza, that\u2019s what like $30? The coupon would just be a welcome bonus at that point.", "I can't imagine begrudging a friend some pizza. Even if I did, you contributed a coupon. It wasn't money but that pizza had a dollar value. Mike saying you're trying to pull a fast one over $5 worth of bread and pepperoni is... wow. Like it's the heist of the century. NTA", "NTA, you absolutely did put in for the pizza in the form of a whole free pizza coupon. It's not money, but you exchanged it for a good or service, so what's the difference in this situation? Mike is being an asshole.", "Shout out to Jake for being the only decent human in the friend group. Definitely NTA", "NTA", "Mike is one of those dipshit assholes... they are unfortunately fairly common... people who make a big deal out of little things...\n\nAs you know, maybe you should have accepted Jake's offer or more clearly stated and confirmed that your coupon was you putting in for a slice or two\n\nNTA, \nbut learn from it and do better at proactively hedging off assholes like Mike so they can't start shit", "NTA\n\nGroup pizza. \n\nBut also if you are on a budget so don't pay your share you shouldn't stop someone else from contributing in your place. \n\nIt wasn't you he's helping out but the rest of the group. You refused to let him help everyone else thinking it was about you and it wasn't.", "Yeah and he is the one that pulled a fast one. OP contributed a whole pizza and Mike didnt allow him to eat.", "Hell, even when me and my friends were all semi-broke in our 20s, we wouldn't let someone go hungry because they were broke-broke that month. Like, it would be one thing if one person was ALWAYS trying to mooch, but in a situation like this it wouldn't even be a question of one person offering to throw in, we'd all just be like \"it's fine, we got you covered.\" The idea of grown ass people int their 30s being this stingy really pisses me off. And that's BEFORE you get to the part where his coupon got them a whole damn pizza! Even by stingy people logic, he should get a slice of the coupon pizza, because he otherwise could've kept the coupon and used it himself later."]}
