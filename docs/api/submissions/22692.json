I haven't been in a relationship with his dad since before he was born. Over the years my son's dad has been in and out of his life. He's always taken care of us financially and is a great dad when he is around, however, he has serious mental health issues (bpd) and has struggled with addiction.\n\n\rMy son has a 2-year-old half-brother. From what I understand he's only seen his brother once this year despite the fact he's been seeing his dad on a regularly basis. I didn't previously know much about the situation other than the fact his mom had full physical and legal custody. \n\n\rRecently the brother's mom messaged me on Facebook and told me that their dad hadn't seen much of her son this year but that she still wanted her son and my son to be in each other\u2019s lives. I somewhat agreed with her, and I know my son would like to see more of his brother. She asked if she and I could meet up at some point with the boys at a park. I was realistic with her and told her that I'm busy and that she's more than welcome to pick my son up and take him with her for a few hours, but I'm not really interested in spending time with her and her son.\n\n\rShe told me she wasn't comfortable with that as she thinks it would make their dad mad if my son told him she had taken him out and \"knows that my son can be difficult\". When I asked her to explain her comment, she told me that every time their dad left her alone with my son it was a nightmare for her as he misbehaved and disrespected her. After this I changed my mind and told her she couldn't even pick my son up and that if she wanted the boys to have a relationship, she would have to convince their dad to give a shit about his 2nd son. \n\n\rI did however text my ex and let him know about our conversations and asked him to make some time to get the boys together. But he replied telling me the boy's mom is crazy and that he'll try to get the boys together but that he didn't want to deal with her.\n\n\rMy boyfriend thinks I overreacted and that I am being an asshole for not facilitating a relationship between my son and his brother and that I was rude to my ex's other baby mama (ignoring the fact she was rude about my child). However, I disagree and think it's barely my business and it's their dad's choice how much the boys see of each other.

Sounds like the dads a deadbeat and if you want your children to have a sibling relationship it\u2019s on you guys\u2026 you can\u2019t meet at a park but she can take your kid?

I wholeheartedly agree with your boyfriend", "I want to say y t a but the dad is the bigger asshole.

You and the other mom don't sound like you have a good relationship. Your son sounds indifferent to the other boy, which considering he's 13 and the other kid is 2, isn't surprising. I wouldn't go out of my way to force it. \n\nThe other mom calling up asking for your son to spend time with his half-brother then going on a rant about what a \"nightmare\" he is behavior-wise would have shut down the entire conversation for me. So why even call if that's how you feel? I would be worry how she would treat my son, and I would not be eager to put a lot of energy into this. Sad to say, Dad has a lot of problems and the boys will probably not have a close relationship and it should not fall on your shoulders to facilitate this.", "NTA- in my opinion, I think she was looking for a babysitter.\n\nShe probably wanted to eventually drop the 2-year-old with you so the brothers can bond and she would get free time.", "YTA. Your Boyfirend (if that is his real name) is right that you are overreactinf. I don't care if the other boys mom is crazy, but you seem to be a little mean to her.

The half-borther must be terrified, simply quaking in his jeel)", "You sound like you did the right thing.  Honestly though, it's best the dad arranges everything.

Why is she ok with this lady taking her son for a few hours?? It doesn\u2019t sound like they even know each other. I\u2019m going with YTA on that alone.", "This was 2 years ago now and nobody told me he had at the time. From what I've seen he generally behaves while with his dad and he never told me of any issues. I think it's weird she wants our sons to have a relationship while at the same time calling my son a nightmare. If she was that pressed about his behaviour she should have told me at the time.", "He has an interest in seeing his brother but I wouldn't say he is upset over not seeing him.", "In this situation dad doesn\u2019t see the two year old, so really it\u2019ll be up to the moms to work it out. It was weird for her to just be okay sending her teenage son over to this woman she doesn\u2019t really know. You\u2019d think you\u2019d want to meet in person a little bit. Op you should probably invest more into this situation especially because you outright said your son is interested in seeing his brother. \n\nI do want to note I highly doubt 2 year olds mom is \u201ccrazy\u201d. In the US it is EXTREMELY difficult for a mother to get full physical and legal custody without a very well documented reason. As long as dad shows up to court, they\u2019re getting some type of partial custody of their kids.\nDad can have felonies, a history of domestic abuse, a documented drug history and all, as long as they show up they\u2019ll get something, even if it\u2019s limited or supervised, they\u2019ll still end up with at least some time.", "NTA for standing up for your son. No one told you about any behavior issues at the time and it seems like she didnt give you any details. Obviously you cant do anything about whst happened two yearss ago because your son might not recall specific incidents to give you his side of things. What she views as disrespectful mightve been normal 10 year old behavior. I do think your comment about ex not givibg a crap about theur shared son was uncalled for. You couldve texted this: it would be best to allow ex to handle building a relationship between the boys due to schedule issues.", "I\u2019d say nta. I agree that it\u2019s their dad\u2019s final say.", "When your son is grown up, would you rather have him feel A) grateful that you helped him build a relationship with his lil bro even though their dad was a flake, or B) resentful that he barely ever saw his brother because apparently sitting in a park for an hour was too much to ask? She was very specific that your son behaved badly WHEN LEFT ALONE WITH HER, indicating that he behaved okay as long as one of his parents was around. (And kids lashing out at stepparents is a tale as old as time. If her own partner didn't support her at the time, why on earth would she have thought that tattling to her partner's ex would have been any more helpful?) So IMO her wanting the boys to have a chance to build a relationship but insisting that you stay to be responsible for his behavior sounds completely reasonable.", "very good assessment.\n\nAnd Addict dad gets to call ex gf Crazy?  I bet he was a joy to be with for her.", "Just find some time to take the kid to the park sometimes so he can see his brother. PUT HIM FIRST. \nYTA.", "OP is the AH. She saw an opportunity for a free babysitter once or twice a month so tried to make the arrangement from the beginning that the other mom could take both boys. When it wasn\u2019t going to work out that way she let it be known she couldn\u2019t care less about her son having a relationship with his half brother unless it involves absolutely no effort on her part.", "Never let a stranger take your son. This woman has said negative things about him, when he was just a little kid. \n\nShe may blame your son for any of their relationship going bad, and she may put him in danger with other strangers.\n\nShe\u2019s totally the AH. You\u2019re not but you also need to protect your kid more is my 2 cents", "I\u2019m confused by your reaction to her saying your son had behavioral problems. Seems like that offended you and you gut reacted by pulling back the offer for her to pick up your son. If this was my son, I\u2019d be curious and concerned and ask him about it before assuming the ex made it up. \n\nESH cause all 3 parents are thinking about themselves instead of the kids. It is important for kids to have as close of a relationship as possible with all siblings. You seem slightly uncomfortable with having to spend time with the mom, which is understandable, and also seem to be being petty because you got offended by her comment about the misbehaving, but you\u2019re in the position to facilitate important bonding time between your son and his sibling. This is about your son and what\u2019s best for him, not what would be slightly inconvenient for you.", "Sounds like he probably didn't show up", "YTA. So...you won't meet this woman in a park because you're uncomfortable, but you'll have this woman take your son and do some free babysitting? \n\nShe made an effort here and was not unreasonable in saying she wasn't comfortable watching your son. It's fine if you don't want to facilitate this relationship, but she isn't an AH for trying.", "YTA - I\u2019m confused as to why you would prefer a stranger to you, come and collect your son and take your son out without you present? Irresponsible at best. It is healthy to maintain a relationship between the brothers and she presented the best solution to do that where your both comfortable? \n\nYour ex is clearing uninterested and unreliable so why would you put that on him knowing what he\u2019s like?", "YTA.  For saying you have no interest in spending time with her or her son and there seems to be no debate that your son \"misbehaved and disrespected her\".  And then taking you ex's word that the mother is 'crazy'.  Asking for you to take time out for your child is not 'crazy'  This is not about you. your side of the story sounds very much about your time and personal feelings about going to the park... and zero about the kids.", "YTA", "INFO Does your son want to spend time with his half brother? \n\nI don't understand her motivation. If she thinks your son's a nightmare, and the dad will be mad to find out they talked, why the push to hang out?"]}
