Next time she brings it up, just say something along the lines of  'it's really kind of you to think of me, but I'd be uncomfortable getting a gift from a coworker'", "NTA\n\nGifts can imply obligation to reciprocate or bond. Perhaps a gentle comment that you appreciate the thought, but a gift would make you uncomfortable.", "NTAH  you could tell her you prefer not to get into gift exchange at the office or that they should donate to a charity instead.", "NTA at all and its not at all rude to tell her a gift would make you uncomfortable. if she asks you why, just say you don't like to make a big deal about your birthday at work and you also put up a  boundary about your relationship....eg you ard coworkers, not friends.", "NAH you could say something along the lines of \"That's really nice, but you really don't have to.\" I even say that to friends/family members. Be nice about it and if she still gets you something just accept it.", "Sounds like you dont want a friendship with her in general, you dont like this girl do you?", "YWNBTA, as long as you phrase it in a thoughtful way!", "NTA. If it appears that she wants to buy you a gift, simply state (firmly) that you don't feel comfortable exchanging gifts with co-workers, but it is so nice of her to think of you.\n\nIf she persists and REALLY wants to do something for you, she can buy you a coffee that morning or something small like that to make the day special.", "You have an absolute right to not want anyone to give you a birthday gift.  However, the way you handle it will decide if you\u2019re an asshole or not.\n\nIf you calmly explain that you want a professional relationship with her, then YWNBTA.\n\nIf you calmly explain that you don\u2019t like birthday presents and parties, then YWNBTA.\n\nIn every other case, YWBTA.", "NTA. Gifts are nice to get if wanted, but they can become a real transactional chore if they aren't. I had a similar situation where the person gave me a gift anyway, it was a shirt I didn't like from a store I didn't like. I just ended up donating it. But now, I feel obligated to get something in return. Otherwise, I'd feel like ITA . This is the kind of exchanging of cheap crap that companies rely on to make profit imo.", "NTA. But do you celebrate birthdays with other coworkers?", "Solution:  ask for cash. Then, whatever amount she gives you, just save it until her birthday comes around and give it back to her or buy her a gift card with it lol.  \n\nOr you could ask for a Starbucks gift card or some other type of place that hopefully she also patronizes. Then, repeat the above steps\ud83d\ude00", "NTA. Have an honest conversation with her about your feelings on the subject. Let her know that you appreciate the thought, but that you're not comfortable with gift giving at work.   \n\n\nI'm sorry you have to deal with this whole thing. I HATE when coworkers try to implement gift giving at work. \"So and so's birthday is next week so we're all chipping in to buy her X\". Could we not please? It creates such an awkward situation where you're made out to be the bad guy if you say no.", "Lots of other good comments posted already, so I\u2019ll just say that a compromise could be to say you\u2019d just like a card. Not a gift card, a birthday card with a note. (Bonus: What she writes may shed light on her obsession with gifting you things.) I say this as someone who enjoys gifting and has a spouse who overtly dislikes being given presents or celebrating birthdays, which I don\u2019t understand but completely respect and conform to! It\u2019s not a good gift when the gesture is all about the giftee - in this case your boundary-stomping coworker. \n\nDepending on how your company works, this could turn into an HR issue. I\u2019d start documenting interactions in case she really starts harassing you about this or make false accusations of you mistreating her or something else unhinged.", "I guess NTA and NAH though this seems a bit standoffish to me\u2026but your birthday, your choice. \n\nSome cultures get really into gift giving.\n\nAnyway you can say: I prefer not to make a fuss over my birthday and I would prefer no gifts but thank you for thinking of me. \n\nI have a very good girl friend who absolutely doesn\u2019t want you to acknowledge her birthday. I don\u2019t know why. But she made it clear: never ever do anything for her birthday. We party together talk about boys together all the regular girl friend stuff. But never ever her birthday. She Romanian. Is that a Romanian thing? Anyway as her friend I choose to respect her boundaries even if I don\u2019t understand it and it kills me just a little when her birthday comes around that I can\u2019t even say \u201cglad you\u2019re in the world!\u201d \n\nBut you aren\u2019t wrong to set a boundary. Just be polite about it and maybe maybe maybe open your heart a crack to this person who sounds nice and thoughtful.", "No, you wouldn't be the asshole if you told her not to buy you a gift. You could simply say that you appreciate the offer, but you're not comfortable with exchanging gifts as you're not that close. It's better to be honest and clear about this than to accept a gift that makes you uncomfortable. **NTA.**", "NTA. \n\nGetting into work arms race of gifting is horrible. \n\nYou did the right thing. I am the same, and I have no regrets. \n\nIf they are offended, that is their problem. \n\nCoworkers can be friendly without all of the gift-giving and bringing in food. \n\n**Don't eat the food they bring for you.**", "Why did you say \"I don't know yet.\" clearly she was asking in a way that she would get you something. From there you should have said, nah nothing, but thanks. You gotta put an end to this in a mature way: \n\n1. Say you don't want anything the next time she asks. And say this firmly.\n\n2. Just accept whatever she gives you. Say thanks.\n\n3. Quit, skip town, get a new name, dye your hair.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe they just want to do their job, be friendly, and keep their coworkers out of their personal life.", "See I'd say that's a much bigger YTA move.

What if she asks 'oh, where did you get that necklace? is that new?' or similar questions? Or sees that the OP posted on social media about her doing something for her birthday? \n\nYes, you can lie or try and ignore the question and turn the conversation, but a lot of people wouldn't be comfortable with that. Especially if they work together for a long time. Then the OP'd have to do that annually. \n\nIt's so much easier to say that you don't want to give or get gifts between coworkers.", "I have a go to charity with link for when people want to give me gifts.
