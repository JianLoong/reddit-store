This specific co-op comes with several requirements, such as a $52,000 down payment, and $45,000 in post closing liquidity (this apparently is standard in NYC). His mother (let's call her Anna) offered to lend us this money, and the real estate agent suggested the mortgage be under Anna and Alex's name, so that we can do less money transfers. However, only two people can be on the mortgage, so I wouldn't be on the mortgage.\n\nThe plan is we would pay the mortgage payments split 50/50, and the loan back to his mom split 50/50 (to be paid over the next 5 years).\n\nI told Alex, that I'd prefer the mortgage also be in my name since I will be putting half of the costs with him, but him and his mom are telling me I shouldn't be on the mortgage since I'm not able to contribute to the down payment. However, he isn't contributing to the down payment either, and we'd be paying his mom back 50/50 together.\n\nThey said I shouldn't be on the mortgage since my mom can't lend us money for the downpayment and his mom is taking a bigger loss. I understand that she is taking a loss but my mom just bought a house that needs repair-work down and she doesn't have as much savings. My mom offered to lend me $35k she has left to show \"post closing liquidity\" but then she'd need the money back for the repairs. Anna offered the $52k loan without us asking her for it, and she also has about double that in savings. My mom's financial capabilities are different and she has offered what she can.\n\nI told Alex I don't understand why I will be paying half of a mortgage, and half of the down payment back to his mom over the next few years, but have zero percent ownership of the home or be on the mortgage.

Not something pleasant to consider, but please consider it because this could possibly be a poor financial decision. I find it always gets tricky when you borrow money from family so I suggest, if possible, avoid at all costs.

Look, what a lot of people here don\u2019t seem to understand is that your lender probably will not let you be a joint owner of the shares (when you buy a coop, you aren\u2019t buying fee title to real property, you are buying shares in the corporation that owns the building). If you jointly own the shares with Alex, yet you aren\u2019t subject to the terms of the loan documents, it makes it much more complicated for lenders to seize the asset in event of default.  They want Mom on the mortgage because they are not ok with another creditor having an interest secured by the asset.  I think you need to decide if you want to get this coop now in the manner they are suggesting or wait until you can afford it without Mom. \n\nThey\u2019re not trying to pull one over on you, this is just how these things shake out sometimes. Lenders have to protect themselves, that\u2019s just how it is. \n\n(I am not your lawyer and none of the foregoing should be construed as legal advice in anyway.)", "You may be confusing terms. Not being on the mortgage is great. It means you aren't legally responsible for paying for anything. If you were to break up later, this would make your life simpler and give you some leverage.\n\n\nWhat you don't want is to be on the mortgage and not be on the title. Not having your name on the title is an absolute deal-breaker (unless you work out some contract where you pay rent and he and his mom own the home).", "What if it's you and the mom?  She's far less likely to screw her son over than you.", "I'd be happy to not be on the mortgage as long as I'm on the deed/title.  That gives one  ownership of the property but not the debt.  \n\nYou can easily have more than 2 people on the deed and the mortgage so that's bs. But again, focus on being in the deed.  If you don't,  when you get married, they will claim it is non marital property and you will have no ownership of the condo if you divorce.  \n\nIf they say no,  I wouldn't live there unless it was for some cheap rent and I would absolutely not pay one dime toward any condo fee, repair, improvement, or taxes. If an appliance breaks, they can pay to fix it.  \n\nAnd get a lease with good terms.\n\nEdited to add:  if you aren't on the deed, I would absolutely not post back the loan from his mother.  That should be his responsibility. Plus, once it is paid back,  is her name removed from everything?  Sounds like the realtor is representing his mom and not you and the bf.", "It's a really bad idea in most states to buy a home as an unmarried couple. With a married couple, if you divorce, a court can compel the sale of the home and split the proceeds, and if one person buys out their ex-spouse's share of the real estate, that transaction is tax-free.\n\nWith an unmarried couple, if you break up, a court cannot compel the sale of the home, so your equity can be tied up if your ex doesn't want to sell and drags his feet on buying out your share. Also, if one of you does buy out the other's share, it's not tax-free.\n\n(You can check the laws in your state, but in most of the United States, an unmarried couple breaking up has significant obstacles to asset division that don't exist in the case of a divorce).\n\nIt sounds like he wants to own this with his mom, in which case A) you should pay 0% of the down payment, B) you should negotiate rent, and C) you should not pay at all for any additional expenses (repairs, improvements, taxes, etc.)", "Esh.

She doesn\u2019t need to ask for security for her loan if she trusts her son to pay it back, it\u2019s very easy to draw up a loan agreement that doesn\u2019t ask for security or that is secured on other assets (e.g. their car, their jewellery, whatever) as long as it\u2019s not going to be secured on the value of the house being bought and it therefore won\u2019t leave the mortgage company out of pocket if the buyers go bankrupt/die without paying off the mortgage and the house gets repossessed.\n\nDemonstrating that an unsecured loan isn\u2019t laundered money is usually quite easy and there\u2019s no fraud involved as long as Anna can demonstrate she came by the money honestly and they can demonstrate that she lent it to them. It\u2019s more paperwork and can be time consuming to get all of the evidence in place but it isn\u2019t usually complicated. The only reason it would get anyone charged with fraud would be if the money was obtained illegally, if it was given as a gift without appropriate taxes being paid, or if the mortgage was being taken out on the basis of money that wasn\u2019t actually available.\n\nIn some ways Anna would be in a better position than the bank on this one - if the happy couple go bankrupt, the bank gets back a portion of whatever their total assets are worth when all their other debts are taken into consideration, which might be less than the amount they lent out if the value of the property and their other assets doesn\u2019t cover all the debts; but Anna, as a beloved family member, might be able to convince them to continue making loan payments voluntarily even after the bankruptcy has been processed and their obligation to repay other lenders has been terminated.", "So why on earth would you be repaying Anna if you'll have no legal claim/ownership of the co-op?", "Then perhaps it\u2019s too soon for him to buy.

She can\u2019t give them one of those and then sue them for not repaying a loan that had its whole basis in mortgage fraud. All OP or BF would have to do is produce Anna\u2019s own sworn statement that it was a gift. This is a really common problem. Anna\u2019s money isn\u2019t safe without being an owner."]}
