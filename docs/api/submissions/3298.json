But this summer everything changed I\u2019ve had a total glow up, puberty really hit me like a rock. I\u2019m totally unrecognizable, In no way I\u2019m saying I\u2019m saying I\u2019m absolutely gorgeous but I\u2019m a lot better looking than I used to be. I finally looked my age for the first time in my life. (I\u2019ve always looked a lot younger just a fyi) anyways fast forward to the first day of school I wore a kinda slutty top to be totally honest lmao, but I wasn\u2019t really expecting the attention I got. A lot of it was girls giving me dirty looks for absolutely no reason plus guys being gross. After that I covered up way more like constantly wearing oversized hoodies etc. anyways a couple weeks later I get sent sreenshots by my one friend let\u2019s call sarah. Basically a bunch of girls made a group chat dedicated to figuring out if I got a boob job over the summer? Like they were literally comparing my old pictures from the year prior to now and how I was basically all plastic. I\u2019ve never been so weirded out, like y\u2019all dedicated a entire group chat to my tits? Like honestly why do they care so much, and why were they looking lmao. So Sarah and I have been contemplating whether or not to post the screenshots to show everyone how creepy they are. I\u2019m being deadass when they literally took pictures from my insta and zoomed into my boobs. Like who does that, obviously them I guess. So should I should I out them as weirdo creeps? Or would I be the asshole because honestly I don\u2019t think there\u2019s coming back from that. Or maybe go to the school? I\u2019m kinda on the edge of everything so I came to reddit to get y\u2019alls opinions.\n\n\n(Update) after listening to all of you, i\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not going to the school because now that I\u2019m thinking about it. This group chat wasn\u2019t made on school property thus they won\u2019t do jack shit. So I posted the screenshots on my snap story (I have all them added) a couple of the girls actually slid up apologizing and asking me to take the screenshots down and random people I have added, majority are from my school. Shit on these girls to the max. I honestly feel like they deserve it considering they didn\u2019t even know me but still decided to slut shame me and say my tits were fake? And even creepier had pictures they zoomed in on to try and figure out if they \u201cfake\u201d. But that\u2019s honestly all I have for now thank you all for the supportive comments I really appreciate it. And once I\u2019m off break I\u2019ll give another update. It\u2019s gonna be a shit show", "created_utc": 1669463857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z55utw/wibta_if_i_exposed_the_girls_who_made_an_entire/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should speak to your school, a trusted female teacher or something. Report them officially. It can probably be defined as sexual harassment, in a way.", "NTA and I agree with reporting it to the school rather than making it into a social group war.", "NTA. These girls are bullying you and obsessing over your body. This behaviour is not ok. Report it to the school. If the school does nothing, then you can put the SCHOOL on blast on socials (but remove identifying info about who the bullies are).", "NTA. Sounds like a bunch of jealous girls who have nothing better to do. A better option is to report this to the school. This is a form of bullying and I\u2019m pretty sure the school and their parents can deal with it.", "Do you have a trusted teacher or guidance counselor you can talk to about this? It is a form of bullying but it\u2019s a bit murky considering someone is sharing private texts with you. \nAnd btw, there are always going to be people who judge you for a myriad of reasons that you can\u2019t control. Hold your head up high and you be you. Surround yourself with people who deserve you", "NTA. This is bullying. They should be reported to the school.", "NTA at all, it is unacceptable that they\u2019re doing that (and also super fucking weird). This feels like the appropriate time to start bringing in support, specifically from adults. I know that can be daunting (especially since you pointed out that you don\u2019t feel there\u2019s a way to come back from that), so it\u2019s okay to take a second to regroup and figure out how you want to proceed. Sarah may be a good person to lean on and weigh your options with, but please bring an adult into the fold soon.", "NTA that's creepy. Not even just mean girl bullies, but full on sexual harassment creepy too. Ask them why they're so obsessed with you\n\nGirls pulling stunts like that should be called out and made to feel uncomfortable. They were invasive and sexually harasssed you. Call it what it is. Out them if you want to.  Report it too tho. Def don't let it be swept under the rug", "NTA show your parents the screenshots before going to the school and let them involve the school if they decide to. I'd probably tell my girls yes it's wierd but not to let it make them self-conscious. Respect yourself and be quietly proud that they're that jealous of you. My oldest wore hoodies and baggy shirts almost until she graduated you do what makes you comfortable and don't let others decide for you who you want to be.", "NTA what they did was so weird and disgusting, you should definitely post the screen shots. What they did was not okay at all.", "NTA\n\nBeing a teenage girl sounds rough. I\u2019ll stick with the old danglers and acne, thank you.", "NTA expose those silly girls! But honestly that's hilarious! Good for you girl! Puberty hit you so hard the girls can't believe it! \n\nDon't let anyone make you feel bad, you have the right attitude about this. They must be jealous!", "NTA. Report them. This is cyber bullying and it\u2019s not okay. Their actions are causing you to change your behavior and that\u2019s awful. Please speak up to a trusted adult at your school. I\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this", "NTA. Not only is that bullying, that's stalking too if they are taking pictures. Rather than post them, I would report them to a trusted adult.", "NTA report this to the school!!! They can get worse over time and cause more problems. What if they are bullying other people too? You are handling well it seems but someone else could be extremely hurt and bad things have happened when a bully has gone too far!! \nPlease OP turn them in!", "NTA but I'd like you to think about whether you can handle the fallout of exposing them. Doing it would give an immediate sense of gratification, but if you think there's a chance they might get worse for exposing them publicly, or more people might start to hurt you, then evaluate whether you're in a place to deal with it. I think you should definitely report it to your principle or something though; either way, there should be some sort of responsibility for the way they've acted.", "NTA, but best might be to forward this to your school, to avoid escalation.", "NTA don't take it down. I say keep re uploading once a month and just tell them you'll stop doing it when YOU feel they've been through enough. Just say to them\n\n\n\"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Report them to the school (in writing/email) for sexual harassment and if nothing is done, file charges with the police and include the school's report... CC'ing the district administration.\n\nYWBTA if you just exposed them to the school however. That could get you in serious trouble as, depending on how much is revealed, could be close to child sex photography so might want to also remove it from your socials even though it won't remove it from the internet.\n\nBe mindful of what you post online, everything will be used against you.", "NAH\n\n> I\u2019ve never been so weirded out, like y\u2019all dedicated a entire group chat to my tits?
