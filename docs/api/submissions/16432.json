My paternal grandparents were my main caregivers while my mom worked until I was about 4 which is when she met Jason. There was some weirdness between them and I'm not sure about all that went on. But I do know when they were engaged (which was 6 months after they met) mom was in an accident and my grandparents took care of me until mom got out. I know this angered Jason and my mom. They felt like my grandparents should have left me with Jason, and given me a chance to bond with him, because to hear my mom tell it, all I wanted was my grandparents when I was little and when the accident first happened, I cried for them when I realized I couldn't see her. It sounds like there might have been a social worker involved though I don't really remember it.\n\nJason adopted me when I was 5. He and my mom had just gotten married. They told me it was going to happen and I asked them not to. But they told me Jason was going to be my dad. I never called him dad. I always used his first name and called him my stepdad, which bothered them. They blamed my grandparents because my grandparents shared a lot about my dad with me. Mom tried to cut me off from my grandparents but the courts declared that since I had such a strong attachment to my grandparents and they were a connection to my biological dad, that I deserved to maintain that relationship. I ended up getting to see them every other weekend and I got one overnight a month with them. I loved it.\n\nI never fully felt comfortable with Jason. He tried super hard to be my dad. He would spoil me, would take time out of his day to spend it with me. But he was also so jealous when he saw that I kept a photo of my dad close by my bed and when he walked in on me talking to the photo while I was little. He'd get upset when I wrote notes for my dad's grave for Father's Day. As a kid I used to believe more in people existing after death and knowing what we said to them and wrote for them. So I did that sometimes. I can recognize that Jason was pained by the fact I was talking to and writing to a dad I never knew and would never remember and still used his first name. But it doesn't change how I felt, or how I feel today. His hatred for my grandparents didn't win me over either. I do think I love Jason. But I would never say he was my dad.\n\nI'm now in my 20s and engaged to a wonderful human. My grandma is going to walk me down the aisle. I told my mom and Jason before asking, so they could be prepared. Jason asked about money, which I had never asked for or discussed with him. When I told him my fiance and I were paying he offered to pay so he could \"give me away\". I got mad, told him again that I never asked for that and said it was insulting to think he could pay me to walk me down the aisle.\n\nHe and my mom think I am insensitive to his feelings given I know he considers me his daughter and I have never accepted him as my dad.

The reason I do wonder if I'm TA is because Jason has tried for most of my life to be accepted and welcomed into my heart as my dad and I have never given him that, I am not very close to him, and I probably should have known he would be desperate for the chance at my wedding. And instead of being calm and understanding I got mad at his attempts and was insulted.

I know the fact my grandparents were able to take me when she had her accident made them realize they did not want me to go to them if she became seriously incapacitated or if she died.

I don't think weaponizing her feelings against him was a good move, and at least as far as her marriage goes, it seems like he has good intentions.", "If he was ever upset at you for doing that as a child, then he was completely in the wrong and I don't have any reservations about calling him an asshole for that.

I wonder if your grandparents supported that.
