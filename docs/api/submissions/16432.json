They felt like my grandparents should have left me with Jason, and given me a chance to bond with him, because to hear my mom tell it, all I wanted was my grandparents when I was little and when the accident first happened, I cried for them when I realized I couldn't see her. It sounds like there might have been a social worker involved though I don't really remember it.\n\nJason adopted me when I was 5. He and my mom had just gotten married. They told me it was going to happen and I asked them not to. But they told me Jason was going to be my dad. I never called him dad. I always used his first name and called him my stepdad, which bothered them. They blamed my grandparents because my grandparents shared a lot about my dad with me. Mom tried to cut me off from my grandparents but the courts declared that since I had such a strong attachment to my grandparents and they were a connection to my biological dad, that I deserved to maintain that relationship.

He would spoil me, would take time out of his day to spend it with me.

He'd get upset when I wrote notes for my dad's grave for Father's Day. As a kid I used to believe more in people existing after death and knowing what we said to them and wrote for them. So I did that sometimes. I can recognize that Jason was pained by the fact I was talking to and writing to a dad I never knew and would never remember and still used his first name. But it doesn't change how I felt, or how I feel today. His hatred for my grandparents didn't win me over either. I do think I love Jason.

I told my mom and Jason before asking, so they could be prepared. Jason asked about money, which I had never asked for or discussed with him. When I told him my fiance and I were paying he offered to pay so he could \"give me away\". I got mad, told him again that I never asked for that and said it was insulting to think he could pay me to walk me down the aisle.\n\nHe and my mom think I am insensitive to his feelings given I know he considers me his daughter and I have never accepted him as my dad.

I know the fact my grandparents were able to take me when she had her accident made them realize they did not want me to go to them if she became seriously incapacitated or if she died.

The fact that he not only thought he could buy his way into the role, but also thought it was reasonable to make that kind of bargain is absolutely insulting and offensive. \n\nI think they're being egregiously insensitive to *your* feelings considering they know you've never accepted him as your dad, even after they legally forced it on you against your will.\n\nI have no idea what your current relationship with them is like. You say you do think you kind of love him, so the relationship might be valuable to you. You might want to suggest family therapy or something similar, perhaps a therapist could help them actually listen to what you're saying, because at this point they've spent a good 15-20 years ignoring you on this subject, so it's likely they don't even process what you say anymore. \n\nYou might also want to consider personal therapy to work through your feelings in regards to Jason and your dad. It sounds like they've never given you the time or mental space to actually process the whole thing. If you've done it since becoming an adult? Good for you!

You have made your feelings clear, you're not responsible for people who can't accept that.", "Congrats on playing (not in a manipulative way) the long game and reaping the rewards!\n\nBy doing that, you\u2019ve made things the best they CAN be for both you and your son.", "That shows insecurity, for sure, but to infer that he doesn't love her because of that seems like a huge stretch. OP says she loves Jason. She just doesn't see him as her dad. She also says he did tried hard to be a parent. For the sound of that, he seems like a flawed but ultimately good person. My parents are not perfect. Probably yours are not perfect either. There's tons of shit they've done or said that hurted me, but I know they are not bad people and that, even with all those flaws, they do love me. We are talking about people here. Real people.", "That sounds like the exact opposite, actually. Sounds like Jason wanted to take over the role of Dad entirely, and the grandparents got in the way of him taking over her life. The mom was okay with hurting OP in order to get her picture-perfect family back. She's as complicit in the abuse as Jason.", "If you can't understand how awful it to ask someone if you can buy a once-in-a-lifetime emotional moment from the person she chose to spend it with I am sincerely sorry for you. I wouldn't trust anyone who made an offer like that - it implies that their \"affection\" is so shallow and for sale that they can't imagine anyone being different. OP getting mad was an entirely normal and healthy response, imo.", "So what you're saying is that they were completely selfish and lacking of empathy.", "Sorry to hear what you\u2019ve gone through. It\u2019s special that you get to have one of your favorite people walk you down the aisle and be a part of an ever lasting memory. I hope your mom and Jason will come around and can be more supportive of both you and your relationship with your paternal grandparents. You don\u2019t have to answer, but why did your mom try to keep you from seeing them? How come Jason has so much hatred for the people who love and help raised someone he loves and regards as a daughter?", "I wonder... My grandmother told me about a time she was in the hospital for a few weeks when my mom was a toddler.  My mother went to stay with her aunt and cousins, and pretty much bonded with them to the point where toddler-mom thought that her aunt was her mother and the cousins were her sisters.  Grandma tells about how toddler-mom was crying at home because she missed \"mommy and sister\".  If toddlers are loved, they will adjust very quickly to a new living situation, and adults with low emotional intelligence (which I suspect step-dad is) want to blame someone for \"alienating\" the child when it is just a natural survival thing.", "I really wish there was some sort of legal avenue to undo these sort of adoptions.", "To be fair, now that shes an adult he thinks they can changed with money \ud83d\ude44 at least he\u2019s a consistent kind of ah", "A lot of people seem to forget that kids are actually people, with all the same emotions, thoughts, and feelings as adults (without the developmental ability to properly control/discuss all those things), and instead act like kids should be good little robots who do what they're told. My dad very much had a \"I own you, you do what I say\" mentality when I was younger, down to the shoes I wore, screw what I thought about anything. Not surprisingly, I haven't talked to him in years.", "Yeah, OP doesn't HaVe To Go tO tHeRaPy if they're not interested in having a relationship with their step-dad. If they *wanted* one with him then sure, go for it. But it seems like a waste of time and money is OP is \"meh\" about their relationship.", "THIS!  The time for family therapy was when OP was little and should have been initiated by her mom and step father.  \n\nClearly this doesn't interest them, and even if OP could get them to go, I doubt she's going to get anything worthwhile out of it.  I don't get the feeling Jason would be open and vulnerable enough for therapy to have any value.   I imagine anything said in therapy, he would take as a personal attack on him.", "I agree with you OP could be thinking a little irrational here and being unfair to Jason.\n\nI think that's separate to the 'walking down the aisle' question though.\n\nShe's not an AH for that and I honestly think maybe Jason needs ironically to back off and stop being so desperate about it all. Ship has kinda sailed by this point.", ">Why is everyone here discounting the Mother's wishes for her child?\n\nI don't discount them, but I thing you cannot deprive your children from all of their family, especially when one parent is dead, you can't cut their family because you want a new partner/spouse. \n\nIf the courts granted OP's grandparents custody it was because something they did right. The mother was in the wrong when she chose a strange man over blood family when there is not a clear reason to do so.", "I just wish people would have a little more grace. \n\nJason sounds like a pretty great guy. He would spoil you and spend one on one time with you. He\u2019s been doing so for 20 years! But because he would get \u201cjealous\u201d and \u201cupset\u201d it\u2019s all for naught? And by the way, how did the jealousy and the being upset manifest? Did he scream at you? I doubt it, because you definitely would have included that. \n\nThat people expect perfection from stepparents that they would never expect from \u201creal\u201d parents is strange and gross. \n\nHow about telling him that you want to honor your gma for always being there for you by having her walk you down the aisle, but you would be honored to have a father/daughter dance with him at the reception? Then pick a song that he likes and dance with the man who has spent the last 20 years worth of time, money and emotional support to raise you.", "doesnt matter who the ass hole is. \n\nthis is one big ass sad story. \n\nkid loses dad, some man who falls in love with your mom comes to your life and from what i read enthusiastically takes on that monumental responsibility all willingly to be your dad (which I couldn't do, and many men refuse). unfortunately he's human and your just a kid both making mistakes and probably misunderstanding each other. your pain doesn't let you open up to this man who from what i read wanted to be there for you. what every you typed, with all the missing chapters. that man helped raise you, with all his mistakes. he was there.(as far as i know). and now your moving on from being their child to starting your own family and he can't symbolically open the door for you. I understand wanting that grandparent to walk you. but it still would hurt as hell. \n\n>When I told him my fiance and I were paying he offered to pay so he could \"give me away\"\n\nat face value, this sounds bad. but i have to believe that in the context of him raising you he really wanted this honor and i think he probably did not mean disrespect. \n\nThere are Zero rewards for what he did for the last 16 ish years and he could never compete with a ghost. \n\nim sorry if i sound mad at you. im really saddened from reading your story.", "At some point, you will get what you want, which is for this man to stop trying so damn hard to be a father to you. \n\nHonestly, I feel for him more than I feel for you. He\u2019s been trying to be there for you since you were four years old and you are attached to your childhood response of rejecting him. You are lucky that someone wants to be there for you and keeps trying despite you rejecting him. You seem to have little gratitude for his efforts or respect for the fact that he hasn\u2019t given up on his adopted child.", "Yta. Another ungrateful kid that never really grows up.\n\nSounds like someone was trying to love and offer help and guidance and you were to stuck on your own fairy tale world to move on", "NTA, but I do think it's sad that the ghost of a person you never knew owns such a huge piece of your heart.\n\nIm not saying let Jason in because he alienated himself- but the final part of grief is acceptance.", "NTA for having a close bond to your grandparents and not considering Jason your dad, but a bit YTA for how you treat him and for getting mad at him because he offered to pay for your wedding.\n\nYou do seem insensitive to his feelings. It absolutely does not mean that you should call him dad or let him walk you down the aisle, but it seems he is genuinely trying to be nice to you and you repay him with spite. If you told him something like \"that is very generous of you, Jason, and I very much appreciate it, but we have already decided to pay it ourselves, and have my grandma walk me down the aisle. We are happy you are going to be there, and we are looking forward to share our special day with you and mom.\", the result would still be the same (it would be your grandma and not him walking you down the isle), but it would be much more palatable for him.\n\nFrankly, if I were your stepparent, I would have stopped to invest my energy in you much earlier than Jason did. Not because you do not consider him your dad (that is your right and no one can dictate you that you should do it) but because you totally dismiss him as a person who seems to be genuinely trying to be nice to you.", "All the replies here demonstrate what many already knew: 95% of redditors have daddy issues.", "Nta\n\nBeing jealous of a dead person is always the weirdest thing to me", "NTA - him (and your mom) actively trying to separate you from your grandparents is enough proof that they are toxic. Stepdad doesn\u2019t deserve shit", "Oh hon! NTA at all! For any of it. Being considered a parent is a privilege, not a right. Jason and your mother were wrong to go through with an adoption against your wishes in the first place and the fact that Jason actively tried to replace your deceased father is just gross to me. Because why? You had the right to love your dad even if you barely knew him.", "Why should you give a damn about his feelings when he has clearly never cared about yours. NTA", "NTA. I hate parents that only care about their needs and desires. You get to decide who you consider and call dad, not your mom and step dad.", "This is the cutest AITA story. You NTA, and I would be lying if I didn't laugh cry at g-ma walking you into the next portion of your life. So yeah, your crying, not me.", "He also did a lot of things good fathers would never do. He tried to destroy her loving relationship with her grandparents. He was moody and mad when she referred to or talked about or had a picture of her bio dad. He made her responsible for his emotions and feelings of inferiority. He didn\u2019t give space for her grief. \n\nThat was his job too.", "He only offered to pay so he could give them away. He wasn't that nice when he refused to listen to them about wanting to be adopted. She didn't even get defensive till he said he'd pay for the wedding just cause he wants to be the one to give her away.", "Then why try to erase her father. He didn't choose to leave her, he died. Why couldn't stepdad have embraced the fact she had a loving father and paternal family instead of trying to assert his dominance as father.", "Good on you bud!", "We only have a child\u2019s recollection without any context. OP gets to have feelings about this, but without context it\u2019s foolish to judge this random guy who apparently has done everything a dad does. And newsflash: parents majorly screw up and do toxic stuff all the time, but a step-parent is supposed to somehow be perfect? Nah. Not enough info here and toxic double standard to boot.", "At 5 a child is not considered adult enough by a court of law to choose which parent they live with. So I\u2019m not sure why we\u2019d give them purview over other legal things. Perhaps mom was trying to move on, piece her family back together, and ensure her daughter was covered if the unthinkable happened. We just don\u2019t know the true situation except through the eyes of a 5-year old.", "May depend on age of the grandparents, did OP say?  and the existance of other relatives.  The main idea being to keep a kid out of foster care if something happens to the mom.  OP hasn't said anything about maternal relatives, don't know if they are not around or just not relevant to the story.", "See the thing is, there is no bond between a step parent and a five year old. It has to be developed. He doesn\u2019t have to be perfect, he has to be better than this though. Also you keep saying he\u2019s done everything a dad does. But, we don\u2019t actually know that at all. We do know he\u2019s done plenty of things that the adult human being is still bothered by. She\u2019s not a child and her feelings shouldn\u2019t be written off as being a child\u2019s recollection. Even actual children shouldn\u2019t be written off that easily.\n\nEdited to add: yeah. I\u2019ve reread the Op\u2019s post and comments. She describes her step dad as a person who hated others. Hated her dad\u2019s memory. He was the definition of a hateful person. Stop defending him.", "They actively sought to erase OP's father without regard for her feelings. They also tried to keep her paternal grandparents out of her life. Simply being a young child doesn't invalidate that child's feelings or memories. The acceptance they tried to force wasn't a healthy dynamic for OP. If Jason actually loved his stepdaughter, he would not have forced her to accept adoption and would have given the relationship time to develop in a natural way. They had one chance to get it right with the child and are shocked that the now adult doesn't return their \"feelings.\"", "They're so exhausting to be around. How can they be so nice yet not, all at the same time.\n\nI think they just fail spectacularly to be aware of others needs. So they compensate by having this shotgun approach to niceness.", "I think step dad would have gotten a lot further by respecting OPs connection to her father and reassuring her that he wasn\u2019t trying to take his place. By trying to make her feel guilty about keeping a connection and actually trying to replace him it obviously and predictably backfired spectacularly.", "Exactly. If you can't beat em, join em. He had no real competition bcuz bio dad was dead. So he should've encouraged a more open relationship that welcomed both men as father figures, instead of trying to force the idea that as the only living male, Jason is the 'real' father. He botched it stupendously.", "Why do people like your father even have kids? I'm glad you don't have to talk to him anymore.", "In some places, it is possible to undo an adoption. It's not easy, but it is possible.", "Teenage pregnancy, but still had more kids years later. \nI think having kids has been the norm for so long, too many people don't stop and think whether or not they actually should/want to have kids, they just do it because it's expected.", "Yes but why are you competing? If the mom and Jason had been less intense about having Jason be \"Dad\" it would have been way better for OP. He probably WOULD HAVE become dad if he had accepted OP's love for Bio Dad.\n\nOP states in the post that mom tried to cut off the gramps but they went to court. So the grandparents had to invoke grandparents rights just to see their grandchild cause the mom was the one trying to take her away from them. They could have just kept the same relationship but she was so desperate for Jason to be dad she tried to do something that really would have hurt OP.\n\nPlus, whatever relationship they could have had probably died the second he tried to buy OP. Why would he think that would work??", "Right. And us more enlightened, modern generation adults are somehow the abnormal, child-hating, monsters just because we made an informed, well-thought out choice to not have children"]}
