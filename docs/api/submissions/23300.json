He's not just an AH, he's a fool.", "NTA.   \nYou are not his mother, but he is a child.", "YTA. Yeah I get it, you reminded him multiple times and he forgot anyway, but it was petty and mean of you to do what you did. You're supposed to be partners. What did you gain by using this vacation as an excuse to teach him a lesson?\n\nI would guess this isn't the first time you've done something like this, and he's probably reconsidering whether he wants to stick around with some who acts this way.", "ESH. You're both acting like children. Grow up and learn to communicate in your marriage like functioning adults.", "NTA If he, a grown adult, forgets to pack his swim shorts even after being reminded several times it's his own fault. The fact that he's sulking about it and ruining his own vacation is just pathetic. Ignore him and have fun!", "You both acted like children. Just pack the darn suit for him when he forgets. Is the result worth your little dig at him?", "NTA. Serves him right, and not in a malicious way. My SO and I would actually find this hilarious on either side of it, and be willing to laugh at ourselves for being forgetful if either of us had been reminded explicitly 5 times. I think a lot of people who will comment here would feel the same way. This is something that should have been barely a two-minute conversation when you arrived, and certainly nowhere near a three-day tirade, wasting precious time with his family that he will most certainly regret missing (and likely blame you). *He's* ruining his vacation, not to mention everyone else's. This is a very unhealthy reaction to something so innocuous, and I honestly think the most productive way through this situation would be to use it as a starting point for a genuine conversation about how he would benefit from some therapy.", "NTA. My husband does the same thing. I remind him to bring some, he always forgets, but it\u2019s never my fault or something he throws a tantrum about. It usually turns into buying another set of trunks. He forgot once when we went to Palm Springs in September\u2026where we were staying at a little hotel with a pool in the center. It was beyond hot and miserable to not jump in the pool so he ended up with the shortest of swim trunks and we had a good laugh about how he had better be careful when he was in the water \ud83d\ude09", "YTA lol what a weird time to make a point. You're going on vacation. Be a good partner and help them out.", "NTA enjoy the holiday", "Nta your husband is acting like a child and I would be embarrassed to have to be around that behavior at this point.", "NTA. As you said, he had a habit of doing this so it's not like it's an honest mistake. He asked you to remind him, you did and he basically ignored you, but now needs someone to blame. His behavior shows he continually does this because he has you to take care of it, absolving him of the responsibility. I'm willing to bet this isn't the only thing he does it with. He's a grown man, and weaponized incompetence in regards to swim trunks is beyond ridiculous.", "ESH. Yes you reminded him 5 times but the fact that you saw he forgot them and didn\u2019t grab them for him is shitty. \n\nAt the very least you should have put them into your own bag and made him think he forgot them and had yourself a nice \u2018told ya so\u2019 moment. \n\nHe should grow up and stop being a baby but I can understand why he\u2019s annoyed with you. I don\u2019t think proving your point this was was worth it.", "YBA. Why wouldn't you just grab them? He shouldn't be a baby about it though.", "Well, that got deleted quick. Her user ID I mean.", "NTA \n\nwhat is he? five?", "Omg, haha. He's acting like a toddler, having a little tantrum. Does he do this often? NTA", "ESH except your FIL. You chose to be unhelpful out of spite and now your husband is sulking like a child. \n\nWhat lesson has anyone learned here? Would it have killed you to be kind? If you had just grabbed the shorts off the bed you\u2019d be the hero of the story. If your husband wasn\u2019t being a petulant little brat he could accept his father\u2019s kind offer and enjoy the beach *despite* your petty, pointless actions. \n\nBut instead everyone is miserable for no reason other than this is obviously what you both want.", "I guess if having each others back isn\u2019t part of your relationship, then NTA. But it seems mean to me. \n\nMy husband and I have been married 30years and together 34. We take care of each other so I truly don\u2019t get why you wouldn\u2019t just grab his swim suit when you saw it on the bed. Shoot you could have made a joke about it and put it on and ask him if he had everything he needed?  Marriage takes patience, humor, and grace. \n\nDo you like your husband?", "Congratulations. You big babies ruined his family's beach vacation. ESH", "ESH\n\nHe\u2019s ridiculous blaming you when you reminded him so many times, and he takes top AH points for concentrating his frustration on you instead of himself.\n\nYou saw them there and didn\u2019t grab them. You didn\u2019t have to, but this forum is not about whether or not you had to, it\u2019s about being an AH. You should have grabbed them, packed them with your own things, then produced them with a flourish when he realised he\u2019d forgotten. Or called out to him when you saw them - \u201cBabe, did you want the swim shorts or not? They\u2019re still on the bed.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't ruin his vacation since he said he'd take responsibility for his swimwear. He asked you to remind him and he still failed to remember when you did what he asked. He is an asshole for his reaction and ruining his own vacation when he probably could have bought swimwear nearby. But you were an asshole too because it doesn't take much effort to grab an article of clothing if you notice someone forgot it before a vacation trip. It simply would have been the kind thing to do and set a positive tone for the vacation, but you admit you left it because he didn't remember to pack it after your warnings.", "NTA He\u2019s a grown adult that is capable of reminding himself. You\u2019re definitely NTA since you reminded him multiple times. My husband and I have this rule when it comes to packing; I pack my stuff and he packs his. The only things we make sure the other has packed are passports/ID, credit cards, phones, medications. Anything that\u2019s been left behind can be bought wherever we are. Sure, it\u2019s inconvenient to buy new stuff but we\u2019ve accepted it as the reality of the situation. I use a special pillow for sleeping and I asked my husband to remind me to take it out of the dryer and pack it. He forgot. I remembered on the plane so we quickly ordered a new one to arrive at the place we\u2019d be staying. Thats all there was to it. No blaming each other or fighting. There\u2019s no reason for the husband to be a petulant 2 year old about it", "You do know they are \u201cshorts\u201d right? \n\nYou keep saying short. It\u2019s the same as \u201cpants\u201d. It\u2019s a pair of shorts or a pair of pants. You wouldn\u2019t say he forgot his pant, either", "NTA\n\nUnless he suffers from a condition that obliterates swim shorts from short term memory, erases all verbal reminders and requires babysitting, you have zero responsibility. What is WRONG with people. Let people fail. It\u2019s the only way they learn.", "Why didn\u2019t he put a sticky note on his suitcase or set a reminder in his phone? I\u2019m so sick of \u201chelpless\u201d adults.", "YTA\n\nYou were petty, because you were annoyed.", "YTA. Passive aggressive", "Pouty little man who throws tantrums and blames others for his own mistakes.", "NTA. He does know that he can write a list of things to remember to pack and even set a phone alarm to remind himself?\n\nEspecially if he himself knows that he's that forgetful?\n\nHas he ever heard of setting phone alarms (e.g. remember to bring shorts) and also writing notes in his phone to remind himself?\n\nBefore I go travelling, I always write a list of what I need to bring and tick them off as I pack them into my bag. And I set my phone alarms to remind myself (the day before travelling) to recheck that everything in the list is inside my bag. I'm quite a forgetful person and that helps me a lot.\n\nAnd also you mentioned you reminded him FIVE times? And he didn't think to grab his shorts immediately after you reminded him?\n\nSure, a reminder from others would be nice but realistically speaking, you can't rely on other people to remind you all the time.", "YTA. I get being annoyed at his forgetfulness, but this was pure spite.", "NTA; you reminded him five times and five times he failed to pack them. Then he blames you for not doing it for him, rather than accepting blame for the fact that he failed to do this himself five times? I have adhd and even I think that's ridiculous", "NTA. I know I\u2019m also very forgetful. Before I pack I make a checklist. I get everything ready to go ahead of time. Lastly I double check that I have everything I need. What I DON\u2019T do is make someone else responsible for thinking for me. You should be pushing back on him, reminding him of the 5 times you told him to not forget the shorts, which arguably you shouldn\u2019t have even done. You aren\u2019t his secretary or personal assistant. He has no right to be mad at anyone but himself.", "YTA; we all have shortcomings and you know this one about your husband and, even if it was in a small way, chose not to have his back. Marriage is a team effort not the Spite and Pettiness Olympics.", "NTA But next time don\u2019t admit to knowing  where he left him.", "ESH\nI get why you did it, he needs to be able to do things himself like an adult. It\u2019s frustrating to have to do something for someone after you\u2019ve reminded them many times. At the same time you saw the shorts were still there and didn\u2019t even mention it to him. In a relationship you have to look out for each other. By pointing out that you saw them, you made him realize you don\u2019t have his back, and might\u2019ve made him insecure about the fact that he didn\u2019t remember the shorts even after being reminded. He had another chance to be a mature adult and just wear his dad\u2019s trunks but didn\u2019t. So all in all you both ruined the trip for him (although him maybe a little more). I\u2019ve been in a similar situation", "Maybe against the grain here but YT.A. While he is responsible for his own clothes and packing, he simply forgot something that would only affect him. That\u2019s on him and he can only blame himself for that. \n\nYou are the AH because you purposefully didn\u2019t take 3 seconds to grab them when you saw them just to spite him. You knew he was going to leave them and you knew it would affect the vacation, yet you chose to be petty. Was proving that point worth it? Would you want him to do the same thing when you merely forget something in the future?\n\nETA: changed to ESH cause I forgot the husband is now pouting and refusing other reasonable solutions.", "NTA. We are assuming that your husband fits the description of \u201cGrown-ass man\u201d and is therefore responsible for his own damn self. There ain\u2019t no Walmart where y\u2019all at?", "YTA, you take them, but let him panic a bit before letting him know that you have them.", "NTA If you're visiting family near a beach, I am guessing their might be stores that sell swimming gear. So if he wants to pout like a petulant toddler who can't have a cookie because he forgot his swimsuit and doesn't want to buy one, oh well, not much you can about it.", "ESH So I'm saying this just because you saw them and could have grabbed them. Had you previously said something like \"i'm not reminding you again\" and then did this then it would all be on him. And even then its like 90/10 on him for acting like a baby about it.", "ESH. You were petty and mean to teach him a lesson. He weaponized his incompetence at packing, ignoring you five times. You deserve each other. You made it a hill to die on, now you will need to deal with the consequences.  And this behavior by both of you is clearly just the tip of the iceberg.", "Yep. I was feeling differently until I read his reaction.", "Oh we are, we're just a bit sad he's not with us", "Forgot the best part: they are neon orange", "I told him 5 times. I also had a heavy suitcase so my focus on the swin short was 2 seconds at most", "Pouting, staying in the room, and saying that she \"ruined his vacation\" too. Seriously wtf. \n\nNTA", "It happened once before", "I mean,despite it all, his family and me are having a pretty good time so it's not ruined for everyone", "She was kind when she reminded him five times.\n\nI have adhd and I can't imagine throwing a three day fit if I was told several times to pack X and I still failed to pack X. Doesn't matter if my spouse knew where X was, either I needed to ensure one of the five times that I packed the shorts, or I needed to take responsibility for the fact rhat I failed to five times.\n\nI just can't understand OP's husband being this childish", "My problem with all this is that would her Husband try to forget his stuff on purpose to have a shitty trip? Reading all the comments OP put out seems like she's just petty and did this to prove some shitty point about how he needs to listen to her and that he's lazy and blah blah blah. \n\nAlthough both are fucking children.", "OMG I love that! Put them on.", "No, like I said, me and his family are doing great", "Suspect this is a English as second language post. An easy mistake to make", "I do not care about the spelling of the word to be honest with you", "Me too! That was exactly my thought", "agreed. That was her only mistake. \u201cNo idea where they are. I remember reminding you, what did you do with them?\u201d", "He has multiplie options though. His father has swim short he can land him,there's stores close and i proposed to buy one for him. We can even easily go back home and take it. \n\nAs it happened before, I wouldn't care. If i forget something then the aftermath is on me.", "He's a grown man. Amazon exists. He could have a new swim short by the next day. The only thing 'affecting the vacation' is him.", "There are plenty of shops even but like i said, he refuses to go out at all and just stays inside", "Seriously baffling how grown people can fault others for their own behavior. Zero responsibility.", "Despite his childishness behavior, I hope he never forgets that you being right trumpets being kind to him. Hopefully it\u2019ll spur him to find a higher bar for a spouse.", "Damn. That\u2019s ice cold. \n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you- your husband is not going to change with regard to forgetting stuff. Sounds like basic ADHD. If you care about him you need to treat him better. \n\nHe absolutely needs to grow up / cut his losses / stop pouting, but your lack of self-reflection and lack of respect for him doesn\u2019t bode well for a healthy partnership.", "Well as long as you are having fun, who cares about his feelings. You punished him and that\u2019s what matters.", "Oh ya forgot that part, changed my judgement to account for his behavior after the fact too.", "He doesn\u2019t have ADHD, he only forgets his swim shorts when he has to get it. He\u2019s fine with everything else.", "Exactly so you weren\u2019t willing to help him out on this one? Because you know you\u2019re life partners"]}
