He's not just an AH, he's a fool.", "NTA.   \nYou are not his mother, but he is a child.", "YTA. Yeah I get it, you reminded him multiple times and he forgot anyway, but it was petty and mean of you to do what you did. You're supposed to be partners. What did you gain by using this vacation as an excuse to teach him a lesson?\n\nI would guess this isn't the first time you've done something like this, and he's probably reconsidering whether he wants to stick around with some who acts this way.", "ESH. You're both acting like children. Grow up and learn to communicate in your marriage like functioning adults.", "NTA If he, a grown adult, forgets to pack his swim shorts even after being reminded several times it's his own fault. The fact that he's sulking about it and ruining his own vacation is just pathetic. Ignore him and have fun!", "You both acted like children. Just pack the darn suit for him when he forgets. Is the result worth your little dig at him?", "NTA. Serves him right, and not in a malicious way. My SO and I would actually find this hilarious on either side of it, and be willing to laugh at ourselves for being forgetful if either of us had been reminded explicitly 5 times. I think a lot of people who will comment here would feel the same way. This is something that should have been barely a two-minute conversation when you arrived, and certainly nowhere near a three-day tirade, wasting precious time with his family that he will most certainly regret missing (and likely blame you). *He's* ruining his vacation, not to mention everyone else's. This is a very unhealthy reaction to something so innocuous, and I honestly think the most productive way through this situation would be to use it as a starting point for a genuine conversation about how he would benefit from some therapy.", "NTA. My husband does the same thing. I remind him to bring some, he always forgets, but it\u2019s never my fault or something he throws a tantrum about. It usually turns into buying another set of trunks. He forgot once when we went to Palm Springs in September\u2026where we were staying at a little hotel with a pool in the center. It was beyond hot and miserable to not jump in the pool so he ended up with the shortest of swim trunks and we had a good laugh about how he had better be careful when he was in the water \ud83d\ude09", "YTA lol what a weird time to make a point. You're going on vacation.

As you said, he had a habit of doing this so it's not like it's an honest mistake. He asked you to remind him, you did and he basically ignored you, but now needs someone to blame. His behavior shows he continually does this because he has you to take care of it, absolving him of the responsibility. I'm willing to bet this isn't the only thing he does it with. He's a grown man, and weaponized incompetence in regards to swim trunks is beyond ridiculous.", "ESH. Yes you reminded him 5 times but the fact that you saw he forgot them and didn\u2019t grab them for him is shitty. \n\nAt the very least you should have put them into your own bag and made him think he forgot them and had yourself a nice \u2018told ya so\u2019 moment. \n\nHe should grow up and stop being a baby but I can understand why he\u2019s annoyed with you. I don\u2019t think proving your point this was was worth it.", "YBA. Why wouldn't you just grab them? He shouldn't be a baby about it though.", "Well, that got deleted quick.

If you had just grabbed the shorts off the bed you\u2019d be the hero of the story.

We take care of each other so I truly don\u2019t get why you wouldn\u2019t just grab his swim suit when you saw it on the bed.

You didn't ruin his vacation since he said he'd take responsibility for his swimwear. He asked you to remind him and he still failed to remember when you did what he asked. He is an asshole for his reaction and ruining his own vacation when he probably could have bought swimwear nearby. But you were an asshole too because it doesn't take much effort to grab an article of clothing if you notice someone forgot it before a vacation trip. It simply would have been the kind thing to do and set a positive tone for the vacation, but you admit you left it because he didn't remember to pack it after your warnings.", "NTA He\u2019s a grown adult that is capable of reminding himself. You\u2019re definitely NTA since you reminded him multiple times. My husband and I have this rule when it comes to packing; I pack my stuff and he packs his. The only things we make sure the other has packed are passports/ID, credit cards, phones, medications. Anything that\u2019s been left behind can be bought wherever we are. Sure, it\u2019s inconvenient to buy new stuff but we\u2019ve accepted it as the reality of the situation. I use a special pillow for sleeping and I asked my husband to remind me to take it out of the dryer and pack it. He forgot. I remembered on the plane so we quickly ordered a new one to arrive at the place we\u2019d be staying. Thats all there was to it. No blaming each other or fighting. There\u2019s no reason for the husband to be a petulant 2 year old about it", "You do know they are \u201cshorts\u201d right? \n\nYou keep saying short. It\u2019s the same as \u201cpants\u201d. It\u2019s a pair of shorts or a pair of pants. You wouldn\u2019t say he forgot his pant, either", "NTA\n\nUnless he suffers from a condition that obliterates swim shorts from short term memory, erases all verbal reminders and requires babysitting, you have zero responsibility. What is WRONG with people. Let people fail. It\u2019s the only way they learn.", "Why didn\u2019t he put a sticky note on his suitcase or set a reminder in his phone? I\u2019m so sick of \u201chelpless\u201d adults.", "YTA\n\nYou were petty, because you were annoyed.", "YTA. Passive aggressive", "Pouty little man who throws tantrums and blames others for his own mistakes.", "NTA. He does know that he can write a list of things to remember to pack and even set a phone alarm to remind himself?\n\nEspecially if he himself knows that he's that forgetful?\n\nHas he ever heard of setting phone alarms (e.g. remember to bring shorts) and also writing notes in his phone to remind himself?\n\nBefore I go travelling, I always write a list of what I need to bring and tick them off as I pack them into my bag. And I set my phone alarms to remind myself (the day before travelling) to recheck that everything in the list is inside my bag. I'm quite a forgetful person and that helps me a lot.\n\nAnd also you mentioned you reminded him FIVE times? And he didn't think to grab his shorts immediately after you reminded him?\n\nSure, a reminder from others would be nice but realistically speaking, you can't rely on other people to remind you all the time.", "YTA. I get being annoyed at his forgetfulness, but this was pure spite.", "NTA; you reminded him five times and five times he failed to pack them. Then he blames you for not doing it for him, rather than accepting blame for the fact that he failed to do this himself five times? I have adhd and even I think that's ridiculous", "NTA. I know I\u2019m also very forgetful. Before I pack I make a checklist. I get everything ready to go ahead of time. Lastly I double check that I have everything I need. What I DON\u2019T do is make someone else responsible for thinking for me. You should be pushing back on him, reminding him of the 5 times you told him to not forget the shorts, which arguably you shouldn\u2019t have even done. You aren\u2019t his secretary or personal assistant. He has no right to be mad at anyone but himself.", "YTA; we all have shortcomings and you know this one about your husband and, even if it was in a small way, chose not to have his back. Marriage is a team effort not the Spite and Pettiness Olympics.", "NTA But next time don\u2019t admit to knowing  where he left him.", "ESH\nI get why you did it, he needs to be able to do things himself like an adult. It\u2019s frustrating to have to do something for someone after you\u2019ve reminded them many times. At the same time you saw the shorts were still there and didn\u2019t even mention it to him. In a relationship you have to look out for each other. By pointing out that you saw them, you made him realize you don\u2019t have his back, and might\u2019ve made him insecure about the fact that he didn\u2019t remember the shorts even after being reminded. He had another chance to be a mature adult and just wear his dad\u2019s trunks but didn\u2019t. So all in all you both ruined the trip for him (although him maybe a little more). I\u2019ve been in a similar situation", "Maybe against the grain here but YT.A. While he is responsible for his own clothes and packing, he simply forgot something that would only affect him. That\u2019s on him and he can only blame himself for that. \n\nYou are the AH because you purposefully didn\u2019t take 3 seconds to grab them when you saw them just to spite him. You knew he was going to leave them and you knew it would affect the vacation, yet you chose to be petty. Was proving that point worth it? Would you want him to do the same thing when you merely forget something in the future?\n\nETA: changed to ESH cause I forgot the husband is now pouting and refusing other reasonable solutions.", "NTA. We are assuming that your husband fits the description of \u201cGrown-ass man\u201d and is therefore responsible for his own damn self.

So if he wants to pout like a petulant toddler who can't have a cookie because he forgot his swimsuit and doesn't want to buy one, oh well, not much you can about it.", "ESH So I'm saying this just because you saw them and could have grabbed them. Had you previously said something like \"i'm not reminding you again\" and then did this then it would all be on him. And even then its like 90/10 on him for acting like a baby about it.", "ESH. You were petty and mean to teach him a lesson. He weaponized his incompetence at packing, ignoring you five times. You deserve each other. You made it a hill to die on, now you will need to deal with the consequences.  And this behavior by both of you is clearly just the tip of the iceberg.", "Yep.

Doesn't matter if my spouse knew where X was, either I needed to ensure one of the five times that I packed the shorts, or I needed to take responsibility for the fact rhat I failed to five times.\n\nI just can't understand OP's husband being this childish", "My problem with all this is that would her Husband try to forget his stuff on purpose to have a shitty trip? Reading all the comments OP put out seems like she's just petty and did this to prove some shitty point about how he needs to listen to her and that he's lazy and blah blah blah. \n\nAlthough both are fucking children.", "OMG I love that!

That was her only mistake. \u201cNo idea where they are. I remember reminding you, what did you do with them?\u201d", "He has multiplie options though. His father has swim short he can land him,there's stores close and i proposed to buy one for him. We can even easily go back home and take it. \n\nAs it happened before, I wouldn't care. If i forget something then the aftermath is on me.", "He's a grown man. Amazon exists. He could have a new swim short by the next day. The only thing 'affecting the vacation' is him.", "There are plenty of shops even but like i said, he refuses to go out at all and just stays inside", "Seriously baffling how grown people can fault others for their own behavior. Zero responsibility.", "Despite his childishness behavior, I hope he never forgets that you being right trumpets being kind to him. Hopefully it\u2019ll spur him to find a higher bar for a spouse.", "Damn. That\u2019s ice cold. \n\nI\u2019m gonna level with you- your husband is not going to change with regard to forgetting stuff. Sounds like basic ADHD. If you care about him you need to treat him better. \n\nHe absolutely needs to grow up / cut his losses / stop pouting, but your lack of self-reflection and lack of respect for him doesn\u2019t bode well for a healthy partnership.", "Well as long as you are having fun, who cares about his feelings. You punished him and that\u2019s what matters.", "Oh ya forgot that part, changed my judgement to account for his behavior after the fact too.", "He doesn\u2019t have ADHD, he only forgets his swim shorts when he has to get it. He\u2019s fine with everything else.", "Exactly so you weren\u2019t willing to help him out on this one? Because you know you\u2019re life partners", "NTA. He ruined his vacation for not being responsible for his own property, then throwing a three day tantrum. This is all on him. How he is feeling is on him. Don\u2019t let him get away with saying you ruined his vacation. He did it all himself, meanwhile you get to enjoy yourself :)", "YTA. I know you reminded him several times, but partners should help each other out. If i seen something that my wife obviously forgot i would pick it up and throw it in the bag no matter how many times i reminded her. You found a way to prove a point, and jumped on it rather than helping out someone you love. Its just petty, and not the way couples who function well act. You have bigger issues than a pair of swim shorts.", "NTA - but I would look at how my husband reacts with Argus\u2018 eyes. He throws that unreasonable long tantrum to train you to think for him next time and take his stuff, so that he does not has to think of this anymore.

Hubs is the AH for not doing better. OP is the AH too, I mean would it not kill her to just toss them into the suitcase?

It was as if you were annoyed or thought they were unnecessary - despite the fact that you asked me to remind you.

In the future, I want you to pack the thing you might forget first, so that this doesn\u2019t happen again. Also, I want to make it clear that even if I help you, it is 100% your responsibility to bring your stuff. And if I help you by reminding you, I want you to show some appreciation for my effort.

By going that route, he doesn\u2019t take any responsibility for what happened - as if you were responsible for making sure his stuff got packed. Now he is paying the price for being able to punish you. He is hoping that you will be deterred from punishing him in the future, because you\u2019ll not want to get a harder punishment in return. This can turn into a negative spiral where you just try to punish each other and both of you will be miserable.  \n\n\nIf you want your marriage to get out of the negative spiral, talk to each other.

It was more important that she felt some sort of good feeling on seeing him realise he'd forgotten them... and telling him 'yeah I knew you left them'  than she just acted like a normal caring partner that wanted to have fun with him more than anything else that trivial. She got a kick out of it, and for what?\n\nIf you did that to someone in your first few months of dating, that would be end of the line. To do it years into marriage says weird resentments and power plays are building up. His reaction says it's enough that he's now disconnecting from her completely and is probably sitting in that room thinking it's the end of the marriage and this was the last straw that broke the camels back. The priority should always be having a good time together, not getting one up on the other to make yourself feel good seeing them... not feel good. That's not a good relationship if you enjoy seeing them feel bad about something to teach them a lesson, rather than spending good quality time with them.\n\nThe husband is hurt that's what she thought would make her enjoy her time better, and so just doesn't want to go to beach with her period now. That's what his reaction is. It's not about the spare shorts, he's hurt and no longer wants to spend time with her. Which is exactly what she prioritised in the first place, feeling good when he realised he'd forgotten them instead of spending fun time together.  Now she's got what she wanted, and look how that's turned out. Not worth it over throwing a pair of shorts in front of you into a case, or just saying 'shorts are still on the bed silly\" just before they left. Not worth it at all.

Any psychologist or therapist taking to a couple is going to tell them that's not ok.\n\nThat's why he's not talking to her or borrowing shorts. He doesn't want to spend time with someone who does that to him. \n\nI'm not even kidding, I'd end any relationship there and then if someone showed me that's what they preferred the outcome to be. That they preferred seeing me feel bad and missing out, than having fun with me. Then expected me to not feel anything and just get on with it, and how they treated me was OK.\n\nThank god I've never in my life encountered anyone who preferred causing an issue and conflict, over just having a good time together.\n\nHe will 100% have 'ending that marriage' going through his head right now. He's not in a huff... he doesn't want to be with her and is choosing not to be. Because his wife just showed him, probably not for the first time, that she got a kick out of seeing him feel bad and missing out. Its more than just 'I forgot my shorts'. It's small regular things like this that lead to divorce. The resentments build up and it's stuff like this that does it.\n\nI would always always just want my partner to join in on everything and have a great time with him. I could care less if he's forgetful about something as daft as a pair of shorts. There's absolutely nothing inside me that would want to, or enjoy leaving them there deliberately to teach him a lesson. I don't care, I'd rather we had a good time together and he got to join in and not feed bad. He feels the same way, so shit like this never happens to us.", "no. but I would have been royally pissed off.

I would have handed them over and said that I was peacing out on further mommy role for a grown ass man. \n\nI dont enjoy my husband suffereing, but I am not using the same wet towel becaue he thinks it is my job. I work full time and contribute 50% of income to house. I am not letting my husband get away with making me responsibe for everything.

There's only so much \"doing their responsibility for them\" that a given person is going to deal with before they're done with the relationship.", "Yeah I guess so. It's just strange to see me because nobody has packed for me since I was a kid and I never forget stuff. I'm not married though.", "I can be quite distracted and forgetful, that's why I either make lists or pack the most important things first, and if I do forget something I'll either live without, borrow from someone I'm with (like DH could have here from his dad), or buy a new cheap/temporary replacement. I would not blame my partner for me forgetting to pack them despite them reminding 5 times. You know why? Because I realize I'm an adult and I can take responsibility for my own actions!", "The second part is not to sook like a baby for 3 whole days and ruin your whole vacation because YOU forgot something.", "OP mentioned in comments that he has acted like this before. The husband is just a toddler. The person you are responding to has written an entire book across multiple comments about OP and her husband and it is starting to get a bit weird.", "People are different. If she's acting like his mum and there's more going on in the relationship, that's probably where this has stemmed from.\n\nAt that point it's probably up to him to go see if he's got adhd or something that might be causing the regular forgetfulness. But it would be way better to talk about that constructively than start a conflict over it.\n\n My boyfriend leaves the hob and oven on all the time. I don't think he's doing it deliberately or wants to blow our house up or waste energy. In fact I actively know that he doesn't. So I know something else is going on in his head making this regular, because he feels terrible whenever I point it out.\nThat doesn't make me feel like his mum. He's an adult that clearly has a difficulty with remembering stuff and he's not just putting it on, or being lazy.\n\nDeliberately leaving those shorts and his reaction to it, says to me that as a couple, they have way more things going on in the background making them both react that way to begin with. And the only way to fix it is to go and talk to each other about how they feel, and why the others reaction makes them feel that way... and hopefully understand where the other is coming from and do something about it. Atm I'd guess he's too hurt to see that, because unfortunately high bursts of emotion causing hormones do that to you, they switch the logical part of your brain off. So I'd say in her situation I'd be the one to start the reach out for this one... particularly because it reads to me like she started this one rather than just telling him this was starting to wear on her.

All we know is that he was asked 5 times and failed to do this. He might have been preoccupied with other things.

Then is confused when he doesn't want to spend time with her.\n\nIt takes two people to have an argument. She started this one.\n\nThere could be any number of reasons he's forgetful. If you want the marriage to work and continue, you communicate if you're having an issue. Not try to teach the person you love a lesson, and get a kick out of seeing them feeling bad. That's mental.\n\nThere's a reason I've barely ever had a real argument in any of my relationships. It's because I talk about things that are starting to build up, rather than taking them out on the other in ways that damage our relationship.

The petty games damage both of you.", "Lots of people in here who think the wife leaving stuff deliberately to teach her husband a lesson is better than communication.\n\nAnd him feeling hurt by it and not wanting to spend time with her because of this, isn't justified and he shouldn't have feelings.\n\nA normal adult tells the other one if something is building up under the surface and frustrating them, doesn't try to play stupid games and hurt the other or make them miss out.\n\nIf you're at that point, communicate or break up. Because the stupid games damage both of you and the relationship. That's why half of marriages end in divorce now. It's not usually cheating or something huge that does it. It's these stupid games and resentments, building up until both people are doing this back and forth to the other one, until neither of you can deal with it anymore.\n\nI'm just glad I don't have pointless fights or nearly any in my relationships, and stuff like this never happens. Because we start a conversation before it ever gets to this point about \"Hey this has been starting to bother me a bit, could you try to work on it please?\" rather than ruin our own beach holiday together instead.
