For the most part his dog, a 1.5 year old golden doodle is sweet and overall a good pup. There are times however when his dog gets overly excited and goes a bit crazy and doesn\u2019t listen to commands. This happens after walks or when we\u2019re playing around with his toys. For reference I have my own dog, a 7 year old yorkie. So I\u2019m not unfamiliar to dogs or dislike them. I actually would prefer to hang out with my dog or others over people at times. However, I feel like my bf lacks any discipline towards his dog and will generally allow him to jump all over the couches and beds. \n\nThe problem is, I have really nice sheets and duvet cover from Parachute. A full set of sheets usually runs over $500. A few weeks ago I saw his dog on my bed scratching at the mattress. My fitted sheet was torn in two places. Each hole over a foot long. I expressed my frustration with my bf and told him to please keep his dog off my bed and sheets. He knows these are expensive because he thought about purchasing a set but decided not to. I did not ask to be reimbursed for the fitted sheet and brushed it off as aggravated as I was because I know that this comes with having a dog. \n\nFlash forward to this morning. We are sleeping and his dog needs to go out to the bathroom. My bf wakes up to walk the dog and I explicitly tell him to please make sure to wipe the dog down when he returns. Well as soon as he comes back and opens the door, his dog rushes into the bedroom, jumps on my bed and now there\u2019s mud on my duvet cover and fitted sheet which I just replaced. I am furious. All my bf says is \u201cOk we\u2019ll leave\u201d not even offering to help clean the sheets or anything. I am now on my second wash and the mud is not coming off the duvet cover. I feel like I have no other option but to charge him for the sheets and duvet cover. I think I am more upset at my bf for his lack of dog parenting and discipline. \n\nI also feel bad because he has a lot of expenses coming up with a move and a family vacation. But I just don\u2019t think he understands how upset I am that this keeps on happening. To top it off, I\u2019m supposed to sit his dog for a week while he\u2019s away on his family vacation.

He's refused to pay more than once and ignored reasonable requests to prevent damage. I think he's a future ex. NTA", "How attached are you to the boyfriend? I think beyond the cost of the sheets, there's a general lack of respect going on that seems pretty troubling. NTA.", "NTA Charge him! And he is a shitty dog owner. He let his dog destroy stuff and don't clean up the mud before he comes in other people houses. When he sees the dirt his dog caused, he just leaves. He don't take responsibility - he didn't offer to replace the destroyed sheets or clean up the dirt. I would ask myself if i really want to be in a relationship with him.\n\nBut get your money! Who cares if it will be hard moneywise for him. He could have kept a better eye on his dog. Or just train it! And why should you pay for it?", "Nta I don\u2019t think you three are compatible. He will probably always want to have his untrained dog around that destroys stuff and he won\u2019t really care. If he does prove he respects your stuff by replacing your expensive bedding, you should also get a set of cheaper ones just for when they\u2019re sleeping over to try to avoid this same thing happening again because it probably will.", "NTA. You could ask. My dog scratches bedding. I learned to keep an old blanket on top of the good stuff. Keep the bedroom door close when he's not being watched.", "NTA he needs to learn to train his dog and respect your wishes. It's not just about the sheets, he repeatedly ignored your instructions as well which led to this situation. You can wait to charge him until later but do not let this topic go unheard. It's important that he realizes that different things can be important for different people and you need to respect that if you genuinely care or love them.", "NTA. Time to talk to boyfriend. If does not understand your concerns - maybe time to rethink the relationship. He is not respecting you.", "nta. i would be livid too", "NTA. \n\nYou warned your boyfriend about the sheets and his dog potentially ruining them because your boyfriend doesn\u2019t make his dog behave. You said that this keeps happening. Your boyfriend should have listened to you and should have been more cautious about the situation and he also should have had more respect for you and your things. \n\nHowever, with that being said, things happen. Even if your boyfriend did everything right, dogs can still act up, no matter how trained. If he honestly did not take any precaution then he should replace your sheets. I don\u2019t think charging someone an astronomical amount for something they, themselves, cannot afford is the best hill to die on, but it\u2019s within your right since they didn\u2019t respect your things. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable for you not to want to watch his dog if the dog is misbehaving. You have a right to say no if the owner is not making the dog respect your boundaries. Even if he does have a lot of expenses, he cannot expect you to watch his dog which has been misbehaving and ruining your things. \n \n\nJust a piece of advice, if your boyfriend apologizes and is sincere, I would think about whether you want to charge him the full amount for what happened. It could lead to you both charging each other in the future for accidents or even silly mistakes that happen which could likely lead to resentment. Again, because he keeps doing this you are well within your right but this could also set a precedent that you are indebted to the other for any accidents that either of you cause that damages the other.", "ESH. Boyfriend needs to train the dog, and you need to take your head out your rear. Could\u2019ve been avoided by simply stating no dogs in the room/bed. \n\nAsking him to pay for the new sheets AND making him board the dog after you agreed to watch him - expect to be dumped.", ">I had already agreed to sit his dog for a week while he\u2019s on his family vacation.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here. Him for not managing his dog better, and you for backing out last minute as punishment.\n\nAs an aside, \"charging fees\" to any guest (who didn't already offer) is usually a nail in the coffin of the relationship.  Make sure you're OK with that.", "INFO needed. OP, does your dog sleep in the bed with you? If yes, it sounds like you just don't like big dogs. Which is your preference. However.....you need to make it clear THAT's the reason you don't want the dog in your home. \n\nI don't personally agree with spending $500 on sheets for a bed, but that's just me. You need to understand as long as you have more than 1 dog (or cats for that matter) in your home, there WILL be times where your sheets are going to be ruined for whatever reason. If I was you, I would either NOT spend money on sheets that you don't want to take a chance that a dog is going to ruin (because your precious little yorkie could do the same thing just by being sick) or just not let any animals in your bedroom.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

His dog is his responsibility and if the dog ruins something then it\u2019s his responsibility to replace it. If the dog is poorly behaved then it makes sense to not want to watch it but giving him no notice kinda sucks. It\u2019s going to he very hard for him to find a kennel for the dog last minute.", "NTA. Tell him to reimburse you for the destroyed bedding and the Doodle is no longer allowed to come over until BF actually bothers training him.", "I was reemed for saying I had expensive sheets on Reddit.

Charge him for the sheets and duvet but insist he board the dog the whole time and have it take him to obedience school.", "YWNBTA but I doubt you are actually going to get money from your bf given their reaction to the previous situation. Not too sure about the relationship either to be honest.  \n\n\nYou didn't ask for money for the ripped sheets but someone who cared their dog damaged your property and who cared about maintaining your relationship would have still offered. Maybe they can't afford the entire amount -- though they are going on vacation so it's not like they can't afford rent or food etc -- but they could have offered something, or to pay you back in installments. You might have refused to take the money, but it's the offer that's important.  \n\n\nAnd then walking away when you're upset because of the mud, and again not trying to make any amends, is a bad sign. Someone who cared about you and about your relationship would have aologized and offered to clean up. They wouldn't be upset because you're angry, because you have a right to be angry since you were explicit.   \n\n\nAnd I don't know why you would want to board your bf's dog while they are away on a vacation, regardless of this argument. Because you've pointed out how your bf doesn't discipline their dog  and this dog (sweet as it is most of the time) has already shown you that your things would be at risk if you weren't immediately watching them all the time. They jump up on couches or beds, if they get excited they might rip things, and you can't guarantee the dog won't track mud (or worse!) all over your house when you let them in.", "You WNBTA, if you did a lot of things:  charged him for the sheets and the duvet cover, asked him to board his dog for the entire week, refused to allow his dog back in your house until he paid for proper training ( and followed up with the training at home), refused to allow him back in your home is he will not come without his dog.

It\u2019s made for pet spots but it removes many other stains, vomit ( including red jello vomit from child with stomach virus) and the accident from new puppy ( stupid house guest gave 12 week old puppy a couple bites of lasagna!).
