I moved away immediately from home at 18 into college dorms. My college is only about 2 hours away, but in a different state. I usually come visit my parents every weekend if I\u2019m not working, and i come home for the summers.  Here\u2019s some background on my cat, Lucky. Lucky was a feral cat I rescued from our very wooded backyard, and I instantly grew attached to him. One of the hardest things I had to do was to leave him while I went off to college, but I knew it was best for him as he had already adjusted to my house and the other animals inside my house. Here\u2019s where the story starts. \n\nI was heading home on my two hour trek this weekend, and as I walked into my house, I instantly called for my cat Lucky. He usually comes running to me after entering the door, but today he did not do that. I looked quite literally everywhere. All of his favorite hiding places, his cat trees, my bed, literally everywhere. I then went to go ask my parents where he may be, and that\u2019s where I met my parents at the kitchen table looking upset and very guilty. Instantly I asked what was wrong, what happened, if everyone was okay, etc. My parents then proceeded to tell me that my cat, Lucky, has died earlier that week. Appalled, I asked why they had not called me, texted me, or even made a mention at any point. They told me it was a very hard conversation to have over the phone and that they didn\u2019t want to disrupt me during my \u201cbusy season\u201d. Instantly I was upset and I ended up balling while yelling at them. I was seriously so upset, especially because they know I would have dropped anything I was doing, to drive home and see him in his last few days. After I had calmed down a little bit, I asked what he had died of, and all they said was old age and that they didn\u2019t do an autopsy. That confused me because my cat was only 6 years old, and he hadn\u2019t had any previous health issues or concerns. Slowly I tried to accept the fact that he was gone, but then I had to ask the most important question. Did they cremate him? My parents knew I wanted him cremated so I could have a type of jewelry made, or just some type of memorial. It was very important to me that they listened to my wishes, but that idea went completely downhill when my parents looked at eachother, and then at me, and shook their heads. Now this would\u2019ve threw me over the edge, but as I went to leave out of anger, they yelled that it was just a joke and he\u2019s still here. Instead of walking back to them, i just walked out. As I went to drive around, I got an abundance of texts from both my parents asking me to come home. \n\nThey now are saying that I am petty and being soft. \n\nWhat do i do now? AITA for ghosting my parents and not coming home?", "created_utc": 1687888725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kkoj6/aita_for_refusing_to_return_home_from_college/", "score": 2123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm so sorry that your parents did such a horribly sadistic thing to you. This wasn't a prank. It was cruel and not remotely funny.

You've somehow turned out to be a compassionate person despite being raised by people who seem very lacking in empathy or compassion.", "NTA A joke is one thing, but what they did was intentionally cruel. You are not being petty and soft, they were AH's for thinking this was funny!! How would they like it if you pranked them by telling them someone they loved died?", "Your parents are seriously deranged.", "To repeat what I've often read here, a prank should not cause emotional or physical damage to the person being pranked.

Please take your cat back to college with you.", "Your parents are monsters. Genuinely. NTA. Can you find Lucky a home with friends or other family (if he is still actually under their roof)?", "Of course you're NTA and I don't know what kind of parents could do such a thing.  Have they always been cruel and abusive? There would be no forgiveness from me for something like that.", "You need to calmly speak to them like any other adults, not your parents. I find that when people do something unthinkably cruel and then be like \"It's only a joke!\" the best thing to do it stay entirely calm, and make them explain themselves. Calmly ask them what they thought, exactly, would be funny about their \"joke\"? Be like, \"You said I over-reacted and I'm willing to accept that it's possible. Maybe you can help me to understand what I\"m missing about this joke. How exactly was that prank funny? Was it funny when you watched me crying and in pain? Did you find it amusing when you saw me distraught? What part was the funniest to you exactly? Was it when I thought my cat was dead and I was heartbroken? Is it that part that made you laugh?\" Regardless of their reaction, you will have made your point.\n\nWhat they did was not a prank or a joke. It was very very cruel, and I would make it clear that if anything like that happens again, I just won't be coming home at all.  Any way you can take your cat to college?", "I need an update when OP confirms they have seen the cat alive", "NTA, and that was just plain CRUEL.", "NTA. Unethical tip: get a friend to call them, pretending to be campus security and say that you died. Then don\u2019t answer your phone. Tell them they\u2019re soft.", "NTA - Your parents are dicks. \n\nI recommend faking your own death in retaliation if they think it's so \"petty and soft\" that you're pissed at them for it. See how they like it.", "if you ghost your parents, you'll ghost your cat -- so naw. NTA for getting upset. they're idiots for thinking that was funny and worse, for calling you soft. WTF is that about.   \n\n\nIs it a goodbye forever moment?  I don't think so.  Reddit advice is all about people writing off family entirely, but that seems extreme unless there's so much toxicity there's no hope. Without knowing if they're consistenly awful, I'd say you should reach out to them.  (Or at least find another place to put the cat)", "NTA\nThat's a horrible way to treat a beloved pet. I would find out exactly where he is though, does seem like they rehomed him.", "NTA, sorry that happened to you, but also take a grain of salt when reading some of these comments when some are suggesting you destroy your relationship with your parents over this.", "edit: NTA. Sorry didn't even read til the end !! Cruel parents.\n\nYTA. Terrible situation you are in, but your parents were right to hide it from you.

I noticed you didn't mention them, and now I'm wondering if they got rid of all of them to rid themselves of the responsibility or if they got rid of Lucky because he was causing issues since you weren't home. My other guess is that they locked him away in a room before you got home so they could pull this \"joke\" and thankfully, he is still there.\n\nObviously, I'm speculating, and I have no idea what the truth is.  But this is where my thought process would go, especially since my parents have made it clear that they never wanted pets and they are our (siblings and my) responsibility.  They have offered to watch my dog while I'm on trips, and I would blow a gasket if I came back to them pulling something like this.\n\nI'd want proof he's alive.  I'd want proof he's at home.

It's a cat. An animal. You yelled at your parents over 'a dead cat that died of old age'.  I mean come on...are you not self aware. I'd be embarrassed as hell.\n\nGet an apartment that's pet friendly and take care of your own darn cat. Smh\n\n\nI think you should talk to your parents. Explain that what they did was not ok. Seriously talk about it. But you also should apologize to your parents for your uncouth behavior. Yelling and screaming over a cat that died of old age isn't rational. Not telling you until you arrived made sense (if this was a real situation. Your parents know you.

If you can arrange a few days off to coincide with moving him in that's going to be an excellent way to both spend time in the room to get him used to the idea of you and the room together being his new safe place, and also means you can leave just enough kibble out at all times so you can easily tell what's been taken. Talk to your vet about when to worry about water/food issues, as well - cats *can* refuse to eat for a few days when stressed, they generally will get back to routine but it is important to know what to look for. You can try bribes like wet food, temptations, lickums, but I've never run across a cat who was even remotely interested in them before they've called down enough to go back to regular eating.
