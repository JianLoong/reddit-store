{"id": 20752, "submission_id": "14kkoj6", "title": "AITA for refusing to return home from college after my parents pranked me with a situation involving my cat?", "selftext": "I (19F) am a student in college. I moved away immediately from home at 18 into college dorms. My college is only about 2 hours away, but in a different state. I usually come visit my parents every weekend if I\u2019m not working, and i come home for the summers.  Here\u2019s some background on my cat, Lucky. Lucky was a feral cat I rescued from our very wooded backyard, and I instantly grew attached to him. One of the hardest things I had to do was to leave him while I went off to college, but I knew it was best for him as he had already adjusted to my house and the other animals inside my house. Here\u2019s where the story starts. \n\nI was heading home on my two hour trek this weekend, and as I walked into my house, I instantly called for my cat Lucky. He usually comes running to me after entering the door, but today he did not do that. I looked quite literally everywhere. All of his favorite hiding places, his cat trees, my bed, literally everywhere. I then went to go ask my parents where he may be, and that\u2019s where I met my parents at the kitchen table looking upset and very guilty. Instantly I asked what was wrong, what happened, if everyone was okay, etc. My parents then proceeded to tell me that my cat, Lucky, has died earlier that week. Appalled, I asked why they had not called me, texted me, or even made a mention at any point. They told me it was a very hard conversation to have over the phone and that they didn\u2019t want to disrupt me during my \u201cbusy season\u201d. Instantly I was upset and I ended up balling while yelling at them. I was seriously so upset, especially because they know I would have dropped anything I was doing, to drive home and see him in his last few days. After I had calmed down a little bit, I asked what he had died of, and all they said was old age and that they didn\u2019t do an autopsy. That confused me because my cat was only 6 years old, and he hadn\u2019t had any previous health issues or concerns. Slowly I tried to accept the fact that he was gone, but then I had to ask the most important question. Did they cremate him? My parents knew I wanted him cremated so I could have a type of jewelry made, or just some type of memorial. It was very important to me that they listened to my wishes, but that idea went completely downhill when my parents looked at eachother, and then at me, and shook their heads. Now this would\u2019ve threw me over the edge, but as I went to leave out of anger, they yelled that it was just a joke and he\u2019s still here. Instead of walking back to them, i just walked out. As I went to drive around, I got an abundance of texts from both my parents asking me to come home. \n\nThey now are saying that I am petty and being soft. \n\nWhat do i do now? AITA for ghosting my parents and not coming home?", "created_utc": 1687888725, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kkoj6/aita_for_refusing_to_return_home_from_college/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is wrong with your parents? That's not a prank. They let you believe a pet you love is dead and watched you cry.

That is a job that takes time and effort every day.

I'm so sorry that your parents did such a horribly sadistic thing to you. This wasn't a prank. It was cruel and not remotely funny.

You've somehow turned out to be a compassionate person despite being raised by people who seem very lacking in empathy or compassion.", "NTA A joke is one thing, but what they did was intentionally cruel. You are not being petty and soft, they were AH's for thinking this was funny!! How would they like it if you pranked them by telling them someone they loved died?", "Your parents are seriously deranged.", "To repeat what I've often read here, a prank should not cause emotional or physical damage to the person being pranked. Everybody should end up laughing. Your parents behavior was horrible. NTA", "NTA. I don't know if your parents are stupid or evil.", "This was not AT ALL funny!  Please take your cat back to college with you.", "Your parents are monsters. Genuinely. NTA. Can you find Lucky a home with friends or other family (if he is still actually under their roof)?", "Of course you're NTA and I don't know what kind of parents could do such a thing.  Have they always been cruel and abusive? There would be no forgiveness from me for something like that.", "You need to calmly speak to them like any other adults, not your parents. I find that when people do something unthinkably cruel and then be like \"It's only a joke!\" the best thing to do it stay entirely calm, and make them explain themselves. Calmly ask them what they thought, exactly, would be funny about their \"joke\"? Be like, \"You said I over-reacted and I'm willing to accept that it's possible. Maybe you can help me to understand what I\"m missing about this joke. How exactly was that prank funny? Was it funny when you watched me crying and in pain? Did you find it amusing when you saw me distraught? What part was the funniest to you exactly? Was it when I thought my cat was dead and I was heartbroken? Is it that part that made you laugh?\" Regardless of their reaction, you will have made your point.\n\nWhat they did was not a prank or a joke. It was very very cruel, and I would make it clear that if anything like that happens again, I just won't be coming home at all.  Any way you can take your cat to college?", "I need an update when OP confirms they have seen the cat alive", "NTA, and that was just plain CRUEL.", "NTA. Unethical tip: get a friend to call them, pretending to be campus security and say that you died. Then don\u2019t answer your phone. Tell them they\u2019re soft.", "NTA - Your parents are dicks. \n\nI recommend faking your own death in retaliation if they think it's so \"petty and soft\" that you're pissed at them for it. See how they like it.", "if you ghost your parents, you'll ghost your cat -- so naw. NTA for getting upset. they're idiots for thinking that was funny and worse, for calling you soft. WTF is that about.   \n\n\nIs it a goodbye forever moment?  I don't think so.  Reddit advice is all about people writing off family entirely, but that seems extreme unless there's so much toxicity there's no hope. Without knowing if they're consistenly awful, I'd say you should reach out to them.  (Or at least find another place to put the cat)", "NTA\nThat's a horrible way to treat a beloved pet. I would find out exactly where he is though, does seem like they rehomed him.", "NTA, sorry that happened to you, but also take a grain of salt when reading some of these comments when some are suggesting you destroy your relationship with your parents over this.", "edit: NTA. Sorry didn't even read til the end !! Cruel parents.\n\nYTA. Terrible situation you are in, but your parents were right to hide it from you.
