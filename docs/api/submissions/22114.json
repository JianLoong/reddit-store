Right now, his son (will call him CJ - 12M) is staying with us for the summer. \n\nCJ has a rather odd relationship in regards to food. If he decides he doesn't like it (even without trying it) he rather starve himself. It's like his mom and grandma (who he normally lives with) introduced to him to like 3 foods and gave up introducing him to anything after that. If he is hungry at home, his mom or grandma drop whatever they are doing, to make him one of the 3 meals. \n\nHowever, at my house, when I make dinner, I make one dinner. Usually because I make everything from scratch, or close to from scratch, and it takes me longer than I care to admit. By the time I am done, I usually have no energy or am too hot to make something else entirely. But if someone doesn't like my meal, I always tell them **they are welcome to make themselves something else.** \n\n16M is your typical teen boy and will eat anything under the sun. 12F is always willing to try what I make, but if she really doesn't like it, she has no issue making herself a sandwich.\n\nNot CJ though. CJ will look at the meal, having never tried it, and demand I make him something else. First time, I told him he is welcome to make himself some chicken nuggets in the microwave. Told me he doesn't know how. So I have showed him, no less than 3 times, how to microwave his chicken nuggets. Everytime he has come up with excuse, usually to the tune of \"I forgot how.\" \n\nOur microwave isn't complicated it. Put food in, push the correct numbers for the time, hit start. Fourth time he told me he couldn't do it, I told him to figure it out. He hit me with, \"Its not my job. Making food is a girl's job.\" I told him he can treat his mom and grandma like his personal slave, but in MY house, I am no one's slave and said I will not be helping him anymore in the future. \n\nCourse his dad - my partner - heard him say that and had a very different approach on the whole matter. He told CJ he is no longer allowed to have a different meal at all and that he has to try whatever is made for dinner because its not okay to treat other's (especially women) like that. \n\nFor the most part, CJ has liked about 75% of whatever I make for dinner. However, the nights I make something \"new to him\" he'll straight up refuse to try it and will sit there for 2 hours before even trying it, where by that time, food is cold and meh. His dad refuses to let him up from the table until he eats at least half of anything (and I only give the kid a toddler size portion, so it's like 2 normal bites, 5 toddler size bites. CJ eats by taking smaller-than-toddler bites.) \n\nSo am I an asshole for no longer helping him make a whole different meal? Most of my meals are pretty normal. Spaghetti and meatballs. Steak and potatoes, chicken and noodles. \"Weirdest\" thing I could have possibly made was gyros.

I'm very glad his dad is taking the lead on this and not just leaving you to parent his kid for him. I guarantee that in future, he will credit his opening up to different foods to the lovely meals you make.

At that age a child should be able to make a sandwich, cook chicken nuggets, even make some little more complicated meals. If he ever makes the comment that cooking is ''a girl's job'', I suggest you tell him that actually it is a basic life skill, not a gendered skill.", "NTA - Weaponized incompetence. He's so used to being catered to that it's become what he expects. He's more than old enough to be able to make himself something.", "NTA, and I\u2019m glad your husband also sees things your way.

But, you're not going to undo 12 years of taught behavior overnight.\n\nI would do what his dad recommends, since that's his kid.

So, his dad can work on changing those.\n\nIf he likes 75% of what you make, then he's not going to starve.", "NTA. You're not going to be doing this kid any favours to give in. Plus, his mom and grandma already seem to have that covered, lol. You need to show him another way of being. Good luck.", "NTA but talk to his dad about the keeping him at the table thing. I don't think that's recommended for toddlers, let alone tweens - better to just let him go hungry a couple nights until he figures out how to cook for himself. \n\nYou could also try family cooking nights to transition the kids into cooking one night a week each. Would ease the burden for you and set them up with skills for life! If it gets fun enough even the picky eater could come around, maybe. Good luck!", "NTA.  A 12 year old should know how to fix something in a microwave.  You showed him, he insists on being helpless, so he can go hungry.  Fixing a 2nd meal is not your job.\n\nGood for your husband for backing you up.  I'm not sure about not allowing the boy to fix himself something else if he doesn't like the food, but I \\*am\\* sure that the boy shouldn't have to sit at the table staring at food he doesn't want for a couple of hours.  Let him refuse the food and go hungry.  When he's hungry enough, he'll eat what's put in front of him - or he'll learn to work that microwave.", "NTA It's a good thing his father is standing firm and not putting up with his attitude.", "NTA", "NTA, and stick up for his father because he is doing a good thing and he stuck up for you when he heard CJ.", "NTA HOWEVER I don't at all agree with your husband. Yes, CJ should have to take a bite (a decent bite) of whatever you make. But if he doesn't like it, he should be allowed to make himself something else. That's actually teaching him self sufficiency, and I would aruge is a more important lesson.", "NTA. You are providing him with a healthful meal. He is choosing not to eat it. I think allowing him the same alternative as your other kids, that of making his own meal, is an acceptable alternative.", "Refreshing to finally hear about a supportive partner on Reddit for once", "NTA - he sounds horrible.", "NTA. My parents had a few rules regarding food growing up (no neurodivergent issues, and I have an allergy that was already accounted for and doesn't count towards the rules): \n\n1) you get to completely dislike 3 things. That's it. You can refuse to eat those 3 things. If you find a 4th, one of the first 3 has to be swapped out. (for me, it was scrambled eggs, cabbage, and usually rutabaga, but mostly just the first 2. I still hate them.) \n\n2) you have two options for dinner: eat it or go hungry. Refusal to at least make a good faith effort to eat will result in the leftovers being breakfast (stored and reheated appropriately, it wasn't like, left out all night). \n\n2.5) if you get leftovers for breakfast, be assured your siblings is getting pancakes or waffles or something else you'll be very jealous of. \n\n3) the family eats together\n\nNow, if they decided to try something completely new or off the wall, the rules relaxed a bit.

Yeah, just had to eat them.", "NTA, but what the hell are his bio parents doing not addressing and resolving this. \n\nFrom personal experience it's is hellish to resolve but with time and consistency you can get there", "NTA your way was nice, and he should have just microwaved his own nuggets.

When they whine, you tell them it's only a spoonful and you need to try it. When they're hungry enough, they'll eat, and if they refuse your meal, don't get up from the table. Just tell them well, you know where the bread and peanut butter is, and continue eating.", "INFO:\n\nI don't understand where the conflict is here? \n\nYou have a picky 12 year old, a father trying to correct the picky-ness, and a stepmother making apparently normal and edible meals.
