Right now, his son (will call him CJ - 12M) is staying with us for the summer. \n\nCJ has a rather odd relationship in regards to food. If he decides he doesn't like it (even without trying it) he rather starve himself. It's like his mom and grandma (who he normally lives with) introduced to him to like 3 foods and gave up introducing him to anything after that. If he is hungry at home, his mom or grandma drop whatever they are doing, to make him one of the 3 meals. \n\nHowever, at my house, when I make dinner, I make one dinner. Usually because I make everything from scratch, or close to from scratch, and it takes me longer than I care to admit. By the time I am done, I usually have no energy or am too hot to make something else entirely. But if someone doesn't like my meal, I always tell them **they are welcome to make themselves something else.** \n\n16M is your typical teen boy and will eat anything under the sun. 12F is always willing to try what I make, but if she really doesn't like it, she has no issue making herself a sandwich.\n\nNot CJ though. CJ will look at the meal, having never tried it, and demand I make him something else. First time, I told him he is welcome to make himself some chicken nuggets in the microwave. Told me he doesn't know how. So I have showed him, no less than 3 times, how to microwave his chicken nuggets. Everytime he has come up with excuse, usually to the tune of \"I forgot how.\" \n\nOur microwave isn't complicated it. Put food in, push the correct numbers for the time, hit start. Fourth time he told me he couldn't do it, I told him to figure it out. He hit me with, \"Its not my job. Making food is a girl's job.\" I told him he can treat his mom and grandma like his personal slave, but in MY house, I am no one's slave and said I will not be helping him anymore in the future. \n\nCourse his dad - my partner - heard him say that and had a very different approach on the whole matter. He told CJ he is no longer allowed to have a different meal at all and that he has to try whatever is made for dinner because its not okay to treat other's (especially women) like that. \n\nFor the most part, CJ has liked about 75% of whatever I make for dinner. However, the nights I make something \"new to him\" he'll straight up refuse to try it and will sit there for 2 hours before even trying it, where by that time, food is cold and meh. His dad refuses to let him up from the table until he eats at least half of anything (and I only give the kid a toddler size portion, so it's like 2 normal bites, 5 toddler size bites. CJ eats by taking smaller-than-toddler bites.) \n\nSo am I an asshole for no longer helping him make a whole different meal? Most of my meals are pretty normal. Spaghetti and meatballs. Steak and potatoes, chicken and noodles. \"Weirdest\" thing I could have possibly made was gyros.

If he refuses to make his own food, fine, he doesn\u2019t eat. But forcing him to eat food he doesn\u2019t want to eat is a recipe for an unhealthy relationship with food, and honestly a bad relationship with the person forcing him to eat it (and I know his mom is already doing this, but that doesn\u2019t make it cool for your husband to make it worse).\n\nEDIT: also, I definitely don\u2019t feel like this is the best way to address his misogyny. He needs to understand why what he said was wrong, and this doesn\u2019t teach him that at all.\n\n\nEDIT: this isn\u2019t just a personal opinion either. \n\n[Source](https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/education/mealtime-atmosphere-and-eating-behavior#:~:text=Forcing%20children%20to%20eat%20reinforces,when%20they're%20already%20full.)\n\n[Source](https://www.newsweek.com/why-parents-shouldnt-force-food-picky-children-according-new-study-1044934#:~:text=The%20findings%2C%20published%20in%20the,damage%20the%20parent%2Dchild%20relationship.)\n\n[Source](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/raising-healthy-eaters-should-kids-clean-their-plate)\n\n[Source](https://amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/31/shouldnt-force-children-eat-greens)\n\n[Source](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/parenting-your-preschooler/201403/should-you-force-kids-eat-their-broccoli?amp)", "Agreed. I grew up with weird food situations like this\u2014 I was picky when I was younger, but a lot of foods actually made me feel nauseous for some reason. My dad and the babysitter my mom took me to didn\u2019t care that I actually felt sick and they still regularly forced me to eat foods that I didn\u2019t like and told me to clear my plate before I could leave the table. \n\nGuess who has a fucked up relationship with food that they\u2019re still trying to sort out at 31? This guy. \n\nDon\u2019t force your kids to eat foods they don\u2019t like. Make them their dinner, teach them how to make the food they do like, and give them the option to make their own food when they really don\u2019t want to eat what you\u2019ve made.
