You've broken your family by being judgmental.  If you're ok with that then fine.  But don't expect your family to show you any more respect than you show them.", "So without focusing on my opinions of the backstory, just the question in the title:\n\nSo the 22 and 18 year olds were living with you with the support that comes along (I'm assuming no rent/utilities/food/laundry bills). They were also working, with that money going to their older brother/niece.  When you found out where their money went, you decided to cut them off so they moved out.\n\nYeah, I'm going with YTA. It doesn't sound like you have a single problem with them making/spending money, but you care that it goes to your oldest son and his daughter. Why should that matter to you?\n\nProbably best that I leave out my opinions on the rest of the story, you definitely wouldn't like that.", "YTA \n\nBTW, they didn't use you. You wrote:\n\n>You see my youngest kids still lived at home and I financially supported them so they could focus on their studies but for some unknown reason they insisted on having part time jobs.\n\nSo it's not like they took your money and gave it to their niece. They didn't have to work and they decided to do it solely to help their brother. You didn't lose any money. They used cash they earned without you. If they didn't help, they wouldn't work and your financial situation would be the same.\n\nYour problem is control. You chose a path for your son and you got angry when he decided to take another way, so you punished him. Now you're trying to do the same with your other kids. You decided how they should behave and punished them when they refuse. And it looks like you can do nothing to hurt them but keep your money... That's just sad.", "YTA....they are only bad decisions because you don't agree with them. So he got a girl pregnant. At least he stepped up and is taking care of her instead of being a deadbeat dad.  \nYour other children care for their sibling. They got part time jobs and are sending their money to help him out. And instead of being proud of them, you're angry.  \nYou still have to support the 17yr old until they are at least 18. And then you get to \"spend your money on yourself\" like you want.  \nBut be prepared for the fallout that may come from your behaviors and the NC that will probably happen with the rest of your children because you think having a kid at 18 and \"only being a chef\" is disappointing.", ">He was a very smart boy who was going to become a lawyer but now **he is just a chef** because he couldn't go to college.\n\nJust a chef? Just a chef. Christ almighty.\n\nLet me explain something to you. Every chef I have ever known, and there have been a lot, has been one the most passionate, hardworking, creative people I have ever met. Every lawyer on the other hand? Let\u2019s not get into that.\n\nYTA\n\nETA: Get ready to lose all your kids. Somehow, and I don\u2019t know how, these people ended up generous and loving. They did not get that from you. I guess miracles do happen.", "YTA\n\nMy, aren't you a gem.

From the moment that you chose to not support his decision to parent his child. Did you ever talk to him about how he could go to college and parent his child at the same time? It\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s possible \u2014 especially if he had family support. But you cut off that support.  \n\nAlso, elitist much? It takes a lot of hard work to become a chef. Chefs lead the culinary team. They are managers. They make art and they nourish us.", "YTA\n\n>I chose not to support his decision to keep the baby and run his own life.\n\nSince the decision to keep the baby was ultimately the mother's, what you're really saying here is that you think your son should've abandoned them both and become a deadbeat father. Classy. \n\n>They went behind my back and used me for my money.\n\nIf they had been giving money to anyone else from their part-time jobs, would you have reacted the same way? Be honest.\n\nYou turned your back on your eldest for no reason beyond your own snobbish disdain for his choices and expected your other children to follow suit. Thankfully they have seen through your bullshit and have chosen to live with a person who is a far better parent than you can ever hope to be.\n\nEnjoy the rest of your life alone, I guess.", "This gotta be bait-", "YTA. You might want to check with a medical professional to see if you are a narcissist or some other mental issue. You abandoned your oldest kid and or mad at your other kids for helping their older sibling.", "YTA\n\nI've been in this sub for a while and have seen this type of situation enough times that I'm pretty sure I can read between the lines of your post. Let's start. \n\n1. You're mad that your son decided to step up as a dad as opposed to being the prestigious lawyer that you could brag about. He went NC.\n\n2. You finally decided to meet your grandchild and decided she was rude/spoiled. I'm guessing she didn't immediately accept your authority as her grandmother. You didn't like that, probably insulted her or your son's parenting to his face, and he rightfully cut you off again. \n\n3. The other kids are trying to be doting aunts/uncles. That's why you're really upset. You had no issue supporting them **until** you found out they were gifting stuff to your grandchild **with their money from their jobs**. They basically picked up the slack for you since you're NC with her dad. \n\nLook. Support your kids or don't. It's your money. However, you're burning a lot of bridges and it won't be long before all of your kids are NC with you. It'll be your bad decisions that lead to that outcome.", "So your eldest decided to take responsibility for his actions and raise his daughter, started a career as a chef (which is VERY respectable, \u2018just a chef\u2019, really?) to support her, and his siblings are going out of their way to financially support their brother and niece so she can attend a better school, which in your mind is \u201cspoiling her\u201d. \n\nHow did you even manage to type this out without realizing YTA? I also think it\u2019s very telling that you never refer to your eldest\u2019s child as your granddaughter.", "YTA.\n\nfirst for trying to force your oldest to get rid of his child. HE and the mother decided to keep her, so you have no say in that. the fact that you offered no support despite his decision is downright cruel.\n\nhis siblings care about him. they got part time jobs because they wanted to show support and help their older brother. that's THEIR decision to make. not yours. stop trying to control everything in your kids lives.", "YTA, just like everybody else said, because:\n\n1. how could you not help your own granddaughter to begin with?\n2. how could you resent your eldest for keeping his child?\n3. how could you have anything to say against those wonderful kids, who decided to help their brother raise his child?\n\nDespite your rampant self-centeredness, you raised wonderful kids. Now, leave them alone. It might come as a surprise to you, but the world doesn't revolve around what you want. Your children selflessly chose their family, their daughter/nice, and their siblings over you. Do you still wonder why?", "YTA.\n\nIt's one thing to not be happy with your son's decisions, another being an ass because he chose a different life than you expected. 10 years later you finally meet your grandchild and the first thing you do is criticize his parenting. That alone makes you an asshole.\n\nBut then, when you find out that your other kids are good brothers who work to give their niece a better life, you get angry instead of proud? This are KIDS that are working when they don't have to, out of selflessness. You are truly a gigantic asshole and you deserve to be alone.", "YTA, congratulations none your children want anything to do with you", "YTA, and you\u2019ve been TA from the jump, which is why all of your kids treat you like they do.", "So your oldest went NC, and two out of the three you have left decided to move in with the oldest rather than stay with you... does none of this indicate anything to you? That perhaps you might be in the wrong here? \n\nHave fun growing old alone, I guess, because that's where you're headed. YTA.", "Wait? You never met your grandchild? And after 10 years, you judge the child to be a failed experiment in your son's ability to adult?\n\nSorry. YTA. If you didn't help in any way then do no harm and don't complain. \n\nYour kids conspired against you? As wrong of them as I believe this was - I don't much blame them. I come from a pretty traditional background myself. But, my parents were never intolerant. They did not shun us into being better people.\n\nYou get what you give as far as love is concerned. Don't be angry that what you put out - you got back.", "Big YTA\n\nFirst, \u201cJust a chef\u201d is highly regarded as discrimination. Stop from saying these type of things now or never. If you keep on saying this elsewhere then you will get serious consequences from your action. What you have said is equal to chefs are stupid and mothers like you are not suppose to say that.\n\nSecond, your oldest are 28, she has a job with her 10 years old daughter. She\u2019s legally mature and you are her grandma. You have no responsibility about take care of her as her legal parents are your son and her husband and they are persons who decide to receive advices or helpings by themselves.", "Y\u2019all she keeps posting about this.

This is a NORMAL and totally acceptable way to spend their discretionary income. Also, lumping in a better education with \"unnecessary things\" is wrong. \n\nYour first encounter with a 10 yr old girl is to say she's rude. She's probably asked about her grandparents and to hear that her dad was kicked out of his home because of her existence, will mean you have a hard hill to climb for the child to be nice to you. Her peers have grandparents who love and support them emotionally and are present in their lives. But because you disagree with your son, an adult and a parent, you went no contact.  And after one encounter with a CHILD, you went no contact again. What did you expect? No one to hold you accountable for abandoning your son when he needed you most?\n\nIf the kids wanted to get part time jobs it's because they wanted spending money you didn't control. You are required to provide food, clothing, shelter and education to your kids as a MINIMUM. \n\nBeing a chef is not a bad job, it's a hard job.", "YTA\n\n> I chose not to support his decision to keep the baby and run his own life\n\nWhy the fuck wouldn\u2019t you support him? He wasn\u2019t hurting anyone, he made a choice that was right for him.\n\n> He was a very smart boy who was going to become a lawyer but now he is just a chef because he couldn't go to college.\n\nThere is no guarantee he would have become a lawyer; it\u2019s not uncommon for young adults to change directions after a year or two in college (and after taking some classes to prepare them for that specific field.) Most 18yo\u2019s do not have the resources to put themselves through college - they need parental support.\n\nWhat\u2019s unclear is if you withdrew that support, or he made the decision to not go to college in order to support his baby. But I\u2019d be remiss it not pointing out you could have helped support him with a baby so he could go to college.\n\nAlso there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a chef, you\u2019re coming across as classist. \n\n> I met the kid for the first time and she was extremely rude and spoiled\n\nYou don\u2019t provide any specific examples, just a label.\n\n> I didn't approve of his parenting which resulted in him going NC again\n\nOR, you are trying to stick your nose in where it doesn\u2019t belong because you think you know better than your son, and he has no interest in exposing himself to someone who puts him down - from his career choice to his parenting.\n\n> You see my youngest kids still lived at home and I financially supported them\n\nAs you should, you\u2019re not going to get any points for this especially when one is 18 and the other is a minor. Financially supporting them is your responsibility as a parent.\n\nEven 22 is still pretty damn young.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker - you were fine with them having money for themselves until you didn\u2019t like what they spent the money on.\n\nThe absolute horror that uncles want to gift their neice a nice thing, and help provide her with a better education.\n\nThe astounding thing is that while you seem to be a controlling, judgemental parent, you have raised four wonderful children *who will look out for each other*.\n\nAnd isn\u2019t that the ultimate goal?\n\nIt\u2019s just too bad they have to look out from each other from you.", "IDK you come off as someone who has a victim mentality.

A huge gaping one for this alone:\n\n>he is just a chef\n\nAs a foodie - shame on you.  People in the restaurant business do it because they love it - it's an incredibly hard work/life balancing act, especially with a child.  It's also incredibly rewarding.  I applaud your son for making something of himself despite having a parent like you.  I'm honestly surprised your other children grew up to be kind, loving aunts/uncles to their nibling in spite of you.", "Easy YTA", "YTA your children didn't use your money. They choose to work to help their brother to give their niece a good life. They doesn't use your money, they doesn't rob you or use you.\n\nYou did the bare minimum - provide underage children necessaries. That's your job - not more. Would you've been made if they used their money for make-up, clothes anything else? I bet not.

Seriously, I'd be so proud if I had kids who acted like that. \n\nNoone 'used' you. You have children who, by some miracle, have grown up into decent and responsible adults. It's a shame you can't see this.", "The whole lot to unpack here. First, you sound a but dysfunctional. Your son is ONLY a chef?? Instead of a lawyer?? I would rather my son be a chef than a lawyer any day. If that is what made him happy, if that's what he wanted.  You need to stop with the snobbery. Stop being so classiest. Just meet your son for the human being he is. Drop your expectations of what he should be, and meet him for the man he is. I am also willing to bet your granddaughter isn't nearly as horrible as you make her seem. \n\nYTA", "YTA - your son, who fathered a child at the tender age of 18 stepped up to be a responsible parent to his child, and you cut him off because you disagreed with his choice. Because the rest of your kids got jobs to buy gifts for their niece, you threw a hissy fit and threw them out?  OP, I hope you realize that you are going to be a bitter and lonely old woman soon, because ALL of your kids are going to leave you alone.\n\nBTW - your son has become a **chef**.  Do you realize how HARD that is?  And you're disappointed because he didn't become a lawyer?  \n\nOP you should be ashamed of yourself. SO much assholery in your statements and attitudes.", "Hooo boy.  Where to start?\n\n>my son was nc with me\n\nEither your son is very stubborn, or this was just the straw that broke the camels back, and I am heavily leaning on the latter.\n\n>a lawyer, but now he is just a chef \n\nHe has a job, and he can support his family (according to you). The chef is a fairly prestigious positi9n depending on where you work, so I'm getting a lot of classist vibes from this.\n\n>I didn't approve of his parenting, which resulted in him going NC again\n\nAgain, this feels like you're only giving a part of the story.  If your son was willing to get back in touch with you, why were you so eager to just push him away again?  This seems very controlling considering the following:\n\n>turns out I have been supporting him al along. \n\n>they have been giving most of their money to my oldest.\n\nNo, your children have been supporting their brother, who was cut off from your family, likely at your request.  I keep getting super controlling and emotionally distant vibes here.\n\n>my younger kids have been spoiling her by giving her unnecessary things like new phones or helping him put her in a better school. \n\nHow is any of this spoiling her?  Getting into a good school is helping ensure she has a better life.  One that you have denied them by refusing to support you oldest the same way you've supported the others.  Also, it's their money, how do you think you have a say in how they spend it?\n\n>When I found out I was fuming and told them I'm done supporting them.\n\nSo because they spent their own money on helping their brother and niece, you decided to throw them out?\n\n>This resulted in a fight and my 22 and 18 yo moved in with my oldest. \n\nAnd then you add this as if it's shocking to you that they wouldn't want to stay with you after all this?\n\nYea, you sound like a controlling bitch.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Who raised him? Who taught him his values? also, you clearly don\u2019t support his choices, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not doing it for your approval.

It also sounds like you need to control your children's lives and are more invested in them becoming the person you think they should be than you supporting the person they are.  \n\n\nYou just sound miserable and bitter in general. Your son chose to raise his child, and has a good job. It's just not YOUR choice for him and you can't accept that he's an adult who ISN'T YOU. If you wanted him to be a lawyer you could have helped him through college, but even when she was a baby you clearly hated your grandchild and chose not to (which is fine)... so he made other plans and was successful in them without your help.

He was a very smart boy who was going to become a lawyer but now he is just a chef because he couldn't go to college. \n\nWe tried to fix our relationship a few months ago I met the kid for the first time and she was extremely rude and spoiled, I didn't approve of his parenting which resulted in him going NC again however it turns out I have been supporting him al along. \n\nYou see my youngest kids still lived at home and I financially supported them so they could focus on their studies but for some unknown reason they insisted on having part time jobs. \n\nNow I know why, they have been giving most of their money to my oldest. \n\nMy oldest has a job and can take care of himself and his daughter but my younger kids have been spoiling her by giving her unnecessary things like new phones or helping him put her in a better school. \n\nWhen I found out I was fuming and told them I'm done supporting them. They went behind my back and used me for my money. This resulted in a fight and my 22 and 18 yo moved in with my oldest. \n\nAm I wrong for not wanting to keep supporting them when they used me like that?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She could be charging them rent and they could be deciding to pay that but it's not up to her to decide where their money goes.", "Unless it is in a reply I missed I don\u2019t see op fuming 2 moved out. They will be back anyway they have gone to brothers who obviously can\u2019t support them as they are giving him money so his kid can go to a better school. Won\u2019t be long till he wants more money and they realise it is stay at brothers or go back home and still be able to attend college.", "a fleabag Medicaid bed", "Must depend on where you're located. The chefs at my work make very good money. But I guess you know everything.", "Overall their working a job and asking for support which shouldn\u2019t happen you\u2019re very naive to think they\u2019re using the job money on the kid and the borrowed money on themselves it\u2019s more likely they\u2019re using both money on both things when they spent to much on the ten year old they ask mommy for a handout which in turn is still spending her money on the kid cause they wouldn\u2019t need to borrow money if multiple people didn\u2019t spoil a kid beyond belief. My aunt has a daughter that all she has done is spoil she 14 now and gets into fights all the time cause her mouth which she got from being spoiled, she walks all over he parents she\u2019s 14 and has more valuables then most adults do. Meanwhile she\u2019s not a great student she doesn\u2019t work hard and she has a horrible attitude. These are all the things that is waiting for that 10 year old she\u2019s already out of pocket by the way she acts and more.", "No she legit said \u201cI financially supported them\u201d while they lived at home reading comprehension is important.", "You have a very\u2026.skewed view of how this played out. Her kids didn\u2019t lie to her or take advantage of her. They got jobs of their own and used that money to support their niece. It\u2019s not her right to police how they choose to use their money.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have to force a positive relationship with her oldest, even if her reasons for cutting him out are frankly ridiculous and elitist. But she also has no right to *demand* that her other children similarly cut out their older brother and niece.", "So how would OP's son have gone to college AND care for his daughter full time at 18?", "I recently became a grandmother.  I can't imagine treating my children or grandchild as horribly as OP did.", "Thank you! I wish this was higher so more people would see it.\n\nGrandma deserved everything she got here.", "You don't know that. My ex-MIL also told me not to have my child because I was young, and I never told my daughter that, but that's because I bit my tongue. Your son could've told her. Especially if you were NC for ten years.", "Why does she think she didn't meet you until recently?", "Well if she didn't know it before, she's going to find out soon that grandma wished she didn't exist, especially now that two of her dad's siblings decided to abruptly move in.", "She knows that you aren\u2019t in her life, and she may hear the sorrow in her dad\u2019s voice when you are mentioned.", "Kids aren't stupid and oblivious.  \n\nShe knows grandma exists and that she never sees her- she can put two and two together and guess you don't like her.", "But the kids are earning the money they use to buy gifts for their niece.", "You are right she supports them so they can concentrate on their studies but they got jobs to give to their niece sounds like big brother maybe put a guilt trip on them. If they want to work and study sounds like they don\u2019t need op\u2019s support to me. Yes you are right they can spend their money how they chose guess what so can op.", "Actually, it does.  If you're supporting your children because they're saying they need support, then you do indeed get to have an opinion on how they spend their money!  \n\nIt sounds like the OP has worked hard to support the kids and has probably made sacrifices.  So no, they don't get to decide how she spends her money.  I wouldn't have made the same decision as she did about her son, but she has the right to spend her money how she likes.", "So first son made the decision to not abandon his child, so OP cuts him off completely. Then she fibds out her other children are in contact and gofting their niece some nice things. Now OP wants to cut them off as well, because they are solely not obedient enough and dared to go against her will to ostrazice someone who did nothing wrong. Why are you so defensive for OP?", "I doubt their relationship will ever be good. Even if they go back, they will never forget this and go No contact with her ASAP. \n\nBut at least they won\u2019t be spending her money when she no longer has a relationship with them. \n\nYTA - I feel sorry for your children.", "Define very good money? At least not without a shitload of overtime. I've worked in 7 states, at very reputable and renown restaurants, and the pay is definitely not good. Of the 7 states, 3 of them were destination 'food' cities. Charleston, Chicago, Asheville, etc.", ">working a job and asking for support which shouldn\u2019t happen\n\nOne of these kids is only 17 years old. It's literally OPs duty as a PARENT to SUPPORT their CHILDREN....", "That doesn\u2019t mean they stole her money and gave it away? It means she fed them and gave them a house, as most parents do.", "\u201cYou see my youngest kids stayed at home\u201d they lived with her \u201cwhere I financially supported them\u201d which means they lived wit her and asked for cash from her. It\u2019s not skewed I simply read the post correctly.", "Day care?? That's what I did.", "Also even if it's not been said explicitly, the kid isn't a baby, she's probably asked about her grandparents and if dad's told something even close to the truth it's not looking good for OP.", "At no point did I say OP could not.", "No you can withdraw your support if you wish but you don't get to dictate how other people spend their money. You actually made that point yourself in your reply", "Because they are not giving niece some nice things if they are paying towards her going to a better school they are supporting her and brother and if they are staying at home with op so they can do that then by definition op is supporting them. I also think it is fair for op to comment on a rude and spoiled child and ok it does sound like her and her eldest will never have a relationship. Her other kids are ah if they think mum should support them so they can support their brother and niece. If they want to support themselves and give brother financial support then good luck to them and I would support that 100%.", "If they wouldn\u2019t be blowing money on spoiling a child they wouldn\u2019t have to be supported by her either way it\u2019s still taking money from her when they could easily support theirselves instead of aiding in the downfall of a child by making her spoiled rotten I\u2019ve seen the affects of a spoiled child and it\u2019s disgusting.", "The youngest one is 17. She supported financially because he is underage, no?", "No you didn\u2019t. You saw a vague phrase and took it to mean something else. \u201cFinancially supported\u201d could just mean she pays rent and utilities and groceries so that they don\u2019t have to. It could mean she helps pay for their schooling. It could mean all manner of things.\n\nBut nowhere is there any proof or statement that they lied to her to get extra pocket money, and then used specifically that money to support their niece. It sounds more like they got optional part-time jobs that they didn\u2019t *have* to get but chose to do of their own free will and then they used the money from the part time jobs in order to support brother and niece. Whatever money that they earn from their own labor at their own jobs is not something OP has any right to control.", "Oh! How nice! Was it free? How did you pay for it if you were 18 and going to be a student?", "If you want to have such black and white thinking in your relationships, please go ahead. For OP I see a childless future ahead.", "How on earth would they support themselves on a part time job?", "The 18 year old and the oldest ones are the children being discussed here her post only mentioned the 17 year old out showing the ages of her children the main problem was between an 18 year old and 28 year old adults.", "Either way money is leaving her account when it doesn\u2019t have to her kids work jobs to literally spoil a child why not work jobs to move out get a car or something valuable spoiling a child will just lead to a loser adult that has no value for anything cause they had multiple adults working jobs to support their spoiled habit. Why should 3 adults and the mom support a 10 year olds habits of being spoiled the dad is almost 30 he should be man enough to handle it on his own not need 4 people to support her habits.", "Many colleges have programs specifically for single parents during college, coming from a kid who had a single parent that got her master's", "Yes. Daycare at many colleges is free to students.", "By saving and building their resume until they can get a better paying job the route their going they\u2019ll have no savings or anything by time they get to a better job. But they\u2019d rather aid in the downfall of their niece.", "This is such BS reasoning haha. Now you\u2019re just moving goalposts because you can\u2019t handle being wrong.\n\nShe is helping them pay for schooling. Like just about any good parent would. It\u2019s normal for parents to help their children through higher education, it\u2019s not like many 18 year olds are going to be able to afford college on their own. Unless you think it\u2019s better for parents to just kick their children to the curb at 18? Again, skewed, I\u2019m sorry your own mommy and daddy apparently didn\u2019t love you very much and treated you that way so now you think it\u2019s normal, I assure you it is not.\n\nRegardless if this situation was the exact same but they weren\u2019t supporting their brother then no one, including you, would bat an eye. Kids are getting help from their parent to get through college - as is normal - and decided to get a side job on their own initiative so they have some extra spending money. Past that point, what they choose to actually *do* with that spending money is no one else\u2019s business but their own.\n\nThe only reason OP would have any leg to stand on would be if her kids actually were straight up lying to her to get extra non-essential funding, and then using that extra non-essential funding on things she didn\u2019t know about and didn\u2019t approve of, but that is not what is happening here. The financial support OP has provided for schooling has gone exactly where it was intended, how can she be upset if they decide to make some extra cash on the side for their own use?", "\"many\"\n\nInteresting. I didn't know that. I Googled the stats and what I found was \"less than half\", \"some\"and \"a handful\".\n\nBut you're ready to declare that this kid's college would do it and that OP is an AH for assuming (or knowing) they wouldn't?\n\n[https://www.accreditedschoolsonline.org/resources/most-parenting-friendly-colleges-by-state/](https://www.accreditedschoolsonline.org/resources/most-parenting-friendly-colleges-by-state/)\n\n[https://abound.college/finishcollege/advice/child-care-resources/](https://abound.college/finishcollege/advice/child-care-resources/)\n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/2018-05-16/what-to-know-about-child-care-access-in-college"]}
