I knew immediately what teacher he was talking about,  she was currently in the middle of a bitter divorce although I have no idea how the students knew about it.\n\nI told him that asking her that was needlessly cruel and that yes that does count as trying to provoke his teacher. He pulled a face, the two teachers with him thanked him and told him to come with them to the office, I headed to my lesson and didn\u2019t think about it for the rest of the day.\n\nGot home and maybe 20 minutes later Ru is at my door shouting about how I caused her son to be suspended because I wouldn\u2019t help him out and explain to the teachers that he didn\u2019t mean what he said as hurtful and now he\u2019s going to be a week behind at school because of me.\n\nI\u2019ve got relatives now going off on me about \u2018family loyalty\u2019 and \u2018being there for each other\u2019, I didn\u2019t think I did the wrong thing but the constant badgering from them is starting to get to me.", "created_utc": 1704545287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zzarb/aita_for_not_defending_my_cousins_child_at_school/", "score": 402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I told, my dad would go to the school and threaten lawsuits if the kid who had knocked my tooth out or whatever was disciplined, and the kid would be suspended for a week. \n\nThree of the 7 or so kids I got suspended ove that 2 year period came back to school with obvious signs that they had been smacked around recently by a parent who suddenly had to figure out what to do with their idiot kid who got himself suspended.  \n\nSo it appears that across international borders, early teenage little twats like this frequently have parents who react poorly to having to spend time with their shitty little kids.  I wonder why?", "NTA - being there for him means holding him accountable for what he's doing. Not leaving him on a self destructive path where he's 25 and doesn't understand why he's pushed his girlfriend away, got fired from his job, and got kicked out of a uni lecture for \"not meaning what he said as hurtful\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>now he\u2019s going to be a week behind at school because of me\n\n\\- this here shows that they don't get it.", "NTA. You helped your cousin's son learn an important lesson: actions have consequences. Everything that you did was right. J asked you to get involved, as did the teachers, and your response was correct when he told you what he said to the teacher. He was being a bully and admitted it to the teachers.   \n\n\nYour family are idiots. This was not about family loyalty, you did nothing but listen to J incriminate himself. Just tell anyone who asks is that you are a teaching assistant, not a teacher, nor do you have any authority to change his punishment. Let them know that you appreciate their feeling that you have such responsibilities, but that you're happy that they care about J doing better in school and are glad that they'll be helping J to correct his attitude at school.", "NTA nepotism isn\u2019t just for celebrities", "NTA---your actions have consequences and he did try to provoke a teacher. idk what's going on in your family's head, but they were probably told a whole other story by Ru or Jay if they're defending Jay's actions. either that or your family just didn't have empathy for the other teacher.", "Definitely nta.  People whether it\u2019s family or not need to be held accountable for their actions and it\u2019s clear he was being rude. Maybe your cousin should\u2019ve taught her kid to have better manners and be nicer and more compassionate and to have some empathy.", "NTA.  Ask the relatives how much family loyalty they would show to a member who confessed to throwing paint on pedestrians in a drive-by incident because they thought they were above the rules.\n\nAnd remember to cover your backside at work - kid's gonna be aiming for you.", "Your cousin is the A.  \n\nIf she knew how to raise a son than you wouldn\u2019t have had to do that.", "nta , you have a job, you just did what is fair. You need to leave personal relations outside of the workplace and you did exactly that. You wouldnt have defended a random student like that, so why would you defend HIM.", "Agree. If, and this is a big \"if\", this was the first time Jay had done something wrong or said something inappropriate I might cut him some slack. But considering he's been skipping school and not doing assignments, this totally hurtful comment is definitely something he should get into trouble for."]}
