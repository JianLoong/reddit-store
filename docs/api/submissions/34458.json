I knew immediately what teacher he was talking about,  she was currently in the middle of a bitter divorce although I have no idea how the students knew about it.\n\nI told him that asking her that was needlessly cruel and that yes that does count as trying to provoke his teacher. He pulled a face, the two teachers with him thanked him and told him to come with them to the office, I headed to my lesson and didn\u2019t think about it for the rest of the day.\n\nGot home and maybe 20 minutes later Ru is at my door shouting about how I caused her son to be suspended because I wouldn\u2019t help him out and explain to the teachers that he didn\u2019t mean what he said as hurtful and now he\u2019s going to be a week behind at school because of me.\n\nI\u2019ve got relatives now going off on me about \u2018family loyalty\u2019 and \u2018being there for each other\u2019, I didn\u2019t think I did the wrong thing but the constant badgering from them is starting to get to me.", "created_utc": 1704545287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18zzarb/aita_for_not_defending_my_cousins_child_at_school/", "score": 184, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's \"utterly inappropriate.\"  I'd probably follow up with: \"I think you know that.  And, if you don't know that, we'll have to put you in a special ed class, because if you don't know, then we'll probably need to hold you back.\"\n\nSecondly, it's not that it \"counts as\" anything.  That's \"You kids have a saying for it: FAFO.  In my time, we call that 'reaping what you sow'.  You decided to mess with a teacher, you thought I'd protect you because you're family, and you grossly misjudged that situation.  You think you can get away with this disrespectful behavior, and you were wrong.  And, I'm going to suggest the harshest possible punishment, because it seemed clear you were trying to antagonize someone while wrongly believing I'd protect you out of nepotism.

GHOST and move on.  They're going to be trailer trash their whole lives.  Double-down on it.  Keep an eye on him, and bust his ass every chance you get until he's suspended so much he'd held back, and then don't bat an eye if he's expelled.  And if they have to move b/c he's such a dumpster fire, don't blink.  No one needs kids that like in class.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You acted professionally and it\u2019s not your job to teach this brat manners and prepare him for a life out of trouble.

First of all, J needs to learn that his actions have consequences, and so-called \u201cfamily loyalty\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that kids shouldn\u2019t experience discipline.

Family loyalty doesn't mean you have to lie. Your cousin's remark was clearly intended to be hurtful and you called him out on it. That's integrity.

Because there's no logical defense that could be made and so you weren't going to convince anybody. The only thing you could apply would be authority you didn't have. If you'd been the principal, yeah you could've done it, at the cost of the teachers' trust in your fairness of course.\n\nYour relatives are really stupid.

So NTA and your cousin is just looking for someone else to blame for her son\u2019s poor behaviour, which I\u2019m sure is a constant theme.", "NTA She failed in her job to raise a son who wouldn\u2019t do stuff like that. So he had to learn that lesson at school. Now she has to deal with the consequences of not raising her son better. She should be concerned about his behavior and trying to get to the bottom of his attention seeking behavior instead of blaming you.", "Nah, if this is how the family is reacting, he won't take 2 minutes to reflect on his behaviour.
