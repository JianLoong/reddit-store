{"id": 29586, "submission_id": "17flymi", "title": "AITA for leaving a bday party because of a racist translation request?", "selftext": "Going to try to keep this short and sweet. I'm still getting text messages and it's making me more upset to read them.\n\nI went to a birthday party for Annie, my sister (F34). I (M36) and my wife (F36) went as we were able to get the her parents to watch the boy (our 16 MO son). It was a normal adult birthday party as she has no kids. She had some of her friends over and our parents. I'm white and all of my family are all white (important for the story).\n\nMy wife is Chinese, was born in China, and became a citizen when her and her family moved to the US when she was 16. She's 100% a US citizen, no green card, and she and all of her family speak Mandarin. My wife can speak English very well but her family, mostly elders, don't speak a lick of it. I've been learning Mandarin as it's my wives cultural language, it's cool AF, and I want the boy (and future children) to be able to speak both of our languages. It's been about 2 and a half years and I'm not very conversational yet, but I pick up on a lot of things, can understand the basic gist of most conversations, and I can speak basic sentences like, \"Is the food hot?\" or \"The boy's diaper has been changed?\", etc.\n\nI've also learning how to read and write Mandarin. Mostly reading right now as I find it helps me learn better, and I sometimes drop cool sentences into the Family Chat on Facebook. Annie doesn't speak very much in it but will post Fox articles, usually articles about China that are very critical of the government. I'm not sure if she's racist against Chinese people. She's never said anything negative to my wife in any way.\n\nSo last night, we're at the dinner table when Annie hands me a slip of paper. I ask what this is as I unwrap it. It says, \"Tiananmen Square 1989\", and I look up at her and she has this dumb grin on her face. I ask her what this is and she goes, \"can you translate that into Mandarin?\".\n\nThis is where people seem to think I'm the asshole: I got really freakin' mad. I immediately started yelling, called her a racist, and said we were leaving. My Mom and Dad got mad, Annie said I was being dramatic, and her friends (all of whom are also white) didn't see what the big deal was. I basically told everybody off using very big adult words before leaving. My phone started blowing up with text messages saying, \"you're not even Chinese what the hell\" and \"you ruined her birthday party\".\n\nI briefly spoke to my Mom this morning where I tried to explain why what she did was racist, targeted towards me and my family, and is unacceptable behavior. I told my Mom that I won't be going to the house anymore if she's there and that she needs help. My Mom softly echoed what my sister said.With all these text messages, I'm not sure anymore if I overreacted. My wife was unaffected by the whole thing but understands why I'd be upset.\n\nI don't know...am I the asshole for reacting this way?", "created_utc": 1698177993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17flymi/aita_for_leaving_a_bday_party_because_of_a_racist/", "score": 1252, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not that it's racist to discuss Tiananmen Square. It was her writing just that on a piece of paper, and asking you to translate it with a grin on her face.\n\nShe was stirring shit. She was being obnoxious and targeting either your wife, or you for your Chinese wife.  Or both.\n\nNTA. Assholery doesn't get a birthday pass.", "NTA\n\nWhat the fuck was even her point in giving you that paper and asking you to speak it out loud?\n\nDid she think your wife, whose family had a reason to leave their country and come to the USA, would be slighted by it? \n\nThis isn't even a microagression, this is a macroagression, and I applaud you for standing by your wife and future children (they will have to face this same ignorance from your family when they get older).", "I don't understand why people can't see that his sister is picking on his wife in a way that is racist.  \n\nNTA your sister is.", "NTA and you did not overreact. Annie is playing racist games, and doing it with the shit-eating \"who me?\" grin of so many racist dipshits. Unless your wife is secretly a member of the Chinese government, it is absurd to think that writing that down and giving it to you for translation into Mandarin is anything other than a provocation. Good for you for telling her off, you set an acceptable boundary and she will at least think twice about subversively insulting your wife and family.", "You may not be Chinese but your child is. You need to protect your child from the blatant racism of your family. NTA.", "Hard NTA. Your sister is very clearly upset that you married someone of Chinese descent. Posting Fox \"news\" articles about China is not a normal thing to do in a family chat.\nI wouldn't back down on this at all.", "I'm going with NTA. It absolutely was a racist gesture and racists should be called out when they do racist things, but she did it in such a way to make you look like the hole here even though you're not. That's what a lot of racists do - they bait people into their bullshit. Next time avoid the bait, get up and simply say \"i'm not putting up with your racist bullshit Annie\" and just leave.", "Info: your wife speaks English. What excuse did you sister offer for you needing to translate at all?", "NTA\n\n> My wife was unaffected by the whole thing but understands why I'd be upset.\n\nSounds like she's used to it and knew it wasn't a winning battle. But it's good that you were willing to stand up for her.\n\nYou sister is an insidious snake. She's being racist in a very subtle way that she can pass off as innocence. It's horrible because if you try to call her out, like you did at her birthday, people will do exactly as they have done: accuse you of overreacting. But I personally think this kind of subtle bullying is worse than if the person were straight up saying obviously bigoted things to a person's face, because this kind of shit is so much harder to fight against, and as you've seen, will result in more people defending the bully rather than their victim. \n\nBut it's the constant harassment, along with the fact that it's obviously being done with ill intent, that wears a person down. It's like being stalked by someone who does nothing more than follow you. They aren't doing anything egregious, but the constant presence and uncertainty of what that person might actually be capable of is exhausting. \n\nWhat she did is the equivalent of an Arab family asking a member of their family to translate \"World Trade Center 2001\" to their English-speaking American in-law. Her constant texts of articles criticizing China? Because she's the minority in your family (literally), if you were to say anything, \"oh, you're being too sensitive!\" How would your family feel if your wife were texting them articles criticizing the USA? \"How dare you criticize this great country, immigrants like you are ruining this country!\"\n\nETA: someone else mentioned your child. That's a very good point. These kind of poisonous micro-aggressions will have an even worse effect on your child when he's old enough to start understanding that Aunty has a problem with him and his mother, but he can't quite figure out what it is. I think it's in the interests of your wife and son to go low/no contact with your sister.", "I had to look up the Tiananman Square 1989 as that is something I didn't learn about, and I am absolutely disgusted by your sister. She is blatantly and passive aggressively be racist and the fact that she would ask you to basically translate about a massacre, what is with her. Her friends siding with her isn't a shocker, they probably are racist too. Your parents on the other hand by taking her side agree that her behavior is acceptable. I would honestly distance myself from all of them. Imagine them saying racist or prejudice things to or around your child. Smh  NTA op.", "NTA. Are you sure Annie is in her 30s? What a childish dig to try to make to insult your choice to learn Mandarin and your wife's heritage.", "NTA - who in their right mind brings something like this/does something like this at any birthday party, let alone their own? Your sister knew what she was doing, using her own party as an excuse to ramp up behavior that she absolutely knows is inappropriate, and now gets to play the victim because she was just asking innocent questions.", "NTA \n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even Chinese\u2026\u201d\n\nFun fact, decent people are disgusted with bigotry regardless of whether they belong to the group being discriminated against.", "You, my friend, are a human. You are rightly upset at this insult to not just your wife and her culture but to your own choice and judgement. Say to all the naysayers, \"If it's not a big deal, why didn't she ask my wife to translate the note? Who was she going to 'quote' this tragic date and locate to?\" Just do yourself a favor and go low contact. NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nRacial profiling someone with an insult? That is low.  \n\n\nI have crossed paths with several new Canadians recently. Notably from Afghanistan, Ukraine, Israel. The cab driver, on Saturday, was a young Arab-Israeli fellow, fresh to Canada. When he told me this I was dumfounded. What kind of things has he seen and put up with?   \n\n\nI would never make smirky jokes about what these people had to endure.", "NTA, your sister is racist. Maybe hand her something that references America's past sins like the eugenics movement of the 1900s, the origin of the word moron, or even the fact that the entire country is full of the descendants of invaders.", "NTA\n\nI didn't understand this thread at first, because Annie's behavior seems so bizarre and pointless.  That's what racism is, though, *stupid and pointless*, and let's throw in *evil* for good measure, too.\n\nI agree that handing the paper to her brother with a smirk and a grin was done to aggravate him.  \n\nIt's really creepy that she is apparently dwelling on this topic. It seems like she may be entertaining hateful thoughts in her head much of the time.  It's especially unnerving to think about her brooding and planning such meanness.\n\nYour sister may very well have some sort of mental health issues, OP.  People like her often get worse with time, too.  I agree with you to stay far, far away from her.  You need to protect your nuclear family.", "NTA\n\nGood on you for defending your wife. Standing up to family isn't always easy.\n\nYour sister sounds like a dick.", "NTA I think your sister was testing the waters and her attacks would get more and more blatant and aggressive. It was good that you caught it and cut if off immediately.", "So your sister thinks your wife was a tank driver for the peoples army?\n\nNTA  Imagine the response if your wife had made jokes in front of your family about high-school shootings in the USA.\n\nYour sister is broken and you need to keep her away from your wife and kids for the sake of your marriage. Mom should concentrate on trying to repair her parenting failure rather than victim blaming you and yours", "NTA. Nobody should be compelled to belittle or outright attack another person or group.", "Yes because let\u2019s fucking joke about an absolute massacre on a group of people.

Maybe and it seems like even you know you could have had a more measured approach. However, the callout was 100% warranted. It honestly sounds like this was building over time and you reached your limit. It was completely out of line for her to randomly pull a piece of paper with a very politically charged event on it and ask you to translate it. She was full well doing it for a reaction and that\u2019s exactly what she got.", "NTA definitely not the A-hole\nAs a mix couple white-asian, we got quite alot of microagressions from our family -both sides- but this one you had, this is macro.\n\nAnd yes both of us already exploded to our family and it sets boundaries, they are now more careful before opening their mouth. So I don\u2019t think that you overreacted, It is necessary to strongly stand your ground and avoid future agressions.", "NTA. Hard NTA. In fact, good job for standing up for your wife and family like that.\n\nAs an ABC, gotta say that white people trying to say \"Tianmen Square\" as a stupid \"gotcha\" is soooooooo annoying and blatantly racist.\n\nWtf does her being Chinese have to do with Tianmen Square, aside from the fact that she is Chinese? Does your racist sister thinks she's responsible for it? Does she think her family worship the government and are brainwashed, so she needs to rub her \"American Freedom Number One\" ego over them by this display of dominance? There was no reason for her to pick such a politically charged event aside from stroking her own ego or humiliating somebody else's. \n\n\nShes a sad little woman who loves to live in her ignorant bubble, eating up Fox News because she's too afraid to venture outside a neighborhood that isnt mayonnaise colored.", "NTA. I'd probably have advised cold dignity over yelling, just so that you can't be faulted on the form.\n\nNow, the deathly events at Tiananmen Square in 1989 were a terrible human rights violation and a tragedy. But using them to bully your wife at what was supposed to be a family celebration is no less reprehensible (and a lot more racist) than when, for example, someone handed me (German by birth) a little note about kristallnacht or the \"final solution\" of the Jewish question with a request to write it in German.", "I am going to give you the benefit of the doubt and say NTA.\n\nMy assumption is that you know her well enough to know what her intent was and that you felt it was an attack on your family.  If your wife was Israeli and your sister asked you to translate \"Holocaust 1939\" into Hebrew would that make a difference?\n\nWhile your reaction was severe, you and your sister are the only one in a position to know if it was proportionate.  Maybe next time ask them how to translate \"Golgotha 30\".\n\nTo others saying his wife is embarrassed and did not care: that is not the point as I see it.  OP felt attacked and responded in kind, his wife was not involved.", "You reacted it the right manner NTA and remind them they are racist every time you talk to them that's unacceptable behavior like middle schoolers making Holocaust jokes it's never been funny", "You stood up to a racist.

That's her own fault.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFocus on your mom: SHE is her aenabler, and she does not find anything wrong with your sister's behavior.

My parents are obsessed with the Epoch Times, which is run by the Falun Gong. So now everything is \"China bad and scary\". I actually lived in China, and my husband spends a LOT of time there, but our opinions are worthless because of some right wing bs. I can't even imagine being actually Chinese and dealing with this.

If you tried to type it in the chat, once you pressed enter it wouldn\u2019t even appear because it was so heavily sensored. \n\nAll that said, when I read your post and read what was written on the paper, I audibly gasped. I don\u2019t think anyone would understand if you don\u2019t have any ties to the Chinese culture, which would explain your family and friend\u2019s nonchalant reactions. Annie knew what she was doing but I don\u2019t think she understood the depth of it, which is no excuse. \n\nI personally don\u2019t understand the depth of it. I\u2019ve done some internet research to understand what happened but the cultural significance of how it was handled/is still being handled and dealt with by the Chinese gov. is something that might be difficult for someone raised outside of that culture to truly grasp and understand the emotional turmoil that surrounds it. Even hearing the name of that event makes me clam up because I\u2019ve been programmed to associate it as \u201cyou even mutter the name of this event and you lose your job.\u201d \n\nYou got emotional and maybe got too upset for the birthday party, but what was Annie expecting? She was trying to get a rise out of people by her stunt, right? She was trying to poke the bear and she met the bear.

I guess it\u2019s kind of smart because it\u2019s easy for people around her to write it off as a misunderstanding between the two of you but like I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just weird to me. Which maybe it just feels weird because it isn\u2019t the racism towards Chinese people I\u2019m used to hearing where it\u2019s very direct. Like one of best friends, her family ran the Chinese restaurant in our very white small town and a lot of people made jokes about them feeding people cats and dogs. \n\nAlso I guess I\u2019d call her more xenophobic than racist. I know they\u2019re more or less the same thing, but it feels to me like your sister dislikes and wishes to taunt your wife because she lived in and is from China and not just because she\u2019s Chinese. Like the government distrust angle she\u2019s playing just feels like it wouldn\u2019t apply to someone who\u2019s like second generation born in America. \n\nI\u2019m far from an authority on racism and have zero experience other than witnessing it growing up so these are just my thoughts. The semantics also don\u2019t matter anyway because clearly your sister is a bad human being to some degree. She also must have wanted to provoke you into leaving or something at the very least. She\u2019s trying to push you (probably mostly your wife) out of family gatherings and be the victim all at the same time.", "\nI can't understand why anyone would emigrate to the USA.

I'm still getting text messages and it's making me more upset to read them.  \nI went to a birthday party for Annie (F34). I (M36) and my wife (F36) went as we were able to get the her parents to watch the boy (our 16 MO son). It was a normal adult birthday party as she has no kids. She had some of her friends over and our parents. I'm white and all of my family are all white (important for the story).  \nMy wife is Chinese, was born in China, and became a citizen when her and her family moved to the US when she was 16. She's 100% a US citizen, no green card, and she and all of her family speak Mandarin. My wife can speak English very well but her family, mostly elders, don't speak a lick of it. I've been learning Mandarin as it's my wives cultural language, it's cool AF, and I want the boy (and future children) to be able to speak both of our languages. It's been about 2 and a half years and I'm not very conversational yet, but I pick up on a lot of things, can understand the basic gist of most conversations, and I can speak basic sentences like, \"Is the food hot?\" or \"The boy's diaper has been changed?\", etc.   \nI've also learning how to read and write Mandarin. Mostly reading right now as I find it helps me learn better, and I sometimes drop cool sentences into the Family Chat on Facebook. Annie doesn't speak very much in it but will post Fox articles, usually articles about China that are very critical of the government. I'm not sure if she's racist against Chinese people. She's never said anything negative to my wife in any way.  \nSo last night, we're at the dinner table when Annie hands me a slip of paper. I ask what this is as I unwrap it. It says, \"Tiananmen Square 1989\", and I look up at her and she has this dumb grin on her face. I ask her what this is and she goes, \"can you translate that into Mandarin?\".  \nThis is where people seem to think I'm the asshole: I got really freakin' mad. I immediately started yelling, called her a racist, and said we were leaving. My Mom and Dad got mad, Annie said I was being dramatic, and her friends (all of whom are also white) didn't see what the big deal was. I basically told everybody off using very big adult words before leaving. My phone started blowing up with text messages saying, \"you're not even Chinese what the hell\" and \"you ruined her birthday party\".  \nI briefly spoke to my Mom this morning where I tried to explain why what she did was racist, targeted towards me and my family, and is unacceptable behavior. I told my Mom that I won't be going to the house anymore if she's there and that she needs help. My Mom softly echoed what my sister said.  \nWith all these text messages, I'm not sure anymore if I overreacted. My wife was unaffected by the whole thing but understands why I'd be upset. \n\nI don't know...am I the asshole for reacting this way?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
