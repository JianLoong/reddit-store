She normally gets very good grades and is continuing to in college. She is having a problem in one class though. She has called me and her mom to vent about the problem she is dealing with. Her mom has been rather dismissive, and is telling her and I that we are being racist. I am being racist because I\u2019m sympathizing with her issue. \n\nHere is her issue: she is struggling in a math class. She tells us that she is struggling because she has a hard time learning in lecture because her professor has a very thick Indian accent. She says that multiple classmates as well as herself are struggling in this class because they say they can\u2019t understand their teacher. I am sympathizing with her because I don\u2019t quite understand how they are expected to learn from someone who has trouble speaking clear English. I don\u2019t mean to be the \u201cthis is America\u201d guy but this is America and the teachers should have to be understood by their students. \n\nI told my daughter that I will write/ call in to the school to complain. I\u2019m paying for her college. I don\u2019t like that I\u2019m paying for her to receive ineffective instruction. I\u2019m not sure writing/calling will do anything but I\u2019d still do it for her and the rest of those kids having the same issue. \n\nMy wife is telling my daughter to suck it up, and saying we are being racist. I do think my wife is biased because she works with many Indian people and is used to understanding their accents. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist to want my daughter to understand her lessons.

The issue is not that he has an Indian accent but that he has a strong accent at all. \n\nI'm Indian-American and I remember visiting London with my parents. At some point we had to ask for help but none of us could understand the man at the information desk because of his strong cockney accent, even though we are all fluent in English (and I am native).\n\nIf *everyone* in the class is doing poorly then your *daughter* and her friends should talk to the head of the department. Not you. First, though, they need to ask themselves if this man really has a strong accent or if they're just unwilling to work with people of foreign backgrounds. It doesn't matter if this their first time encountering someone with an accent; part of going to a university is learning to work with people of different backgrounds. If other people in the class are doing well then maybe the issue is them and not the teacher.", "I'm not going to render judgement, but I will say this as a professor: your writing/calling to complain will do absolutely less than nothing, and no one at the university will be able to, much less willing to, give you information about her professors, her progress, or what goes on inside her classes.  It's literally against the law (look up FERPA) for them to communicate with you about her classroom activities.\n\nThat said, your daughter needs to get a tutor.", "Info: how many times has your daughter gone to office hours to get clarification on something one on one?", "Look, this is a great opportunity for your daughter, and you would be doing her a disservice if you got involved. To start, if she has a problem, she needs to address it with the professor herself. Full stop. This isn't a matter of harassment or anything that puts her at risk, and she needs to learn how to face extremely minor interpersonal conflict like this.\n\nSecondly, the fact of the matter is that she will likely find herself in many situations throughout the course of her life where there's a communication barrier due to an accent, unless she moves to an extremely homogenous area. I can understand it being frustrating in the context of academia, but she needs to find a way to cope.\n\nThis is also potentially a good lesson for you, not only in letting your daughter fight her own battles, but remembering you don't know everything going on. No matter how good of a person and student your daughter is, there could be so many other factors at play here. She might be accustomed to only half paying attention in class because everything normally comes naturally to her. She may be struggling with the material and looking for an excuse because she's worried what you'll think of her grades. She may be claiming other students have the same issue as an exaggeration. As the only one who actually knows what's going on, she needs to be the one to address it, if necessary.", ">I told my daughter that I will write/ call in to the school to complain. \n\nYTA.  She's in college, not Kindergarten.  That's what you should have told her.\n\nShe can deal with the problem herself, in whatever way she chooses (discussing it with the school, partnering with other students to learn the material, going online to Khan Academy, whatever).", "YTA \n\n[1] Daughter should address this head on and take accountability. Not daddy since daddy holds the wallet. \n\n[2] What the hell \u201cthis is America\u201d suppose to mean? Please enlightened me on what that means. Be specific. \n\n[3] If the problem is about the thick accent, why can\u2019t she and her fellow classmates ask questions? You know, to clarify. Why does it need to resort to you writing a letter? What do you want accomplished here?\n\n[4] Wife is right. Suck it up.\n\nPS\nI had a Russian professor for math in my freshman year. His writing was hard to read in addition to having a thick accent. Guess what? We asked questions. We asked him to repeat at times. This shouldn\u2019t be hard.", "Lmao YTA and this is entirely your daughter\u2019s fault. Here\u2019s why, the college your daughter goes to probably has MANY resources to help her learn the material, which I guarantee she isn\u2019t using. It\u2019s math, it is universal on all languages.\n\nIs she asking questions, attending office hours, reading the book, working through examples, using the math/tutor center, asking the TAs/student assistants? All of which the college probably has - my community college and university both offered theses services DAILY!\n\nShe isn\u2019t consulting outside resources either. Does she record her lectures? Resisten/rewatch them slowed down for review? \n\nIt is her responsibility to learn the material. The professor presents the topics, and answers questions. College isn\u2019t high-school where the teachers are there to make sure you learn. College is for adults who are capable of independent learning and take on the challenges of mastery seriously.\n\nRespectfully, your daughter is failing to do her due diligence as a student. Every hour she spends in class she should be devoting 3-4 hours outside to aid her learning.", "\u201cI don\u2019t mean to be the \u2018this is America\u2019 guy, but this is America.\u201d\n\nThis told me all I need to know about you. YTA", "YTA- I am somewhat sympathetic to your daughter (I had a similar issue in a an econ class years ago). But two things tip it to YTA. You do sound racist. And in general with college, that\u2019s an issue between the student/professor/department. Universities don\u2019t take kindly to parents pulling the \u201cI need to talk to your manager\u201d shit from parents", "YTA and doing daughter a disservice. Needs to suck it up and learn, the world is diverse. What would happen when she gets a job and has to work with people with accents? Are you going to call her boss and complain? Let the kids figure it out.", "NTA for taking your daughter's side, but your solution seems to miss the mark, in my opinion. Your daughter is an adult. She should be handling it on her own. If the teacher is difficult for her to understand, and others are also struggling for the same reason, she should discuss this with the professor.\n\nThere are many solutions to this problem, such as having the professor publish their lecture notes, getting the notes from a student that isn't struggling, etc.\n\nComplaining to the school is pretty far down that list. And your reaction to offer anything more than advice does cross the line into AH territory.\n\nFor those that believe it's racist because someone can't understand an accent, that is a rather broad use of the term that I think reduces the actual definition. There are many accents of your native language that I guarantee you cannot understand from people that have your same native tongue (and race). \n\nAccents can be tough. They can click for some and take longer for others. My advice for the daughter would be to talk to the professor and apologize that she hasn't encountered that accent before, but could they talk slower, etc. Another option for her: attend their office hours basically every session and go over the lectures together. \n\nUniversity is a chance to learn about society as much as the topics of your classes. She'll eventually learn the accent and understand when next she encounters it.\n\nSummary - as asked, I'd say, no NTA for taking her side. But you kinda suck for your solutions. But not for racism.", "YTA\n\nI *seriously* doubt that the entire class is actually failing because of a fucking accent. Your daughter is grown and needs to solve this herself. In the world we live in now where there is plenty of online assistance or on campus help and tutoring she should be able to pass", "NTA, but you need to handle this differently.  YOU calling/writing the university will achieve nothing, they will not even acknowledge you.  Your daughter needs to handle this, so teach her how.  Give your daughter advice on how to handle it herself.  She should start by reaching out to the other students in the class, see if they are struggling too, set up a study group to help each other.  Definitely go see her Academic advisor about it, ask for advice, see if she can switch to a different professor or drop the class and retake with a different professor next semester.  She can also make an appointment to get tutoring.  \n\nMy son went through this recently with a TA.  He\u2019s had many classes with professors of many nationalities, but this one (also a math class) neither he nor his classmates could understand and they struggled.  If the professor doesn\u2019t speak English well enough to clearly communicate the material, thats a problem the university needs to be aware of and mitigate.  But it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s responsibility to deal with her education, so teach her how.", "YTA.\n\n\"This is America\" - what does America have to do with the need to understand professors? Is the implication here that other countries don't have this need? The sub-text here says a lot about you. America is a cultural crock pot, it was always meant to be a cultural crock pot. This professor did nothing wrong simply by being born in another country, moving to America, and getting a job. It's like you're offended simply because this person exists. And instead of working with it, you're trying to work against it.\n\nY'all went about this in so many wrong ways. For one, she's in college now. If she wants to be treated like an adult, she has to act like one. Not run to mommy and daddy when she has a problem with a teacher. And you're enabling her dependence by participating.\n\nHow did you rationalize this was something to complain about instead of teaching your daughter to work *with* people, not against them? If this is a freshman course filled mostly with doe-eyed 17 and 18-year-olds fresh out of high school, then I'm betting a lot of them lack initiative. Did it even cross your mind to encourage your daughter to actually open up a dialogue with the professor? Actually say to their face with respect, \"I want to learn in your class, but I'm stuggling to overcome the language barrier. Can you slow down a little bit so I can learn all I can?\" Even native English-speaking professors are going to hear that from time to time. \"Language barrier\" isn't a curse word. How you attempt to overcome a language barrier says a lot about your character, though.\n\nWhy does this specific person not deserve the same respect and instead deserve to have some entitled dad write a strongly worded letter that will probably go straight into the trash because you're not the first jackass who tried this? You both proved your ignorance and your inability to see your daughter as an adult who needs to start handling their own shit.", "Yta. Your daughters grown and in college. If she has an issue she can talk to her professor herself and work out a solution instead of having daddy complain to the school about an accent. She called you to vent, she's a big girl and she can handle this herself. Getting someone in trouble, or trying to for having an accent is an ah move. \n\nShe and these other students struggling can all bring this up. Now if that happened and they were told to f off. Then yes, I could understand you perhaps involving yourself.", "This cracks me up: colleges laugh at parents who call or write to complain about this type of stuff. She can certainly vent to you and you can help her problem solve but know that your intervention at the college will be met with a polite, but firm, \"mind your business.\"\n\nLook, we've all had professors at the university level who had accents or other communication styles that we, as students, had to put extra time and energy into understanding. She's going to run into Ph.D's from all over the world if she's at a good college as the school is going to hire the most qualified scholar they can for each role. Qualified as in \"subject matter expert\", not \"speaks American English in an approved accent.\" She can consider it part of the education she's getting: she's learning how to understand language and communication styles from groups she hasn't encountered before. It's good to learn how to ask clarifying questions and listen deeply to move through the world as an adult. I'm an American, raised in a Western state, and have a harder time understanding a Tidewater Virginian's accent than I do an Indian accent in English myself. Learning how to decode English spoken in different accents as a kid really helped me learn foreign languages and fine tune my pronunciation in Spanish and German and gave me the skills to communicate when traveling when I didn't speak the language. This is a skill set. Consider it extra value for \"your\" money if that's really how you view your daughter's education.", "YTA\nWelcome to university where people from all over the world are hired due to there research fields. Is communication sometimes a struggle. Yup. \n\nHow long has this prof been teaching? If a first year it may be worth it for your DAUGHTER to approach the department. Minimally 2 things. This should be noted on the course feedback at the end of the semester and 2. She should get in the habit of evaluating which courses she\u2019s going to take based on the prof. Which prof is teaching is usually known when signing up for classes, she can check out \u2018rate my prof \u2018 and see what the individual reviews are. \n\nAs for now, she needs to learn how to learn. This is often a struggle first year especially for those who did well in highschool and are now thrown by having to do things differently. She has a text book? Practice exams, lean on friends (encourage her to make contact with people in other years\u2026 they can be helpful if they have already taken the course), office hours, etc\n\nAlso, if it is a course with multiple sections. Confirm if the exam is the same for all. Usual is. She can likely attend a different lecture slot\u2026 assuming it is like many first year courses which have multiple of the same,  and attendance isn\u2019t tracked. \n\nBut dad. Whatever you do, do NOT contact the university on her behalf. Nope nope nope.", "YTA. Hate to break it to you, but that's not likely to be the only professor she ever has with an accent. She will likely have many more. You both need to suck it up. Instead of complaining about the accent, she can seek a tutor. Many schools offer free tutoring. She can also attend office hours with the professor and ask for clarification on things she didn't understand.", "I went to an engineering school and had several classes where I couldn't understand the professor. So I went to the teaching assistants. \n\nI would have been mortified if my parents complained to the school.

You may be paying for her college but if you are expecting to be treated like a customer then you won\u2019t be getting a decent education.", "INFO: how long has she been attending the class?  People get used to new accents if they try.  Academia is full of foreigners from all over (who are usually the best person for the job) - this is not going to be the last time she has to cope with this.", "NTA. Wtf is with all the ridiculous takes. A pretty basic requirement of being a professor is being able to communicate in a comprehensible manner.", "Yta.  Mostly because your daughter is an adult and emailing the school to complain on her behalf is inappropriate. Furthermore there are resources available and she needs to seek them out.", "YTA There are SO MANY resources for people who want to learn math, that complaining about this as a reason why your grades in math are slipping sounds to me  like racism.", "YTA by trying to solve your daughter's problems for her. She's not in high school anymore, and she's gonna have to talk to the teacher and department heads directly to find a solution. You can't just swoop in and save the day whenever you want because she's going to think \"oh, dad will always be there for me no matter what.\" You can provide guidance and back her up if the college doesn't do anything after she's exhausted all efforts on her end first, but let her try to solve it on her own first.\n\nSadly, dad won't always be there for her. What are you going to do when she has problems in her early career? Call her management because she's your baby? If you continue this trend, you're going to set her up for failure in the real world. \n\nIf other people in her class have the same problem, they can all reach out to the mathematics department directly to take some action. In the meantime, she can get tutoring on campus or find a private tutor to help her catch up. Her professor isn't going to be the only foreigner she's going to encounter in higher education in her future career.", "YTA- a parent reaching contacting the school or professor is very improper and it\u2019s illegal for them to discuss with you anything involving your daughters academics. If she is struggling, SHE can be an adult and deal with it. Go to office hours, get a tutor, the university absolutely has resources she can utilize. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019ll encounter and have to work with someone who has an accent, she needs to get used to it and deal", "YTA. Your daughter is in college. She needs to be advocating for herself and solving her own problems. She can ask for tutoring, create study groups, or go visit the professor during office hours to help her understand the material. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re both in denial about this being a problem with the professor when \u201cshe\u2019s never had any problems before.\u201d I see this all the time. It\u2019s college. Not high school. The pace, the expectations, and personal responsibility are all increased. It is not unusual for students to go through an adjustment period in college. She may find that she needs to put in more work to understand the material and the classes are less tailored to the individuals experience, especially the larger 100 level courses. \n\nYou\u2019ll do more for your daughter by letting her learn to solve her own problems and acknowledge her responsibility to do so than by getting yourself involved.", "University is a different ball game than high school. Often high achievers in high school think university will be similarly easy but it isn't. Math especially gets really complicated and as someone with an engg degree who had to do a bunch of math courses i can attest to the univ math being really tough. So, I am not sure how the accent is really stopping your child from understanding math. It's most likely the math itself that's tough. \n\nYTA both you and your daughter for actually blaming the tools rather than doing some self-introspection.", "YTA. Your daughter needs to handle this and figure it out for herself. Running to you won\u2019t do anything but exacerbate the issue. I was never a straight A student and every single one of the math/Finance/OPM professors in college had thick accents. I actually did better in College than in HS because I took responsibility for my success and became my own advocate when I needed to figure stuff out.", "Yta what do you think is going to happen?

She needs to sign herself up for math tutoring instead of complaining and doing nothing.", "YTA for the this is America comment alone.", "YTA, especially for wanting to call the school yourself lol. Your daughter is an adult. \n\nBut to your question: are there any resources for deaf students at her school who wouldn't be able to hear the lectures anyway? There should be if the school is following ADA guidelines tbh. Those could help if she truly can't understand him when he talks.", "YTA, you daughter is not applying herself, there are so many resources available to her she can literally skip all the lectures if she wanted. This is Math not theoretical physics. The fact that you don't want her to do extra work because it's unfair is shows us this is not about her grades.", "YTA People have different accents welcome to reality. In the UK some accents are so strong non UK people struggle. Accents are very classist in the UK - there is no correct way to speak and has evolved over 1000s of years. Americans think we all sound like the queen. Listening to the pretty much always American international students complain they came to the UK and have to be taught by shock horror, UK accents was hilariously eye rolling. What do mean a Scottish man will teach me in Scotland?! \n\nShe\u2019s an adult - it\u2019s not going to stop with that one lecturer. If she goes into academia for instance she\u2019s going to work with internationals from all over the world with a range of accents.

I ask questions and get clarification. Not demand to only talk to another British born and bred because I shouldn\u2019t have to tolerate reality.\n\nAlso stop being embarrassing she\u2019s an adult - no one gives a crap if you message the uni.

Visiting professors at a college level is commonplace.\n\nSecond, with all the technological advances, your daughter can't find an app for her phone to record the lectures? We did it in the 90s. Mini cassette players were a godsend. Bought a week's worth of tapes, got the professor's blessing and away we went. Notes were transcribed at home and if I had a question concerning the content, I'd make an appointment. \n\nThird, nowadays a lot of teachers record their lectures and post them online.

The biggest difference between high school and university is that it's out of our parents' control and entirely on us to self regulate and solve our own problems and challenges and right now you are depriving her of that learning opportunity. \n\nOverall I'm giving a NAH as my judgement. She's new and encountering failure for the first time, you love your daughter, your wife's indifference is acceptable, and the prof obviously can't change their accent.

In the most important exam of my high school (and pretty much one of the most defining exams a person takes during their life) had a listening comprehension of a man with somewhat thick Indian accent.\n\nAccents are part of life, so to excell, at minimum you need to learn how to understand accents in your own language.", "Agreed!!

And when the class ends she can give the professor a bad review. If other kids are really struggling, then he will probably get other bad reviews and get reprimanded or replaced. But if you go complain now it's probably not going to help, and might even make the professor not like your daughter. It's better to tell her to suck it up until the class ends.

If so, then the requests are working the way they are intended. Students often interpret neutral responses as negative.

My response is always to ask what they have done to get better at learning in that situation. Often it has not even occurred to them that they have the power to make changes to their own approach or strategies. The assumption is that others should change for them.

This does happen, and it's not as rare as you might expect.\n\n>Second, college students are generally expected to study outside the classroom as well as attending lectures.\n\nYes, but that is studying in addition to the material being taught by the professor, it's not an either or situation.\n\nLectures have a time-frame, if the students need to ask the professor to repeat each sentence multiple times they will never cover the material. If the professor is that hard to understand for multiple students the school needs to put something in place to alleviate that situation, it's not on the students who are paying to be there to have to go to extraordinary lengths to learn material they are supposed to understand through lecture.", "Did I say they were speaking English in Spain? Not at all. The analogy was to express how a predominantly English speaking professor would not be suited to teach in a foreign country if they didn't have fluency in their language. Unlike this country, in that case, they wouldn't have a job.\n\nYes, college students are expected to study outside of class. But, the purpose of a teacher is to teach. If they're not adequately teaching, they're not doing their job.", "Teachers are supposed to teach.  If they aren't able to convey the subject matter effectively for whatever reason, how do you expect students to be able to study effectively if they don't have a basis of understanding?", "The answer to that question is clearly yes, based on his responses to this post.", "Good God, back in the 90s, we'd record our lectures on mini cassette tapes and transcribe the notes back at the dorm. I don't see why OP's daughter can't download an app to her phone or even pick up a digital recorder at the campus bookstore and go from there. \n\nI had a visiting professor from the USSR, very thick accent. More than once, I'd have to make an appointment to review a topic I was having difficulty with. The recordings and notes made it so much easier to clear up any misunderstanding when we met.", "that\u2019s college for you", "Your coworkers never teach you anything? I've learned a lot from coworkers and managers after finishing academia and it's been vital that I'm able to communicate with them as well as external stakeholders that my company has little to no control over.", "OP said multiple studients. Multiple can be a handful, it does not necessarily means most of them.", "Nowhere in the original post was it suggested that the professor isn\u2019t fluent in English. The entire complaint is about the professor\u2019s *accent*. And while equating a heavy accent with not being fluent in the language is racist, per se, it\u2019s certainly xenophobic. \n\nHave a nice day.", "That's the problem! We're told that we're supposed to struggle that much through college and that only serves to students to quietly accept incompetent professors. That's Stockholm Syndrome! We're perpetuating bad learning experience.\n\nEducation has evolved so much over history, why the hell we believe that modern education has nothing to improve?", "Of course they did (other languages mainly). \n\nBut you\u2019re purposely missing the point, they\u2019re not laying the foundation for what I will be doing for the rest of my life. They\u2019re not actively teaching me things that I will need to build upon later to actually GET into the work force. \n\nDealing with thick accents is different when you\u2019re working. You can ask them to email you, text you, speak slowly. But it is not her burden to accommodate the professor with the speech issue. It is on the faculty to make sure he is qualified and that includes his speech. \n\nIn my line of work, if an instructor has a thick accent then he is first sent into a speech class to work it out. I don\u2019t put the trainees through the hassle of having to mentally drain themselves trying to decipher their accents. \n\nMe as the manager, I can deal with him all day!", "chill the fuck out, she\u2019s struggling cause she wants to, there\u2019s resources she could utilized and chooses not to, the professor is clearly qualified, what do you expect the professor to do? he can\u2019t change the way he talks, he\u2019s doing his job"]}
