Is this guy trying to double dip on everyone?", "NTA - wedding gifts and you\u2019re not invited to the wedding or reception is a little weird. Long flight for a bachelor party when people need babysitters is not great. He wants to have the same things as everyone else in the friend group, but those expectations don\u2019t match the experience.", "NTA wedding gifts are given at a wedding! I can understand having the bachelor party afterwards if they eloped and myself I'd probably attend but you're under no obligation to do so. Asking for gifts afterwards is just grabby.", "NTA. This is a blatant gift grab. Had he made you aware before that would be one thing, but they basically got married without telling a number of people, then went on their honeymoon, now he's back and some time has passed he's planning a destination \"bachelor party\" and asking people for gifts.\n\nIf you declining causes issues then it's even more obvious it's all about the gifts.", "NTA.

It seems more an excuse to ask for money or gifts. He's free to do what he wants, but he is not entitled to ask for gifts, especially because he didnt brother to tell anyone about his marriage, even you that are his friend for 20 yrs....\nSo no, you are absolutely not the a-hole and are free to decline.", "NTA\n\n\nMy question: how is this your best friend for 20 years while you're being blind sided by his behavior?

I have given gifts to celebrate the marriage of someone who means something to me without attending the wedding.  One of my best friends eloped and another had a courthouse ceremony, they both got gifts from me. My cousin who lives on the other side of the country got married,  I sent a gift. \n\nI think you are butt hurt that you were not invited, but it does not appear they just excluded you, so you can run with that or decide the friendship is worth more than that and be happy for him and help to celebrate that happiness.

And every couples live together. I gave them all a gift when they moved in together. When 2 of them got married I gave a smaller gift than I would normally give if I hadn't given the first gift. As a wedding gift I usually pay for my meal and give some extra as present. I gave them the extra when they moved in together and the wedding gift was me paying for my meal.\n\nI don't need an invitation to gift my best friends when they get marry/decide to move in together. I do it because I love them.\n\nSo, yeah, you are resentful they didn't invite you. Well, they didn't invite anyone. It was their own thing. If you think they don't deserve a gift because of that then you're an AH.", "Best friend of 20 years eloped for whatever reasons are personal to him.

Just because he didn\u2019t do it the traditional way doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s some jerk that didn\u2019t invite you to his wedding. \n\nFor reasons I won\u2019t be sharing, I too had a court house wedding that involved just the two of our parents and siblings. We had dinner with just our parents and siblings. We have been married for two years and we still plan on having a big \u201creal\u201d wedding once we can afford it. When that moment comes I expect my friends and family to treat it like they would any other wedding. \n\nI got married during Covid pandemic. I got married before I could afford to do the things my wife and I wanted to do. If my best friend was like \u201cdamn, you didn\u2019t invite me to your courthouse wedding, fuck you\u201d Id be very disappointed in them. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go to Columbia either, though. I\u2019m frankly afraid to travel to South America due to my fear of being a cartel target (probably a stupid fear). But if he\u2019s celebrating with you in whatever country you are from, yeah you probably should get him a wedding gift.

It could be fun going with the fake bachelor esthetic, as long as it's friend having fun together.\n\nBUT, having the Bachelor party in another country is pretty excessive and your friend simply can't expect most people to join him and presumably pay for the trip.
