Is this guy trying to double dip on everyone?", "NTA - wedding gifts and you\u2019re not invited to the wedding or reception is a little weird. Long flight for a bachelor party when people need babysitters is not great.

It seems more an excuse to ask for money or gifts. He's free to do what he wants, but he is not entitled to ask for gifts, especially because he didnt brother to tell anyone about his marriage, even you that are his friend for 20 yrs....\nSo no, you are absolutely not the a-hole and are free to decline.", "NTA\n\n\nMy question: how is this your best friend for 20 years while you're being blind sided by his behavior?

One of my best friends eloped and another had a courthouse ceremony, they both got gifts from me. My cousin who lives on the other side of the country got married,  I sent a gift. \n\nI think you are butt hurt that you were not invited, but it does not appear they just excluded you, so you can run with that or decide the friendship is worth more than that and be happy for him and help to celebrate that happiness.

And every couples live together. I gave them all a gift when they moved in together. When 2 of them got married I gave a smaller gift than I would normally give if I hadn't given the first gift. As a wedding gift I usually pay for my meal and give some extra as present. I gave them the extra when they moved in together and the wedding gift was me paying for my meal.\n\nI don't need an invitation to gift my best friends when they get marry/decide to move in together. I do it because I love them.\n\nSo, yeah, you are resentful they didn't invite you. Well, they didn't invite anyone. It was their own thing.

Just because he didn\u2019t do it the traditional way doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s some jerk that didn\u2019t invite you to his wedding. \n\nFor reasons I won\u2019t be sharing, I too had a court house wedding that involved just the two of our parents and siblings. We had dinner with just our parents and siblings. We have been married for two years and we still plan on having a big \u201creal\u201d wedding once we can afford it. When that moment comes I expect my friends and family to treat it like they would any other wedding. \n\nI got married during Covid pandemic. I got married before I could afford to do the things my wife and I wanted to do. If my best friend was like \u201cdamn, you didn\u2019t invite me to your courthouse wedding, fuck you\u201d Id be very disappointed in them. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go to Columbia either, though. I\u2019m frankly afraid to travel to South America due to my fear of being a cartel target (probably a stupid fear). But if he\u2019s celebrating with you in whatever country you are from, yeah you probably should get him a wedding gift.

I didn\u2019t ask or expect anything but they took it upon themselves to give us gifts. His family however didn\u2019t even send a card. Guess it depends. I appreciated all the gifts. And I feel like I\u2019m the type of person that would do the same in a similar situation", "I'm confused as well. Does OP even like his best friend? If my friend got married, had a birthday, anything, and there was no party, I would still get them a gift.", "Yeah it seems strange OP is so offended. He wants to celebrate, and the family dinner, honeymoon, and girls\u2019/guys\u2019 trips are the more important bits to him than the big expensive wedding. I\u2019d personally love going to Colombia with a bunch of friends? No gift necessary imo but maybe something small, like what you\u2019d give as a bday gift.\n\nYTA", "Are you familiar with courthouse ceremonies? They're typically small by nature.

It\u2019s tacky and rude. \n\nGoing to the courthouse we rented out a guy as our witness, but there were also tons of other people gathered like they were ready for church and the whole 9 yards.

People can choose to still give gifts but it\u2019s completely up to them whether they do so. It\u2019s also weird to want a bachelor party post wedding. His married, he\u2019s not a bachelor anymore. If he wants to do a friends trip to spend time with everyone that\u2019s fine. But if he wants something where he gets celebrated and he gets gifts then he and his wife need to plan a party for friends the way he had the dinner with family. I understand eloping as an option to save money bc weddings can be really expensive. But that means your friend has to forgo some of the perks that come along with a wedding", "Tell him you\u2019ll give the gift to him in person at the wedding", "Exactly. Don\u2019t let him. What\u2019s done is done. He could have said, \u201cwe eloped. If y\u2019all would like to send us a gift, great. If not, it\u2019s understandable \u201c.  Just tell him he is not a bachelor anymore. He has to focus on his wife now.", "I don't understand why he never sent anything after they eloped! He literally kept waiting because he wanted to go to a party.....and than got offended when invited to a party.....\n\nI dunno.... It's clear he's upset from the way it's written...so I don't know how unbiased and clear explanation we are getting. He stresses the best friend thing....but why not have a conversation with him about it instead of asking strangers on the internet??", "[removed]", "[removed]", "NTA.

That is totally off the table, but how about these options. (then lay out what you and your friends are comfortable with).\n\nHe can take it or leave it.
