Is this guy trying to double dip on everyone?", "NTA - wedding gifts and you\u2019re not invited to the wedding or reception is a little weird. Long flight for a bachelor party when people need babysitters is not great.

It seems more an excuse to ask for money or gifts.

One of my best friends eloped and another had a courthouse ceremony, they both got gifts from me. My cousin who lives on the other side of the country got married,  I sent a gift. \n\nI think you are butt hurt that you were not invited, but it does not appear they just excluded you, so you can run with that or decide the friendship is worth more than that and be happy for him and help to celebrate that happiness.

And every couples live together. I gave them all a gift when they moved in together. When 2 of them got married I gave a smaller gift than I would normally give if I hadn't given the first gift. As a wedding gift I usually pay for my meal and give some extra as present. I gave them the extra when they moved in together and the wedding gift was me paying for my meal.\n\nI don't need an invitation to gift my best friends when they get marry/decide to move in together.

Just because he didn\u2019t do it the traditional way doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s some jerk that didn\u2019t invite you to his wedding. \n\nFor reasons I won\u2019t be sharing, I too had a court house wedding that involved just the two of our parents and siblings. We had dinner with just our parents and siblings. We have been married for two years and we still plan on having a big \u201creal\u201d wedding once we can afford it. When that moment comes I expect my friends and family to treat it like they would any other wedding. \n\nI got married during Covid pandemic. I got married before I could afford to do the things my wife and I wanted to do. If my best friend was like \u201cdamn, you didn\u2019t invite me to your courthouse wedding, fuck you\u201d Id be very disappointed in them. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go to Columbia either, though. I\u2019m frankly afraid to travel to South America due to my fear of being a cartel target (probably a stupid fear). But if he\u2019s celebrating with you in whatever country you are from, yeah you probably should get him a wedding gift.

Seems like they may be feeling a bit neglected by their friends, like their marriage somehow doesn\u2019t \u201ccount\u201d as much because they went the nontraditional route.", "Maybe we all should start using the bachelorette card even while single to get free vacations\u2026", "They had a courthouse ceremony. Courthouses can be very strict about the amount of guests, assuming they allow them at all. And by amount, it's usually about 10 max. A lot of people choose to go alone or limit to just parents in order to avoid hurt feelings. That's what my little sister did. She was super apologetic about it later, but we all reassured her that no one was upset. We were just grateful she was marrying such a nice guy, as he's legit the best person she ever dated. My little sister also did an immediate family dinner afterwards, as that way she didn't have to worry about upsetting her friends or coworkers.  The bachelor party seems a bit silly to me, as he's now already married. The destination is also kind of pricey. I can sort of understand it as a friends trip, though.\n\n Any case, OP is perfectly within his rights to stay home and even to deny a wedding gift, but he needs to decline these carefully if he wants to continue the friendship. This just feels a bit too much like sour grapes, like he was upset that he wasn't at the wedding or immediate family dinner.", "I also have to wonder: how did the friend ask for wedding gifts? Was it a case of him effectively demanding gifts or did he phrase it as something that would be optional, but appreciated? OP seems to have taken it as demanding a gift, but he's also looking at this with hurt feelings. \n\nOP, I recommend that if you're hurt, that you talk to your friend about this. Let him know that you love and support him, but that you really felt left out because you considered him family.", "I don\u2019t trust OP\u2019s characterization of this request. Did the groom actually request this or did he make an offhand statement/joke about gifts?\n\nSo do you believe it\u2019s also wrong to ask for gifts before a wedding, which pretty much everyone does?\n\nEither way, if you\u2019re a good friend you don\u2019t have a problem giving your friend a gift for an occasion like this. It doesn\u2019t matter if he asks. \n\nOne of my friends asked me to buy her something specific from her wedding registry bc she really wanted it and no one had purchased it, so I did. It\u2019s not a big deal.\n\nAlso, the issue here isn\u2019t that OP is upset with a gift request, he\u2019s upset bc he didn\u2019t get to attend the wedding first. Presumably he has no issue with being asked to give a gift if he gets a wedding invite. This is irrational bc no one was invited to the wedding.", "I thought it was pregegant \ud83e\udd23", "I mean. Why? Who says we all have to be constrained by traditional wedding rules and enforce them on people? YTA for me, buy your best friend a gift", "Wrong OP is not upset that he wasn't invited to the wedding he is annoyed that his friend tries guilt him into a trip he don't want to go on and expect gifts . He is upset because his friend is using the we are friends for years and you guys don't want to spend tausands of dollars for a trip and use your vacation and leave your family alone for me . \n\nYou also don't ask for brithday gifts you either get one or you don't it is just expected to bring a brithday gift to a birthday party but it is not expect to give you gifts afterward .\n\nIt depends what kind of gifts he wants if he wants like $500 it is a total nogo I doubt he wants some plates", "Yeah, hosting a reception is a bit different than this, though. When my mom remarried, the ceremony was just her and my stepdad, and us kids. 2 months later they had a proper reception. But that's very different than holding a post-bachelor party, especially one far away from where everyone lives, knowing they have many commitments", "We're planning something similar. We got married in 2021, so it was immediate family only. We want to have an anniversary party eventually that will stand in for our wedding reception so we can still celebrate with our loved ones. We did get a lot of wedding gifts when we got married, though, so we'll specify no gifts for that party, I think.", "Maybe just me, but I think an after-the-fact anniversary party needs to automatically come with a \"No presents please. Only your presence is needed\" disclaimer. Otherwise, this just looks like the answer to the question, \"How can we get our friends and family to buy us a bunch of stuff?\" If you throw in a registry, it's just gross.", "You still invited your guests to a party that you paid for and fed and entertained them, and WANTED them to be a part of your union. \n\nThis is totally not that, lol.", "As long as you didn't tell your guests that you expected gifts, there is nothing wrong with having your ceremony and party afterwards. Also, it doesn't sound like you expected guests to spend money going  to a destination, like Cartegena. It sounds like OP's friend let people know that he expected gifts. That never looks good.", "There is a huge difference in what you did, and having a bachelor party (or any of the parties typically done before a wedding) well after the wedding happened. Especially an expensive destination bachelor party. What you did is pretty common actually, especially for those that don't want to deal with a big wedding but have a lot of family and friends that want to be able to celebrate with you.", "Well, we originally got married in secret.  So it was a full ceremony and reception and gifts and stuff.", "YTA. You weren't invited to go to a courthouse on a random Wednesday, and neither was anyone else. You weren't invited to a dinner that was small and only family, regardless of if you consider each other family. It's not as if you were singled out and left out of these events. If my BFF did this, he wouldn't even have to ask for a gift, I'd just show up with gifts and a bottle of Champaign.

You can elope and then you can later have a big party to celebrate. You just can't limit that party to family and then ask your friends to still give you gifts.", "I live in Las Vegas, and my long time partner and I don't feel the need to get married, but if we have to for whatever reason (primarily thinking as we get older and want the other person to be in charge if one of us has a major medical problem or something like that), we plan to do a courthouse wedding and a party here. Anyone who wants to come can, and there will be no hard feelings for those that can't.", "As another eloped person, also confirming", "My husband and I eloped, we didn't want any fuss.

He really doesn\u2019t tell us how his friend is making these requests. Is he demanding or just inviting people to join him?\n\nSorry, but this guy is being petty. He sounds like he\u2019d have zero issues with going to Colombia or giving a gift if these things occurred before the wedding and if he was invited to the wedding.\n\nAnd my point is giving a gift is about honoring a friendship and is not a ticket to an event.", "Many men take trips to Colombia to sleep with sex workers for very little US dollars unfortunately.

We did host a celebration party for all their friends and family. Never asked for gifts, just wanted to celebrate. They got many gifts anyway, but it was not required or even asked.

They are wedding gifts, gifts you give at the wedding.", "> did this friend get them all gifts for their weddings? \n\nIf he was invited to attend the other friends weddings, that is a moot point because he did not reciprocate. \n\n> Why does he have to spend thousands on a wedding before he\u2019s allowed to expect reciprocal gifts to celebrate his marriage? \n\nHe doesn\u2019t. He could have invited his friends to a potluck at the park to celebrate if he wanted. \n\n> Are you saying gifts are only an exchange for dinner? \n\nNo the gifts are a custom, meant to provide material items that will start the bride and groom off well in their new life together. It\u2019s also considered rude to not bring a gift to a birthday party, does that mean anyone who celebrates their birthday is trading a party for gifts?  \n\n> Then why is it \u201cpolite\u201d to send a gift even if you can\u2019t attend the wedding?\n\nBecause the invitation is a gesture saying \u201cyou are a very important person in my life and I want you to celebrate this occasion with me.\u201d Bringing a gift is a part of celebrating the couple on their happy day. If you can\u2019t attend yourself you might choose to send a gift to acknowledge your care for the couple and your wish to be there, but it\u2019s not considered rude to not send a gift to a wedding you aren\u2019t going to. \n\nBottom line is that OPs friend did not consider him important enough to actually celebrate the wedding with, but still expects that OP does find him important enough to fork over money for an expensive trip and free stuff.", "How did he ask for a gift?!

But it sounds like the friend demands gifts and is guilt tripping them to join him on his trip even though it looks like the others have jobs and family etc and can't just leave on short notice . It doesn't sound like he doesn't want to give a gift it is the way his friends thinks he is entitled to gifts without having a party seems to bother OP .

That and cash obviously.\n\nAlso the same idea around \"showers\" whether they be bridal, bachelor, or baby.  If anything baby showers still make the most sense since most people don't have extra baby stuff lying around so getting baby shower gifts that are geared toward the new parents make sense.\n\nI do agree that for weddings, the tradition doesn't really fit anymore since most couples live together already and have all the items and/or (if they are throwing a huge wedding) have the means to purchase many of the things.
