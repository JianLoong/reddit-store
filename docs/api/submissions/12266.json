It was supposed to be the dream of the sons taking over the family business. I had the ability to work in every department, so over the course of the last 10 years I progressed to running the company. My brother, who worked harder than anyone else, floundered with any real responsibility. He was the ultimate task doer, but ask him to manage anyone or anything, and it would be a dumpster fire.\n\nMy parents would protect my brother by tying my hands behind my back in regards to saying anything bad to my brother about the quality of his work, or how he was failing at being a manager. My parents did not want his feelings to be hurt. My brother would get moved to a different department, or have his job description change so he wasn't in charge of anything that would hurt the company. They would never tell him he wasn't doing his job right, they would never tell him he sucked at his job. It was easier for  them to lie to him, so they could avoid any conflict or hurt feelings. \n\nI was complicit in this. I kept up the lies, I played the game. Resentments grew. My brother was still getting paid the same as me, I was running the company, at this point he was basically still in a entry level position. So 2 years ago I started a different company and left the family one. Less than a year later, my parents asked me to come back. I accepted on the condition that my brother would be bought out of the company. They agreed.\n\nSo with my brother being bought out, I am now running the company solo, we gave him a group of our customers that he now services under his own company name, life is good, or so I though.....\n\nI found out by one of my employees, that my brother has been stealing product out of our warehouse. They were under the impression that we had some sort of deal worked out with me because we were family. NOPE..... He was just plain stealing.\n\nSo when I confront my brother, he admits to stealing, but went off on this rant on how I never respected him, that I was the biggest asshole because I was mean, and on and on. So then and there I decided to stop lying, and essentially told him all of the lies from the last 10 years. How he got the short end of the stick because no one ever told him what he was doing wrong. How our parents just didn't want to hurt his feelings, but knew he couldn't run the company. I was done lying, I just sat there and told the truth.\n\nSo my parents are now mad at me because he's mad. Like MAD MAD, and he has gone no contact with them, and they are worried that they wont be able to ever see him or their grandchildren again.\n\nSo AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?", "created_utc": 1678797932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r55ki/aita_for_finally_telling_my_brother_the_truth_but/", "score": 231, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After a decade of being shuffled around and having responsibility removed from his job description, your brother never sat down at any point to ask critical questions like \u201cwhy am I being marginalized in this business while OP is being promoted?\u201d Brother needed to be an adult and think critically but just accepted the rote tasks that didn\u2019t include leadership? He\u2019s just dumb. There\u2019s an expiration date on how long an adult could allocate blame and say that others enabled them to act a certain way. He has to accept responsibility for his shit but he\u2019d rather throw a temper tantrum like a child, which absolves OP of being an asshole IMO. \n\nOP\u2019s parents are definitely assholes, though.
