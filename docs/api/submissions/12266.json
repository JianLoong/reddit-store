It was supposed to be the dream of the sons taking over the family business. I had the ability to work in every department, so over the course of the last 10 years I progressed to running the company. My brother, who worked harder than anyone else, floundered with any real responsibility. He was the ultimate task doer, but ask him to manage anyone or anything, and it would be a dumpster fire.\n\nMy parents would protect my brother by tying my hands behind my back in regards to saying anything bad to my brother about the quality of his work, or how he was failing at being a manager. My parents did not want his feelings to be hurt. My brother would get moved to a different department, or have his job description change so he wasn't in charge of anything that would hurt the company. They would never tell him he wasn't doing his job right, they would never tell him he sucked at his job. It was easier for  them to lie to him, so they could avoid any conflict or hurt feelings.\n\nI was complicit in this. I kept up the lies, I played the game. Resentments grew. My brother was still getting paid the same as me, I was running the company, at this point he was basically still in a entry level position. So 2 years ago I started a different company and left the family one. Less than a year later, my parents asked me to come back. I accepted on the condition that my brother would be bought out of the company. They agreed.\n\nSo with my brother being bought out, I am now running the company solo, we gave him a group of our customers that he now services under his own company name, life is good, or so I though.....\n\nI found out by one of my employees, that my brother has been stealing product out of our warehouse. They were under the impression that we had some sort of deal worked out with me because we were family. NOPE..... He was just plain stealing.\n\nSo when I confront my brother, he admits to stealing, but went off on this rant on how I never respected him, that I was the biggest asshole because I was mean, and on and on. So then and there I decided to stop lying, and essentially told him all of the lies from the last 10 years. How he got the short end of the stick because no one ever told him what he was doing wrong. How our parents just didn't want to hurt his feelings, but knew he couldn't run the company. I was done lying, I just sat there and told the truth.\n\nSo my parents are now mad at me because he's mad. Like MAD MAD, and he has gone no contact with them, and they are worried that they wont be able to ever see him or their grandchildren again.\n\nSo AITA for finally telling my brother the truth, but throwing my parents under the bus to do so?\n\nEDIT: To add to more information to this story, it was not like my brother was thrown into a situation without training. We provided informal training on how to learn more about the business (Like this is how we do the books, come with me on the jobsite so I can show you this). Formal training both trade specific and management courses. He was not thrown to the wolves, he just never cared to pick it up, or try to step up. \n\nI left the company because of the toxic environment and all of the built up resentments.\n\nI came back to the company because my parents retirements are tied to the company and without a son to run it or a sale, they would have lost everything. I still run the other company I started.\n\nLast, I knew I was an asshole for what I did to my brother. When I told him the truth, I was also apologizing to him for my part in all of it. I was asking if I was the asshole for throwing my parents under the bus in the truth/apology.", "created_utc": 1678797932, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r55ki/aita_for_finally_telling_my_brother_the_truth_but/", "score": 1351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were wrong for being complicit for all these years, but a family that doesn't/won't survive the truth isn't much of a family.  My advice is to sit down with your brother (let him cool off first) and just be honest with him in a way that isn't an attack.  You said he's a hard worker - that's a great place to start.  Not everyone is management material and there's no reason to think everyone needs to be.  Tell him the truth and explain that your parents' hearts were in the right place even though they mishandled the situation.  Next, you need to engage with your parents and explain their missteps in this situation.  You can't go back in time, but they can/should admit their mistakes and move forward from the situation and try to be more honest regarding this situation.", "If your family and yourself were honest with him to start he could've contributed better to the company (depending on how he would have received the feedback). But  it could've helped him a ton if he knew what his misgivings are so he can actively work on it OR switch to a specific position within the company that highlights his strengths. \n\nEveryone really sucks in this situation but I hope you guys can walk forward together and learn from this. I am sure it will take your brother time, you genuinely dropped a 10 year old bomb on him, he probably needs time to process it. Your parents should've known better and you too OP.", "He went off on a rant for getting caught stealing.  I'd ignore it and call the police next time.", "ESH", "Cool motive, still stealing. \n\nNTA.

Don't be a party to stupid lies for a decade. ESH", "ESH. You don't suck for telling the truth, or for \"throwing your parents under the bus\" though - he was owed that a long time ago. And now presumably his stealing is because with his management skills it would be the only way to make a success of his new business. If he had known about his muck ups sooner perhaps he would have realised he isn't management material and gone a different route in life. That being said, obviously stealing is wrong and no amount of cluelessness about how bad he was within your company would make it OK for him to think otherwise. My husband's family was in a similar situation with his brother and it was like watching a dumpster fire being put out and reignited over and over again and all the time saying well what do you expect if you never TELL him what he gets wrong?", "NTA.  At this point, there's no option other than to tell the truth.", "NTA Your parents infantilized your brother repeatedly by not holding him accountable in any of his failures and set him up for failure. Had they held him accountable he would, hopefully, have learned and grown from the experience. And they made you complicit. It\u2019s a shame you couldn\u2019t be honest about this much sooner. You did have a choice to not go along with your parents and spill the beans early on, but to keep the peace, you went along with it. This was bound to come out eventually.", "Except, OP was not the ultimate boss. He was running the company, his parents were running the show. In my mind he didn't \"fail\" his brother. He did what he was supposed to do according to the owner's wishes. \n\nThat the brother was incompetent is not his cross to bear, or story to re-write.", "I got the strong impression that the brother would rather be happy in a subject matter expert role than manager.

But nope, instead they promoted brother into a position of nonsense.", "I don't even grasp.\nHow is it possible that he would not realize that he was failing to get results wherever he worked during TEN years ?? Like, every single employees were master actors , completely obediants to the parents and did not let slip anything ? And he never opened a results sheet ?", "Damn yeah all of that. They suck but the brother not noticing how much he was fucking up, what was he doing all day? And now, he has no real knowledge on anything and knows it, there is a really good chance he'll be back at the company when he's out of money.", "I can\u2019t imagine how betrayed the brother must be feeling. To be told he\u2019s doing right all along, and then to find out that the whole family thinks he sucks at his job and never bothered to help him improve. That\u2019s just really hard to hear. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he never talked to any of his family again.", "I question if they would have made an amazing team\u2026 OP\u2019s brother justified his theft by saying OP had been mean to him. This is after the brother received a buy out and was set up with customers so he could begin his own company. It screams entitlement and says a lot about the brothers overall character.", "This is an important point. They never gave the brother the necessary feedback to improve. They, parents and OP, tied the brother's hands more than OP feels his parents tied his. So as far as the brother knows, he's been doing exactly what he's supposed to be doing but gets kicked out of the family business because OP wants it that way.\n\nThis doesn't excuse the brother's stealing, but I completely understand his anger. ESH", "> Getting feedback is an important part of being a working adult, no one is perfect at everything\n\nI would argue that kid brother has just received that valuable feedback you are referring to. It might not have been done in the kindest manner; but then again, we'll give OP some slack given that kid brother was in the process of stealing from him.\n\nRegardless of what prompted the revelation, kid brother now has honest feedback on his performance. Is kid brother using that feedback as motivation to improve his poor performance? Hell no! Kid brother took his marbles and went home. Kid brother is never coming back to the playground. Maybe, just maybe, this attitude is why OP and the parents didn't previously give kid brother honest feedback on his performance. \n\nOP and his parents were likely not malicious. They probably hoped that they could keep the business running despite kid brother's dead weight. That their good intentions could overcome kid brother's incompetence. After all, they paid kid brother the same as OP, despite the fact that OP is competent. \n\nIt is naive to blame this situation on the fact that kid brother never received feedback. The proof of the pie is in the pudding -- when kid brother received honest feedback, he went ballistic. \n\nActually, the fact that kid brother is the type of person who thinks it is ok to steal from big brother is another red flag when it comes to his personality (he lacks integrity). Kid brother is a weak willed incompetent who was lucky enough to be born into a family where they carried his dead weight for years, paying him far more than his contributions were worth. His family did so because they loved him, not out of maliciousness.\n\nNTA", "10/10", "According to OP, brother received both personal assistance on learning various things about the business as well as formal training and either didn't absorb it or blew it off.

OP recognized his complicity in hiding brother's poor job performance eventually.

So he cannot soley be responsible.  \n\n The brother thought the moving him on was because he was not the golden child.", ">My brother, who worked harder than anyone else\n\nOps brother did the right thing, and he was lied to  about what was happening.

They need someone outside themselves to help them think critically about how their behavior effects their workers, and they need refreshers on it every so often.  Whether that's being actively mentored, self guided periods of reflection where they read books and really think about their current situation and style, or some type of retreat/workshop programs where they can learn new skills...  every leader needs support to be really great.\n\nAnd you see that so often when people complain about their bosses.  So few bosses truly embrace that developing and supporting their staff benefits both the staff and the company!\n\nSo OP may think he's the best boss in the world, but not giving his brother feedback, and not actively working with his brother to tailor a position where he could actually succeed, make OP a bad boss too.

Which makes the dynamic surrounding flagrantly disobeying them in a way that could cause family drama actually poses a pretty sincere risk to OP and his livelihood.\n\nOnce again, I agree he sucks.

I know not every workplace is like that, but OP, as the person running the company, certainly could have instilled collaboration as a company ethos.
