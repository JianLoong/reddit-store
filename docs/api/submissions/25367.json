I work from home and don't need to wake up until about 8:30am. I enjoy sleeping in until then. \n\nIt fucking maddens me that her alarm goes off constantly from 5am-6am and destroys my sleep and my morning. I've brought this up with her and she's defended the habit and refused to quit because (1) she says it's the only way she can get up in the morning, and (2)  she has to drive to work for a job that starts much earlier than mine, and I work from home, so I should be accommodating to her and empathetic that she has to wake up so early and drive. After months of this I told her that the next time her snooze went off, I'd turn off her alarm on her phone. \n\nThis morning, I did that at 5am and reached over and just turned off the alarm on her phone after she hit snooze the first time. She slept through to about 6:40am, woke up, freaked out, and ended up about 10 minutes late to work. She is furious at me. But I insist I am right and I will do the same thing tomorrow.

I didn't used to be able to get up on my first alarm either, and then I realized that 7 hours of good sleep and 1 hour of shitty sleep was actually making me wayyy more tired in general because I was basically going off less sleep than a person needs for years.

I started getting 8 hours of good sleep and \\*everything\\* got better because I wasn't a tired crab anymore. The fact that gf was able to get up on the first try at 6:40 am means she doesn't really need a full hour of snooze, she is perfectly capable of hopping out of bed at the first alarm when there are real time related consequences.

Did he never sleep over before?", "I can't answer that. I don't know their relationship. But even if that's the case should it really take months for a change. \n\nIf you were OP partner and for months their telling you, your alarm is messing with my sleep schedule. Would you A. Find a solution or B go months of telling them to suck it up. \n\nLet's say 3 months 5 days a week that's 60 times he dealt with this and her refusing to address it.
