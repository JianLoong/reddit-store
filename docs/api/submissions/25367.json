I work from home and don't need to wake up until about 8:30am. I enjoy sleeping in until then. \n\nIt fucking maddens me that her alarm goes off constantly from 5am-6am and destroys my sleep and my morning. I've brought this up with her and she's defended the habit and refused to quit because (1) she says it's the only way she can get up in the morning, and (2)  she has to drive to work for a job that starts much earlier than mine, and I work from home, so I should be accommodating to her and empathetic that she has to wake up so early and drive. After months of this I told her that the next time her snooze went off, I'd turn off her alarm on her phone. \n\nThis morning, I did that at 5am and reached over and just turned off the alarm on her phone after she hit snooze the first time. She slept through to about 6:40am, woke up, freaked out, and ended up about 10 minutes late to work. She is furious at me. But I insist I am right and I will do the same thing tomorrow.

I started getting 8 hours of good sleep and \\*everything\\* got better because I wasn't a tired crab anymore. The fact that gf was able to get up on the first try at 6:40 am means she doesn't really need a full hour of snooze, she is perfectly capable of hopping out of bed at the first alarm when there are real time related consequences.

I wake up at 6 and look at the clock and my brain is immediately happy that \"oh good, it's only 6, I get 15 more minutes\".  I can't just sleep those extra 15, it's like I have to \"know\" that I get them.  If I forget to set my 6am alarm and only wake up with the 6:15 one, it's like my morning is fucked because I didn't get \"my extra 15\".  I mean technically I did, but I didn't get my little brain teaser so It doesn't feel like I did.  \n\nBut I only do 2.  It's not constant snoozing for an hour.

I used to be like the girlfriend (and I am still not a morning person). My hubby and I came to a compromise. I get to hit snooze twice maximum. It's a compromise because when he works his alarm would off at 430am (6am start onsite) and wake me up. I didn't have to be up with the kids until 7am so because he woke me up every morning he worked, he out up with my 3 alarms (2snooze then get up) on his week days off when the kids have school.\n\nOP, I am only saying ESH because yours isn't a solution or compromise.

If I have to be out of bed at, say 6:00 am, I'll set an alarm for 5:30 so I can snooze a couple times, allowing me to doze for a bit and wake up properly, but with the safety catch of knowing that if I DO fall back asleep, the alarm will rewake me. \n\nHaving said that, I live and sleep alone, so there's nobody bitching about it near me.

I am perfectly capable of getting up,  shutting off an alarm across the room, and getting back into bed without actually becoming conscious if I've walked that pathway even a couple times. I'll have no memory of doing it. If you're a hard to wake person you really do need multiple alarms or a job that works better with your natural sleep cycle. \n\nAlso making sure the alarm is set to coincide at a natural end to your sleep cycle can help make them feel less torturous.

Insane to passive-aggressively jeopardize someone's job like that.", "They both need to find a compromise or not sleep together, fully agree on that. As someone who absolutely uses multiple alarms to wake up because my natural rhythm is to be up late and sleep in I do empathize with that, but I also sleep alone. Where I lean more that OP is in the wrong than his gf is that rather than work on a compromise or ask, \"hey babe, I recognize that waking up is hard, but it's also not fair to me to be woken up ever 5 minutes between 5 and 6, could we work on you maybe just working with two or three alarms at 5:30, 5:45, and 6:00?\" He said, \"nah fuck this and fuck you, you either wake up with the first alarm tomorrow or idgaf.\" \n\nIt's rules vs boundaries. OP can set the boundary of, \"I don't want to sleep in a room where I'm woken up by a barrage of alarms for an hour.\" His options without being a controlling asshole in reinforcing that boundary are ALL changing his behavior, i.e sleeping somewhere else and if the problem continues and his gf shows no empathy deciding if this is an issue worth ending the relationship over or otherwise problem solving. His whole approach was that he didn't like a behavior so he tried to get her to change it, that's a rule. Rules in a relationship need to be agreed upon mutually. Your boundaries dictate your behavior, not anyone else's. \n\nNone of which is to say the GF wasn't also being selfish by not seeking a solution that helped them both, but at no point did she force him to sleep in the same room as her, he did, however, provide her with an ultimatum that either she comply with his wishes or he would sabotage her system. Both are toxic, but OP is more so imo based on the account he gave.", "You have no idea if she may a medical condition as the reason she does that.

I don't think it's OP's responsibility to wake her up (every day waking an adult would be maddening), but that type of alarm clock might help. \n\nMaybe she should go to bed earlier or see a doctor for her sleep issues if she is sleeping a reasonable amount of hours.", "Yeah I used to do this, set my alarm for earlier than I needed but I stopped when I moved in with my partner because I recognized how unfair it was to him.

Going to sleep earlier might help her arouse into wakefulness quicker. Limiting screen time before bed allows for better quality sleep. Experimenting with other means of being woken up (eg light instead of sound, a vibrating watch, or even the air temperature in the room). Changing the actual alarm sound (I have to do this every few months because my brain gets used to specific alarms and it won\u2019t really wake me up after a while). \n\n- Partner moves to couch upon first alarm so her subsequent alarms don\u2019t wake you. This might also help her get up sooner.\n\nThere\u2019s probably some more solutions I haven\u2019t even thought of. Idk why these people are at a stalemate.

If she can't wake up otherwise, she can't wake up. Turning her alarm off and sabotaging her career is a big AH move. Now she has to live in fear of losing her job if she can't magically wake up with one alarm.\n\nMy exhusband was like this. He just couldn't wake up. It was one of the annoying things that I *didn't* mind. I would just wake him up if the alarm annoyed me and I wanted to turn it off. \n\nOP could have woken her up at 6am.
