Also you were perfectly fine missing out one year when it suited your needs so I guess your parents saw it as such. \n\nAlso what I don't understand it, what if your b-day falls on Monday, isn't the previous weekend closer technically . Why do you insist so much on that particular one ?", "NTA, but mostly because of the unfair treatment, as normal b-days arent that important after say you\u2018re 20, but considering your sister and brother, nah you deserve a b-day", "NTA if everyone is getting their \"special day\" except you, but this all sounds a *little* too co-dependent tbh.", "I'm inclined to say NAH but you will be if you push this issue too much. Honestly the older I get, the less I care about celebrating my birthday and needing other people to go out of their way to celebrate me. It's a nice family tradition in theory but at some point you'll grow out of it. Surprised you haven't already.\n\nDon't make them cancel their trip and try to plan a date that works for everyone. Who cares if you celebrate on the actual day you were born.", "YTA.  You\u2019re 24 years old.  Celebrate on a different day.", "yta bro you're 25 you're a little too old to be demanding your parents attention like that. like you're the one who started this by not showing up for your 23rd you had no problem ditching mommy and daddy then. but now that they started their own tradition you wanna throw a tantrum wah I only get dinner wah", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re not an AH for wanting to make plans with your family, but someone who is turning 25 should not care this much about their birthday.", "Nta.  If your parents can avoid plans for 2 days a year, then 3 days shouldn't be the problem. Are your siblings the golden and silver children?", "NAH\nIt's ok to feel slighted, but your parents adjusting their priorities a bit now that all the kids are away and you should too.\n\nAsking for an event like your sibs get is fine and fair, but accept another weekend", "It would be NAH if the parents weren\u2019t prioritizing the entire family being together for his siblings\u2019 birthday.
