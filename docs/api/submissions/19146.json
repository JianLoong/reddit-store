If you want to take the baby for a few hours here or there, that's amazing and nice.  But it should never be an expectation that you \"work a shift\" while you're visiting.  \n\nI'd have a very transparent conversation with her NOW about why you are coming out and that you will not be watching the baby overnight or getting up early for this - especially since BOTH of the baby's parents will be there.  If it's that much of an issue for her that her guest will not do this, consider staying at a hotel instead.  Or not going.", "NTA but for the love of god, have a direct and honest conversation with your sister so there are no bad feelings or overblown emotions. Just _tell_ her that you are not comfortable caring for the baby alone when everyone else is asleep for the first shift, but that you are more than happy to do whatever else is needed.

As much as you love visiting, night shifts is something you aren't comfortable with.\n\nIt's awesome that some people are willing to do night shifts. (My mom and dad did them with my nieces) But your sister needs to understand that (1) this is your vacation, you could be lounging on a couch at home- not watching her child and (2) any help with your kid is a gift. Whether it's time, money, or a present.\n\nYou can either say thank you or that isn't help that I need but thank you for offering to help.\n\nThere are only 2 choices. Not that \"that isn't the help I want.\"", "NTA it is entitled to expect guest to take care of your child in the middle of the night.\n\nIf you go next week you will be required to get up with the baby. She has already made it crystal clear what she expects from you. So you have two options let her know now your not getting up or\nTaking early morning shifts.  Or post pone your trip telling her something come up with work and you won\u2019t be able to make it. Or stay in a hotel and not her home would be another option. \n\nShe is not joking she expects you to get up with the baby. Which is extremely entitled.", "NTA. You need to stand up for yourself here. Don't let her \"joke\" her way into manipulating you. \n\nShe says \"in addition to the mornings?\"\n\nYou say, \"In addition to nothing.\"\n\nAnd mean it.

I will make dinner/lunch/breakfast for everyone so they can focus on baby routine but I didn\u2019t make the child.", "At this point the baby is 9 months old.

The line varies but I think it\u2019s after the baby sleeps through the night.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's very rude to expect people to take care of your children, even if they are family. Tell her no or stop going to visit.", "Honestly OP you\u2019re NTA for your perspective here and it\u2019s lovely how you speak of your nephew.  Many folks wouldn\u2019t make the effort you have or feel so attached.\n\nIt would probably be a good idea to make sure your sister knows you take these comments as jokes though.  \u201cWhat a knee-slapper!\u201d or \u201ca supermom AND a comedian, wow!\u201d would kind of toss it back to her and let her know you\u2019re not taking that bait.  \n\nIf your company and affection aren\u2019t enough for them to want you there, that very much sounds like their loss.", "NTA\n\nOffer to run her errands to the grocery store if she wants help.", "What other people are willing to do when they visit is entirely on them. The ability and willingness to do the same is up to each visitor. With her jokes and comments, it's clear that your sister would love to have you follow suit but you're under no obligation to do so.\n\nSister and her husband wanted a child, so they get to take care of the child. If you're willing to take up some of the slack while you're visiting, that's pretty nice of you, but it shouldn't be a requirement for visiting. Their expectation that you do so borders on entitlement, but it's hard to say they're the A H because they may just be overwhelmed with all the parenting responsibilities they didn't realize they'd have.\n\nOf course you could always visit your family and stay at a hotel to define a clear separation of time commitments and substitute parenting duties.\n\nNAH", "Just don\u2019t go", "NTA.

So stop visiting.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't birth the baby, not your responsibility. She's just entitled.", "NTA. This is not your child, and therefore not your responsibility. While it is nice for the parents to get a break now and then, it takes brass balls to demand a visitor take a shift watching their baby. If a guest offers, that's something else entirely.", "NTA at all. They don\u2019t want a guest. They want childcare. \n\nAlso- the baby might not react well to a change in their routine. You can get away with that for the first 6 months or so, but eventually they will just want Mom/Dad and that middle of the night feeding won\u2019t go well for either of you.", "Just cancel the trip. You're a guest not a babysitter, smh. NTA", "NAH - I think you just need to have a conversation with her.

Instead of being grateful, she\u2019s starting to get entitled. \n\nIt\u2019s totally fine for a new mom to expect visitors to help out - they shouldn\u2019t be playing hostess when they\u2019re trying to get used to a new baby. The extreme on that end are visitors expecting to be waited on hand and foot while offering nothing of value. That\u2019s obviously not ok. But she doesn\u2019t get to demand people wake up early with her baby and let her sleep in either. \n\nI\u2019d be really honest and upfront with her about what you\u2019re willing to do and offer to come less frequently if she feels like hosting you is becoming burdensome. \n\nShe\u2019s new at this. She\u2019s being totally spoiled and she needs people to be clear about boundaries she\u2019s crossing so she can manage her expectations better.", "Not your circus, not your monkey.

Not your kid, not your wheelhouse, not your problem.", "NTA.  Sis is taking full advantage wherever she can.  Place that boundary hard and fast.", "If your sister wants a morning nanny, she should hire one.

I will forever adore my dad for the first time he stayed overnight after my first baby was born and told me to sleep in, just leave him prepared bottles.  He did it many times, especially when my second not only didn't sleep much but also had reflux.\n\nThat being said, it was 0% required, ever. No one was ever required to help, during the day or night, with my babies.  I think you should be clear that you're happy to help during daytime hours.
