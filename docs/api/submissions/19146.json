(My mom and dad did them with my nieces) But your sister needs to understand that (1) this is your vacation, you could be lounging on a couch at home- not watching her child and (2) any help with your kid is a gift.

Leaving a child with someone who is uncomfortable is also a recipe disaster.", "NTA. It\u2019s because you love your sister that you can tell her to F off with this ridiculous garbage.", "NTA\n\nbut looking after your nephew while sister and husband go on a date night is no different than looking after him in the morning. A baby if a few months old doesn\u2019t have much concept of the time.\n\nThat said, you should not feel guilted into looking after the baby in the morning if you don\u2019t want to (whatever the reason) say to your sister that you are not up for the morning shifts but you are happy to care for him during the day while she can have a nap", "I would 100% cancel my trip!", "Right. They\u2019re looking for free babysitting.", "So entitled of her. I think she's going to isolate herself. I assume she's not thought this through, or maybe she has and genuinely believes people will pay money to visit so they can get up at the crack of dawn to do free babysitting.\n\nI'd cancel my trip if it was me. If I couldn't, I'd get a hotel. I might or might not meet her!", "This is an absolutely reasonable statement and OP is absolutely NTA.  \n\nAt no point could I discern anything other than \u201cI\u2019m *not comfortable* taking care of an infant overnight/early hours.\u201d   There is zero indication that OP just wants to sleep in.   This is an important distinction (although I wouldn\u2019t judge for EITHER!).\n\nMe?  Gimme the babe, gimme third shift, gimme gimme GIMME!  Let me love the tiny little adorable monster back to sleep while Mom & Dad get some much-deserved rest.    *But that is ME, and only after a handful of niblings, the confidence to handle offering and the chance to love on wee little borrowed fingers and toes because I\u2019m not going to have any of my own.*. \n\nOP:  hold your ground.  There are a million different ways to love and support your sister and her family; this simply does NOT have to be one of them.", "She's been there for a week four times, in only 9 months! That's not a guest", "Yes,  I  agree. Am honest conversation will really help here. \n\nAnd you might end up with an airline voucher for a place that's even more fun", "NAH - I think you just need to have a conversation with her.", "This is the right reply. If you're going to visit as a guest, then you're adding work for her - even though you may not expect it, she will still likely be cleaning and cooking that she wouldn't do when guests arent there. If you're going and helping her with errands or cleaning/cooking, that's another story.", "Not only thst but the night shift! She expects someone whose baby it isn't to look after the baby overnight, which isn't reasonable to start with, but even worse to expect it of someone who's not experienced with babies.", "Yes, that bit is weird for me too", "Yea, I'd also add that hosting someone for a week is a lot of work in and of itself so I can understand how they might want a family member who is staying in their home to pitch in a bit more.\n\nWhile do think their sibling's expectation is beyond the realm of normal, OP has stayed at their place for over a month cumulatively in the past 9 months which is actually kind of a lot. They say they help out a lot during the day but I do wonder how much they're actually helping out vs. \"doing the fun things with the baby\" because it's easy for non-parents to feel like they're helping out while actually not being all that helpful.\n\n(ETA: To clarify I'm not a parent, I just know that all the fun things I do to watch the babies in my life pale in comparison to the work their parents put in)", "Surprised I had to scroll this far for someone to ask this. OP may inadvertently be making extra work for her sister on all these visits. It sounds like a lot especially for a new parent.", "I watch my nephew while his mother is busy with her toddler and i swear every time i get this boy, he laughs and smiles and then within an hour he's asleep on me. Totally content. I joked with her that I'm the baby whisperer because it was very similar to her first child (who once somehow took four naps on me despite hating naps) and my husband just goes: i hope our kid is similar when he comes out.\n\nI love kids and would do it for anyone. But, that doesn't mean I'll take it when people volunteer me to do it (i dig my heels in at that point)", "I read that as 4 visits totalling 1 week overall (i.e. usually spending the night and leaving the next day), not 4 whole weeks", "They are free to be exhausted.  But they chose to have a kid.  They don\u2019t have any right to ask someone else to exhaust himself with their baby.", "Oh they can, all 4 of mine have slept through the night since 6-8 weeks old, except #4, he wanted a 3 AM feeding and that was it, chiropractor and sleep training", "Yes!  External\u2026 expectation and outright volunteering are NOT the same thing.", "Nope, I read it as each visit was at least a week.", "Op needs to clarify this !? I was not sure which she meant as the time frame.", "I completely agree that no one should expect any guest to do the night routine for them! But to be dismissive and say that every 9 month old should absolutely be sleeping through the night is dismissive of parents who do not have the easiest of children.", "Well, as a parent of 4, clearly you have parented all variations of children \ud83d\ude44", "What kind of skeletal problems like arthritis or impact injuries or muscle strains did an infant have that he needed a chiropractor?  That\u2019s very young.  Maybe his congenital issue affected his sleep needs?"]}
