Maybe sister is just tired of being a \"hotel\" and no one is listening when she says she either needs help or don't come.", "I am so baffled that so few people have said something like this. My guess - sis lives in a vacation spot (the warm weather comment) and OP has been using \"visiting sis\" as a way to get free accommodations. My other guess is that OP has NOT been helping sis much at all, and what sis is really saying here is \"I am not your free hotel.\"", "Exactly!

Watching the baby for 15 hours every day for a week or however long the visit is!?!? That's being a nanny. \n\nOP, for Christ's sake, you're the uncle, not the nanny. Tell your sister that and tell her that her expectations of ***guests*** have gone completely off the rails.

Going to see the baby does not automatically include changing diapers, taking on feeding times, offering to be babysitter for date nights, etc. Which are things OP has done in the past and is offering to do now.\n\nWhen you go to see a baby, you are not offering immediately to take on waking up in the middle of the night or waking up super early in the morning to watch them and take care of them.

She\u2019s not only refusing overnights (which I understand) but also mornings (6-9am).

During normal hours that a babysitter would be available for, like date nights, and also helps out during the daytime during normal hours. The only thing she doesn't want to do is take on middle of the night shifts and super early morning shifts on her own. That is totally reasonable.

That\u2019s a wonderful support network she has where majority of her guests are helping, she should be extremely grateful for people taking the morning shift since most people wouldn\u2019t do that. \n\nYou don\u2019t feel comfortable with all that responsibility which is fair, so say that. She\u2019s entitled to think guests should go THAT far to help out. \n\nI will say, a lot of relatives tend to want to see the baby and end up making it more difficult for the parents who now have to cater to the baby and additional guests. As long as you\u2019re helping in some way and not burdening them with your presence, you\u2019re NTA", "I feel like I need more info but as someone with a 6mo I\u2019m leaning TA. Honestly I am not sure who the retired work mentor is to them to have come and stayed but having your in-laws, the grandparents, come and offer to take night and/or morning shifts is definitely not something crazy. For myself my family is a 4hr plane ride and no one has asked or been invited to come and tbh that still would be a lot even at 6mo so you going 4x already with another trip planned for at least a week each visit (if that\u2019s what\u2019s you meant not a cumulative week,) so potentially longer and that baby is only 9 months is crazy to me. \n\nAre you invited or are you calling to say hey my work is flexible again and I have free time to come? Now not gonna lie if someone calls me up and says they want to stay with me while I have this baby I may assume it\u2019s to help cause I would feel that staying with us with an infant implies this isn\u2019t a vacation you\u2019re gonna be put to work but that\u2019s me and tbh I wouldn\u2019t let someone stay with me anyway, too stressful right now. \n\nNow on the topic of people expecting work from friends and family to me it\u2019s not as simple as saying they are entitled. If you offer/agree to stay with someone who just had a baby I feel it\u2019s reasonable to assume you are there to help the parents and that may look like stuff you don\u2019t want to do the stuff that isn\u2019t \u201cfun\u201d so again I wanna know how the trips come to happen who is calling who and are you going to help or to vacation? Assuming you didn\u2019t stack all those trips within the last few weeks you were going maybe during the early weeks, end of newborn phase, the 4 month sleep regression, 6 month teething etc and it\u2019s nice to think you may be helping but if your helping isn\u2019t really all that helpful, for someone staying in their house for days honestly it sounds like a subtle hint they would like more in return for your week+ long visits.  There may be resentment building you come to visit and the ask is \u201ccan you watch your nephew during this 3hr window so I can get more sleep?\u201d You already are awake for 2hrs of that 3hr window could you get up 1hr earlier? You say you aren\u2019t comfortable watching him early or at night even though the parents are there just sleeping why do you feel more comfort babysitting while the parents are gone than if they are in the house a shout away if something went wrong? In a 3hr window in the morning you likely would do all those things you find \u201cfun\u201d like giving a bottle, likely 1 maybe 2 diaper changes and then playing. \n\nHonestly if the reason you go is to help your sister and you can\u2019t even wake up an hour earlier which is what she says would actually be helpful you likely aren\u2019t going there to help your sister just enjoy the location so just stay in a hotel.

They shouldn't dictate *when* you help.", "I have so many questions for the sister: first of all what kind of person are you? \ud83d\ude02 were you not taught manners???? \n\nHave a direct conversation with her: \"Hey I'm pretty sure your joking, but to be clear I am not comfortable taking a \"morning shift\" alone with your infant.\"\n\n\"But in laws-\" \"Oh you mean people who have fully raised children and understand the needs of a barely awake infant?

I don't want someone with minimal baby experience taking care of my baby first thing in the morning..... I'd rather they play with them. Sometimes mornings can be stressful, baby wakes up, starving, maybe a poopy diaper, maybe leaked pee diaper. That's a lot of responsibility.", "NTA. Your sister seems entitled. Making it mandatory guests watch her baby. She's going to make people not want anything to do with her or the baby. Find a motel or only visit during the day.", "Most babies have a sleep regression & developmental leap around 9 months. It is exhausting. However, I would never ask someone besides my husband to take that shift. Entertain baby so I can shower and nap? Absolutely. But those late nights/early mornings are for parents.", "NTA, talk to her about being uncomfortable, \nand that it wasn't going to happen. But maybe plan up stay at a hotel nearby, just in case?", "We have a four-month-old baby. We've been lucky enough to have both grandmothers and an aunt (my sister) volunteer to take night shifts to let us rest. We always express our deepest gratitude, and we make sure to check multiple times to make sure that this is really something they want to do.\nWe absolutely do not expect anybody other than ourselves to have a responsibility to take care of our boy, but we appreciate all help we get, and we know that his grandmothers and aunts, and other friends of ours want to help, and that they genuinely like it (in moderate amounts at least). \nWe know we are lucky. \n\nHowever, the thought of demanding this kind of help... The sheer entitlement baffles me! \nWe chose to have our child. He is our responsibility. \n\n\nBut. \nIf someone invites themselves to visit, I (we) don't have the extra capacity to be hosting the way we would before we had our baby (and became more or less permanently exhausted), so I will not be making you food, unless we happen to have to make it anyways, and if our home is messy, you better not mind. And if you do mind, help or don't mention it at all. \n\nIn summary, they are never entitled to your help. You just don't get to add extra work to their burden. As long as you don't, you're good and they shouldn't expect you to take the hardest shifts.", "This is not normal. \n\nStay at a hotel.", "NTA. Set a boundary, discuss it with your sister and BIL and let her know your not visiting ti be her nanny. Explain the times you\u2019re willing ti help out and for how long each day.

Seems like the exact sort of halfway-facetious venting joke you would make to a sibling.", "Instead of talking to your sister? The way this post reads, OP and sis keep just dancing around the issue. This feels like a good ole \"actually communicating could solve this problem\" situation.", "I think the difference as someone with a 9mo is is she asking what they need help with or just doing what she thinks is helpful during all these week long visits? (Also are they visits to help or vacation that\u2019s totally different but let\u2019s assume each visit is specifically to help)\n\nIf she visits to help (impactful help) maybe spending time giving a bottle or changing a diaper during the day isn\u2019t helpful maybe sis is trying to say hey this is what is impactful you watching him 6-9a (in an ideal world if that was true she would say \u201cforget all the day stuff this is what I need\u201d) so in that case assigning that is important or else you could have all those people in your house doing things they think are helpful but nothing feels helpful to you. To me it all comes down to why is she there is it specifically to help? And if so talking about what is needed, assigning what would be the most helpful, and hey if she actually doesn\u2019t want to do those things they can discuss ok what can you do and then say ok still come or actually let\u2019s have you over a different time.", "Sure, they could do better at communicating. But sis is 100% angling for free babysitting. And not just free babysitting of the afternoon or evening out sort. No. She wants someone to take the hard hours of midnights and 6am.
