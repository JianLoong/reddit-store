Respecting your significant other's sleep schedule is honestly the number one rule in my playbook. Honestly feels like he is calling because he's being insecure and worried you might not be picking up because he thinks you're cheating on him. Overall betamale behavior.\n\nAND REMEMBER If he can't respect your sleep schedule as your boyfriend, he won't do it as a husband either.", "NTA. This is a healthy boundary. He is a huge asshole to intentionally interrupt your sleep. Being drunk is no excuse.", "Oh, wow, what, you don\u2019t want to be awakened in the middle of the night by your drunk ass BF calling you up? \n\nWhat is wrong with you! Every girl should love to hear from her long distance sweetie four or five times in the middle of the night when she is trying to sleep because she has something important going on the next day! Because hearing drunk ass ramblings from her sweetie should be the highlight of her day! And her night! Indeed, she should lie in bed waiting for him to call, holding her breath in anticipation!

Your BF is the AH for not respecting you. Being drunk isn't an excuse to be an asshole.", "NTA - you turn it off on purpose when you sleep so you can sleep. You're not just blocking him, you're blocking ANYONE who would try to call you at those times.\n\nWhich is perfectly reasonable, once upon a time in the olden days there were no mobile phones and the expectation of being able to instantly contact anyone at any time wasn't a thing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

End of story.", "NTA at all. I\u2019d even be questioning why you are with him when he clearly has no respect for your needs", "NTA.  You have a boundary that you established that your bf doesn't respect voluntarily, so you 'helped' him meet your expectations.  It is a strange dynamic in your relationship that he didn't immediately apologize for causing you distress in the past, but instead got upset at you.  Maybe it's time to re-evaluate this relationship, don't you think?", "NTA, but he is. Not sure why you are staying with this guy, he gets drunk and drunk calls you , than gets mad because you don't answer his middle of the night calls. That is what voice mail is for.", "NTA\nYou are more entitled to sleep than drunk is to a phone call. He needs to manage his expectations here.", "NTA.  Beware of controlling behaviour.", "I use Do Not Disturb setting. I can set it automatically turn to DND every evening at the same time. Less hassle than turning the phone off", "NTA but why didn't you just tell him that you're turning it off? Of course he thought it was weird since previously you picked up.", "Nta but he is for repeatedly calling you while drunk. I had an ex who did that, problem was he was drunk at any given time of day, so it could be constantly disruptive. It took a while, but eventually left that relationship. \n\nSounds like you should have a conversation about your mutual needs.", "Unrelated but I can't un-see \"be-tamale\". Sound advice."]}
