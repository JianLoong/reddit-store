If the other half isn\u2019t being fulfilled then maybe you should take a step back and re-evaluate some things with him, especially as an athlete. Although relationships require two people, you should always value yourself more. Maybe you can find a compromise and find a way for you lot to attend to your both\u2019s needs i.e. clear apparent schedules of when he\u2019s drinking and your important events/training as an athlete.
