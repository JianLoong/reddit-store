Two years ago I got a rescue parrot who loves everyone in my family. He needs lots of attention so the arrangement for me to living \u201ccheaply\u201d with my mom for just watching my siblings worked out great. Here is where the issue comes in\u2026\n\nAbout 2 months ago my boyfriend\u2019s family decided they will be taking a international trip to their home country for 2 weeks in December and invited me. I asked my mom if there was a way she would be able to watch my bird during that time, she agreed but on the condition I would pay her an extra months worth of rent. That felt like a lot considering I watch my siblings everyday for 4 weeks and still pay a months worth of my regular rent, but I decided that was fine and agreed. HOWEVER, yesterday evening, until today, I went out with a friend to see a concert, therefore my mom offered to watch my bird (again at a price) and I went about my day and night.\n\nI got back about two hours ago, and the first thing she said to me was I better find someone else to watch my parrot from now on or she wants paid double the amount. I was blown back and asked her what happened, and all she could say was that he wanted out a lot, she had to clean up poop a lot, and she didn\u2019t like how much he\u2019d call her over to change out his food for something fresh (which she only did in the morning). Instantly she also begins complaining that is was tough enough watching the twins and watching my bird only added to the troubles. I blew up instantly when I saw that my bird\u2019s water had not been changed and his door was shut despite it being nowhere near his bedtime. \n\nI told my mom since this is what she considers to be something she deserves paid for, I will be expecting back pay for the last two years I have undercharged myself for watching her kids night and day while still paying her rent and working my butt off with college and a part time job. She quickly tried apologizing saying she was just stressed and that she\u2019s sorry but I shouldn\u2019t bring my babysitting into account because I\u2019m mad she won\u2019t babysit my bird. I quickly reminded her I give her children 3 meals a day, wake them up and put them to bed along with everything else and I still pay a good amount to live at home still, while she couldn\u2019t even make sure my bird had fresh water and I paid her! She tried to tell me if she wanted she can kick me out, and I told her gladly, that either way I\u2019ll take her for back pay one way or another. I ended the argument with saying until I\u2019m paid I will not watch her kids under any circumstances.\n\nMy grandmother and aunt now won\u2019t stop blowing up my phone saying I made my mom cry and how now she has no babysitter for tomorrow and the rest of the week.

Also, what amount of parenting is your mother doing if you are waking her kids up, getting them to school, and making sure they have 3 meals a day? A nanny of that stature would cost her over $1000 a month, and your still paying her $600 rent. In what world does over $1600 of rent, between the free labor and actual rent paid make sense, especially for her own daughter?\n\nYou probably won\u2019t get any back pay, seeing as there\u2019s no legal backing for you, but in my opinion you are absolutely NTA for requesting it.", "NTA. You need to look up how much a live-in babysitter gets paid. And find a bird-sitter who will take better care of your bird.", "NTA but moving out is the best action.", "NTA. Move out. Your mom will not pay you and you need to cut her off and stop expecting her to behave fairly.", "NTA. Your mom is trying to take advantage of you. Does your mom work a lot? Does she do ANYTHING for the kids?? If aunt and grandmother are so concerned, they can step up and watch the kids or help pay for a sitter. Your mom has been getting a hell of a deal for years and couldn't even replace the birds water one time? Is there any way you could move out?", "NTA - sounds like that was just the final straw in a long string of instances where she disrespected how much you are actually doing. I hope you can find a better living arrangement and someone else to watch your bird for you; I definitely wouldn't trust her after this.", "Your mom is gross, hustling you and transactional. Don\u2019t be like her.  You are NTA, but you need to go ahead and separate from her and start setting better boundaries for your future relationship.  Good luck.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA! I can\u2019t believe your Mom charges you any rent. Not while still attending college and while watching the younger kids. Sure she\u2019s stressed out, but you\u2019re her kid too!", "If you calculate childcare costs and the rent you pay it sounds like you are paying a good portion of your mom's mortgage. You should find an apartment with a roommate it would be cheaper. I bet your mom would guilt trip you because she NEEDS your rent money. Oh yeah NTA", "Wtf is wrong with ur mother. She makes u pay for doing stuff for her?", "Your mom's an AH for charging you $600/month rent and calling it cheap, for taking your money to care for your bird and then not caring for him, and not paying you for parenting her children.  You are NTA for telling her you want back pay.  Doubt you'll get it, but you can sure ask for it.", "NTA-I bet you could get a room somewhere a lot cheaper with more free time since you wouldn\u2019t be watching kids all the time.", "NTA \n\n1. Move out\n2. Find a reputable bird sitter or pet hotel for your bird", "You are NTA,  your mom is the AH", "Nope, NTA.  Find a roommate and move out of your mom\u2019s house. You can pick up a part time job if necessary and come out better. Your mom has forgotten how easy you\u2019ve made her life.  Reality and Karma have now landed in her lap.", "NTA. Your mom has taken advantage of you severely. If I were you, I'd be looking to move out and if she begs you to stay, you don't need to pay rent. I'm mad for you.", "NTA but I'd consider moving out at this point. She used you enough.", "Don\u2019t give her another dollar. Save and roommate with a friend if you need to!", "I\u2019m absolutely stunned that you\u2019re paying $600 a month for a room an shared communal spaces.

I hope you update with what your next steps are!", "NTA\n\nYou have to draw the line somewhere.

Tell your aunt & grandmother if they want to watch them for free they are welcome to volunteer.", "NTA  why are your grandmother and aunt involved? How childish of your mother to involve them to bully you. Just tell them both there's a babysitting job open for them. Start looking for a place - if you're near a college I'm sure someone is looking for a roommate - it will cost you the same but no free babysitting", "NTA, move out. Solution for your problems.

But you as well, for going back on a completely separate agreement in retaliation. \n\nI'd have been with you 100% if you'd just demanded payment back for care of your bird, as he wasn't actually taken care of, so insisting on a refund would be fully justified. But you agreed to watch your siblings for reduced rent separately, and never took any issue with that arrangement, so demanding a retroactive change makes you a bit of an AH. \n\nThat said, your mom is *way* overcharging you for pet care and *WAY* underpaying you for childcare. Live-in nannies get paid a salary, they don't get charged for rent. You are being exploited here, and I recommend you move out ASAP, or at least use this to leverage a lower rent (preferably zero) going forward.", "Awww did the oppressed rise up and tell the exploiters \u201cNo.\u201d? \n\nPoor exploiters, having to face the consequences of their own idiocy and greed. \n\nNTA.", "YTA.
