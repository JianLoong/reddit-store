We used to be pretty close friends, but over the last 2 years of living with him, we've drifted apart, and I'm just waiting for our lease to move out on my own.\n\nMatt's girlfriend \"Sarah\" pretty much lives with us, despite not paying rent. I won't lie, she annoys me to no end. She's an entitled airhead who thinks the world revolves around her. Anyway, Satah has a \"condition\" where she gets nauseous at the slightest smell and sight of certain foods. She's an incredibly picky eater and anything outside of corndogs or chicken tenders make's her nauseous according to her. Well unfortunately for her, I like to cook. I love heavily spiced foods and love to cook Asian-style dishes. So, living with a toddler who can't stand the smell really sucks. \n\nSarah has always complained about me cooking \"smelly\" foods and has asked me to stop or do it when she's \"not home.\" Well, considering she doesn't pay rent and spends 18 hours a day at my home I have not accommodated her at all. Last night, Sarah and Matt sat me down and told me I need to stop cooking because Sarah cannot stand it anymore. Apparently, she had a mental breakdown last week when I was cooking curry. She claims I am making our apartment a \"hostile environment\" by ignoring her concerns. I told both of them to piss off until Sarah starts paying her share of the rent. Matt said that because he lives here his opinion matters as well and he wants me to stop. I told him no to that as well because he's only doing this because Sarah is being a baby.\n\nWe ended up having a massive argument, and neither of them is talking to me both are staying at Sarah's mom's house right now. I say good riddance, at least I did until I told the story to my co-workers and they are all shocked. They say I am being a complete a-hole.

And while they're staying elsewhere, I guess you can cook as much as you want without the \"toddler\" throwing a fit.", "Roommates moving in a partner is the worst, you never agreed to live with her and obviously would not have agreed to since she's a massive asshole. NTA. Cook what you like, tell her to go home.", "NTA AT ALL!!!! What are your friends thinking, that you should stop cooking for yourself and eating AT YOUR OWN HOME to accommodate someone THAT DOESN'T EVEN PAY RENT AND SHOULDN'T BE THERE?", "NTA\n\nSounds like a win. She's finally gone.\n\nNow if your roommate is so desperate to be with her 24/7 and opts to pay his half of rent while living elsewhere....well, stupid is as stupid does.\n\nAs for your coworkers, they're ridiculous hypocrites. There is no way they would allow a freeloading squatter to move into their homes and dictate what they cook/eat.  And if they did....again...stupid is as stupid does.", "NTA!", "NTA and check your lease, sometimes they have rules about how many consecutive days \u201covernight guests\u201d can stay (at least the apartments I live in at college did).", "NTA! Sarah should go hang out at her own damn apartment, and Matt should go with her. You\u2019re entitled to cook meals in the kitchen you pay for.", "NTA.  \nOr, quite possibly,  Y T A for not cooking curry every friggin' night until your lease is up.", "NTA. You *are* only cooking when she\u2019s not home. She doesn\u2019t live with you, this when she\u2019s at your place, she\u2019s not home.", "NTA", "NTA! She\u2019s basically a squatter so as long as I pay rent I cook what I want.", "NTA. She\u2019s spoiled, demanding and entitled. If she doesn\u2019t like the smell of your food, she can go in Matt\u2019s bedroom, shut the door, open a window and burn a candle. Or she could go home.", "NTA", "NTA!", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t \u201chome\u201d. She was an extended guest/leech. If she doesn\u2019t like the smell, she can go. If she wants a say, she can get on the lease and pay. If he wants her to have a say, he can get her on the lease and pay her portion or split that. You should be able to cook in your own place! Couple of entitled weirdos. Having a breakdown over some curry.", "NTA. No rent no opinion. Check the lease because most have conditions that state no person shall stay past so many days without being on the lease. Can therefore bring this to the landlord and get her kicked out.", "NTA.\n\nEven if she did pay rent, you\u2019re right to tell them to piss off. You pay rent, which gives you the right to access and use the kitchen. \n\nSometimes roommates are just not compatible. If your roommate can\u2019t agree to a reasonable compromise, like a schedule or something, I say find a new roommate.", "NTA. This is not Sarah's apartment.", "ESH.\n\nYou're mocking Sarah for what could be a very valid condition. Many \"picky\" eaters are overly sensitive to certain odors or flavors. It's not just a dislike for certain foods. She may be having a physical reaction to what you're cooking. Your name calling and disdain for her make it pretty clear that you're being an AH on purpose.\n\nWhere she and Matt became AHs is when they tried to insist that you reduce your AH behavior but won't consider paying more than 50% of the rent, even though a 60/40 split would be more fair.\n\nThat said, you are a bigger AH than Sarah and Matt combined.", "NTA but maybe you should leave your GF, you don't speak very kindly of her so perhaps she feels the same?\n\nY'all probably better going seperate ways - I cook a lot too and could not love with someone that sensitive.", "did you get a choice when she \"moved in\" or was it like I guess she's just staying here from now on without a word? \n\nEither way I would tell them I'm going to continue to cook my own food and if you have a problem with that I'll bring it up the landlord that you (roomie) brought you're girlfriend in to live with us and doesn't pay rent and seriously if the cooking bothers her she can leave go to another room light a candle, burn some incense. \n\n I'm a picky eater and I love the smell of different types of cooking styles for example I love the smell of mushrooms garlic and onion being sauteed but could never eat it because ew mushrooms.\n\nIt sounds like he moved her in and they are trying to force you out before your agreement is done so they can have the place to themselves\n\nNTA", "I'd double down on the petty and just cook the trigger foods every damn day until she pays rent or leaves for good. What an insufferable couple to have to live with. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nAnd I\u2019d just like to point out that when she is at your apartment, she is abso \u201cnot home\u201d.", "OP is already cooking foods when Sarah is not home. Newsflash Sarah: this apartment/house is not your home. Quit trying to control what a leaseholder does in their own home.", "He should tell his roommate *\"I pay rent too and I don't like vagrants being invited to live here without consulting me!\"* lol", "Same. I rarely leave the house without Zofran. I don't expect everyone to accommodate me though. Certainly wouldn't expect someone to give up cooking in their own apartment when I am a guest. Whole new level of entitlement.", "Only\n\n>corndogs or chicken tenders", "This is the best solution. Sarah should take over your lease and you should move in with people who aren\u2019t crazy.", "...Time for them to move out.", "Maybe offer some leftover curry to Sarah's mom", "Same. The smell of onions in any form make me nauseous and give me headaches. Back when I lived with roommates,  I would go in my room and close the door if they were cooking involving onions. At the MOST, I would ask if they could open the windows and turn on a fan. ASK. And I paid rent.", "I hate fish so much. My roommate knew it and planned it around when I wasn\u2019t home as a courtesy. But I never said he couldn\u2019t. \n\nBut I also worked a lot of evenings so he could still make it a fair amount when he wanted too. A good balance.", "Fish for curry shouldn\u2019t stink.\n\nPickled herring on the other hand", "Happy cake day! \ud83c\udf82", "Why is OP the bigger A H? He legit pays rent and that\u2019s his own space. Sarah doesn\u2019t pay a dime and Matt enables this sort of behavior. Is this Matt or Sarah?", "Yeah no, she is a free loader in his apartment that he pays rent for. Crazy idea but she could just not come to the apartment when he\u2019s cooking  since ya know, she doesn\u2019t live there", "Dude is allowed to cook food that *he* likes to eat in *his own home.* Sarah, legitimate condition or not, is being crazy unreasonable and an entitled, whiny baby.\n\nHer condition--if she has one--is *her* responsibility to manage, not OP's. And the onus is on *her* to leave the room/apartment/whatever or get some medication or therapy to help her condition, and *not* on OP!", "What a brain dead comment", "It's the roommate's girlfriend, who also isn't paying any rent. I'm still scrolling to see if OP answered whether or not he was even consulted about her moving in, or if she was ever put on the lease.", "Read again bozo", "The good thing is this disagreement (which OP is 100% NTA) has led to them running out of the apartment for the time being. Which makes it a perfect opportunity to tell the landlord that OP\u2019s roommate is (most likely) violating his lease by having a guest stay for as long as Sarah has.", "I appreciate you"]}
