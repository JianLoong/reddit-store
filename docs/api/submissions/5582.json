I know alcoholics who can't even be anywhere near alcohol without caving to temptation. I'd wager if you can do all that without succumbing to temptation you're in a good place, and your family has nothing to worry about. Stay strong my dude.", "NAH.\nYou did something nice for your BIL.\nYour family is worried about your sobriety.\nBoth can be true, and nobody really be an AH.\n\nSome people will say you have no business ever going in a liquor store again, and they wouldn't be wrong, but you went for a singular purpose and didn't mess around. As long as you were in and out, and it didn't linger on your mind, I would say you are fine. But you don't want to make a habit of this...\n\nAnd yes, your family felt awkward. They know you don't drink anymore, and they know why you don't drink. They would be perfectly happy if you never went to a liquor store ever again. Trust is hard to build back once it's been damaged...\n\nI used to buy the wine for holiday dinners even after I quit drinking (4/12/2000) because I was the only one who knew anything about decent wine...but I eventually quit because it wasn't worth it.\n\nNext year, get him something else. Anything else... it's just easier for everyone.", "NAH - it sounds like you're able to handle entering the liquor store and being around it well, and that's great. \n\nBut as a child of an alcoholic, I can see their point of view. It could easily be a trigger for relapse. And while I don't know your history, it's very likely that your family has trauma from your alcoholism. It's understandable that they got upset and wanted to make sure you were okay.", "NaH. I think that it's good that your family is checking in with you. Recovery is a long term thing, and I understand their concern. I think it would have been worse if they hadn't checked in tbh. Maybe they weren't exactly tactful. And I don't think you're an ass either for knowing your limits and boundaries and going to get a gift you knew you were capable of getting.", "NTA if you were my brother I might have checked in with you, in private, or quietly told you I was proud of where you had gotten too, again in private. A certainly wouldn't have, over the gift exchange, implanted the idea that you were relapsing over a thoughtful gift.\n\nAnd you know what, since apparently your family won't say it I will- good work. Dealing with addiction is hard but you seem to have a good understanding of your own boundaries and comfort and that is impressive.", "NAH. I've been sober for ten years, and for about the first year, I would not have been able to go into a liquor store. You can't avoid triggers, though, you have to learn how to deal with them. Where I live, you literally can't buy a loaf of bread without passing a wine display. What am I gonna do, never go to the grocery store ever again? \n\nNowdays, I kinda like giving people a bottle of something they can enjoy even if I can't. It's like giving a younger person an awesome jacket that you wore back in the day and enjoying how much of a kick they get out of it. \n\nI have found, though, that people without alcoholism have trouble calibrating alcoholics' responses to alcohol. They don't have a good handle on what's worrisome and what's not. (EDIT: And, to be fair, sometimes people with alcoholism don't have a good handle on what's worrisome and what's not, so I do see where your family is coming from.)", "NTA.   You didn't buy it for yourself, you bought it as a gift.", "NtA. If they can't believe you went in and didn't biy anything for yourself that says more about them than it does you. \n\nI'm proud of you for walking into a liquor store and only getting something for your BIL! Hope you guys manage to have a wonderful Christmas", "NAH You did something nice for a family member. Your family wants to make sure you're still doing okay. In the future, I would maybe not give alcohol as a gift just to avoid any unnecessary concern or misunderstandings.", "NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t trust you. Neither does anyone else that expressed disbelief. I advise next time presenting the doubters with a receipt.", "I think you are NTA, but I recommend calling your sponsor and asking them what they think.", "NAH it\u2019s fair for them to be concerned. Congrats on being so solid in your sobriety", "Honestly, is there even really a conflict to judge here?\n\nI see a recovering alcoholic gifting a family member alcohol, and a family checking to see if everything is okay, followed by a reassurance that there has been no relapse.", "NAH.  You were thinking of nothing except getting a nice gift for your BIL.  But the concerns of your family is very understandable.  They are worried that in addition to the bottle you got for your BIL, you got another bottle to hide in the garage.", "NTA They do not know your journey, your recovery or even your triggers. I have known revovering alcoholics that are perfectly okay keeping wine in their home or even whiskey. It doesn't affect their sobriety at all and they don't feel threatened or nervous when it's there. In tv history, you had a bar owner who was a recovering alcoholic (Sam from the show Cheers) if they can put it on television in the 80s, even as a pretend place, it is NOT that far divorced from reality. They need to LEAVE YOUR RECOVERY TO YOU. Just let them know,  \"my recovery is not in jeopardy, please either educate yourself about the many different issues and layers of addiction recovery, or else stay out of MY business, thankyouverymuch and good day. I said GOOD DAY!\" Then turn on your heel and walk away. It is none of their business and they are in no position to make that call for you.", "NTA. You bought someone a gift they're the ones assuming a former alcoholic isn't able to even see alcohol without drinking again. That's ridiculous and many past alcoholics still consume alcohol and are able to self regulate. Not saying you should go do it of course. If anything they're the ones who ruined the gift exchange by making a gift awkward and seemingly not believing you. You should be so proud of yourself for being able to not even think about wanting to drink while buying whiskey. That's awesome! Go you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Booze is a good gift and an easy gift.", "NTA.\n\nI don't think you family understands how alcoholism works.", " NTA", "Nta if *he* was the recovering alcoholic, sure.

You\u2019re NTA, you clearly meant well and are holding true to your sobriety.", "If you are comfortable giving it, they have nothing to say. They can have their concerns of course, but making a big deal about it is the wrong way to go. \nNTA. You thoughtfully gave your BIL something you knew he would like. Good for you.\n\nMerry Christmas!", "I'm loathe to call his family assholes for reaching out concerned about his sobriety. \n\nIt's great that OP is still sober, but a close family member's alcoholism can leave some really deep scars. So long as they weren't actually harassing him, I don't see the harm here.\n\nIf anything, OP's insistence that they were being 'ridiculous' may feel to them like a case of 'doth protest too much'. \n\nAdmittedly, the OP is pretty barebones, and they potentially just wouldn't let up, in which case, that's fair - I just don't see any indication of that.", "That proves nothing, just that on that transaction OP only purchased the bottle for BIL. Not that they didn't buy some for them before or after (at least to people who want to think ill of OP). \n\n\nI don't love people from the USA obsession with utter abstinence and painting any minor interaction with alcohol  that is not drinking with intent  (like buying a specific bottle for someone) as basically the same as drinking with intent.", "Don't assume he's sober because of any particular program or that he has any kind of sponsor.\n\nAlso, complete abstinence isn't always the only way to do it for everyone. Yes, it's the best way for most people. But there's exceptions. For example, Some people only drink excessively in particular situations, and only need to avoid being in those situations.", "Dont assume he's not. Sober describes one who was in a state of acute life destroying alcoholism, but is currently in remission. Like cancer, it can come back even stronger. Most people who successfully achieve and maintain sobriety do so through a twelve step program. \n\nAlso, do you know what they call alcoholics who dont practice abstinence? Alcoholics. Drunks. Sometimes convicts. And occasionally dead. Booze kills. Some faster than others. Alcoholics cant drink normally. Ever. Their brains and body chemistry wont let them. They can live mostly normal lives while their disease remains under control. OP deserves a medal for getting sober. Checking in with his sponsor in this circumstance is a way to help him stay that way."]}
