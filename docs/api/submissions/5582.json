As long as you were in and out, and it didn't linger on your mind, I would say you are fine. But you don't want to make a habit of this...\n\nAnd yes, your family felt awkward. They know you don't drink anymore, and they know why you don't drink. They would be perfectly happy if you never went to a liquor store ever again.

Anything else... it's just easier for everyone.", "NAH - it sounds like you're able to handle entering the liquor store and being around it well, and that's great. \n\nBut as a child of an alcoholic, I can see their point of view. It could easily be a trigger for relapse. And while I don't know your history, it's very likely that your family has trauma from your alcoholism. It's understandable that they got upset and wanted to make sure you were okay.", "NaH. I think that it's good that your family is checking in with you. Recovery is a long term thing, and I understand their concern. I think it would have been worse if they hadn't checked in tbh. Maybe they weren't exactly tactful. And I don't think you're an ass either for knowing your limits and boundaries and going to get a gift you knew you were capable of getting.", "NTA if you were my brother I might have checked in with you, in private, or quietly told you I was proud of where you had gotten too, again in private. A certainly wouldn't have, over the gift exchange, implanted the idea that you were relapsing over a thoughtful gift.\n\nAnd you know what, since apparently your family won't say it I will- good work.

I've been sober for ten years, and for about the first year, I would not have been able to go into a liquor store. You can't avoid triggers, though, you have to learn how to deal with them. Where I live, you literally can't buy a loaf of bread without passing a wine display. What am I gonna do, never go to the grocery store ever again? \n\nNowdays, I kinda like giving people a bottle of something they can enjoy even if I can't. It's like giving a younger person an awesome jacket that you wore back in the day and enjoying how much of a kick they get out of it. \n\nI have found, though, that people without alcoholism have trouble calibrating alcoholics' responses to alcohol. They don't have a good handle on what's worrisome and what's not.

I have known revovering alcoholics that are perfectly okay keeping wine in their home or even whiskey. It doesn't affect their sobriety at all and they don't feel threatened or nervous when it's there. In tv history, you had a bar owner who was a recovering alcoholic (Sam from the show Cheers) if they can put it on television in the 80s, even as a pretend place, it is NOT that far divorced from reality. They need to LEAVE YOUR RECOVERY TO YOU. Just let them know,  \"my recovery is not in jeopardy, please either educate yourself about the many different issues and layers of addiction recovery, or else stay out of MY business, thankyouverymuch and good day. I said GOOD DAY!\" Then turn on your heel and walk away. It is none of their business and they are in no position to make that call for you.", "NTA. You bought someone a gift they're the ones assuming a former alcoholic isn't able to even see alcohol without drinking again. That's ridiculous and many past alcoholics still consume alcohol and are able to self regulate. Not saying you should go do it of course.

Sometimes convicts. And occasionally dead. Booze kills. Some faster than others. Alcoholics cant drink normally. Ever. Their brains and body chemistry wont let them.

That's perfectly normal family gift exchange behavior?  Then she checked in in private.", "Agreed.  NAH.\n\nEspecially since many alcoholics can do serious damage before realizing they need to get sober, so it can be triggering for their loved ones to see them even handling alcohol. \n\nThree years sober is a great feat but also  certainly within bounds to still be at risk of a relapse. \n\nOne check in to make sure op is okay, and perhaps a bit of extra keeping an eye out for red flags, is warranted when recovering from addiction.", "She asked if the gift was really from him- what answer did she really expect?

Been sober 14 years and I still feel like the sober police are gonna get me whenever I go to a state store but I occasionally gift people alcohol that they like.  My husband is not alcoholic so he usually just takes care of that for me but I\u2019ve done it on my own a few times too.  I have no desire to drink it so it\u2019s just not a big deal.  When I was earlier in sobriety my family was very worried about drinking in front of me and my parents offered to get rid of their whole wet bar (like $1000 at least of high end liquor) but I told them not to. They love you and want to support you but they probably just don\u2019t know how.

And over the last week or so she\u2019s opened and drank every single one, and was bewildered as to why I was upset that the only thing she\u2019d gotten me for Christmas was alcohol.\n\nThe difference between our situations is, you bought alcohol for someone else as a recovered alcoholic, with no intention to drink it. My mum bought alcohol for someone else as an active alcoholic, and drank the entire lot. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t even call you TA if you were to have a glass of it if Ryan offered. I would call you TA if you bought it \u201cfor Ryan\u201d and then drank the lot. \n\nI can understand your family\u2019s concern with alcohol, but to me it doesn\u2019t seem as if there\u2019s any cause for worry.

I know a lot of people might only have experience with recovery from the presentation in popular media)", "NAH. \n\nThey were concerned because that temptation can be enough for people to relapse.

They have no way of knowing for certain that he didn't buy himself anything, that this isn't a sign he's spiraling etc. All they have is OP's word, which isn't really worth much when it comes to alcohol. How many times do you think OP told him he was \"fine\" while he was alcoholic?\n\nNo one is an AH in this situation, especially since we don't know what OP was like as an alcoholic. His family is justifiably concerned, and seem to expressing that concern with love and not criticism. OP was merely trying not to let his alcohol struggles prevent others from living their best life, which is commendable. \n\nThis is a rather healthy family, at least for this subreddit lol.", "But you can buy alcohol literally anywhere else", "Alright, I'll try again. I mention it in order to add perspective. There's not just one way to have moved past alcoholism. It's not directed at OP. They are separate people. \n\nYou strike me as one of those \"walk on egg shells\"-people, who are afraid that something you say could potentially cause the \"house of cards\" that is someone's sobriety to come crashing down. OP is comfortable enough to walk into a store and pick out a bottle of whiskey, have it around for a couple of days, and give it away without further thought. That, to me, sounds more stable than what an anecdote from a stranger on the internet could hope to ruin. \n\nAlso, a gentle \"fuck you\" to you, on behalf of my friend, for you making use of language like \"for now\". I'm sure you didn't necessarily mean it like that, but allow me to point out how condescending it is to use language that all but states that he'll fall off the wagon.", "Exactly this! We don\u2019t know what OP and his family have gone through apart and together about OP\u2019s alcoholism. His family being concerned sounds like it comes from a place of love, not judgement.\n\nTbh this would also make me nervous/weirdly guilty to receive alcohol from a recovering alcoholic.", "> The axe forgets, but the tree remembers\n\nAlways love this saying.", "You don\u2019t think an alcoholic buying alcohol could ever possibly be a sign of relapse? Like you don\u2019t get their concern whatsoever?\n\nPeople are acting like they are starting screaming and threw him out. The fact they felt comfortable enough to talk to OP is a good sign.", "Just because it may be safe for you to go into a liquor store and you \"never touch\" his alcohol doesn't mean other alcoholics are the same.", "Yes you can, but there's a difference between knowing it's out there, and actively browsing the aisles", "I think they\u2019re assholes for immediately jumping to \u201cdid you get something for yourself\u201d. If they started off concerned that it might have tempted OP I\u2019d understand that or asking if OP is okay, but they lead with straight up accusations, and at Christmas too.", "I am also a recovering alcoholic and will say buying alcohol as a gift does not necessarily means he wants to start drinking again.  He just wants to try to be normal and if his BIL likes whiskey he wants to do the normal thing and gift it to him.  My wife does not drink much but I make sure she knows it does not bother me.  Hell I encourage it because if I can't drink, at least one of us can have a good time LOL.  I am only half kidding because I have learned to have a good time without alcohol.  Took me awhile though.", "I am also a recovering alcoholic and if I can't go into a bar or into a liquor store without relapsing then I am not truly committed to my recovery.  Going into a liquor store is no different than seeing a beer commercial to me.  And I see beer commercials all the time as I am a huge college football fan.", "\"Although\u00a0AA is a spirituality-based program\"\n\nWhen one of the steps literally requires you to make peace with a higher power and describes itself as \"open and understanding to agnostic and atheists\" it borders on the religious. Something doesnt have to be pointed at one religion to be religion based. \n\nThere are tons of recovery programs that are not like that that DONT use sponsors."]}
