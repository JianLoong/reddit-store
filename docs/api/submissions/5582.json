I know alcoholics who can't even be anywhere near alcohol without caving to temptation. I'd wager if you can do all that without succumbing to temptation you're in a good place, and your family has nothing to worry about. Stay strong my dude.", "NAH.\nYou did something nice for your BIL.\nYour family is worried about your sobriety.\nBoth can be true, and nobody really be an AH.\n\nSome people will say you have no business ever going in a liquor store again, and they wouldn't be wrong, but you went for a singular purpose and didn't mess around. As long as you were in and out, and it didn't linger on your mind, I would say you are fine. But you don't want to make a habit of this...\n\nAnd yes, your family felt awkward. They know you don't drink anymore, and they know why you don't drink. They would be perfectly happy if you never went to a liquor store ever again. Trust is hard to build back once it's been damaged...\n\nI used to buy the wine for holiday dinners even after I quit drinking (4/12/2000) because I was the only one who knew anything about decent wine...but I eventually quit because it wasn't worth it.\n\nNext year, get him something else. Anything else... it's just easier for everyone.", "NAH - it sounds like you're able to handle entering the liquor store and being around it well, and that's great. \n\nBut as a child of an alcoholic, I can see their point of view. It could easily be a trigger for relapse. And while I don't know your history, it's very likely that your family has trauma from your alcoholism. It's understandable that they got upset and wanted to make sure you were okay.", "NaH. I think that it's good that your family is checking in with you. Recovery is a long term thing, and I understand their concern. I think it would have been worse if they hadn't checked in tbh. Maybe they weren't exactly tactful. And I don't think you're an ass either for knowing your limits and boundaries and going to get a gift you knew you were capable of getting.", "NTA if you were my brother I might have checked in with you, in private, or quietly told you I was proud of where you had gotten too, again in private. A certainly wouldn't have, over the gift exchange, implanted the idea that you were relapsing over a thoughtful gift.\n\nAnd you know what, since apparently your family won't say it I will- good work. Dealing with addiction is hard but you seem to have a good understanding of your own boundaries and comfort and that is impressive.", "NAH. I've been sober for ten years, and for about the first year, I would not have been able to go into a liquor store. You can't avoid triggers, though, you have to learn how to deal with them. Where I live, you literally can't buy a loaf of bread without passing a wine display. What am I gonna do, never go to the grocery store ever again? \n\nNowdays, I kinda like giving people a bottle of something they can enjoy even if I can't. It's like giving a younger person an awesome jacket that you wore back in the day and enjoying how much of a kick they get out of it. \n\nI have found, though, that people without alcoholism have trouble calibrating alcoholics' responses to alcohol. They don't have a good handle on what's worrisome and what's not. (EDIT: And, to be fair, sometimes people with alcoholism don't have a good handle on what's worrisome and what's not, so I do see where your family is coming from.)", "NTA.

Hope you guys manage to have a wonderful Christmas", "NAH You did something nice for a family member. Your family wants to make sure you're still doing okay. In the future, I would maybe not give alcohol as a gift just to avoid any unnecessary concern or misunderstandings.", "NTA. Your sister doesn\u2019t trust you.

Congrats on being so solid in your sobriety", "Honestly, is there even really a conflict to judge here?\n\nI see a recovering alcoholic gifting a family member alcohol, and a family checking to see if everything is okay, followed by a reassurance that there has been no relapse.", "NAH.  You were thinking of nothing except getting a nice gift for your BIL.  But the concerns of your family is very understandable.  They are worried that in addition to the bottle you got for your BIL, you got another bottle to hide in the garage.", "NTA They do not know your journey, your recovery or even your triggers. I have known revovering alcoholics that are perfectly okay keeping wine in their home or even whiskey. It doesn't affect their sobriety at all and they don't feel threatened or nervous when it's there. In tv history, you had a bar owner who was a recovering alcoholic (Sam from the show Cheers) if they can put it on television in the 80s, even as a pretend place, it is NOT that far divorced from reality. They need to LEAVE YOUR RECOVERY TO YOU. Just let them know,  \"my recovery is not in jeopardy, please either educate yourself about the many different issues and layers of addiction recovery, or else stay out of MY business, thankyouverymuch and good day. I said GOOD DAY!\" Then turn on your heel and walk away. It is none of their business and they are in no position to make that call for you.", "NTA. You bought someone a gift they're the ones assuming a former alcoholic isn't able to even see alcohol without drinking again. That's ridiculous and many past alcoholics still consume alcohol and are able to self regulate. Not saying you should go do it of course. If anything they're the ones who ruined the gift exchange by making a gift awkward and seemingly not believing you. You should be so proud of yourself for being able to not even think about wanting to drink while buying whiskey. That's awesome! Go you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Good for you.\n\nMerry Christmas!", "I'm loathe to call his family assholes for reaching out concerned about his sobriety. \n\nIt's great that OP is still sober, but a close family member's alcoholism can leave some really deep scars. So long as they weren't actually harassing him, I don't see the harm here.\n\nIf anything, OP's insistence that they were being 'ridiculous' may feel to them like a case of 'doth protest too much'. \n\nAdmittedly, the OP is pretty barebones, and they potentially just wouldn't let up, in which case, that's fair - I just don't see any indication of that.", "That proves nothing, just that on that transaction OP only purchased the bottle for BIL. Not that they didn't buy some for them before or after (at least to people who want to think ill of OP). \n\n\nI don't love people from the USA obsession with utter abstinence and painting any minor interaction with alcohol  that is not drinking with intent  (like buying a specific bottle for someone) as basically the same as drinking with intent.", "Don't assume he's sober because of any particular program or that he has any kind of sponsor.\n\nAlso, complete abstinence isn't always the only way to do it for everyone. Yes, it's the best way for most people. But there's exceptions. For example, Some people only drink excessively in particular situations, and only need to avoid being in those situations.", "Dont assume he's not. Sober describes one who was in a state of acute life destroying alcoholism, but is currently in remission. Like cancer, it can come back even stronger. Most people who successfully achieve and maintain sobriety do so through a twelve step program. \n\nAlso, do you know what they call alcoholics who dont practice abstinence? Alcoholics. Drunks. Sometimes convicts. And occasionally dead. Booze kills. Some faster than others. Alcoholics cant drink normally. Ever. Their brains and body chemistry wont let them. They can live mostly normal lives while their disease remains under control. OP deserves a medal for getting sober. Checking in with his sponsor in this circumstance is a way to help him stay that way.", "I have an anaphylactic allergy to strawberries but I still buy stawberry items for other people\u2026 gifts are about the happiness of the recipient, not the giver. \n\nNTA, sorry your family is second guessing your sobriety.", "You got something knew your brother would enjoy. Props to you for being able to do it and stay sober!!!!!", "NAH it was a nice gift and it's natural your family would be concerned for you under the circumstances. Recovery is a long, hard road and different things can be triggers for people", "They may simply be worried. \n\nOP your alcoholism affects them as well. You loose their trust in the process and yes you need to earn that back! Knowing that you have been to that store might make  them afraid that you were triggered and and bought also for yourself without telling them.\n\nEspecially if you have a history of drinking in secret. Next time maybe tell someone in advance and ask them to go with you to the store. \n\nAlso time will be on your side here. If you have been like more years sober then you may have earned back their trust. And then you can go alone.\n\nYou are not the AH for buying the gift. Neither are they for being worried.\n\nNAH", "INFO: Did your addiction negatively impact them? Before you got sober, did you disrupt family functions, especially holidays, while drunk?", "INFO if they've spent any time getting you out of a jam before you got sober it's not out of line for them to have worried about you going into a liquor store for whatever reason.  It's quite possible that they've suffered from your actions and you haven't fully regained their trust, and this may be totally reasonable.  Did your actions before you got sober only affect yourself and not involve your family?", "Light YTA. Congratulations on your sobriety! If it is anything like my experiences they don't want to think about you and alcohol in the same room period. And you normalizing alcohol in any way is probably scaring the shit out of them.", "Er she just asked if the gift was from him and said \"oh\"?  That's perfectly normal family gift exchange behavior?  Then she checked in in private.", "Agreed.  NAH.\n\nEspecially since many alcoholics can do serious damage before realizing they need to get sober, so it can be triggering for their loved ones to see them even handling alcohol. \n\nThree years sober is a great feat but also  certainly within bounds to still be at risk of a relapse. \n\nOne check in to make sure op is okay, and perhaps a bit of extra keeping an eye out for red flags, is warranted when recovering from addiction.", "She asked if the gift was really from him- what answer did she really expect? The answer to that question would have been yes even of he had asked a friend to pick it up for him. It was a loaded question that cast unfair suspicion onto OP.", "Not everyone goes to AA/NA or has a sponsor for their sobriety. Some aren\u2019t comfortable with the setting there but still manages to maintain their sobriety without AA/NA with other methods. I do congratulate OP for staying sober though, regardless on whether or not he has a sponsor.", "All of this is true, but in EXTREME situations. And again, you are ASSUMING OP got clean using AA. Some people, like myself, got sober cold turkey (3 years last week) and have continued to do so without the help of a religious organization.", "Is AA a cult or something? Jeez.", "AA/NA tend to have a lot of religious connotations some people don't want. So it can be in some instances.", "NTA\n\nThere's no malice meant by this statement but it seems you family would do well to educate themselves. Of course they're worried about you, but three years sober should be enough that they don't immediately doubt that you've fallen off the wagon.\n\nI know a few recovering alcoholics and all of them have reached a point where they can comfortably be around alcohol. One of them has even come far enough that he drinks socially. Never more than one or two drinks, but he made it a goal that an illness he feels he has overcome, shouldn't be allowed to dictate his social interactions for the rest of his life. I want to stress that I know that this isn't and shouldn't be the goal for all recovering alcoholics, I just mention it for the perspective that people can put their disease so far behind them.", "NTA its great to overcome the shadows of your past and let others enjoy what you can't.\n\njust take care of yourself man!", "This sounds like great growth and whilst I might understand them asking they should ultimately be really proud of you for this. NTA at all.", "NTA just because they are uncomfortable and don't know how to act regarding you and alcohol. I mean are you allowed in restaurants with a liquor license? This def sound a like a them problem but you could graciously offer to educate them or direct them to therapy for their hangup\nCongrats on 3 yrs", "NAH, assuming it was one genuinely concerned comment not disbelieving interrogation", "I can definitely see how the family might read this as 'no don't worry, I just went to my dealer to pickup drugs from someone else, I'm totally fine.' I know that's not what happen but I can see how alarm bells would go off! Besides, it's better to have people worry about you in this case than not worry about you.", "Agree. Hard to judge with the info given--we don't know the depth of the addiction and possible effects on the family. The axe forgets, but the tree remembers. For now, NAH.", "Awesome! Congratulations! Xxx", "And again, you are ASSUMING op did not. AA isnt religious. Celebrate Recovery is. \n\nIn any case, congratulations on your sobriety.", "Nope. Go watch a few episodes of Mom. Thats how cult like it is. It helps thousands get free from addictions.", "Yes", "NTA - First off, congratulations on your sobriety! \nSecondly, my husband is 6 years sober and he will purchase alcohol for me on occasion when he does the grocery shopping. \n\nAs long as YOU were comfortable and not concerned about your sobriety then that is all that matters.", "NTA.  Been sober 14 years and I still feel like the sober police are gonna get me whenever I go to a state store but I occasionally gift people alcohol that they like.  My husband is not alcoholic so he usually just takes care of that for me but I\u2019ve done it on my own a few times too.  I have no desire to drink it so it\u2019s just not a big deal.  When I was earlier in sobriety my family was very worried about drinking in front of me and my parents offered to get rid of their whole wet bar (like $1000 at least of high end liquor) but I told them not to. They love you and want to support you but they probably just don\u2019t know how.  As long as you didn\u2019t feel triggered, obsessive or uncomfortable about it it\u2019s probably fine, but I wouldn\u2019t make a habit of it.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m going through a bit of a similar situation myself - my mum is an alcoholic (claims to be recovering and, not to slate her, but I see little to no evidence of that) and for Christmas she decided to buy me countless bottles of alcohol. Wine, vodka, cider, you name it. And over the last week or so she\u2019s opened and drank every single one, and was bewildered as to why I was upset that the only thing she\u2019d gotten me for Christmas was alcohol.\n\nThe difference between our situations is, you bought alcohol for someone else as a recovered alcoholic, with no intention to drink it. My mum bought alcohol for someone else as an active alcoholic, and drank the entire lot. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t even call you TA if you were to have a glass of it if Ryan offered. I would call you TA if you bought it \u201cfor Ryan\u201d and then drank the lot. \n\nI can understand your family\u2019s concern with alcohol, but to me it doesn\u2019t seem as if there\u2019s any cause for worry. Enjoy your Christmas!", "If he\u2019s not showing any signs of relapsing then I think they\u2019re absolutely assholes. He didn\u2019t just randomly give someone the whiskey he gave someone he knows really enjoys it. None of that is out of the ordinary."]}
