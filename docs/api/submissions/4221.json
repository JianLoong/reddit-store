We have always been doing shoots together indoors and outdoors. \n\nRecently, he had a project for his film school, asked if I could shoot for him and kept insisting, which I didn\u2019t care as I\u2019ve always been the only person who is in his short films or shoots.\n\nI told him I\u2019ll do this and he wanted it to be fifteen minutes long. After we were done with the scenes he wanted outside, our parents were on a work stay, so we had the free house to do the shooting and no interruptions inside.\n\nIt was a scene where it was the early morning and I wake up, make a coffee, sit on my balcony and smoke. The weather was beautiful and I understood the ambience he was trying to exude. \n\nUntil before the scene, he wanted a sense of \u201cauthenticity, realism and intimacy in the scene\u201d, I asked him \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d and he said \u201cI sleep naked and it feels like a love letter to life\u201d. I proceeded to say \u201cyou want me to be naked in the short film? That you will show your fellow classmates?\u201d.

Most of all, just thinking about my brother having a file like that sends bile up my throat. \n\nI go back to him, ask him to give me the file so I can delete it permanently and that i wanted to redact the start where I was naked. He told me that he already \u201csubmitted it\u201d and it would be pointless if I deleted it. I felt embarrassed and sickened. I still feel greatly upset with him and haven\u2019t spoken to him. I informed him beforehand that i will not shoot for him again. He got upset and angry, told me that I was his \u201cmuse\u201d and got him into his desired film school.

Your brother is what's wrong with the industry.  \"A love letter to life\" plus \"authenticity, realism and intimacy\" involves filming one's topless 18 year old sister (!) and then submitting it -- one hopes to the professor and not to his fellow-students, because if a room full of undergraduate film students have access to it , it could find its way onto the internet for all eternity?  \n\nAnd then he refuses to try to kill it (assuming he really has submitted it already; You'd think he would have had to spend some time editing it and maybe color correcting it, so it's very possible he's just plain lying.)\n\nNo, your brother's behavior would be what we call \"exploitation,\" not a handful of pseudo-Truffaut cliches.\n\nLet him know that you never agreed for him to put a film featuring your naked body into the computers of a bunch of film students, that this makes you extremely vulnerable, and that in the absence of consent, he is very likely violating rules his film school has about the making of shorts.   \n\nIf your brother is at a legitimate film school, and if the film has genuinely already been submitted, you may be able to contact his production professor, his advisor, or the dean of his branch of the film school to withdraw the film from being shown or stored anywhere that others could access it.  \n\nI also think it might make sense to talk with your parents and get them to pressure your brother to take care of this.\n\nAnd if he still plans to go public with your film, may I suggest you threaten to go public with him.  I doubt that a whole lot of female students in his program are going to be dying to work with a guy who would do this to you.  I doubt that female professors are going to be thrilled with him either. Film school students have all kinds of internet presence. So do cinematography websites.  There are chats galore.  There are all kinds of places you could post.

Jaime Lannister is a famous Game of Thrones character, who was having an incestuous affair with his sister (Cersei). They're 'joking' that your brother is sexually attracted to you. \n\nBut they're not 'joking', are they? If this isn't actually a troll post, your brother's behaviour IS suspicious. Most brothers WOULDN'T dream of asking their sister to do that - even for 'art'. They especially wouldn't refuse to delete it, when their sister was uncomfortable. This whole story about him having 'submitted it' is as dodgy as hell. \n\nSo are you SURE your brother doesn't have any sexual attraction to you? The 'art' claim seems like a dodgy excuse - for whatever he REALLY wants you half-naked on film for. I wonder if he's even looking to upload the footage (possibly for profit) on dodgy websites. \n\n'The things I do for love' is one of Jaime's quotes. He says it after he tries to murder a child, to hide his affair with Cersei.", "I'm not artsy at all and have never done editing apart from about 5 minutes on Instagram photos but... seems a little odd that he got everything he needed in one 15 minute go and did all of the editing in one morning and \"submitted\" it? I understand 15 minutes is short but that that's still 15 whole minutes of product to cut, edit, and rewatch. Even just rewatching the final product a few times would take a couple of hours. And where did he \"submit\" it? For school? Was it due this morning?", "Also work in film, no way anything is edited and submitted in a couple hours. \n\nSomeone else mentioned the 18 thing and how recently she turned. \n\nStinks of \u201csweet I can finally film my sister naked and not be hit for kid porn\u201d vibes.", "Also wondering this, and she hasn\u2019t posted on a single one of these comments, which lends me to agree with the people saying something is fishy about the post in general", "No, NTA. He's the AH for lying. Because there is no way he sent it in. That's not how editing and producing work.  Fuck, I mean the rendering alone would take a nap,  even with zero editing.", "> it\u2019s not weird as I am your brother. \n\nIt is weirder x1000000 that the brother is the one asking to film them topless", "I'd be willing to bet that unless he had her sign a consent form, she can 1000% claim (accurately) that she was coerced into shooting nude (early morning, she said no, he wouldn't accept it, he's her older brother and she trusted him, etc). His professors will not be impressed with this situation \\*at all\\*\n\nWhat brother wants a sense of \"authenticity, realism, and intimacy\" that involves his sister's breasts, then throws a fit when she has regrets?", "I have a bad feeling he pretends his \u201cmuse\u201d is actually a gf. No was in hell his teachers, classmates, and friends wouldn\u2019t bully him into oblivion if they knew the truth.", "It's not always revokable. Especially if you sign a model release, which would normally be pretty standard in this scenario, but was likely overlooked due to the model being the photog's sibling. So maybe in this one specific scenario it is, but typically, once you sign that release and pose, that's all she wrote. It's out and there's nothing you can do to stop it.", "I\u2019m with you. I hate having to delete any projects like that. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m expecting to need them, it\u2019s just so much time and effort went into them that I have issues binning them.", "Kinda just sounds like someone who is way too trusting. I know several adults who grew up with parents who basically enforced trust in their household when it was not deserved and these people are now effed up by it.", "Agreed. I can see having my focus elsewhere after this, but to consistently avoid the questions that, if answered, would possibly solve the issue entirely - sus.", "Was thinking of this. High quality files can take hours to render.", "If OP had said something to the effect of \"it is normal for my family to see each other in states of undress\" or \" we are a body positive family, so walking around topless is normal\" and the brother would be slightly less creepy. As the post stands, brother is creepy and wanted boobs for nefarious reasons.", "Exactly.", "Can confirm from being in a similar situation", "I was thinking more about this than I SHOULD lol.  \n\n\nSeveral things.  \n\n\n1) So weird to only do ONE TAKE for a school project.  Nothing in me believes he could take a film in one take and think to do well.  Do they normally do One Take?  Did she not ask herself this?  \n\n\n2)  The editing.  It takes awhile to edit -- color correct/grade, clip out unwanted things, trim to time, to tell the story, to keep shot framing consistent.  Has she never taken an interest in the editing part  before?  Does she not know how long its taken him in the past?  \n\n\n3) she hasn't responded to multiple recourses.  I understand this was posted 10 hours ago and she could still just be sleeping, but, yes, this seems more and more just like... what.", "NTA buuuuuut, I might be wrong, you were fine with it until you thought about it more. My meaning is you probably let the views of others change the way you yourself thought about it beforehand. There's a reddit called howtonotgiveafuck you may want to check out. When I was like 19 and the internet was pretty new I learned I could make my own web page on a LiveJournal type website and had recently had my penis pierced. I wanted to show off a bit and I posted images of my new jewelry. I was proud but an aunt saw my page and told me its disgusting that I'd put my junk for everyone to see. I immediately took those down and felt bad for my aunt having seen. Now in my 40s I'm much more \"its a human body\" why would we find disgust in our bodies? I still love my aunt but she is from a different time and thinks different. Its not her fault and I dont have to feel shame for her views", "I'll take things that never happened for 15 thanks Alex.", "YTA for the incest fan fiction", "ESH\n\nYou gave him permission to shoot. He did. You changed your mind. Get working on that time machine or deal with the fact that you did something that you now feel weird about. As someone who has been nude for photographers and in independent college film work it can seem weird but in any kind of art department it\u2019s not weird at all. \n\nHe\u2019s a bit weird as if I needed my sibling to be naked for me for an art project it would definitely be one of the first things out of my mouth about the project. Bringing it up midway through might indicate an after thought or that he did t know if you\u2019d go through with it. It\u2019s a bit weird for him to describe you as his muse. \n\nAnd for people who don\u2019t think he could have already turned it in, welcome to art school. I did work on projects with friends in the middle of the night so it could be cut in real quick and submitted within hours of being shot. Not saying he has submitted it but don\u2019t act like there\u2019s no way a college kid would ever do something last minute or that film video editing stuff can\u2019t be done last minute.", "\"Got it on first try\" was the first red flag for me", "Threaten to reach out to his school and the film department and then follow through on it if he doesn't give up the file. Consent is king. Just because it was given once doesn't mean it can't be revoked. And once consent has been revoked the situation should be treated as though consent was never given in the first place.\n\nPersonally, it sounds like this guy is fond of a certain subgenre of porn and is pushing boundaries to fulfill a fantasy of his. Who knows how far he will push those boundaries though. This needs to be nipped in the bud right now. NTA OP. Your brother is one though and he's a creep.", "NTA- he's selling nudes of his own fucking sister to people for his own profit, mark my words.", "Why isn\u2019t this higher?", "It\u2019s not a matter of disgust.  It\u2019s a matter of boundaries and privacy.  Nowhere did she give any indication that her opinion was influenced by anyone else.  She realized she is uncomfortable with randos seeing her naked and changed her mind.  It doesn\u2019t matter if she loves her body or hates it; if she doesn\u2019t want people to see it, that is 100% her prerogative.", "Yeah. I feel like he would need a written release from you in order to use this content in an assignment anyway in all likelihood, so if he didn\u2019t get one and he\u2019s claiming he\u2019s submitted the assignment already, I suspect he\u2019s lying and this may not even be for an assignment", "I\u2019m skeptical there even is a project. The entire thing is so creepy and manipulative.", "What if it\u2019s not for his personal use but for him to sell/ share to others? I know when I was in college there was a frat that would stockpile and share nude photos and videos amongst each other. Uni wouldn\u2019t do shit about it.", "Yeah, just like how Francophiles literally cream themselves when they see the Eiffel Tower, or how neophiles pop one every time they encounter something new.\n\nThis post was already weird enough without whatever you\u2019re trying to do here lol. These are all established words without sexual connotations.", "Listen, my older brother molested me growing up. It absolutely is possible that your brother is thinking of you that way and while it isn\u2019t something people like to think about, you should definitely ask your parents to intervene here.", "I think you don\u2019t think that because your brother has desensitized you. As someone with an older brother, let me lay out the basic guidelines of a sibling relationship: \n- too much physical contact  (other than the occasional hug when saying hello or on holidays or celebrations) \n- seeing each other in states of undress is weird \n- being too interested in your siblings dating/sex life is weird \n- talking about/showing how attractive your sibling is to other people is weird \n- being overly possessive of your sibling is weird \n\nI know some siblings hug/cuddle in a non-incestuous way, but when it comes to brothers and sisters that tends to fade out a bit once you hit the teenage years. But I can tell you that a vast majority of brothers would rather die than see their sister topless, even if it was for a school project (at least my brother would lol)", "The term in *TGG* was \"old sport\" and had a very ery different meaning. \n\nYou said in another comment that you tend to be too trusting. This is one time when you MUST get past that tendency and stop your brother. Do NOT trust that he really had turned in the project. Do NOT trust that he'd have no other reason to film you topless than for the sake of art. \n\nTell him right now that you want evidence that he submitted the film when he said he did. If he provides that OR simply refuses to do so, go online, figure out who his instructor is, and tell your brother you'll contact that teacher to say you do not consent to his using any topless footage of you. Then do it. No matter how trusting you are, you MUST face the fact that your brother took advantage of your trusting nature and did something very, very wrong. If he did not submit it yet, tell him he must give you the original and show you there are no copies. Then he must cut the semi-nude scene while you watch. \n\nALSO, it is NOT a good sign that you're the only person your brother has used in his films. No film student does that, and it's definitely a sign something is wrong with your brother.", "I'm glad other people in the comments are more articulate than I am right now because at this point my brain just keeps screaming \"WHAT DID I JUST READ\" over and over between crying jags", "I get that", "I\u2019d honestly also get the police involved if I even sniffed a whiff more of resistance from him once I pushed back again. Point out that there is NO way he finished it and submitted it already and if he\u2019s still weird I\u2019d talk to his school, your parents, and the police. Brother seems like a creep.

She finally gave into the pressure and rationalized it to herself in the moment. Then afterwards told him she changed her mind and wanted the file/for it to be deleted.

How exactly did I change the story?", "Nude models who probably weren't asked to be nude 10 minutes before the job started when they were tired and foggy headed.... instead had time and space to deliberate on their decision and determine they were comfortable. heck, it's even different if its nude modeling for a sculpting or painting class vs a photo or video class.", "Gritty sees what you did there.", "i'm a little worried for OP that  has been uploaded ....to porn sites. they don't care much about mixing and editing.", "Yeah, I think perhaps I should have worded things a little more clearly. By \"in scenarios like these\", I did indeed mean \"in scenarios in which no formal releases or contracts are actually signed on the part of the subject/model\". I also should have specified that this pretty exclusively applies to public film and some photography, as the legalities are stimultaneously much looser and much more complicated when it comes to things like drawings or paintings.", "This dude spent too much time on the hub for sure.", "I mean Gianni Versace called his little sister Donatella his muse, but he was an out gay man making clothing to dress her in, not making her take her clothes off.", "I honestly didn\u2019t know muse had any romantic connotations until this moment.
