We have always been doing shoots together indoors and outdoors. \n\nRecently, he had a project for his film school, asked if I could shoot for him and kept insisting, which I didn\u2019t care as I\u2019ve always been the only person who is in his short films or shoots.\n\nI told him I\u2019ll do this and he wanted it to be fifteen minutes long. After we were done with the scenes he wanted outside, our parents were on a work stay, so we had the free house to do the shooting and no interruptions inside.\n\nIt was a scene where it was the early morning and I wake up, make a coffee, sit on my balcony and smoke. The weather was beautiful and I understood the ambience he was trying to exude. \n\nUntil before the scene, he wanted a sense of \u201cauthenticity, realism and intimacy in the scene\u201d, I asked him \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d and he said \u201cI sleep naked and it feels like a love letter to life\u201d. I proceeded to say \u201cyou want me to be naked in the short film? That you will show your fellow classmates?\u201d. He told me that \u201cthat\u2019s film and it\u2019s not weird as I am your brother. But not fully naked just topless and you can wear underwear.\u201d \n\nI didn\u2019t really care about doing this and maybe it was brain fog in the morning.

We proceeded to do it and he got it on first try. \n\nEverything was great, until I took a nap as it was very early. When I woke up, I understood the gravity of what I had done. I don\u2019t know what went through my mind at the time and why I would do something so idiotic. Most of all, just thinking about my brother having a file like that sends bile up my throat. \n\nI go back to him, ask him to give me the file so I can delete it permanently and that i wanted to redact the start where I was naked. He told me that he already \u201csubmitted it\u201d and it would be pointless if I deleted it. I felt embarrassed and sickened. I still feel greatly upset with him and haven\u2019t spoken to him. I informed him beforehand that i will not shoot for him again. He got upset and angry, told me that I was his \u201cmuse\u201d and got him into his desired film school. He told me that I was being unreasonable and turning what I did into something abhorrent, when it was \u201cart\u201d.

Your brother is what's wrong with the industry.  \"A love letter to life\" plus \"authenticity, realism and intimacy\" involves filming one's topless 18 year old sister (!) and then submitting it -- one hopes to the professor and not to his fellow-students, because if a room full of undergraduate film students have access to it , it could find its way onto the internet for all eternity?  \n\nAnd then he refuses to try to kill it (assuming he really has submitted it already; You'd think he would have had to spend some time editing it and maybe color correcting it, so it's very possible he's just plain lying.)\n\nNo, your brother's behavior would be what we call \"exploitation,\" not a handful of pseudo-Truffaut cliches.\n\nLet him know that you never agreed for him to put a film featuring your naked body into the computers of a bunch of film students, that this makes you extremely vulnerable, and that in the absence of consent, he is very likely violating rules his film school has about the making of shorts.   \n\nIf your brother is at a legitimate film school, and if the film has genuinely already been submitted, you may be able to contact his production professor, his advisor, or the dean of his branch of the film school to withdraw the film from being shown or stored anywhere that others could access it.  \n\nI also think it might make sense to talk with your parents and get them to pressure your brother to take care of this.\n\nAnd if he still plans to go public with your film, may I suggest you threaten to go public with him.  I doubt that a whole lot of female students in his program are going to be dying to work with a guy who would do this to you.  I doubt that female professors are going to be thrilled with him either. Film school students have all kinds of internet presence. So do cinematography websites.  There are chats galore.  There are all kinds of places you could post.

What he asked of you is beyond gross.", "NTA  \nAre you sure he has a film project or was he just looking for ways to whack it to your boobs?", "Ewww NTA,", "NTA, this makes me feel nauseated and also incestuous. Yuck", "AND already got him into film school!\n\nIt's for his private file... Ugh.", "Did film in high school. Can confirm there's no way this project was finished in a couple of hours. Unless the brother just uploaded the raw material and submitted that. But doubt it.\n\nNTA op", "And grooming you to do more down the line. If he keeps that file, he may try to use it as leverage to pressure you into doing things you don\u2019t want to do. A couple of other comments suggested contacting the teacher, the school, and telling your parents - please do all three, OP. Your brother pressured you to do something you weren\u2019t comfortable with and then refused to give the file to you/delete it when you, again, told him it made you uncomfortable and you didn\u2019t want to participate in his film in this way. His behavior is not okay and he should have respected your being uncomfortable. \n\nWhen you email the school, let them know you\u2019re his SISTER and you do not consent to being in his film project and that you told brother knew this.  That you were filmed topless and want to film destroyed/removed from all school records otherwise you\u2019ll take legal action.", "I read that book this summer only because I have seen it referenced multiple times on Reddit lmao. Even read the 2nd one too.\n\n\nThis post is wild.", "Came here to say this", "Fucking hell took me forever to see a comment like this! Like??? Girl, him asking you to be topless wast a red flag?? Like let's talk about that too.", "Even if OP signed a release at the start of the project (before shooting the outdoor scenes), that shouldn't cover a complete change of the nature of the planned shoot to a nude/partially nude shoot.", "Girl I hope you stopped seeing him after that", "Talk to his school. Tell them his project contains clips of you that he's fully aware he doesn't have your permission for, and that he's ignored your requests to delete the footage. If possible, have a conversation over text with him about it and get him refusing *over text*, so you can send that to the school as proof. Even better if he lies about having already submitted it, because the school will know exactly when he submitted it.\n\nWord it as a sexual harassment issue: \"He knew he did not have consent to submit a project involving my naked body\" - to an institution, that can easily sound like a lawsuit waiting to happen if they don't take action.", "This! And get your parents involved so you can make sure it's deleted at home too", "I have a follow up question, possibly less for you, and more for everyone else.\n\n>I couldn\u2019t be asked\n\nIt's, couldn't be *arsed*, right? I swear this is the second time I've seen \"asked\" used in this way recently, and I don't know if I can think of a time I've seen it written prior to that. And I know a lot of English speakers say \"asked\" very similar to \"arsed\".  \n\n\nI have a genuine fear right now I've been saying this phrase wrong for a long time, and I need validation.", "Yeah, especially with their parents out of town", "Likely not their siblings", "Yea- but I assume they signed a RELEASE AND CONTRACT giving you consent for exactly what those images can be used for?", "But we do.\n\nAnd probably we are right.", "Honestly each of her comments reeks of b s. There's no way this is a real post.", "It's arsed/assed. OP is drinking the bone apple tea.", "No you are correct", "Probably fake tbh. Or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m telling myself", "Don\u2019t underestimate how weird things can get in real life", "Eh.. idk, I don't think that many people have siblings there comfortable with and close to. If more people did i think it would be more popular", "If OP is American, assed and asked can sound like the same word, so it would make sense that she would make that mistake.", "Roll tide!", "And they certainly don't freak out and call their sibling their \"muse\". Which has a romantic connotation.", "I'm very close and comfortable with my sister and we don't mind changing/sitting in sauna (in my country people do it nude) together. I would not be comfortable to use her as a naked \"muse\". That's some Alabama type of shit", "To be fair, it doesn\u2019t _have_ to have a romantic connotation. It just does, like, 85% of the time.", "\"Scenarios like these\" is actually pretty specific in-context, but sure, whatever floats your boat. \n\nIt's quite ironic that you \"reject that energy full stop\" when it's the exact same energy you yourself are currently giving off. Usually I'd apologize for the miscommunication if my tone/wording came across as hostile, but in general I tend to reject the energy of any stranger on the Internet who calls me \"bitchy\" just for disagreeing with them, so. Have the day you deserve!"]}
