You're better than this. Let them bro it out and just leave. There's a whole world out there waiting for you.

I mean what pressure is he talking about here ? This was the original agreement", "NTA. You\u2019re not obligated to stay in a living arrangement and relationship that\u2019s not working for you. I\u2019m glad you know your own boundaries.", "NTA but he picked his friend over you. You might want to think about that a little more than you have.", "NTA and you don't have to be ok with it. It sounds like this relationship has run its course. It's completely reasonable for you not to want the friend there but your partner is making you the bad guy in the situation. You will be happier if you leave and the friend stays.", "Should you just be ok with it?\n\nIt\u2019s not a matter of yes or no, it\u2019s a matter of are you or aren\u2019t you. You aren\u2019t, so you speak up as you did. I\u2019m sorry there were tears and words. NTA at all.", "NTA. Maybe you should leave until the friend is gone? Doesn't sound like you'd actually miss him much more than you already do, and maybe you'll be around people (friends) who value you more.", "NTA\n\nBut perhaps you need to move out anyway. Not break up, necessarily, but move out, date each other, and be excited to see each other again.\n\nAnd not live together somewhere where he feels he gets to make the decisions about who lives there and who stays, and guilts you when you don\u2019t agree.", "OP he wants a frat brother and not a gf.  Your bf's family warned you and your bf is ignoring you as best as possible to avoid dealing with the situation.  The house is not under your name at all, so you have no legal say in the matter who stays there, so your best decision is to just seriously move on and avoid the same scenario next time and make sure you have a legal leg to stand on when it comes to your name on the mortgage or the lease before anyone outside of your relationship moving in.  Do not even give him the benefit of the doubt he'll change his mind if you give him any ultimatum because he'll just either gaslight you or extend \"the talk\" and blame you for making him do it.  He's not going to put your needs ahead of his friend's.   \nBest of luck to you.", "NTA.  You\u2019re allowed to have a home without his friend couch surfing indefinitely.", "I don\u2019t know what FIFO means and Google is no help! Anyway, is where you\u2019re living, is it hard to find a place to live? Where I live, it\u2019s wild for rentals, and a 1 bedroom is like $2200. But anyway, has the friend been looking for places, if he had decency, he shouldn\u2019t want to overstay his welcome, and should want some privacy if his own, no? Also your partner is caught between his girlfriend and his best friend, except there are solutions, if everyone just agreed to the original plan. Are you looking for a place in case the 4 weeks comes and he still doesn\u2019t move out? You are NTA for not letting him stay, but I\u2019m wondering, the first few weeks/month, how did you guys get along!? What is this friend like?", "NTA.  I wouldn't want someone hanging around my house.  \n\nHowever, \"got into a fight\" is a troubling phrase.  The only difference between a discussion and a fight is that a fight requires that there be a lack of respect for one another.", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t agree to it and have every right not to be comfortable with it, the best friend can also  afford his own place anyway", "NTA but this doesn\u2019t sound good for the two of you.", "NTA for wanting him out! However, it seems your bf is choosing his bff over you, remember that. Also, him paying off his mortgage while you pay for everything else isn't fair. You should be splitting the bills and groceries, as you both are using those. He has all the advantages here, someone to buy his food for him, and someone who hasn't yet complained that his bff is living there.\n\nI'd suggest just finding another place for yourself (how much you talk to him about it is up to you, but he might want to kick you out if it goes that badly, and that might leave you in a tight spot, so be careful). He isn't as invested in your relationship as you are, and you deserve way better. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. \n\nBut at least they\u2019re doing housework. Most of the posts on here where a guy moves some buddy in with himself and his girl, the dude doesn\u2019t clean up after himself and so, I guess that\u2019s the only silver lining here?", "Best friend moves in, and now Bf barely spend time with you.\n\nYou should not be OKAY with that.\n\nHe doesn't get it.  He doesn't see how friend is a third wheel in the house.  He enjoys doing rein things in his spare time, and now that is all he does.  He get to play.  He also tries to make you out as the bad guy for putting pressure on him.  \n\nHe wants you in the bedroom, and his friend there to play with him.  He doesn't have to grow up.\n\nMy advice is to just leave.  Don't give him a warning or an ultimatum.   Just tell him you can't live in the house with his best friend.  \n\nNTa", "NTA for wanting your home back. But, honestly, it's probably better to just leave. Your partner has already made it clear his BFF is his priority and picked him. Leave them to it and find someone who actually wants to be with you.", "ESH This is on you. You didn't want to be that girlfriend, even though you were warned. Now, it's obvious, you are living in a frat house. \nMy guess is you either do the majority of the cooking and cleaning, or part a significant portion of the bills.  I wish I could move in for$100-$150 a week! I promise to clean up after myself!\nIt's time to go, because when you finally say no more, your BF will shame you into repenting, because you are now \"that girlfriend.\"\nBeware of People Pleasing.

My sister just broke up with her boyfriend on 9 years for this same bullshit. He put his friend above her, and they all mistreated and didn't appreciate all she did to make it work for all of them. He was family and it sucks. But I am so proud of her for seeing her worth. If he wants a room mate instead of a life partner, tell him you will leave.", "NTA but you should be the one to leave, he\u2019s clearly not okay with being forced to choose and it shouldn\u2019t be a choice, tbh.
