She recently got a job at Starbucks and is saving up for a home. This is fine except she and her daughter (8) eat everything in my fridge and leave little to none for my fianc\u00e9 or me.

When Sophia got home we talked to her and told her that we would start charging her $500 a month to cover her and her daughter's expenses. She freaked out and complained that this was an insane amount to live in the basement, I told her that I thought it was fair since the basement is furnished and equipped with a king bed and entertainment station, this $500 would also go towards things liked food, utilities, bills, and other such expenses. We told her we thought this was a fair amount because it's in Boston and it covers everything.\n\nSo reddit am I the asshole? Is $500 a month really too much to expect her to pay?\n\nEdit: Yes, we have talked to her about it but she just shrugs us off saying something along the lines \"Sorry, I forgot.\" or \"I just didn't think about.\"\n\nAnd we thought $500 was fair because it would at least cover some of their living expenses while still allowing her save up.

The other problem is that when it's \"free\", the \"guest\" often refuses to pay even when they can afford to do so, and just as often refuses to leave if asked nicely.  Honestly, your generosity is astonishing.  You're a good friend, but perhaps you're TOO good of a friend.  You now have a perfectly rentable space that is filled with someone who absolutely refuses to see the value in what she is taking up, and there is no contract, either verbal or in writing, to let her know when her gravy train ends.  For her, this is a free ride with no legal end to it.  The value of what she gets is 100% coming out of the pocket of your fianc\u00e9 and you.  As I said...TOO generous.  Your fianc\u00e9 and you were raised to be good humans, but good humans often get used.\n\nYou're also learning why Sophia did not have anyone else to help her little family:  she probably took shameless advantage of similar situations with other families.  Does her daughter not have a father who is paying child support?    Shouldn't there be income from that person, or from public assistance?  Heck, she even qualifies for free medical care.  Money is there if she needs it to get out on her own.  But I suspect it is much more convenient for her to let your fianc\u00e9 and you pay for everything.  And she is going to continue to do so until you finally get sick of it and kick her out.  Yes, it's coming.  You probably suspected it the moment your friend balked at paying $500 for the privilege of using your basement space, because she inadvertently revealed that she expects you to continue footing her bills for as long as SHE decides you should do so.  I wonder, what will happen if you tell her that your fianc\u00e9 and you can no longer afford to support her, and if she cannot pay rent, she needs to find another place to go posthaste?  My guess is that she will suddenly cease to become a friend, and more of a malevolent presence in the home you pay for.\n\nMy daughter has a similarly soft heart for friends.  At times over the past 5 years, she has \"helped\" up to five people by letting them stay with her husband and her.  The result?  Those \"friends\" would not pay for rent or food, would not clean up their own messes, would not reimburse for gas or wear/tear on her car, and several of them stole everything of value that they could find when she finally kicked them to the curb.  They acted like spoiled teenagers who expected my daughter and her wife to pay for and do everything for them.  One person stole her engagement ring, and that ring is gone for good.  Another person stole jewelry that she had inherited, and several gaming systems and games that her husband had.  Again, gone for good, and probably pawned for a tenth of its cash value.  She would not have ever suspected her \"friends\" would use her and steal from her, but yeah, it happened repeatedly.  A person who is happy to live rent-free on your dime and \"steal\" that space usually has no qualms about stealing other things if they want those things.\n\nToday, my daughter and her husband have a rule:  if someone needs a place to stay, it's not going to be their place.  The last time someone asked, my daughter said, \"Yeah, that's a sad story, but we can't afford to support ourselves and you, too.  You're going to need to find some other place to crash.\"  She learned the hard way that house guests take a shockingly short time to become freeloaders who consistently feign outrage when they realize they have to pay for their own expenses.\n\nYou are neither Sophia's parent nor her keeper.  I would highly recommend first having a difficult conversation with Sophia:  telling her what public assistance is available to her, and giving her links to those agencies that can financially help her as she transitions to living on her own.  I also highly recommend consulting with an attorney, then serving her with an eviction notice.  In the meantime, put locks on doors of rooms you do not want Sophia to access, and make sure that if you have things of value, they stay in those locked rooms.  The thefts usually start when the guests realize they are no longer welcome, and when they can no longer use you with your permission.  Cheapen the quality of the foods you have at your home to reduce comfort, and perhaps invest in a mini fridge to keep in your bedroom so that if there are things you buy solely for your consumption, they will still be there when you come home.  And finally, take your cell phone and take videos of your home and its contents, including the serial number of big-ticket items, and including the contents of the basement.  When you finally get your \"friend\" out of there, chances are good that she is going to take a few things with her.  You'll need that video, along with the serial numbers, for the police report.\n\nI sincerely hope that things don't come to that point.  However, Sophia's refusal to pay rent does not bode well for your future with her, or for your friendship.", "Charge her rent,and she has to buy her own food,period . bottom line you have been more then generous.you are feeling taken advantage of.shes working now.If there's a refrigerator downstairs,then she doesn't need to eat you out of yours.", "NTA $500 is too low when you even include the food they are barfing down.\n\nHere in Germany you'll not get a flat for that low amount.

I have a feeling this attitude of hers got her in this mess in the first place.", "NTA and why does she complain? She got a rent and eat free year and still does not realize how lucky she is? Weird 'friend' you have! Edit: oh and please give us an update on what you did", "NTA and give her an ultimatum and a lease. Please check and make sure that you can legally evict her ASAP.", "NTA. She can leave if she doesn\u2019t want to pay it. It\u2019s unreasonable for her to not contribute when you are even providing food", "NTA - if she doesn\u2019t like the flat fee, then tell her that she is to pay for all groceries and that there better be food left in the house for you and your fianc\u00e9 to eat.  That you are tired of going to get something to eat or use on a dish only to find out that it\u2019s all gone or just a smidge left.\nTry paying for the groceries and the additional utilities and that is probably more than the 500 that your asking for .\n\nYour mistake was in not wording it as charge for food and utilities but as rent for the basement area.\n\nYou need to have another discussion with her about the grocery situation and hopefully you can have proof of the added expenses that you have been covering for her for the past year.\n\nOtherwise, it just might be time for her and her daughter to leave.", "Tell her you will price match per square foot for an equivalent space with equivalent amenities - if she can provide the listing. This will also include the \"hidden costs\" deposits, taxes, etc. And she Will need to buy her own groceries.  I bet that will open her eyes to how little you are requesting in this economy.", "NTA\n\nI'd get a lock her kid can't get into to lock your food up in as well if kicking her out doesn't work (not sure if she's now considered a tenant or not by your state). Depending on the law you might have to serve her eviction papers to kick her out.", "NTA. her reaction tells me not only is she happy to take advantage of you, but she feels she's entitled to it. charge $500, write up a lease (make sure there are terms that protect you both), and make some house rules.\n\nif she doesn't like it, she can go pay $1200 rent (or whatever I don't live in Boston) for the equivalent space.", "YTA, but not for wanting rent. Mainly for springing it on her out of seemingly nowhere. \n\nIMO, this seems more like a \"Because we're just telling you this now, we're not going to start this month. But in the first of next month, we'd like a check/cash/money ap of choice\" situation.\n\nAnd then you get it in writing.", "Info: did you talk to her about finishing all the food and leaving nothing for others? It looks like you left it for so long the irritation kinda exploded. You basically did a 180 where it might be hard for the roommate to see this coming. Also charging her this much might prohibit her from saving and leaving (what the goal is ultimately).\nI think I would begin a conversation with her about what she can contribute now she has a job. And about her not being a jerk with your food.", "NTA. You know you are going to have to kick her out, right?", "This sounds reasonable to me", "Where I live, rent has gone up an insane amount recently, so much so that a previously $500/month unfurnished bachelor apartment w/o utilities is now $1400-1600/month. $500/month for two people in 1/2 or 1/3 of your house is incredible... __especially__ when it includes furnishings, utilities __and__ groceries!", "i've paid $2400 for a basement in boston with far less space and amenities. i also had to pay for my own food, utilities, furniture, etc.\n\n**STRONG** NTA", "I\u2019m not sure how easy it is to throw someone out in Boston. It\u2019s extremely difficult in NY especially a child. NTA", "NTA but I'd just end the arrangement altogether. It's been a year, she hasn't paid anything and feels comfortable enough to eat all your groceries.  No good deed goes unpunished as the saying goes.", "You realize she's never going to leave, right?   Saving up for a home at minimum wage, even if you're fully subsidizing her rent, isn't going to happen.  NTA", "INFO: does their basement room have windows? If not, I believe charging them rent is illegal in Mass.\n\nhttps://masslandlords.net/do-landlords-have-to-provide-window-coverings-in-massachusetts-2/", "Including food? For two people, 500 a month barely covers it these days.", "I've talked to her before about it. I asked her to save some or tell me when it's empty when it's empty but she just shrugs if off. And I'm charging her because my fianc\u00e9 and I really can't afford to pay all her and her daughter's living anymore, however I still don't want so we agreed make her contribute a small amount.", "ThaT is insanely little to charge, right.", "I don\u2019t live in Boston and COL is much lower in my area, but if I could pay $500 a month in rent, I would probably not still be living with my parents at 25. NTA.", "Does it have windows?\n\nBecause if I am reading this correctly, it is required for rented rooms to have windows in Mass.  https://masslandlords.net/do-landlords-have-to-provide-window-coverings-in-massachusetts-2/\n\nJust because your predecessors rented it doesn\u2019t mean it is actually legal. \n\nIf it has windows, then great, no problem.", "Not shopping, just taking from OP's fridge ;)", "The friend will eat more when she starts paying the $500 per month.", "Lol \"starts paying\". I greatly enjoy this optimism.", "They should just put a mini fridge and a hot plate in the basement and tell Sophia that's she's responsible for her and her daughter's food from now on. $500 should only covers rent & utilities ( which is still insanely cheap). Of course get all of this onto a formal rental agreement so there won't be any shenanigans going on."]}
