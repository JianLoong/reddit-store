When Sophia got home we talked to her and told her that we would start charging her $500 a month to cover her and her daughter's expenses. She freaked out and complained that this was an insane amount to live in the basement, I told her that I thought it was fair since the basement is furnished and equipped with a king bed and entertainment station, this $500 would also go towards things liked food, utilities, bills, and other such expenses. We told her we thought this was a fair amount because it's in Boston and it covers everything.\n\nSo reddit am I the asshole?

The other problem is that when it's \"free\", the \"guest\" often refuses to pay even when they can afford to do so, and just as often refuses to leave if asked nicely.  Honestly, your generosity is astonishing.  You're a good friend, but perhaps you're TOO good of a friend.  You now have a perfectly rentable space that is filled with someone who absolutely refuses to see the value in what she is taking up, and there is no contract, either verbal or in writing, to let her know when her gravy train ends.  For her, this is a free ride with no legal end to it.  The value of what she gets is 100% coming out of the pocket of your fianc\u00e9 and you.  As I said...TOO generous.  Your fianc\u00e9 and you were raised to be good humans, but good humans often get used.\n\nYou're also learning why Sophia did not have anyone else to help her little family:  she probably took shameless advantage of similar situations with other families.  Does her daughter not have a father who is paying child support?    Shouldn't there be income from that person, or from public assistance?  Heck, she even qualifies for free medical care.  Money is there if she needs it to get out on her own.  But I suspect it is much more convenient for her to let your fianc\u00e9 and you pay for everything.  And she is going to continue to do so until you finally get sick of it and kick her out.  Yes, it's coming.  You probably suspected it the moment your friend balked at paying $500 for the privilege of using your basement space, because she inadvertently revealed that she expects you to continue footing her bills for as long as SHE decides you should do so.  I wonder, what will happen if you tell her that your fianc\u00e9 and you can no longer afford to support her, and if she cannot pay rent, she needs to find another place to go posthaste?  My guess is that she will suddenly cease to become a friend, and more of a malevolent presence in the home you pay for.\n\nMy daughter has a similarly soft heart for friends.  At times over the past 5 years, she has \"helped\" up to five people by letting them stay with her husband and her.  The result?  Those \"friends\" would not pay for rent or food, would not clean up their own messes, would not reimburse for gas or wear/tear on her car, and several of them stole everything of value that they could find when she finally kicked them to the curb.  They acted like spoiled teenagers who expected my daughter and her wife to pay for and do everything for them.  One person stole her engagement ring, and that ring is gone for good.  Another person stole jewelry that she had inherited, and several gaming systems and games that her husband had.  Again, gone for good, and probably pawned for a tenth of its cash value.  She would not have ever suspected her \"friends\" would use her and steal from her, but yeah, it happened repeatedly.  A person who is happy to live rent-free on your dime and \"steal\" that space usually has no qualms about stealing other things if they want those things.\n\nToday, my daughter and her husband have a rule:  if someone needs a place to stay, it's not going to be their place.  The last time someone asked, my daughter said, \"Yeah, that's a sad story, but we can't afford to support ourselves and you, too.  You're going to need to find some other place to crash.\"  She learned the hard way that house guests take a shockingly short time to become freeloaders who consistently feign outrage when they realize they have to pay for their own expenses.\n\nYou are neither Sophia's parent nor her keeper.  I would highly recommend first having a difficult conversation with Sophia:  telling her what public assistance is available to her, and giving her links to those agencies that can financially help her as she transitions to living on her own.  I also highly recommend consulting with an attorney, then serving her with an eviction notice.  In the meantime, put locks on doors of rooms you do not want Sophia to access, and make sure that if you have things of value, they stay in those locked rooms.  The thefts usually start when the guests realize they are no longer welcome, and when they can no longer use you with your permission.  Cheapen the quality of the foods you have at your home to reduce comfort, and perhaps invest in a mini fridge to keep in your bedroom so that if there are things you buy solely for your consumption, they will still be there when you come home.  And finally, take your cell phone and take videos of your home and its contents, including the serial number of big-ticket items, and including the contents of the basement.  When you finally get your \"friend\" out of there, chances are good that she is going to take a few things with her.  You'll need that video, along with the serial numbers, for the police report.\n\nI sincerely hope that things don't come to that point.  However, Sophia's refusal to pay rent does not bode well for your future with her, or for your friendship.", "Charge her rent,and she has to buy her own food,period . bottom line you have been more then generous.you are feeling taken advantage of.shes working now.If there's a refrigerator downstairs,then she doesn't need to eat you out of yours.", "NTA $500 is too low when you even include the food they are barfing down.\n\nHere in Germany you'll not get a flat for that low amount.

She was lucky to have free rent for so long. She can help out with expenses.", "NTA. While offering her the place to stay was a nice thing, she is now mooching off you in regards to food and such. It sounds like she is not contributing anything back towards the groceries. Assuming she is working full time(ish) and bringing home biweekly checks with 70 or more hours on them, she can afford the 500 and still save for getting on her own.\n\nStarbucks in my area pays around 14-16/hour starting pay, plus tip-share. This is not great, but can still allow that level of responsibility. If the Boston area pays higher, then even more so.", "NTA she should be offering you money rather than you having to ask her for some.", "NTA\n\nWhoah......500 a month for rent, ulitities and food in Bahstahn?!?  That's real dirt cheap!  Sign me up and I'll be there in 2.5 hours, LOL.   My suggestion to you is tell her go and look for a place less than 500 dollars and get back to you to tell you how much are the rent in one or two bedroom apartment.  She'll sing a different tune. And also, tell her to go grocery shopping and see how much they cost for a week or a month whatever.  Again she'll sing a different tune.", "NTA.  If she can forget and not think about it, maybe $500 a month will help her memory of taking advantage of someone helping her and her daughter out and keeping them from being homeless.", "NTA.  Hey, I'd jump at the chance to pay $500 for that situation.  You may need to look into getting your friend out of the basement if she won't even pay this nominal amount.  Also - is the agreement that she can stay until she saves up for a house?  Because that's like 500 years of Starbucks employment, right?", "NTA. She shouldn\u2019t be using your groceries or eating your food at all. I get that you were trying to help her out and she had no income, but she should have been paying something towards food and utilities (or going to a food bank or other assistance program if she wasn\u2019t able to pay). You and your fianc\u00e9 are already doing a massive favour by giving the 2 of them a place to stay, you shouldn\u2019t be covering all of their expenses. \n\nIs it a basement suite, or part of your living space? If it\u2019s separate they shouldn\u2019t be coming in to your kitchen at all. If the kitchen is shared then you should start labeling food or assign a shelf/part of the fridge and cupboards to her (or put a mini-fridge in the basement). Make sure that you tell BOTH of them that they are only allowed to eat their own food, and make her pay you back when they \u201cforget.\u201d It\u2019s fine to share the occasional meal (if you\u2019re okay with that) but there\u2019s no reason that you should have 2 extra mouths to feed, especially if she\u2019s working again. There are usually benefits available to single parents with low income, so she should be applying for whatever help she can get. If she can\u2019t afford to buy her own groceries AND pay you a little bit of rent, she is never going to be able to afford to actually move out. She needs to start budgeting and planning in a realistic way, and this could be a good first step to getting her out on her own.", "NTA. I'm shocked to see you're dipping into your own savings to support this \"friend.\" It's time to look into the residency laws in Boston to find out how much notice you need to give her to move out. Then present to her in writing that she either starts paying $500/month on X date, or she moves by Y date.", "NTA. She's living rent free, utility free, and not paying a dime for food, while she and her daughter eat everything at sight. It is reasonable to charge them for rent, but you wouldn't be able to use the  basement since it would be \"her\" property, or at least she would be paying for it. \n\n\nAnd as other peers have said, If she doesn't agree with this, then give her a deadline to leave and find herself a place to live (which she will obviously need to pay more for rent and will end up agreeing with you and your fianc\u00e9)", "Likely NTA.  \nWhat is the average rental prices on a 2 bedroom apartment in your area? Only reason I ask that is to gauge where the 500 sits in comparison to that(plus utilities/etc).  \n\n\nIn general though the point they are basically treating the lodging as a bed and breakfast is showing they're trying to mooch as much as they can.", "I didn\u2019t know houses in Boston have basements now. More likely you\u2019re in a gateway city and $500 *is* a lot for a basement apartment, however with the food costs factored in I am gonna go with NTA.", "I will. My step aunt  is a real estate attorney, I'm meeting with her today to work the situation out.", "Oh I\u2019m sure. I pay $1,780 a month for a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom in Orlando and that\u2019s just rent.", "Thing I hated most about a basement roommate was using our kitchen. Absolutely I'd be throwing in a hot plate and cheap used fridge or something to keep them out of our kitchen. They can also buy their own toaster or toaster oven and whatever else...\n\nBut definitely charge the rent regardless. I'd never let anyone stay rent free in my house. If she thinks it's too expensive, then it's time for her to go and find a more reasonable place to RENT. and she won't.  Definitely NTA\n\nEdit. I'd gladly do the mini kitchen also the keep them in the basement and not using your house at all. No one using your TV, using your bathroom or kitchen, using any of your space. Absolutely detest the thought of having another person wandering around my house.... I'd love to have a house with a separate entrance to really put up space, but giving them the basement and expecting them to live and stay down there most of the time is fair in my books.", "cuz yeah, that's my problem.\n\nshe's been living with you expense free for a year and she's all \"how dare you charge me rent.\" all i've been doing is costing all sorts of extra money in food and utilities for you to house me and my child, while we've obviously been the easiest guests to have have ever.", ">  She freaked out and complained that this was an insane amount to live in the basement   \n    \nNTA, look up other basement rentals in your area, find the market rate.  Let Sophia know you will be charging market rate + utilities, and that you will clear a space for them to put food in the fridge and a cupboard.  That food is no longer shared, for them or their daughter, and a year is more than generous for free rent and food.", "NTA but definitely look into the tenant laws in your area, as you might be looking at legal action to remove this \"friend\".", "She has lived for free with you for so long that she feels entitled to your stuff. I doubt she will pay, and it will be a problem every month to try to get a little money from her. NTA, but you need to make some tough decisions on how long you can support them/", "NTA, she should be relieved to have a nice place to live in Boston for only $500, especially since she and her daughter are rudely eating all of your food without replacing it.", "YWBTA if you don't follow thru with this 100% to yourself and your fiance. This is abuse plan and simple.", "YTA.

Even texts. Legally speaking you could really screw yourself over. This basement doesn't sound like it could be inspected, approved and legally rented. You could end up owing her money if she had it inspected and filed against you in court. Remember, no good deed goes unpunished. The hotplate idea is a really bad one. What happens if there is a fire. Tell her you need your basement back and give her 60 days to leave.", "NTA - $500 is a STEAL for two people.", "NTA, seems fair, especially after a year of no rent.  They are always welcome to move somewhere else.", "NTA, $500 to live in Boston? Can I live in your basement??", "Omg I\u2019ve heard of parking spots that cost that a month in Boston!! That\u2019s a ridiculous deal she should feel lucky for!! Time she finds a job, a man, or another friend she can use!", "NTA.  When you are living rent free you should be more considerate of things.  If she was buying groceries or contributing to the electric bill, I would be more lenient, but as far as I can see she's paying nothing.  $500 a month is a steal for a studio apartment like set up where you are not paying for food or electricity/gas.", "500 dollar studio apartment? Sophia sounds like a gift-horse-mouth-looker type", "NTA\n\nDid she not work for the past year?  In a year, she ought to have been able to save up enough to pay for her and her daughter's food, as well as first, last, and a security deposit.\n\nHow is she going to save up for a house on income from Starbucks?  With you subsidizing her entire life.\n\nWhy are you allowing yourselves to be used?\n\nI'd start the eviction process.", "> $500/month will barely cover food for two people\n\nwhat the fuck are you talking about?", "But then she wouldn't have the endless supply of food paid for by someone else's bank account!", "> throw her out if she doesn't agree\n\nNot disagreeing but OP is now a landlord and will have to legally evict her so 'throwing her out' is maybe not the best phrasing here", "And they\u2019ve been living rent free for a year.
