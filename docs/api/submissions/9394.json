I agree it wouldn\u2019t be more than once a month for flying but could be longer periods of time in the summer or all school breaks, etc. that would minimize flights but still give the mom time with her daughter. Agreed with another commenter: does your daughter not want to fly that often or does she not want time with her mom? That\u2019s the important thing to determine in my eyes", "If you both had 50/50 custody why were you even allowed to take the kid with you?", "Don\u2019t forget the girl probably has it drilled into her head to say:\n\n\u201cAnd as you tell me all the time\u201d *checks OPs comments* \u201cI have it all and I have a comfortable life and I am happy\u201d", "No there isn\u2019t but no one is leaving a 6 figure job to do it.", "He doesn't live in the US or Canada.

Are you proud of yourself for taking a child away from her mother knowing full well she doesn't have the resources to fight for her in court?", "Wow you\u2019re a shitty person", "So, because she can't afford to take you to court, she shouldn't be allowed to see her child. I'm really curious as to the laws in your country. Here, you would not only be arrested for custodial interference (no attorney needed, just the police) you could also be charged with kidnapping!

At least one of us needs to have money and it's obviously not her", "The inability to be a good parent and therefore not being able to get custody the first time we went to court does though", "ESH.  You and your ex need to head back to court to get the custody agreement amended to reflect the distance.  How the distance came to be is immaterial now.  It is a fact that needs to be dealt with.  Your daughter is 14, so what she wants should be taken into account.  Good luck to you all working this out.", "I think you were wrong to move the daughter that far away from her mother. Shame on you for that, unless you have good reason. That being said, I think it is unreasonable to expect the daughter to spend every weekend traveling. It makes me tired just thinking about it. What about her school activities? Perhaps you should discuss a new arrangement where daughter spends holidays, school breaks, and the summer with mom.", "This needs to be brought in front of a judge and he can decide if you're TA, honestly. Your argument makes sense to me, but it needs to be brought to your attorney to get a court order that solidifies whose role it is to buy the tickets. It'll probably go in your favor.", "Nta", "ESH \n\nThis should have been figured out before you moved away. That failure falls on both of you. Get it fixed now so at least the poor kid isn\u2019t stuck in the middle of this mess", "YTA If you moved away without notifying the court and you have a custody agreement in place with set weekly visitation, you\u2019re still responsible for making sure that visitation happens or that you get the order revised.", "YTA for alienating your daughter from her mother. You are really f&@king your daughter over.\n\nTo be clear, you are AH for moving your daughter away without permission.

You can\u2019t have that much distance and not expect it to effect the child\u2019s parental relationship.", "YTA for moving so far away knowing you had joint custody. You moved, you pay for any and all plane tix for your daughter to see her mom.", "YTA, even more so based on your comments. I hope your ex managed to get the cash together to take this to court, Judge will rip you apart for messing up visitation like this.", "YTA.   You're the one that moved.

Clearly money is the most important thing in your life.", "Would everyone here be as bothered if he were the mom? No, because then you'd label him a deadbeat and be done with it.

The person I'm concerned with here is the kid.  When a parent (either parent) wants to move a kid out of easy reach of the other parent, the issue is how this impacts the kid.  If the court has ordered weekend visitation for the mom, the custodial parent (father) has put himself in violation unless an alternate agreement has been arrived at, and the court has signed off on this as being in the daughter's best interests.  I haven't weighed in on who's the A because we don't have enough info to know what's best for the kid, I've just raised a bunch of questions and concerns.", "I\u2019ll bring the popcorn!", "Then its squarely on you to pay for the tickets and maintain the visitation schedule\n\nHope mom realises she needs to take you to court if you dont shape up quickly", "YTA.

We don't know Mom or what country this is, but OP said not the US.", "YTA. Did it ever occur to you that she doesn't feel comfortable asking you to spend money you are clearly bitter about spending on plane tickets, so she doesn't ask to see her mom as often as she'd like?", "What does the court agreement say about moving your daughter prohibitively far away from the other parent?", "Are you really this dense? It\u2019s about what\u2019s best for your CHILD not your ex.", "But you should plan you life based on what works better for your daughter.....", "Obviously you don\u2019t give any thought to what works better for your daughter either.", "Pfft 6 figures? Big Baller", "OP I\u2019m aware he said he\u2019s not from the states. I\u2019m also aware he claims mom has visitation when it\u2019s suppose to be every weekend. That\u2019s partial custody. He also brags that she could take him back to court but she can\u2019t afford it. And what\u2019s best for his daughter is she\u2019s with him because he can buy her love. I\u2019m pretty sure agreements are the same everywhere. You either follow them or they are consequences. The consequences is what varies. Bottom line is OP took the daughter to another country because he knew damn well there was nothing the mom could afford to do about it.", "Op does not give two shits about his daughter. OP is 100% an asshole. Ex might be as well, but geeze OP, you could not be a bigger asshole if you tried.", "That stereotype is not true, and never has been.

I was active duty military and my ex-husband wasn't... Guess who got custody of our son and then neglected him and abused him for seven years. Don't worry the state finally intervened after I spent $75,000 trying to get him out of that awful situation.", "I think a better assumption would be that the parent who can afford weekly or monthly plane tickets (ie the OP) is getting better legal representation than his former partner who can't.", "Not even close to true", "It's easier to get away with being controlling and abusive if she doesn't have anyone she trusts nearby.", "Idk I feel like if he cared he would\u2019ve gotten court approval to move, but he didn\u2019t", "They have split custody and OP didn\u2019t get court approval to move away", "Yes it\u2019s is true, plenty of studies to prove it.\n\nWhen fathers fight for custody they\u2019re more likely to get it than not - however only a minority of fathers do it, so the mother gets primary custody more. \n\nThe one case you witnessed does not translate into \u201cCourts everywhere do this.\u201d It is an anecdote. Anecdotes are not data. They are not statistics.\n\n\u201cA Massachusetts study examined 2,100 fathers who asked for custody and pushed aggressively to win it. Of those 2,100, 92 percent either received full or joint custody, with mothers receiving full custody only 7 percent of the time. Another study where 8 percent of fathers asked for custody showed that of that 8 percent, 79 percent received either sole or joint custody (in other words, approximately 6.3 percent of all fathers in the study).\u201d\n\nStart with reading:\n\nhttps://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-269.pdf\n\nhttps://amptoons.com/blog/files/Massachusetts_Gender_Bias_Study.htm\n\nhttps://www.jaacap.org/article/S0002-7138(09)60056-X/pdf\n\nIt\u2019s asking that makes the difference, and that\u2019s exactly what the person you\u2019re replying to stipulates. \n\nYou have fallen for a myth that actually put fathers off asking; they think like you do so they don\u2019t ask so the mother gets custody more often. And round and round we go.
