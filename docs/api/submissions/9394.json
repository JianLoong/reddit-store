I agree it wouldn\u2019t be more than once a month for flying but could be longer periods of time in the summer or all school breaks, etc. that would minimize flights but still give the mom time with her daughter. Agreed with another commenter: does your daughter not want to fly that often or does she not want time with her mom? That\u2019s the important thing to determine in my eyes", "If you both had 50/50 custody why were you even allowed to take the kid with you?", "Don\u2019t forget the girl probably has it drilled into her head to say:\n\n\u201cAnd as you tell me all the time\u201d *checks OPs comments* \u201cI have it all and I have a comfortable life and I am happy\u201d", "No there isn\u2019t but no one is leaving a 6 figure job to do it.", "He doesn't live in the US or Canada.  Those laws might not apply where he lives.", "We didn't I was always the primary parent.\n\nAs I said she can take me back to court for taking our daughter away.. but oh wait she actually can't afford it", "You're so condescending. Are you proud of yourself for taking a child away from her mother knowing full well she doesn't have the resources to fight for her in court?", "Wow you\u2019re a shitty person", "So, because she can't afford to take you to court, she shouldn't be allowed to see her child. I'm really curious as to the laws in your country. Here, you would not only be arrested for custodial interference (no attorney needed, just the police) you could also be charged with kidnapping! YTA", "An inability to go back and forth to court does not make someone a bad parent.", "I had to move for my job. The same job that I need to keep to be able to raise my daughter.  At least one of us needs to have money and it's obviously not her", "The inability to be a good parent and therefore not being able to get custody the first time we went to court does though"]}
