Maybe a location and job change will benefit her also.", "I\u2019m so sorry. I hope your boy is doing ok. Good on you for fighting for him. \n\nI read posts like this, and then comments like yours, and shake my head at people who still perpetuate the lie that courts favor moms. They absolutely don\u2019t.", "Why does OP think his options are move away or McDonald\u2019s lol", "So you think it\u2019s okay he broke a court agreement? It\u2019s okay he broke the law? It\u2019s okay he only did it because he knows his ex can\u2019t afford a lawyer? You think all of this is okay?", "This alone makes you THE asshole.", "The myth exists because mothers get custody more than fathers. What it ignores is that many fathers don't file or challenge custody. It's possible it's because they believe they have no chance though so it's a self perpetuating cycle. A lot of US states prefer 50-50 and I think about 90% of custody issues are settled outside a court.", "In my experience, no they do not and it's even doubly more so because my father got custody of us instead of our mother. Now it was an amazing thing that he got custody of us instead of her because she ended up being a drug abuser and birthed several children only to leave them. So I got lucky but my son, my poor baby. I have had him in therapy for the last 5 years and I am happy to say that he is fast recovering from the damage his biological father did. That kid is putting in some amazing work and I couldn't be prouder of having him as my son.\n\nMy ex later told me the reason he fought so hard for custody was because I was a sergeant in the military and it meant he could get really good child support....", "If we knew who she was, her legal fees would be covered in less than 5 minutes.", "Exactly. You made really solid points. I don\u2019t know the exact number, but I think it\u2019s somewhere between 80-90% of the time, when men do file for custody, they get it. The main reason they don\u2019t have custody, is because they don\u2019t ask for it.", ">it meant he could get really good child support....\n\nPeople like this make me wish trial by combat was still a thing."]}
