My boss (38M who i will call Lary) got hired 6 months ago to manage my department that mostly handles customer service and filing, while my dad (50M) manages the other which handles delivery and all the other hands on work.  \n\nThe first few months Lary started working with us, he was pretty okay. He didn't need much training or introduction and was able to do his job pretty well. Cue last month when we got a large project, it was something a bit out of our range of work but Dad said he'd pick up the slack with his team and all we had to do was normal procedure. \n\nWe ended up being swamped with work, I remember most nights my dad and I would stay overnight to make sure things were caught up by the deadline. Now, one of the people on my team, who I'll call Susie, is kind of a doormat. She often lets people push things onto her and does things to please others even when she doesn't have to. \n\ntwo weeks ago Susie came to me crying, saying she was working so much her hair was falling out and she couldn't take it anymore. This shocked me as we all should've had an even workload, save for Lary, who managed on top of his load. Susie then confided in me that Lary had been hitting on her constantly since being hired. Every time she'd turn him down, he'd stack all of his work onto her, threatening he'd have her take the fall for our department not meeting deadlines if she disagreed. \n\nNow this might be there I was TA, \nInstead of going to my dad about this, I went straight Lary. I began berating him, calling him names I can't repeat here. I ended it by calling him a deadweight to the company and a pathetic power-hungry pervert. \n\nMy dad had me take a couple days off as he settled the issue at the company. I thought I did nothing wrong but a couple of my male coworkers said I went too far blowing up at him in front of everyone and my dad said that while he understood my frustration, it wasn't professional for a workplace and I cant act like that again without punishment and now I think I took it too far.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nedit: things I forgot to add\nLarry's files and paperwork were all found at Susie's desk with his name on them. he wasn't smart enough to take his name off of the work he gave to Susie. edit edit: there were texts on her work cell phone between Lary and Susie, Lary inviting her out, asking her for \"favors\" and giving backhanded compliments and getting rejected and pushing until he was left on read, just to try again later. [thank you for pointing out I left this out]\nhe was caught on camera giving his work to Susie, I would say he was clever enough to mix it in with her assignments but he put his work on top of hers so it was clear on the cameras it was his. \nSusie came to me with the laptop full of files with his name and manager locks on them when telling me about Larry's treatment. I didn't just hear it and pop off. jeez.\nalso Lary was fired for stealing from the workplace, blackmailing an employee, and harassing an employee.", "created_utc": 1676194041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110bpea/aita_for_calling_my_manger_a_pathetic_powerhungry/", "score": 1039, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I completely understand wanting to go off on a creep like that, but it wasn't the right way to handle it. In addition to being unprofessional, it put Susie in a bad position by making public knowledge something that perhaps she would have preferred to keep private/just between you two or your dad etc. I think it would be kind to check in with her and offer an apology if needed, even if the actions were well intended.", "NTA \nLarry sounds like a piece of work, her hair was falling out! Susie should have gone to your dad rather than you.\nFollowing this you should have gone to your dad, calling him out in front your work colleagues was not professional. In your colleagues eyes you are difficult to work with now. And you've put your dad in a difficult place because oyh are his daughter. \nIf there is no proof of Larry's pervertedness your dad can't legally fire him. And now you have a boss (Larry) who's employees don't respect or trust him, and finds you difficult to work with, potentially making you the focus of Larry's grossness. And oyuve forced your dad to act and if he can't then more colleagues don't respect him! There is a lot of politics at work here. \nYou are not TA for calling him what he is, but you defo did it in the wrong way", "ESH. What Larry did was wrong. But you did not handle this professionally, appropriately or maturely. Two wrongs don't make a right.

It's very understandable what you did, but I do think you went too far. If the owner of the company wasn't your dad, you might have gotten into a lot of trouble and ultimately done a huge disservice to Susie. You don't say if her name was mentioned when you blew up at Larry, but even if it wasn't, it's likely the whole company now knows what was done to Susie and it doesn't sound like she ever agreed to that. You should have immediately told your dad everything Susie told you and at least given him a chance to handle it.\n\nEdit: Corrected the name", "ESH\n\nIt's not professional to just insult people in front of everyone, regardless of what they did. The main reason for that is that imagine if you happened to be wrong? If any employee comes and tells you a horror story, will you just publicly scream at the potential offender without investigating it and giving them a chance to explain themselves? And doing so exposes the victim too, which they may not want.\n\nI kinda blame your father on this, as the most senior person, who allowed this shit to go on for some time. Yeah he was ignorant of it, but you guys commonly stayed longer to finish things, didn't you notice Susie was working longer hours while noone else did? Noone else noticed anything weird? Don't he hold 1:1 meetings with employees or something?\n\nPS: advise Susie to go to a doctor, because hair falling is commonly associated with thyroid problems, which are quite commonly triggered by stress. It may not be the case, but again, worth a check, the combo \"woman with hair falling during or after high stress situation\" is way too typical.", "YTA, you're obviously not ready for a professional workplace if this is how you handle interpersonal conflict.

Because if he wasn\u2019t your father is a major AH.", "I think if you were anyone other than the boss's daughter you wouldn't have a job at that company anymore. I also think that because you were the boss's daughter there's an implication that you represent the company more than someone who does not have that level of investment. Because of that you screaming at an employee and humiliating them in front of colleagues could be taken by coworkers as representative of the company. It is never appropriate for a supervisor or representative of the company to yell at an employee no matter what they have done. Maintaining a calm tone Gathering all of the information, not just one side, and then taking action is what would normally happen. Typically someone would be written up, given a warning and a plan of action, and then if their behavior did not change they would be fired, but it is never appropriate to yell at an employee or a colleague at work. I think your boss has a larger slice of the ah pie in this situation but you also have a little piece for not being able to conduct yourself in a civil manner.", "I think if you had witnessed him hitting on her/threatening her and had said something in the moment, that would have been understandable.

You are not Larries superior, but your dad is.\n\nthird: these kind of things should be discussed in private with the people involved alone. You can't do this in front of the entire office.\n\nKudos to you for trying to help Susie, but you handled it so wrong that you are TA anyway, and you would have made yourself impossible in any company not owned by your dad.", "[removed]", "YTA.

Absolutely.\nDid he deserve it?   110%!!!!\n\nPeople are saying you should have handled it more quietly or professionally. But like WHY? Who does that protect? Not you. You have no worries about job security. Not your coworker. Your father seems to have done the right thing so I doubt she'd get any professional pushback or retaliation. That just leaves...oh right. the sexual predator. In this situation handling it in a more quiet professional way really only serves to save him from embarrassment (which I think may be why a lot of men think yta for handling it the way you did). But that's the thing, he deserved every bit of shame and embarrassment he felt. He DESERVED to be publically reamed out for his behavior and you happened to be in the perfect situation where you could do that. And you did. And it's awesome. Allowing him to quietly slink away enables him to do it again some other time to some other girl because he knows it will be kept under wraps. He was abusing his power and position to begin with cause he knew that, due to his gender and position, he held more influence than a young woman. You were really the only woman who had the power to break that sense of security for him. And you did. You shattered it by making his disgusting behavior a loud, public, scene that he will never forget or live down. He got fired, you didn't. Hopefully he will never do it again. \n\n\nThere is a reason your coworker came to you. She knows you hold influence due to your position as the founders daughter and felt YOU were a safe option to help her I her time of need. And you really came through for her in the BEST way.

So that not only does that put her in an extremely uncomfortable position where she feels immense pressure to play it down, but it directly plays her power against his? Give him a slap on the wrist and a demotion but have him keep his job and continue to work with the team so that he can continue to make a subtly hostile workplace for Susan AND op? What message does that send out? That response makes it very clear that that working environment values productivity and the comfort of men over the SAFETY of women. \n\nHOW does this make Susan untrustworthy? How does it make OP? What can they no longer trust? This has nothing to do with work ethic or effectiveness. So what is it that they can't trust anymore? That they won't keep sexual misconduct quiet? Good. They SHOULDN\u2019T. \n\nOP is not at fault here. SHE is not to blame. He is. Her response was unprofessional, yes. But his behavior was BEYOND unprofessional. She is not to blame for her father being down one person, that manager is. As soon as he decided to sexually harass his underlings HE created an unsafe work environment and HE put his needs before the efficiency of the team because he was reliant on the \"professionalism\" that protects him from the consequences he rightfully deserves. OP shattered that for him.

Why are you assuming that the coworkers will demonize Susie and not the manager who harrassed her? Who is going to resent OP sticking up for her? Who is she a target to? Not the women who work there that's for sure, women understand that when an older man that is your manager tells you to do something you do not have much wiggle room to resist. Women will understand. And will anyone really *target* her? It didn't go well for the last guy that did. If anything now they know that someone is willing to stand up to that behavior and it will not be tolerated.\n\nYour entire argument is based on speculation of how SOME coworkers *might* feel and a resentment towards OPs privilege. Anyone can go tattle to the boss.

Your father is right that it was unprofessional and if your father hadn't been the boss you'd have been given a warning/written up at the very least and possibly even fired.

He's a jerk, but he would be within his rights to demand you be removed from his team. Going forwards it's going to be more difficult for your dad to deal with him. Hopefully your dad has spoken to Susie and is dealing with this accusation. If she is a doormat she may pedal back when your dad talks to her because you have injected heat into the situation. You have made Lary bullet proof on this issue while hamstringing him as a team leader. When/if he goes, your colleagues will resent you for using daddy as a weapon. \n\nI agree with your anger at Lary, but your actions have made it more difficult for everyone involved.

I get why you lost your shit and it was utterly justified, but as someone else pointed out, it put Susie in an uncomfortable position, as it\u2019s possible that people will connect the dots and now gossip about her. \n\nAnd unfortunately, your dad is right, that\u2019s just not professional. You should have gone to your dad, shown him the proof and then fired Lary in front of everyone else for sexually harassing a coworker, without calling him names, and then badmouthed him to everyone in the same industry and your town.

Suzie will get treated differently.\n\nAs for other women, that is a grand total of one, discounting Suzie and OP. \n\nLeaving 9 men. According to the update, Lary was fired, so 8. \n\nOne of those is OPs dad, the boss that didn't notice sexual harrassment, stealing or blackmail. His idea of punishment for gross misconduct is sending someone home for a few days. Hes also so out of touch that he promised the workload wouldn't change with the new contract but they were \"swamped\" and people were working overnight. Dude bit off more than he can chew and doesn't have a clue. \n\nAnd several of those remaining men were clearly resentful and will now have a heavier workload because Suzie wont be doing Larys anymore so they are down a person.\n\nDon't mistake my opinion of what is VERY likely to happen for something I would do because I'm \"disgusting\" as you and ErdtreeSimp are saying. I've just worked long enough to see it several times.", "Have you ever worked in a large corporate environment? They literally put you thru training annually on how to handle sexual harassment. None of those trainings tell you to publicly blow up at someone with accusations. They all basically say, talk to your manager or HR. You never make accusations publicly. At the point OP blew up, they were just that accusations. The fact that evidence was uncovered is irrelevant. The process should not be outcome based. It should be followed the same way regardless of the actual outcome. That is how you ensure fairness.", "As a fellow nepo baby who works for his dad stop pease for the live of god stop recognise we both got privilege and that anyone else would have been fired", "Other than texts demanding sexual favors? From a manager?", "You may want to re-read the edit there bud.", "Right. The men. \n\n\nSorry but you haven't really changed my mind at all. OP is still NTA. She is not responsible for those men's misplaced feelings. And just because it would be easier for them if the patriarchal rules of capitalism had been upheld doesn't mean that OP did anything morally wrong. They would have gotten the extra workload even if OP had gone about it quietly, so that isn't even close to her fault.  The only difference that OPs actions made to the outcome of the situation is that now they know exactly why. OP never even mentioned Susie's name, so they probably don't know that for sure. And if they were able to guess,  then they likely would have been able to guess in the \"professionally\" correct scenario as well. So again, that changes nothing. \n\nThe only difference that doing it quietly would have made is  saving Larry the embarrassment of having his, yes, incredibly disgusting behavior aired out loudly and publically, (which he deserved). And it would have continued to enable him to do things like this in other workplace environments.\n\nSo basically. If these men in the office resent OP, or worse, Suzie for anything - that is not on OP. That is on them and their willingness to blame the women in the office for making a shitty thing known, rather than blame the man for doing the shitty thing in the first place. That makes them misogynistic, it does not make OP TA.", "I have, and I know.  And yet it often doesn't happen that way. Men end up with a slap on the wrist and women are left to deal with a male coworker that will now hate them and create a subtle hostile work environment. Then the woman quits. It happens all the time.  To the point where my mother gave me advice on how to handle it when I got my first corporate job to \"make sure I can keep the job if something happens\".\n\nThat \"fairness\" is entirely dependent on the bias of the upper management who are often men. They are biased to put themselves in the man's shoes or to prioritize productivity, miney and convenience over the woman. And so the man gets a warning, or a demotion, or a lateral move to another department/schedule changed. Nothing is actually solved. \n\nI KNOW what OP did was unprofessional. It was wildly unprofessional, and would 100% not fly in a larger corporate environment or without ner privilege as the founders daughter. \n\nBut professional courtesy \u2260 moral superiority. The manager was illegally sexually harassing his underling to the point of her breaking down. He fully deserved to be reamed out for it on a personal level, and hopefully the public nature of said verbal thrashing will serve to discourage his inclination to victimize anyone similarly in the future. Keeping shit like that under wraps just protects and enables predators to do it again.
