My boss (38M who i will call Lary) got hired 6 months ago to manage my department that mostly handles customer service and filing, while my dad (50M) manages the other which handles delivery and all the other hands on work.  \n\nThe first few months Lary started working with us, he was pretty okay. He didn't need much training or introduction and was able to do his job pretty well. Cue last month when we got a large project, it was something a bit out of our range of work but Dad said he'd pick up the slack with his team and all we had to do was normal procedure. \n\nWe ended up being swamped with work, I remember most nights my dad and I would stay overnight to make sure things were caught up by the deadline. Now, one of the people on my team, who I'll call Susie, is kind of a doormat. She often lets people push things onto her and does things to please others even when she doesn't have to. \n\ntwo weeks ago Susie came to me crying, saying she was working so much her hair was falling out and she couldn't take it anymore. This shocked me as we all should've had an even workload, save for Lary, who managed on top of his load. Susie then confided in me that Lary had been hitting on her constantly since being hired. Every time she'd turn him down, he'd stack all of his work onto her, threatening he'd have her take the fall for our department not meeting deadlines if she disagreed. \n\nNow this might be there I was TA, \nInstead of going to my dad about this, I went straight Lary. I began berating him, calling him names I can't repeat here. I ended it by calling him a deadweight to the company and a pathetic power-hungry pervert. \n\nMy dad had me take a couple days off as he settled the issue at the company. I thought I did nothing wrong but a couple of my male coworkers said I went too far blowing up at him in front of everyone and my dad said that while he understood my frustration, it wasn't professional for a workplace and I cant act like that again without punishment and now I think I took it too far.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nedit: things I forgot to add\nLarry's files and paperwork were all found at Susie's desk with his name on them. he wasn't smart enough to take his name off of the work he gave to Susie. \nhe was caught on camera giving his work to Susie, I would say he was clever enough to mix it in with her assignments but he put his work on top of hers so it was clear on the cameras it was his. \nSusie came to me with the laptop full of files with his name and manager locks on them when telling me about Larry's treatment. I didn't just hear it and pop off. jeez.", "created_utc": 1676194041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110bpea/aita_for_calling_my_manger_a_pathetic_powerhungry/", "score": 416, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In your colleagues eyes you are difficult to work with now. And you've put your dad in a difficult place because oyh are his daughter. \nIf there is no proof of Larry's pervertedness your dad can't legally fire him. And now you have a boss (Larry) who's employees don't respect or trust him, and finds you difficult to work with, potentially making you the focus of Larry's grossness. And oyuve forced your dad to act and if he can't then more colleagues don't respect him!

The main reason for that is that imagine if you happened to be wrong? If any employee comes and tells you a horror story, will you just publicly scream at the potential offender without investigating it and giving them a chance to explain themselves? And doing so exposes the victim too, which they may not want.\n\nI kinda blame your father on this, as the most senior person, who allowed this shit to go on for some time.

I also think that because you were the boss's daughter there's an implication that you represent the company more than someone who does not have that level of investment. Because of that you screaming at an employee and humiliating them in front of colleagues could be taken by coworkers as representative of the company. It is never appropriate for a supervisor or representative of the company to yell at an employee no matter what they have done. Maintaining a calm tone Gathering all of the information, not just one side, and then taking action is what would normally happen. Typically someone would be written up, given a warning and a plan of action, and then if their behavior did not change they would be fired, but it is never appropriate to yell at an employee or a colleague at work. I think your boss has a larger slice of the ah pie in this situation but you also have a little piece for not being able to conduct yourself in a civil manner.", "I think if you had witnessed him hitting on her/threatening her and had said something in the moment, that would have been understandable.

However, you also need to consider the repercussions of confronting him in front of the whole office, since it could have a negative effect on the company environment.

Absolutely.\nDid he deserve it?   110%!!!!\n\nPeople are saying you should have handled it more quietly or professionally. But like WHY? Who does that protect? Not you. You have no worries about job security. Not your coworker. Your father seems to have done the right thing so I doubt she'd get any professional pushback or retaliation. That just leaves...oh right. the sexual predator. In this situation handling it in a more quiet professional way really only serves to save him from embarrassment (which I think may be why a lot of men think yta for handling it the way you did). But that's the thing, he deserved every bit of shame and embarrassment he felt. He DESERVED to be publically reamed out for his behavior and you happened to be in the perfect situation where you could do that. And you did. And it's awesome. Allowing him to quietly slink away enables him to do it again some other time to some other girl because he knows it will be kept under wraps. He was abusing his power and position to begin with cause he knew that, due to his gender and position, he held more influence than a young woman. You were really the only woman who had the power to break that sense of security for him. And you did. You shattered it by making his disgusting behavior a loud, public, scene that he will never forget or live down. He got fired, you didn't. Hopefully he will never do it again. \n\n\nThere is a reason your coworker came to you. She knows you hold influence due to your position as the founders daughter and felt YOU were a safe option to help her I her time of need. And you really came through for her in the BEST way. You turned the tables and made a situation that was unsafe for her, unsafe for HIM. \n\nNo, you could not reasonably do this in any other workplace environment.  Of course not.

So that not only does that put her in an extremely uncomfortable position where she feels immense pressure to play it down, but it directly plays her power against his? Give him a slap on the wrist and a demotion but have him keep his job and continue to work with the team so that he can continue to make a subtly hostile workplace for Susan AND op? What message does that send out? That response makes it very clear that that working environment values productivity and the comfort of men over the SAFETY of women. \n\nHOW does this make Susan untrustworthy? How does it make OP? What can they no longer trust? This has nothing to do with work ethic or effectiveness. So what is it that they can't trust anymore? That they won't keep sexual misconduct quiet? Good. They SHOULDN\u2019T. \n\nOP is not at fault here. SHE is not to blame. He is. Her response was unprofessional, yes. But his behavior was BEYOND unprofessional. She is not to blame for her father being down one person, that manager is. As soon as he decided to sexually harass his underlings HE created an unsafe work environment and HE put his needs before the efficiency of the team because he was reliant on the \"professionalism\" that protects him from the consequences he rightfully deserves. OP shattered that for him.

Which is why so often women end up getting let go from or leaving jobs where they have experienced sexual harassment.

Why are you assuming that the coworkers will demonize Susie and not the manager who harrassed her? Who is going to resent OP sticking up for her? Who is she a target to? Not the women who work there that's for sure, women understand that when an older man that is your manager tells you to do something you do not have much wiggle room to resist. Women will understand. And will anyone really *target* her? It didn't go well for the last guy that did. If anything now they know that someone is willing to stand up to that behavior and it will not be tolerated.\n\nYour entire argument is based on speculation of how SOME coworkers *might* feel and a resentment towards OPs privilege. Anyone can go tattle to the boss.

OP, you should have reported Lary's behaviour to your father instead of blowing up at him in front of the entire office. Your father is right that it was unprofessional and if your father hadn't been the boss you'd have been given a warning/written up at the very least and possibly even fired.

In the UK you can be fired for 'gross insubordination' and I think calling a manager a pervert in front of his team is a text book example of that charge. I dunno what country you are in, but at the very least you bullied this guy and most places do provide protection against that. He's a jerk, but he would be within his rights to demand you be removed from his team. Going forwards it's going to be more difficult for your dad to deal with him. Hopefully your dad has spoken to Susie and is dealing with this accusation. If she is a doormat she may pedal back when your dad talks to her because you have injected heat into the situation. You have made Lary bullet proof on this issue while hamstringing him as a team leader. When/if he goes, your colleagues will resent you for using daddy as a weapon. \n\nI agree with your anger at Lary, but your actions have made it more difficult for everyone involved.

Your coworkers don't dare to say it out loud, obviously.", "I get what you mean but there's 4 other people excluding myself and Susie.

Even without being able to prove any sexual harassment that\u2019s enough to fire a manager.", "She has Susie's distress, she has the fact that she was visibly  overworked, she has the knowledge that Susie generally keeps to herself and isn't one to share her issues with others. Susie has no motive to lie. That manager does.", "the whole first half before he started shaming me for being a nepo baby lol", "I wasn't fired because my dad said he'd probably do the same in my position and I got put on leave. my sister was fired for spreading rumors around the office before I started working so he's not afraid to fire us like any employee, if anything we are on thinner ice because we are his kids.", "I feel like you guys are just pissed that I'm a \"nepo baby\".", "I forgot I could edit my posts! I will.", "if there wasn't proof I wouldn't have gone off on him.

Such as this case. \n\nThe daughter of the employer accused an employee of sexual harassment. Not of herself but of a 3rd party. WITHOUT any evidence: unfounded accusations at this point. In front of others not involved. She included screaming and name calling. \n\nThe employee can sue the employer for this and would probably win the case *(In the USA)*.

You weren't thinking about the other people in the office who had to overhear this and maybe if individuals in there have gone through sexual harassment and really didn't want to have to listen. You went straight to confrontation, which felt good to you.", "Are you maybe referring to a state law you know about? I haven\u2019t seen that you can sue an employer for lack of due process in firing you on a federal level. I hope it\u2019s true, if it is US employment law will be a lot less depressing for me.", "well he was fired for blackmailing/harassing an employee and stealing from the company so, who knows. it won't hold in court if he tries to sue as he was caught on camera stealing, he was caught on camera taking to Susie by leaning over her where she was clearly uncomfortable, he was caught on camera giving Susie his paperwork, and He wasn't bright enough to take his name off all the work he gave Susie, meaning all the extra work on her computer and in her files had his name on them. she couldn't get any of those without him giving them to her so. :P", "I dont see how this is my issue though. I did what my dad told me by inviting her out of the office so she took breaks but she declined to work through her lunch instead. she was like this way before Lary started working.", "listen I really can't do anything about this as this would be my dad's issue not mine.

If I were the father, I'd consult with a lawyer at this point. He may have to fire his own daughter to cover himself (and only rehire her much later, or once a settlement is reached). And obviously, he'll need to protect the original victim, but at the same time, it may not be as simple as firing the pervert.\n\nHe may have to pay a large lump sum to the pervert, and hope that he takes the deal and leaves in exchange for the money. Either that, or he may have to pay for two wages, and only have one of them show up for work.\n\nHopefully, they can find video evidence, or some other sort of evidence that will corroborate the victim's story, or that the pervert admits some of what he did, because if they can't, and if the pervert denies everything and goes to an employment lawyer, things could end up very badly for the restaurant.\n\nAs a nepobaby, the OP needs to realize, that anything she says and anything she does, could be considered an action of management.", "There are federal guidelines but each state does have their own.
