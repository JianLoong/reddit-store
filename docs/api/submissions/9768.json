Now, one of the people on my team, who I'll call Susie, is kind of a doormat.

You don't want to risk your career on a nasty piece of flop-sweat like \"Lary\". Morally, NTA. Professionally, YTA.", "I want to say NTA because he deserved it but your dad is right. In the workplace you have to go through procedures for this kind of thing, you can't just make judgments on the spot.", "I would say NTA as a human but definitely not professional. I completely understand wanting to go off on a creep like that, but it wasn't the right way to handle it. In addition to being unprofessional, it put Susie in a bad position by making public knowledge something that perhaps she would have preferred to keep private/just between you two or your dad etc. I think it would be kind to check in with her and offer an apology if needed, even if the actions were well intended.", "NTA \nLarry sounds like a piece of work, her hair was falling out! Susie should have gone to your dad rather than you.\nFollowing this you should have gone to your dad, calling him out in front your work colleagues was not professional. In your colleagues eyes you are difficult to work with now. And you've put your dad in a difficult place because oyh are his daughter. \nIf there is no proof of Larry's pervertedness your dad can't legally fire him. And now you have a boss (Larry) who's employees don't respect or trust him, and finds you difficult to work with, potentially making you the focus of Larry's grossness. And oyuve forced your dad to act and if he can't then more colleagues don't respect him! There is a lot of politics at work here. \nYou are not TA for calling him what he is, but you defo did it in the wrong way", "ESH. What Larry did was wrong. But you did not handle this professionally, appropriately or maturely. Two wrongs don't make a right. This type of allegation requires a formal process to gather the evidence and discipline Larry accordingly. You're lucky that such an outburst didn't get your fired.

It's very understandable what you did, but I do think you went too far. If the owner of the company wasn't your dad, you might have gotten into a lot of trouble and ultimately done a huge disservice to Sarah. You don't say if her name was mentioned when you blew up at Larry, but even if it wasn't, it's likely the whole company now knows what was done to Sarah and it doesn't sound like she ever agreed to that. You should have immediately told your dad everything Sarah told you and at least given him a chance to handle it.", "ESH\n\nIt's not professional to just insult people in front of everyone, regardless of what they did. The main reason for that is that imagine if you happened to be wrong? If any employee comes and tells you a horror story, will you just publicly scream at the potential offender without investigating it and giving them a chance to explain themselves? And doing so exposes the victim too, which they may not want.\n\nI kinda blame your father on this, as the most senior person, who allowed this shit to go on for some time. Yeah he was ignorant of it, but you guys commonly stayed longer to finish things, didn't you notice Susie was working longer hours while noone else did? Noone else noticed anything weird? Don't he hold 1:1 meetings with employees or something?\n\nPS: advise Susie to go to a doctor, because hair falling is commonly associated with thyroid problems, which are quite commonly triggered by stress. It may not be the case, but again, worth a check, the combo \"woman with hair falling during or after high stress situation\" is way too typical.", "YTA, you're obviously not ready for a professional workplace if this is how you handle interpersonal conflict. If you weren't a nepo hire you'd be on your ass regardless of how justified you think you were.", "Question - was Larry fired?? Because if he wasn\u2019t your father is a major AH.", "I think if you were anyone other than the boss's daughter you wouldn't have a job at that company anymore. I also think that because you were the boss's daughter there's an implication that you represent the company more than someone who does not have that level of investment. Because of that you screaming at an employee and humiliating them in front of colleagues could be taken by coworkers as representative of the company. It is never appropriate for a supervisor or representative of the company to yell at an employee no matter what they have done. Maintaining a calm tone Gathering all of the information, not just one side, and then taking action is what would normally happen. Typically someone would be written up, given a warning and a plan of action, and then if their behavior did not change they would be fired, but it is never appropriate to yell at an employee or a colleague at work. I think your boss has a larger slice of the ah pie in this situation but you also have a little piece for not being able to conduct yourself in a civil manner.", "I think if you had witnessed him hitting on her/threatening her and had said something in the moment, that would have been understandable. But you really should have spoken with your dad first and/or encouraged Susie to do so with your full support. Between you and Lary I\u2019m going to say ESH, but you only a tiny bit. I hope dad fired him.", "YTA.\n\nMight be unpopular but your nepo privilege is shining hard here.\n\nYou should have gone to your dad about this (or I mean, if you had to hack life on your own should have gone to HR).\n\nNot your place to tell off a manager.

You are not Larries superior, but your dad is.\n\nthird: these kind of things should be discussed in private with the people involved alone. You can't do this in front of the entire office.\n\nKudos to you for trying to help Susie, but you handled it so wrong that you are TA anyway, and you would have made yourself impossible in any company not owned by your dad.", "YTA. You're obviously not ready for a professional workplace if this is how you handle interpersonal conflict. If you weren't a nepo hire you'd be on your ass regardless of how justified you think you were", "YTA. It was wrong of your dad to hire you in the first place, as you obviously have no or very little previous work experience. You heard one side of a story, then took it upon yourself to act very unprofessional. Nepo baby comes to mind...

Absolutely.\nDid he deserve it?   110%!!!!\n\nPeople are saying you should have handled it more quietly or professionally. But like WHY? Who does that protect? Not you. You have no worries about job security. Not your coworker. Your father seems to have done the right thing so I doubt she'd get any professional pushback or retaliation. That just leaves...oh right. the sexual predator. In this situation handling it in a more quiet professional way really only serves to save him from embarrassment (which I think may be why a lot of men think yta for handling it the way you did). But that's the thing, he deserved every bit of shame and embarrassment he felt. He DESERVED to be publically reamed out for his behavior and you happened to be in the perfect situation where you could do that. And you did. And it's awesome. Allowing him to quietly slink away enables him to do it again some other time to some other girl because he knows it will be kept under wraps. He was abusing his power and position to begin with cause he knew that, due to his gender and position, he held more influence than a young woman. You were really the only woman who had the power to break that sense of security for him. And you did. You shattered it by making his disgusting behavior a loud, public, scene that he will never forget or live down. He got fired, you didn't. Hopefully he will never do it again. \n\n\nThere is a reason your coworker came to you. She knows you hold influence due to your position as the founders daughter and felt YOU were a safe option to help her I her time of need. And you really came through for her in the BEST way. You turned the tables and made a situation that was unsafe for her, unsafe for HIM. \n\nNo, you could not reasonably do this in any other workplace environment.  Of course not.

If there is ever a time to utilize that privelege THAT is the time. The girl probably went to her because she knew that OP would understand and weilded some level of influence and could help her, and OP came through. \n\nSure, in any other workplace environment it would be unprofessional and grounds for punishment.

She has worked there for three years (since she was 17) and is responsible enough to stay late with her Dad to ensure deadlines are met. Sounds like someone I would employ. She can learn from her mistakes. Nepo baby? What an insult.", "What? Have a victim try and accuse the MANAGER that sexually  HARRASSED her right to his face in front of her BOSS?  So that not only does that put her in an extremely uncomfortable position where she feels immense pressure to play it down, but it directly plays her power against his? Give him a slap on the wrist and a demotion but have him keep his job and continue to work with the team so that he can continue to make a subtly hostile workplace for Susan AND op? What message does that send out? That response makes it very clear that that working environment values productivity and the comfort of men over the SAFETY of women. \n\nHOW does this make Susan untrustworthy? How does it make OP? What can they no longer trust? This has nothing to do with work ethic or effectiveness. So what is it that they can't trust anymore? That they won't keep sexual misconduct quiet? Good. They SHOULDN\u2019T. \n\nOP is not at fault here. SHE is not to blame. He is. Her response was unprofessional, yes. But his behavior was BEYOND unprofessional. She is not to blame for her father being down one person, that manager is. As soon as he decided to sexually harass his underlings HE created an unsafe work environment and HE put his needs before the efficiency of the team because he was reliant on the \"professionalism\" that protects him from the consequences he rightfully deserves. OP shattered that for him. She is a catalyst but she is NOT the cause.", "So wait, she was also abused before Larry and it was all fine?\n\nTaking the laptop home to work without pay is not ok, and you just said it is the norm for her.

Lunches aren't mandatory and working from home in our department is at will on certain projects, especially for her since she has 2 kids.

Why would they be upset that she isn't getting fired for defending her coworkers against a sexual predator?? It's not like she's missing work, or drinking on the job or...I dont know, harassing her coworkers and shunting all her work onto their shoulders...\n\nWhat kind of person resents someone's ability to stand up to a bully without consequences rather than commend her for taking the bully down? \n\nYes it was unprofessional. Which is why so often women end up getting let go from or leaving jobs where they have experienced sexual harassment. Because our system values \"professionalism\" over safe working environments for women.", "So...just curious. Why are you assuming that the coworkers will demonize Susie and not the manager who harrassed her? Who is going to resent OP sticking up for her? Who is she a target to? Not the women who work there that's for sure, women understand that when an older man that is your manager tells you to do something you do not have much wiggle room to resist. Women will understand. And will anyone really *target* her? It didn't go well for the last guy that did. If anything now they know that someone is willing to stand up to that behavior and it will not be tolerated.\n\nYour entire argument is based on speculation of how SOME coworkers *might* feel and a resentment towards OPs privilege. Anyone can go tattle to the boss.

Its not how normal people behave.", ">Its not how normal people behave.\n\nYour every comment about this situation is totally ignoring the context in which OP berated the manager, which makes it seem like you think it's just fine to sexually harass co-workers but cannot stand women speaking up. You have described her as a girl, her behaviour as histrionics, screaming fits, etc point to some gendered belittling on your part.", "What Lary did was absolutely wrong, but OP was also completely wrong in the way they handled it. OP, you should have reported Lary's behaviour to your father instead of blowing up at him in front of the entire office. Your father is right that it was unprofessional and if your father hadn't been the boss you'd have been given a warning/written up at the very least and possibly even fired.

In the UK you can be fired for 'gross insubordination' and I think calling a manager a pervert in front of his team is a text book example of that charge. I dunno what country you are in, but at the very least you bullied this guy and most places do provide protection against that. He's a jerk, but he would be within his rights to demand you be removed from his team. Going forwards it's going to be more difficult for your dad to deal with him. Hopefully your dad has spoken to Susie and is dealing with this accusation. If she is a doormat she may pedal back when your dad talks to her because you have injected heat into the situation. You have made Lary bullet proof on this issue while hamstringing him as a team leader. When/if he goes, your colleagues will resent you for using daddy as a weapon. \n\nI agree with your anger at Lary, but your actions have made it more difficult for everyone involved.

I really hope that's not the case but if so then OP is an unintentional AH for being the reason Lary gets away with it.", "I understand the flash of outrage.

This could have been the outcome had she talked to her dad and let him intervene. Now, should he be fired, even with an investigation, he can claim workplace harassment and wrongful termination due to the very public blow-up from the bosses daughter. Just because it feels good in the moment doesn't mean it's the best outcome for the long run.

What if Susie hit on him, got turned down, and made it all up to get even? Or applied for the job and is jealous he got it so made this up to discredit him?\n\nOr maybe she is telling the truth.

In most of the US you can be fired for anything that isn\u2019t related to a protected class (race, sex, etc.), and usually you have to show a pattern of discrimination to prove that was the cause. Lary could be fired for wearing a watch. He can certainly be fired for being accused of sexual harassment, or even because OP doesn\u2019t like him. At small startups being fired because people don\u2019t like you is normal  - especially if one of those people is the boss\u2019 kid.", "I mean he can try. But he wasn't fired by OP. Nor was he fired for being blown up at. He was fired for sexual harassment. He can try to sue for workplace harassment but not without exposing what he did in the first place, which just so happens to be a much more egregious case of workplace harassment. He sexually harrassed her, then retaliated and abused his position as her superior when she denied him. That's illegal, what OP did was not. So it would be unwise of him to try to retaliate with any legal action. Either way It seems like he's out of the office, so my guess is Susie does not have to work with him anymore.", "You should really warm up before making those stretches.", "Or the woman lied and Lary can sue.

Ok.", "Sorry kiddo. YTA even if you meant well. In any organization there is a hierarchy or chain of command. Regardless if Lary  deserved it, you were out of line.

You are lucky you work for your father. Did anyone even ask Lary if it was true?  Was it that hair falling out Susie, misread the situation or was pissed off and knew if she talked to you, the daughter of the owner, she may be able to get Lary fired for making her work hard? Or let's say Lary is hitting on her, which is 100% wrong, why do you think it was okay to berate him, is it because you are the owner's daughter? Something to always remember, there are 3 sides to every story.", "Gentle YTA.

Take this opportunity to do so.", "YTA because you had no right to do that and you had  no proof. This is why companies have HR or hire outside mediators to deal with these complaints.

However, it is unprofessional to shout at someone in front of somebody else particularly when you\u2019re the one in the more powerful role with your father owning the company- in the same way as he used his power and abused it you have abused yours.

Not everyone is the same, but your coworker may not have wanted the whole team to know what was going on. Hopefully there\u2019s not a next time, but I would suggest going through proper channels first. This is also a good opportunity to talk with your dad about how to handle something like this.
