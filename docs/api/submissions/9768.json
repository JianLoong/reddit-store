Now, one of the people on my team, who I'll call Susie, is kind of a doormat.

Nope. Was it necessary? No. Is it funny as hell that a pervert got his arse handed to him? Absolutely! \"Lary\" will be thinking twice about pulling that BS again in the office. \n\nFrom now on, make sure to keep an eye on your colleague and tell her to keep a diary of every time he tries to sexually harass her pr force her to do his work as a \"punishment\" for not bowing to his advances. \n\nNext time, you have to go through the proper channels. You don't want to risk your career on a nasty piece of flop-sweat like \"Lary\". Morally, NTA. Professionally, YTA.", "I want to say NTA because he deserved it but your dad is right. In the workplace you have to go through procedures for this kind of thing, you can't just make judgments on the spot.", "I would say NTA as a human but definitely not professional. I completely understand wanting to go off on a creep like that, but it wasn't the right way to handle it. In addition to being unprofessional, it put Susie in a bad position by making public knowledge something that perhaps she would have preferred to keep private/just between you two or your dad etc. I think it would be kind to check in with her and offer an apology if needed, even if the actions were well intended.", "NTA \nLarry sounds like a piece of work, her hair was falling out! Susie should have gone to your dad rather than you.\nFollowing this you should have gone to your dad, calling him out in front your work colleagues was not professional. In your colleagues eyes you are difficult to work with now. And you've put your dad in a difficult place because oyh are his daughter. \nIf there is no proof of Larry's pervertedness your dad can't legally fire him. And now you have a boss (Larry) who's employees don't respect or trust him, and finds you difficult to work with, potentially making you the focus of Larry's grossness. And oyuve forced your dad to act and if he can't then more colleagues don't respect him! There is a lot of politics at work here. \nYou are not TA for calling him what he is, but you defo did it in the wrong way", "ESH. What Larry did was wrong. But you did not handle this professionally, appropriately or maturely. Two wrongs don't make a right. This type of allegation requires a formal process to gather the evidence and discipline Larry accordingly. You're lucky that such an outburst didn't get your fired. If your dad wasn't the boss then you might've been fired.", "ESH\n\nIf daddy wasn't the boss, your ass would be fired", "ESH, larry is abusing his power, and sexually harassing an employee, he can, and should be in deep shit for that, however going off at him, while understandable isn't professional, and can actually hurt the chances of him being properly punished for his actions.\n\nI know why you went off it him and I get it, guy deserved it, but you should have reported him to your dad or another higher up so they could look at all the evidence and deal with him appropriately.\n\nI think, you should take some time to cool off like your dad said, and then come back to work, and view this as a learning experience, you're still young, and dealing with injustice appropriately is unfortunately something that kinda sucks and can involve holding your tongue.\n\nBest of luck", "Soft YTA. It's very understandable what you did, but I do think you went too far. If the owner of the company wasn't your dad, you might have gotten into a lot of trouble and ultimately done a huge disservice to Sarah. You don't say if her name was mentioned when you blew up at Larry, but even if it wasn't, it's likely the whole company now knows what was done to Sarah and it doesn't sound like she ever agreed to that. You should have immediately told your dad everything Sarah told you and at least given him a chance to handle it.", "ESH\n\nIt's not professional to just insult people in front of everyone, regardless of what they did. The main reason for that is that imagine if you happened to be wrong? If any employee comes and tells you a horror story, will you just publicly scream at the potential offender without investigating it and giving them a chance to explain themselves? And doing so exposes the victim too, which they may not want.\n\nI kinda blame your father on this, as the most senior person, who allowed this shit to go on for some time. Yeah he was ignorant of it, but you guys commonly stayed longer to finish things, didn't you notice Susie was working longer hours while noone else did? Noone else noticed anything weird? Don't he hold 1:1 meetings with employees or something?\n\nPS: advise Susie to go to a doctor, because hair falling is commonly associated with thyroid problems, which are quite commonly triggered by stress. It may not be the case, but again, worth a check, the combo \"woman with hair falling during or after high stress situation\" is way too typical.", "YTA, you're obviously not ready for a professional workplace if this is how you handle interpersonal conflict. If you weren't a nepo hire you'd be on your ass regardless of how justified you think you were.", "Question - was Larry fired?? Because if he wasn\u2019t your father is a major AH.", "I think if you were anyone other than the boss's daughter you wouldn't have a job at that company anymore. I also think that because you were the boss's daughter there's an implication that you represent the company more than someone who does not have that level of investment. Because of that you screaming at an employee and humiliating them in front of colleagues could be taken by coworkers as representative of the company. It is never appropriate for a supervisor or representative of the company to yell at an employee no matter what they have done. Maintaining a calm tone Gathering all of the information, not just one side, and then taking action is what would normally happen. Typically someone would be written up, given a warning and a plan of action, and then if their behavior did not change they would be fired, but it is never appropriate to yell at an employee or a colleague at work. I think your boss has a larger slice of the ah pie in this situation but you also have a little piece for not being able to conduct yourself in a civil manner.", "I think if you had witnessed him hitting on her/threatening her and had said something in the moment, that would have been understandable. But you really should have spoken with your dad first and/or encouraged Susie to do so with your full support. Between you and Lary I\u2019m going to say ESH, but you only a tiny bit. I hope dad fired him.", "YTA.\n\nMight be unpopular but your nepo privilege is shining hard here.\n\nYou should have gone to your dad about this (or I mean, if you had to hack life on your own should have gone to HR).\n\nNot your place to tell off a manager. And I guarantee you the only reason you haven\u2019t gotten a written warning or fired is because dad\u2019s the boss man.", "YTA, you acted so unprofessional, and you would never have got away with it if you had not been the boss's daughter.\n\nfirst: you did not witness any of Larries alleged behaviour yourself, you acted on Susies words without investigating first.\n\nsecond: you should have talked to your dad and let him handle it. You are not Larries superior, but your dad is.\n\nthird: these kind of things should be discussed in private with the people involved alone. You can't do this in front of the entire office.\n\nKudos to you for trying to help Susie, but you handled it so wrong that you are TA anyway, and you would have made yourself impossible in any company not owned by your dad.", "YTA. You're obviously not ready for a professional workplace if this is how you handle interpersonal conflict. If you weren't a nepo hire you'd be on your ass regardless of how justified you think you were", "YTA. It was wrong of your dad to hire you in the first place, as you obviously have no or very little previous work experience. You heard one side of a story, then took it upon yourself to act very unprofessional. Nepo baby comes to mind... If you pulled this in the real world, you'd be out faster than you could even say Nepo baby.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, you also need to consider the repercussions of confronting him in front of the whole office, since it could have a negative effect on the company environment. It wouldn't have mattered if you had gone to your dad instead- it's still wrong for your boss to take advantage of someone in such a way!", "As much as I want to give a Jon Bender style cheer over this and throw a party in your honor, you did the right thing in the wrong way.

It is wild to me that people are saying you're an asshole for this. \n\nWas it unprofessional on your part? Yes. \nWould it get you in trouble in any other workplace? Absolutely.\nDid he deserve it?   110%!!!!\n\nPeople are saying you should have handled it more quietly or professionally. But like WHY? Who does that protect? Not you. You have no worries about job security. Not your coworker. Your father seems to have done the right thing so I doubt she'd get any professional pushback or retaliation. That just leaves...oh right. the sexual predator. In this situation handling it in a more quiet professional way really only serves to save him from embarrassment (which I think may be why a lot of men think yta for handling it the way you did). But that's the thing, he deserved every bit of shame and embarrassment he felt. He DESERVED to be publically reamed out for his behavior and you happened to be in the perfect situation where you could do that. And you did. And it's awesome. Allowing him to quietly slink away enables him to do it again some other time to some other girl because he knows it will be kept under wraps. He was abusing his power and position to begin with cause he knew that, due to his gender and position, he held more influence than a young woman. You were really the only woman who had the power to break that sense of security for him. And you did. You shattered it by making his disgusting behavior a loud, public, scene that he will never forget or live down. He got fired, you didn't. Hopefully he will never do it again. \n\n\nThere is a reason your coworker came to you. She knows you hold influence due to your position as the founders daughter and felt YOU were a safe option to help her I her time of need. And you really came through for her in the BEST way. You turned the tables and made a situation that was unsafe for her, unsafe for HIM. \n\nNo, you could not reasonably do this in any other workplace environment.  Of course not. Our system protects predators and you lashing out would not be received well, it would backfired on you and your coworker probably . But in this particular one you held the exact amount of privelege needed to make a difference for that girl and the women in your office and you *DID*.", "The sane thing would have been to call for a meeting and assessing everyone's workloads and deliverables. Take away the power of scheduling from Larry or demote him from manager status. That would have let him know that he's no longer trusted by the management.\n\nAfter that you should have called Larry, Susan and your Dad in a meeting, have Susan accuse Larry in front of your father and state all her grievances. That would have been the time to give him a final warning.\n\nNow you have created a disruptive work environment and your father is one person short on an already difficult project. Your outburst has only escalated the issue and made both Susan, you and Larry untrustworthy by the rest of the team.\n\nI still wouldn't call you the A H since you are young and inexperienced.\n\n#NTA", "I'm going to say NTA. What Lary was doing is horrible, and he deserved to be publicly humiliated.\n\nThat said, next time I would get evidence and then show the evidence in a PowerPoint presentation in addition to yelling. I say this because I am a woman and the amount of times I've been creeped on (or touched inappropriately) in a professional setting is insane, but no one ever believes us unless we have it on video with the perpetrator holding up two forms of government ID.", "NTA. \n\nYou stood up for an abused colleague. You should have gone to the boss, but hopefully your solution worked.", "Her dad is the boss, so she lucked out. Anywhere else she'd be fired. HR exists to protect the company's they work for, and in this case HR is probably OP's dad - and she just made his job really hard by not going through proper channels and humiliating this guy publicly. \n\nHe might be a major creep. This woman might be a massive liar. I'm not saying she is, but those questions have to be asked if a situation is going to be dealt with fairly. \n\nThis kind of thing is usually dealt with quietly and for good reason - a situation like this (even if handled fairly) can devastate workplace morale.", "All of this.", "I didn't mention Susie by name but the only women in the office are myself, Susie, and Paula (fake name). I get what you're saying, I guess I wasn't really thinking about how it'd affect Susie in the aftermath. She's been acting the same as before but it is like her to hide her feelings. I guess I should apologize to her.", "Susie always worked more than others. she hardly took off for lunch and would take her laptop home to work there too. We are all salary and only get overtime if in the office so I didn't think much of it until she came to me.", "I don't know for sure. My dad refuses to fill me in on the situation, but Lary hasn't been in since the incident, so it's likely.", "This is a great use of nepo privelege in my opinion. \n\nIf you can ream someone out for sexual harassment without getting fired I say go for it. If there is ever a time to utilize that privelege THAT is the time. The girl probably went to her because she knew that OP would understand and weilded some level of influence and could help her, and OP came through. \n\nSure, in any other workplace environment it would be unprofessional and grounds for punishment. But she has the privelege in this environment to make a difference and she did. That man deserved every single ounce of the public humiliation he received. Hopefully he will never do it again.", "What you talking about Willis? She has worked there for three years (since she was 17) and is responsible enough to stay late with her Dad to ensure deadlines are met. Sounds like someone I would employ. She can learn from her mistakes. Nepo baby? What an insult.", "What? Have a victim try and accuse the MANAGER that sexually  HARRASSED her right to his face in front of her BOSS?  So that not only does that put her in an extremely uncomfortable position where she feels immense pressure to play it down, but it directly plays her power against his? Give him a slap on the wrist and a demotion but have him keep his job and continue to work with the team so that he can continue to make a subtly hostile workplace for Susan AND op? What message does that send out? That response makes it very clear that that working environment values productivity and the comfort of men over the SAFETY of women. \n\nHOW does this make Susan untrustworthy? How does it make OP? What can they no longer trust? This has nothing to do with work ethic or effectiveness. So what is it that they can't trust anymore? That they won't keep sexual misconduct quiet? Good. They SHOULDN\u2019T. \n\nOP is not at fault here. SHE is not to blame. He is. Her response was unprofessional, yes. But his behavior was BEYOND unprofessional. She is not to blame for her father being down one person, that manager is. As soon as he decided to sexually harass his underlings HE created an unsafe work environment and HE put his needs before the efficiency of the team because he was reliant on the \"professionalism\" that protects him from the consequences he rightfully deserves. OP shattered that for him. She is a catalyst but she is NOT the cause.", "So wait, she was also abused before Larry and it was all fine?\n\nTaking the laptop home to work without pay is not ok, and you just said it is the norm for her. You were basically aware of unpaid overtime and fine with it.", "That\u2019s fine then. In that case I\u2019d agree with your father. The professional thing to do was speak to your dad and have him handle it. If it had been the typical \u201cgood old boys thing\u201d where Larry got a slap in the wrist and they kept him in place, I\u2019d have publicly called him out on it as well.", "She was unproffesional. When the employees see that she can get away with making firing offenses that would cost them the job, they will not be happy. This is not the environment you want in your business.", "No this isn't a good use of nepo-baby privilege.\n\nOP's should have used her unearned clout to run straight to daddy. The boss could have then given Lary the \"public humiliation\" from a position of power, not the unhinged ravings of a daddys girl that is then sent to her room to think about her actions.\n\nOP put a target straight on Suzies back. Now everyone knows about the sexual harrassment, and that she will buckle under and do someones work with a few threats. Those colleagues that think OP went too far will now take it out on Suzie, because OP is basically untouchable. ESH", "Well said", "I completely disagree. If she walked into my office to be hired and I heard that story, the door would be hitting her where the sun don't shine. Extremely entitled and unprofessional. Nepotism at its finest", "actually dad didn't want her doing that, but he couldn't stop her from doing it since it wasn't against policy. Lunches aren't mandatory and working from home in our department is at will on certain projects, especially for her since she has 2 kids. My dad had me start inviting her out to lunch a couple times so she'd take a break but after a few weeks she would decline. So I kinda left her alone.", "Why? Why would they be upset that she isn't getting fired for defending her coworkers against a sexual predator?? It's not like she's missing work, or drinking on the job or...I dont know, harassing her coworkers and shunting all her work onto their shoulders...\n\nWhat kind of person resents someone's ability to stand up to a bully without consequences rather than commend her for taking the bully down? \n\nYes it was unprofessional. Which is why so often women end up getting let go from or leaving jobs where they have experienced sexual harassment. Because our system values \"professionalism\" over safe working environments for women.", "So...just curious. Why are you assuming that the coworkers will demonize Susie and not the manager who harrassed her? Who is going to resent OP sticking up for her? Who is she a target to? Not the women who work there that's for sure, women understand that when an older man that is your manager tells you to do something you do not have much wiggle room to resist. Women will understand. And will anyone really *target* her? It didn't go well for the last guy that did. If anything now they know that someone is willing to stand up to that behavior and it will not be tolerated.\n\nYour entire argument is based on speculation of how SOME coworkers *might* feel and a resentment towards OPs privilege. Anyone can go tattle to the boss. Her outburst, while perhaps somewhat graceless, left NO room for any consequences BUT to let that manager go which in turn created a safer work environment for all the women there. And she was the only person who could guarantee that BECAUSE of her privelege as \"daddy's girl\".", "Your father absolutely could have stopped it. He just didn't want to.", "because It will breed resentment. \"Oh the bosses daughter can yell at managers without issue, but I was late 10 minutes and got a reprimand.\" \"Why can't I yell at a customer who was being rude and condescending, girl was able to have a full on screaming fit at someone on the office floor\" Everything that ever happens at the company now or with this girl will be filtered through this lens.  If you can't understand that, I don't know what to tell you, other than you are not ready for the professional world. One's job is not the place for histrionics.", "Because they would have gotten fired had they done that same thing.", "Lmao I have been working in the professional world for years and  continue to climb. \n\nI would have 0 resentment for this woman and hold only respect for her for doing what I would not be allowed to. That \"lense\" you're referring to is tinted with a shit ton of mysogyny. Because being late to work, and vehemently defending a victim against a sexual predator  are not even CLOSE to the same. lol", "Both are unprofessional actions to take at your career. Just because you think one is right doesn't make it appropriate. If you have a concern about management, bring it up to other managers, not on the floor for everyone to see. I honestly sincerely doubt you have been in the professional world for 10 years if you think its ok to have a full on screaming fit at another employee, and if you think that kind of behavior is anything but a problem. Its not how normal people behave.", ">Its not how normal people behave.\n\nYour every comment about this situation is totally ignoring the context in which OP berated the manager, which makes it seem like you think it's just fine to sexually harass co-workers but cannot stand women speaking up. You have described her as a girl, her behaviour as histrionics, screaming fits, etc point to some gendered belittling on your part."]}
