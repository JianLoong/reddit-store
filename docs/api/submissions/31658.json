Usual take home per in my city is about 350usd/month. We had to get them out as soon as doctor gave approval for hospital discharge.

I covered around 2k out of the total bill.\n\nAce has said he'll pay me back, I agreed to his plan (to let him save face) but realistically I know he would have a hard time to make installments for that since we're having pretty high inflation and baby products have been getting very expensive.

I'm sorry that the result of you being an awesome cousin is you getting harassed.\n\nI'm sure Ace will find some way to pay you back, some time. It may not be in money :)\n\nAvoiding is sometimes the best thing to do.\n\nBut if you *do* get Jay up in your face, you could use that to shut the argument down, maybe?\n- It was just a loan, not a gift - Ace has an agreement to pay me back. - If I loan you money, are *you* going to pay me back? I will want a contract.\n\nAgain, congratulations on being good family."]}
