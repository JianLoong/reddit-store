I'd be thrilled that someone I loved had the opportunity to do something so special and important to them. And only six weeks? That's a major red flag...", "NTA\n\nI don't see how being separated for 6 weeks is such a problem for him. He should support you in this wonderful ambition of yours.\n\nFollow your dream. Have a good hike.", "NTA, it sounds like this is a lifetime dream and if your partner can't support you over a few weeks of missing time, how you can you expect them to support you ever.\n\nGo on your trip and if he can't handle it, break up with him.", "NTA, do it or you will regret it later in life and he will be at fault. Does he really want to be in that position that you didn't take an opportunity in your life because of him?!\nHe is overreacting. People do long distance relationships where they see each other less then once in 2 months. He is being a baby. This is 6 weeks. If he can't handle 6weeks without you, honestly...not sure he is worth keeping as a clingy bf.", "NTA, this is something you've always wanted to do, and it **is** an excellent time in your life to do it.  You have no guarantees that you'll ever get the chance again, and you also have no guarantees that you and your partner won't be broken up 6 months from now over something else. Do it! Take lots of pictures, make lots of memories!", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m older now but a month and a half is not a significant amount of time. Like you\u2019re not going to change wildly as people and fall out of love in a month and a half apart. It\u2019s not a big deal.", "So in the future every time he\u2019s uncomfortable you have to give in? It\u2019s six weeks not months or years. WNBTA and I think you\u2019ll will regret skipping the hike.", "NTA - they might be uncomfortable, but this can be done safely if planned out properly. This is a dream and ambition, your partner should be supporting your dreams and helping you figure out hope to do it. It is ok to express concern, but it is ok to decide to still go.\n\nI am excited for you, this sounds awesome. Good luck friend!!!", "NTA --- And dump the extra weight that you would have to lug around with you on your hiking trip. What is it that makes him so uncomfortable that you're going to be having sex with a different guy every night when you stop for the day or that you might actually meet a decent person that will support and encourage you to follow your dreams?.", "YWNBTA", "NTA - He should be encouraging and supportive of this incredible endeavor. \n\n\nI have the opportunity to travel for 5 weeks in Europe this Summer as I\u2019ll be between roles and my fianc\u00e9 is so happy for me. He actually encouraged me to extend the trip, originally 3 weeks, because when would I get such an extended period of time to travel again? Specially since we would most likely try to start a family in a couple of years. \n\nGo on your hike and enjoy the beautiful nature and self reflection.", "NTA. Carry out your dream, it\u2019s not certain that you\u2019ll ever have chance again. And don\u2019t give up a dream because of someone who might not be in your life in a few years time. If he was a good bf he should support your dream for 6 weeks.", "NTA, 6 weeks is not THAT long. And in a comment you said you'll be able to speak with him since you'll have phone service so it's not a big deal. Dude needs to take a chill pill if 6 weeks is considered \"putting your life and by extension the relationship on the back burner\",  it's just a long holiday. Enjoy.", "NTA\n\nGo. \n\nAlso, break up. He will always hold you back. People who love you support big dreams like walking the the Appalachian Trail. Seriously.", "NAH. Do it for yourself because you'll regret it if you never get to it. He'd be well in his rights to bounce though.", "NAH. You have a dream and a plan to realize it. He has valid concerns about your safety and the impact on your relationship. Good that you discussed your concerns openly. You two may not be compatible and if your relationship can\u2019t survive this, better to know now. Giving up on dreams when you\u2019re young and have the opportunity to realize them is demoralizing. So, you\u2019re not an AH for pursuing a dream. The short term cost may be your relationship while the long term cost of giving up your dream may be regret. In my experience, we tend to regret the things we didn\u2019t do more than the things we did.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s only six weeks - that\u2019s no time at all. It\u2019s something you\u2019ve always wanted to do that you will likely really enjoy. I get that he may miss you while you\u2019re gone, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll miss him, but it\u2019s really weird to me that he he\u2019s kicking up such a stink about a measly six weeks.", "NTA - First, he sounds insecure in the relationship. I would be more concerned over your safety than anything. Sure it would suck to go six weeks without my person but that is their life, I would only try to help them do this.", "NAH, but I don\u2019t think your relationship will survive \u2014 or it will, but with a lot of resentment \u2014 if you don\u2019t find a compromise.", "NTA\n\nBUT and this is a very big BUT, are you willing to sacrifice satisfaction now for satisfaction in the future?\n\nWhat I mean is are you ok jeopardizing your long term relationship for immediate gratification?  You have, in one aspect, the best argument IMO, and you support something I have ALWAYS taught my children, never live life looking over your shoulder.  You dont want to be years from now wondering \"what if\" on something you wanted years ago. But you shoot down your argument with one line, \n\n> I don\u2019t like the idea of this dream of mine being disrupted by someone else\u2019s discomfort\n\nThe fact of the matter is, your dream is just that YOURS.  If you were single then this would be a no brainer.  But, you now have another and to make a claim like you did seems callous to me.  \n\nI can tell you this, you WILL be damaging your relationship, hell you may be ending it.  I get the perception you are telling your partner that although I have feelings for you, although I may want to spend my life with you and/or although you bring me joy, I dont respect your opinion.  \n\nThe only out on this, and I mean the ONLY out, is if you have been talking about this trip to him for years, since the day you two met.  So that he knows this is a life long ambition, you have wanted this forever.  In this case, well he knew what he signed up for, and although he may have at first thought, well this aint gonna happen. Over years, you have kept talking about it and he slowly shifted to, I hope this is a phase that she will drop over time. To now, maybe I can convince her not to do this for me.\n\nDepending on what scenario you fall into, you BOTH have a tough call to make.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your hiking is a deal breaker for him then you are not as compatable as you had hoped. Good couples need to suport each others dreams and goals.\n\nBTW... I hope you have an awesome trip...I am jealous. Im sure you know, but he can join for parts of the hike, or at least  meet you in certain spots.", "NTA, but if you\u2019re hiking alone, please consider bringing someone else. Seriously. Crazy world out there.", "NTA. If he can't wait six weeks for you so you can have your lifelong dream, the relationship is not worth keeping. I am somewhat sympathetic to people who don't think they can handle a long-distance relationship for months or years, but I guess this guy just needs a warm body, and if you're gone for a week, he'll find a new one.", "NTA. Six weeks is a very short amount of time. He\u2019s blowing this wildly out of proportion.", "NTA. I walked the whole damn thing a few years ago and that involved resigning from my job as well as getting the okay from my partner. She was very upset and worried but saw that I had become obsessed with this great white whale and so ended up being very supportive. Luckily for me my workplace offered to hold my post open for me and on my return I found that I slotted right back into normal life.\n\nThis might be very different for you. I met a lot of younger people (many fresh graduates) who were obviously still learning about themselves and who they wanted to be through the hike. Some of them just found happiness out there and wanted to keep on walking, some realised that there were things back home that they had been running away from and now needed to change, some discovered that they were stronger and more braver and more willing to take risks than they had ever suspected.\n\nTaking six weeks away is nothing; the changes it might make to you and your relationship is what you need to be considering and discussing.", "I, and most of my friends, took the opportunity to travel after graduation.  Our trips varied between 3 months and two years. This is a perfectly normal thing to do.  \n\nSix weeks is nothing in a long term relationship and the blink of an eye in a lifetime. Don't be held back by his attitude. If he's prepared to stomp on your dream then he's not the guy for you. \n\nNTA and have a wonderful time.", "NTA. You\u2019ll probably never have another opportunity to do this again!", "YTA you cant put your  relationship  down for a few weeks and pick it  back up lol  unless you want someone  else to take  care of it while you gone and they might not even  give it back\ud83e\udd23 im sorry the way you put it was hilarious  to me but you either need to consider  his feelings  too or leave the relationship. \nEdit wait I have a question  within these 6 weeks  will you have cell service  or be able to speak  him at  all?", "Not just they had the opportunity but followed through.  How many people have dreams and they go no where?  I love hearing stories like this, I dont care if it was I always wanted a bakery to I wanted to sail the Atlantic.", "This \u261d\ufe0f", "It\u2019s funny, because my friend and her fianc\u00e9 hiked the Appalachian trail. When they joined up with another small group, the fianc\u00e9 started behaving like a jealous toddler and rage quit the hike. My friend is now married to one of the guys from the other group.", "Honestly, if a six week trip cost her the relationship, the relationship was not worth having to begin with. She still going to be able to call from time to time as she'll have service.", "Yes, I would have cell service and be able to speak to him/check in with him. Whether I\u2019m the asshole or not, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to suggest he\u2019d be justified in cheating on me just because I am not physically present for a period of time.", "6 weeks is a blink of an eye looking back at your life. Don't waste a good opportunity to do something you've always dreamed of.", "Call?  From the Trail?  LOL, obviously you have NEVER been to the Appalachian Trail.  There are \"designated spots\" along the way but cell service is spotty at best.  As for the relationship not worth having, that is a call for them to make, not you.", "That didn't  justify  him cheating  on you it justify him having  the right to leave  you because  he decides  he doesn't  want to put his relationship  on hiatus  until  you ready to come back and pick it up again  cheating  is wrong  no matter which way you look at it."]}
