{"id": 5167, "submission_id": "zq6xpw", "title": "AITA for sitting in a first class seat becuase someone shat next to me?", "selftext": " \n\nWhere I live trains are usually 70% normal seats and 30% first class. The trains sometimes have these little cabins, rooms with 8 rooms, other times its just normal layouts. I was on the one with the cabins and the normal seats were almost entirely filled, first class was half empty. I was in the cabin and the guy sitting next to me was really drunk. Unfortunately in my country people are often drunk on the trains and the railway police have to get them off. This drunk guy shits and pisses himself. People in teh cabin moved over but I was still stuck next to him. I walked up and down the train and I couldn't find any spots that were empty. I found one evnetually and when I sat down the people next to that spot told me they don't want me sitting there. Fucking great.\n\nI went over to first class and sat down and the ticket checker asks me why I'm here and I explained the situation. She said she didn't care and I had to sit in my assigned seat or another seat in that section. I asked if i could just pay extra for the first class ticket, expecting it to be just the difference but no she was going to charge me 250% the price of the original first class ticket as thats the fee when you buy on the train. This was some bullshit c\u043evid measure thats still in effect. I told her no I'm not going to pay such a ridiculous amount to just not be next to someone who shat himself. She leaves and comes abck with another ticket checker. We get into a massive argument and they threaten to get the railway police involved. Other people chime in and say they're being fucking ridiculous. I heard her calling the railway police so I just got off at the next stop.

Total bs.", "NTA.  The train policy has already gotten sufficient attention, but how about calling out the AH passengers that \"didn't want\" OP sitting somewhere.  Who TF are they to decide that?  Was the seat taken?", "NTA. I can't believe that. Like, you literally can't keep people sitting next to that. You even tried to sit elsewhere in the same class and the people told you no. Just train staff unwilling to do anything for you. You could ask the organization if they support people sitting next to others under those circumstances because I guarantee you they do not.", "NTA.

Nobody should expect you to remain sitting next to some guy who shat himself\n2. You were an idiot for just claiming a seat in first class\n3. What you should have done is gone to find the ticket inspector on the train, and said \"this guy shat himself - please find me a seat that isn't shitty\". They would probably have escorted you to the spot that you found, but the people sitting there told you to leave. If the ticket inspector had seated you there, those people would have shut up and accepted it.\n\nYTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
