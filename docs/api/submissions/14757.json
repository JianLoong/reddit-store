{"id": 14757, "submission_id": "12ls76v", "title": "AITA for not allowing my friend to invite her bf on a group holiday after he \"complimented\" me?", "selftext": "I (28F) have a friend, Lucy, also 28. We've been friends for around 5 years and she's been dating her bf Harvey for just over a year. Harvey has given me a bad vibe from day 1. I find him abrasive and overbearing, and while I realise everyone's relationship is different, his idea of what is appropriate to say about his relationship in company really rubs me the wrong way. All of our mutual friends have recognised these things about Harvey, but we all tolerate him for Lucy's sake, and he has formed friendships with some of our bfs.\n\nI organised a group holiday in June, and invited our core friend group + partners. I am paying for the travel and accommodation for everyone. \n\nLast week, a few of us went out for drinks. The conversation turned to exercise and I made a joke about how I force myself to go to pilates so that I can maintain my figure for my bf. Harvey then said something to the effect of me being a \"dream woman\" and he wished Lucy would make the effort for him and that I should invite her to pilates with me. He also made an absolutely vile comment about how \"flexible\" I must be. Everyone at our table looked shocked that he would say something like that, except Lucy who just looked embarrassed. I told Harvey that that was an extremely rude and creepy thing to say, but he doubled down and said that he hadn't insulted me and that I should stop being so uptight.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I felt upset by what Harvey said, and the less I felt comfortable with seeing him in future and especially with him coming on the trip. I don't like him, but now I feel like I'll have to hyperconscious of his behaviour. It might be a slight overreaction and maybe he didn't mean anything by it but now even when I think of him I just feel slimy. My bf said I shouldn't have to have someone staying with me that creeps me out and ultimately I agreed, so I called Lucy and said I would really prefer if Harvey didn't come on the trip in light of the way he'd behaved when I last saw him.\n\nLucy said I was overreacting to what Harvey said, it was a compliment, and in any case it was just the alcohol talking. She said if he didn't go she wouldn't be able to go either and that I just wanted excuse to exclude him because I'd never liked him and was always judging him. I wasn't budging and once she realised, she hung up. She has now gone and told everyone in the group that I won't allow him to come and it's split the group pretty evenly. Some of our friends think it's fair that I don't want him there since I am paying for the trip, while others think it's a bit heavy handed since it will mean Lucy can't go on the trip either and if she's not offended by what he said I shouldn't be either. My boyfriend is really not keen on Harvey coming because they don't have the best relationship but says if it's that important that Lucy comes then I should probably just give in.", "created_utc": 1681467139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ls76v/aita_for_not_allowing_my_friend_to_invite_her_bf/", "score": 622, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your money your choice.\n\nSounds like Lucy is in an abusive relationship.", "NTA. \n\nNever apologize for cutting a creep out of your life. If Lucy wants to go with him, that\u2019s her prerogative. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t a compliment and even Lucy knows it. Gross.", "NTA,\n\n>My bf said I shouldn't have to have someone staying with me that creeps me out and ultimately I agreed\n\nYour BF is correct especially since you are paying. Idk why Lucy is still with him, but she wants to support him. Let her.", "NTA.\n\nas soon as you said \"I am paying for the travel and accommodation for everyone\" then why would you he's clearly not your friend and it your dam holiday. \n\nOP I hope you and your friends have a amazing holiday and get Lucy a holiday romance while your at it.", "NTA. His comment wasn\u2019t inappropriate only because Lucy was there. If he\u2019d been a single dude that would have been just as bad in a different way.  He said that to *you*.  This is not just about Lucy being jealous or embarrassed. Can\u2019t believe your friends are all \u201cLucy has forgiven him (shrug)\u201d\n\nHe sounds awful. He\u2019s a menace to any woman around him.  I wouldn\u2019t invite him anywhere.  If Lucy wants to die on that hill let her.", "Stick to your gut the guy is garbage.", "NTA.\n\nIt's pretty clear things will be very uncomfortable with Harvey around  on the trip and sharing an accommodation with him. And since you're paying for everything it's not like Lucy paid for him to be there.", "NTA. You are doing your best to discourage this behaviour but its not getting better AND you are paying for the trip so you are in position to choose if he comes or not.  \n\n\nBTW whats the thing with one person paying for the whole group trip? Ive seen this here multiple times, is that a thing in the US? Im from the EU and we don't do that at all.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to pay for the vacation of someone you actively don't trust.\n\nIt might do you some good to have a private, in person sit-down with Lucy where you really hash it out with Lucy, and you explain what Harvey does that freaks you out so much. \n\nBecause as far as Lucy is concerned, you're not doing this out of a fear for your own safety or anything like that, you're reneging on a promise all because of a drunken foot-in-mouth situation. Lucy thinks you're being a dick to her boyfriend \"just because you don't like him\", and she might be more understanding if she realizes this is continuous, uncomfortable feeling of his repeated actions and character. \n\nLucy doesn't understand the why. Talking and laying things out for her plainly might change that. \n\nOf course, it might not. Truth of the matter is when someone is used to \"protecting\" someone they care about they'll have a million different shields in place to defend that person, and this can often lead to anyone who calls out their attitude as being an enemy (trust me, I say this from personal experience). \n\nGood luck.", "NTA...but this will likely kill your friendship in the short-term. Group trips are always tricky, but there's no way you should have to pay for someone like this.", "NTA. A few things here:\n\n- Harvey should, at the very least, apologize to you for what he said. Alcohol or not, that was incredibly inappropriate. If everyone is shocked, that's saying something.\n\n- No amount of alcohol is an excuse to say anything like this about anyone, whether that's your own partner or someone else - even worse knowing you have a bf.\n\n- You are the one paying for this trip, so it's ultimately up to you to decide who does and doesn't get to go with you.\n\n- If Lucy doesn't see anything wrong with what her partner has said about one of her friends (she should be grossed out and berate him, instead of defending him). Her *not* being upset by what her bf told you, doesn't mean you can't/shouldn't be.\n\n- The fact that your friend, Lucy, is trying to set up the whole group of friends against you, is very telling. Instead of trying to talk to you like an adult, she just acts toxic.\n\nIt sucks that the friend group is now on the fence about whether to pick your or Lucy's side, even though it seems most of them don't like Harvey and his behaviour. This could possibly ruin your trip with them, especially if you bring those who'd rather pick Lucy's side. In any case, I'm sorry this happened to you, and I hope you will find a way to maybe have this fixed. Perhaps ask Lucy to have a one on one talk?", "NTA\n\nNeither you nor Lucy should be putting up with this shit. That\u2019s not a compliment at all, it\u2019s fucking vomitous and gross. Lucy needs to understand this isn\u2019t ok, you are 100% correct in my books.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to pay the way for someone who makes you that uncomfortable; and his comments really are disturbing. It's unfortunate that Lucy will feel for now like she has to decline, but keep in mind for the future that you may want to remind her that *she's* part of the group and it's the bf's behavior that's isolating him.", "NOPE. NTA. If you give in now, he will be meaner and creepier on the trip to make a point. You're paying for this. Lucy can date a creep all she wants, the consequence of her bringing a creep into your friendgroup is that she doesn't get a free vacation.", "NTA, I knew a guy like Harvey and was told by his girlfriend that I was over reacting and hysterical as well, I wasn\u2019t. Trust your gut, the guy is a creep.", "Harvey gives me a vibe of a sexual assaulter \n\nI think you should keep your distance away from him, NTA", "Absolutely NTA. This guy said something completely rude and objectifying. And still expects to go on an all expense paid trip by you?? Frankly I\u2019m surprised that any of your friends are sticking by him. Stand your ground OP", "NTA. Don't budge, Harvey sounds like a slimeball and given the way she's backing him up I would distance myself from Lucy too.", "NTA\n\nYou get to react to those comments for yourself, that's your boundaries to define and uphold, not Lucy's.", "NTA. You're allowed to invite and disinvite anyone for any reason. The things Harvey said made you incredibly uncomfortable, so I think it's fair to disinvite him, especially when you're paying for everything. It's just really sad and unfortunate you might have lose a friend due to all that, but please don't give in.", "NTA\n\nYou're paying their way. You decide who goes.", "NTA inviting Harvey just because of being sorry for Lucy is enabling his abusive behavior", "NTA You could bring the people you want to come. You don't have to pay for that creep. After all, you don't want to spend a holiday of relaxation feeling uncomfortable. If Lucy doesn't want to come it's her loss. After all that comment was directed to both you and her.", "NTA - of course, first of all he sounds creep and Lucy is defending him and 2) you are paying expenses ? Your choice! But it might be you will be loosing a friend soon (Lucy). But I think not for too long, as I hope she sees this is unacceptable behaviour for a partner towards a friend. (and breaks the relationship). If it would be me - i would extend an invitation to Lucy but not to him and woulmd be very clear and sincere in why.   Even your BF agrees!", "NTA\nAnd please talk to Lucy. This sounds like she is in a very toxic, mentally abusive relationship and Harvey is making her think you are in the wrong. He could easily apologize to you. He could easily make the decision and tell Lucy to just go on the trip without him. But he doesn't. And her feeling the need to defend his inappropriate behaviour and blaming you, making your friends go against you, although you are paying for a vacation for them?? Absolute red flag!", ">if she's not offended by what he said I shouldn't be either.\n\nWhat?!  Of course she wasn't offended!  She's not the one being \"complimented\" by the creepy guy!  \n\nIt might be time to count her out as a friend until she opens her eyes.  NTA.", "NTA You shouldn't have to pay for someone who makes you uncomfortable to go on a trip. He's failed the vibe test on multiple occasions from what you have said.", "If that was a work place his comment would've constituted sexual harassment. Because it is.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are paying for the trip, and at no time should you feel obligated to have someone who makes you feel uncomfortable to that level in your personal space. Harvey sounds like a creep, and I would 100% exclude him from this trip. \n\nOne side note though, don't work out to \"keep your figure for your bf\". Do it because it makes YOU happy. :)", "NTA. Choices - including who we choose to date, come with consequences, and a consequence to your friend is that if she chooses to date a creep who makes people uncomfortable, those people won\u2019t want him around anymore, and if she insists on being around him all the time then they won\u2019t have her around either.\n\nIt would be worth talking to her about his behaviour in more depth if you can though, because as rude and as obnoxious as it was to you, it was also deeply disrespectful to her that he was speaking about another woman in that way, and it sounds like she might not be valuing herself enough to set boundaries and demand respect from him - which leaves her vulnerable to unhappiness and even abuse within her relationship. So if you can help her see that you care about her and think she deserves better, you\u2019d be being a good friend to her.", "\"If she's not offended by what he said I shouldn't be either\" really slapped me in the face because the comment was about you! Who cares if she didn't admit that it offended her, it offended YOU and you're the one paying for the trip and rightfully get to say who can come and who can't. Stick to your decision and don't allow him to come because that will only make him feel that he can say anything and get away with it.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a bizarre comment to make to your partners friend, and highly inappropriate and I would not be comfortable either.\n\nBesides, you\u2019re paying. You have the freedom to invite who you want to.", "NTA. Make it clear that Lucy is still invited. If she\u2019s not comfortable going, that\u2019s a her problem. \n\nAs far as Harvey\u2026 good for you!!! I\u2019m so sick of us tiptoeing around rude obnoxious men in the name of keeping the peace. I\u2019m so sick of men who make gross comments and then tell you they were just joking. Let\u2019s normalize calling them out and ostracizing them!!!! There\u2019s absolutely no reason why you should be subjected to him on holiday, *especially* if you\u2019re paying.", "NTA - he sounds like a creep and honestly like he would take advantage if he could. You're paying for the trip, and it's not like Lucy can't still come. Stick to your decision. If you have a gut feeling about this guy, you're probably right", "INFO why can Lucy not go if Harvey doesn't go?", "NTA, you're paying for the trip, you choose who goes, simple.", "If you was all paying your own way then YTA, because you\u2019re paying it gives you that power to call the shots. If it was me I\u2019d let the guy come on the trip. Just sounds like banter to me.", "The problem is that, you can't give all your friends a +1 except Lucy. By excluding her boyfriend, you are also excluding her.\n\nBasically, you are giving Lucy an ultimatum, that she can only be your friend if she breaks up with her bf.\n\nThere are better ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he\u2019s comfortable saying that stuff in public, he is probably comfortable saying things behind closed doors, too. The fact that she feels the need to make excuses for his behavior like \u201che was too drunk\u201d is indicative of deeper problems. Try to be patient with her; remember that she is not the problem, she is the victim, and ultimately she is your friend. Maybe try to explain the deeper reasoning behind why you are uncomfortable rather than focusing on his actions. Ultimately, if she still doesn\u2019t understand, remember that it is your money and you are absolutely not entitled to pay for someone with whom you are uncomfortable. That is a boundary, not a punishment, and is perfectly valid. Lucy\u2019s choice not to go is her own. Definitely not TA for that.", "NTA sounds like Lucy is in an abusive relationship.

You are paying and made a choice about who you wanted to bring, and she made a choice about if she wants to attend.\n\nI agree with other folks who have suggested you have a one-on-one chat with her; it sounds like she\u2019s on a path to isolating herself because she has a bad partner, and that\u2019s just going to dig her into a deeper relationship bad hole.", "NTA. Why do people think Lucy\u2019s comfort takes priority over yours? I would not have a misogynist creep who makes me deeply uncomfortable around me period, let alone on an isolated holiday getaway. ALWAYS TRUST YOUR GUT FRIENDS. \n\nI would have a conversation face to face with Lucy about why this makes you uncomfortable, and why you will not be changing your mind. You can let her know that she is free to join by herself. \n\nHowever, it sounds like this guy is toxic and controlling. I would suggest looking up some resources to ask her some questions about how she is feeling in this relationship, and to perhaps point out some of the ways you see it affecting and changing her. Some of the resources about supporting people on abusive relationships might be helpful. Not focusing on his jerkiness, because she will get defensive, but centering the conversation around who she is, how she feels, and what you think she deserves. I would venture that there is some insecurity that Lucy has that makes her vulnerable to this sort if she is not seeing past this guy\u2019s false bravado, and is unable to kick him to the curb. I\u2019d be willing to be there was a big dose of love bombing at the beginning of this relationship. \n\nTry to let her know that she has a friend/safe non-judgemental space in you when she hopefully realizes she deserves better.

I would just like to clear the air. I am not willing to spend time with or money on people who make me uncomfortable and who insult my friends. Therefore, I am not going to be talked into letting Harvey come on the trip with us. If Lucy chooses to bow out as well, that\u2019s her decision.

Well done for cutting him out.", "Yeah those comments are shocking", "I'm surprised the boyfriend isn't more upset.", "I\u2019m from the EU as well, it just depends on the friend group. In this instance I rented the house because I\u2019m staying on after as well and would be there anyway so I didn\u2019t feel the need to ask anyone to chip in. But on other occasion when we\u2019ve planned something together we\u2019ve split it. Or sometimes someone will have an idea and just go ahead and organise it. I think it just depends on the group dynamic", "In the US it\u2019s usually someone just puts the full payment on a credit card and everyone pays their portion of the trip back to them. I don\u2019t know anyone who pays in full for travel and accommodations for their friends.", "I think this might be a too generous take on Lucy. I think she fully understands why OP doesn't want to be around this guy. BUT, if she acknowledges that out loud, then she will eventually have to acknowledge that these aren't one-off behaviors and that her boyfriend is actually just a creep. And she likes him enough where she doesn't want to have to do that. She's relying on OP sweeping this kind of thing under the rug to not rock the boat so that she doesn't have to reevaluate her relationship. \n\nIt's much easier to just say, \"OP is a judgemental asshole who doesn't understand him/our relationship,\" than \"my boyfriend is the kind of guy to not only objectify my friends in front of me but to compare me unfavorably to them.\"", "I\u2019m not really too fussed about the people taking Lucy\u2019s side because I know it\u2019s not because they think what Harvey said was okay. It\u2019s more they feel like isolating Lucy when she is with someone like Harvey is unfair. I do see their point because Lucy is normally a really sweet person, I do think her reaction to this is because Harvey will not have taken it well. So again, I know they\u2019re not defending Harvey. Just at the same time, my bf is not going to be there for the whole trip and I just don\u2019t feel right about Harvey after what he said.", "It's a bizarre (and gross) comment to make to *anyone*.", "Harvey will make an issue of it. Since they e been together I\u2019ve only seen her out without him if he\u2019s been away for some reason.

You never see her without him unless he\u2019s out of town", "Being Harvey\u2019s dream woman might not be an insult but trust me it feels insulting \ud83d\ude02.\n\nAnd yes, it was sexually charged, unless his wiggling eyebrows is a nervous tic. Which again, if we were friends and had built that rapport, no problem, but he\u2019s been warned about these comments numerous times and doesn\u2019t seem to understand that we are not at the level where he can talk to me like that and it doesn\u2019t feel really gross. \n\nI didn\u2019t really want to say Lucy should be more offended than she is because really that\u2019s up to her. My bf would have been missing a limb or two if he\u2019d said that about me but Lucy has to manage her own feelings about it, so it felt a bit unfair to comment.", "I'm betting control but I'm hoping that's just my pessimism talking", "Eh, the whole in vino veritas thing is somewhat overblown. People absolutely do and say things that are completely counter to themselves while drunk. While sober, I am not a fan of construction equipment, but while drunk, I have definitely taken parking cones home with me and cried because \"they're just so beautiful and orange.\" Sexual harassment, however, is not in that category of \"objectively ridiculous alcohol-induced behavior.\"", "And what\u2019s the likelihood of him being drunk on a vacation, pretty high, so they can just expect more of the same behavior.", "You might not be wrong, but someone so brazen as to say those things, defend them, and have his GF defend him too likely exerts some fort of control. Thats like 8th percentile humanity right there", "Openly slagging your partner, comparing her to her friend, and making inappropriate comments about both of their bodies... \nThat is emotional abuse. \n\nAnd that's what he's willing to say in front of people.  \n\nWhat do you think is happening at home?", "I also feel some concern about the language Lucy used here. She said that since he isn't allowed on the trip that she CAN'T come, and not that she WON'T. I find that a little sus.", "He went out of his way to disrespect her infront of other people. And as of now this is essentially leading to her being excluded from the trip, and that's a hallmark of abusive relationships too.", "This is a tactic abusers use. My ex used to do the same thing to me. This is a warning sign. If he\u2019s saying that in public, what is he saying to her in private?", "Chrinic and flagrant disrespect is indeed emotional abuse", "Plus the fact that Lucy can't come either if Harvey can't is kind of concerning without more details. Why can't she come? Is it because he won't let her?", "What I dont understand is why Lucy says she can't go without him. It's not like she's splitting accommodation and travel expenses with him, so she can't afford to go alone. It sounds to me like he's controlling, and thats worrisome.", "Have you made it clear to the friend group that Lucy is still invited to come, and it\u2019s her choice to stand by Harvey?  You\u2019re not excluding her. She\u2019s excluding herself at Harvey\u2019s defense.", "I completely disagree with Happy-Viper. I can see how, if that dynamic existed between you, the joke about \"perfect woman\" and wishing his GF did that could be tongue and cheek but it is very delivery and dynamic dependent. You've been clear that this is not the first instance and that he has made yourself and others uncomfortable before so clearly that dynamic does not exist and the delivery is not banter. \n\nThe comment about flexibility is just plain inappropriate. I like to think that I'm no prude with my sense of humour and have quite a dark streak to it and I would NEVER make that joke to one of my friends significant others. Especially infront of them. \n\nFor me what you said about exercise was relating to your motivation being derived form wanting to be attractive for your partner (a completely normal motivator). What Harvey did was quite meanly throw it as his GF and then openly joke about how flexible you'd be to sleep with. For me, those comments exist on completely different levels. Yours being acceptable, his first being mean to his GF and a bit weird but probably acceptable under certain conditions of familiarity and dynamic which DONT exist here and his last one being wildly unacceptable.", "You made a joke about your body, and it's attractiveness.\n\nHe did the same, keeping with your exact energy.\n\n>If he and I had been friends okay fine but we aren\u2019t.\n\nSee this is the point, Lucy's entirely right. You just want to exclude this dude because you don't like him, it's not about the comments.\n\nYou're all in the same friend group. The issue wasn't what he said, you wouldn't have made a deal about it if others in the group had said it. You just don't like Harvey, and are massively overreacting to his comments, compared to if the others said the same comments.\n\nBut, again, your money, your choice. Unless, just to be clear, by \"You're paying for it\", you don't mean \"You're putting it down on your card, but getting paid back for it.\"", "This makes it even worse. He has been warned, multiple times, about being inappropriate and continues. So it's not an isolated drunken foot in mouth one off is it? Its a pattern of making women in your friendship group feel uncomfortable.", "Yeah it's not a man's job to \"defend his woman's honor\". \n\nHe was clearly like \"wtf\" and is supporting his GF as he should", "Eh, it\u2019s not really uncommon for insecure people in love to put up with more than they should.", "Yeah, there\u2019s a lot going on here. None of it is good.", "Unless I misread something, he never slagged on his partner. He said OP should invite her to Pilates, which while again, has a disrespectful implication, it\u2019s hardly abusive. He complimented OP and made a comment saying he would want a woman like her, which is disrespectful, but no evidence of abuse. Just be careful not to conflate \u201cdude is an AH\u201d with \u201cdude is abusive\u201d.", "That also could just be OP\u2019s writing. It\u2019s hardly fair to judge third hand info and a Reddit post to decide what goes on behind closed doors.", "Fam, you\u2019re reaching REAL hard here. He wasn\u2019t TRYING to isolate her, OP just isn\u2019t comfortable around a creep.", "Yeah, crying is also a tactic abusers use too, but in isolation, with no other evidence you really shouldn\u2019t be calling anything that MIGHT be abuse a definitive sign of abuse.", "Eh, going on a vacation that your SO was uninvited from is pretty well a guaranteed relationship ender.\n\nThere doesn't have to be any control exerted and Lucy is likely just standing with her BF.", "They don\u2019t really go places alone. Since they\u2019ve been together I\u2019ve seen her without him like 3 times, because he was away. They\u2019re normally glued at the hip. But I also understand why if your bf is banned from a trip you might not want to go.", "Yeah they know that. But we all know Lucy won\u2019t come without Harvey. Since they\u2019ve got together I\u2019ve seen her without him like 3 times.", "THANK YOU. That\u2019s what I was trying to say, not as articulately as you lol. \n\nI\u2019d like to add, it was a complete joke about me going to Pilates for my boyfriend. I laughed while I said it, so for Harvey to take that and use it to say something about Lucy felt like he was just looking for an opportunity to say something derogatory so desperately he took that joke seriously.", "You\u2019re right, I don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s been told numerous times to stop making sexual comments about people, and he never learns. Mind you, I think saying what he said in the company of his gf is pretty vile even if we were close but again, he\u2019s been told by me, by my bf, and by another friend\u2019s bf to knock it off with the pervy crap and he never has so yes based on his patterns of behaviour I don\u2019t like him. \n\nAlso, in my opinion, me making a comment about myself is not an invitation for anyone to make sexual comments about me. Me saying \u201cI think I look pretty tonight\u201d is not an invitation for a man to say \u201cyeah I\u2019d like to f*ck you\u201d because it is absolutely *not* the same energy.", "Lucy is the one jeopardizing the friendship by standing by the creep rather than her friend. Stop blaming OP for Lucy\u2019s poor decisions.", "> There are other ways to intervene, which are more supportive of Lucy.\n\nAre you talking about intervening on the relationship in general?\n\nCos the holidays kinda binary. If the BF comes, they're gonna have a bad time. If he don't, Lucy's gonna be stuck at home.", "> There are other ways to intervene, which are more supportive of Lucy.\n\nAnd those are...", "Can you explain the joke?", "I agree. That\u2019s definitely a stupid joke one of my friends would make. I mean she started it with a joke of needing to look good for her man and then maybe he just took it a step too far for her. But honestly that comment wouldn\u2019t even register on my radar. But different friend groups have different boundaries", ">Yeah it's not a man's job to \"defend his woman's honor\".\n\nUnless she wants/asks him to, and vice-versa. If your partner doesn't have your back, you need a new partner.", "Just as its not uncommon for abusive partners to put down their partners in front of people", ">and he wished Lucy would make the effort for him and that I should invite her to pilates with me.\n\nIn a group setting, he compared her unfavorably to her own friend. Saying she wasn't as attractive and wasn't willing to put in the effort to be more attractive *for him.*", "I'm not saying it is, merely that it's worth the OP's consideration. I know I personally am very deliberate in choosing can't/won't", "Harvey? Is that you?", "Well she shouldn't be. It's entirely possible that the reason she's standing with him is that she's scared of him. Now that's not a guaranteed and you could be right but that kind of speaks to a lot of other people's points that she can't admit that what he said to OP is not appropriate because if she does then she has acknowledge all the other things she's been ignoring.", "I get the \"I don't wanna do a vacation without my so\"-part... on the other hand please look into the last part of horror-commission565's comment. It really sounds worrisome that she only can go out alone when Harvey is gone.", "Ugh. How exhausting. I\u2019d be making some available spaces in my friend group after this, especially after giving them a free vacation. \n\nNot saying that paying for a vacation entitles you to hold anyone\u2019s friendship hostage, but seriously, if I had a friend that was paying for my vacation and they felt they had to exclude a creep, I\u2019d be wholly supportive of whatever decision they made.", "You just straight up don\u2019t like this dude, which is fine. It\u2019s pointless to nitpick the exact language of what was said", "But even if it wasent a joke and you seriously derive motivation for exercise from wanting to look good for your partner its YOUR statement. It is saying that it makes you feel good to look good in your partners eyes which is not inherrently sexually charged. Even if you do make it a sexually charged joke its YOURS you get to do that about your body and relationship. He does not! For him to take that and make it about sexually objectifying you based on percieved flexibility is inapprorpriate. It is menacing as between male and female there is a clear power and safety dynamic difference. It takes the ownership of your statement, joke or otherwise, away from you and turns you from the autonomous individual making a comment or joke about themselves, kind of at your and your relationships own expense, into the joke being his sexual objectification of you for everyone else to laugh at. The fact that you say people around the table did not appreciate it should validate your stance. I hope one of the other men called him out on it. \n\nOne of my biggest red flags in a person is when they think humour has to be at the expense of someone in any way but especially by causing them discomfort. I concede that dynamics exist where people banter and joke at each other. The key is that these interactions are only funny when both parties find them funny. What Harvey did was firstly, joke meanly at the expense of Lucy infront of others, then try to find humour in implying you'd be flexible to fuck?! Those are both not only not funny but also well below the standard I would expect from an adult his age. \n\nYour comments make it clear you do NOT have a dynamic with him where that would be acceptable and that he has been told that his interactions have fallen short of what people consider acceptable in the past. Ergo he is either uncaring to other peoples views or unable to control himself. Either which would personally be sufficient for me, as a man in his 30s, to want nothing to do with him. \n\nIt's not really about liking or not linking him. It sounds like you don't like him and you should be wary that this might make you react more harshly towards him. However, the interaction as described, I obviously only have your description to go off OP, makes me feel like you're right to dislike him and that this was another instance of a line being crossed.", ">He\u2019s been told numerous times to stop making sexual comments about people, and he never learns.\n\nNow that seems pretty circular.\n\nYou say you don't like him for his comments, but also, it'd be fine if the people you do like had made those comments?\n\nThat doesn't make sense, it's contradictory.\n\n>Mind you, I think saying what he said in the company of his gf is pretty vile even if we were close\n\nWhat? It'd be both \"pretty vile\", but also \"okay fine?\" How does that make sense?\n\nOh, also, just to clarify since I didn't straight-up ask, you're not getting reimbursed by the group, right? Like, you're paying for everyone's accomodation, end of story, right? It's not that it's going on your card and you're getting paid back by them?", "Honestly there isn\u2019t one that\u2019s funny.", "Do people not make sex jokes with their friends? I have two sets of friend groups and both we joke about sex stuff.", "Well that\u2019s how I read the situation too but from the responses I can see how viewing comments like that is enabling the behaviour. We learn. I know so many men who are like that so to me it\u2019s never been of concern or something I\u2019d get upset by. You\u2019re right though different people different boundaries.", ">Well she shouldn't be\n\nI mean sure but people in relationships have a hard time seeing red flags. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> It's entirely possible that the reason she's standing with him is that she's scared of him\n\nSure but there's no indication that this is the case. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrankly, I think she's just ignoring red flags and \"oh he just says weird things when he's drunk or he just has a weird sense of humour\". She's not in a position to see that this isn't a \"just drunk\" thing,.", "I disagree. Language is important and choice of language is important. Making sexually charged jokes about someone and finding their discomfort funny is not really acceptable from anyone let alone an adult man towards a woman. I think in a group setting joking about your GFs friends flexibility in terms of how she might utilise this sexually is inappropriate. You would, as an adult, be very clear if you had a dynamic with someone where you could make this a joke. OP says that Harvey has been warned by multiple people, multiple times in her comments, that some of what he says makes people uncomfortable. This should be sufficient to just not behave that way. Cutting him out is entirely acceptable and goes beyond \"I just don't like him\".\n\nObviously we need to be concious that this is OPs version of events. But as with every post on this sub, we get the version we are given and have to debate with the assumption that this holds close to an objective narrative.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s contradictory to say you have different boundaries with different people.

It's circular reasoning.\n\n>No, I\u2019m not being reimbursed.\n\nOh, completely fair, you can do as you please with it 100% then.", "Yeah you\u2019re completely right, I\u2019m just going off what I read I was not at the table so can\u2019t form a valid opinion on what it was.", "Oh perfectly and eloquently said.", "No one\u2019s confused here, nothing is going to stop men from sexualising us no matter how hard we try, OP said she felt uncomfortable and told him it was inappropriate I\u2019m sure that made him feel embarrassed and rightly so, hopefully he won\u2019t do it again.", "I agree he needs to adjust his behaviour, clearly it was a comment that wasn\u2019t funny nor taken well and I also agree we are focusing on the wrong comment here and the wrong person entirely.", "Just directly replying to your completely unnecessary statement that you were trying to explain how \u2018banter\u2019 can be taken both ways. \nNo one ever needs that, thanks. Exactly zero people are confused here, so no explanations caping for sexual harassers are needed. \n\nAlso, your comments reveal some strong tendencies towards internalized misogyny. \n\nYou may not be aware but from an outside perspective, your downvotes make a lot more sense when you consider that after listening to the way they justify their shit for so long that we start to sound like the misogyny is coming from inside the house.", "Thankfully he won\u2019t have an opportunity to do so again on the trip."]}
