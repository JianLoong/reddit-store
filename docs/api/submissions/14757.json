{"id": 14757, "submission_id": "12ls76v", "title": "AITA for not allowing my friend to invite her bf on a group holiday after he \"complimented\" me?", "selftext": "I (28F) have a friend, Lucy, also 28. We've been friends for around 5 years and she's been dating her bf Harvey for just over a year. Harvey has given me a bad vibe from day 1. I find him abrasive and overbearing, and while I realise everyone's relationship is different, his idea of what is appropriate to say about his relationship in company really rubs me the wrong way. All of our mutual friends have recognised these things about Harvey, but we all tolerate him for Lucy's sake, and he has formed friendships with some of our bfs.\n\nI organised a group holiday in June, and invited our core friend group + partners. I am paying for the travel and accommodation for everyone. \n\nLast week, a few of us went out for drinks. The conversation turned to exercise and I made a joke about how I force myself to go to pilates so that I can maintain my figure for my bf. Harvey then said something to the effect of me being a \"dream woman\" and he wished Lucy would make the effort for him and that I should invite her to pilates with me. He also made an absolutely vile comment about how \"flexible\" I must be. Everyone at our table looked shocked that he would say something like that, except Lucy who just looked embarrassed. I told Harvey that that was an extremely rude and creepy thing to say, but he doubled down and said that he hadn't insulted me and that I should stop being so uptight.\n\nThe more I thought about it, the more I felt upset by what Harvey said, and the less I felt comfortable with seeing him in future and especially with him coming on the trip. I don't like him, but now I feel like I'll have to hyperconscious of his behaviour. It might be a slight overreaction and maybe he didn't mean anything by it but now even when I think of him I just feel slimy. My bf said I shouldn't have to have someone staying with me that creeps me out and ultimately I agreed, so I called Lucy and said I would really prefer if Harvey didn't come on the trip in light of the way he'd behaved when I last saw him.\n\nLucy said I was overreacting to what Harvey said, it was a compliment, and in any case it was just the alcohol talking. She said if he didn't go she wouldn't be able to go either and that I just wanted excuse to exclude him because I'd never liked him and was always judging him. I wasn't budging and once she realised, she hung up. She has now gone and told everyone in the group that I won't allow him to come and it's split the group pretty evenly. Some of our friends think it's fair that I don't want him there since I am paying for the trip, while others think it's a bit heavy handed since it will mean Lucy can't go on the trip either and if she's not offended by what he said I shouldn't be either. My boyfriend is really not keen on Harvey coming because they don't have the best relationship but says if it's that important that Lucy comes then I should probably just give in.", "created_utc": 1681467139, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ls76v/aita_for_not_allowing_my_friend_to_invite_her_bf/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your money your choice.\n\nSounds like Lucy is in an abusive relationship.", "NTA. \n\nNever apologize for cutting a creep out of your life. If Lucy wants to go with him, that\u2019s her prerogative. \n\nThat wasn\u2019t a compliment and even Lucy knows it. Gross.", "NTA,\n\n>My bf said I shouldn't have to have someone staying with me that creeps me out and ultimately I agreed\n\nYour BF is correct especially since you are paying. Idk why Lucy is still with him, but she wants to support him. Let her.", "NTA.\n\nas soon as you said \"I am paying for the travel and accommodation for everyone\" then why would you he's clearly not your friend and it your dam holiday. \n\nOP I hope you and your friends have a amazing holiday and get Lucy a holiday romance while your at it.", "NTA. His comment wasn\u2019t inappropriate only because Lucy was there. If he\u2019d been a single dude that would have been just as bad in a different way.  He said that to *you*.  This is not just about Lucy being jealous or embarrassed. Can\u2019t believe your friends are all \u201cLucy has forgiven him (shrug)\u201d\n\nHe sounds awful. He\u2019s a menace to any woman around him.  I wouldn\u2019t invite him anywhere.  If Lucy wants to die on that hill let her.", "Stick to your gut the guy is garbage.", "NTA.\n\nIt's pretty clear things will be very uncomfortable with Harvey around  on the trip and sharing an accommodation with him. And since you're paying for everything it's not like Lucy paid for him to be there.", "NTA. You are doing your best to discourage this behaviour but its not getting better AND you are paying for the trip so you are in position to choose if he comes or not.  \n\n\nBTW whats the thing with one person paying for the whole group trip? Ive seen this here multiple times, is that a thing in the US? Im from the EU and we don't do that at all.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to pay for the vacation of someone you actively don't trust.\n\nIt might do you some good to have a private, in person sit-down with Lucy where you really hash it out with Lucy, and you explain what Harvey does that freaks you out so much. \n\nBecause as far as Lucy is concerned, you're not doing this out of a fear for your own safety or anything like that, you're reneging on a promise all because of a drunken foot-in-mouth situation. Lucy thinks you're being a dick to her boyfriend \"just because you don't like him\", and she might be more understanding if she realizes this is continuous, uncomfortable feeling of his repeated actions and character. \n\nLucy doesn't understand the why. Talking and laying things out for her plainly might change that. \n\nOf course, it might not. Truth of the matter is when someone is used to \"protecting\" someone they care about they'll have a million different shields in place to defend that person, and this can often lead to anyone who calls out their attitude as being an enemy (trust me, I say this from personal experience). \n\nGood luck.", "NTA...but this will likely kill your friendship in the short-term. Group trips are always tricky, but there's no way you should have to pay for someone like this.", "NTA. A few things here:\n\n- Harvey should, at the very least, apologize to you for what he said. Alcohol or not, that was incredibly inappropriate. If everyone is shocked, that's saying something.\n\n- No amount of alcohol is an excuse to say anything like this about anyone, whether that's your own partner or someone else - even worse knowing you have a bf.\n\n- You are the one paying for this trip, so it's ultimately up to you to decide who does and doesn't get to go with you.\n\n- If Lucy doesn't see anything wrong with what her partner has said about one of her friends (she should be grossed out and berate him, instead of defending him). Her *not* being upset by what her bf told you, doesn't mean you can't/shouldn't be.\n\n- The fact that your friend, Lucy, is trying to set up the whole group of friends against you, is very telling. Instead of trying to talk to you like an adult, she just acts toxic.\n\nIt sucks that the friend group is now on the fence about whether to pick your or Lucy's side, even though it seems most of them don't like Harvey and his behaviour. This could possibly ruin your trip with them, especially if you bring those who'd rather pick Lucy's side. In any case, I'm sorry this happened to you, and I hope you will find a way to maybe have this fixed. Perhaps ask Lucy to have a one on one talk?", "NTA\n\nNeither you nor Lucy should be putting up with this shit. That\u2019s not a compliment at all, it\u2019s fucking vomitous and gross. Lucy needs to understand this isn\u2019t ok, you are 100% correct in my books.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to pay the way for someone who makes you that uncomfortable; and his comments really are disturbing. It's unfortunate that Lucy will feel for now like she has to decline, but keep in mind for the future that you may want to remind her that *she's* part of the group and it's the bf's behavior that's isolating him.", "NOPE. NTA. If you give in now, he will be meaner and creepier on the trip to make a point. You're paying for this. Lucy can date a creep all she wants, the consequence of her bringing a creep into your friendgroup is that she doesn't get a free vacation.", "NTA, I knew a guy like Harvey and was told by his girlfriend that I was over reacting and hysterical as well, I wasn\u2019t. Trust your gut, the guy is a creep.", "Harvey gives me a vibe of a sexual assaulter \n\nI think you should keep your distance away from him, NTA", "Absolutely NTA. This guy said something completely rude and objectifying. And still expects to go on an all expense paid trip by you?? Frankly I\u2019m surprised that any of your friends are sticking by him. Stand your ground OP", "NTA. Don't budge, Harvey sounds like a slimeball and given the way she's backing him up I would distance myself from Lucy too.", "NTA\n\nYou get to react to those comments for yourself, that's your boundaries to define and uphold, not Lucy's.", "NTA. You're allowed to invite and disinvite anyone for any reason. The things Harvey said made you incredibly uncomfortable, so I think it's fair to disinvite him, especially when you're paying for everything. It's just really sad and unfortunate you might have lose a friend due to all that, but please don't give in.", "NTA\n\nYou're paying their way. You decide who goes.", "NTA inviting Harvey just because of being sorry for Lucy is enabling his abusive behavior", "NTA You could bring the people you want to come. You don't have to pay for that creep. After all, you don't want to spend a holiday of relaxation feeling uncomfortable. If Lucy doesn't want to come it's her loss. After all that comment was directed to both you and her.", "NTA - of course, first of all he sounds creep and Lucy is defending him and 2) you are paying expenses ? Your choice! But it might be you will be loosing a friend soon (Lucy). But I think not for too long, as I hope she sees this is unacceptable behaviour for a partner towards a friend. (and breaks the relationship). If it would be me - i would extend an invitation to Lucy but not to him and woulmd be very clear and sincere in why.   Even your BF agrees!", "NTA\nAnd please talk to Lucy. This sounds like she is in a very toxic, mentally abusive relationship and Harvey is making her think you are in the wrong. He could easily apologize to you. He could easily make the decision and tell Lucy to just go on the trip without him. But he doesn't. And her feeling the need to defend his inappropriate behaviour and blaming you, making your friends go against you, although you are paying for a vacation for them?? Absolute red flag!", ">if she's not offended by what he said I shouldn't be either.\n\nWhat?!  Of course she wasn't offended!  She's not the one being \"complimented\" by the creepy guy!  \n\nIt might be time to count her out as a friend until she opens her eyes.  NTA.", "NTA You shouldn't have to pay for someone who makes you uncomfortable to go on a trip. He's failed the vibe test on multiple occasions from what you have said.", "If that was a work place his comment would've constituted sexual harassment. Because it is.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are paying for the trip, and at no time should you feel obligated to have someone who makes you feel uncomfortable to that level in your personal space. Harvey sounds like a creep, and I would 100% exclude him from this trip. \n\nOne side note though, don't work out to \"keep your figure for your bf\". Do it because it makes YOU happy. :)", "NTA. Choices - including who we choose to date, come with consequences, and a consequence to your friend is that if she chooses to date a creep who makes people uncomfortable, those people won\u2019t want him around anymore, and if she insists on being around him all the time then they won\u2019t have her around either.\n\nIt would be worth talking to her about his behaviour in more depth if you can though, because as rude and as obnoxious as it was to you, it was also deeply disrespectful to her that he was speaking about another woman in that way, and it sounds like she might not be valuing herself enough to set boundaries and demand respect from him - which leaves her vulnerable to unhappiness and even abuse within her relationship. So if you can help her see that you care about her and think she deserves better, you\u2019d be being a good friend to her.", "\"If she's not offended by what he said I shouldn't be either\" really slapped me in the face because the comment was about you! Who cares if she didn't admit that it offended her, it offended YOU and you're the one paying for the trip and rightfully get to say who can come and who can't. Stick to your decision and don't allow him to come because that will only make him feel that he can say anything and get away with it.", "NTA. \n\nThat\u2019s a bizarre comment to make to your partners friend, and highly inappropriate and I would not be comfortable either.\n\nBesides, you\u2019re paying. You have the freedom to invite who you want to.", "NTA. Make it clear that Lucy is still invited. If she\u2019s not comfortable going, that\u2019s a her problem. \n\nAs far as Harvey\u2026 good for you!!! I\u2019m so sick of us tiptoeing around rude obnoxious men in the name of keeping the peace. I\u2019m so sick of men who make gross comments and then tell you they were just joking. Let\u2019s normalize calling them out and ostracizing them!!!! There\u2019s absolutely no reason why you should be subjected to him on holiday, *especially* if you\u2019re paying.", "NTA - he sounds like a creep and honestly like he would take advantage if he could. You're paying for the trip, and it's not like Lucy can't still come. Stick to your decision. If you have a gut feeling about this guy, you're probably right", "INFO why can Lucy not go if Harvey doesn't go?", "NTA, you're paying for the trip, you choose who goes, simple.", "If you was all paying your own way then YTA, because you\u2019re paying it gives you that power to call the shots. If it was me I\u2019d let the guy come on the trip. Just sounds like banter to me.", "The problem is that, you can't give all your friends a +1 except Lucy. By excluding her boyfriend, you are also excluding her.\n\nBasically, you are giving Lucy an ultimatum, that she can only be your friend if she breaks up with her bf.\n\nThere are better ways.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he\u2019s comfortable saying that stuff in public, he is probably comfortable saying things behind closed doors, too. The fact that she feels the need to make excuses for his behavior like \u201che was too drunk\u201d is indicative of deeper problems. Try to be patient with her; remember that she is not the problem, she is the victim, and ultimately she is your friend. Maybe try to explain the deeper reasoning behind why you are uncomfortable rather than focusing on his actions. Ultimately, if she still doesn\u2019t understand, remember that it is your money and you are absolutely not entitled to pay for someone with whom you are uncomfortable. That is a boundary, not a punishment, and is perfectly valid. Lucy\u2019s choice not to go is her own. Definitely not TA for that.", "NTA sounds like Lucy is in an abusive relationship.

You are paying and made a choice about who you wanted to bring, and she made a choice about if she wants to attend.\n\nI agree with other folks who have suggested you have a one-on-one chat with her; it sounds like she\u2019s on a path to isolating herself because she has a bad partner, and that\u2019s just going to dig her into a deeper relationship bad hole.", "NTA. Why do people think Lucy\u2019s comfort takes priority over yours? I would not have a misogynist creep who makes me deeply uncomfortable around me period, let alone on an isolated holiday getaway. ALWAYS TRUST YOUR GUT FRIENDS. \n\nI would have a conversation face to face with Lucy about why this makes you uncomfortable, and why you will not be changing your mind. You can let her know that she is free to join by herself. \n\nHowever, it sounds like this guy is toxic and controlling. I would suggest looking up some resources to ask her some questions about how she is feeling in this relationship, and to perhaps point out some of the ways you see it affecting and changing her. Some of the resources about supporting people on abusive relationships might be helpful. Not focusing on his jerkiness, because she will get defensive, but centering the conversation around who she is, how she feels, and what you think she deserves. I would venture that there is some insecurity that Lucy has that makes her vulnerable to this sort if she is not seeing past this guy\u2019s false bravado, and is unable to kick him to the curb. I\u2019d be willing to be there was a big dose of love bombing at the beginning of this relationship. \n\nTry to let her know that she has a friend/safe non-judgemental space in you when she hopefully realizes she deserves better.

I would just like to clear the air. I am not willing to spend time with or money on people who make me uncomfortable and who insult my friends. Therefore, I am not going to be talked into letting Harvey come on the trip with us. If Lucy chooses to bow out as well, that\u2019s her decision.

Well done for cutting him out.", "Yeah those comments are shocking", "I'm surprised the boyfriend isn't more upset.", "I\u2019m from the EU as well, it just depends on the friend group. In this instance I rented the house because I\u2019m staying on after as well and would be there anyway so I didn\u2019t feel the need to ask anyone to chip in. But on other occasion when we\u2019ve planned something together we\u2019ve split it. Or sometimes someone will have an idea and just go ahead and organise it. I think it just depends on the group dynamic", "In the US it\u2019s usually someone just puts the full payment on a credit card and everyone pays their portion of the trip back to them. I don\u2019t know anyone who pays in full for travel and accommodations for their friends.", "I think this might be a too generous take on Lucy. I think she fully understands why OP doesn't want to be around this guy. BUT, if she acknowledges that out loud, then she will eventually have to acknowledge that these aren't one-off behaviors and that her boyfriend is actually just a creep. And she likes him enough where she doesn't want to have to do that. She's relying on OP sweeping this kind of thing under the rug to not rock the boat so that she doesn't have to reevaluate her relationship. \n\nIt's much easier to just say, \"OP is a judgemental asshole who doesn't understand him/our relationship,\" than \"my boyfriend is the kind of guy to not only objectify my friends in front of me but to compare me unfavorably to them.\"", "I\u2019m not really too fussed about the people taking Lucy\u2019s side because I know it\u2019s not because they think what Harvey said was okay. It\u2019s more they feel like isolating Lucy when she is with someone like Harvey is unfair. I do see their point because Lucy is normally a really sweet person, I do think her reaction to this is because Harvey will not have taken it well. So again, I know they\u2019re not defending Harvey. Just at the same time, my bf is not going to be there for the whole trip and I just don\u2019t feel right about Harvey after what he said.", "It's a bizarre (and gross) comment to make to *anyone*.", "Harvey will make an issue of it. Since they e been together I\u2019ve only seen her out without him if he\u2019s been away for some reason.
