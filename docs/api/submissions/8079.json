I\u2019ve been friends with Anna ( fake name) since we were in kindergarten and we even went to the same college. After college we moved into a nice 1br apartment together to save money. As we grew and got our funds together we invested in a 3 bedroom and 2 bath house that we renovated together. We have lived there together for 5 years now. \n\n4 Years ago I met my husband and we instantly clicked. After a few weeks he met Anna and over the 2 years we dated, we all hung out several times together. He proposed and we ended up talking about our future. Rob ( fake name) wanted us to move in together but I didn\u2019t want to move out of my house into an apartment and he couldn\u2019t afford to make the investment in a house together. I talked to Anna and Rob moved in with us a couple months after. \n\nAfter we got married he talked to me about how my friendship with Anna made him deeply uncomfortable. I\u2019m very close with Anna and there are no filters when we talk together. We have sleepovers sometimes and go out on little \u201cdates\u201d but that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always been.   Rob has never previously voiced discomfort with how we are despite knowing us for 4 years. I think he only is doing this because I recently told him how Anna confessed her love for me when we first bought the house together. I got angry when he said this and told him this is what he signed up for and if he had a problem with it then he should\u2019ve told me years ago. \n\n\nI love my husband deeply but I\u2019m not willing to get rid of Anna just because he\u2019s insecure. We have been distant for a few days and I feel I shouldn\u2019t have been blunt but it\u2019s the truth.  I don\u2019t know what to say and I\u2019m starting to feel bad. I think I might be the asshole due to how he\u2019s reacting.", "created_utc": 1674494307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jhsdt/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_knew_what_he_was/", "score": 3600, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He did NOT have all the information going into the marriage. You waited till after you were married to give him this information. It changes the dynamic entirely. \n\nYTA. Of course he's insecure. You've been living with someone who loves you for 5 years and just told him about it. He did not know what he was signing up for.", "Are you leading TWO people on? \ud83e\udd14", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you marry Anna? You have a deep commitment with her but honestly, marrying your now husband was kinda a low blow. \n\nYou\u2019re not giving either of them the full relationship with you that they both desire and that is just insanely selfish. Pick one.", "**YTA**\n\nYTA for the simple fact that your statement in the heading here is objectively untrue: your husband DID NOT in fact \"know what he was getting into\" because you were deliberately untruthful with him until recently. \n\nYou portrayed \"what he was getting into\" as you marrying him while having an admittedly unusual but still platonic close friendship with Anna. But that wasn't true. Anna has confessed to you that you love her, and you have continued to have \"sleepovers\" and \"dates\" with her after decades of sharing your lives together and even creating a shared household. So let's call this what it is: while your relationship may not be *sexual* per se, Anna has been openly \"playing house\" with you in a de facto romantic relationship parallel to your marriage. \n\nIn other words, what your husband \"got himself into\" was a de facto polyamorous relationship that he never consented nor agreed to. \n\nAnd you can argue about that, but that doesn't change what it is. Romantic relationships do not have to be sexual. Ask any asexual person who is part of a deeply loving, committed couple.\n\nSo yes, YTA. You didn't have the right to commit your husband to polyamory without explaining to him that Anna wasn't just your best friend, she was in love with you and you had every intention of continuing to occasionally share a bed with her (sexually or not), go on \"dates\" with her, and in every meaningful way allow her to feel that she is having a relationship with you that apparently satisfies her romantic needs. That was a conversation that needed to happen BEFORE marriage.", "YTA\n\nHe didn't know. \"I recently told him...\"\n\nHe though you had a close friend that lived with you. Now you have an unrequited love that lives with you. He obviously feels uncomfortable because this isn't what he was expecting and now you're being dismissive of his concerns.\n\nGoing on \"dates\" with a platonic friend isn't a big deal. Going on \"dates\" with someone who wants to be more than friends sounds a lot like cheating.", "I was on the fence until the part where you told Rob *after* you two got married, and decided to live as a married couple with Anna, that she\u2019s actually in love with you. So no, he didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what he was signing up for. YTA", "YTA she confessed she loves you are you aren't taking a step back... wtf\n\nAt least stop going on \"dates\"", "Wait, what -- you have sleepovers when you live in the same house? What does that look like?", "YTA. \n\nI do wonder if he\u2019s actually asking you to cut off Anna or rather just alter your life where it\u2019s centered between you & him, rather than You & Anna, but sometimes him. Once you\u2019re married, the only person who should ever feel like they are playing third wheel is your best friend. Why is your best friend ok with you making your husband the third wheel? \n\nWhy do you call your hang out time with your platonic best friend \u201clittle dates\u201d? You say she confessed her love for you & that it\u2019s fine, but are you sure you don\u2019t need to create boundaries with your friend? It would be pretty hard for me as a friend to get over my \u201clove\u201d for you if every time we hung out you referred to it as dates.   How often do you and your husband go on \u201clittle dates\u201d?\n\nHe\u2019s communicating & expressing his concern that he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s more important than your best friend. You married him. He\u2019s your chosen family. It sucks to be in a position where you have to prioritize your husband over your best friend, but that should be a no brainer. It\u2019s not one or the other, or at least it shouldn\u2019t be. Prioritize your husband. Move into a house or an apartment with just him. Maybe Anna would be willing to rent out your space in your home, therefore giving you & your husband more disposable income to invest in a future together. Make time with Anna outside of that. \n\nIf you\u2019re unwilling to prioritize your marriage over anyone else, then maybe you married the wrong person in this game of third wheels.", ">I think he only is doing this because I recently told him how Anna confessed her love for me when we first bought the house together. I got angry when he said this and told him this is what he signed up for and if he had a problem with it then he should\u2019ve told me years ago. \n\nHow could he tell you he had a problem with this years ago, if you only recently disclosed that Anna liked you more than a friend? Seems like you weren't really transparent about things. That makes the living arrangement, which was already out of the ordinary, more questionable. I would think being married and in your late 30s would be a good spot to reevaluate how long we plan on roommating with the childhood best friend. I don't think I agree with ending the friendship altogether, but I don't blame your husband for how he is feeling. Probably like he is in a throple he didn't know he was joining. Soft YTA.", "So Anna is in love with you, and presumably has been for a very long time. Has she expressed interest in anyone else? Or moved on? Or anything? Did you make it clear that you were not interested in her when she confessed?\n\nI understand where your husbands coming from. You are closer to her than you are to him and she's in love with you and you go on dates and you sleep over. You're infinitely closer to her and if Anna is still hanging on to the possibility of you two being together, I get why he would feel insecure.", "YTA. There's no way around it. You are definitely in the wrong here.", "YTA. Your husband did NOT sign up for this. Anna professed her love to you before you met him. You should have told him this before marrying him. You need to put your husband before Anna and stop spending so much time with her and telling her everything about your relationship with your husband. If I were him I\u2019d remove myself from this equation if you continue with your relationship with Anna at its current level.", "YTA, You pulled a bait-and-switch.. you telling your husband that he knew what he signed up for was like holding a contract up and telling him that he signed it. Only to have a specific, pertinent and pretty significant bit of information on a footnote, upside down and can only be read in Latin.\n\nSure the contract is binding, but you failed to disclose some fairly important details, such as that bombshell of a love confession from your best friend when you moved in. That is fairly scummy, and anyone would be reasonably upset by that.", "YTA. \n\nNo, your husband didn't know what he was \"signing up for\", because you didn't even know at the time that Anna was in love with you. \n\nHave a little self respect here and at least admit to yourself that Anna admitting to being in love with you does change the conversation. He was fine with your friendship, but ANNA changed the nature of that friendship when she confessed her love to you. And the fact that you can't even admit that it requires a pause and a conversation probably makes your husband even more upset/questioning about the friendship. \n\nI have a partner and a number of dear friends of all genders and sexual orientations. My best friend is a gay man, my partner knows how much he means to me. If suddenly this friend said he was in love with me, I would talk to my partner about this in a lot of detail. Assure him my feelings don't change based on this, that I realize it does create some tension, talk about how to handle this, etc etc. \n\nYour husband is only insecure because you don't care about his feelings, and don't care enough to even engage him in meaningful conversation. You don't have to \"dump\" Anna, but your husband has very valid concerns about what her confession means, and you being rude and dismissive only makes those concerns...more concerning.", "YTA.\n\nAnd not even gently. You could\u2019ve known better yourself before marrying him, and you\u2018re leading two people on so you get everything you want from both of them. That\u2018s selfish and unfair.", "I dunno. It feels like you\u2019re leading your friend on, so YTA for that part. My best friend is in love with me and we live together and go on dates. You want to get married but you don\u2019t want to take any steps toward a married life.", "INFO: You said Anna said she was \"in love\" with you. Has she made any romantic steps toward you? And if yes, do you share these feelings? And if that happened have you told your husband about any of that?", "YTA. She confessed to you and you live together?!! I honestly hope you\u2019re not having an affair with her for the sake of your husband, but it really looks like it. This is weird af. Poor husband. I feel like the best friend needs to take a major step back. You\u2019re married to your husband not to the friend.", "YTA\n\n>I **recently** told him how Anna confessed her love for me\n\n>this is what he signed up for and if he had a problem with it then **he should\u2019ve told me years ago.** \n\nHe should have told you he had a problem years ago about something you just told him?  No, this was not want he signed up for.", "YTA. And your poor friend! She\u2019s in love with you, bought a house with you, goes on dates with you, everything. This is SO not healthy for her. She deserves someone who wants to be in a relationship with her.\n\nAnd your husband deserves someone who prioritizes him as the spouse, not someone that hides the fact that their bff/roommate is in love with them.\n\nIf your husband has a friend that was in love with him and did everything your friend does with you wouldn\u2019t it bother you???", "YTA. husband should come before your friend.", "YTA because you seem to be leading two people on at the same time, and you've married one of them. Anna needs to take the hint that unless you and your husband have a mutual agreement that this is an open marriage where Anna is essentially a part of it, *of course* he's concerned that you're essentially still having a borderline romantic relationship with Anna.\n\nIt isn't *ab*normal to have a friend who's very close, but when you decide to get married to someone else, you don't get to keep the other person who loves you romantically in your back pocket. It isn't fair to your husband, and it isn't fair to Anna. It also isn't abnormal for your husband to think that once you married him, all bets were off with Anna, because that's how marriages work. It clearly isn't a throuple, and your husband didn't propose to both of you, no matter how close you are with Anna.\n\nFinally, it isn't insecurity on anyone's part but yours. You can keep Anna as a friend, but she needs to know you're with your husband for the long haul, or you need to tell your husband that you can't fully commit to him so you can...keep leading Anna on if you don't plan on fully romantically-engaging with her. Either way, choose one or choose neither, because it doesn't sound as if the three of you are interested in becoming one cohesive unit when only one of you wants to be.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" I think I might be the asshole due to how he\u2019s reacting.\" ..

It's hard for me to believe you haven't taken advantage of her feelings for you, even if it's not intentional. There's just no way that Anna feels your \"sleepovers\" and dates are simply two adults hanging out in a completely platonic way.

After all you married Rob, not Anna.\n\n>4 Years ago I met my husband and we instantly clicked. After a few weeks he met Anna and over the 2 years we dated, we all hung out several times together.\n\nThis strikes me as odd. Over two years of dating the man you'd marry you only hung out as a couple *a few times* with your all time best friend that *you live with and bought a house with?*  How is that even possible? I've never had a housemate and only hung out with their serious sig other \"a few times\" over a period of years. I've never dated someone and not hung out with her housemates/best friends many times. What this tells me is that either you were deliberately downplaying Anna's role in your life to your BF, or Anna was deliberately avoiding you two as a couple.\n\n>Rob has never previously voiced discomfort with how we are despite knowing us for 4 years. I think he only is doing this because I recently told him how Anna confessed her love for me when we first bought the house together.\n\nYou think? I *know* that is the reason. There is a big difference between \"wife is close to her best friend\" and \"wife occasionally goes on dates and sleeps with a woman she knows is in love with her.\" \n\n>I got angry when he said this and told him this is what he signed up for and if he had a problem with it then he should\u2019ve told me years ago.\n\nI mean I haven't seen your wedding vows, but I suspect they had lots of language to the effect of \"you are the most important person in my life\" and none that said \"by the way, the woman I live with is in love with me and she will always remain my first priority.\"", "YTA and your title is a lie.

I\u2019ve been friends with Anna ( fake name) since we were in kindergarten and we even went to the same college. After college we moved into a nice 1br apartment together to save money. As we grew and got our funds together we invested in a 3 bedroom and 2 bath house that we renovated together. We have lived there together for 5 years now. \n\n4 Years ago I met my husband and we instantly clicked. After a few weeks he met Anna and over the 2 years we dated, we all hung out several times together. He proposed and we ended up talking about our future. Rob ( fake name) wanted us to move in together but I didn\u2019t want to move out of my house into an apartment and he couldn\u2019t afford to make the investment in a house together. I talked to Anna and Rob moved in with us a couple months after. \n\nAfter we got married he talked to me about how my friendship with Anna made him deeply uncomfortable. I\u2019m very close with Anna and there are no filters when we talk together. We have sleepovers sometimes and go out on little \u201cdates\u201d but that\u2019s how we\u2019ve always been.   Rob has never previously voiced discomfort with how we are despite knowing us for 4 years. I think he only is doing this because I recently told him how Anna confessed her love for me when we first bought the house together. I got angry when he said this and told him this is what he signed up for and if he had a problem with it then he should\u2019ve told me years ago. \n\n\nI love my husband deeply but I\u2019m not willing to get rid of Anna just because he\u2019s insecure. We have been distant for a few days and I feel I shouldn\u2019t have been blunt but it\u2019s the truth.  I don\u2019t know what to say and I\u2019m starting to feel bad. I think I might be the asshole due to how he\u2019s reacting.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I'm really gonna be going against the grain here and say NTA (though YTA for not telling your husband about the love confession before moving him in, that's just common decency)\n\nThere's an automatic expectation by most people that romantic relationships should take the top priority in anyone's life, at all times. Considering how miserable most marriages are, I think that's insane.\n\nTrue love takes many forms, including friendship, and not everyone gets to experience it in their lives in ANY form. If you were lucky enough to find it with someone, don't throw it away because \"husband\" is supposed to outrank \"friend\". YOU get to decide what (and who) your priorities are.", "NTA.  OP, it sounds as if your husband is feeling insecure.  Ask him what he is insecure about.", "I don\u2019t think your the AH but you should maybe check out r/polyamory", "NTA, idk why people say you are leading Anna on she said how she felt about you and you didn't share the feelings so you stayed friends nothing should have to change from that. I can see why this would bother your husband at first but if he is able to be mature about it all should be well", "This one is tough for me.  Personally, this is a type of relationship I honestly would not mind my wife/gf having.  The way you write this up, your friendship with Anna doesn't sound sexual or romantic.  It sounds like a platonic life partnership, on your end.\n\nAnna, by your words, loves you romantically, and probably wishes for a more physical relationship.  However, you've seemingly made it clear that a romantic or sexual relationship will not happen.  Maybe you're not bisexual, which is ok.  But you're unwilling to separate from her.\n\nMeanwhile, you find a man, fall in love, and marry him.  He gets to know your friend, and the relationship between the two of you.  It's made him uncomfortable how close you two are.  \n\nI'm guessing by his discomfort, there is more to your relationship with Anna than you're letting on.  Yes, he should have voiced his concerns long before now.  It's hard to handle that now without hurting someone.  But, because of the life you've built, by seemingly leading two people on, someone is going to be hurt regardless.  \n\nFor now, until we hear more of the whole story, I'm going with ESH.", "Right??

My best friend and I have been together since we were 2. We *love* each other. But we don't live together, we aren't \"in love\" with each other, we're not sexually attracted to one another. OPs relationship sounds a lot like how my life could have played out (going to college and living with my bestie) if I hadn't met my spouse so young. My spouse was jealous of our relationship in the beginning because she is basically my sister, but that lasted a year or two, and now the two of them are fine with each other. \n\nThis shit is cray.

I'd never call that a date. This is so weird. OP must be very aware of the crush and level of closeness they have.", "When Anna first confessed we sat down and talked about it.

I saw your comment about talking to your husband.

Even most siblings who have grown up together wouldn\u2019t do that for anything other than desperate necessity. Sharing a bedroom deprives the other person of any guaranteed privacy and, yes, makes it awkward or impossible to have a romantic and/or sex life.

A letter to him on why you love him as a partner might be helpful especially if he wants space right now.

And if your husband isnt comfortable with that level of intimacy continuing after marriage, where he no doubt expected to fill in that portion of your life, then you can't really blame him.

It gives the message that this is our house not yours even though that's probably not your intent. Is there a compromise in this situation? Is it possible for you and your husband to buy another house and you to rent out the other two rooms of the three bedroom house Anna lives in and split the proceeds? Are you even willing to move into a house with your husband and leave your friend in her house alone? I will also say that it is unlikely that you are ever going to find a man who is going to be okay with you continuing to live with your friend forever rather than moving in with him.", "Shit like this is just a reminder that you should do a very thorough vetting process before getting married.", "Had you informed him of your history with Anna then he would have indeed known what he was \"getting into\"\nYou did no.

I tried, I had sex with other guys.  But no one would ever be Z.  \n\nSo look at this from Anna's side.  Y'all have lived together 12 years at that point.  You even call her your soulmate and sister.  You go on dates.  You're just a smidge from a couple.  She confesses her love for you. She gets rejected. \n\nShe tries her damned hardest to get over you.  She dates. She does other stuff. But you're always there. She comes home to you, her soulmate.

We had roommates when my husband and I married. It made our relationship very tense, for many reasons, but mostly because we couldn't be as physical as newly Weds want, because we had no privacy.

Has Anna moved past her feelings for OP? Do they act inappropriately? I go on \"dates\" and have sleepovers with my adult female friends of all sexualities and it's never felt like it crosses a line, so maybe I'm coming at this from a weird perspective.

Otherwise, I\u2019m not sure what the point is in telling him if she doesn\u2019t feel the same and has no intention of changing how she interacts with her best friend here.
