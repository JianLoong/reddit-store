He explained that the restaurant was on the verge of going under and asked if we would be willing to donate some of our tips to help keep the business afloat. He emphasized that it would be a temporary measure and that he would work out a repayment plan for everyone once the restaurant was back on stable footing.\n\nI rely on my tips to cover my living expenses and support my younger sibling, who is still in college. I'm already struggling financially, and giving up a portion of my tips would put me in an even more precarious position. I couldn't believe that the owner would even suggest such a thing, and I got pretty upset during the meeting. I told him that it was outrageous to expect us to sacrifice our hard-earned money when we're all just trying to get by, and I stormed out.\n\nLater, I texted the owner to apologize for my outburst and offered to pick up extra shifts or help out in other ways to support the business. He replied saying that he understood my situation, but he was disappointed in my reaction.

And if you think times are tough now, imagine how hard things would be if you didn't get your paycheck because the restaurant closed. \nThat being said, no one is ENTITLED to own a business and if it fails it fails.

The owner, unlike some owners, does appear to take an active part in the business and does work there as a chef, and you yourself have said that it is a god place to work, which suggests that he has been a good employer.\n\nThe current financial is affecting everyone and you could have had some empathy whilst also disagreeing and not being willing to hand over your tips.", "For your reaction only, YTA.   \n\nIt's okay to just say \"I'm sorry but I can't, things are rough all over\".   The getting outraged and storming out might have been a little much.  \n\nFor standing your ground and not giving up your tips, your a superstar.
