Some of my earliest memories are of her.  She is in her 90s now and has dementia but still remembers me when I stop by.  \n\nI have attended exactly one cousin's wedding and that was because she was the flower girl in my wedding 30+ years prior so I decided to shock everyone and attend.  Don't plan on attending any more.   My mom was the oldest of 14 kids--I have a LOT of cousins.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave your birthday in vegas. More important than a mere cousin's wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey just want to control you.", "NTA. I went to Hawaii for two weeks when my cousin got married about 15 years ago.

And have a great Vegas birthday!", "NTA.  Your 21st birthday means more to you than your cousin's wedding, and that seems pretty normal to me.  I feel like y'all can't possibly be close if that's the date she picked anyway.", "NTA. It's your birthday, and you are an adult who is free to celebrate a \"big\" birthday any way you wish. If you were close to your cousin, they'd have known the date of your birthday, and would have picked a different date.\n\nSend your regrets, and get them a nice gift from just you (since you're an adult), then go enjoy your birthday.", "NTA. It seems like your mom would have known that you had plans for your birthday since you have been working extra shifts.  She had no business RSVPing for you without asking. If your cousin was that worried about you showing up she should have sent you your own invitation. Go on your trip. Send them a nice gift.", "NTA. You've made plans for a while now and as an adult it's your decision whether to follow through with them or cancel due to this special occasion. Evidently the relationship with your cousin isn't close enough to cause any internal conflict. Sending a gift is a good peace offering though.", "NTA", "NTA, you are a grown up and you dont have to do anything you dont want to do.  I can understand if you were close with this cousin but you clearly said you are not and its not that big of a deal. so I say go enjoy your 21st birthday.  Have fun and turn up", "NTA You obviously aren't close otherwise she wouldn't be having her wedding on your birthday. It would be a little different if it was a sibling or a close cousin. Did they even give you any alternatives for celebrating your birthday? Your going to be 21 and you have been planning this for a while. Go have fun.", "NTA\n\nIs your cousin even upset? It looks like just the older women of the family have a problem.", "If you were close they wouldn't have picked your birthday.

Vegas\u2026.. you aren\u2019t talking about EDC are you????

I went last year and it was the most magical life changing experience ever!!!!

I think you should go to the wedding.\n\nI don\u2019t think the frequency of visits matters much\u2014I see my family maybe once a year as I live far away but I show up for weddings and such. \n\nNAH and if your family didn\u2019t know about the trip already, who\u2019s to say they would have let you go anyway?", "This.

It goes both ways.", "NTA.  You have other plans - these things happen.  Make sure you RSVP right away - that you aren't going to make it.  Wish the happy couple well - send a gift.\n\nAnd then go have a fantastic time on your birthday!!", "NTA.\n\nHate to tell you though you may miss out on the festival. Large festivals sell out faster. That includes tickets and hotels in the area. You may want to set up some alerts for flights and hotels. Even if they hotels don't sell out the prices will increase. A wedding for a cousin you barely know may not be a bad alternative. \n\nHappy early birthday!", "NTA\n\nYou had prior plans. No is a complete sentence, especially when they know it's a milestone birthday for you.", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult and old enough to know what you want as well as make your own choices and decisions.\n\nBecause you are family is NOT enough of a justification that you must alter your plans and life to suit others.", "NTA and I would be very mad to have three people waiting for me to try to make me change my mind after a 14 hours shift.", "NTA. If your presence was so important your cousin could have checked the dates with you. It wasn't and they didn't so off you go to enjoy your 21st birthday properly instead of yawning through a wedding ceremony.", "NTA\n\nIt might be their wedding, but it\u2019s your birthday. 21 is a big one too! Stay firm. Go to the festival. Have an amazing time. Good luck :)", "NTA.    \nif it helps, think about which event you will always regret not going to.  Make your decision accordingly, and don\u2019t harbour regrets.", "You have other plans and are not close enough with your cousin to care about attending her wedding. Getting your parents involved just makes her a manipulative Bridezilla. NTA", "NTA but those older women in your family are clearly having a tough time with the idea you are all grown up.", "NTA NTA NTA do t go you\u2019ll regret it", "NTA - BUT I'm going to go against popular opinion here and say you should consider going to the wedding anyway. Family is everything and there are few special occasions like this where everyone gets together from all over. It's an opportunity for you to grow closer and make the memories with your cousin and other family members.\n\nWhen you're young, you have a lot of friends. But when you're older, family becomes more important. When I was your age, I would have thought the same as you. But now I'm twice your age and I see how important the investment in family is. \n\nYour 21st is huge and a music festival in Vegas sounds awesome! That really sucks that the wedding is on your actual bday. So I totally get how you're feeling. But maybe you could do a trip and celebrate the following weekend? You can still do it up as your 21st. There's always tons going on in Vegas!\n\nETA: if you had already bought tickets and everything, I would say definitely just go. No one would expect you to eat that cost.\n\nAlso, I saw the festival you were planning to attend in another post and EDC is literally the next weekend! If you are into that sort of thing. You could totally do the wedding and family time plus celebrate your 21st at a music festival in Vegas.", "NTA", "NTA - why is your family not upset because this will clash with *their* hopes of celebrating your birthday?  Were they just expecting you to sidle past this key date without saying anything?  Also does your family know you haven't purchased anything yet for your planned trip?", "Blow off the wedding and go to your festival. You only turn 21 once. Being from the UK, I've only been to Vegas once, but it was an amazing experience. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nNTA", "Yeah, if family is SOOOOOOOOO important, OP should ask them why cousin was so rude to plan her wedding on OP's birthday!", "I\u2019m not talking about EDC though it does look dope. I\u2019m talking about Sick New World. It\u2019s a Rock/Nu-Metal festival.", "Oh believe me I was quite livid.

It does look amazing. NTA. Go to the festival. That way I can live vicariously through you lol. The festival will be way more fun, and a better memory than a wedding.", "This is the way to do it.

How fucking gracious of her.", "I know the ages of my cousins that are within a year or two of me. Get 3 or 4 years out and it gets fuzzy to me.", "NTA. You family sounds terrible. How they gonna force you to go somewhere in YOUR birthday. So what if it\u2019s Family? It\u2019s your life.", "NTA enjoy the festival!!!!", "Nta. She shouldn\u2019t have planned her wedding on a family members birthday if she wanted them to attend.", "NTA, it's an invitation, not a summons.", "nta. tell them if it's about family then why are they rallying behind only one member's important event and not the other's? that you only get one 21 and you have been looking forward to this trip for a long time. and then just keep saying no to them.", "op=NTA\n\ngo to the festival.\n\nInvitations do not require you to attend, they are an ASK.  They asked, you said no, thank you.", "NTA\n\nThis. OP send their regards.", "Plus, Op is cousins family, cousin should want her family member to have a memorable, rites of passage 21st. Works both ways. Plus, cousin might marry again but Op sure as hell won't be 21 again", "This is the way.", "Hahahaaha you must be an amazing parent.", "I'm not a parent, I live in the real world and not fantasy AITAland", "NTA. If it was your sibling,then probably. But a cousin you arent close with? No. You have a right to enjoy your milestone birthday and go on a trip you were planning before you knew about the wedding.
