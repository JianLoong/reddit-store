But my cousin (16f) let\u2019s call her Wendy (she has red hair) was the first to stop texting and calling because she has friends and she wants to talk to them and hang out with them. Which I can understand we still do talk but sometimes. The my other cousin (12f) let\u2019s call her mayo, mayo and I got closer after Wendy stop calling. We would call everyday when we weren\u2019t doing anything. But when mayo started talking to her crush and got friends we stopped talking, when I would call she wouldn\u2019t answer. We would got a couple of days or a week without talking. But when we did talk she would say \u201coh so and so is calling\u201d then she would hang up. Or she would just hang up without an excuse. So she would choose friends over family. So when me and my dad were eating out I had told him about it, I said \u201cI\u2019m not going to call anymore\u201d. Then he said \u201cwell if they were to die tomorrow you would wish you would of talked to them\u201d. I mean I see his point but they were the ones who stopped first, I\u2019m still trying they\u2019re not. So mayo started to call again, when she would call I wouldn\u2019t answer which is what she did. When I did answer we would only talk for a couple of seconds then hang up, I would also say \u201coh my friend is calling me\u201d. So a couple of days ago she asked why am i doing that I told her \u201cI\u2019m doing what you did to me\u201d she said \u201cI never did that\u201d. So we are mad at each other now, now I am starting to feel bad about what I\u2019m doing.

When you\u2019re 16 years old I guarantee you won\u2019t want to be talking to a 13 year old on the daily. If you want a genuine relationship with Wendy, be upfront instead of passive aggressive.

That\u2019s also ok\n\nIf they are now looking to reconnect, i dont see a reason you should ignore them for no reason.

If so, drop the revenge games and talk to her. And instead of showing anger \u201cwhat you did to me\u201d (which only triggers a defense response), say \u201cIt hurt my feelings when\u2026\u201d Also realize that people have other things to do in their lives and keep your conversations shorter \u2014 no one should need an excuse to end a phone conversation.

You should be the bigger person and call Mayo and apologize and explain that you felt like you were unimportant.", "A soft ESH. Yea it feels bad that y\u2019all aren\u2019t talking as much, but that\u2019s just how life goes sometimes. You should express how you feel to them. The abrupt hang ups to answer someone else is definitely rude, but doing it back is just petty, especially considering this is a relationship you want to be stronger. Tell them how you feel.", "ESH. So here's the thing about friends (this doesn't change as you grow up by the way), but you now know where you rank in their life. People naturally grow apart and people will always use certain people so they don't feel alone. You are their 'not alone friend.' You're just not as close as you thought you were. \n\nThe thing is you need to decide for yourself what kind of friendship you want with them, and then just talk honestly about it. If she doesn't respond well then she's really not your friend. That's sad because she's family, but meh it happens."]}
