They don't need to be report to the government for their relationship to be powerful and meaningful. The rings still have the same meaning, they still have the same feelings for eachother. \n\nAlso, the label \"boyfriend\" is usually not serious, but calling someone \"husband\" indicates you plan on having them as your life partner.

They did have an anniversary.  \"Anniversary\" applies to more than weddings.  They got rings to celebrate the anniversary of being together for 15 years.

There may be any number of reasons they have chosen not to be married in a legal fashion, none of which are your business. If you were concerned about them missing out on some of the legal protections and rights afforded to legally married people, you might have a valid point in the discussion. This isn't that, though, is it?\n\nAt the end of the day, there are precious few people from their generation who manage to be with the same person for 15 years. I can count on one hand how many couples I know with 15 years of marriage, let alone ones that are also still happy in their relationship. Regardless of whether or not they've married legally, they've built more of a life together in that span of time than a lot of other people. Even if they didn't refer to each other as husband and wife, they clearly are living a life together in the same fashion. In fact, depending on where you live, they may ALREADY be considered common law married, with some of those protections regardless.\n\nWhy on earth would a piece of paper provide more validity to their relationship than their actual, long-term, committed relationship existing in the first place?

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\n\nMy (30F) sister (39F) has been with her boyfriend (41M) for 15 years as of March 7th. They have no intention of getting married, they just see it as a piece of paper, but I feel differently. \n\nFor their anniversary they got each other what essentially look like engagement/wedding rings. When they started wearing the rings, they made it seem like they had gone and eloped. They had an anniversary party with friends and family, and everyone was congratulating them, but on what? \n\nShe came over yesterday and I was honest with her and said I think it\u2019s strange that they\u2019re willing to wear rings, even call each other husband and wife, but not get married. \n\nShe told me they don\u2019t need a piece of paper to tell them they can call each other husband and wife. But I argued that they\u2019re literally doing everything a married couple would do, they\u2019re just not making it official and it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I said I feel like husband and wife labels are saved for married couples. \n\nShe just said this shouldn\u2019t matter to me, it\u2019s just a label, and called me a judgmental AH. We argued for 10 minutes before she left. \n\nMy mom called me crying because my sister called her crying, and now both of them say they\u2019re disappointed in me and I\u2019m being unsupportive of my sisters decision to not get married. \n\nAITA here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You do you though.", "I had a friend that felt that way also, but she changed her mind after her partner was in an accident and she was told she was not entitled to information concerning his condition because she was not his legal spouse. After he recovered, they got married.", "YTA in what way are they harming people by doing this?", "Ytah. It\u2019s called a common law MARRIAGE.

What do you think people did before marriage was a common concept? The only difference between being married and unmarried while saying you're married is what you legally put on your taxes. That's it.", "Do words not have meaning anymore? \n\nNTA. \n\nThey ARE devaluaing marriage by saying its just a stupid piece of paper. Idk what the other commenters are on about.", "YTA, not because your not correct about them not being married by why do you care so much? So what if they wear rings?\n\nI agree, they are not married and won't be recognized as such by the law. It's not just a label. Good luck if one of them ends up in the hospital or whatnot, because I don't believe they are technically family. A host of other legal things as well.

So what if your sister uses \"husband\" instead of \"boyfriend\" or some other word/phrase?\n\nI have friends who have no intention of getting married but they say \"husband\" and \"wife\" all the time. So, it's their thing.  I know a couple who lived together and shared rings for over 20 years before they decided to get married... for property ownership rights.\n\nMy parents taught me something important I *try* to follow: **if it doesn't *directly* affect me, then it's *none of my business* what others do or don't do**.

I can understand how you might feel that way. Possibly marriage is a religious thing for you and not having that ceremony means they aren't committed to one another publicly. But, for the nonreligious it doesn't matter, they've been together for 15 years, it seems they're committed. If it still bothers you, just use your sister's bf/husband's name instead of saying \"her boyfriend\" because that will cause the least drama.

Don't know the details but I read about in on reddit..But some persons still want to be committed and be husband and wife without the legal part.\n\nSo I can understand your confusion. It's also strange for me if somebody uses the terms wife/ husband without having the legal rights and duties.\n\nThey were honest and try to establish this tradition of being wife and husband without the paper work.

Either they think it means nothing or they do \u2026 can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nBeing actually married means it\u2019s a frickin paperwork pain in the butt to break up, as well as having a bunch of good protections and privileges.", "This is silly.
