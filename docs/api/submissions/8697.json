He was always fine with just doing a few favors, and while he's never said a bad word about H, they're not as close. I'm planning on taking care of H full time when our parents are gone, not that they've forced me to do that, I just want to make sure he doesn't end up in a home.\n\nSo on to the actual issue. Our family hasn't taken a vacation since H was born, and we finally had enough saved up to take a trip during break in February. The plan was to hire a nurse to take care of H while we were gone (because of his needs he can't come) but I didn't like the idea of him being with nobody familier so I surprised our parents and offered to watch him.

You don't get to make that decision for A.\n\n\" I just think it would be good for everyone.\"\n\nAnd you've learned a valuable lesson about assumptions.  Stop assuming that A wants to be like you.  A doesn't want to be H's parent.   Back off.", "YTA. It\u2019s great that you want to help out so much but your brother has different boundaries and does not want to take on the same role, which is absolutely fair. He has no obligation to go above and beyond and it\u2019s not fair for him to be pressured to take on any role beyond sibling.", "YTA. The thing about being a martyr is, you can't volunteer others.", "YTA - he deserves to have one to one time with his parents. \n\nYour parents haven\u2019t had a break from being the parents of a special needs child, but remember, neither have you or your brother. When was the last time he got time with his parents and was not catering to little brothers needs first?", "YTA While is wonderful you enjoy helping your parents care for your younger brother it's not your responsibility. And trying to cajole your brother into taking a more active role in his care is unfair. It is not your place to decide what your brother is and is not comfortable doing. He does not want to actively care for your dIabled brother and you need to respect that fact and leave him alone.", "YTA - while it's nice of you to volunteer yourself you don't get to drag others into it. Your brother isn't interested in being a caregiver and that's his right. To ask him to give up the first vacation opportunity he's had with his parents without H there to take all their focus was actually really thoughtless.", "YTA - Can't force this kind of thing.

Are you aiming to be your brother's caregiver your whole life? Nothing wrong if that's what you're prepared to do but don't, in any way, try to guilt your other brother because he doesn't.  You may not be seeing it but I guarantee he's already missing out & lost out on many things since the arrival of the younger one.", "YTA.  This is something he would need to suggest and you were out of line to ask.  He has no interest in taking on the role of caregiver.  Kudos for you for wanting to do this, but it isn't your brother's desire or responsibility.  Apologize.", "YTA. Everyone needs a break. But your parents are solely responsible for their child.  Your brother is 15. It's absolutely ok for him to want a break, and to enjoy his vacation. You overstepped completely. You are not the parent, here.", ">I'm worried I might have overstepped, but I just want him to have a good relationship with H.\n\nBut that's not for you to decide though, is it? If you're happy with helping, go for it, but don't expect your brother to be as interested as you given that he never showed it before. \n\nA piece of advice: don't let your life revolve around your brother. Your parents are reluctant to let you and your brother help for a reason. Taking care of a person with such serious issues is hard. They want you to act your age, after all it's their job to take care of you and your brothers. I hope you are studying to find your own path, I hope you have an amazing social life and that you have dreams of your own (career or family or whatever) that have nothing to do with your brother. But most of all, don't demonise the idea of homes. At the moment you are helping your parents taking care of your brother, but they are the ones doing the majority of the work. If you decide to keep him with you full time once they're gone, keep in mind that you'll have to juggle your university life or your career (so you won't be home for hours), your own family if you want one, your social life (because it's not healthy not to have one). Your partner and children will need your attention and presence, university and work will keep you away from home for hours a day and you won't be able to pawn your brother off to other family members because you can't force them. And remember not to base your whole identity and personality on being the caring sister. If something happens to your little brother and that's all you are, it will destroy you.\n\nMaybe you've already thought of all this, I'm not going to tell you how to live your life, but please be aware of what you are signing up for.", "YTA - it is admirable that you want and chose to take on the additional care associated with your youngest brother. **You however do not get to dictate what your middle brothers role is, whether or not her does enough, or what responsibility he want to take on in the care of an exceptionally vulnerable person.**\n\nYou need to stop. You want to take on a caregiver role, he does not. You do not, cannot, and should not be trying to make decisions like this on your brothers behalf.\n\nAnd everyone is different! While you may be fine to give away your opportunity for a vacation, he may not want to do so! And you have no right to guilt him as you are.\n\nI am so sorry, and I get your want to help, but you can only control yourself so please stop trying yo force your brothers hand.", "YTA. \n\n(Wasn\u2019t this post just on here last week, except it was a father - not a younger sibling- who needed care)?", "YTA and what you're doing isn't healthy for you either. You're the first person here who parentified herself. You're currently planning to arrange your whole life around the care of your brother and while that is very  sweet of you, what about your own life? Your brother seems to have a good sense of his own life as, a, separate entity from his brother. I bet he had to go without a lot of things during the last years and he deserves a vacation as well.", "YTA you are 18 & your parents want to take a family vacation. They probably see the help you are giving & want to do something for you too. They do not want to take a trip away with just the two of them. If they did it would have been the plan from the beginning. You are going to have to learn to let others care for your brother especially since you are wanting to care for him in the future. What you are doing is not healthy for yourself.", "YTA\n\nYou can choose to care for your little brother, but you cant force someone else to\n\nOMFG what you did with the vacation was ridiculous, sure, you volunteered to be a nurse but to get your brother to do it as well is beyond inappropriate.", "YTA", "YTA - you\u2019re an adult and can go away for a holiday on your own or with friends to have a break. He\u2019s 15. Unless he goes with your parents (or invited on holiday with a friend and their parents) then he won\u2019t get a break. Why should your brother miss out? At 15 he\u2019s still a kid.

And was probably looking forward to time with his parents, parents that maybe don't normally have time for him. On top of it, you are not equipped to handle both kids. One would argue you aren't even equipped to handle one special needs kid- but that is up to your family and you to figure that out (I say this because it.sounds like it takes the 3 of you to raise him normally).\n\nYou may be excited and willing to care for your brother. This doesn't mean your brother is. Let him figure out his own life and don't dictate what he should be doing.", "YTA. A is more than likely already feeling the most put out because he\u2019s the middle child, on top of being the older sibling to a brother with special needs. No one should be expected to martyr themselves for children who aren\u2019t their own, and that includes siblings. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you want to step up and help, but I don\u2019t think you fully grasp what that means, because H currently has three caretakers to share the workload. It\u2019s going to be very different when it\u2019s just you. If you think your parents need a break, just wait until you\u2019re H\u2019s primary caregiver. Burnout is very real, and if H doesn\u2019t get used to being around caretakers who aren\u2019t related to him, you will literally never get a break. You cannot depend on A to pick up the slack for you. You\u2019re not doing anyone any favors by denying H the experience of learning to get used to strangers.", "Soft YTA you cannot decide for your brother who does not have a normal child hood bc of little bro, he can finally have his parents to himself, you decided to not want time being just you and your other brother\nYou cannot turn him into you just bc you want him to", "Parentification strikes again.\n\nYou were parentified and left to care with two younger brothers as if they were your kids. Being a good sister and helping is different from taking on care tasks for your siblings - wiping your little brothers ass has always been your parents job, your job should have always been playing with them and supporting them as they both continue to grow.\n\nYour brother is considered a \"Glass Child\", someone who is regularly overlooked and deprioritized because he's not as needy as the sick kid. Your parents do it, and you do it too. They're often blamed for having wants, needs, and dreams not associated with the sick kid who is the sole responsibility of your parents.\n\nIt's not good for everyone for him to lose the chance to hang out with his parents and be the priority for once in his life, it's good for you so you don't feel like you're missing out on your own opportunity to connect with your parents because your brother will be missing out on that time with mom and dad as well. You should not have been allowed to stay back, and your parents should have prioritized this time as connecting as a family with their kids who are often deprioritized for their sick kid.\n\nYour brother legitimately is the only one not the asshole in this situation, and YTA in the slightest sense possible for getting mad at him for not wanting to sacrafice himself too like you decided to.

Your middle bro A was only 6 when baby bro H was born.  He's probably spent his entire life watching baby bro get the bulk of the attention.  He's watched YOU put all of your attention on baby bro, not on him.  NO WONDER he doesn't want anything to do with caring for H.\n\nYour parents wanted to give ALL of you a break.  Now, they will probably feel guilty going on vacation coz you decided to say behind to watch over H.  They wanted to spend time with YOU and with A.  You may have also made your parents feel bad about this as well, but of course they will never say anything.", "YTA. Good on you for wanting to take care of your brother. Don\u2019t ever try to force anyone else to do what you want to do. You will find out that you won\u2019t have a relationship with A at all.", "NTA but I want to give you some perspective for where your brother was coming from. He was 6 when he got a new person he had to share with mom and dad (was he excited when he found out he was going to be a big brother or was he upset he wouldn't be the baby anymore? Both are understandable in a child of that age). Instead of getting the little brother that would grow up and play games with him and watch cartoons and be his partner in crime to play pranks on his big sister, he has a little brother who is often the center of attention and who will never be the little brother he may have dreamed about. Again, I am not saying it's fair but I can understand how he may feeling some resentment.\n\nSo now after 9 years of having his whole world turned upside and dealing with the grief for the brother that may have been and feeling like a forgotten child, he finally gets to go on a vacation with his parents and for once his disabled brother won't be the main focus of everything because to give all of them a break they are going to hire a nurse. He was probably looking forward to the trip and maybe after going on it it would have helped his attitude towards H (maybe having a chance to be the only child with is parents for a bit would fill a void)  a bit but now you are springing it on him to give up his chance to spend some time a lone with his parents for the first time in 9 years and to help you with the brother he feels stole his parents from him. \n\nYour experience is different because you had 6 years of your parents to yourself and than 6 years of getting to have the little brother who could be your playmate so when your other younger brother came who needed more attention, you were in a position where you could put him first and feel like there was no void in your life. While I agree A should try to help out more with your younger brother I can understand while he is feeling resentful.\n\nAgain you are not an AH but I am trying to help you understand where your brother his coming from. Also you can't force him to spend time with his younger brother. I went through a similar thing with my sister when our grandma when was terminally ill, I was the nurse and she couldn't even talk to her or even go in her room but in the end, the day came when my grandma was gone and she now has to live with that guilt. Sadly A may have to learn his lesson the same way she did. \n\nI would just tell your brother that you are sorry for making him feel that way and that you hope he has a nice trip with your parents, if he comments something about feeling bad for lashing at your or anything just suggest to him that if he wants to start helping more with H after his trip you will be happy to show him the ropes but if he doesn't that's okay and if he changes his mind you will be there to help hm.", "NAH\n\nYou're both allowed to be yourselves and if A felt pressured into being a carer at 15 I can see why ye could react badly. \n\nGood on you for doing your best to help out.", "NTA assuming you asked A in a nice way that left the decision up to him (not leading or forcing him)\n\nReason of giving your parents a break I appreciate, him \u201clearning a thing or two\u201d not so much. You can\u2019t force a relationship. If A wanted to bond with H then he would. Maybe he will someday but you need to respect him and his boundaries. \n\nAlso while it\u2019s very kind and good of you to have this wonderful relationship with H and wanting to take care of him - that was your decision as you said. It\u2019s not your responsibility but you wanted to take on that role. It\u2019s clear A doesn\u2019t want to at the moment, nor should he have to. It\u2019s not his responsibility either.", "Was the way in which you asked him this genuinely open-ended? I.e. clearly no hard feelings if he was to decline? As long as that\u2019s the case, then definitely NTA, he\u2019s overreacting and maybe projecting some guilt about his lack of involvement (like yknow, over-justifying himself and kinda making up a scenario where he\u2019s the victim)", "NAH it's one thing that you CHOSE to step in. But it should never be expected of minor children to become the keeper for their siblings. He isn't obligated to do anything in terms of caring for the youngest. \n\nIt's not AH territory for either of you, as long as you can respect that he chooses differently than you.", "NTA for suggesting it but you and your brother are different people. Do not force your feeling/wants/desires onto him.", "NAH, nothing wrong with asking. You just have to accept his answer.", "YTA. Your brother is 15. Don't burden him with the expectations of parentification. I have a younger brother who is disabled who I take care of. I don't regret it for a moment. But the choice to do so was more or less made for me by the time I was your brothers' age, and that wasn't fair. Don't make a teenager feel guilty for not sacrificing and investing in your other brothers' care.  Someday he might be ready to be more involved, but this is not the time, and whenever that time comes (if it does) it should be because he wants to- not because he was expected to.", "Mild YTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for the situation you find yourself in, it must be really tough. And fair play to you for choosing to take on such a big role in H\u2019s care now and in the future. But by trying so hard to care for H you are being an asshole to A. He\u2019s still a kid, he deserves to be allowed to just be a kid. You shouldn\u2019t pressure him to take on a role that he doesn\u2019t want (and it also sounds like your parents don\u2019t want that role for him either).\n\nLet the nurse take care of him and enjoy the vacation, and more importantly please allow your brother and parents to enjoy it too.", "YTA\n\n>I'm worried I might have overstepped, but I just want him to have a good relationship with H.\n\nYou're going about this the wrong way. Forcing A to be a caregiver to H isn't promoting a good relationship between them; it'll only foster resentment. A is a much a child as H. Let him have a vacation with your parents. \n\nAnd with all due respect, you need to learn to step back every now and then and let a professional watch H so you can take your own breaks. Caregiver burnout is real.", "YTA. You can\u2019t force your brother. In all fairness you need to take a vacation while you can. Caregiver burnout is a real thing. It would be good for your mental health to do something other than take care of your brother. Do you go out with friends or have other hobbies?", "YTA - If you want to commit to caring for H fine but back the hell off your other brother. A didn\u2019t decide to have a child and hasn\u2019t offered or indicated any interest in taking on that burden and DOES NOT HAVE TO. Focus on your own life and choices and leave your brother to his.", "YTA. Just because you want to spend the rest of your life as a caregiver for your younger brother, doesn\u2019t mean A wants to do the same. You are stepping up for a lifetime of responsibility and your brother doesn\u2019t want that for himself. Stop trying to force your opinions on others.", "YTA\n\nAnd you need to take a hard look at your stance about nurses and outside caregivers. Do you plan to never marry? Never go on vacation? Never have a job? \n\nAlso, you should join a gym and start a serious muscle building regimen. You may be able to physically take care of your brother now, but when he's a grown man how do you plan to lift him or bathe him?", "YTA \nlike others have said its great you want to help and take care of your brother when your parents are gone, but you can\u2019t force that onto anyone. \nOthers have explained this already so I\u2019m going to move on to my advice to you. \n\nIf you are serious about caring for your brother when your parents are no longer able to then you need to let your parents take care of him now and focus on yourself. You are going to need a career that will pay the bills and not just home,food,clothing but you will be in charge of his medical bills which if you live in America are so large people go homeless everyday. You need to find a job with incredible pay as well as incredible freedom because you will either need to hire someone to care for him while you are working or you will need to work from home with a job easy enough to do in your spare time from care giving.

Live it.", "YTA You need to learn the same lesson many step parents need to learn: By trying to force a relationship you will only make it worse.\n\nIf A feels pressured by you to care more about H he will in the end only funnel that negativ feeling of being pressured onto H and that will only end up in resentment. \n\nI get that you want to give your parents a break but there is a good chance that A needs some quality time with his parents too since many children with disabled siblings feel neglected because of all the extra attention the disabled sibling requires. You may need that time too and are just to absorbed in your role as caretaker for H to realise it.", "N T A if all you did was ask and accept the response.

But it\u2019s your decision and your other brother does not want to do that. I truly wish you the absolute best.", "I think that your heart is in the right place. It speaks highly of you that you are willing to give up so much for your family.  But I have to echo the sentiment that you need to consider your own life as well as your middle brother's. Bless you and I really hope you can find time to focus on yourself. 18 is the start of your life.", "Soft YTA, it\u2019s great you want to do this for your parents but you shouldn\u2019t ask A to", "yta. you most definitely overstepped and honestly you should apologize unless H is the only brother you care about", "You overstepped here. YTA", "YTA.  It's great that you want to step in but you shouldn't put your wants on your brother.  It is asking A LOT of a 15 year old to take care of a younger disabled child.  Quite frankly I think you need to make sure you don't get trapped later in life by being a full-time, never ending caretaker.  I know you love your brother but you still need to live your life and, unfortunately, your parents won't be around forever.", "NTA. Assuming your wording is honest, I don't think that suggesting to your brother that he might stay home with you and your sibling in order to give your parents some time away is an asshole thing to do. Quite the opposite, in fact. If you were constantly pushing your brother about it, or trying to make him feel like shit for not agreeing to it, that would be asshole territory.   \n\n\nHe's well within his rights to turn you down, obviously. But all the nuances about whether that makes him an asshole or not will have to wait for his reddit post.", "I would imagine that he is acting like most 15 yr old boys would act.  Don\u2019t hold it against him.  You\u2019re quite unselfish for someone your age, but you can\u2019t expect everyone else to be the same.  \n\nIt took many years to realize that if I have expectations from others, I will only be disappointed", "NTA\n\nAsking your brother to help out is not overstepping and does not make you an AH. \n\nThat being said, if your brother doesn\u2019t want to help, he is still a kid himself and obviously does not have to and that choice should be respected. \n\nop asked brother for a favor and brother freaked out over literally being asked. Unless there\u2019s missing info and op got upset and did not respect her brothers response, I don\u2019t see how she\u2019s the AH", "Nta, my oldest brother of 6 had his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck during birth and has a severe stuttering and developmental problems. Life has been hard as he needs attention more than everyone else. But there isnt anything i wouldnt do for him. You simply asked your brother if hed be willing to help. You didnt try and force him or guilt trip him into it. It is honestly disgusting how so many people dont give 2 shits about their family and only care about their lives. Yes you should focus on building yourself but you should always look after family. You did however find out whats gonna happen when your parents pass, you will be the only one looking out for your brother. Start thinking about what you will have to do and sacrifice in the future because you dont have a strong backing behind you", "NAH.  You mean well, but you\u2019re taking on extra responsibilities for H voluntarily, not because your parents can\u2019t provide care.  H will not be neglected and you will not be overburdened if A remains distant.  He\u2019s allowed to have as close or as superficial a relationship as he wants with any member of your family, as long as he\u2019s not disruptive, and you haven\u2019t mentioned anything like that.  \n\nIt sounds like you have some anxiety around H\u2019s care and comfort, which is understandable but not healthy.  Particularly if you are planning to be H\u2019s caregiver for life, you need to be able to deal with periods of separation and sometimes trusting others with his care.", "And to play devil's advocate: he also didn't get the several years of being an only child like op or the 9 years of getting to be a \"normal family\" who goes on vacations. He probably thought op was trying to do something kind of him by letting him go on a trip with just his parents and now she is making him feel guilty.", "Couldn\u2019t have said it better. Are you going to feel resentful of your brother when your parents die, you become a full-time caretaker and he has a life of his own, OP?", "Op is also completely ignoring what the parents wanted. It\u2019s not a family vacation if none of the kids go. They don\u2019t actually want her to skip out, and are only letting her stay because she\u2019s insisting.", "Yes it was.", "OP is going to burn out. Let the nurse care for your brother.\n\nWhat is your plan for your own life other than caring for your brother? Do you want to marry, have kids? It\u2019s going to be hard to find a partner willing to take on this responsibility as a package deal especially when brother becomes a full grown adult.", "I don't think this can be called parentification. OP is not being forced to care for H or put into a parental role; she is actively volunteering to do so where perhaps it seems the parents might not always want that for her (e.g. her convincing them to let her miss the holiday).", "He is 15. He shouldnt feel guilt. His parents aren't making him feel guilt. The only person making him feel guilt seems to be OP.", "Why should he feel guilt? He wasn't part of the decision about having a third child. He didn't cause H to suffer loss of oxygen. It doesn't seem his parents wanted either of their children to be long-term carers or lose their childhood  - OP pushed for that to be the case for herself and now seems to feel that she is the one who gets to make decisions about her brother's care and who does it. That responsibility still rests with her parents. The parents may have been looking forward to spending one on one time with her and her oldest brother but OP has changed the plans with her insistance.  \n\nThe parents are willing to employ professional help and hopefully are lining up long-term support. Yes, the brother might benefit from someone familar but many children of same developmental age cope well with nurses and daycare. OP can volunteer herself as a nurse but I hope she has someone professional in the wings monitoring. What she doesn't get to do is try and teach her brother to be the respite care in the future. He's the only one that can decide if he has the capability to do that. \n\nI also hope the parents are considering long-term care because as H ages, things may be more complicated. H's body will keep growing and be harder to lift and guide, he'll hit puberty and his needs will be more complex. The parents are probably being sensible getting him used to external help now. With the best will in the world, OP may not be able to offer what H needs.", "Yes because op got to be an only child for 6 years and have her parents to herself and then get the little brother she wanted who could play games and be her playmate now A who  has never gotten his parents to himself and who had to share them with a brother who will never be the  brother he dreamed of (someone he can play games with, teach how to ride a bike, watch a movie with etc. )is finally getting the chance to spend some time with his parents one on one and possibly fill a void in his life (and maybe make him less resentful towards his younger brother). How dare A have feelings and emotions!", "Well yeah that\u2019s what I mean, he probably subconsciously feels guilty that he\u2019s not pulling his weight as he ought to, which is why he feels so \u201cput on the spot\u201d by a simple question like this. But again that\u2019s assuming it WAS just a simple question, not a pointed, loaded one, which just isn\u2019t a good way of handling things even when coming from a valid place."]}
