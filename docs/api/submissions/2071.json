At his age, he can\u2019t be expected to understand the nuances of infidelity.\n\nYour ex cheated and expected you to raise the child of his affair. And it sounds like he has some pretty unreasonable expectations of you now.

I get he is not your child and you don't see him as your child, but you are only confusing him by staying in his life. For his sake let your ex figure out child care because Caden is confused about who you are to him. He doesn't understand that you were just a responsible adult who helped take care of him while you were with his father.", "YTA.. Massively .. It takes a cold hearted woman to raise a child for his first three years of life and have no motherly love for him. You talk about him more as a pet that you had to feed and water rather than a family member. You was married to his father, That makes you his stepMOTHER. You are all he knows as a mum so when you had a baby he assumed that it was his sister, What would have been so wrong to let him think that? at least until he was old enough to understand better? You come across as mean, cold and indifferent to that poor boy, shame on you.", "YTA and my heart just broke a little for poor Caden.", "yta I think its kinda hurtful to the kids feelings but he isnt your daughters sibling, if they are close mabye that could be his sister from another mother?

You weren't harsh and the kid just got upset because that's how kids are.", "Yeah YTA. Rubbing it into a small child's face that you still don't consider them family.", "Perhaps stepping away completely is the best option you hurt the kid. He sees you as a mother figure he sees your baby as a sibling if that's not something you want in this case stepping away is the best thing to do.\n\n\n\nEdit yta for dragging out contact with a child who even in your narrative you hold resentment for. Your tone is cruel and so are your actions. \n\nFYI siblings aren't only blood some of my closest siblings I don't share a drop of blood with didn't even meet them until I was a teenager but bet your ass if someone said that's not my sister I'm tell going to them off", "What is wrong with people here being mean to kids??? \n\nTo be clear it\u2019s not even about the brother/ buddy thing but this kid didn\u2019t wake up one morning and got suddenly confused.\n\nYTA", "NTA you will get a lot of Y  T  A about being cruel because he's only little. But children need a very clear idea of who is who and who is related to who and in what way. Just like children need to be told they are adopted when they are little. We've all seen the delusions and fantasy's and false narratives parents have created in their young kid's head in order to, 'be kind' and it really screws them up long term, because they cannot ditch the false narratives and embrace the truth.", "YTA.\n\nMy stepmom decided to tell me out of the blue one day when I was maybe 5 that my brother was not me *real* brother because we had different dads.

I know you think you were being truthful, but if the kids consider themselves siblings there was honestly no reason to do this other than to get a petty jab in.", "YTA - You're projecting your anger that your ex cheated on you onto a 5yo! You can not be serious. What harm would it do if they were to consider each other siblings other than taking a hit to your own ego? Family is about more than just blood, and to try and break a 5 yo like this is absolutely absurd.", "Ugh...I'm not sure I can declare a sentence here. You say that you weren't a mother, and yet you cared for this child the entire first 3 years of his life and still watch him occasionally. It seems to me that he considered you to be his mother. And so, by extension, he considers your daughter to be his sister. You telling him that he was not her brother was basically you telling him he's not part of your family. I feel for that little boy. How confusing and heartbreaking for him - at only 5 years of age!   \n\n\nI don't think it was right for your ex to get furious at you, but I also don't think you've properly considered your role in this child's life.", "YTA. Kids are delicate.", "NTA\n\nThey aren't. Your ex has obviously tried/did force the mother role on you, even after you divorced him.  He was never able to be comfortable with others because your ex made it seem like you were the mother in his life.

Sure, it's gonna be hard for him to understand, but it would be MUCH more cruel to let him go on believing that untruth until he is even more attached to OP's daughter. Especially when OP said in a comment that the plan was to move out of the kid's life in three years. Better to set that boundary now than 3 years from now. Now the kiddo can adjust to the reality before they all leave his life. I really feel for Caden, though. He probably feels very unwanted atm.

Your daughter can be a sister to him without her being a blood sister, and for you to go out of your way to invalidate the fact that he sees her as his family is unnecessarily cruel. Also, how do you look after a kid, feed him, and take care of him when he\u2019s sick for the first 3 years of his life and claim not to be any kind of mother figure? You were his mom figure for more than half of his life so far, and telling him that he\u2019s not your daughter\u2019s brother is such a harsh rejection.

Kid is 5 and to him you are the only \u2018mom\u2019 he has known in his life. And you basically just straight up told him you don\u2019t feel that same bond. I get your position, but if this is how you feel towards him, that he is just a kid you feed and make sure doesn\u2019t die, you and his dad might need to work something out that is in his better interests.

While you mat not view yourself in that way, that doesn\u2019t mean HE hasn\u2019t. Especially when you still babysit him. I also wonder why OP would even still babysit for her ex at all. Considering how you can just FEEL the resentment she has for him, how did that end up still continuing? I do also want to know what the ex has been telling Caden in regards to OP and her new daughter. There definitely needs to be a conversation there between OP and ex. Overall though, that definitely could\u2019ve been handled better.\n\nAs a side note; family does not have to strictly be blood.

It's not his fault you suck. Why deprive your daughter of a wonderful relationship? He also apparently loves you quite a lot and you can't bring yourself to be genuinely kind to a child?

She should have left that first relationship when she found out he cheating. Staying but showing no love to the child you raise is going to leave some permanent wounds on that poor child.

The father was terrible for cheating but OP is terrible for staying and with-holding love from a poor child and then leaving and maintaining this messed up relationship. Honestly, I think OP doing this at a time when the child is already feeling unloved, unwanted and confused, that was a pretty cruel thing to do. How can someone who raised a child not have any compassion or empathy for them? Poor boy. These adults are messing him up.", "Kids arent emotionally developed enough to handle that kind of talk.

It didn't make sense for her to leave because bs reasons.", "I find it odd that you\u2019re still talking to your ex, but I digress. You need to set a clearer boundary and cut off the child or you will continue to have issues with him thinking he\u2019s closer to your family than he actually is", "Your ex is a man who had child with another woman while you were together. His actions are those of a manipulative and selfish person. I understand your empathy for Caden, but you don't want to be his mother. So it's best if you walk away now. Your ex is never going to respect your boundaries because he didn't respect them while you were a couple. Caden isn't going to understand the nuances of your situaiton. You are doing more harm than good by staying in his life. You also need to do what is best for your family. You told Caden he could be your daughter's buddy. Nothing in you wants to be this childs mother. Nothing in you really wants him to be apart of your family. I think guilt and manipulations from your ex is what is making you stay in this child life when you don't want to be. Get out now it is what is best for you, him, and your daugter.", "And yet she went on to list all the motherly things she did for him right after that statement.   \n\n\nShe may not have considered herself to be his mother, but a toddler doesn't know the difference. She was there. His bio mother wasn't. He most likely naturally attached to her like any child would with a motherly figure.", "She was married to the child's father, the child lived there full time, the child still sees her as a mother figure, so she clearly did more than just babysit.", "I'm an adult who cares for him. I'm not his mother and I would never try to take her place. And he does love my daughter. She's only 7 months old.", "Exactly\n She should have ended all contact when she left her ex husband, but I think she did see herself as a mother to him, right up until her \"surprise\" biological child came along, now she sees herself as a babysitter to a child she has played a huge part in raising for their entire life", "Nice of you to assume OP hasn't been a complete willing volunteer for a continued relationship with the child . I'm sure her ex just cheated on her then convinced her against her will to continue seeing his son .\n      Like what's your goal here a lifelong relationship where you take any opportunity given to let him know he's an affair child", "No, it's not. Blended families do not include the child your ex had with someone else, especially within the marriage.This kid is no family and has no place to call the Op baby sister.", "That is possible but I wouldn't know that because I have no contact with my ex other than him asking me to babysit Caden. I literally don't respond to any small talk initiated by him.", "This. Unfortunately your ex wants to exploit this so his child feels like he also has a sister. It doesn't make sense he got upset", "That I agree with and I see where you are coming from.  I guess it is a form of semantics with who calls what whom at 5 years old and it wasn't a necessary comment.  I just am having a hard time agreeing with his dad who put everyone through this.", "I don't talk to my ex. I just babysit Caden when my ex can't arrange childcare. I do it because he's a little kid who needs a responsible adult caring for him while his father isn't around.", "I agree. You are NTA. \n\nIt is understanding that the kid is confused. Especally if his father is lying. \n\nThe father is the asshole.\n\nBut I suggest boundaries in the future. \nWhen you want to move away you should start slowly now.", "I'm not saying she's not a willing caregiver but she's been in his life since he was born. That's why I said while it might be hard, it's in everyone's best interest to create some distance...", "Exactly.  If you are just a sitter to this boy and your ex then your ex wouldn't act thus way.\n\n\nYou need to tell him that you are no longer babysitting.  That his child needs to learn how to make relationships with others and that you are not going to pretend that his son is your daughters sibling so your ex doesn't have to be honest with him.  Your ex needs to learn that you don't owe him or his kid anything and he is putting this on you when he was the one who had a kid with someone else.", "His dad is absolutely an AH. This child is 5, she left his father when he was 3, and the last 2 years she has continued to play a big role in his life, if she didn't want to be seen as a mother to him, she should have cut contact when he was 3, it would have been far easier for him to adapt to that new life than what he's having to deal with now", "But as you know now   - your ex tries to burden you with the role of his mother. He makes to belive his son that you are his mother. His kid may not call you so, but He still thinks you are.\n\nI could not do what you did. Helping raising the child of your ex and his AP. You did not wrong. You helped.  But did not patrent him or loved him as a mother. And now you still help.\n\nBut it seems like you are beeing used to gulity trap you. To always be a easy solution for the father. \n\nNow you know. Do you want to play a roll of the mother? If not, stop babysitting him. No matter what you tell the kid - as long as the father will lie, the kid will not unverstand.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit:spelling", "If your ex is not respecting your boundaries, then it's time to stop doing him favors. He is an adult and Caden is his responsibility. He can arrange child care for him and do it himself.", "I 100% agree, and looking at it, this only seemed to become an issue after her own daughter was born after fertility issues.  I don't want to draw too many conclusions here, but I know women with fertility issues that have attached themselves to kids only to toss them to the side when they have one of their own.   Well stated!", "Yes, it seemed she was fine being seen in a mother role, even though she's now downplaying that role, right up until her \"surprise baby\" came along, now she's the babysitter. The only one paying the price for the actions of all the adults in this is this little boy."]}
