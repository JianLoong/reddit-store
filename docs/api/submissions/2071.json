At his age, he can\u2019t be expected to understand the nuances of infidelity.\n\nYour ex cheated and expected you to raise the child of his affair.

I get he is not your child and you don't see him as your child, but you are only confusing him by staying in his life. For his sake let your ex figure out child care because Caden is confused about who you are to him. He doesn't understand that you were just a responsible adult who helped take care of him while you were with his father.", "YTA.. Massively .. It takes a cold hearted woman to raise a child for his first three years of life and have no motherly love for him. You talk about him more as a pet that you had to feed and water rather than a family member. You was married to his father, That makes you his stepMOTHER. You are all he knows as a mum so when you had a baby he assumed that it was his sister, What would have been so wrong to let him think that? at least until he was old enough to understand better?

Your tone is cruel and so are your actions. \n\nFYI siblings aren't only blood some of my closest siblings I don't share a drop of blood with didn't even meet them until I was a teenager but bet your ass if someone said that's not my sister I'm tell going to them off", "What is wrong with people here being mean to kids??? \n\nTo be clear it\u2019s not even about the brother/ buddy thing but this kid didn\u2019t wake up one morning and got suddenly confused.\n\nYTA", "NTA you will get a lot of Y  T  A about being cruel because he's only little. But children need a very clear idea of who is who and who is related to who and in what way. Just like children need to be told they are adopted when they are little. We've all seen the delusions and fantasy's and false narratives parents have created in their young kid's head in order to, 'be kind' and it really screws them up long term, because they cannot ditch the false narratives and embrace the truth.", "YTA.\n\nMy stepmom decided to tell me out of the blue one day when I was maybe 5 that my brother was not me *real* brother because we had different dads.

I know you think you were being truthful, but if the kids consider themselves siblings there was honestly no reason to do this other than to get a petty jab in.", "YTA - You're projecting your anger that your ex cheated on you onto a 5yo! You can not be serious. What harm would it do if they were to consider each other siblings other than taking a hit to your own ego? Family is about more than just blood, and to try and break a 5 yo like this is absolutely absurd.", "Ugh...I'm not sure I can declare a sentence here. You say that you weren't a mother, and yet you cared for this child the entire first 3 years of his life and still watch him occasionally. It seems to me that he considered you to be his mother. And so, by extension, he considers your daughter to be his sister. You telling him that he was not her brother was basically you telling him he's not part of your family. I feel for that little boy.

Sure, it's gonna be hard for him to understand, but it would be MUCH more cruel to let him go on believing that untruth until he is even more attached to OP's daughter. Especially when OP said in a comment that the plan was to move out of the kid's life in three years. Better to set that boundary now than 3 years from now. Now the kiddo can adjust to the reality before they all leave his life. I really feel for Caden, though. He probably feels very unwanted atm.

While you mat not view yourself in that way, that doesn\u2019t mean HE hasn\u2019t. Especially when you still babysit him. I also wonder why OP would even still babysit for her ex at all.

That\u2019s fucking cold.", "OP has been clear that while she\u2019s a caregiver, she has never taken on a parental role. These are different things. Kids in orphanages may attach to caregivers there, but that doesn\u2019t turn the caregivers into mothers, or make their roles motherly. OP\u2019s relationship with this kid is wholly at the mercy of her ex. The child\u2019s mother is still alive, and a person, and might also object to OP stepping into a more matronly space. OP is kind to the little guy, but that\u2019s the most anyone can ask of her.", "No actually she wasn\u2019t. She included him in meals and took care of him when sick so the husband could work.

Why are you still interacting with this child that you don\u2019t consider yours instead of stepping back and giving your ex an opportunity to find a suitable caregiver? Why are you bringing your kid and your friends kid around this child to make such a distinction that they are siblings but he isn\u2019t? You don\u2019t have empathy. You seem to want to torment this kid for your husbands infidelity. This behavior is absolutely disgusting. Leave your ex and his child alone. They have enough to deal with because his biological mom is in a mental hospital. YTA.", "You aren't going to be able to set that boundary when your ex is telling the child the opposite. The longer the babysitting and being that adult in his life continues, the worse it's going to be for Caden in the long run", "My thoughts exactly. I currently have a 6 yr old and a 3 yr old so I know all too well what a kid at this age could understand. There's no way kids at this age could comprehend that their real mom is far away and this woman taking care of them isn't a mother figure. Real attachments have been made.", "I'm sad for this kid. They all are f... his mind.", "I didn't forget. The key point is that she's not there. This child has experience \"motherly care\" through OP. That's the only mother he actually knows and he's built that bond. A child under the age of 5 wouldn't understand the concept of a bio mom that's not in the picture.", "And she stipulated that she didn't act like a mother, you are aware parents occasionally stay with flatmates, hell I stayed with my dad and brother when I had mine, I can assure you that they do not get called dad.\n\nI stand by the Dad being the Ahole, it is heartbreaking that the kid is hurt but she doesn't consider herself the kids mum, end of.", "No, she\u2019s not living with him.

And it\u2019s cruel to yank away a relationship they perceive themselves to have (which is what OP did, gently or not - that child will never view the other child the same way now). If the kids regard themselves as siblings, they\u2019re siblings and there\u2019s nothing wrong with having that relationship. \n\nAs the kids got older they probably would have started to notice subtle differences in their family dynamics vs. others\u2019 family dynamics and they probably would have started asking questions on their own. At that point the situation could have been addressed as a simple matter of genetic science *but* I would never advocate for insisting the kids weren\u2019t siblings if that\u2019s how they view themselves. My brother and I were not very close growing up and honestly that revelation from my stepmom was part of the reason. We\u2019re in a much better place as adults (and he is my real brother regardless of parentage), but that\u2019s a lot of years I missed out on a great relationship because an adult insisted on being right rather than nurturing and encouraging relationships.", "You've already confused him.

I think she downplayed her initial role in this child's life. If she was ambivalent to this child's existence then why continue to care for him after she left his father.

Everyone pinning it on a 5 year olds brain, ntm if his mom is in a mental hospital who\u2019s to say he didn\u2019t stew in that in her womb? This poor kid.

If OP\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s not Caden\u2019s mom, and there\u2019s no confusion that her ex is not her daughter\u2019s dad, then Caden will figure it out for himself that they\u2019re not blood related when he gets old enough to understand how parentage works (probably in just another 3-5 years). \n\nUnlike acknowledging a parental figure to a child (which may come with legal ramifications and adult messiness), there\u2019s no real negative to kids thinking of each other as siblings. Unless of course, OP means to distance herself and her daughter from Caden one day. But if that is her intention (and the reason she doesn\u2019t want the two developing a sibling-like relationship) then she would be kind of an AH for not ripping that bandaid off already.

That would\u2019ve been equally wrong in my opinion and unnecessary.", "NTA When the boy becomes an adult he\u2019s going to therapy cause the adults he cared about lied to him. The father must have told him that OP was his mother to give the child and intact family which was a lie. This child was a child of infidelity. Not the child fault but that\u2019s what he was. They are lucky OP did anything for him. She definitely didn\u2019t have to do anything and would have been excused for her actions\ud83e\udd7a", "I figured the OP was financially dependent on her husband and had no support system to go to at the time. Finding a job, saving money, and building your credit enough to get approved for an apartment all takes time.", "OP, I hope you read the comment above. You're taking on a responsibility that you're not required to do since Caden is not your son (as you said so yourself). You're a better person than me because I would have left without looking back. The ex can arrange for his own childcare.", "My feel sympathy for the child but not for the mother. Ill nor not, she was still an AP. \n\nI agree that the OP should not keep herself around Caden if she really wants to set a proper boundary. Being a part of the kid's life isn't doing him any favors and only causes confusion. It's the father's responsibility to arrange childcare.", "If that\u2019s the case, she really needs to cut the cord now. Whatever OP thinks of her relationship with him, he obviously considers her a mother-figure; delaying that inevitable heartache for him will only make it hurt even more for the poor kid. \n\nI was originally on the fence, but I\u2019m going to go with YTA because OP has clearly not thought enough about how her actions and continuing to fill this role for Caden will affect him in the long term. She claims she\u2019s trying to set boundaries, but right now, she\u2019s the one obfuscating them. The kid does not have the ability to understand the nuances in these relationships.", "If her intentions were to maintain a relationship (even as only a sometime caretaker), she would not need to lie to him in order to not hurt his feelings. If it\u2019s a known thing to Caden that she is not his mom, and that his dad is not OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s dad, then he would have put two-and-two together on his own in a few short years anyway. And it wouldn\u2019t have been some sort explosive revelation, just a truth that\u2019s always been there that he\u2019s allowed to process on his own time. \n\nThat said, another comment said OP has no intention of staying in Caden\u2019s life, so I do think she is an AH for dragging it on and making it worse for Caden when he does lose his \u201cfamily\u201d, regardless what label OP insists to put on it. That\u2019s how the kid sees them. That\u2019s his reality. Caden is not the one failing to keep boundaries; OP is.", "That\u2019s a great older sibling to have\u2014someone with funds to buy you cookies, treats, and gifts. Lol", "Yup, that too, which is a detail I think a lot of people are glossing over for some reason. The father created this *entire* fucking situation and OP has just made the best of it from what I can tell.", "hard agree. i lost both my parents at 3. i was raised by my aunt who i wound up calling mom. my \u201ccousin\u201d became my \u201cbrother\u201d (he was 21 when i went to live with her) but he took me on the weekends and i definitely saw him as a father figure. it took a lot of counseling for me to figure out family when i was little. OP is nta, but the kiddo could sure use some help", "In some indigenous communities cousins are called siblings", "im sorry but when was play siblings common in pop communities ?", "My sister and I raised her daughter together after my sister's first husband died. But, its not like the kid ever was confused about who I was.", "Yea they both did. For some reason hers seems to be stronger despite not living with me. While both took their first steps with me, she refused to walk unless I was near. Used to get her mom upset, and at 6 she still says I\u2019m her favorite. Is not 100% now like when she was a baby, but is enough that when her mom gave our cousin a gift she didn\u2019t care. But when it was my turn to give the gift she was upset and complained I didn\u2019t get her one. \n\nAll in all, kids can be very complex. And even when the mother is present they can easily build attachments. I feel like OP should\u2019ve set boundaries earlier on. Even if that wouldn\u2019t be enough like in the case of my cousin, it would be enough so his feelings don\u2019t get hurt.", ">Now I wasn't a mom to him at all, just a responsible adult\n\nExcept that she wasn't a mother, everyone just keep pushing that role into her.", "Yes very true anyone should have compassion with this situation but it seems the child is paying for the adults Inability to communicate.", "Yeah, she shouldn't have agreed to babysit after the divorce, but now it's absolutely high time to distance herself and stop this confusing situation for that poor kid. He is already messed up by their actions, now it's time for OP to do damage control (staying out of his life) and for the father to try to undo the damage as much as possible.", "Exactly. Kids are complicated. This poor kid is in a tough situation. I feel for him. I imagine that continuing to provide babysitting for him isn't helping him learn what role she expects to play in his life from now on.", "Possibly, but that's not the child's fault. To him, she was the only mother he actually experienced.", "Hmm, ok, so, living with the child fulltime, whilst being married to the father, and doing all the roles a mother would do as the little boy develops and he's never once called her mom, sounds highly plausible", ">Sounds pretty much like she was trapped to me. \n\nI thought the same thing because it sounds like she couldn't leave due to circumstances. It would help if OP was a lot more concise. Her statement was vague. \n\nIt could be she was financially dependent on her ex and had no other family or support system. It would take time to find a job, save, and be approved for a place to live. As much as i would hate the husband, I'd stay with him in the house temporarily to prevent starvation and homelessness. But yeah, OP should be more specific to prevent confusion.", "Yeah honestly confused how you\u2019re getting trapped with no options from OP being \u201cin a vulnerable space\u201d\n\nAnd obviously her ex was awful and wrong for cheating on her, no one is saying he isn\u2019t. Life isn\u2019t some zero sum game.", "I really feel bad for Caden in all of this.", "I honestly feel that her stopping babysitting would do more harm than good. Especially after what she told him, he may be greatly traumatized by doing this. I feel she should slowly set boundaries.", "I think he has a mother.  She's institutionalized but I'm guessing if he did call her mom she corrected him."]}
