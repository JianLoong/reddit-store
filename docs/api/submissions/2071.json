At his age, he can\u2019t be expected to understand the nuances of infidelity.\n\nYour ex cheated and expected you to raise the child of his affair.

I get he is not your child and you don't see him as your child, but you are only confusing him by staying in his life. For his sake let your ex figure out child care because Caden is confused about who you are to him. He doesn't understand that you were just a responsible adult who helped take care of him while you were with his father.", "YTA.. Massively .. It takes a cold hearted woman to raise a child for his first three years of life and have no motherly love for him. You talk about him more as a pet that you had to feed and water rather than a family member. You was married to his father, That makes you his stepMOTHER. You are all he knows as a mum so when you had a baby he assumed that it was his sister, What would have been so wrong to let him think that? at least until he was old enough to understand better?

Your tone is cruel and so are your actions. \n\nFYI siblings aren't only blood some of my closest siblings I don't share a drop of blood with didn't even meet them until I was a teenager but bet your ass if someone said that's not my sister I'm tell going to them off", "What is wrong with people here being mean to kids??? \n\nTo be clear it\u2019s not even about the brother/ buddy thing but this kid didn\u2019t wake up one morning and got suddenly confused.\n\nYTA", "NTA you will get a lot of Y  T  A about being cruel because he's only little. But children need a very clear idea of who is who and who is related to who and in what way. Just like children need to be told they are adopted when they are little. We've all seen the delusions and fantasy's and false narratives parents have created in their young kid's head in order to, 'be kind' and it really screws them up long term, because they cannot ditch the false narratives and embrace the truth.", "YTA.\n\nMy stepmom decided to tell me out of the blue one day when I was maybe 5 that my brother was not me *real* brother because we had different dads.

I know you think you were being truthful, but if the kids consider themselves siblings there was honestly no reason to do this other than to get a petty jab in.", "YTA - You're projecting your anger that your ex cheated on you onto a 5yo! You can not be serious. What harm would it do if they were to consider each other siblings other than taking a hit to your own ego? Family is about more than just blood, and to try and break a 5 yo like this is absolutely absurd.", "Ugh...I'm not sure I can declare a sentence here. You say that you weren't a mother, and yet you cared for this child the entire first 3 years of his life and still watch him occasionally. It seems to me that he considered you to be his mother. And so, by extension, he considers your daughter to be his sister. You telling him that he was not her brother was basically you telling him he's not part of your family. I feel for that little boy.

Sure, it's gonna be hard for him to understand, but it would be MUCH more cruel to let him go on believing that untruth until he is even more attached to OP's daughter. Especially when OP said in a comment that the plan was to move out of the kid's life in three years. Better to set that boundary now than 3 years from now. Now the kiddo can adjust to the reality before they all leave his life. I really feel for Caden, though. He probably feels very unwanted atm.

While you mat not view yourself in that way, that doesn\u2019t mean HE hasn\u2019t. Especially when you still babysit him. I also wonder why OP would even still babysit for her ex at all.

His actions are those of a manipulative and selfish person. I understand your empathy for Caden, but you don't want to be his mother. So it's best if you walk away now.

Kids in orphanages may attach to caregivers there, but that doesn\u2019t turn the caregivers into mothers, or make their roles motherly. OP\u2019s relationship with this kid is wholly at the mercy of her ex. The child\u2019s mother is still alive, and a person, and might also object to OP stepping into a more matronly space. OP is kind to the little guy, but that\u2019s the most anyone can ask of her.", "No actually she wasn\u2019t. She included him in meals and took care of him when sick so the husband could work.

Why are you still interacting with this child that you don\u2019t consider yours instead of stepping back and giving your ex an opportunity to find a suitable caregiver? Why are you bringing your kid and your friends kid around this child to make such a distinction that they are siblings but he isn\u2019t? You don\u2019t have empathy. You seem to want to torment this kid for your husbands infidelity. This behavior is absolutely disgusting. Leave your ex and his child alone. They have enough to deal with because his biological mom is in a mental hospital. YTA.", "You aren't going to be able to set that boundary when your ex is telling the child the opposite. The longer the babysitting and being that adult in his life continues, the worse it's going to be for Caden in the long run", "My thoughts exactly. I currently have a 6 yr old and a 3 yr old so I know all too well what a kid at this age could understand. There's no way kids at this age could comprehend that their real mom is far away and this woman taking care of them isn't a mother figure. Real attachments have been made.", "I'm sad for this kid. They all are f... his mind.", "I didn't forget. The key point is that she's not there. This child has experience \"motherly care\" through OP. That's the only mother he actually knows and he's built that bond. A child under the age of 5 wouldn't understand the concept of a bio mom that's not in the picture.", "And she stipulated that she didn't act like a mother, you are aware parents occasionally stay with flatmates, hell I stayed with my dad and brother when I had mine, I can assure you that they do not get called dad.\n\nI stand by the Dad being the Ahole, it is heartbreaking that the kid is hurt but she doesn't consider herself the kids mum, end of.", "No, she\u2019s not living with him.

If the kids regard themselves as siblings, they\u2019re siblings and there\u2019s nothing wrong with having that relationship. \n\nAs the kids got older they probably would have started to notice subtle differences in their family dynamics vs. others\u2019 family dynamics and they probably would have started asking questions on their own. At that point the situation could have been addressed as a simple matter of genetic science *but* I would never advocate for insisting the kids weren\u2019t siblings if that\u2019s how they view themselves. My brother and I were not very close growing up and honestly that revelation from my stepmom was part of the reason. We\u2019re in a much better place as adults (and he is my real brother regardless of parentage), but that\u2019s a lot of years I missed out on a great relationship because an adult insisted on being right rather than nurturing and encouraging relationships.", "You've already confused him.

I think she downplayed her initial role in this child's life. If she was ambivalent to this child's existence then why continue to care for him after she left his father.

If OP\u2019s made it clear she\u2019s not Caden\u2019s mom, and there\u2019s no confusion that her ex is not her daughter\u2019s dad, then Caden will figure it out for himself that they\u2019re not blood related when he gets old enough to understand how parentage works (probably in just another 3-5 years). \n\nUnlike acknowledging a parental figure to a child (which may come with legal ramifications and adult messiness), there\u2019s no real negative to kids thinking of each other as siblings. Unless of course, OP means to distance herself and her daughter from Caden one day.
