You were fine.\n\nTheir frustration comes from shame.  They are ashamed that they raised someone that would miss their kid's birthday, they are ashamed that they raised someone that could abandon their kids, they are are ashamed that you clearly realize she is such a poor mom and partner - that they raised.\n\nSo in turn, they do the classic move - shoot the messenger.\n\nFocus on your kids, let the in-laws know that the wife will no longer be a topic of discussion for you, youndont need to waste your time and energy on that deadbeat.", "NTA. Your wife had not one but two affairs resulting in two babies, one which you have been told about and the other you have raised as your own.  She is the problem and not you. They should stop protecting her and pretending that she has done nothing wrong. You are not the bad guy here, she is. Tell her if they want to continue being part of the kids lives, none of this is up for discussion and they stop blaming you for her shortfalls as a wife and a mother.\n\nThey should be ashamed of their daughter.", "NTA but your mil sure is, her daughter cheated on you, and had two affair babies, one that she lied and told you was yours. They need to take their daughter off the pedestal they have her on. Their daughter is the issue. Not you.", "NTA - she cheated on you, lied about your child, and then seemingly abandoned you and your kids.  And MIL is in denial.  You're the only one who isn't an asshole here.", "How in the Hell are they mad at *you*, wtaf? Your wife made her choices, she clearly cares more about her new boyfriend than her partner of 18 years and three teenage kids (one of whom isn't even yours, and by the sounds of it you still treat her as if she is - if this is the case, kudos!), what do her parents have to be mad at you for? I don't blame you in the slightest for saying you regret marrying her, I would have too.\n\nBig NTA, I would wonder what lies your wife has told her family about you to where she can admit to cheating both 15 years ago and very recently, be pregnant with another man's child, completely abandon her family and run away interstate with another man, and your inlaws *still* somehow thinks you're the bad guy.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime to get some distance from the AH grandparents for yourself and the kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You are RIGHT: Lucie KNOWS her kid's birthsdays and is CHOSING to abandon her kids.", "Wait you still have custody of the child that's probably not yours? You're definitely NTA.", "NTA. How were you supposed to stop her? A chastity belt?", "NTA - their daughter is a massive AH and they're taking out their frustrations and anger on the wrong person.

But they cannot blame YOU for their grown daughter's choices. They need to see who she is. Until they do, I'd tell them visits will be short and you will not listen to them telling you that YOU\"RE the person at fault.", "NTA. She up and left. You\u2019re left holding the bag including dealing with HER parents. Good luck OP I hope you get a quick and painless divorce and can move on.", "NTA. Maybe its time for you to go LC or NC with the in-laws. They will almost always take the side of their child, regardless who's right or wrong. You're 100% in the right to feel how you feel. Your kidsbare old enough to understand what's going on and who's to blame. Just be honest with them without being bashful to the mom (if that makes sense) and offer counseling if needed. And I hope this doesn't change your relationship with Emily.", "NTA. First of all, good for you for making sure all of this was said away from the kids. They don\u2019t need to see the two of you getting into an argument. \n\nUltimately, your now ex is an adult an made her own decisions. You are incapable of making her do anything. I have a suspicion that MIL is dealing (badly) with guilt and the idea that the woman she raised is capable of doing this, and is not dealing with it well. As such, she is not only putting blame in the wing place, but she is lashing out at the nearest target available. \n\nIn any case, your feelings are completely understandable. I think any person in your position would feel the same way. People can yell at you all you want, but your MIL was being irrational and accusing you of not controlling things you had no ability to control. She needed a reality check.", "NTA.\n\nYour ex?-wife is a grown adult woman.  She makes her choices and she could have made the choice to celebrate the birthday, assuming she knew the date of the party.", "NTA - but boundaries need to be set with MIL. You need to tell her that she is welcome to spend time with her grandchildren but any mention of yours and your soon to be ex\u2019s relationship and you will ask her to leave. She needs to talk with her daughter if she wants to know more, that it was her daughters choice to end your marriage and you are not in a place to be able to discuss it further as it is very painful to you right now. That is the end of discussion and you will not engage any further with MIL. A nice polite note works if you don\u2019t want to actually speak to her. And get yourself a divorce lawyer.", "NTA \n\nAnyone would regret marrying her after what she did.", "NTA. Lucie is the only one responsible for her actions. You are one of the victims and so is Emily.  MIL is AH for attacking you when all of this is Lucie's fault. Lucie is the one who has chosen to turn her back on her children and her family, and that is the only person to blame. MIL needs to face this, stop attacking the wrong people, and stop doing this when the children are around. Their lives are in enough chaos, they need love and stability right now, not more family fighting.", "nta.", "NTA.\n\nYou were cheated on.

I am sure, you are glad for your kids and you would do it again. Don't let your MIL or your ex destroy your good memories.", "NTA. MIL needs to learn time and place and to put the blame where it belongs. Your (soon to be ex) wife cheated twice, the next thing she should get from you is divorce papers.", "NTA you kept your children out of it and said something in the heat of the moment. Regardless of if you actually feel that way it got the desired result.

You do deserve better.", "NTA\n\nMIL is most likely taking her anger out on you because she doesnt want to be angry at her daughter.   She would be wise to stay in your good graces, as you are the only parent still around and taking care of her 3 grandchildren.

I don't understand why your in-laws are not talking to their daughter to find out info and not you.", "Since the children didn't hear you, NTA. You aren't responsible for her behavior.", "NTA - your MIL needs to learn to put the blame in the right place. You and your boys are the victims of her daughter.

Cut that off now and let them know how much you love them how upsetting this situation is for you as well and although you feel destroyed by what their mother has done you have never regretted having them.

Communicate solely through text or email. Do nothing over the phone.", "NTA, my parents had a horrible relationship and my dad tells me all the time I was the only good thing that came from it. I\u2019m guessing you feel the same way, and maybe you can try that phrase from now on.

Ensure you get child support for your children going forward. Get a good lawyer.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t say all that in front of other people.

As long as you are not actively trying to stop her having contact with her and the kids can get in touch with her through mobile/internet and vise versa, then you are definitely not the AH. There is a lot of emotions to process here for both the kids and you, and you may need to look at some psychological support (kids have effectively been abandoned by their mother...) .

Your wife is a MAJOR Ahole.", "Gentle suggestion: it will be easier for your daughter to hear the phrase \u201cnot biologically mine\u201d or \u201c we\u2019re not biologically related\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not her biological father\u201d. She\u2019s yours, just not biologically.  I know that you clearly feel that way, but the words on the page without your tone of voice or your caring presence are much blunter.  I just have visions of her stumbling across this Reddit post and seeing \u201cshe\u2019s not mine\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m not her father\u201d over and over.  Someday she\u2019ll need assurances that she\u2019s always been and always will be yours, even if you\u2019re not biologically related.  You\u2019re doing amazing.  Definitely NTA.", "Have you actually had a DNA test though? Just because she cheated on you with someone doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re the dad. If she was sleeping with both of you at the same time it\u2019s a 50/50 chance. \n\nI think you\u2019re NTA though. She\u2019s just walked out on them kids and not even tried to get in touch to see them or do anything for their birthday. I don\u2019t know what kind of mother she is.", "You're so NTA. Her parents are blaming you for their daughters choices. Ignore them!", "How did you find out she wasn't yours? Did your wife tell you? Or did you get a dna test?", "And yet you're the one they claim isn't trying hard enough? They need to establish a better grip on reality. \n\nGood on you for looking after all three kids, regardless of the circumstances. Regarding Emily - I'd be inclined to seek legal advice about what rights you have now, before her mother decides to reappear. \n\nAlso NTA by the way.", "Um, there is a 99% chance you aren't going to end up on your own dateline episode, but....", "So have you filed for divorce yet or not?  Have you even consulted an attorney or are you still the same sucker you\u2019ve been for the last 14 years?", "OP, it goes without saying that you should at least be getting child support. Get a lawyer if you don't have one, get the divorce filed, and go after that child support for all 3 kids. And maybe limit contact with your ex in laws until this is all settled...", "I could be wrong, but I read it as Emily is an affair baby from 14 years ago and that Lucie is pregnant now with her current boyfriend's baby, who she ran off to live with.", "I'm assuming the new boyfriend is not the affair partner from 14 years ago", "Theyve been together 18 years, married for 14. She cheated around the time they got married and conceived the 13 year old daughter. She's now pregnant again but is unsure who the father is and has abandoned the family for her affair partner. There's nothing here to say that it's the same affair partner who fathered the daughter.", "You're missing the brand new affair baby on the way. Current AP may or may not also be the 13yo bio father, personally I don't think she'd have kept just one AP for so long.", "The timeline as I understand it...They met 18 years ago, she got preggers (with the two now-16 yr olds).  They got married when the children were 2 yrs old.  Wife had an affair a year after that.  The affair resulted in Emily.  Coast along for 13 years, wife has another affair.  doesn't say anywhere  that it was with the original AP.  In fact OP says it's a new boyfriend, so...", "Good call then I maintain NTA. I\u2019m very sorry about your situation and that your in laws are not helping your kids through this like they should be.", "I'd warn Emily if I were you. With her grandparents acting the way they are, I worry they'll drop the bomb on her when they can no longer get a rise out of you over their daughter's actions. Better the truth come from you than angry and hurt grandparents that no longer care who they hurt in their rage.", "Good! It\u2019s shocking how many people who get cheated on don\u2019t even think to get tested. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to think about it at all tho OP.", "Ok, got it. So she had two children with other men during your marriage - Emily and the new baby. NTA.", "Well, now you have learned, DNA doesn't permit assholes to be in your home.", "Not your issue anymore, but it sounds as though your wife is having some sort of episode - unless it's not as much of a 180 from her usual behaviour as I'm thinking... but it does sound like an extreme thing to do! A birthday card for daughter on sons birthday could be deliberate, but also feels like someone whose not quite with it.\n\nHope you gets lots of support and are looking after yourself - this sounds exhausting", "If he never married her, then he wouldn't have those kids. He would have kids, but not the exact one. \n\nSo that's pretty much saying he don't mind if he had different kids.", "I am glad at least that you recognize how damaging those words can be to a child. They just lost their mother, the least they need right now is to feel unwanted by their father.\n\nBest of luck to you. Even if you make mistakes, your kids are lucky to have you", "Kids know especially at that age!", "Yeah she\u2019s pretty terrible, wonder if she tries to run back to her family after things fall apart for her in new relationship ship", "Which he absolutely needs to do, he *should* be getting child support.", "She should be paying anyway", "True man right there.", "Maybe a bit earlier... but that should be discussed with a child psychologists. You hear all about adoption right now that you are supposed to sort of make sure they have always known they were adopted to make sure they are not traumatized etc.. \n\nI honestly think a therapist might not be a bad idea in general, I can't imagine these kids are not traumatized by their mom just up and leaving", "Yep i know but I don\u2019t even know how where to start.", "Emily\u2019s blood type isn\u2019t the same as mine and my wife\u2019s. I noticed it when she was in hospital. Then I got the dna test", "OP said in another comment they did get a DNA test", "He blood type isn\u2019t the same as me or my wife. We are both o and she is ab. Noticed it on her paperwork when she was in hospital for a broken arm. Then I got a dna test.

Him being married has no effect on if the kids existed. Think most people are able to understand that good can come from awful things, but it doesn't mean you can't wish you didn't go through that hurt", "My advice would be to give her the truth without editorializing. Don't badmouth her mother, but don't cover for her either. Pure, unvarnished truth. Answer every question. Reassure her that you love her.\n\nHonestly, enlisting the help of a professional would probably be a good move. You and your kids would probably benefit greatly from some therapy.", "Start with therapy for yourself and for all three of your kids.  I can't even imagine trying to process what you are going through, so treat yourself right and get some therapy to process it if you haven't already.  The kids are going to have to process that their mom apparently has abandoned them at the very least\n\nTalk to the therapist about Emily's situation and how and when it will be best to discuss it.  Roleplay the conversation with the therapist and the possible questions and reactions she might have.\n\nGood luck", "So you actually have had her DNA tested and it\u2019s come back 100% that you\u2019re not the father? Just trying to clarify.", "That's pretty damning...if you were both O, then you would have an O child... anything else would be an affair child... well unless one of you were a chimera, then there is a possibility of an A or a B child... but not an AB.. (I am reading it's possible for the AB, but more likely of a lab mixup)", "She can\u2019t be AB if your wife is type O. A or B, yes, but not both. Either she\u2019s neither of yours, you\u2019re misremembering, or this is all made up.", ">Think most people are able to understand\n\n\"most people\" here being the keyword. I agree with you. But what \"most people\" here understand is irrelevant.\n\nTry to explain that to kids that were just abandon by their mom and now learn that their dad said that.", "I am looking into therapy for them. I guess I am being selfish by not telling her and telling myself it was the best for her. Realistically I just don\u2019t want the risk of her saying she doesn\u2019t want me as a father anymore and just wants her mom.", "Yes there\u2019s no chance I\u2019m her father.", "We are definitely o. I might be wrong about Emily\u2019s blood type as that\u2019s what I thought it said but its definitely not o.", "\"most people\" here need to understand that the kids being born isn't the issue. The kids were Bron before the marriage. So saying \"I wish we never married\" doesn't change the kids he already had before marriage", "The opposite is far more likely to happen. She\u2019ll worry that *you* don\u2019t want *her* anymore, and that she\u2019ll lose the love of the one stable and reliable parent she has left.", "I get it. It's a lot easier to give that sort of advice when it's not your life and your child that you're worried about. That said, you cannot erase the harm that has been done by her mother, and you can't control your daughter's reaction or feelings, but you can model treating other people with enough respect to give them the truth.\n\nYou don't need to do it right now while you're still reeling. Do your best to come up with a plan for when the time comes.", "Get therapists for all your kids, but line up Emily's first. The older she gets, the worse she will take this news. It WILL knock her sense of identity out from under her. The longer you hide it, the more she will resent you for doing so. She's going to require a lot of reassurance and unconditional love.", "Seeing as her Mum can't be arsed to contact her kids, I'd say the chance of that happening are fairly low. But seeking professional advice on how to handle this sounds like the best move for you and your family, I wish you luck.", "Ok. Still NTA. I don\u2019t get why she hasn\u2019t talked to any of her kids, and the fact she\u2019s just abandoned the child who is your biologically. At least you still love her to not abandon her.", "I hope you don't mind me asking but what about the baby she is pregnant with now? She said she is pretty sure it is not yours but.. are YOU sure? I mean.. she lied to you about Emily for so long, could it be she is lying again because she rather wanted to run of with her new boyfriend without actually being sure? She hasn't exactly been trusthworthy. Are you planning to get a DNA test for the new baby or are you positive it's not yours?   \n\n\nAlso,.. clearly .. NTA", "And just like I said... it doesn't matter what You and I understand from it. What you say makes perfect sense. I get it. You are right.

You\u2019ve been there all her life, and I\u2019m trying to say that it\u2019s great that you\u2019re still her dad and being a good parent to her since her other parent has just abandoned her. I can\u2019t imagine what they kids are going through, and at least they still have you \ud83d\ude42", "I wish there were more fathers like you dude. Big NTA", "And that makes you a great man and father! We need more like you in this world.", "Ok, got it. At least you got clarity on that", "But it could happen. It's a very very strong possibility. Is it really a chance you want to take ? Tell someone that hates you a harsh thing and expect that they won't blab to other people ?\n\nJust because it didn't happen don't make it right. Just like driving in a daycare courtyard blindfolded is a very bad idea, and the fact that you didn't hit any toddler doesn't make it ok either.", "Sorry I knew you weren\u2019t. I was just saying how I feel", "But the person that hates you will blab and claim that you did hit a toddler? What are you even saying now \ud83d\ude02"]}
