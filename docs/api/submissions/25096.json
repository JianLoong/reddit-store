People can end relationships but still deeply care for eachother. The primary focus should be your sons well being. I would explain your concerns to her and just ask her that in a period of the next two weeks to clear out what she needs and that if she wants to come by the house to pickup or spend time with your guys\u2019 son that she needs to give a heads up.  But I\u2019m js if she\u2019s spending time in someone\u2019s room- she\u2019s probably having some type of relationship with him.

Think about that, you're co-parenting and want to ruin your relationship with ex completely.\n\nThat being said, if your ex is interfering with the custody arrangement by showing up, that needs to stop. The first step is to have a sit down with your ex and explain it very clearly she is not to interfere.

If it isn't, I'd strongly consider putting in a lockable door.\n\nAlso, if the house situation settled or does she still have rights of access as a resident/co-owner? Because if she doesn't, I'd give her a firm deadline on packing her stuff, and if she missed that I'd pack it myself, hire one of those pods and leave it in that. Costs money but less disruptive for your kid."]}
