When our sons were born, my wife was on maternity leave for about a year. We discussed her being a SAHM but she didn't want to do it because she's a very extroverted person and she finds a lot of fulfillment from her job so we agreed to put our boys into daycare. We make about 150k between us so money isn't much of an issue.\n\nMy work gets over at around 5pm while my wife's gets done at around 7pm so I take over much of the childcare when I'm done with work. My wife for the most part is a good mom and spends time with our kids on the weekends and reads them bedtime stories when she gets back home from work. However, the problem is she doesn't do enough whenever we are out at family parties.\n\nMy wife has a pretty large extended family that lives close by and they have get togethers 1-2 times a month for us all to hang out. Most of them are nice people. My wife is also really close with them. But she never helps with the kids during those parties. Whenever we go, I have to be the one who has keep an eye on them to make sure they're staying out of trouble. During meal times, it's on me to make sure both of them eat because my wife is too busy chatting or playing beer pong with her cousins. She sees me feeding them and struggling to get them to sit in one place but she doesn't bother to help or even offer to get me a drink or some food. Often times, I end up eating the cold leftovers because the kids so darn long to finish eating. I can't even converse much with the people over there because of it.\n\nI've talked to her many times about her pulling her weight or at least giving me a break. She'll supervise them for around 20 minutes and then revert to old habits so the entire load falls on my shoulders eventually. I finally had enough and told her we either need to hire a babysitter or I'm staying at home with the kids for the upcoming get togethers. She says it's wrong to keep the kids from seeing their family and vice versa. I told her I don't care and I deserve better than being her glorified babysitter who can't even let loose every once in a while. I told her she has to make a choice.\n\nShe got upset and started crying because it's her dad's 60th birthday this weekend. She complained to her sisters and they're now blowing up my phone calling me an asshole and saying I need to stop being so selfish.

One of the reasons we are now divorced. My family live to far away so we rarely saw them but his family I\u2019d end up watching the kids on a farm while he played with his siblings (all adults) he didn\u2019t understand the problem. Do you think she would watch them if you sent the kids with just her? Can you trust her to parent around her family if your not there? I\u2019d send them with her this weekend. My ex husband is fully capable of watching the kids while with his family if I\u2019m not there (which clearly I\u2019ll never go back). Funny how that worked.", "You\u2019re going about this all wrong. Next time be busy on the party day. Have other plans. She can take the kids and then realize how it\u2019s been for you. Your wife is being selfish. She also needs to handle your marriage like an adult, listen to your concerns, and stop tattling to her family. They all need to butt out of your marriage. NTA", "Your wife is behaving badly.  She knows it and you know it.  \n\nI would suggest that you make a plan to do something with friends or solo, no kids, leaving early before wife can stick you with the kids, during the next several family bashes.  Tell your wife that you find the situation untenable, and that therefore you're not going to subject yourself to it again until she's had the same opportunity she's provided you to watch the children during the family get togethers.\n\nWhen you decide to give it another try, if she still doesn't do her fair share, stop attending for an even longer period.  You don't need this, why should be go through it?\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThe next time a sister calls you, ask them how this is even their business.   And yes, you are being treated as child care during parties.  If you want to stay home, do so, but the kids can go with her and she can always watch them.", "NTA.  She can take the kids solo to the gatherings, I think her father's 60th is the prime opportunity for her to start.  You have tried talking to her about this, she won't change.  So it's up to you how you move forward.", "NTA have you tried telling her to take the kids to the family get togethers while you stay home?  Or plan something with your friends that happens at the exact same time as her family event.  It isn\u2019t fair that she is ruining these events for you and I don\u2019t blame you for wanting to change the behavior.", "NTA you aren\u2019t keeping the kids from her dads party, she\u2019s more then welcome to take them without you. I too would stay home, it\u2019s not worth it. She sounds immature and needs to realize she doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose when to be a mom.", "NTA.\n\nLet her take the kids to the party by herself while you stay home if that is an option?\n\nEdit: Fixed auto correct.", "NTA. But don\u2019t say you will keep the kids with you let her take the kids and you stay home. \u2018Call in sick\u2019. Say sorry the babysitter can\u2019t work today please find other arrangements and then go out with mates or something and turn your phone off.", "NTA.

Let her see what it is like without you there for backup.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nYour wife is being selfish and inconsiderate. You both work full-time, so you should be sharing childcare responsibilities equally. However, it sounds like she is expecting you to do all the work, even when you are out at social events.\n\nI'd skip the family social occasionally and let her go with the kids.", "NTA, especially since it is HER family events and you really don't even have to go to them. Tell her she is free to go and take the kids with her. Let her deal with them on her own for a night. Maybe things will change. Right now she knows she as an out, because she knows you will step up and take care of the kids.  \n\n\nAs nice as they may be on other occasions, the family is also A Hs in this situation. I have a large family. We would never watch a parent struggle to take care of ONE kid, let alone *TWO*. Someone would step in to help. But your SILs call to harass you, instead of volunteering to watch the kids if you came (which of course they wouldn't, but . . .).", "Your wife is the AH. She literally told her family so that they would harass you into going. I would have her take the kids alone or see if their are older cousins family members that are willing to babysit while at the party.  We have a lot of extended family and get together often but all the kids play together and the entire family keeps an eye on all of them but we also have older cousins around usually just sitting around that would be willing to babysit usually for free but I wouldn\u2019t mind paying them tbh if they would watch them the entire time.", "NTA. Let her take the kids to her fathers bday, you stay home or go out.  Let her deal with reality without you.  When she calls to come and help plus see her family, tell her you can\u2019t make it and your out.", "Nta, me and partner each take a child at family gatherings. We only have both when other is eating. I would tell her you will go if she stays in charge of one kid. If she stops then you three will leave early. \n\nIts all speaks volumes that your in laws dont help. They obviously dont have to but if it is so important the kids be there then why not help a struggling parent.", "NTA. But don't keep the kids home. Let her take them to her family events without you for a while. You get a break, and she can see for herself how much work it is doing it by herself. Hopefully, she learns from it.", "NTA. If you\u2019re unhappy and nannying at these events, drop her and the kids off and pick them up after.", "NTA. Honestly, tell her to take the kids to her dads party.. but You stay home. Let her see how much work it actually is while you get a much deserved break.", "Wow, you're a housewife, circa 1940s-2010. In no circumstance does this make you a 'babysitter.' You're the only parent paying attention, sadly. \n\nNTA. Total bummer.", "NTA. That\u2019s plainly unfair and lopsided. Those solutions you offered makes sense, maybe explore some other ones (is there a family member there that would enjoy being on kid duty?) but keep advocating for yourself.", "NTA but why can't you let her take the kids by herself and you stay home?", "NTA\n\nIf you both work full time jobs, child care when you are all together should be split equally, including when at family functions.", "NTA sounds like her sisters are volunteering to do the babysitting at the party to me. You can go, and if you are finding the same thing happening, dump the boys in her lap and leave, so you're no longer an option. Or just don't go, but do draw the line.", "NTA\n\nNext time the sisters contact you, ask if there is an older cousin you can pay to watch the boys?\n\nThat way, you will get to enjoy the party.  Your wife and you will both be there if the sitter needs help.\n\nIf you pay one of the older cousins, make sure you have cash and don't be stingy.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA. Send her with the kids. You stay home. This solves 2 problems. Her dad gets to see them and you get a break.", "NTA. I have a TON of nieces and nephews, as well as younger cousins. If their parents are having a hard time with them, someone else in the family always steps in to help. That's just what you're supposed to do. Not just leave someone in the lurch like that.", "NTA. Join her at the party, and find an excuse to step away after a little while. Get delayed and leave them in her care for as long as possible. \n\nHonestly, and not to take away from your issue, I always found kids impossible at parties. They're too excited with cousins and noise to sit and eat. Our family rule is adults eat while the kids are still playing, and then we serve them hot food after. It's much easier than sitting alone with cold leftovers.", "Nta. Next time, just constantly send the kids back to her and disappear.", "NTA- sounds like you are right in that your wife expects to be able to drop the kids on you\u2026 and getting her family involved is an AH move on its own\u2026", "You've just described most mother's lives at social events. But it doesn't make it right just because the genders are swapped, it's *always* been messed up to have one parent do everything and the other slacks off.\n\nNTA", "Beer pong. At a family party. With her toddlers present. Yeah, that\u2019s an easy NTA.", "NTA at all. I come from a huge family with 22 cousins, and those 22 eventually started having babies. So babies at family parties are very familiar and they take a lot of work! And you have to help each other out, so both of you can socialize a bit, eat a decent meal, relax, go to the bathroom, etc, etc, etc. Your wife is selfish and not a very nice person, at least in this respect. Maybe she is okay in the other areas. But your husband and babies are at the very core of your life, so why would you do this?\n\nEdit: Question: does nobody else in her large family offer to help?\n\nAnother edit: I missed the part where you suggested hire a babysitter for when you go to family parties. This is a solution! Or even a baby sitter who can go with you to the parties, so the babies can still meet the relatives but someone else can help with childcare.", "Say \"oh I'm not saying you and the kids aren't going. I'm going to pass, though. I am sure you can handle the kids for a few hours while you celebrate.\"", "Just hire a babysitter for next event. You can do it!", "NTA. Having small children is hard. Hire a babysitter. Have fun with your wife and family. Pursue counseling for communication. And have a talk with her family about how you feel about struggling, if they are as family oriented as they sound, they will support you both in your marriage.", "No.\n\nBut why don\u2019t you hire a nanny just for grandpa\u2019s party? They can meet you, then go with you/follow you to the party, then look after the kids?", "NTA. But I guess now you know how 99% of wives feel in your situation!", "ESH\n\nShe is not being considerate. And she should not have sicced her family on you. You could perhaps use a nicer tone.\n\nMost couples switch duties depending on whose family is present, but it doesn't balance in your case. \n\nSo hire a babysitter/bring her with you or ask her to ask her sisters for help, too. Or, since she doesn't want them to stay home, feel sick next time and let her take them by herself.\n\nShe can't have it both ways.", "YTA \n\nShe works 2 hours a day more than you which means she\u2019s works 10 hours more a week than you \n\n\nShe needs time off to relax and you need to be a better husband \n\nHire a babysitter at these family events so you both can relax but personally she needs it more than you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you keep this up, you will become bitter and there is no coming back from that.\nMake a schedule. You have child duty for one child each during dinner. You have child duty one hour each during the evenings. Things like that. You are a team and she has to function as a team member.", "NTA. My sis and her husband are great at this; they\u2019re a team so they sort of tag in and out so each can get a chance to have adult time, eat, and catch up. It\u2019s a good strategy. You guys are partners; it\u2019s not fair to you as it is.", "NTA\n\nYour wife wants to let loose, that's fair, but why drag you along? So she doesn't get shit from her family for not bringing her kids? So her kids can see the family but she doesn't have to take care of them? \n\nShe's probably upset because you're pretty spot on by the \"glorified babysitter\" comment.", "NTA. I had a similar issue as every time I turned around I was the designated child minder while everyone else was able to relax and enjoy themselves. One day I was not in the mood for the crap so I walked over and quite unceremoniously plopped the toddler onto my then SO's lap interrupting him in mid conversation. When he started to complain I stated for all to hear that I was tired, hot, hadn't eaten, and hadn't had so much as a drink of water since we got there and his \"just give me 5 minutes\" was over an hour ago. After that it was a lot easier for everyone to pay attention to all the kiddos instead of just me. Sometimes you need to hold a mirror up to people and show them who is truly the selfish ones.", "NTA twins are hard work and it just isn't ok that 1 parent is doing more of their fair share.", "Jesus Christ your wife is selfish as hell. It's no surprise her sisters have her back, but screw em honestly. Next time one of these delightful gatherings is supposed to take place, be busy on that day and let her take the kids by herself if it's so damn important to her.", "NTA for miles. If you were the mother and she the father in this sort people would rightly be calling him lazy and rude and inconsiderate. Do not allow your wife to treat you like this. It\u2019s like this because you have allowed it. Don\u2019t.", "It's not babysitting when they are your own kids. \n\nThat said, what is she doing at these parties that prevents her from keeping an eye on her children?", "She can take the kids without you, end of.

Your wife isn't just extroverted. She wanted every excuse she could have NOT to watch the kids and do the most minimal effort of raising them.\n\nShe can cry all she wants but honestly, if it's THAT important to her she should be willing to get the sitter or help out with the kids during those family meet ups.", "NTA\n\nBut i don't see a reason why you and the kids stay home, especially if you need a break. \n\nJust tell her oc the kids should see family, this was a dumb suggestion of yours. She should oc take them with her, but you will be skipping every second family party from now on (maybe start with the one after the bday). \n\nI don't see how she could complain about that. When you will be there she will leave you with childcare anyway, but when you stay home enjoying you time she will have to watch them herself. You oc can be nice and let her know if she doesn't want to take them she can leave them with you. \n\nSo your mess up here was to tell her you will stay home with the kids instead only you staying home and i have no idea why you would even suggest keeping the kids home in the first place, it makes no sense.", "NTA\nIt's ok. You can let her have a taste of motherhood during her father's 60th.\nSo when you head over and she gets her 20 minutes of mom-hood. Long before she gets any idea of pawning them off on you, just disappear. Go for a long walk in the neighborhood and simply be unavailable. Or just drink a lot and pretend to be too drunk to take care the kids safely. You have to make it less compelling for her to want you to have the kids. Probably just disappearing is good enough if you know she's going to pawn them off. You're going to get cold food anyways so the food issue won't matter. And they all think you are an AH now by the sound of it. So, you might not be as welcomed as you think. Take advantage of that moment and just take off for a while. Maybe take a drive to Starbucks and read a book. Enjoy your free time.\n\nSometimes you need to take what you want and not ask. If she complains then she complains; that's life. Grab your free time once in a while like she grabs hers. Being married I've learned there are some battle worth fighting. Once upon a time my wife tried to intimidate me by throwing stuff, and I knew that if it happened it would possibly be a tool that she'll keep using to get the same effect. I've seen so many sorry abused guys at work and I wasn't going to join them. I just joined her into throwing stuff around laughing and eventually I broke something important of hers and it stopped. That's crazy meeting crazy. In your case, have fun with your free time and when she complains you chat. And if she keeps doing it, dump the kids on her at the most inconvenient times for her and grab your free time when you can. If she likes to spend time at her parents house, just get your free time while you're there. You might not be available to chat with others, but surely it's better than being a doormat. Right? After a while she'll get the picture. She won't forget anymore, that's for sure. \nBTW, you don't ever need the ultimatum. Bad behaviors can be sorted out by being clever and letting her get a taste of the her own medicine.", "NTA. Sounds like kids are an accessory to her. Spending time with kids alone doesn't make a parent. \n\nReally? Beer pong? .... \n\nAnyway. Not sure why she had kids if she wasn't going to actually take care of them. \n\nGood for you for the ultimatum. It's not like anyone was seeing them anyway.", "Honestly in my opinion a mom of twins myself your are nta. She should be pulling the same amount of wait you are pulling at those events to make it more enjoyable for you too", "NTA. But please call it 'parenting all by yourself, while she is there too' instead of 'babysitting'. \n\nIt is horrible to watch over more than 1 small child in someone elses home, because the house is different, not kid-proof the way you are used too and you don't want your kids to damage other people's stuff.\n\nTell the family members that blow up your phone. It's not you, it's your wife who refuses to do her share - and apparently, family members aren't helping out either, so...", "NTA. I normally don't like when people give ultimatums, but holy batpeg Batman! My husband and I have a thing where one parent eats and the other feeds the kids (4 years and 5 months), and as soon as the first parent is done eating, we switch. \n\nI would say let her take the kids. You do something you like to do. Wouldn't be surprised, though, if she stays at your in-laws after the parties. \n\nThere was a parent class I went to that said, \"The child comes first.\" it meant that you have to take care of yourself in order to take care of your little ones. Take time to relax a bit and come back better for your kiddos. Good luck.", "NTA\n\nYou are not selfish, have her take the kids on her father's 60th's while you stay home.

If she refuses, then she's the one keeping the kids away from the family and you can simply reply that to her family", "How about you stay home for much needed relaxation and make her take the kids to play beer pong with her family? Doesn\u2019t her family notice her obvious neglect for her children at these parties? Her sisters are blowing up your phone and calling you an AH? Not cool. You tell them all how selfish THEY are. (Oh, and as a side note - you\u2019re not a babysitter when they\u2019re your kids but I get how you\u2019re feeling as such). Seriously, except for the 60th birthday celebration - do it but ffs let the kids run amok and enjoy yourself and let HER be responsible for a change.

I used to work with a family and they only ever hired me for the get togethers so mom and dad could both let loose while the babies were seen to and also got to play with cousins. When being capable or independent it can be difficult because no one really ever considers if you need something. Your wife might not realize you need help regardless of the talks idk I won't presume. But it honestly sounds as though she may not be a traditional wife and so doesn't want to be categorized as such and that being the case her extending the courtesies and partnership might do that.", "NTA but just don't go so she has to look after them.\n\nBut also how immature is your wife that she involves her family in your disputes. Guess she gets her way on most things.", "Get called away for at the next party leave her no choice to be there for the kids because you are gone. \n\nwhat she doing is a weird power play isn't it? What is she gaining  by this behavior  how well do you get along with her side of the family?

Or, drive separately and when the kids start acting up/getting out of hand. Or, tell her it\u2019s her turn to watch her kids and leave the party. If she finds it embarrassing, too bad.", "It's telling that you refusing to go to a party means the kids don't see her family. It's so easy to just take the kids by herself but that wasn't even a thought in her head. NTA", ">Do you think she would watch them if you sent the kids with just her? \n\nThis is what I'm wondering. \n\n>Can you trust her to parent around her family if you're not there?\n\nI think she's trustworthy for sure--OP says she's a good mother. She just doesn't want to parent when she's with her family. \n\nWe can't know, but if OP does send her and the kids to the parties without him, I think she'll hang out with her family (but no Beer Pong, I would assume, if she's gotta drive herself and kids) and let another member of her large family take over. \n\nThe whole thing is weird. I can see wanting to blow off steam, but she sees her family one or two dozen times a year for fun and relaxation. Why does she insist on not being a parent when her kids are *right there*?", "Absolutely this. Boggles my mind folks like this exist\n\nShe\u2019s more than welcome to take them without you. I too would stay home, OP is not keeping them from it. She sounds really immature and needs to realize she doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose when to be a mom.", "Just send the kids over with her and stay home / do your own thing. NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve no kids myself but I\u2019m the eldest of the eldest and I\u2019ve seen either my mom or dad get stuff / feed the partner / switch for eating. I\u2019ve seen it with my uncles and aunts too. Hell, just this weekend my brother and his wife did.", "NTA, but are the kids seeing the family or is OP just taking care of the kids so that the wife can see her family. Th wife does not seem to realize what having kids means and she is just carrying over from her previous life and dumping it on OP. Since both are well off, why not hire a babysitter for the party location itself. If the family want to see. they can.", "This is the way to solve this.\n\nOP needs to stop giving the wife a choice in this situation. Until he actually puts his foot down nothing is going to change.", "Make it look like a last minute decision if you do follow this plan", "The amount of people who put their business out there is mind boggling. People really are okay with family calling their spouses? I'd be mortified.", "\u201cFood poisoning\u201d is an excellent last-minute reason to stay home\u2026", "Bit extreme", "I held/fed one of my baby cousins at the last big family get together I was at. It meant the Mum could eat her lunch while the Dad and Grandad took turns minding the toddler and eating their own lunches. What sort of family doesn't help each other?", "Or why doesn\u2019t OP\u2019s wife just be a parent every now and again?", "Because to need a nanny is insane. Two parents should be able to do this.", "A nicer tone? After speaking with her nicely multiple times?", "How did you come to the conclusion she works 2 hours more?????\n\nMaybe her schedule is from 10-7, making it a normal 8 hour day.", "Actually it means she does 10 less hours a week parenting than him", "Where does it say her hours? Maybe her day starts 2 hours later?\n\nHow do you know she needs it more? He does everything.", "1. No one said anything about \"more\" hours. It is very likely she just has a later start time.\n\n2. He is not \"relaxing\" in the 2 hours it takes for her to come home. He is looking after their kids. If that's your criteria for his wife needing reparations, she already owes OP a massive debt for getting to \"relax\" for a full year while OP was working 9 hours daily more than her.", "Auto-correct is extreme. I'll edit.\n\nThanks.", "Yeah, I\u2019m child free and have very little experience with kids but I was delighted to hold my niece and nephew when they were younger so my sister and BIL could eat and get a bit of a break. \n\nNTA. Send her and the kids to the next  say 3 gatherings while you do something else. Meet up with friends, go to the movies alone even. But let her carry the burden for a while. Then go to an event with her and see if she\u2019s got it together. If she has, great! If she hasn\u2019t, or if she starts to slip back into old habits after a while, send her alone again, this time for 5 consecutive events. Rinse and repeat until she gets it or you\u2019ve gotten a sufficient break.", "In this story he isn't treated like family. More like the babysitter who is threatening to quit.", "No don't! It cracked me up!", "Now I want to know what it originally said . . .", "Instead of an option it read adoption option (which sometimes on reddit i wouldn't be surprised)", "Lmao"]}
