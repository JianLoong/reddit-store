Also, if his parents are adults in their right minds, why in the world would you disrespect them and play pretend during holidays?

Probably not. Plus if they ever find out you were divorced long before they knew, that will probably make it worse.", "NTA. Better a hard truth than a soft lie. Especially if your ex is currently trying to get money from his parents for something that you both know isn't going to happen.", "NTA. I can understand not wanting to cause stress at a family event like Christmas dinner, but they were going to find out sooner or later.", "You're NTA. Being elderly doesn't mean they need to be shielded from the truth. They're adults, not small children. Treating them like children is disrespectful and insulting.", "NTA they were going to find out eventually.

Actively maintaining a lie (potentially so they might give your ex money) is cruel.", "NTA, you can't go wrong with the truth.  It seems to me that your ex was trying to pull something over on them.  I can't figure out what could be gained by pretending to be a happy family whilst divorcing.", "NTA It's better that you stop their hopes of surrogacy sooner rather than later. Sadly there's never a good time to break the news about a divorce. And telling people about the divorce and seeing what your new life is going to look like is part of the healing process. It hurts more to live in a lie.", "NTA you have every right to tell EVERYONE what's happening in your life, regardless of what his desires are.

At this rate you\u2019ll be remarried with kids and still popping up at his parents in holidays pretending to be still together", "NTA. I can understand not wanting to share news about yr divorce w/everyone, but when it comes down to lying about it and pretending yr still a couple \u2014 no. Your ex dragged you into his lies. They were going to find out eventually, weren't they? Better to be upfront about it.", "NTA", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand the point in hiding the truth of the matter. Do you have suspicions that he was asking them to fund the surrogacy?", "NTA", "Of course they\u2019re devastated, you\u2019re their son (in-law) who they care about very much. This is a break up for them as much as it is for you. But they need to know, and it sounds like your ex has some not very nice reasons for lying to them, good for you for doing what you think is right.", "NTA at all. A divorce is really not a secret. It may be something you choose to disclose together or decide how you want to disclose jointly, but at the end of the day, it is information that belongs to both of you and you have every right to make unilateral decisions about who you tell. Lying by exclusion is still lying - someone who cheated on you certainly knew that.", "NTA he should\u2019ve told them.", "Perhaps he thought they would fork over the money before the divorce is final so he can keep it to himself??  But anyway, you are NTA", "They are in relative good health. They aren\u2019t frail but my father in law is diabetic and my mother in law has hypertension. However, they are very active and heathy and despite that they\u2019re very active in the community.", "He had an affair and probably fears that I\u2019ll mention why we got divorced. I\u2019m not that petty.", "Maybe ex is still hoping for that big chunk of the 200k his parents were going to give for surrogacy.", "Wouldn\u2019t put it past him to try. Lying is one of his many traits.", "This right here! He was going to tell them shortly after he told them \u201cThe IVF didn\u2019t work\u201d", "A month", "Yes they were going to find out. As much as I love them I won\u2019t be able to maintain my relationship with them post divorce. Neither will my sister but that\u2019s up to her. It\u2019s sad they\u2019ll be losing a grandchild.", "Ah. Well it sounds like it is really his own problem. Telling the truth definitely doesn't make you TA. Best of luck on your life without him \ud83d\udc9b", "You sound like you are doing more than most people.  A lot would go scorched earth if their partner cheated.", "Tell your ex it sucks to suck", "It's not petty to tell the truth.", "ESH. I don\u2019t think you should have been the 1 to tell them and I don\u2019t think a month is an unreasonable time frame to not have told them. Your ex is being unreasonable in expecting you to lie to people and pretend you\u2019re still together.", "NTA but tell them exactly why your getting divorced. Anything that happens is because of your ex", "NTA. You told your soon to be ex husband family the truth. Your soon to be ex husband is the asshole here for wanting you to lie too everyone that just manipulative. Like what did your ex expect for you to do take his family money for a surrogacy that is not happening.", "NTA, sounds like your ex is trying to drag this out as long as he possibly can, stop giving in to his stupid demands and tell to the people you need to tell that you're getting divorce.", "op=NTA\n\nyes, they deserved to know the truth.\n\nAnd your soon-to-be legally Ex is trying to con/manipulate someone.  And since they seem fixated on the surrogacy, I'm betting your Ex was trying to get money out of them before your separation became known.", "NTA. Lying is so stressful.", "You\u2019re in the midst of a divorce and yet your STBX wants to hide this from your friends and his family, even to the extent of pretending that you\u2019re still together. Is he hoping that the divorce won\u2019t happen?\n\n I think you need to bite the bullet and start telling people the truth. A simple letter or some form of written message sent out that plainly states that sadly you have irreconcilable differences and have decided to part ways. Yes, this will make people sad but they will be more upset if they discover that you have been lying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI have a sick feeling he was going after \"surrogacy\" money for himself, and you ruined his plans.", "NTA.  If you are already in the midst of divorce proceedings, they have to be told at some point.  I think they will feel more respected if they are told sooner rather than later.  Their disappointment won't be less later.", "Anyone else feel like he was pretending to get his parents to give them a shit ton of money for a child that isn't happening. NTA", "I am confused about how you could be the asshole for not pretending to be married to him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your Ex is trying to shake them down for \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3", "They can deal fine. Their generation was scandalous af. I seriously don\u2019t get coddling elders from news who have seen way more than most.", "You should be petty. Cheaters deserve nothing.", "Could be he planned on taking the surrogacy money and using it for himself\u2026", "You should be, steal his inheritance\ud83d\ude08", "Bingo! Well, not your fault. You told the truth. NTA.", "I would. Because otherwise he\u2019s going to tell them that you cheated.", "Oh Lord. Darlin\u2026you deserve SO much better. It was kind of you to go along with his charade initially, but come on? I\u2019m generally an optimist, but I\u2019m thinking he was counting on the financial help intended for the surrogate to support himself?\n\nBest of luck, wish you all the happiness in the world!"]}
