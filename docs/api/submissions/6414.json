Do you have suspicions that he was asking them to fund the surrogacy?", "NTA", "Of course they\u2019re devastated, you\u2019re their son (in-law) who they care about very much. This is a break up for them as much as it is for you. But they need to know, and it sounds like your ex has some not very nice reasons for lying to them, good for you for doing what you think is right.", "NTA at all. A divorce is really not a secret. It may be something you choose to disclose together or decide how you want to disclose jointly, but at the end of the day, it is information that belongs to both of you and you have every right to make unilateral decisions about who you tell.

I don\u2019t think you should have been the 1 to tell them and I don\u2019t think a month is an unreasonable time frame to not have told them. Your ex is being unreasonable in expecting you to lie to people and pretend you\u2019re still together.", "NTA but tell them exactly why your getting divorced. Anything that happens is because of your ex", "NTA. You told your soon to be ex husband family the truth. Your soon to be ex husband is the asshole here for wanting you to lie too everyone that just manipulative. Like what did your ex expect for you to do take his family money for a surrogacy that is not happening.", "NTA, sounds like your ex is trying to drag this out as long as he possibly can, stop giving in to his stupid demands and tell to the people you need to tell that you're getting divorce.", "op=NTA\n\nyes, they deserved to know the truth.\n\nAnd your soon-to-be legally Ex is trying to con/manipulate someone.

Lying is so stressful.", "You\u2019re in the midst of a divorce and yet your STBX wants to hide this from your friends and his family, even to the extent of pretending that you\u2019re still together. Is he hoping that the divorce won\u2019t happen?\n\n I think you need to bite the bullet and start telling people the truth. A simple letter or some form of written message sent out that plainly states that sadly you have irreconcilable differences and have decided to part ways. Yes, this will make people sad but they will be more upset if they discover that you have been lying. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI have a sick feeling he was going after \"surrogacy\" money for himself, and you ruined his plans.", "NTA.  If you are already in the midst of divorce proceedings, they have to be told at some point.  I think they will feel more respected if they are told sooner rather than later.  Their disappointment won't be less later.", "Anyone else feel like he was pretending to get his parents to give them a shit ton of money for a child that isn't happening.

Their generation was scandalous af. I seriously don\u2019t get coddling elders from news who have seen way more than most.", "You should be petty.

You told the truth. NTA.", "I would. Because otherwise he\u2019s going to tell them that you cheated.", "Oh Lord. Darlin\u2026you deserve SO much better. It was kind of you to go along with his charade initially, but come on? I\u2019m generally an optimist, but I\u2019m thinking he was counting on the financial help intended for the surrogate to support himself?\n\nBest of luck, wish you all the happiness in the world!", "NTA - I read where you say in the comments that he cheated on you so that's why you guys are getting a divorce. He mad you told him because they are going to wonder why and he now has to figure out what to tell them. He now has to say thanks Mom and Dad for giving me all that money to try to have a kid with my partner while I was running around on him. He wants you to keep your mouth shut and not tell anyone for his own selfish benefit because it will make his life easier...I wouldn't worry about him.\n\nIt's really not your fault he cheated and you can't keep pretending to be \"Happy Couple\" when you aren't. You deserve to be able to tell your family and friends when you wish, heal and move on from this.", "NTA\n\nThey sound like lovely people and if it\u2019s not a struggle for you (and they don\u2019t try to get you two back together), there\u2019s no reason to not let them stay in your life if they want to. I have an aunt who married into the family and when her husband divorced her (I believe he was cheating), the family kept her instead. \n\nThat said, by denying you the ability to talk to anyone about it, he is isolating you, controlling the narrative, and manipulating you. The divorce is because of his actions- he lost the right to have you do anything for his sake. It\u2019s time to come out of the closet about your divorce to everyone and get the support you deserve.", "NTA. You aren't divorcing them, just him.  His discomfort with truth is probably part of that. You don't have to lie about yourself to make other people happy.", "Something is definitely not right about this. My parents were the first ones I told, both times. Both sets of parents should be told. NTA", "NTA, he's lucky you're as generous as you are. I would absolutely not play the happy couple if my husband had an affair.", "10 bucks says your stbx planned to pocket the surrogacy money then tell his parents it \"fell through\" but with them being alerted of the divorce they are not going to give him the money, thats why he is angry.", "Has he taken some of the money for the surrogacy already, without telling you and used it for something else? I can't think of another reason why he'd want to hide this rather thN get support from his family.", "NTA. How long does he really expect you to keep this up?", "NTA but why is he hiding a divorce", "It\u2019s been on my mind but the idea of still having him in my life even by proxy is difficult. My sister is contemplating her relationship with his parents now because they love her and the baby. I think I need a lot of time and space to get comfortable with them.", "Ironically he pretends to care because our divorce will put my sister in a difficult position as well because his parents have grown fond of her and her baby.", "I don\u2019t know he might have.", "He's being such an asshole, you SHOULD BE PETTY!", "Yes that\u2019s been the hard part. His manipulation despite our separation.", "Yes or get money out of them in some other way, inheritance, their will etc.", "Likely till after the divorce is finalised", "I\u2019m assuming to get money out of them", "Mentioning his affair is not petty. It is a relevant reality and he will almost certainly try to throw you under the bus. I would not be at all surprised if your friends and family all think this divorce is over your affair, because your ex will tell them that. You might want to get ahead of that.", "And that is why you split. Not because he was a cheater but because you couldn't with not having children. A nice financially useful and face saving narrative if he could keep the cat in the bag.\n\nNTA - you probably stopped his elderly relatives being scammed by him taking money under false pretences.", "And that is completely valid. Seriously. It is so valid. Right now, you should already be working on that processing, but your ex has been further damaging you by asking you to pretend. He\u2019s an ass. I hope you\u2019re able to do some self care soon.", "That's a big ask, and you certainly don't owe it to him", "I\u2019ve shown him that I was hurt and betrayed and nothing came out of that aside from more hurt and betrayal. If I show him I care he\u2019ll think he\u2019s worth caring about.", "That\u2019s what I suspected as well or he wanted money for them in some other way.", "NTA. That's terrible that he wants to keep it a secret (and absurd - at some point it has to come out, or does he intend to maintain this charade indefinitely?). You need your support system while you are going through this. Tell whoever you need to talk to about your feelings. Best wishes.", "NTA.  He's playing his parents for money: not your problem.\n\nHe cheated: he's an asshole.\n\nHe's your ex.  What the fuck do you care what he thinks or what he wants?", ">My ex is livid and says that I am wicked for bothering them with our personal problems and I was cruel for stressing them out because they are old.\n\nDid somebody hold a gun to his head and tell him to cheat on you with men 5 to 10 years younger? I mean, I\u2019m LOST. Did anyone force him to use you for ego boosts, validation and attention while he triangulated you with other men? Sis is delusional. \n\nThere would be no divorce card for you to play had he not dealt you the cards himself. Unlike him, you cannot live a lie. You _had_ to be honest with her, out of respect for them and for yourself. You did the right thing, NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve been generous, empathetic and gracious to continue to spend time with the family despite the rift between you two. That is a testament to your character...and to his high levels of entitlement. He sounds like he has some narcissist traits. Might be helpful to check out r/narcissisticabuse", "NTA he is for making you keep this secret! He stands to lose something if you 2 are not together it sounds like", "NTA.\n\nYes the truth might hurt but lieing to them, letting them believe they might get a grandchild soon is so much more horrible. Especially if your partner tries to scam them off the \u00a3200k... (or why is this still on the table?).\n\nYou could consider calling them, thanking them for being such caring and generous people and that you're sorry if you hurt them. On the other hand they're probably more hurt by their son lieing to them than by you telling the truth...", "Tbh it wouldn't be petty at all. It's simply the truth. You have no obligation to cover up for someone's shitty behaviour.\n\nStop lying and pretending to coddle your ex, why on earth are you going along with that?", "Saw your past posts and my heart breaks for you. You\u2019ve tried so hard for this man who clearly doesn\u2019t deserve you", "NTA - sounds like the soon to be ex is up to something shady.  His parents sound so sweet.  I hope you\u2019re able to keep them in your life (if that\u2019s what you want!)", "It\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about them. I didn\u2019t want to create drama at Christmas and I know my sister will also struggle with her relationship with my in laws because they love her and the baby.", "The more I read about narcissism the more I am convinced that he\u2019s a textbook case because I\u2019ve listened to several podcasts and have read a few posts about others who were in a relationship with a narcissist and the similarities are uncanny.", "He didn\u2019t and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a fan of the saying, when you look at some through rose tinted glasses all the red flags look like flags.", "I\u2019m not sure because it means having that relationship with him by proxy which is going to be hard. I want a clean break.", "I bet he was also trying to swindle some surrogacy money from them.", "NTA and you have no obligation to be a party to his infidelity. You get to say your own truth, whenever you want to. There's nothing at all wrong in letting others simply know you're getting divorced.", "Well, if he causes a ruckus, you should tell them. Decency only goes so far if it isn't reciprocated. The fact that he wanted you to hide your divorce already shows that he cares more about looking good in front of his family than trying to make amends or any kind of apology.", "Well why the hell not? You\u2019re obviously a good man if you\u2019re willing to save your ex\u2019s face. But I have to highly recommend you stop. None of this is healthy for your own mental health. NTA", "Then stop lying for him. No more keeping your divorce secret from anyone. You can decline to get into details if you want . . . although, quite frankly I would be fully honest with people because you just know he's going to claim you were the one cheating", "That honestly is a good reason to tell people why the divorce is happening. It's not petty, it's for your protection. You're putting yourself and others at risk of being lied about or to by allowing him to control the narrative. \n\nYou deserve not to be slandered, and his family deserves to know what their money and time/energy is supporting. If he's as dishonest and manipulative as it sounds, then not being upfront about the reason for separation is just giving him control over a very big and emotionally charged situation. \n\nBut maybe that's just my biased, extreme hatred towards cheaters talking.", "You have to do what\u2019s best for you even if it\u2019s hard on his parents.  Cheaters suck.  I hope it all works out well and you find peace and new love!", "Bingo! As I was reading I kept waiting for this, his parents call to ask how the baby plans are going since they've sent over the money. Gosh, I hope they didn't give OP'S husband the money.", "He won\u2019t be able to lie because I\u2019ve got evidence to show that he would be lying.", "I\u2019ve only done that once because it was Christmas and I didn\u2019t want to bring that drama. I didn\u2019t have to interact with him much.", "I suspect he is or he\u2019s trying to get money from them in some other way before we finalise the divorce", "I have contemplated it and won\u2019t shy away from telling people why the divorce is happening if he attempts to lie or play the victim. I\u2019ve got receipts.", "Then, don't care.", "That's good. As long as you feel sufficiently protected. \n\nGood luck with the divorce, and I'm sorry you're in this situation.", "NTA\n\nHe wants to cheat but act like everything is great. Tough shit.", "NTA \n\nIt's good that you told your in-laws. Your ex is not a good person and I agree that he wanted to get money out of them.", "NTA. Your ex is sneaky and cowardly. Tell everyone and expose him for what he is.", "That isn't petty.  It's the truth.", "So he is lying to them to get money, for a surrogate that no longer exists, so he can use it for things other than the gifter intended, so basically lying. Sounds a lot like fraud and elder abuse. \n\nHonestly if it were me, I'd lay it all out on the table and voice my concerns to them about him scamming them for money. If I cared for an older couple and this was happening, I couldn't not speak up. \n\n\n But I can be petty AF.", "But you are showing you care by playing along to his requests.\n\nIt is not your responsibility to keep his \u201chappy\u201d family play. The moment you filed, you should made it public that you were getting divorced. You don\u2019t have to tell the reason (if you don\u2019t want to). You should be the one who gets to control the narrative."]}
