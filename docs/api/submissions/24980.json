Amd don't back down.  I take it from the government pay you aren't registered as a childcarer, so it might tobe worth looking into that and making things more official.  But you need to grow a backbone if you are going to look after children in your own home: make a list of expectations/rules and remember you are interviewing both the parents and children when you have a meet up, if they start to mess up your house during this interview process tell them to stop,  explain to them that this is unacceptable and what discipline you will enforce if they continue.", "NTA, her children\u2019s poor behavior getting them kicked out is not your emergency.", "NTA, but tell them why", "I'm a bit confused.

You should also think about some rules for the parents (payment plans, running late to pickup kids, emergencies, etc.) and rules for the kids (biters will be given a warning or immediately kicked out or whatever). And make sure you get whatever permits, licenses, insurance, etc. that are required or are prudent.\n\nMy advice is to put on your business hat. This isn't quite like babysitting or like being a nanny. It sounds like you are considering taking in multiple children from multiple homes. You need to think logistics and risk mitigation.", "One, that is too little for two kids for a whole day.  Tell her it will be $100 day because both of them have behavioral problems.  And two, they will pay for damage to your possessions (maybe you'll care for them at their house, not sure).\n\nSince they have behavioral problems, you would care for them on a provisional basis (only if you want the job).  \n\nPersonally, the job would not be worth it to me to do it for $100 a day.", "NTA.

Start with that. \n\nAlso it would be ok in that scenario - if your first request to the children to stop is ignored - to turn to mum & ask her to stop her children\u2019s behaviour. Because as you say, you\u2019ve only just met them, and don\u2019t have that relationship yet. \n\nThe key to this is probably to change your viewpoint to one where you are interviewing the parent & child to see if it\u2019s a good fit, as much as them meeting you & deciding the same. \n\nWhile this obviously feels horrible right now, it\u2019s actually a really good experience for your business in the long term. \n\nNext time you won\u2019t agree to start care without meeting them first. \n\nAnd you need to add some behaviour clauses into your contract with them.

If they don\u2019t, on (number of) occasions, then your contract is cancelled & they won\u2019t be welcome back, for the safety of all involved (because you\u2019ll have multiple children in your care, so you cannot have 1 child ruin it for the others). \n\nMake sure to be clear about the money too. Maybe have them pay the month up front, and that\u2019s not reimbursable if they are \u201cfired\u201d as clients for breaking the behaviour clauses. \n\nYou could also send out the behaviour rules & clause in advance, while scheduling the interview - so the parents who know they won\u2019t agree to it won\u2019t waste your time.", "You have no obligation to take on this job, especially at the poor pay.

Obviously hindsight is a wonderful thing and I imagine you felt very uncomfortable in the moment. The mother may have thought you were happy with everything because you didn't say anything.
