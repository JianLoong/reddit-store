Wife's employer is the AH and literally operating illegally by retaliating against a worker for reporting unsafe work conditions to exactly the correct people to report it to. It sounds like this lab not only puts their employees at risk for both health and safety, but it also sounds like a nasty, filthy, pest infested hell hole if she's bringing home 'little friends\". I would report the hell out of it whether or not my spouse agreed to it as no one should have to deal with pest infestations in their home because their spouse is too much of a baby to stand up to their employer and report it. I highly doubt anyone here saying OP is the AH would just be okay with their spouse bringing roaches, rats, bedbugs, and/or etc. into their home from work. Get real. The only thing that could've been done better, is informing the spouse ahead of time before reporting said issues, but if she isn't willing to do it herself because she prefers to kiss her bosses' asses than stop subjecting her husband to the nasty little \"friends\" she keeps bringing home and the worry of her becoming ill, then by all means he has no choice but to do it for her.
