You are supposed to be a team.   YTA.  for sure.

Easy one.", "YTA dude. Why couldn't any of her do workers or her herself call OSHA?", "OP, you didn't just mess up your wife's work life. You have messed up your marriage.

You needed to talk to your wife about this and A) she needed to agree and B) she should've called. \n\nYour wife might have been able to make the complaints in a way that wasn't so obvious about who made the complaint, but making complaints based on things your wife told you about means it's a lot easier for people to point the finger at your wife.", "Had your wife gone to management first with her concerns?  Was she ignored?  Why was the nuclear option the first one?  \n\nHonestly, OSHA is probably just going to ask them to fix it first.  Which is what your wife could have done, perhaps anonymously.  \n\nIf the company would have been willing to fix it, all you've done is open them up to potentially crippling fines.  \n\nOr are you hoping for some whistle-blower money?  Is that an osha thing?,\n\nEither way, I don't know enough to say if you're the AH.  Maybe your wife wasn't taking a safety issue seriously enough.  \n\nBut I don't think the damage is fixable at this point.
