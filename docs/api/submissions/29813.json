I would report the hell out of it whether or not my spouse agreed to it as no one should have to deal with pest infestations in their home because their spouse is too much of a baby to stand up to their employer and report it. I highly doubt anyone here saying OP is the AH would just be okay with their spouse bringing roaches, rats, bedbugs, and/or etc. into their home from work. Get real. The only thing that could've been done better, is informing the spouse ahead of time before reporting said issues, but if she isn't willing to do it herself because she prefers to kiss her bosses' asses than stop subjecting her husband to the nasty little \"friends\" she keeps bringing home and the worry of her becoming ill, then by all means he has no choice but to do it for her.

So honestly, yeah OP you went about it in the wrong way, but he was really looking out for his wife\u2019s long term health bc exposure to these kind of chemicals even once or twice can be bad but regular exposure of any kind is definitely bad. I mean, Marie Curie discovered radioactive substances but she and all the interns including many young female scientists, all ended up dying of radiation poisoning. So this is not unheard of that it could be dangerous. And depending on the type of lab (whether it\u2019s research or processing) if it\u2019s research then it\u2019s not about what we KNOW is safe or unsafe it\u2019s about the UNKNOWN and the potential for all kinds of danger. So yeah OP NTA just AH for giving so many details that it became obvious. And I guess the only way to fix it is for you and/or your wife to tell all the 20 employees + boss that it was you who complained and entirely without your wife\u2019s backing or support.

One of the rules was to, before sending the kids inside after playing after lunch, to gather them in a row and count if all the kids are there. My supervisor told me a story about a college student that worked for her as part of her study. She worked as the teacher's assistant, just like I did. Well, this teachers assistant didn't think that the rule was important and it went well until she lost a kid. This kid didn't hear they had to go inside and in panic wandered off, trying to find where their home was. It took them two hours to find the kid. Luckily nothing bad happened, the kid was just a bit shaken up. The assistant got fired on the spot and got a very negative review that really impacted her study. She is now never allowed to work with children again. All because she was too lazy to count each child.

They did the wrong thing by not telling their wife, but even if the wife had said not to the OP still would have been correct in submitting the report.", "https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.osha.gov/workers%23:~:text%3DYes%252C%2520a%2520complaint%2520can%2520be,members%253B%2520government%2520officials%2520or%2520nonprofit&ved=2ahUKEwiPy_qzl5mCAxUQhIkEHcpYD6wQFnoECA0QBQ&usg=AOvVaw39HD1j39SLR6Yy-nJNYiVO\n\nWrong, per OSHA family members and spouse's may file on your behalf and you still retain your rights.", "I would accept it, too. \n\nBut I was only explaining to someone else that ESH isn't a lighter YTA, but a different judgement involving others. The topic was OP being both an asshole and pro-safety, so only OP was being discussed.", "The shop opened about 50 years before any of us worked there. How could they have known how many outlets we\u2019d need in 50 years in an age before power tools were common in the field?\n\nLike I said in another comment, we were already in the process of getting the buildings infrastructure updated to be compliant when that complaint was made. It was that interns fault that we had to put some serious strain on our bodies for months while we waited to get through all the red tape. Not sure if you know this, but you can\u2019t just install a bunch of outlets in an industrial building because you want to. There\u2019s a lot of work required to update the power system and a ton of bureaucracy that makes it take a long time.", "I highly doubt 0 but it's been a while", "I think it's not overly controlling for someone to be concerned about a partner's physical safety. However, I do agree that OP should have discussed it with the wife instead of going behind her back.", "Except she was speaking up. Why did he need to jump in like that without first asking her if she had a plan?\n\n> She's already brought up a few of the things that i mentioned to her boss prior and a couple were taken care of but a few were being continuously gaslit and my wife was coming home to me telling me all this.", "They did talk??\n\nOtherwise how would he know about her being at risk?? This seems like you didn\u2019t talk to yourself about your comment", "It seems with the [improper treatment of] chemicals, they were already making one themselves", "Okay but more people than her are in literal danger. Any decent human would report unsafe working conditions.", "Either way. You should be able to have something g reported to Osha without everyone hating you.  Ymbeen there done that.", "Sorry why do you think chemicals need to be stored properly? FOH", "Does Britain even have occupational safety and health practices let alone a govt agency?\n\nAlso I have responded inline with every comment, \n\nAtp the people want an incorrect definition of spamming", "That\u2019s also not true, but go ahead and keep commenting on every one of my comments you can find. It\u2019s very sweet and cute. \n\nYou didn\u2019t even try to understand or communicate, you\u2019re just spamming my already made comments directed at other people with real arguments", "Isn't Elon Musk currently in a bunch of lawsuits because he didn't pay ex employees promised severance?  It's been a year now.\n\nThese people talking about lawsuits have clearly only watched TV legal shows they think it's all over in an hour", "What good does it do if an accident happens and someone gets *actually* burned?", "Ok, so do I.  Solvents on their own are harmless, can you elaborate at all?\n\nEdit: water is a solvent, hence my suspicions.", "I am not TRYING to change your mind about the need for the report, which you might see if you read my posts more carefully. The issue was going behind her back and then not telling her about what he did.", "I agree with this. I wonder if OP discussed with his wife before taking it on to himself to submit the report. If she still said no, I think he would NTA if he submitted it. At that point, she\u2019s also involved in the workplace complacency that is an unsafe act and he\u2019s acting on his moral obligations. \n\nI think he was the AH for not telling her / encouraging her to file the OSHA report (no whistleblower protection), but ultimately the standards you walk by are the standards you accept. If she vents about it and does nothing about it, then I\u2019m all for OP filing the report. Nothing is above safety, especially in high risk settings like labs and work sites.", "If you more research you find out that in this case OP would not be a Bona Fide Representative because his wife didn\u2019t want to report", "Fair on that front. Again, I get the frustration but the onus was on the shop.", "It was never his decision to make and he seized control of the situation. Hence = controlling.", "It\u2019s controlling to take action and permanently impact someone else\u2019s place of work because you disagree, without ever discussing it or considering the impact on the person you\u2019re even doing it for. It\u2019s controlling because he has done it without any input, only his own opinion, even though ALL of the impact lands on someone else.", "Ha. She complained to him and he did NOT\ud83d\uded2 tell her he was going to complain to OSHA. And then didn\u2019t tell her for weeks before it was finally addressed by osha. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a massive lack of communication to his wife on his part. Likely she will not trust him with any info going forward now, which may actually put her at more risk at her job if they still continue to be negligent in safety. Instead he should have tried to continue discussing HER options to help make the work environment better, including going to OSHA.", "Depending on what they worked with, every one at that location and every one in the businesses around them could have been at risk. We don't know what chemicals they worked with so it could be anything from long term health risks to immediate explosions. \n\nIf safety is not a top priority then OP should be talking to his wife about leaving that company. If the safety issues seemed to be encouraged or at least tolerated by upper management then calling OHSA may have been his only option. \n\nBut I do agree he should have talked to his wife first. The actual info given to OHSA may have  possible to be vague enough that it would be harder for others to determine who called.", "Weird thing to be downvoted for.", "Either way not his decision to make. We don\u2019t have the specific details and we don\u2019t know how serious the violations were to automatically decide he was justified doing what he did. That\u2019s my point.", "Yes the HSE looks after workplace safety. There is also legislation governing health and safety practices in the UK", "Yeeees we do - the Health and Safety at Work Act was introduced in 1974 (so not long after OSHA).

You can DM me for more specifics", "And then if you look a little further you would ALSO see that ANYONE that knows about the hazards are allowed to report, and OSHA reports are CONFIDENTIAL, meaning, even if they think it's her, they CANNOT legally retaliate. Look, I get it, lots of boot lickers on this site REALLY want employers to be allowed to be literally poisoning their employees and sending them home with pest infestations because it's really good for the bottom line. Point is, no one should be subjected to a pest infestation because their spouse is scared of their employer.", "The shop was already doing what needed to be done to fix the problem. That kid caused a bunch of bullshit for us for no reason other than he was naive and felt like he was doing the right thing.", "This is ridiculous. He's trying to do what needs to be done for her safety.", "Lmao\n\nhttps://www.labsafety.org/memorial-wall\n\nDon\u2019t ever tell anyone you care more about them than corpo. I\u2019d risk my wife\u2019s job 100x over to spend another day with her, and if I lost her due to her jobs unsafe practices, and I knew about it and still didn\u2019t speak up, I\u2019d never be able to live with myself", "I've worked in a lot of labs, some with shitty storage conditions, and if it was a life/death situation I would've called OSHA myself. Did I bitch to my significant other about the conditions? Yes, but I would've been supremely pissed if they did something like this behind my back. \n\nLikely, nothing will come of it except the wife will get black balled. Real life doesn't work like the movies and these organizations don't care. They are overworked and underpaid like everyone else.", "Strange that you think *that* is the argument being made. Literally nothing anyone that suggested talking to the wife has said made any even vague hint that their argument is or boils down to \"Have a dead wife vs have a living wife\". Can you even point to any part of their arguments that make such a suggestion?\n\nThe argument is \"have a living wife but you damaged her career vs have a living wife and you communicated like a proper husband in order to minimise damage to her career\". Why do you think damaging her career is better than not damaging her career? That's the side of the argument you are taking by suggesting no communication before calling osha."]}
