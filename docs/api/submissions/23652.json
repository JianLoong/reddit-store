You are most definitely dealing with someone who is over compensating for their own insecurities by trying to stretch a T shirt into a commentary on racism so they can police you for it making themselves feel morally superior over a t-shirt.", "Just ignore them. If the t-shirt says exactly what you said it does, and the picture doesn't add new context, then their argument is ludicrous. While conversations about race are valid and most of the time impactful, the problem is that nowadays everyone is being constantly lectured about race, and inappropriate behaviour surrounding race. People are quick to band together and start attacking someone accused of any form of prejudice, and its put some people on edge. Not  necessarily because these people are prejudiced, but because they're terrified that their own actions could be misconstrued, and so are advising extreme caution for everyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s funny. It has nothing to do with race. Black shirts are the default choice for most uniforms that are tshirt tops.

They\u2019re the ones being racist by even thinking like that.", "I, personally, find it hilarious, and I think most people would as well. It's clearly a joke at your own expense, which is great, self-deprecating humour is my jam.\n\nI wouldn't worry overly much, unfortunately much of the world is obsessed right now with proving that they're tolerant, and they take it to such extremes that this can't be taken for the clear and obvious joke that it is.
