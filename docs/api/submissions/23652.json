That guy is in fantastic shape. By comparing yourself you obviously made fun of yourself. I personally can't see any harm done. NTA", "I do not see a racial element to this and like op find  his choice funny, he is not insulting anyone, its clearly a joke. Folk are far too sensitive these days and see problems where there are none . Don't feel bad you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Unfortunately there are always people who will say things like that because they they have no life. Ignore them. Keep wearing that very funny t-shirt.", "INFO: I which US state do you live in? Are you in a city or a mid-small sized town.\n\nPersonally i think NTA. No one is racist for wearing a jersey from an athlete they arent the same skin color of. Its pretty much a \"i like terry crews\" shirt.\n\nDepending on geography, the people complaining about your shirt are either bigots or trying so hard to be progressive their brain turned soft and they lost critical thinking skills.\n\nEdit: Peeping your account for context, you dont live in America, which makes this even sillier. You are most definitely dealing with someone who is over compensating for their own insecurities by trying to stretch a T shirt into a commentary on racism so they can police you for it making themselves feel morally superior over a t-shirt.", "Just ignore them. If the t-shirt says exactly what you said it does, and the picture doesn't add new context, then their argument is ludicrous. While conversations about race are valid and most of the time impactful, the problem is that nowadays everyone is being constantly lectured about race, and inappropriate behaviour surrounding race. People are quick to band together and start attacking someone accused of any form of prejudice, and its put some people on edge. Not  necessarily because these people are prejudiced, but because they're terrified that their own actions could be misconstrued, and so are advising extreme caution for everyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s funny. It has nothing to do with race. Black shirts are the default choice for most uniforms that are tshirt tops. I\u2019d be willing to bet Terry Crews himself would have no issue with this and would tell those that disagree to ignore it. Try it, tweet at him and ask lol.", "NTA\n\nIt's obviously a joke. Some people are just trying to get attention by playing a victim. They are looking for offense when there isn't any.", "Teacher here. That shirt is hilarious. I would have complemented you on your humor. Always be you. Enjoy the school year.", "NTA. They\u2019re the ones being racist by even thinking like that.", "I, personally, find it hilarious, and I think most people would as well. It's clearly a joke at your own expense, which is great, self-deprecating humour is my jam.\n\nI wouldn't worry overly much, unfortunately much of the world is obsessed right now with proving that they're tolerant, and they take it to such extremes that this can't be taken for the clear and obvious joke that it is. Sad times really.", "No you're not an asshole, I think that's a funny shirt", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s hilarious and so is Terry Crews. He\u2019d probably approve.", "NTA and I (F, 40s, white,  far from buff) would love to have that tshirt and would definitely wear it", "NTA But Info is it because Terry Crews is in himself problematic when it comes to racial issues? Did any one say what the actual issue was?", "One thing you'll learn as you grow up is that a lot of people don't appreciate racial humor, they find it rude and antagonistic. I think this is one such example. Slight but YTA", "If the girl was black then I would listen to her perspective on anti-black racism", "YTA-blackface has a long, painful history in the US and your black shirt could be seen as that. \n\nYou didn\u2019t mean it to be an issue, but you have to understand history and context. Sometimes a joke isn\u2019t worth it.\n\nDepending on your age and geography, your classmates\u2019 parents or grand parents could have been affected by Jim Crow laws. \n\nGet another shirt.\n\nETA, because reading comprehension is apparently difficult for a lot of people:\n\nThe shirt is not a black shirt. It is a shirt, printed black on the front only. Anyone saying that a two toned shirt, with black in the front only, is industry standard, is either lying or is being willfully obtuse.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's called irony.", "Kids at your school think they\u2019re some kind of political genius. Ignore em. If you\u2019re getting think pieces on your shirt, in this case, I think that\u2019s good. It\u2019s fucking hilarious (I\u2019m a black man) and would definitely chuckle if I saw a white kid wearing that shirt. I couldn\u2019t name a single reason as to how that is a cause for racial division other than people being offended for other people. Who all has said this to you?", "Not everyone on Reddit lives in the US...", "It is a lack of critical thinking skills.", "The shirt is NOT a racial joke. And you seeing it that way makes you part of the problem. \n\nTerry Crews is known for his *physique*. Not the color of his skin. He is not a black activist. He is a body builder through and through. \n\nThe shirt refers to the joke of an out of shape guy (majority of normal people) claiming to be a stunt double for one of the MOST famous *body builders* in our current generation. \n\nThe fact that you cant get past the skin color of the parties involved implies that you are the one obsessed with skin color here. \n\nSkim color doesn\u2019t matter.

He's wearing a t-shirt of terry crews, what is the humour or joke?", "It's not racial humor. OP is making fun of himself.", "The shirt isn\u2019t black because Terry Crews is an African American. Black is a standard shirt color for many professions uniforms which is exactly the joke the shirt is making. This is not comparable to blackface at all just stop it.", "Wait. Are you *actually* claiming that wearing a black t-shirt is *blackface*?", "In what world is wearing a black t-shirt with an actor's face on it similar to painting your face black to portray a racist caricature of black people??", "They dont even live in America, and OP's T-shirt is no more racist than a white kid wearing a LeBron jersey", "Oh damn, I never thought about how the colour of the shirt could have been the issue, I only chose the colour black because that is what crew members wear on film sets most often, ok thank you for the advise :) I will probably jsut find a shirt with terry crews's face on it or something.", "The whole shirt is black, sorry if that wasn't clear (apart from the text which is white)", "The color being black in the front only clearly alludes to Terry\u2019s ethnicity. Otherwise, why would it only be printed black on the front, instead of just being a black T-shirt?", "Yes, and the premise of the joke includes the fact that he can't be mistaken for Terry Crews because Crews is a large black man and he is a skinny white boy. I don't think it's offensive! but it is objectively racial humor, and not everyone enjoys that or wants to be around it. For example, that shirt would obviously be inappropriate at most professional workplaces. So it is not unreasonable that it would also be inappropriate at a school.", "The shirt is black on the front only. Having a black front shit is not standard in uniforms.", "The tshirt isn\u2019t black. It is printed black on the front.", "The shirt was not black with an actor\u2019s face. It is a shirt with the front printed black.", "He is wearing a shirt that is printed black on the front only. That is not the same as wearing a jersey.", "Please, *please* don\u2019t take that advice to heart. You can wear whatever color shirt you want. Black t-shirts have absolutely NOTHING to do with blackface.", "I never even thought of it like that", "Is the whole shirt black, or just the front OP? That really makes a difference.", "You clearly didn\u2019t even read the OP fully. OP is not skinny by their own admission, he said he is an out of shape short white kid. The irony has nothing to do with Terry Crews skin color and the color of the shirt is the most common standard color used as a uniform. The irony is Terry Crews is an extremely buff guy and OP is not. Full stop.", "It's not racial. So many people saying something harmless is racist is causing people to take real racism less seriously. It needs to stop.", "Why exactly would it inappropriate at workplaces?", "Yes it is. Aside from a company logo on the left chest which no one would know to put on, most \u201cBOUNCER\u201d or \u201cSECURITY\u201d shirts are empty on the front\n\nEdit - you\u2019re making a distinction that it\u2019s only black on the front.

In fact I specifically said it was inoffensive.\n\nWhat a weird thing to say...not sure what kind of issues you have but please leave me out of it lol.", "I think anyone in a job should avoid wearing any joke based, or entertainment based, or politics based attire. It's easy to offend someone without realising it, and you can't predict where a disagreement will end up, especially if the person who is offended has a senior role.", "I just explained it in the above post, because most professional environments do not allow t-shirts with racial humor on them, even if the jokes are inoffensive, because they could be misconstrued to cause offense and lead to legal issues.

Goodbye.", "Yeah I am unsure why people are having difficulty with this, maybe they are teenagers? Lol", "But there is no racial joke here. You *choosing* to see a racial joke says more about you than the shirt.", "I did. I think they worded it weird. Unless they clarify I\u2019m imagining an all black shirt.", "Im 36, and work in HR. I would be stoked to see someone wearing a terry crews shirt. Terry crews is a national treasure.", "But OP even said part of what makes the shirt funny is that he is of a different race and therefore would make a bad body double? I also agree that it's funny and innoffensive, but the race part is obviously a part of the joke?\n\nI don't understand why everyone is being so weird about admitting there is a racial component here to the humor, there's nothing wrong with that and yet everyone's freaking out in the comments?"]}
