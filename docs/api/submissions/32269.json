Not for not getting them gifts etc, but for making such an old fashioned rule and telling people about it. You've created an issue where there wasn't one and drawn your MIL into it. I'd be VERY surprised if BIL's future wife even wants a relationship with you, you can't just not make an effort with someone til there's a ring on their finger and then expect to play happy families", "YTA. I get it, but you are acting like an AH in my opinion. Like...it just should not be that difficult to make a bit of an effort. You don't have to become best friends with these women, but you can absolutely make them feel welcome and included.\n\nOne day he might actually marry one of these women one, and if you think you can build a relationship with whoever she is once they're married you're kidding yourself. If someone waited til marriage to make an effort with me, I'd tell them to jog on.", "INFO:\n\nWhy did you implement this rule? Did you get 'invested' in a friendship with his girlfriend, only for him to expect you to end said friendships when his relationship with them ended? \n\nDoes your BIL have a tendency to get engaged to these girlfriends? Why won't an engagement count? Lets not forget, some people are engaged for *years* before they get married. So what, you will treat then as no more than an acquaintance for years if that was the case?\n\nDid he ignore you, treat you as nothing more than an acquaintance, before you married his sibling?\n\nDo you, despite your rule, expect them to do or get anything for you for holidays/occasions?", "YTA. It seems super arbitrary to not get them something small, but that's your right. Where you become the asshole is announcing that you're not investing in people until they are legally wed to your BIL. You're creating a problem where there isn't one. Why did you need to make a grand announcement? Why are you setting things up to be a zero sum game in your husband's family? The self-righteousness is pretty gross.", "YTA for not having the decency to treat these women like people. You don't have to treat them like relatives with a long history going back, but you can treat them like ordinary people. What if you BIL suddenly meet the woman if his dreams and they decide to live together for eternity but not get married for whatever reason? Will you continue to act as the woman doesn't exist?", "LMAO YTA big time. \nYou realise that a lot of couples are in healthy, long term, loving and caring relationships without ever getting married? \nIf I was BIL or his girlfriend I would avoid any contact with you at all costs. You sound insufferable, conservative, cold and bigoted.", "Asshole move to make a stink about it. You could have not getting invested as a policy and just be quiet about it, but as is YTA.", "Yes YTA. I hope your BIL and his gfs return the favor. You sound insufferable.", "YTA you sound condescending and annoying as fuck. Who tf cares if they\u2019re not married who tf cares if he\u2019s got a new gf every year", "You are harsh.\n\nI understand if the couple are just dating but as the couple grows closer, takes steps to that indicate a longer term commitment you should start to be getting investing the the relationship.  it can be slow for you, but you should start.\n\nSome people never get married but are together long term, have families, and grow old together.\n\nYou are insisting on a piece of paper, and not every couple needs that.  \n\nYTA", "9yrs and 4 girlfriends...\n\n\nYour own words but then you call it a revolving door every 6 to 12 months, your math isn't mathing.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is easy: He will go no contact, and you won't be invited to his life events, because you ostracize his partners. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe probably will react with a \"NO AHs\" rule. So don't come crying to reddit soem years down the line when your husband gets an invite to his weddding, but you don't.

It\u2019s just that none of this needed to be verbalized. You didn\u2019t have to say anything at all. So soft YTA, but I do get where you\u2019re coming from. Just learn when to keep thoughts in your head instead of saying everything out loud.", "YTA - marriage isn\u2019t the be all end all. Many marriages last less time than your BIL\u2019s relationships haha.\n\nI get not wanting to deal with a regular rotation of relationships, but I think you\u2019re being very narrow-minded. As with any relationship, your BIL\u2019s should be taken on a case-by-case basis. Just be nice, be kind, and if you like them then integrate them into your family. This arbitrary \u201cyou\u2019re not married so I\u2019m going to treat you as less than\u201d is ridiculous. You may hate the person he ends up marrying. What then?", "YTA. My brother is also a man of revolving relationships. When he brought his gf to Xmas last year, I got her a candle. I may not go out of my way to form bonds with the women but I\u2019m always warm and kind to them. It\u2019s not their fault he has a new relationship every 1-2 years. Buying a candle or a box of chocolates is not hard.", "YTA. If they're living together or engaged, you have to treat them as a couple, even if you're pretty sure they're going to break up. I suggest buying holiday presents that are low-effort and could easily be given to someone else if this relationship breaks up before the holidays. Anything customized or highly personal = no. Candles, candy/cookies, tea/coffee, pens/pencils/note cards, calendars, holiday mugs = yes.", "NTA\n\nThe wording is harsh but I understand the position you're taking.  The \"I do\" rule sounds sanctimonious but simply explaining that while his current girlfriend seems lovely she's not really at gift giving level yet.  \n\nAlso, your husband should be doing the gifting in the family. It's shouldn't be your job anyways.", "You are definitely the asshole here. Its not the new girls fault your brother in law has a bad streak with women. Even if they do get married I wouldnt want anything to do with you if you treated me like this the whole relationship.\n\nNobody said you had to go all out. Cheap perfumes and chocolates for christmas or something so that person isnt empty handed. You\u2019re insufferable and i\u2019m sure all these comments will not be enough to change your opinion.\n\nGod help you", "That old saying \"when you marry someone, you marry into their family\" comes to mind.\n\nOP there, all sour faced to the gf, looking like they are jealous of the new women in the BIL's life.", "YTA. Imagine making your BIL' relationships all about you. Get the hell over yourself.", "YTA. So like, say he ends up in a long term relationship. Say he\u2019s been with the same woman for like, 7 years. They live together, have kids, share finances. They function as a family but don\u2019t see the need to get married. You still gonna freeze the woman out? Still gonna not acknowledge her on holidays and avoid getting \u201cinvested\u201d? \n\nNot everyone wants to get married. You\u2019re basically saying you don\u2019t approve of his life and won\u2019t until he lives it by your rules.", "\u201cI made up an arbitrary rule that lets me be an asshole to other people until X happens. AITA?!!!\u201d", "YTA. What's the difference between buying a present for a gf or a hypothetical wife he never divorced 9 years ago? \n\nI'd understand if you were trying to protect your feelings by not getting close to someone that might leave. But it doesn't sound like that. I get the impression you're showing a lot of disdain over your BIL's friends and life choices.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a rather extreme take to punish these women when you\u2019re actually upset with your BIL. How hard is it to give them a box of chocolate on their birthday? You don\u2019t have to invite them on a girl\u2019s weekend, but you can be a little friendlier than you currently are. If you keep this up, by the time he does put a ring on it, she\u2019s not going to be receptive to your 180 and may permanently keep you at arms length due to the precedent you\u2019ve adamantly set.\n\nMaybe you should talk to BIL about why he\u2019s got a new girlfriend every 6-12 months, because that\u2019s not cool, especially if he\u2019s bringing his flavor of the month to gift-giving family gatherings, leading them to believe he\u2019s more serious about them than he actually is. And his latest girlfriend has a kid? Extra not cool. Who\u2019s your BIL, Ted Moseby?", "Yta,  this is a ridiculous drama creating rule.   Regardless the woman is a person that has actually feelings and you are being an ah to her.   Buy some standard gift and be done\n\n you obviously enjoy creating drama", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to get them gifts. You could say you\u2019re not close enough to exchange them. But your attitude really sucks. \n\nAssuming the girlfriends are decent people, you\u2019re choosing to skip any kindness because they might not be around that long? That\u2019s not what holiday giving is about for me, but I guess you feel differently. \n\nOne day one of them might stay and she\u2019s going to think you\u2019re a real AH because of your attitude.", "YTA - you are being incredibly and unnecessarily rude! Small gifts are appropriate  if he is bringing her home  for Christmas ?  According to you, she is nothing until after the wedding ceremony, and nothing else matters", "YTA\n\nNo wonder no relationship makes it to marriage. Who wants to marry into a family when someone is so clearly cold & distant to you and refuses to get to know you as a person until AFTER you marry a relative of theirs. During dating, especially when it\u2019s serious & heading toward long term/marriage, you are also looking at the family you are could possibly be joining. If BIL & your husband are close & spend time together, which means if she married him she might be spending time with you if you all get together & you are so dismissive of even getting to know her, she can see that as an untenable situation because she can\u2019t live like that (she doesn\u2019t know you to trust that you\u2019ll suddenly welcome her after the wedding cause you won\u2019t build that friendship/trust now) but she wouldn\u2019t want to make BIL spend less time with his brother, your husband. \n\nJust be a nice decent person. Maybe if there is more positive energy in general at gatherings, especially if BIL wants others to see what he sees in his girlfriend, it may energize the relationship to grow instead of having to explain to her that no his SIL doesn\u2019t hate her after every family gathering.", "What a weirdo. YTA", "YTA - you sound like such a joy to be around! /s", "YTA. Unnecessary and dumb rule, making problems where there are none. Passive agressive judgement", "YTA.

They're not entitled to anything. Do they give you stuff on holidays and the like?", "YTA, absolutely ridiculous \u201crule\u201d adding drama and rigidity where none is needed.

You can get gifts for whoever you want but you\u2019re really up on your high horse with your reasoning. Also you\u2019re kind of full of yourself. Do you really think your brother in law cares if you\u2019re \u2018invested\u2019 in his relationships?  Wouldn\u2019t it be easier to get the flavor of the month that are around for gift giving occasions a token present than to be so smug and judgy?", "YTA, not for the rule, but for saying it out loud.", "Yeah YTA, for causing drama to make yourself feel better. You don't have to be BFFs to show some basic courtesy.", "Smart", "NTA\n\nMy brother had three VERY serious GF's. He was with all of them for four years, gave or take a few months. I got very invested with the first one, they had discussed marriage and kids, and then he broke up with her. The same pattern of him being very serious with these girls continued, but he never actually proposed, and he always broke up with then almost like clockwork at 4 years. When he met his wife (ironically, his fourth partner), I was friendly but made no effort to get invested until he proposed. I then worked to build bridges and we are now *very* close.\n\nShe understands why I waited until they were actually committed rather than just dating or living together. It's very difficult to get close to someone who is suddenly cut out of your life, and when it has happened frequently, you get jaded. My loyalty is always to my brother first. As long as you're not an AH to them, you're fine. Protect your own feelings, but do know that when he does say 'I do', you may have to do a fair bit of work to be close to his wife.", "INFO\n\nSo were you treated that way? If not, YTA", "NTA\n\nAll the people calling you an asshole are just used to women doing their labour for them. You aren't related to BIL or his girlfriends.

Why is this meant to work one way?", "NTA I completely understands, it is hard to get invested in people that probably are gonna go away soon and you will never see again. Sometimes it\u00b4s good to set boundaries to pretect ones heart.", "NTA.. if you spend time, energy and love getting to know and be close to his girlfriend's only for him to dump them then his split from them could be equally upsetting for you .

This reads like something my SIL could have written. Over the last five years, I\u2019ve had a different girlfriend every 6-12 months. My family is always welcoming and nice, but they don\u2019t want to get too invested in someone that might not be around for the next family gathering. I\u2019d probably feel the same way in their shoes. NTA for feeling that way, but your delivery could have been nicer.", "Why do idiots like you live your life by dumb rules like this? They don;t suddenly become human if he marries them. \n\nIf you don't want to get to know them, just never bother, they may not realise it but you're doing them a favour.", "NTA - lot of people on here not recognising the difference between basic courtesy and real investment in a relationship. One is for everybody until proven otherwise, the other has to come with time.", "YTA", "I\u2019m going against the grain and saying NTA, but only by a small thread. No one is entitled to a gift, especially if you\u2019re not close and there\u2019s no reciprocation. \n\nI do think you should not only keep the reason for your rule to yourself, but also rename it from \u201cI Do\u201d to \u201cNo there yet\u201d because the name of it sounds harsh. There\u2019s no harm in setting rules for gifts as they can get expensive when you have to add on extra people. Would it be hard to keep a set of generic gifts (spa sets, candles, etc.) in a closet somewhere for instances like this? No. But again, no one is entitled to receiving gifts.", "I mean, as far as Christmas gifts go, I'd make a point to get the same thing every year and see if anybody noticed. It's shitty to go to another family's Christmas and not have presents.

I understand wanting to make sure the girl is actually going to be around for a while, but why marriage? For me, the length of time would be the bigger factor.

Same thing for my birthday and other holidays. Everyone was kind and asked a few questions about myself, but overall nothing really happened. Of course the next few years when we were engaged to now when we're married, I did get gifts and was included more into the traditions.

To: Jenna, my name is Ashley. Then you've walked into another situation, and I'm sure your family would think you did it on purpose.  \n\nAgain, as long as you are polite to them when you see them, I don't see a problem with your stance.", "Yeah I\u2019m honestly kind of shocked at all of the people calling out OP for not wanting to give a gift to someone she doesn\u2019t know very well.

A $20 set of creams or fragrances from bath and body works is good enough for any woman, or even a candle bro.\n\nYou\u2019re right in him not owing her anything. Still a bad look. Dont expect her to form a relationship with you if you show no effort afterwards", "Yes, he can. However, she asked if she's TA for this, and she is.", "I can\u2019t imagine dating someone for a few months and expecting a gift from my bf\u2019s brother\u2019s wife. In many cases they probably haven\u2019t even met before.", "It\u2019s also traditional to exchange gifts on Christmas, something all of BIL girlfriends neglected to do.", "Umm. It\u2019s possible to be civil and friendly without being invested. Why would OP be expected to get any gifts to someone they aren\u2019t even related to?", "Several years maybe\u2026 but OP specifically said they don\u2019t even last a year. And as new GF, I\u2019m not expecting my partner\u2019s family to gift me anything. As long as OP does not say it to her face, it\u2019s ok for her to have her reasoning.", "This all reminds me of the SNL skit about the Christmas Candle", "Our eldest is a serial dater, how bad is it? His dad and his own son are referring to the women as Next. Our grandson is nice to them, but does not even think about getting emotionally attached. \nAs for us we are polite. But OP has taken it to a new level, not even an inexpensive gift when it is an event for them? I would say mild assholery is involved here.", "It can be annoying when you have a family member like this who\u2019s a serial dater. \n\nOur dad got divorced for the *second* time a couple years ago. He had a girlfriend of about six months he brought to thanksgiving, then they broke up, and now he has another one. \n\nI had to sit him down and tell him I didn\u2019t plan on spending every holiday awkwardly getting to know some new woman of his, buying her gifts and such. Told him he needed to keep them away from us until they were actually really serious, or I wouldn\u2019t be coming home for holidays anymore.", "The brother should get a gift for OP to give his girlfriend?\n\nEdit: OMG I\u2019m illiterate and stupid, mb. You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right.", "Where does it say OP or spouses gender?", "Ya the real issue here isn\u2019t the gifts, it\u2019s brother bringing girls he\u2019s known for less than a year to holidays. \n\nDon\u2019t introduce people to your family unless you\u2019re seriously involved, and definitely don\u2019t bring them around on holidays.", "Just a sausage. The short, thick summer sausage.", "Fair enough, but ...\n\nIf others are rude, should I also be?\n\nand\n\nI take it, OP has no significant other. Gifting one part of a pair is quite a _foix pas_. The question wasn't if those girlfriends were AHs. Which btw also not so easy, did they even know that OP _exists and will be there_? How much BIL told them about the family?\n\nOP, on the other hand, knew, that BIL is coming with +1.", "In my culture we give gifts to work colleagues, never mind friends. And definitely all the people with whom we celebrate festivities. But whatever, cultures differ.\n\nOP is welcome to make whatever culturally appropriate choice about gifts that she wants as long as she keeps her mouth shut and does not make hurtful public announcements about how she looks down on a certain person for sexist reasons (namely, lack of a wedding ring).\n\nIf I were the girlfriend, my response to OP would be, \"Alright, as you prefer, you are the one who made this choice, I will make sure to remember this forever. We cannot be family, the two of us will never be family, and I will never treat you as a family member. If someday I end up marrying your BIL and you decide to start giving me Christmas gifts after the wedding ceremony, I will return them back to you unopened.\"\n\nPersonally, I firmly believe in chosen family over DNA. I am not opposed to being low contact with in laws or people with whom I share DNA. I also never forgive getting treated poorly. If somebody treats me coldly after having recently met but afterwards two years later they suddently want to have a relationship with me, I will refuse, because that ship sailed away back when we were still getting to know each other.\n\nFrankly, I have no clue why OP expects the new wife to give her a second chance of building a relationship after being ignored for years due to being \"only a girlfriend.\" Why would anybody want to try to befriend a person who ignored you for years for a sexist reason?", "If BIL someday marries, he will have been with the new wife for several years before marriage. OP has decided to ignore these girlfriends until there is a ring, potentially for years. \n\nIf I was with a partner for years and got engaged and the future SIL had ignored me for all this time only to suddenly start talking to me after the wedding day, I would refuse any interactions with her besides the bare minimum like \"hello.\" For me she would always remain \"that annoying in law who ignored me for years and from whom I must keep a distance.\"\n\nIf I have known some person for years, but there has never been any friendly interactions between us, I will already have acquired a negative attitude towards them and I will try to avoid staying with them in the same spaces.\n\nMaybe that is just me, some form of social anxiety or whatever, but whenever in my life there is a person I know who acts as if they do not want to interact with me, I put effort into staying away from them. If years later they suddenly change their behavior and attempt to befriend me, I will be creeped out and run away from this weird attention that just showed up from nowhere. For example, I will happily introduce myself to a new neighbor, but I would be creeped out by having to talk to a neighbor whom I have known for years and who always ignored me. Such sudden shifts in attitude creep me out.", "It doesn\u2019t bother me because my family is a \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d type. It\u2019s not unusual for someone to bring over a friend or two or just some folks who don\u2019t have anywhere else to go on the holiday. But we we also fortunate that we live close to one another so it\u2019s not like we only see each other on thanksgiving or anything like that.", "OP has mentioned her husband in multiple comments. \n\nIt's also not hard at all to read between the lines that she is being expected to buy gifts for her parnter's famiy because it's generally assumed women will do all of the social labor in hetero couples.", "All the more reason", "I HATE summer sausage- even from Harry and David.", "Cultural pressure to behave a certain way is stupid.  If you choose to give someone gifts, great. If not, that\u2019s cool. \n\nThere is no new wife here. She clearly has been pressured to treat each girlfriend like a member of the family. That\u2019s not how she sees it and that is fine. No one here but the OP was treated poorly.", "12", ">OP has mentioned her husband in multiple comments.\n\nHave they? Because I checked before I asked this and saw none. I've seen multiple comments by *other people* referring to a husband", "Well, OP certainly has every right to stay low contact or no contact with any person for any reason. I do oppose cultural pressures that tell people to spend time with specific family members.\n\nBut girlfriends also have every right to stay low or no contact with OP after she chose to ignore them. If someday BIL gets married, OP will not be entitled to a relationship with the new wife whom she ignored until the wedding day. She will not be entitled to forgiviness or a second chance to develop a relationship. If you have always ignored a person whom you have known for a prolonged amount of time, they will probably have a grudge on you and they will choose to continue being low contact with you.\n\nActions have consequences. Ignore a person whom you know and they will dislike you for it. As long as OP knows what she wants and maintaining low contact with BIL's family is her lifelong preference, good for her.", "But she never said ignore.  She said she would treat them nice, but wouldn\u2019t get heavily involved. \n\nReading between the lines, this seems to me that the OP is setting some appropriate boundaries.", "Hopefully OP understands that if BIL ever gets married, the new wife will treat her \"without getting heavily involved\" for ever. She should not feel entitled to the new wife's attention after the marriage. As long as OP wants to remain low contact with BIL's family for the rest of her life, good for her. But she should not count on being given a second chance by the new wife in case BIL ends up getting married. And if she someday starts sending gifts to the woman whom she largely ignored before marriage, she should not be surprised about getting them back unopened. If you choose to not get involved with somebody, they will respond in kind, and changing your mind later on might be impossible, because the person with whom you did not want to get involved in past will have zero desire to get involved with you later.\n\nI have zero objection against OP being low contact with the girlfriends. She is not the asshole here. That's her right, she can pick her boundary.\n\nI am opposed to OP's attitude where she expects to get heavily involved with BIL's wife after the wedding and feels entitled to a relationship with BIL's future wife. Most likely, at that point, this ship will have sailed for OP.", "I don\u2019t think you fully understood the post."]}
