Your stepdaughter is an adult and she can tell whoever she wants and not tell whoever she doesn't want. It'd be one thing if she were 16, but she's 24. Her mom is just hurt that her daughter chose to tell her stepmom over her mother, which I get... it must have stung. But, your stepdaughters relationship with her mother is its own thing and you can't change it.", "I mean you would have been TA if your step daughter was a child and you didn't at least let one parent know. But your step daughter is an adult, baby announcements are between her and the babies dad. Its not anyone else's business, NO ONE has a right to know before the actual soon to be parents are ready for them to know.\n\nNTA sounds like mommy is just salty because her daughter confided in you instead of her.", "NTA, that isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s decision but your step daughter\u2019s and her boyfriends, you would be the A if you did tell them. \n\nThese two are the only ones with any right to tell anyone and good on you for respecting their decision.", "NTA \n\n>She wasn\u2019t ready to announce to everyone yet but told me and her boyfriend.\n\nThat was her decision.

You respected her decision and it wasn't news you had the right to spread. If anything, her biological mother should wonder why her daughter didn't want to share the news with her", "Your stepdaughter's mother is trying to get her point in now so that you refuse if your stepdaughter asks you to be a support person in the room or if it begins to look like you will be the main grandmother figure.\n\nDon't worry about it.\n\nEdit to add nta", "NTA. Her mom should be asking herself why your step daughter wouldn\u2019t confide in her. Definitely have some guesses as to why.", "Nta, let's disregard the fact that she's your step kid. The woman is an adult and asked you not to say anything  you respected her wishes...... which means you did stay in your lane.  Looking at as a lense through step kid/step parent lense based on moms reaction no wonder she wasn't ready to tell her.", "NTA. It was not your news to share. You were respectful by keeping the secret.", "NTA - this was never your information to give. This is your step daughter\u2019s personal medical information and she has the right to privacy until she wants to disclose. \n\nYou did the right thing. The parents need to look at why their kid didn\u2019t want to tell them, not to blame you.", "INFO: How did it become obvious that you knew?", "NTA. It was not your place to tell her news. Step mom might just be angry that her daughter is closer to you than to her. You did the right thing.", "NTA there's only one person who decides who knows and when and thats mum-to-be", "NTA\n\nYour step daughter is an adult, so she gets to choose where and when to let people know that she's expecting.\n\nAll you should have had to do/say if/when asked by anyone else is that she told you in confidence and told you that she was not ready to announce to everyone yet.\n\nThis issue is between your step daughter and her mother, and in this case, my view is that it's on the mom for not having a relationship with her where your step daughter is comfortable letting her know before everyone else.\n\nIf anything your step daughters mother is the one who is disgusting, for trying to put the blame on you for not telling, and she's 100% right, it was above your pay grade, because the decision was made by the only person who has that right, which was your step daughter.\n\nI suspect if you had let the step mom, know in \"confidence\" that she would have \"outed\" you in an instant, because that is the kind of thing that jealous people do.\n\nGlad to hear that your husband was cool with things, and I'm sure that it made for a wonderful Christmas surprise for him.\n\nYou totally did the right thing when, if you had done otherwise, you may have damaged your relationship with your step daughter.\n\nBest wishes and good hope to you and your soon to be growing extended family.\n\nBe strong, be safe, be well and continue to be an awesome step mom to your daughter.", "NTA\n\n  \nThis is not a child, but your ADULT stepdaughter.

You\u2019d be the asshole if you\u2019d taken her right to tell them herself away from her! Her mother is being an asshole here.", ">It was above my pay grade.\n\nTell her that you would let her know when she starts paying you.", "NTA\n\nThe extent of your involvement (beyond just being a parent) would be telling her to tell her parents soon since they'd be excited to know. You don't get to tell other people, she is an adult and it is her thing to tell people. It isn't like she told you she needs to go to rehab of whatever, and you probably didn't know exactly how long she might wait to announce it.\n\nYou should sort of just ignore it and forgive the mother since presumably she just felt hurt and didn't fully understand that it isn't something to be mad at anyone about", "My step daughter\u2019s mother was extremely offended and said I was disgusting for not telling her parents and It was above my pay grade.\n\nPay grade? I didn't know that being a stepparent paid money. How much and does it come with benefits?", "NTA. I\u2019m a stepmother and met my stepson when he was 4. If your stepdaughters mother reacted by saying all those rude things to you and being over emotional perhaps that is why the daughter told you and not the other mother first.", "NTA. Your stepdaughter is an adult and it is entirely up to her to decide who she tells. Good on you for not sharing information that wasn't yours to share.", "Your step daughter\u2019s mother should find a cliff.  It\u2019s not your place or responsibility to share your stepdaughter\u2019s news.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason she told you first. She trusted you wouldn\u2019t share this information and she wanted you to know. It wasn\u2019t your story to tell. Bio mom is jealous that it was actually above HER pay grade. Do not engage or apologize to her. Take note that this is probably the type of grandma she will be also. Competition for status or affection.", "NTA remind them both she is an adult and asked and told you in confidence. They can be upset all they want but you were not gonna break her trust. Tell them it's not your problem to care for their feelings in this situation.", "NTA at all. Seeing that your step daughter told you and not her bio mom about her pregnancy tells us who she is closer to. The bio mom is not offended because you did not disclose her daughter's pregnancy to her, she is butt hurt because she realized that you are definitely closer to her daughter than she is. \nYour step daughter is an adult who can decide what to tell people and when by herself, it wasn't your news to disclose to others so you did the right thing and waited for her to deliver her news the way she intended to. Anyone who thinks that you should have broken the step daughter's trust and let the cat out of the bag has no understanding of privacy and consent.", "NTA. The only way you would have been required to tell her biological mother was if she was under the age of 18. And then I just would have told her father and let him handle it. But as an adult she has the right to tell anyone she wants. My step daughter is 27 and I am much closer to her than she is to either of her biological parents", "NTA she\u2019s a adult and gets to choose how and when to tell people her business. \n\nHer mother is jealous of the relationship you have with daughter and that\u2019s her issue not yours.", "Nta.\n\nCongratulations on being the person she trusted enough with the news. It shows a lot about your relationship.", "Your stepdaughter is an adult. As an adult, you are allowed to share (medical) news with the people you want and not necessarily with your parents first.\nNTA, and thank you for not spiling the beans, I have been there, and it really sucks if someone you trusted shares the news before you felt comfortable with it.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your decision to share that info, only take care of it. If she didn\u2019t tell them before then that\u2019s exactly what she wanted.", "NTA for not telling, she's 24 she can make her own damn choices about who she tells and when. It would have been a massive breach of trust to tell anyone. \n\nBut there could be some ESH because it would have been politic to look a bit more surprised. You could have saved both you and your stepdaughter some drama. I'm not clear whether you tried to hide that you knew and failed, or at the other end of the spectrum, whether you kind of rubbed it in their faces that you knew first.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t your news to tell.", "NTA her mother was simply jealous that her daughter told you but not her. It speaks to the relationship they have. Don\u2019t sweat it. Jealousy is always ugly.", "NTA.  Not your secret to tell", "NTA. \n\nThe mother was asking you to be the asshole. There is no bigger violation then a step-mother/daughter relationship then announcing her pregnancy to others before she is ready to do it herself. \n\nYou did good by honering her wishes and not telling her parents.", "NTA. She felt comfortable telling you so maybe the step daughters mom needs to ask herself \n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t she tell me?\u201d \n\u201cWhat can I do to build a bond with her so she\u2019s feels comfortable telling me those things?\u201d", "NTA - Of course you're not the asshole.  The decision to tell anyone is solely up to the person whos pregnant.  If she wasn't comfortable telling her own BIO mom, that's an issue between them, not you and her Mom.  \n\nNot that it really matters but was she trying to surprise her real mom on Christmas but just trusted you enough and needed to tell someone else?  We told our parents on Christmas as well but I also told my sister nearly as soon as I found out.  Why?  Well I trust my sister alot not to say anything and I wanted my mom to have a nice Christmas surprise, which she did.", "You would be the AH if you told anyone at all before she was ready.

This mother is just seething with jealousy, NTA", "NTA You are a person of integrity. Your stepdaughter knows that you can be trusted with information which was never yours to share. Anyone who is upset about this should be upset that they weren\u2019t respected enough to have been informed earlier with the news.

There\u2019s probably a reason she wasn\u2019t told before you.", "NTA.\n\nTell the mother that stepdaughter is a grown adult, and you respected her wishes to keep the information to those she choose to tell. State, it is up to stepdaughter who she wishes to know about personal medical details especially so early on in a pregnancy, and it is unreasonable for her to demand that you violate stepdaughter's trust.", "She\u2019s an adult. You\u2019re not obligated to tell her mom. NTA", "It's her news to tell not yours. She trusted you not her mother. Well done.", "NTA\n\nYou respected her choice of who to tell. Her mother is misplacing her anger. She can be mad at her daughter for telling you instead of her (even though I'd bet there's a reason for it lol) but she can't be mad at you for respecting your stepdaughter's wishes.", "NTA.  It was not your story to tell. You were told in confidence and you held that information in confidence.", "NTA the mother should examine how she handled her own relationship with her daughter instead of being mad at you for her daughter trusting you", "\u201c My step daughter\u2019s mother was extremely offended and said I was disgusting for not telling her parents and It was above my pay grade.\u201d\n\nNTA.  Tell her that you step daughter is her priority, not her.  And ask her where that pay has been going to because you haven\u2019t seen it", "Ack, you made it more depressing. But, yeah, that seems possible.", "Yeah, bio mum is very hurt and taking it out on OP. There must be more going on if she didn\u2019t tell her."]}
