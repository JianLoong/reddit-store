That is FULLY recover. Running, jumping, climbing trees, doing your college sport. \n\nMaybe you\u2019re using bone marrow donation as a cover up for anonymity. If you\u2019re donating a kidney or a part of your liver, yes, you\u2019d absolutely lose a season. Because those are full on invasive surgeries, even when done laparoscopically. But bone marrow donation is a very unpleasant needle and some soreness and you\u2019re pretty much healed when it doesn\u2019t hurt any more. \n\nAre there safety protocols in place for your sport or college? That might be a thing. Legal liability trumps medical science sometimes. \n\nIt just feels to me like you don\u2019t have the right information, or maybe this is a troll post to see what happens. \n\nBut to satisfy both, it\u2019s your body, you get to decide.

If you don't feel the need to make the gift, then no amount of pressure should change your mind.  The issue of finishing your education is pertinent, especially because you will lose your scholarship.  Perhaps bio-parents can set up a trust fund to pay for the education for which the scholarship will be lost.

For what it\u2019s worth, from a purely selfish standpoint, giving up your sport and securing separate funding would free up more time and energy for your studies or even a part time job to help you out further financially. And that\u2019s on top of, you know, the life saving. Plus, it probably won\u2019t hurt your chances in interviews if you can slip in that you gave up your athletic scholarship to save your dying brother.

These four things are what matters here. It sounds like you didn't even know of this kid's existence and would never have known if he hadn't gotten sick. You owe nothing to your genetic donors, nor any other offspring they have. I know that sounds cruel and harsh, but they chose to bend to their own parents wishes and basically abandoned you to your adoptive parents. It's wonderful that your parents are great and loving people, but keep in mind that it could have gone horrifically wrong and the very opposite could have been the case. Biologically you have siblings, but that doesn't necessarily make them brothers/sisters to you. You get to choose whether or not you want to accept them as siblings seeing as how you were not raised with either of them and have not had any contact before now. Tell your friends who are saying that you are an asshole for prioritizing school over strangers (because that is what your bio family is to you) that there are many many strangers in the world that could be saved by their organs/marrow/etc and are they willing to put their own life, desires, futures, and bodies on the line for those strangers? The answer will inevitably be no. My recommendation is to let your university know about this issue and that you are declining the testing and donation and anything else these people might try to pull, because who knows what lengths these people will go to and they may try to go behind your back to the university and screw things up for you. In fact, you should probably tell the university that unless they have something signed and notarized by you, and that you handed it to the appropriate office directly in person, while alone and under no duress (or something along those lines) they are to NOT accept it until they can speak with you directly and in person (again alone). One thing you (and your parents) may want to do is keep an eye on the youngest kiddo. Since it sounds like their existence was only to save the sick kid, they may end up being completely ignored and neglected because they are of no use to your bio-parents at this point and it sounds like the sick kid is the one they really wanted. Also tell them to reference that movie \"My Sister's Keeper\" (or some such title as that), because this screams the plot line of that bio-pic if I recall the storyline blurbs correctly (personally never saw it myself, but I do remember hearing about it).", "This is a hard decision and one I wish you didn\u2019t have to make. But some things to consider: why did they wait until your brother needed a marrow transplant before reaching out?

In all fairness, tho, can't blame them for trying to save their kid (well, the one they kept).", "NAH. If it were my son who needed a bone marrow transplant I would do anything possible to get it.  But that doesn't mean that you owe them anything.  Also I'm not a lawyer but I'm sure there are loopholes like the grandparents setting up a private scholarship for their biological grandson.", "NAH - I can't imagine being in your situation. Please try to see your brother and his life apart from having anything to do with your shared parents. As a mom, I'd do anything to save my child. Please count your bio  parents out of this situation and let your decision be based upon saving the life of your brother, much less facing a strangers. No matter what, I hope that whatever choice you make will continue to serve you well in life. If it were me, I'd donate to save someone's life even if it meant I didn't have a free ride. I encourage you to build a relationship with him, he's suffered your parents too. I appreciate your post, it reminds me that I can save lives too, even if it's just plasma but I'm going to sign up for bone marrow too.", "NAH. They asked, you said you have reservations.  Well, they're AHs for having a spare parts kid...\n\nYou should consult a lawyer.  You're bioGPs need to create an educational trust, 529 plan, etc to contribute to your education.  The 2 lawyers can create it in such a way to not have it as a payment for your donating. \n\nIf he needs a donor he's probably on the registry.  You can talk to your doctor.  Ask to have the test & see if you're a match without alerting your bio fam. I think they can do that, but such laws are constantly changing, which is why I say TALK with your doctor,  not there's. \n\nBut honestly, do you really want to be part of a family that has a spare parts kid? Or one that will pay for your college IF you donate. Like seriously?  I'm not going to judge them for putting you up for adoption.  That is a deeply personal choice that I'm sure they didn't make lightly.  But now that they have the resources to care for 2 kids & provide a college education for you, they're only willing to if you make a huge sacrifice. \n\nThat's a lot to think about & it's not an easy choice.", "ESH. The bio parents should not be pressuring you. However, they are trying to save their kid\u2019s life. I\u2019m assuming both of them were tested & weren\u2019t a match. \n\nYour whole dilemma is based on a premise that is probably false, which is that you wouldn\u2019t be able to compete in your sport. You sound pretty uninformed about the actual donation process & the consequences to you of donating your bone marrow. You should talk to a doctor or the bone marrow coordinator to get actual facts because the recovery time is actually very short, on the order of days, & it\u2019s very unlikely that it would interfere with your ability to do anything at all in the future. Many times the cells can be collected via a blood draw, not a surgical procedure. \n\nAs for whether you\u2019re an AH for refusing to donate, assuming you are a match? Put another way, are you an AH for letting another human being die so you can play a game in college? That\u2019s a pretty clear yes. I get the part about the scholarship but it sounds like the bio parents are willing to find a way to cover that without anyone getting in trouble. \n\nI don\u2019t know how much your tuition is, but let\u2019s suppose you didn\u2019t have the scholarship. If someone offered you that much money in return for killing a stranger of their choosing, would it be enough money that you would kill the stranger for them? That\u2019s kind of the moral spot you\u2019re in, your money or their life.", "NAH It is your choice whether to donate or get tested. Of course parents of a child would reach out to all possible donors if it meant that it could save their child\u2019s life, even a child they gave up for adoption when they were young. If you decide that you don\u2019t want to donate then you don\u2019t need to vilify your parents to justify your decision. Referring to yourself and their third child as \u201cspare parts\u201d is cruel.", "Do they ask the donor beforehand? I've heard of so many cases where a family has another child just to be a donor fir the sick one. I would think the majority of children that are in that position are forced to by a parent.", "This!\n\nOP is NTA.  \n\nI believe that, in the US, if the organ/marrow donor tells the medical team that they don't want to donate or that they are being paid (or coerced) by the recipient (or recipient's family), then the donation procedure is cancelled for ethical reasons.\n\nEven if you did donate the marrow, there is no guarantee that it would cure your bio-brother. There's no guarantee that you donor-grandparents would fulfill their ethically-murky deal regarding your education, since your athletic scholarship would be gone.", "The test itself is invasive and will cause them to be unable to play the sport that\u2019s giving them a scholarship.", "\"They aren't entitled to your body just because they created it.\"\n\nYup.  Especially since they gave said body away..\n\n (Not making a judgement on adoption.  Sounds like they did the right thing.  But they don't get to hold biological collateral over OP.)\n\nOP is NTA", "This comment is really important. Should be at the top\n Wish I could upvote you a thousand times. \ud83c\udfc5", "With how they're acting I just know they're treating the 'spare parts' kid like shit since he's not a match. \n\nDefinitely voting NTA.", "It\u2019s like real life My Sister\u2019s Keeper", "That is the OP making a cruel assumption, there\u2019s no evidence for that. There\u2019s no need to vilify the parents here, this is a terrible situation. I vote NAH.", "Thank you for your concern.  It is vine marrow though.  There is another option that does not involve surgery but it involves a drug that has other side effects.", "Stop being an AH ... you should not be guilting him.", "The medics do ask the donors. In private, so that the potential donor has the chance to let them know safely if they're being pressured or coerced, and then they cover for them by telling the recipient that this person has not tested ok to donate. \n\nChildren who are pressured into being tested as donors usually are being forced by a parent. But the parents typically don't know that the medics won't allow an unwilling donor, so they never find out that their kid said no. They just think their kid didn't actually have the medical characteristics to be a donor after all. \n\nSometimes, even with the chance offered to them to refuse, a kid who's grown up believing they have to listen to their parents doesn't say that there's a problem anyway, even if they're not comfortable donating. If they say yes, they want to and it's fine, there's nothing the doctors can do about it; all they can do is offer them a chance to say no, and support them if they take it.", "They ask the questions before they do the tests. Like, they won't even get out the testing equipment before they've asked and gotten an affirmative and thorough \"yes, I'm doing this of my own free will, and neither being coerced nor offered compensation\". All OP would be sacrificing would be an afternoon.", "They won't be asked to undergo the physical tests, even though the family will probably be told that they did. They'll first be asked, \"Are you here freely with no coercion, compensation, etc\" and if you say, \"No, I'm not! My family is trying to force me to do this, but I don't want to,\" that's all they will need to do. After that, the doctors will handle it.", "You\u2019re completely wrong about this. The test is done via a blood draw. A blood draw doesn\u2019t make anyone unable to play a sport.", "This isn't true. The test is a cheek swab.", "Yeah, as is often said around here, just because they're blood doesn't mean they're family.", "Agree \ud83d\udcaf", "Okay, but bone marrow donation is a needle to your hip. They say it doesn\u2019t hurt, but it does, and it isn\u2019t terrible but no pain and some pain are worlds apart for some people. It was definitely uncomfortable.  It wasn\u2019t an actual surgery. \n\nBut you don\u2019t really need a reason to not donate. No is a full sentence. If you don\u2019t want to, then don\u2019t. \n\nIt feels like you\u2019re making a big deal out of the act to justify not doing it.  If you don\u2019t want to do it, then don\u2019t do it!  But be honest about why. You shouldn\u2019t lose a season over bone marrow donation. But you don\u2019t ever have to give any part of your body to anyone without full consent. Full stop. And it\u2019s okay to just not want to do it, even if the relationship was closer than a person you don\u2019t know who shares biological parents with you!", "We said the same thing almost exactly! Nicely done, stereo partner. \ud83e\udd23", "I think he means the bone marrow harvesting process", "As someone who used to coordinate bone marrow and stem cell donations, this. I would be honest because it otherwise sounds like an excuse. And doctors do not want uncommitted donors anyhow\u2014 it can be a lot worse to change mind last minute so being upfront at the beginning is better."]}
