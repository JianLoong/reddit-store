My best friend (and sister in everything but blood) May is Leo's godmother.\n\nShe is the main reason my son is still alive today and she helped even though at that time she was going through medical school.

Neither she or Leo have a close bond, they're friends with each other. Amy has not been a mother figure to Leo nor did I expect him to consider her as one.  She has tried a lot but most of the attempts have ended in failure.\n\nShe saw Leo making a mother's day gift for May and she thought it was for her. And when mother's day came and she didn't get a gift she confronted Leo and asked him about the gift, and he told her that thr gift was for May.\n\nShe came to me and complained about how she deserved a gift and how unfair it is that someone not in a relationship with me gets a gift and how May was a b!tch for taking away her(Amy's) mother son bond with Leo.\n\nI told her that May deserves the gifts more than she does because May helped raise Leo for a majority of his life.

My parents and her parents think I'm being unfair to her and should stop letting May be a part of my son's life.\n\nI don't think I did anything wrong here and I feel like this is a red flag on me and Amy's relationship but I could be wrong here and be the AH", "created_utc": 1684125843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hxums/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_my_best/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She just showed you who she really is.", "NTA - I'd honestly consider how serious the relationship is and consider that a big red flag.", "NTA. Amy's entitlement is a huge red flag. She's been your girlfriend for two years and came into Leo's life in his later teens. She's not married to you and he's too old to need a new parent anyway. He's never going to view her as a mother figure. That will always be May.", "NTA. I hope you seriously reconsider this relationship. No girlfriend should demand a kid get cutoff from their mother figure or become jealous of a support person.", "NTA, she can't just pop up in his life and expect to automatically be a mother figure. Especially without having a bond with one another", "Nta! I'm assuming Leo is 17 at the time of this story, so he is absolutely allowed to choose who he makes a gift for and who he doesn't. It's not like May is forcing him to make one for her, he's almost an adult for crying out loud.", "NTA - in no way should you stop letting May be part of your son's life. She sounds wonderful and you are so lucky to have such a good friend/sister. Your girlfriend, however... yeah, that's a huge red flag. I'm not sure why she would expect a mother's day present from your son and the way she behaved when she found out it wasn't for her is reprehensible. I also would take anything your parents say with a grain of salt, considering it sounds like they ditched you because you wanted to keep and take care of your son. It doesn't sound like they're a good source of advice or support. And her parents are just that - her parents. She sounds bad enough without her personal chorus backing her up.", "I don't like using the term \"red flag\", but you are right. This is a huge red flag. She can't expect to replace May just because you guys are dating. It's some really immature and entitled behaviour. You might want to reconsider this relationship for your son's well-being.", "NTA. The courts look at what is in the best interest of the child. If your GF can't see what you're trying to explain, frame it in those terms. What's in your son's best interests is honoring the person who has been a maternal figure as long as he can remember. Severing that tie would not be in his best interest. Whether he can later build a new bond with your GF will very much be impacted by how she reacts to this situation.", "NTA\n\nMay is Leo's godmother.  She acted more of a mother figure than his actual mother.  As far as I'm concerned, May *is* Leo's mother from what you told us, considering that May has been in Leo's life for just about his entire life.  Of course Leo is going to treat May as his mother!\n\nAmy, on the other hand, has only been with you for two years.  Leo may like Amy, but Amy is not a mother figure to Leo.  He's likely not going to treat Amy as such.  Amy really doesn't 'deserve' a mother's day present (can't think of a better word than 'deserve').\n\nIs it unfair to say that to Amy?  No, because it is true.  Hence NTA.", "NTA. May has been in your son's life 15 years and forgetting the bond you have as friends, she is the one who has acted the closest role to mother for him. Your GF is delusional if she thinks 2 years of interaction with a teen who was 15 when they met entitles her to the mother's card. She is your GF and that doesn't make her your son's mother figure de facto. Please don't cut the other constant positive figure out off his life - he is old enough anyway to have his own relationships with loved ones independent of your wishes. And you managed to go 17 years of friendship with May without it becoming more so your GF is being unnecessarily jealous.\n\nEdit: were your and GF's parents there when you were struggling with a baby, toddler and child? If not, tell them to pound rocks.", "NTA; oh look it\u2019s s bunch of red flags in the shape of your girlfriend", "NTA in my opinion.\nSeems like your son considers May to be the closest thing he has to a mother. Cutting her out of both of your lifes, after all she's done for you would be just cruel and anyone who suggests it is cruel as well.\nAlso: seeing as your parents completely abandoned you and your son for 12 years, they do not get a vote in any of this.\n\nAt most, you could have phrased it a little more delicately to Amy as to why your son would give May a gift instead of her.", "NTA\n\nMay was as close to a mother as your son had for 15 years, but he's supposed to change that in 2 years for your new GF. NOPE.\n\n\nThat's not how that works.\n\nIt is not unreasonable, if you are trying to build a life with Amy, to continue to try to foster a relationship between your son and her, but your son is basically an adult.  He gets to choose how he sees her, and it would be absurd for you to make any demands in this regard.  Amy needs to take your son's lead there, and not push her idea of what their relationship should look like on him.", "It\u2019s a red flag for sure that your parents, hers, and your gf want May to be completely cut off from your sons life. I do somewhat see her side tho and her trying to be somewhat there for Leo but she hasn\u2019t been in his life for very long so she can\u2019t really expect a parental relationship right now.", "Nta\n\nAmy sounds immature if she can't understand May's role.\n\nP. S. I hope these are fake names.", "NTA\n\n>She came to me and complained about how she deserved a gift and how unfair it is that someone not in a relationship with me gets a gift \n\nWtf? Why is she so entitled? The gift is NOT supposed to be given to someone who's \"in a relationship with you\". It was meant for someone who's a mother figure to your son. Tell her to get over herself.\n\nThis woman thinks she'll automatically deserve the \"mother\" title just because she's fucking someone with a kid. That's not how it works. If she wants it, she'll have to earned it.", "Your parents abandoned you when you needed them the most. They get less than 0 input in any of this.

That is a bit odd to me since they should have Leo\u2019s best interest. Is there more to this story?", "Agreed NTA. Also, how old is this girlfriend, because that sounds like very immature, inconsiderate of Leo type behavior. Tell your parents to mind their own business, because it sounds like they're not helping - cut off an important piece of Leo's family for his whole life up until this point to appease a person who's been around for two years? No way. That's not good for Leo or you.", "So what is next? You have to cut ties with May because your GF is \"uncomfortable\" with her relationship with you and your son?", "They are", "They didn't care about Leo for 12 years. I think it's safe to say they don't care about him now either. Probably want op to marry, so that he would lose the \"stigma\" of being a single unmarried dad", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t even married to Amy yet, what an odd assumption for her", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nThis is the biggest reddest flag I have seen today. \n\n1. She is trying to force a mother-son relationship with a 17 year old.\n\n2. She has no regard for the woman that has been a mother figure for him his entire life.\n\n3. Your parents have an opinion about who is in your life after they went no contact for 12 years.\n\n4. She has expectations that your son disregard such a strong connection with May for no reason other than she is your girlfriend \n\n5. She confronted your son with her insecurities \n\nIn my opinion, you should be with May if she is available. Otherwise, find someone that is not in competition for your son's affections and interests.", "NTA. I do think that you should have had a better choice of words, like... just explaining why Leo sees May as a mother, if you say \"Jane Doe has more this than you\" it can be misinterpreted. \n\nHowever: Amy is literally behaving like a 14 year old. She should understand that your friend has been there forever, that she will stay, and that it is more than natural that Leo sees May as his mother figure. While Amy is just someone that has been there a few years and is trying to force this kid to like her, instead of just accepting that if the kid is not bonding with her, it is what it is and it is not even personal. And probably Leo can sense how forced everything with her is.\n\nI do see Amy as a red flag. Telling you to get your best friend out of your life because of her own insecurities? Run while you can. You just don't know what else she will want to control in your life.", "NTA - the fact that your parents seem to be on Amy's side tells you everything you need to know about that relationship. Honestly anyone that things you should rip May from your son's life is just a gutter level awful human being.", "NTA. Amy is showing tremendous disrespect for a relationship you and Leo obviously cherish, and is also pushing for a relationship with Leo that he does not want. She feels entitled to his affection and is wiling to boundary stomp to get it.

If someone was an important part of a child\u2019s life they shouldn\u2019t suddenly be cut off simply because things changed with the adults and they\u2019re not biologivally related. \n\nIt is the opposite mentality of \u201cthe village\u201d in which kids have opportunities to build meaningful relationships and receive mentoring and support from trusted people besides immediate family. Some kids have a hard time and really need that extra opportunity. To cut them off from a supportive mentor for one\u2019s own ease or preference is selfish and unfair.", "NTA.

Keep May whatever happens, she's a star!", "Sometimes the best family is the one you choose.
