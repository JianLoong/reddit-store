She's been your girlfriend for two years and came into Leo's life in his later teens. She's not married to you and he's too old to need a new parent anyway. He's never going to view her as a mother figure. That will always be May.", "NTA. I hope you seriously reconsider this relationship. No girlfriend should demand a kid get cutoff from their mother figure or become jealous of a support person.", "NTA, she can't just pop up in his life and expect to automatically be a mother figure. Especially without having a bond with one another", "Nta! I'm assuming Leo is 17 at the time of this story, so he is absolutely allowed to choose who he makes a gift for and who he doesn't. It's not like May is forcing him to make one for her, he's almost an adult for crying out loud.", "NTA - in no way should you stop letting May be part of your son's life. She sounds wonderful and you are so lucky to have such a good friend/sister. Your girlfriend, however... yeah, that's a huge red flag. I'm not sure why she would expect a mother's day present from your son and the way she behaved when she found out it wasn't for her is reprehensible. I also would take anything your parents say with a grain of salt, considering it sounds like they ditched you because you wanted to keep and take care of your son. It doesn't sound like they're a good source of advice or support. And her parents are just that - her parents. She sounds bad enough without her personal chorus backing her up.", "I don't like using the term \"red flag\", but you are right. This is a huge red flag. She can't expect to replace May just because you guys are dating. It's some really immature and entitled behaviour. You might want to reconsider this relationship for your son's well-being.", "NTA. The courts look at what is in the best interest of the child. If your GF can't see what you're trying to explain, frame it in those terms. What's in your son's best interests is honoring the person who has been a maternal figure as long as he can remember. Severing that tie would not be in his best interest. Whether he can later build a new bond with your GF will very much be impacted by how she reacts to this situation.", "NTA\n\nMay is Leo's godmother.  She acted more of a mother figure than his actual mother.

Of course Leo is going to treat May as his mother!\n\nAmy, on the other hand, has only been with you for two years.  Leo may like Amy, but Amy is not a mother figure to Leo.  He's likely not going to treat Amy as such.  Amy really doesn't 'deserve' a mother's day present (can't think of a better word than 'deserve').\n\nIs it unfair to say that to Amy?  No, because it is true.  Hence NTA.", "NTA. May has been in your son's life 15 years and forgetting the bond you have as friends, she is the one who has acted the closest role to mother for him. Your GF is delusional if she thinks 2 years of interaction with a teen who was 15 when they met entitles her to the mother's card. She is your GF and that doesn't make her your son's mother figure de facto. Please don't cut the other constant positive figure out off his life - he is old enough anyway to have his own relationships with loved ones independent of your wishes.

NOPE.\n\n\nThat's not how that works.\n\nIt is not unreasonable, if you are trying to build a life with Amy, to continue to try to foster a relationship between your son and her, but your son is basically an adult.  He gets to choose how he sees her, and it would be absurd for you to make any demands in this regard.  Amy needs to take your son's lead there, and not push her idea of what their relationship should look like on him.", "It\u2019s a red flag for sure that your parents, hers, and your gf want May to be completely cut off from your sons life.

She should understand that your friend has been there forever, that she will stay, and that it is more than natural that Leo sees May as his mother figure. While Amy is just someone that has been there a few years and is trying to force this kid to like her, instead of just accepting that if the kid is not bonding with her, it is what it is and it is not even personal. And probably Leo can sense how forced everything with her is.\n\nI do see Amy as a red flag. Telling you to get your best friend out of your life because of her own insecurities? Run while you can.

To take her away just to make your gf feel important for things she didnt even do is unreal. At 17, i dont think it really matters, hes almost an adult & can decide on his own.
