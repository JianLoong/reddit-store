Politics were never talked much amongst their family, but they went to a very closed minded church every Sunday without fail. \n\nI met my wife when we were in college when we became best friends but there was always something more there. One night we both got drunk and confessed our feelings and we\u2019ve been together and very happy ever since.\n\nTo her family we were always just roommates and best friends and no one questioned it and that was ok with both of us especially since after my wife and her siblings were out of her parents house they were finally able to develop a real relationship with their parents and my wife was so desperate to hang on to that relationship and approval that she didn\u2019t want to break that. Neither of us have ever fit much into the \u201clesbian couple\u201d stereotypes that they may be familiar with. Both of us have always been very girly, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been hiding it either, we literally bought a house, got cats together, had one another as life partners on insurance. Her family knew all of this under the guise that it was to save money and they figured it was just until we found other people.\n\nA few months ago, my wife and I got married in a very small courthouse ceremony. We had a few professional photos taken and hung some up on the walls in our house we bought together a few years ago with the idea that we would take them down when people were visiting. In the photos we were both wearing less formal wedding dresses but it\u2019s still quite obvious they\u2019re wedding photos.\n\nMy wife\u2019s sister came to visit a few weeks ago, we took the photos around our house down, but my wife and her sister made plans for getting lunch on Friday. Her sister came to her work to pick her up and must have seen the photo on her desk, news got back around to her parents and they were livid that we hadn\u2019t told them and let them think we were just friends, that they would have accepted it. My wife tried to explain that she just wanted a relationship but they\u2019re still upset \u201cthat it never mattered that we were homosexual but that weve been lying to them for years.\u201d They said they need space from us and won\u2019t answer my wife\u2019s calls. This has been devastating to her, she\u2019s cried almost every night over it for hours. I\u2019ve tried to explain to her family but they won\u2019t listen to me or answer my calls either.\n\nAre we the assholes here?", "created_utc": 1696790530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1736j25/aita_for_lying_to_my_wifes_family_for_over_a/", "score": 1579, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She acted on the information she had, which was that she could tell them who she really was *or* keep in contact.  It backfired.\n\nPossible explanation #2:  Your wife's family would have been horrible in the name of performative purity if they had had a clue about the true nature of your relationship.  Now they are claiming otherwise because the discovery that your relationship is not what they thought it was knocked them off balance, and in order to regain control they have to identify a bad guy.\n\nStill NAH.  Just fallible people being fallible.", "The parents are just using the convenient excuse of \u201cyou *lied* to us\u201d, (didn\u2019t clue you \u201cconservative\u201d people into what was going on in your private lives). Using that as the reason they are so hurt! and upset! is a convenient excuse to cover for their homophobia. \n\nAnd you dropped that excuse in their lap, and now they get to parade around their righteous indignation to anybody that will listen. \n\nWell, ya know what? There is no love like Christian hate. I am so sorry. \n\nNTA for just trying to live your lives with as little interference and drama from your family members as you can.", "NTA if I found out one of my children was keeping a decade old secret out of fear of losing our relationship I\u2019d be mortified. I wouldn\u2019t use that as the excuse for being mad. Her parents\u2019 reaction was exactly what you were avoiding. I\u2019d also like to point out that I\u2019m Catholic and that isn\u2019t an excuse for their behavior either. Her parents are wrong on all fronts. You were just trying to keep everyone happy and there is no shame in that or your love for each other.", "NTA. And anyone who isn\u2019t part of the LGBTQ+ can keep their opinions to themselves on this one. I grew up in a Catholic family and was terrified to come out to them. So many sleepless nights crying and worrying that my entire family would shun and ostracize me. Praying to God every day to make me straight. It (obviously) never worked. \n\nLuckily my family did accept me. But we never told my paternal grandmother about me being gay, or my cousin being a lesbian. She was devoutly Catholic and we knew it wouldn\u2019t have gone over well. She died not knowing the truth about us, and I have no regrets about that. She died and our relationship was intact, which was been better than her rejecting us and going NC. \n\nIt\u2019s up to parents to make it clear their children will be loved no matter what. And if you and your wife have been together for this long, with their whole family knowing of your existence, there was definitely willful ignorance going on. \n\nIt\u2019s your and your wife\u2019s choice to come out when you want to. I get they\u2019re upset you \u201ckept it from them\u201d but they have the opportunity to be wholeheartedly supportive of the two of you and they\u2019re not doing it. Instead of trying to see it from your side, they\u2019re making it about themselves. And now they\u2019ve cut off contact which was the last thing your wife wanted. \n\nI really hope they come around soon. I hope you and your wife will be okay. Much love to you both, this is such a challenging situation.", "Nta.

I don\u2019t believe it.", "NTA As a hetero male I can't imagine what you have to navigate as a lesbian couple so I can't judge you for your decision to keep your relationship private. Everyone has aspects of their life that they keep private especially if they think others will be closed minded about their lifestyle.

The anger they feel now is a good example of how they would have reacted.", "Queer AF over here. You are NTA. I understand.", "Your wife was uncomfortable to inform her family about her sexuality. \n\nFOR OVER A DECADE.\n\nErgo, she grew up in an environment where she could not freely be herself.\n\nEVEN AFTER SHE MOVED OUT.\n\nNow her family found out and went NC.\n\n**A** They are angry their daughter didn't inform them, but fail to see that's because THEY never created a trusting environment for your wife to share this.\n\n**B** They are homophobes and the fact your wife didn't inform them is a great excuse for them to go NC without having to out themselves as homophobes.\n\nIn both cases NTA", "This:\n\n>it never mattered that we were homosexual but that weve been lying to them for years.\n\nis bullshit. \n\nIf your sexuality really didn't matter to them, they would be sad and guilty that you both felt the need to hide it from them. Instead they are punishing you for being a same-sex couple without admitting that's what they are doing. \n\nIn other words, their reaction now justifies your decision to keep the truth from them. Your wife knew her parents would react badly, and now they are.\n\nI hope you can both get a little relief from no longer having to hide it, at least. It's sad that it happened this way though.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to you being out. \n\nThey say it doesn't matter, but they are ultimately still using it as an excuse to cut contact rather than being mortified that their daughter thought they wouldn't accept her, and that's telling.\n\nBecause that would be my reaction... I would be sad for my kiddo, heartbroken at the idea that they worried and felt they had to hide...  and wonder how I could fix the fact that they were afraid they *could* lose me.\n\n If it's not true, then it's a failure on their part to be clear and honest with their kids. You didn't hide your relationship to be malicious, and everyone knows that.", "NTA\n\nWhat a shame that you felt the need to hide all these years. But you did for a reason. \n\nThey could have been hurt but reassuring. That they aren't speaking to you makes me think the homophobia isn't far below the surface.", "girl, yall bought a house together. it is 2023 and they still believed yall were only roommates??? they\u2019re just upset they have to confront yall being gay now \ud83d\ude44 im sorry for yall.

If I found out my kid had kept a secret out of fear from me I would be apologizing to them so much for not making them feel they could tell me. You don\u2019t owe these self centered people anything", "NTA. Your wife's family never fostered a relationship with her that would make her feel safe to tell them about this, and they are angry because of the consequences of their own actions, so are trying to push the blame from themselves onto your wife.", "NTA, they should reflect on why they made their daughter think she would have lost them. Also, sister is TA, what she did is traumatic and violent", "Nobody holds onto \"you didn't tell me\" anger for weeks over something like this.  They're holding onto this because it is more socially acceptable than \"you're gay\".  \n\nLoving parents forgive their children for transgressions of the \"kept a secret\" variety quickly, even if they do initially respond with anger and hurt feelings.", "sounds like this is the parent's fault, for bringing up her kid thinking she had to fear them and keep important facts from them, or they would have flipped out.\n\nand now they ARE flipping out....so a self-fulfilling prophecy!  :)", "I think it\u2019s fair for them to be hurt but not mad at you they need to think about the image they project if yall didn\u2019t feel comfortable being out around them.", "As someone who grew up in a Catholic family and knows the Catholic doctrine on homosexual relationships I understand where your wife was coming from. \n\nKnowing how my own family reacts to people of the alphabet persuasion is sometimes hit and miss, and I can see how she would be cautious.", "NTA's but the sister is.\n\nGive it time.

I would be devastated if my kids lied to me for 10 hrs about their partner. Not because they lied but I have failed as a parent if they feel they can\u2019t tell me. This is a them problem.

My heart breaks for her", "If my child spent ten years hiding something from me, I'd wonder what I did wrong for them not to trust me with that information.", "NTA. You and your wife don't owe her family (or anyone) the right to hear about your romantic lives. \n\nHer family is right to be upset, but not with you or your wife.

It's ok for them to say they would have accepted it after the fact.", "In the 80s some called it \"straightening up\" or *de-queering* the house.  Are y'all a-holes?  Not really.  Coming out to family is always a ticklish situation, and only your wife could make that decision to come out to her family.  But I do understand the family's disappointment for not being there.  And FYI, roommates for 10 years? And no one questioned? Yeah, they probably questioned when you weren't around, waiting for her to say something.", "Based on what you posted, I think her parents may have said homophobic things in her home as a child & that is why she felt like they wouldn\u2019t accept it. My partners family is Uber religious as well & made similar comments in the name of \u2018religion\u2019. So much so that a very close family member won\u2019t come out to anyone cuz they don\u2019t feel they\u2019d be accepted!  Sorry you\u2019re going through it. Just love her & comfort her as best you can & listen. Hopefully the parents will get over it.

As contrary as it sounds, you may find help from an LGBTQIA\u2019s accepting Catholic Priest to help navigate the next period in your relationship with your wife\u2019s family.

I know my dad was. He didn't like missing out on his daughter's life, even if it wouldn't have changed much of their interactions.\n\nYou're NTA.

They even got married years ago and my aunt invited no one from her side of the family and never told anyone.\n\nOnce my mom & other aunt found out, they were more hurt than anything. Mom always thought they were all very close and my aunt lived this life that she never shared with them.\n\nOh, and slight AH. You both purposely left family out of moments and experiences in your life. That's probably what hurts the most for them.", "INFO: Other than being conservative and religious, has your wife's family given any indication that they wouldn't be accepting of an LGBT+ child?", "Nah\nI don't believe them.

Who knows\n\nI do know as a parent, I\u2019d have all the feels to miss a major milestone in my kids\u2019 lives. They are definitely feeling that too.\n\nSince they are pretty regularly attending Catholics, I hazard a guess they are better catechized than most. Big T Truth is a big deal. If so, having your relationship concealed from them is a lie of omission and hard to accept because Truth and truth are important to them.\n\nAnd something that is really misunderstood about Catholic families\u2014everybody thinks we\u2019re puritanical and excommunicate our members. We just have non-practicing members. We have large families with lots of colorful stories about family members going against Church teaching and still having a valued place in the family.

Her parents worship at a church that openly hates you both, so it's pretty understandable you'd be wary of them. You tried to keep it a secret but slipped up so it's not even your fault they found out. \n\nThat's not going to help your wife who had only achieved a comfortable relationship with her parents through lying though. That's just going to take time and being reassured that it's not her fault.", "NTA You didn't lie your wife did, and you backed her play which is exactly what you are supposed to do. You are 1000% in the right here, bulletproof. Your wife is still mostly right and not the asshole either.

Given how much risk there is with coming out and the fact that it seems like the family was willfully ignorant, I understand the decisions made. \n\nIf straight people want queer family to be comfortable coming out, then they need to make it clear that it is safe to do so.", "NTA.

I mean, you could also say that it was like \"don't ask don't tell\", a thing many families do. It seems to me that they didn't want to hear the truth and so you just kind of played along.\n\nETA: And this whole turning a blind eye to things they think is a sexual sin is a catholic thing anyways. How many priests and bishops and so on are secretly gay? How many heterosexual clergy members have affairs? Some priests even live with their girlfriends in one house. People know.

I can understand a bit why your wife thought her parents would lose their minds at knowing she was a lesbian coming from a very religious family, but lying to them was the wrong way to go about it.

I know other Catholics who are okay with the LGBTQ community, so maybe my views are different. \nAnd in this economy, having roommates isn't unusual at all, so people saying they didn't put pieces together are crazy. People are either living with their parents or living with roommates. Owning a home has become a pipe dream for millenials. OP and her wife are lucky to even own a place. Most millenials don't. \n\nYou guys really hurt her family with this. If they are truly homophobic, then yes, I agree with your approach. But since there was no conversation about it, I'd give the benefit of the doubt. And this was wrong on so many levels. Even if the parents didn't accept, maybe the siblings would.

Politics were never talked much amongst their family, but they went to a very closed minded church every Sunday without fail. \n\nI met my wife when we were in college when we became best friends but there was always something more there. One night we both got drunk and confessed our feelings and we\u2019ve been together and very happy ever since.\n\nTo her family we were always just roommates and best friends and no one questioned it and that was ok with both of us especially since after my wife and her siblings were out of her parents house they were finally able to develop a real relationship with their parents and my wife was so desperate to hang on to that relationship and approval that she didn\u2019t want to break that. Neither of us have ever fit much into the \u201clesbian couple\u201d stereotypes that they may be familiar with. Both of us have always been very girly, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve been hiding it either, we literally bought a house, got cats together, had one another as life partners on insurance. Her family knew all of this under the guise that it was to save money and they figured it was just until we found other people.\n\nA few months ago, my wife and I got married in a very small courthouse ceremony. We had a few professional photos taken and hung some up on the walls in our house we bought together a few years ago with the idea that we would take them down when people were visiting. In the photos we were both wearing less formal wedding dresses but it\u2019s still quite obvious they\u2019re wedding photos.\n\nMy wife\u2019s sister came to visit a few weeks ago, we took the photos around our house down, but my wife and her sister made plans for getting lunch on Friday. Her sister came to her work to pick her up and must have seen the photo on her desk, news got back around to her parents and they were livid that we hadn\u2019t told them and let them think we were just friends, that they would have accepted it. My wife tried to explain that she just wanted a relationship but they\u2019re still upset \u201cthat it never mattered that we were homosexual but that weve been lying to them for years.\u201d They said they need space from us and won\u2019t answer my wife\u2019s calls. This has been devastating to her, she\u2019s cried almost every night over it for hours. I\u2019ve tried to explain to her family but they won\u2019t listen to me or answer my calls either.\n\nAre we the assholes here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "\u2026they were roommates!", "When I was introduced to my cousin\u2019s \u201croommate\u201d as a young child at a family event-my first thought was are they girlfriends and if they are why are the adults not just saying it? After a while it became pretty clear everyone knew the truth and it wasn\u2019t a big deal I don\u2019t know if some of the older generation just needed time or what but by the time they married everyone in our family was happy for them. \n\nNow it may be that I was a particularly insightful child but I\u2019m honestly surprised her family are surprised. Surely by this point if they saw them at all, some of them had at least guessed. I definitely wonder if the family was in denial and didn\u2019t want their illusion shattered.", "NAH", "NAH.", "NTA.\n\nI feel like the parents should REALLY be horrified that they gave their daughter the impression that she couldn't come out to them. \n\n\nThen they should do everything they can to show that she was wrong. \n\n\nI feel their actions here might just be homophobia, but they know better than to prove her right, so they latch on to \"*you lied to us*\" to go low-contact.", "NTA there is obviously a reason she felt she had to hide it and you being a good partner respected that and had her back. I feel like they are just saying that now to save face because they know they caused  this secretive behavior due to fear of judgement and   fear of rejection and losing that relationship. They don\u2019t want to accept that responsibility so they are acting accepting in order to paint you both as the bad guys and them the victims!! I guarantee you if you both would of come to them openly they would of been everything but accepting and happy! Trust me I have a very similar religious up brining and my parents reaction was anything but joyous! I recommend telling them this and let them know the ball is in their court and if that would of been the case now is their chance to forgive and prove it!!! Sending love and healing to you all.", "NTA", "NTA. Your wife's family didn't make her feel safe enough to come out to them. That's on them. They suck. Hopefully they'll come around for your wife's sake. Maybe they'll question the behaviour that made her feel unable to confide in them.", "Nta. \n\nI'm not gay, but I know what it's like to be treated like I am and thrown out of the house among other things that happened to me growing up. I'm no contact with my mum and her family for a lot of reasons. \n\nI'm sorry your wife is going through this. Hopefully since they must have known about this for years, they'll get over it. I know my relatives wouldn't have and they're not even religious, they're just ass holes. She has a chance still. Just let them have their tantrum, let them chill the hell out. She may have lost them for good and if that's so, get her into therapy asap, be her rock. Rally any and all friends around you she doesn't feel so alone. There is that slight slither of hope that they'll come around and it will all be OK since there's absolutely no way they didn't know already. If they didn't they're either lying or are very stupid. \n\nHell, when I was a teen and was confronted by my first gay friend who just came out, it took me a good day to get used to it. This was in the 00s and after all I'd gone through it was a weird concept to me. I kicked my own ass for feeling weird because there was nothing wrong with it and nothing had changed, beyond us now both fighting over cute guy posters in magazines. I got anything Tom Welling! Thank goodness Buffy was a good role model because people around me were very homophobic. I luckily had no religion teaching me bad things about people as well. \n\nI really, really hope their love for their daughter will prevail. I really do. Neither of you have done anything wrong. I'm sorry she's suffering because of her relatives.", "NTA, honestly, by your description, I really thought that they would go off the rails but funny enough, my parents seemingly didn't freak out over 40 years ago when my sister came out as gay. Give them time, find a friend or relative who can mediate and apologize for underestimating them. Good luck", "NTA - You were trying to navigate difficult circumstances. Who knows if the family had handled it well back then or not. I have seen it both ways with conservative families, including within my (m) wife's family and in regard to her sister. One of the reasons we made sure our kids knew that we would never have a problem with it. As long as they were happy, we were happy. There was no right choice here, you made the best decision based on what you knew. \n\nIt will work itself out. Just be there for your spouse.", "No. NTA. \n\nTrust your wife's gut. She felt the relationship with her family would crumble if she came out, she was probably right. It would have.  Now that they have known you for years, got used to you two always being together, and having an inkling that you might be more then friends, they have to place their anger in a society acceptable format. So they are hanging their hats on the \"lying\" and deception part and not how they if they were honest would have behaved. It might also be that they didn't get to be apart of the wedding. They might see your courthouse elopement as you stealing precious milestones away.\n\nGive them time, but you both did what was needed to protect yourselves. Don't let the extended family drive a wedge and throw blame for their fabricated hurts along with their disappointment hurt of just missing out.", "NTA.

It\u2019s a very real thing to be disowned, abused, mistreated for your sexuality.

They were absolutely convinced that you were just gal pals.    \n\n\nLet them be mad.  Your wife didn't tell them because she knew -exactly- how they would react.  Because she's heard them.  I can guarantee they've made comments in her presence.  Maybe knowing she was lesbian, maybe just general homophobia.  but you know the comments.  \"Why do -they- have to be on TV.\"  or other such snide remarks that tell you exactly how they felt.  \n\n\nHer family is mad because they KNOW they sinned.

Secondly though we are devastated that you felt the need to keep this a secret. We have so much work to do on ourselves because we sent you all the wrong signals. We are so sorry. Let\u2019s plan a reception for the extended family if you want. We want everyone to know we are loud and proud of you.\u201d\n\nAll this crap about you lying is just smoke to cover up their bigotry and allow them to avoid responsibility in this mess.", "They're lying bigots, and their behavior shows why you were right to keep your relationship secret from them all these years.
