The poor girl finally makes steps towards an outside life and you want to shut it down. Ash claims you have always looked down on her family. I kind of believe it since you think you don't know what to expect from the bf and you haven't met him. She doesn't know your two friends from work, but she was ok with them coming. Lady, get over yourself.", "YTA, but Ash sounds awesome. Sending back the gift and the cash value of the gift, that\u2019s legendary.", "YTA. You treated her like shit and then asked for your gift back? What kind of person does that?", "YTA you want to bring coworkers to a family bday party and tell the host to not bring her bf? That alone is crappy. So because you\u2019re embarrassed, you want to take back a gift?\nWTH. Grow up.", "You gave her a gift - the gadget - and when she didn\u2019t plan a party for you, you asked for it back? Why? It was a gift. \n\nAdding, while tradition has been that she\u2019s planned parties for people\u2019s birthdays, you might want to check in with the party planner before you go inviting other people. Like you had no clue about any details and you went ahead and invited others? That\u2019s quite presumptuous. You were worried about her boyfriend not having met anyone, but your coworkers will be even more out of place with your family. \n\nI can\u2019t even understand how you\u2019d come to the impression that you\u2019re correct in any of this. Of course YTA. You owe her an apology and owe her the gadget back. It was a freaking gift!", "YTA \n\nAsh is right. You have been looking down on her and her choices which are listed below from your own words. And asking for the gift back is not only cheap but very petty. So in addition that YTA, you\u2019re an insincere giver and juvenile. \n\n>Ash was always a weird, emo kid and I never really felt ok with her until 5 years ago, when Anna shared with my husband that Ash is a high functioning autist, it all made sense then\n\n>but Ash's weirdness has extended, she no longer goes out, and when she does she almost never speaks, just keeps her headsets on and stays in her world\n\n>I asked her not to, because we still don't know her boyfriend, and from what I know her mom doesn't know him either so I wouldn't like my coworkers to get the wrong impression on my husband's family. There will be plenty of chances, I told her, but this is my birthday and I prefer to enjoy it without any strange surprises", "YTA.\n\n\"it was only fair that I got back the gift we gave her\" - NOPE. There was nothing fair about it since you're a grown up who gave a gift and retaliated when you didn't get something you wanted and demanded it back. What are you, 5?!\n\n\"she instead called my husband and told him to just keep it and stay away from them\" - GOOD! \n\n\"My husband is now mad at me and I can't understand why\" - since you are confused: you demanded back a gift you BOTH gave his niece.", "YTA\n\nYou clearly assumed the party was for you, without having actually communicated and asked that of Ash. So you got carried away in your need to control other people's parties, and when you got pulled back to reality by Ash, you demanded back a birthday gift you gave Ash months ago. And now you're banned from her spectacular parties. And your husband is mad at you too.", "YTA. You should have never asked for the gift back, it\u2019s extremely immature on your part. Second, she\u2019s 28, she should be allowed to bring her bf. Especially if she is autistic, this may be an extreme comfort for her.", "YTA. A huge one. This entire post reeks of ableism. You keep describing normal symptoms of autism to try and tell us how \"weird\" she is. She's not weird. She's autistic and acting like she has autism. \n\nThe party was shared with her brother. You have no right to tell the host who they can invite when it's not exclusively your event. You're so fixated on appearances it's embarrassing. It's 2023. If your coworkers can't handle someone being visibly autistic, they're also assholes. \n\nI don't like you. And I don't respect you.", "Wonder what she will plan for your husband's divorce party?

Use the money Ash gave you and attempt to buy some class.", "YTA - The point of the gift is to give without the expectation of receiving anything. Also who the fuck gets to tell someone that is planning a party that they can't invite whoever they want to invite? That's insane.

Here's the thing about gift giving. Once it's been given, you have no right to ask for it back. As it now belongs to the recipient and they are under no obligation to return it, especially when it's been almost two months. \n\nEven so, here is my gift to you in the form of some advice: Stop being such a snark and get over yourself.

I love her.\n\nYTA  you invited strangers to the party .\nGeez, if my niece asked to bring her boyfriend, I'd say sure and ask what he likes to drink", "YTA. Was it a present/gift, or was it payment for services? You say it was a gift, but asking it be returned when the party plan changed indicates you see it as payment. \n\nNowhere in your post do you say you asked Ash to plan your party. It reads like you assumed the party would be for you and her brother. \n\nAlso, did your opinion of Ash change before or after she started planning parties and introducing you to new foods? Because I have a hunch it was around the same time.", "YTA\n1. You very clearly look down on her by the way you repeatedly call her names and think her choice of boyfriend would mean anything at all to you or your coworkers \n2. You\u2019re very clearly using her to get a party\n3. Your gift to her has nothing to do with the party and you\u2019re a mega AH for asking for it back\n4. You\u2019re entitled and a user. Get your head out of your ass and plan your own bday.", "The way you talk about Ash is truly horrendous, and your sense of entitlement is embarrassing. The audacity to give someone a gift and then try to take it back because you feel she owes you? A grown adult name calling another adult because their different (neurodivergent.) I think it\u2019s pretty obvious why Ash would rather keep to herself if the alternative is to put up with your bs. OP is a mean girl, insults Ash and treats her poorly all whilst still expecting her to throw a party in OP\u2019s honour, despite how obvious you dislike her. You still expect someone you don\u2019t like to provide services for you over a gift? YTA.", "YTA \n\n1. You are an ableist. Even after knowing her condition you continue to label Ash weird. As you stated you\u2019ve never met her boyfriend but is quick to assume that he might be weird just like her and don\u2019t wanted your co-workers to see that. Pure ableist mentality\n\n2. You are entitled. As Ash said, the party was not for you but you just claimed it as such. Even if it was for you, it was also a party for her brother. He\u2019s also entitled to have guests. He\u2019s allowed to have his sister\u2019s bf at the party. You cannot demand only your guests are welcome at a joint party. You are a Self important entitled AH. \n\n3. You are an embarrassment to your husband. It was a gift. Do you know what a gift is? There was no conditions attached to the gift but yet you demanded it back when things didn\u2019t go your way. Your behavior is vile. \n\n4. You do look down upon your husband\u2019s family. The financial background of the Ash\u2019s family was irrelevant to the story but you find the need to include that in here. That clearly shows what you think of them.", "YTA. WTF. Read what you wrote and say again how you don\u2019t look down on them. \n\nThis is you not being condescending? Yikes", "YTA.  Time to start planning and hosting your own birthday party.  Heaven forbid you have to deal with the weird and emo person, and good on her for telling you off.  (oh, and your entire post is 'looking down on her' so you can stop trying the 'we have never done so', because YOU definitely have and are.)  Hopefully she planned a nice party for HER BROTHER that you were not invited to.", "YTA. You seem to hate Ash and only want her around when it benefits you. She was good when she was planning your party. Enjoy the gadget. .", "YTA, let me count the ways\n1. You admittedly didn\u2019t like her until you found out she had a disability (which probably isn\u2019t even liking her, it\u2019s pitying her)\n2. You wanted to bring your coworkers (who your husbands family has also never met) to a function that was supposed to be for you AND your nephew. \n3. You automatically assumed because you never met your niece\u2019s boyfriend that he would be terrible and send a bad image (he didn\u2019t even have a cover to judge and you already did)\n4. Gifts are not about receiving anything in return, yet you made it about monetary value and not getting your way (yet she has autism and still critically thinks better)\n5. I teach children of this kind of population and they you just talk down about her is disgusting. If you can\u2019t understand why your husband is mad you need serious help.", "Seriously, YTA. How entitled and rude. She hadn't met your coworkers either. She was well withienn her rights to bring her boyfriend to the party she created. You killed the goose.", "Who do you think you are to invite two friends from work but try to dis-invite her boyfriend from **brother's** birthday dinner because \"I don't know him\"? Did she know your coworkers? I'll guess not. What if your coworkers are rude like you? \n\nYou assumed the party was for you. Why? It makes much more sense it would be for her brother, whom she's way closer to. The world does not revolve around you. You're old enough to know that. Practice some self-awareness and reflection.\n\nAlso, it's funny how the autistic person has better social skills than you do. Pretty much everyone knows it's **beyond** tacky to demand a gift back like that. \n\nYTA\n\nYou spent half this post talking about how weird she was, but oh--turns out she's autistic so you guess it's fine? As an autistic person, I don't think somebody needs a disability pass to justify being themselves. They don't need to be autistic for you to decide it's acceptable for them to be different. She's a little \"weird\"? So what? So *what*? Why are you so put off by it? I doubt she was hurting anyone.", "YTA\n\nAsh returning your gift annnnd the cash equivalent was EPIC\ud83e\udd23\n\nAsh said she don't need your gift, your money nor your physical presence", "YTA. Good for the girl for sticking up for herself and dumping the toxic waste", "So uh it's okay to have Ash do all the planning for family parties but she can't bring her boyfriend? She can't bring her boyfriend to the party she's planning for her own brother? She can't bring her boyfriend to the party she's planning for her brother but that she okayed your bringing two co-workers to?\n\nBoy oh boy, are you ever TA. \n\nGot to wonder whether you only ever see Ash with headphones on because that's the only way she can stand to be around your AH self.", "I see you conveniently left out your age..doesn\u2019t matter, because you\u2019re acting like an entitled, spoiled, snobby, high schooler.

It is in extremely poor taste to ask for a gift to be returned. Did you really not know who the party was for? Why would you invite guests to a party someone else was planning? Why on earth not have a dinner with the BF? It\u2019s dinner. Not a vacation with a stranger.", "YTA. You don't decide who comes to the party Ash plans.

If you expect something in return, it's not a gift it's a business deal.\nShe didn't agree to a business deal and has returned your 'deposit'.\n\nOf course she's organising the party out of love for your husband, you married in to her family.\nIt's perfectly normal for her to want to bring her bf and if your coworkers judge you on him then they're AHs too.", "Keep doubling down.

I bet she is SO relieved to not have to deal with you this year. She's probably hoping this means she won't have to deal with you at all anymore, since, you know, she's \"so weird\".

Regardless I always felt entitled to enjoy the parties Ash organizes because, you know, she obviously owes me. And this last party she was doing was also supposed to be all about me (who cares that it\u2019s her brother\u2019s birthday and Ash hosting it, right) but she refused to alter the guest list at my demand.
