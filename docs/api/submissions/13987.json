You do you! Your mom is likely from the generation that thinks that every bit of body hair must be waxed, shaved or plucked in order for your body to be clean/acceptable (not true). I am from that generation as well (though I've tossed a lot of those ideas now that I am older), and I pass no judgment on people who opt to NOT do those things. You have agency over your own body and as long as you are showering, there's nothing offensive about it.  \n\n\nETA: When I work from home and I am not getting gross and sweaty, I do 2-3 showers a week as well. I see nothing wrong with that.", "Your body, your hair, your decision. I barely wax and guess what, if you care look away!\n\nWhy would women be forced to shave/wax but not men?

That he should wear sleeves so that his underarm hair isn't showing? Bc for real some people feel that way, and I'd say N A H if your mom just wants everyone dressed \"properly\" and not showing their armpit hair.", "NTA. It's sad that your mom is unable to see past her social conditioning. Most men don't shave their armpit hair, does she think most men are unhygienic? I doubt it.\n\n\"Common respect\" would be not commenting on whether someone shaves their body hair. Your mom must live a very privileged existence if this is her biggest problem.", "100% NTA \nSorry that you have to endure that.

Nothing wrong with having body hair in your own home. Sounds like Mom has some dated attitudes.", "Is she disgusted with underarm hair on men?", "Showering daily strips all your natural oils off and isn't necessary unless you have a sweaty job.

Heck, some are even dying their underarm hair bright colors.", "Even if you were going to work every day you don't need to shave. If you are clean and don't stink it's fine to have armpit hair that reaches your feet.  \n\nI would ask a friend or relative (who will be honest) if you do actually smell. Hair holds onto odour better than skin so if there's sweat trapped in your hair it will smell bad quicker. A deodorant doesn't stop you sweating, it just adds a nice fragrance on top which is why it has to go on clean skin. \n\nEven when sitting around studying you still sweat and shed skin cells and you can get so used to your own smell you don't notice body odor. 17 is a tough age for this too, I had to shower a lot more often at 17 than I do in my thirties. Hormones are a bitch. \n\nIf someone you trust says you have a bit of a whiff, either shower every day or have a 'pits n bits' bath where you wash your armpits, vulva and buttcrack with a soapy flannel. Takes five minutes. \n\nIf they say you smell fine, tell your mom to go take a leap. I suspect it's this as she's on at you about shaving rather than washing, but it's always a good idea to check. Either way she could have approached this better so NTA.", "NTA at all ! I've shave mine for maybe 10 years and idc what people thinks about that !

Maybe try showing it to your mother so she understands that this isn't as big of deal as she's making it out to be. The removal of body hair was normalized by razor companies to sell more razors (no actually).", "NTA. Funny story, back when I was in high school, a classmate of mine stopped shaving her legs during our final year.

You do you. On the flip side when I asked for recommendations on a new razor (I personally like shaving my underarms and lower legs) I got all this weird shit about not letting a man tell me what to do and shit.

She needs to deal with it.\n\nFun fact, while hair removal has been practiced for thousands of years across the world, it only became really normalized in western cultures during the 20s because new more revealing clothes (flapper dresses) bared more skin and razor companies and advertisers seized the opportunity to increase revenue by marketing to women that they should shave off their hair. \n\nDon\u2019t let her shame you for your body, especially for a \u201cproblem\u201d that was created with the intent to sell products.", "Yup, body hair is and should be a *personal* preference. \n\nNow, if OP was actually whatever on body hair, she could tell her mom that if she wants it gone, mom should pay for professional sugaring or lazer hair removal -- or something similar that lasts longer than just shaving.

She isn't going to stop, the socialized idea of women's body hair as being disgusting is too engrained.
