Last year I was very clear on how hurt this made me and I begged him not to do it again. He promised me it wouldnt happen again. This year it happened again. So instead of crying about it I just told him to do whatever he wanted on my birthday weekend and I will be going to my parents house that weekend. I made plans to go out for karaoke with some friends. I did not invite my boyfriend because he already made plans on my birthday. I wasn\u2019t in the mood to beg him to show up. Last year I begged him for weeks not to ditch me on my birthday. His friends bought tickets to a sport event he really wanted to go to. And he kept begging me to go to the event. But I hate sports. I wanted a bday party with my friends. So finally a week before my birthday I sobbed and begged him please don\u2019t ditch me on my birthday. So he didn\u2019t in the end. But it took lots of convincing on my end. I had to tell his own friends for him \u201cX can\u2019t come because it\u2019s my birthday\u201d. X is a people pleaser and can\u2019t say no to people. This year I just didn\u2019t want to beg him. I didn\u2019t want to tell his friends he can\u2019t come to whatever they had planned. I told him the next day I went out and he was angry at me and said he wanted to come out with me. He said if he knew I was \u201cdoing something fun\u201d on my bday he would have joined me. I told him it\u2019s his responsibility as my partner to not make other plans on my birthday and if he keeps forgetting that\u2019s on him. I said it\u2019s not my responsibility to force you to show up for my birthday. He is angry and not talking to me.

Because he doesn't care about you.", "NTA\n\nForgetting about your SO's birthday is bad, but it is understandable that a poorly-organized person could make.

You allowed the disrespect for quite sometime.", "NTA. He sounds childish. He needs to have his needs pleased on your birthday? He can\u2019t just do whatever you want to do?

It's like those men who are \"pillars of the community \" and then go home and torture their wife and children. Charity begins at home, or with the people who are closest to you.
