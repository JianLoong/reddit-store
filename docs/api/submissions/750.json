She is asking you to give her your child and then failed to attend your wedding? They gets upset when you didn't send her photos of the wedding she chose to miss on the  day. She needs help to process her own grief. I don't think this is her being nasty.", "I'm so sorry for your loss... \nYou're definitely NTA!\nIt's been a year and she makes such despicable and horrifying thing! Especially over photos that you sent her THE NEXT F*CKING DAY! \nI'd strongly recommend you think through her role in your life and consider going low contact with her\nI wish you find a more understanding environment for your recovery", "NTA... my father in law posted a card that my mil was writing us but never finished a few months after she died. Never warned us. Getting mail from a dead loved one was a gut punch.", "NTA. It sounds as if your mother is dealing very poorly with the death of her husband/your father, but that is really no excuse.", "She flat out thinks that she doesn't need help. What am I to do in this situation?", "How do I get her that sort of help?", "I really appreciate this a lot, especially since I have a daughter who doesn't even need to be around behavior like this, I thought her behavior was just because she wasn't taking it well and now she's just trying to go out of her way to make me miserable. I'll do what I can to have minimal contact with her.", "I'm still having a hard time processing that he's still gone.", "Unfortunately you may need to put your own well-being first. If she won't listen to you it could be time to limit contact with her. This sounds harsh but you have your future to think of.", "With your daughter in the picture, it becomes even more horrifying. You've mentioned she told you to give her your daughter. Like, F*CK NO, ma'am, THE AUDACITY! Take care of your daughter and take care yourself.", "I'm sorry. I lost a friend at the start of covid- a young mom. It was so sudden that my brain couldn't process that she was gone, so I decided to just talk to her. Tell her how she was missed and about how her family is, and her horse. I found it was a way to say goodbye, and get out all the things I should have said while she was alive. It helped. I dont know if you would find it weird", "She's been saying things like \"God forbid anything happens to you, your husband can give her to me\" I just don't understand why she's doing this after my dad has passed away.

You definitely do not want that vile woman to raise your daughter as her \u201cdo-over baby\u201d and turn her into her little mini-me.
