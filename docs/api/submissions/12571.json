He always inevitably goes back to using though, and his son is actually under my care after he was removed from his and his gfs home when they were arrested for child endangerment for using with my nephew present. \n\nI was told when I agreed to take custody of my nephew that neither my brother nor his gf are allowed to visit without a social worker supervising. If they found out either was visiting unsupervised they would remove my nephew from my care. That hasn't been an issue with his gf because she basically ran off once she had the opportunity, but in the random spans of time that my brother has been clean, he has visited with supervision. \n\nRecently, my brother was arrested again and is in jail until his hearing or until someone signs him out. There is no bail associated, but the catch is that you have to agree to be responsible for him, either by signing him in to rehab or by allowing him to live with you. Obviously none of his druggie friends have the ability to sign him out because of their own issues with the law, so he called me and asked if I could sign him out. \n\nI told him no, that I wasn't willing to agree to be responsible for him. He said it was a non issue because he was going to go back to rehab. I said that I hoped he did, but that I wasn't willing to put my name on the line (and therefore what little security my nephew has) on his word, because he's lied to me before. \n\nHe called me an asshole, said I wasn't being supportive of his efforts to get clean, and that I needed to stop holding his disease against him and he hung up the phone on me. \n\nI feel bad because I more than anything want him to get clean and I'm not sure that will happen in jail.

And the police. It'd be great too if you have a system which alerts police but IDK if that's expensive or not. Maybe buy pepperspray and other defensive items too. Ugh. I hate that this is happening.

Added stress about him is just too much", "Yea, that's why she's NTA for saying no.", "If he\u2019s ready to get sober then \u201cany old rehab\u201d will be good enough to support his efforts to change for good. The rehabs he attends are not the problem!", "Really tricky - most unfortunate of all is that better structures are not in place to assist people like your brother and there is an over-reliance on family members to take responsibility which for some people (like your brother) is just not suitable. Wishing you good luck!", "Yeah, you shouldn't do a damn thing until you talk to the social worker.\n\nAs for taking your brother to rehab (***IF*** you can). That's your call. I recently had to sign my brother out of a police station after he got his umpteenth DUI. He had already been in outpatient rehab several times but this time he went to inpatient, and it seems to be sticking. He's close to your brother's age. He's going to meetings regularly, avoiding situations where he might be tempted (he's even passing on going to our close cousin's wedding) and he's making friends with other sober people.\n\nThe point is that you can never really predict when sobriety is going to catch, and there's also no guarantee that cooling his heels in jail will make a lick of difference either. I will tell you that your brother is reaching an age when rehab is most likely to actually start working. There's something about the combination of addiction and youth that makes sobriety very, very difficult.\n\nI lean toward the opinion that jailtime doesn't actually help, but rehab might. I can only imagine this in the context of my brother, so I'm not going to be so arrogant as to say that my thoughts and opinions apply to you.\n\nThere is one thing that you might want to consider. When he finally does get serious about getting sober, will he need your moral support? And will that support be put in jeopardy if you leave him in jail?\n\nFor now, you can tell your brother that it's a moot point until you talk to the social worker. And since I'm painfully aware of the difficult choices being put in front of you, you definitely NTA. Godspeed my friend.\n\nEdit: One more thing. If you're in the US and your brother is non-religious and doesn't like AA, look up SMART Recovery. Its spread wide and far across the country at this point, and it uses evidence-based techniques primarily derived from CBT. Many inpatient rehab facilities will take patients to SMART Recovery meetings instead of AA meetings if they request it.", "I understand that going no contact is not an option for you. Do you have access to your brother's lawyer? You need support, too. Not just your brother. \n\nTaking responsibility for him is a huge step. If you want to consider it, please talk to his lawyer and your brother to make sure your boundaries are clear.", "If you think your brother or his friends would hurt you in any way, no matter what decisions you make, please protect yourself.", "Absolutely NTA.

You need to look after you first.  Then you need to look after your nephew.", "NTA. I have suffered from addiction and I even have currently enrolled myself into housing where it's a sober living lifestyle to hope to keep on top of sobriety. So far it's working great and I would have loved to have a responsible and caring sister growing up. I mean you obviously do have the best interests at heart and he is VERY beyond fortunate not to have lost his son to a state organization but his son is with a good immediate family member.  Geez, he shouldn't ask you for too much else because of this.", "Nta he will tell you whatever you need to hear to get his way. He does not want to get clean he wants to not detox in jail", "NTA. I would make the same choice in your shoes. Your nephew needs to come first and your brother has repeatedly proven himself untrustworthy. Easy call.", "NTA. He can stay clean while in jail.
