I can only imagine this in the context of my brother, so I'm not going to be so arrogant as to say that my thoughts and opinions apply to you.\n\nThere is one thing that you might want to consider. When he finally does get serious about getting sober, will he need your moral support?

If you're in the US and your brother is non-religious and doesn't like AA, look up SMART Recovery.

All you have to do is look at Europe's success rates vs. the US. Science has shown REPEATEDLY that medication assisted therapy is the gold standard for drug addiction, but most TSPs actively discourage it and treat you like a failure if you use it. Researchers have also found that the \"powerless to control your addiction\" ideology (and it IS an ideology; TSPs are dogmatic) is very harmful. It actively undermines addicts' ability to take responsibility and feel psychologically whole in recovery. The majority of alcoholics in the US who succeed at recovery do so WITHOUT ANY program, and most of those go on to have a healthy relationship with alcohol. Unlike what AA says about them not being able to control how much they drink, those recovered alcoholics are able to drink in moderation, which shows you how far off base TSPs are. Many opioid addicts in Europe are able to have opioids for surgery and other significant medical pain safely because they learn to have a healthy relationship with substances. And the whole nonsense of \"if you're a drug addict you can't drink because you might forget not to do drugs\" or \"if you're an alcoholic you can't have opioids in medical situations because it'll end your sobriety\" is detrimental and false.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Grey's Anatomy and Station 19, but Shondaland drives me INSANE with their devotion to the Cult of the Twelve-Step Program. The worst one is a guy on Station 19 who has Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) from an injury, and he ONLY uses opioids when he's in pain. After his doctor cuts him off from opioids\u2014without any weaning or alternatives like Neurontin or Lyrica, tens unit, lidocaine options, pain reprocessing therapy (which is ideal for CRPS), cognitive behavioral therapy, osteopathic manipulative treatment, and on and on\u2014he steals injectable opioids from an ambulance at work, which BAD of course, but he ONLY USES IT WHEN HE'S IN PAIN. But because he stole and he requires Narcan after taking too much when he's in EXTREME pain, everyone says he's an addict and he goes to NA. But if you're only using pain meds when you're actively in pain, rather than seeking a high, you're not an addict. No, it's not sustainable to rely on opioids alone for chronic pain treatment, but the whole thing was the doctor's fault for not actually treating his pain or referring him to a pain specialist. And the thing is? CRPS is one of the most treatable kinds of chronic pain IF it's caught and treated early. That's definitely Shondaland's worst representation of \"addiction\" and TSPs, but their shows are completely contrary to addiction medicine science with the real addicts who had been using recreationally as well. And their shows are doing American society a huge disservice by perpetuating TSP myths. \n\nRecovering from addiction is not a matter of pure willpower. It's a delicate balance of medicine, cognitive strategies, and psychological healing. TSPs actively undermine all three facets. So it absolutely does matter what kind of rehab someone goes to, and it's a complete waste of taxpayer money for court diversion programs and Medicaid to send addicts to rehabs that use TSPs.", "NTA. My daughter had a bad drug problem for 6 years. She had several stints in rehab, all to no avail. I had thrown her out which resulted in her living in her car for almost a year. Finally, she got arrested. She called me to bail her (under $100) and I refused. I then contacted all family members and instructed that they, too, refuse. I talked to the arresting officer and asked him to beg the judge, on my behalf, to lodge her for as long as possible as she had a serious addiction and I was terrified she would end up dead. She stayed in jail for a month. In that time she lost her car and 100% hit rock bottom. Her bf (at the time) ended up ODing. She was so mad at me for leaving her there but had no choice but to call me upon her release. I truly believe that her stint in jail was what got her. I let her come home, got her a job, and bought her an old car to go to work & back. It helped that my husband & I were financially able to do this. We are not rich but had good jobs and lived frugally. She still works at that company and has been promoted to a very good position. She has been clean for 8 years and just recently bought her own house. Every addict has a different rock bottom. Jail was hers. Also, that 30 days was the first time I had a good night's sleep in 6 years because I was relatively certain she would not die. Detox on the floor of county jail was a bitch compared to the cushy rehabs she had been to in the past. It was a huge gamble-she could have met some people who taught her a whole new bag of tricks. It could have driven her even further away from me. Fortunately, in our case it worked. I wish you luck. Dealing with an addict is truly hell on earth. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.", "NTA. I also have custody of two of my sister's kids. I decided when I took custody (to prevent them ending up in foster care) it was the last thing I'll do to help her. Getting her shit together is on her, especially so if helping her would endanger my custody of the kids. And unless you also plan to have a social worker move in letting your brother move in definitely would.", "NTA good for you. It's always hard to say no to a loved one, even when YOU know it's the right thing to do. Best of luck to you and your family.", "nta", "NTA.  You are right to protect yourself and your nephew from your brother's substance abuse issues.  I wish you all the best.", "Nta", "NTA. He belongs in jail. Right move not putting your name on the line for someone who can't be trusted", "NTA\n\nDo not give in! He's looking for a place that doesn't have the ability to monitor him. It's obvious that he's not really ready to quit using, and being based in your house just means he will be bringing his addiction into the house.", "Nta\n\nYou already are helping him, you're raising the child he created, there's nothing else he should ever ask you for, because you took on his biggest responsibility. \n\nLike addicts do, he's probably burned every bridge and driven away every person that would be willing to take responsibility, only for him to go right back to using. He made his bed, he can lay in it.", "Addiction is a mental illness, not a disease. Sounds like he himself still doesnt want to get clean, just wants to use more.", "NTA. He\u2019s an addict he will say anything", "NTA what you have done is set a boundary and stuck to it. By maintaining those boundaries,  you are no longer enabling him, and maintaining your own personal safety.", "Your brother is a drug user and addict. Addicts are liars.\n\nHe\u2019s using the \u201cdisease\u201d excuse to hurt people.", "NTA", "NTA but do inform the social worker about his demand.

And it's not a \"disease\".", "I had to cut off my sibling due to their drug habits and how they were treating me during our mother's estate being carried out. Thankfully, OP could record calls and get more charges tacked on if they're so inclined.\n\nOP, you didn't screw up your brother's life; that's on him. Cut him off, warn your work what is going on in case someone tries to file complaints against you (personal experience), get pepper spray, and maybe move if possible.", "Even if OP is holding their addiction against them, why should she have to prioritize his needs over her own or her nephew's? Her brother is using his condition against her and saying she doesn't care and blah blah blah.", "I highly suggest an alarm. My friend lives in a sketchy area. She pays $64 a month for Adt. She can monitor home from her phone and will even be notified if someone blanks a glass window.  Once she told her rental insurance her rate went down and she used to refund to fund the Adt so monthly costs didn\u2019t really strain her budget", "You also need to worry about his drug addicted friends being nearby if you DO help him.", "And dead bolts and window locks if you have a sliding door get a thick dowl or rod that will fit in the grooves where the door slides"]}
