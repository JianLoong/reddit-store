{"id": 11108, "submission_id": "11e01qq", "title": "AITA for not giving my sister her wedding dress because she didn't invited my underage son?", "selftext": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. \n\nAt first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. \n\nThe problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no. \n\nThere are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made. \n\nShe called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day. \n\nI don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind.

He put so much time, emotion and work into making this dress, and your sister treated him cruelly. I'm also going to guess that your sister wanted to cheap out by getting a free dress, or least only paying for the costs of the materials.\n\nI get it when people who don't want little kids at their wedding, for various reasons. But saying \"no minors at all\" because there is alcohol being served is just bizarre. What, she's afraid that the minors will drink? That the adults will get too drunk and be poor role models? I don't understand.", "NTA. Very deceitful of her to accept the dress and not let him know until last minute he can't go. Being around alcohol doesn't mean he will drink anyway. And it's not illegal if you have parents permission.", "If minors are not invited due to alcohol, then it's not appropriate to wear a dress made by a minor....", "Absolutely NTA. Wedding gifts are always, always, ALWAYS based on the assumption that the person gifting is invited to the wedding. Nobody gives a gift for a wedding they aren't invited to, and more importantly, nobody in their right mind would ask for a gift from someone who they weren't planning to invite. OP's sister is awful and purposely took  advantage of a talented 17-year-old family member. If she doesn't have a wedding dress on her own wedding day, that's the natural consequences of her own assholery.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is\u2014big time. How awful to have your son create and sew a wedding gown only to be told he\u2019s not welcome at the wedding. What a slap in the face! \n\nDid your son get paid to design and make the gown? If so, I could see your sister having a right to it. (But I would give her the money back and tell her to shove it given the invite snub) If not, your son should look to sell it to someone who will appreciate the time spent making a wedding gown.", "NTA\n\nWhat an asshole move of her not inviting the person who is making her dress, for free.\n\nAsk her to pay for the dress or invite him, her decision.", "NTA - HOLY COW your sister is being such an unreasonable jerk to your son. Anyone who takes her side in this after you son put SO MUCH of his blood, sweat, and tears into making her dress for her only to get snubbed is just out of line. SO messed up.", " So NTA. Kudos to you mama  He's 17 not 3. That's just pure bitchiness. Tell your sister to push the wedding back till he's 18 and considered an adult. There's something fishy going on besides your sister taking advantage", "Wow, your sister is incredibly manipulative and self centred. Sounds like her plan all along was to just use your son for his talents just to save herself a lot of $$.  As a person who sews, I am sure your son put a HUGE amount of hard work and love into that wedding dress, leaving aside the cost of materials and labor. Time to go NC with sis, and get some photos of the dress - your son may be able to use it as part of his design portfolio for whatever he wants to study after high school, or to land a well paid job... and I reckon you'd be able to sell the dress for a good price too.", "NTA.

How unfair of your sister to expect your son to put in hours of work across a long span of time (and in doing so, saving her money), and then not even extend an invitation as a sign of gratitude. Not to mention him being the ONLY member of the entire family being left out?! That has to feel horrible. \n\nIt\u2019s also a little insulting that she seems to think your son either can\u2019t be around alcohol ever, and/or will try to drink underage. You\u2019re his parent, and she should leave it to you to decide if you\u2019re uncomfortable with the alcohol component of her wedding in regards to your son.", "Info: Was it known well in advance that there would be no minors?

She will get it, once she pays for the hours of work your son put into it. Even at minimum wage it will be a proper sum. Your wedding gift is the fabric, but all the work your son did has to he payed by her in full, that includes machine hours, etc.\nWitholding a dress sucks, her not inviting him sucks even more. So, she is going to get the dress, once she pays him for his work, otherwise it would have been her wedding present from him, so that is just fair.", "Nta us sens her a $10,000 bill. That's the lowest a hand stitched gown goes for", "NTA, \nOk so firstly your a mother above all and your doing right by your son, \nSecondly, whi asks a family member to make them a wedding dress then doesn't even want that said family member to be at the wedding? Not even to watch them walk down the isle, have a quick feed then have them head off once the drinking begins?\n\nI can understand not wanting children around what may be a lot of drinking but surly an exception can be made in this scenario? Your sister sounds up tight and selfish for this imo", "NTA. You son put his heart and soul into this dress. Sure he's seen her in it during fittings, but that's not the same as seeing her wearing it at the actual wedding. Plus, why is she so concerned that there will be alcohol there. He will be with you, so you can \"supervise\" him and can even offer to make sure he comes and leaves in the same vehicle as you if she is so concerned that he will drink. \n\nI get that people want \"child-free\" weddings, but to use alcohol as the reason seems slightly ridiculous. Children are exposed to alcohol all the time and yet manage to not drink and become alcoholics. Unless she is concerned that it's going to turn into some \"free for all\" due to all the guests drinking and getting totally wasted, which says a lot more about her friends than it does about your son. If it gets out of control, you will be there to take your son and leave.", "I feel like it's up to your son, what does he think?

This is just nasty.  \n\nYour son sounds awesome and I\u2019m sure he could get someone to model the dress to get some pics", "NTA/ESH. Now your sister knows damn well she\u2019s foul for asking someone to make her a dress without telling said someone they won\u2019t be invited. \n\nThat being said, in the comments you rejected the perfectly reasonable idea of charging her for the dress. Your son is being treated like a dressmaker and not a nephew who did her a favor, charge her accordingly and let him be properly compensated for his efforts.", "Totally NTA. At this point, even if your sister backtracks and sends an invitation, I still would be tempted to boycott the wedding. She is mean and exploitative.", "NTA. What\u2019s unreasonable was the fact she had him spend months making her a dress just for her to basically say \u201cfuck you\u201d right to his face", "NTA\n\nI was at a wedding a few weeks ago, open bar, kids allowed.  Everyone had a blast.\n\nAs there are  no other kids this rule is aimed directly at your son, its a power trip,", "Very much NTA.  Your sister leaves me speechless. Your son is family, not a wedding-dress Uber delivery service.", "NTA - she can pay full price for the dress, materials plus labor. Or get another dress somewhere else.", "NTA\n\nIf she is not paying for the dress, I would consider it a wedding gift. \n\nNo one is obligated to give a wedding present, especially someone not invited to the wedding.", "NTA good on you for sticking up for your son.", "Nta. Your sister is a piece of work asking your son to make a wedding dress and not invite him.", "Anyone else feel she might get jealous when she tells everyone the nephew made the dress and it divides the attention? NTA but BTA and either make her pay for the dress before releasing it.", "so she didn't pay for the dress (which damn the amount that would have cost), but wants to exclude the maker.\n\nmy guess is she doesn't want anyone to comment on the dress and it possibly shine attention to your child\n\nNTA", "What a mess.\n\nI think it's too much to completely deny her the wedding dress but here's what I would do:\n\n1. Give her a final warning that her being this unreasonable is going to permanently damage the relationship if she doesn't reconsider and\n\n2. If she doesn't reconsider, invoice her for the dress materials and your son's time. No sense in giving a grand wedding gift if your son isn't even invited.\n\nETA: ESH. Making a bride find a wedding dress 1 week before the wedding is kind of impossible and too harsh.", "I understand why you're doing it. I'd be pretty damn angry over this nonsense too. However, there's a compromise to be had. There's zero reason he can't attempt the wedding and skip the reception. If she can't agree to that then I agree, no dress. He didn't put all the time and effort into this creation only to be given the middle finger. Your sister did this to herself.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nOMG he MADE THE DRESS and wasn't invited!?!? And so close to 18 too ! Your sister is TA.\n\nAlso charge her for the dress, and make sure to account for time spent designing, too.", "NTA. She is welcome to purchase the dress off you. A cursory glance tells me that custom wedding dresses designed over MONTHS go for $10-20K", "NTA but boy is your sister a piece of work. Your son, at 17,  is old enough to design and create a wedding dress (no doubt at a fraction of the price of a bridal boutique) but too young to behave responsibly at a wedding?

Now, not only is your son not invited to her wedding, he (A) won't even get to see photos of her in the dress he painstakingly created and (B) will likely not be invited to any events in the future since you've essentially kicked off World War III over this one.", "NTA Your son jumped through hoops trying to please your sister and in the end he wasn't even invited to her wedding? What an entitled spoiled brat she's being. Do  not give the dress over unless she's willing to apologize and make an acception for your son.", "NTA. I am sure your son wasn\u2019t paid either. Tell your sister to go pound sand", "NTA and I\u2019m getting \u2018baby of the family\u2019 vibes here. Im curious if this is the first time she has acted so entitled and difficult about something. Because this is absolute bridezilla territory. \n\nShe knowingly withheld letting you know about the no minors rule while your son was making the dress which is exploitation. She planned this and just expects you to be ok with it because the wedding is so close and she can try to pressure you to just give her the dress given that. She\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll just give in and agree.\n\nBut you shouldn\u2019t, and you can\u2019t.\n\nThe ultimatum here is simple: either your son attends the wedding as a guest and gets to enjoy the day, knowing he is responsible and won\u2019t be drinking and for having made the dress as his wedding present to her OR you write up a full and accurate bill for a coutour custom dress and payment in full is expected before delivery or no dress will be provided and she can get married in her pajamas for all you care. \n\nI read something once and I live by it: \u201ca gift given in love is a gift to be cherished and treasured. But one scorned and abused is a gift undeserved.\u201d\n\nYour son made a gift out of a labor of love for her. He put his time, creativity, and a bit of his soul into the dress. For her, as a present. She is proving she is undeserving of that gift.\n\nYour family doesn\u2019t matter here. All of the other opinions are worthless. YOU do the right thing.

That being said, here is my exception. Your sister is incredibly rude and ungrateful, as you said, hes 17, but on top of it HE MADE THE DRESS BECAUSE SHE ASKED HIM TO. Like really? I wouldn't cave on this honestly, its too late, the only reason shes gonna invite your son at this point is because she wants the dress. Its really your son's call, not yours, but I would make her go find a dress last minute off the rack. Thats what she deserves. You didn't \"spoil her day\", she did.

How tf does she think that's okay?", "Nike pays its child workers more...", "The teenagers might even be the most well behaved people at the wedding. \n\nMy brothers were 14 and 16 at my cousins wedding, they ate cake, sat on their phones, refused to dance, and hung out with their grandma.", "Maybe even r/prettyrevenge", "dont forget arsehole tax", "Same here. I cannot imagine going through the hell of working with the kind of fabrics used in a wedding dress just to have the person be so ungrateful. I'd be pissed if someone acted like this over a simple cotton apron, let alone something so intricate.", "I think 10k is actually reasonable for a custom hand made dress. Maybe add a lil on top for bridezilla tax, 12k? Your son could buy a car with that!", "10k is probably less than what it would have cost her if her nephew hadn\u2019t been doing it as a personal favor, with OP paying for all of the materials. \n\n50 designs drawn up, the entire dress being handmade, expensive fabrics, 5 months of labor costs. \n\n10k for all of that would be a reasonable price for a non-wedding dress. Once you factor in the fact that people charge way more for anything that involves a wedding, 10k would be a steal.", "10k for a completely custom wedding gown made of nice fabric actually sounds about right I think?", "10k for months of designing, sewing and tailoring. 10k isn\u2019t even a big ask. Especially not with materials cost added. If it\u2019s for a wedding dress, it could be fancy fabrics and embellishments too.", "THIS NAILS IT. She realized that everyone is going to want to talk to her about her amazing nephew instead of her amazing self, and also that guests are going to realize that she shamelessly exploited him by not paying a cent for his incredibly difficult work.", "Yes - The usual thing is to make the cut off age around 13. \n\nI've only been to one that was adults only and that was an extremely small wedding (20 guests).\n\nI the 17yo dress designer isn't invited, the dress isn't a present an must be paid for.\n\nNTA", ">Getting older (18+) and going out with different friends at uni you could really see the differences in the approach to alcohol between those who hadn't had exposure from an earlier age and those that had.\n\nAbsolutely!\n\nWe in Germany allow light alcohol like beer from 16 and hard alcohol from 18. It was noticeable that those who had a problematic relationship with alcohol during university were those whose parents had forbidden them alcohol and only after they moved out had free access to alcohol, which was then often very excessive. Typical case of: Nothing tastes better than the forbidden fruit.\n\nI think it is the job of parents to teach their children a healthy way of dealing with topics with which the child inevitably comes into contact, such as alcohol, but also, for example, sex, money and fast food (I know a few who have a very disturbed relationship with fast food as a result of their upbringing). Making a taboo subject out of it is the worst possible way for a healthy relationship with such topics.", "This (sane) approach worked really well for me and my sisters. I'm youngest at 54 - none of us are in trouble with drink", "Where I live there\u2019s 17 year olds sneaked in at the pub all the time. The distinction between being 18 years old and being able to get blind drunk and 17 years old and not being out of touch a drop unless you\u2019re with your family is pretty arbitrary", "It's certainly is kind of a BS excuse this case, but if you're around in some wedding subs, you realize that this is actually considered  in many areas of the U.S. a bad influence to drink in front of minors. \n\nAt a distant cousin's wedding there was an American from the southern states and she allegedly made some comments (not in my presence, I only heard it from others): That she is amazed that alcohol is openly drunk at a Christian wedding.   \nThat's funny for me, because the wedding was in Bavaria, the stronghold of the Christian faith in Germany and Bavarians can sometimes drink beer for breakfast and call it a cultural good (Wei\u00dfwurstfr\u00fchst\u00fcck). To say that makes you a bad Christian did not go down so well with some proud Christian Bavarians.", "Someone above suggested the boy who made it should wear it \ud83d\ude01", "Exclusive design, multiple changes, custom fitting? Try $15k as a starting point", "Factor in how much she hurt him. Id put a 10k price tag on it. Take it or leave it and find another dress in a week.", "I would suggest, at the minimum, calculating the cost of materials plus hrs son did against wage per hrs. That should give a nice ballpark figure. The design stage, consulting, fitting, etc.\n\nStart a screenshot of all messages and save save save.", "This if she wants to pay for it minimum it will be $2000 or euros whatever and that\u2019s still really cheap for a custom dress with over 50 iterations of design. She still paying him list an hour he would spend on an ice cream at the shops.", "Yup what could the sister do at that point the child was already there \n\nThank god OP could cause a scene for her", "Yes, that's kind of the point. Don't expect free labor and materials and be TA", "She\u2019ll be calling you screaming soon when she realizes how much last minute dresses and alterations cost; be ready with a (high) price.", "Yah. It\u2019s ridiculous and I wasn\u2019t being sarcastic when I said beloved. My aunt and uncle are cool. And I would have been heartbroken if they didn\u2019t invite me (a teen but also mellow yellow) because of alcohol", "If I was the son i would rather give it to charity then give it to her for less than 12000+ dollars, so the bill cover the exploitation attempt of minor labor, the exploitation attempt of family and his hurt feelings of being the only one in the family excluded for the wedding after putting so much work for her. He could sell it to a shop if in need of money. You don't sell your dignity low.", "I'm gonna assume you're talking in dollars but depending where you go a bespoke dress can be cheaper than retail for a similar garment, for example I have just been quoted \u00a3900 for mine which is at the lower end for a full on wedding dress, admittedly I am assuming this due to the seamstress paying herself a criminal wage, I'm planning on \"tipping\" very well", "$10k's probably low end since she picked from 50 custom for-her-only designs in the beginning.", "The people who got ridiculous at my open bar wedding weren\u2019t the underage ones. It was the parents. And one rogue cousin that we don\u2019t talk to anymore. And I\u2019m American. It\u2019s not about the bar, it\u2019s about being cheap and cutting people out.", "Honestly? I\u2019d over price the dress. Similar dresses are only worth $1000? This one\u2019s worth $5000 since it was custom made", "Does your son want to go to fashion school or whatever they call it? Or college/university for something else? Because selling it to your sister for market value (probably around $10k) would make a nice head start into any student debt, and he could keep all his portfolio/design work (make sure he photographs the hell out of everything, and keeps any photos and videos of him making it) and use that as a presentation/resume.", "Sister will use the request for money to paint you and your son as greedy to the rest of the family. It'll allow her to get away with the social repercussions of treating your son poorly after he did such a generous thing for her. \n\nShe's also not going to pay anywhere near the true value of the dress (at least 5kUSD) so don't play this game. It will only devalue your son's work and make you loose the high ground.\n\nNTA by the way. Your sister was very greedy and self centered here and is ruining her own wedding.", "Nothing below 5 thousand + cost of material. If he wo\n\nOtherwise he should keep it and use it to gain more business to show what he can do.", "Honestly I would charge her at least $10,000 based on the amount of work."]}
