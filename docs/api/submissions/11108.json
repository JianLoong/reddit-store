{"id": 11108, "submission_id": "11e01qq", "title": "AITA for not giving my sister her wedding dress because she didn't invited my underage son?", "selftext": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. \n\nAt first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. \n\nThe problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no. \n\nThere are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made. \n\nShe called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day. \n\nI don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind.

He put so much time, emotion and work into making this dress, and your sister treated him cruelly. I'm also going to guess that your sister wanted to cheap out by getting a free dress, or least only paying for the costs of the materials.\n\nI get it when people who don't want little kids at their wedding, for various reasons. But saying \"no minors at all\" because there is alcohol being served is just bizarre. What, she's afraid that the minors will drink? That the adults will get too drunk and be poor role models? I don't understand.", "NTA. Very deceitful of her to accept the dress and not let him know until last minute he can't go. Being around alcohol doesn't mean he will drink anyway. And it's not illegal if you have parents permission.", "If minors are not invited due to alcohol, then it's not appropriate to wear a dress made by a minor....", "Absolutely NTA. Wedding gifts are always, always, ALWAYS based on the assumption that the person gifting is invited to the wedding. Nobody gives a gift for a wedding they aren't invited to, and more importantly, nobody in their right mind would ask for a gift from someone who they weren't planning to invite. OP's sister is awful and purposely took  advantage of a talented 17-year-old family member.

If so, I could see your sister having a right to it.

Kudos to you mama  He's 17 not 3. That's just pure bitchiness. Tell your sister to push the wedding back till he's 18 and considered an adult. There's something fishy going on besides your sister taking advantage", "Wow, your sister is incredibly manipulative and self centred. Sounds like her plan all along was to just use your son for his talents just to save herself a lot of $$.  As a person who sews, I am sure your son put a HUGE amount of hard work and love into that wedding dress, leaving aside the cost of materials and labor. Time to go NC with sis, and get some photos of the dress - your son may be able to use it as part of his design portfolio for whatever he wants to study after high school, or to land a well paid job... and I reckon you'd be able to sell the dress for a good price too.", "NTA. She spoiled her own big day.", "Info: Is your sister willing to pay your son for the dress and are you going to continue to withhold it if she does.", "YTA Because you took this decision away from your son. He worked hard on this dress and he should have been the one to decide if she gets it or not. \n\nTrust me as someone who sews- clients are fucking difficult, ESPECIALLY if they\u2019re family.

How unfair of your sister to expect your son to put in hours of work across a long span of time (and in doing so, saving her money), and then not even extend an invitation as a sign of gratitude. Not to mention him being the ONLY member of the entire family being left out?! That has to feel horrible. \n\nIt\u2019s also a little insulting that she seems to think your son either can\u2019t be around alcohol ever, and/or will try to drink underage.

Not even to watch them walk down the isle, have a quick feed then have them head off once the drinking begins?\n\nI can understand not wanting children around what may be a lot of drinking but surly an exception can be made in this scenario? Your sister sounds up tight and selfish for this imo", "NTA. You son put his heart and soul into this dress. Sure he's seen her in it during fittings, but that's not the same as seeing her wearing it at the actual wedding. Plus, why is she so concerned that there will be alcohol there. He will be with you, so you can \"supervise\" him and can even offer to make sure he comes and leaves in the same vehicle as you if she is so concerned that he will drink. \n\nI get that people want \"child-free\" weddings, but to use alcohol as the reason seems slightly ridiculous. Children are exposed to alcohol all the time and yet manage to not drink and become alcoholics. Unless she is concerned that it's going to turn into some \"free for all\" due to all the guests drinking and getting totally wasted, which says a lot more about her friends than it does about your son.

This is just nasty.  \n\nYour son sounds awesome and I\u2019m sure he could get someone to model the dress to get some pics", "NTA/ESH. Now your sister knows damn well she\u2019s foul for asking someone to make her a dress without telling said someone they won\u2019t be invited. \n\nThat being said, in the comments you rejected the perfectly reasonable idea of charging her for the dress. Your son is being treated like a dressmaker and not a nephew who did her a favor, charge her accordingly and let him be properly compensated for his efforts.", "Totally NTA. At this point, even if your sister backtracks and sends an invitation, I still would be tempted to boycott the wedding. She is mean and exploitative.", "NTA. What\u2019s unreasonable was the fact she had him spend months making her a dress just for her to basically say \u201cfuck you\u201d right to his face", "NTA\n\nI was at a wedding a few weeks ago, open bar, kids allowed.  Everyone had a blast.\n\nAs there are  no other kids this rule is aimed directly at your son, its a power trip,", "Very much NTA.  Your sister leaves me speechless.

Give her a final warning that her being this unreasonable is going to permanently damage the relationship if she doesn't reconsider and\n\n2. If she doesn't reconsider, invoice her for the dress materials and your son's time. No sense in giving a grand wedding gift if your son isn't even invited.\n\nETA: ESH. Making a bride find a wedding dress 1 week before the wedding is kind of impossible and too harsh.", "I understand why you're doing it. I'd be pretty damn angry over this nonsense too. However, there's a compromise to be had. There's zero reason he can't attempt the wedding and skip the reception. If she can't agree to that then I agree, no dress.

Now, not only is your son not invited to her wedding, he (A) won't even get to see photos of her in the dress he painstakingly created and (B) will likely not be invited to any events in the future since you've essentially kicked off World War III over this one.", "NTA Your son jumped through hoops trying to please your sister and in the end he wasn't even invited to her wedding? What an entitled spoiled brat she's being. Do  not give the dress over unless she's willing to apologize and make an acception for your son.", "NTA. I am sure your son wasn\u2019t paid either. Tell your sister to go pound sand", "NTA and I\u2019m getting \u2018baby of the family\u2019 vibes here. Im curious if this is the first time she has acted so entitled and difficult about something. Because this is absolute bridezilla territory. \n\nShe knowingly withheld letting you know about the no minors rule while your son was making the dress which is exploitation.

But one scorned and abused is a gift undeserved.\u201d\n\nYour son made a gift out of a labor of love for her. He put his time, creativity, and a bit of his soul into the dress.

Also, what the hell is wrong with brides these days? Is it some sort of temporary insanity leading to the wedding? I got married 7 months ago and it was my dream day, all I cared about was looking like a princess and wear my biggest smile because the day goes by so quickly and it\u2019s really about celebrating love. Parents took their kids, my three cousins (9F, 9M & 6F) were the ring bearers, I didn\u2019t care what others wore, if they had makeup or not, if the hair was professionally done or whatnot, the only request was, look decent (no gym clothes, no jeans lol) while being comfortable and have fun with us. We were such a relaxed couple that even the staff at the reception congratulated our parents for the people they raised, after everyone left, the same staff opened a bottle of Champagne (free) and toasted with us. Being nice goes a long way, believe me! Had your sister been a good person and she wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.
