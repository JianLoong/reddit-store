{"id": 11108, "submission_id": "11e01qq", "title": "AITA for not giving my sister her wedding dress because she didn't invited my underage son?", "selftext": "I (40m) have a sister (30f) who is getting married in a week. The groom proposed to her a year ago at a family dinner that left everyone speechless, but very happy for them as they are longtime companions. During this dinner, my sister asked my son (17m) to make her wedding dress. My son has always loved design and fashion, he took technical courses in these areas and sewing, and even his friends keep asking for his clothes because they are so beautiful. He agreed, but said that he needed time and that he would need her opinion constantly. \n\nAt first my sister was very annoying. My son drew about 50 dress designs in a month and she only liked one, which he continued with. He sewed it with great quality fabric which I paid for as I wanted to get involved in a certain way. For five months he made several adjustments to suit her wishes, as she always complained about something. After a while, he arrived at the final model and it was just amazing. My mother cried seeing my sister in the dress and I confess that I almost got emotional too. \n\nThe problem was that last week my son came to talk to me about the wedding invitation that had not arrived for him, but for other family members. I thought maybe he didn't need one, but it still felt weird. I messaged my sister raising this issue and she replied that she didn't want any underage people at her wedding because there would be alcohol. I asked if she was going to make an exception for my son, but she cut me off and said no. \n\nThere are no children in our family, my son is the only minor, so I didn't see any sense in this rule for family members. And to make matters worse, my son was very sad and cried because he spent months on this dress and couldn't go to the wedding. I was very upset and told my sister that she should look for another dress as soon as possible, as she would no longer wear the one my son made. \n\nShe called and yelled at me, saying I was being unreasonable and that I couldn't do this. My mother called me saying I should deliver the dress and follow the rules, but I didn't and hung up on her. Because of this, the family is divided. Many agree with me and condemn my sister's action saying she could only make an exception, but another part says I'm unreasonable and I'm spoiling her big day. \n\nI don't think I'm being wrong but just rational and paying her back in kind. So AITA?\n\n\nUPDATE: \n\nfirst I would like to thank all the comments and suggestions, I really didn't expect my post to resonate so much. \n\nI talked to my son about the suggestions you guys gave me and he agreed to sell the dress at market price. He calculated the price of everything and the value was quite high. We sent the proposal to my sister and she hated it. She said she couldn't afford it because it was too expensive and it should be a gift because \"she is family\". I responded by saying that it was too easy to say she was family to get a free dress, but not enough to include my son. She cried on the call and begged me not to ruin her day, but I didn't call because that to me was bullshit. \n\nAt no point did she offer to just let my son go or apologize for it. \n\nAnd for anyone who said that maybe she's homophobic, I'm not sure, but I think who could be influencing her is her fianc\u00e9 who is a Christian and has never been close to my son. However, I don't care if he's doing it or not. If she wants to exclude my son from this event then she will also be cutting ties with me. \n\nAnd for those who are asking for a photo of the dress, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but my son didn't agree and unfortunately I won't post it because of that. \n\nIf anything else happens I'll let you know, until then, thank you all!", "created_utc": 1677569581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11e01qq/aita_for_not_giving_my_sister_her_wedding_dress/", "score": 23065, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He put so much time, emotion and work into making this dress, and your sister treated him cruelly. I'm also going to guess that your sister wanted to cheap out by getting a free dress, or least only paying for the costs of the materials.\n\nI get it when people who don't want little kids at their wedding, for various reasons. But saying \"no minors at all\" because there is alcohol being served is just bizarre. What, she's afraid that the minors will drink? That the adults will get too drunk and be poor role models? I don't understand.", "NTA. Very deceitful of her to accept the dress and not let him know until last minute he can't go. Being around alcohol doesn't mean he will drink anyway. And it's not illegal if you have parents permission.", "If minors are not invited due to alcohol, then it's not appropriate to wear a dress made by a minor....", "Absolutely NTA. Wedding gifts are always, always, ALWAYS based on the assumption that the person gifting is invited to the wedding. Nobody gives a gift for a wedding they aren't invited to, and more importantly, nobody in their right mind would ask for a gift from someone who they weren't planning to invite. OP's sister is awful and purposely took  advantage of a talented 17-year-old family member. If she doesn't have a wedding dress on her own wedding day, that's the natural consequences of her own assholery.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is\u2014big time. How awful to have your son create and sew a wedding gown only to be told he\u2019s not welcome at the wedding. What a slap in the face! \n\nDid your son get paid to design and make the gown? If so, I could see your sister having a right to it. (But I would give her the money back and tell her to shove it given the invite snub) If not, your son should look to sell it to someone who will appreciate the time spent making a wedding gown.", "NTA\n\nWhat an asshole move of her not inviting the person who is making her dress, for free.\n\nAsk her to pay for the dress or invite him, her decision.", "NTA - HOLY COW your sister is being such an unreasonable jerk to your son. Anyone who takes her side in this after you son put SO MUCH of his blood, sweat, and tears into making her dress for her only to get snubbed is just out of line. SO messed up.", " So NTA. Kudos to you mama  He's 17 not 3. That's just pure bitchiness. Tell your sister to push the wedding back till he's 18 and considered an adult. There's something fishy going on besides your sister taking advantage", "Wow, your sister is incredibly manipulative and self centred. Sounds like her plan all along was to just use your son for his talents just to save herself a lot of $$.  As a person who sews, I am sure your son put a HUGE amount of hard work and love into that wedding dress, leaving aside the cost of materials and labor. Time to go NC with sis, and get some photos of the dress - your son may be able to use it as part of his design portfolio for whatever he wants to study after high school, or to land a well paid job... and I reckon you'd be able to sell the dress for a good price too.", "NTA.

How unfair of your sister to expect your son to put in hours of work across a long span of time (and in doing so, saving her money), and then not even extend an invitation as a sign of gratitude. Not to mention him being the ONLY member of the entire family being left out?! That has to feel horrible. \n\nIt\u2019s also a little insulting that she seems to think your son either can\u2019t be around alcohol ever, and/or will try to drink underage. You\u2019re his parent, and she should leave it to you to decide if you\u2019re uncomfortable with the alcohol component of her wedding in regards to your son.", "Info: Was it known well in advance that there would be no minors?

She will get it, once she pays for the hours of work your son put into it. Even at minimum wage it will be a proper sum. Your wedding gift is the fabric, but all the work your son did has to he payed by her in full, that includes machine hours, etc.\nWitholding a dress sucks, her not inviting him sucks even more. So, she is going to get the dress, once she pays him for his work, otherwise it would have been her wedding present from him, so that is just fair.", "Nta us sens her a $10,000 bill.

Not even to watch them walk down the isle, have a quick feed then have them head off once the drinking begins?\n\nI can understand not wanting children around what may be a lot of drinking but surly an exception can be made in this scenario? Your sister sounds up tight and selfish for this imo", "NTA. You son put his heart and soul into this dress. Sure he's seen her in it during fittings, but that's not the same as seeing her wearing it at the actual wedding. Plus, why is she so concerned that there will be alcohol there. He will be with you, so you can \"supervise\" him and can even offer to make sure he comes and leaves in the same vehicle as you if she is so concerned that he will drink. \n\nI get that people want \"child-free\" weddings, but to use alcohol as the reason seems slightly ridiculous. Children are exposed to alcohol all the time and yet manage to not drink and become alcoholics. Unless she is concerned that it's going to turn into some \"free for all\" due to all the guests drinking and getting totally wasted, which says a lot more about her friends than it does about your son. If it gets out of control, you will be there to take your son and leave.", "I feel like it's up to your son, what does he think?

This is just nasty.  \n\nYour son sounds awesome and I\u2019m sure he could get someone to model the dress to get some pics", "NTA/ESH. Now your sister knows damn well she\u2019s foul for asking someone to make her a dress without telling said someone they won\u2019t be invited. \n\nThat being said, in the comments you rejected the perfectly reasonable idea of charging her for the dress. Your son is being treated like a dressmaker and not a nephew who did her a favor, charge her accordingly and let him be properly compensated for his efforts.", "Totally NTA. At this point, even if your sister backtracks and sends an invitation, I still would be tempted to boycott the wedding. She is mean and exploitative.", "NTA. What\u2019s unreasonable was the fact she had him spend months making her a dress just for her to basically say \u201cfuck you\u201d right to his face", "NTA\n\nI was at a wedding a few weeks ago, open bar, kids allowed.  Everyone had a blast.\n\nAs there are  no other kids this rule is aimed directly at your son, its a power trip,", "Very much NTA.  Your sister leaves me speechless. Your son is family, not a wedding-dress Uber delivery service.", "NTA - she can pay full price for the dress, materials plus labor. Or get another dress somewhere else.", "NTA\n\nIf she is not paying for the dress, I would consider it a wedding gift. \n\nNo one is obligated to give a wedding present, especially someone not invited to the wedding.", "NTA good on you for sticking up for your son.", "Nta. Your sister is a piece of work asking your son to make a wedding dress and not invite him.", "Anyone else feel she might get jealous when she tells everyone the nephew made the dress and it divides the attention?

Give her a final warning that her being this unreasonable is going to permanently damage the relationship if she doesn't reconsider and\n\n2. If she doesn't reconsider, invoice her for the dress materials and your son's time. No sense in giving a grand wedding gift if your son isn't even invited.\n\nETA: ESH.

And so close to 18 too ! Your sister is TA.\n\nAlso charge her for the dress, and make sure to account for time spent designing, too.", "NTA. She is welcome to purchase the dress off you.

Now, not only is your son not invited to her wedding, he (A) won't even get to see photos of her in the dress he painstakingly created and (B) will likely not be invited to any events in the future since you've essentially kicked off World War III over this one.", "NTA Your son jumped through hoops trying to please your sister and in the end he wasn't even invited to her wedding? What an entitled spoiled brat she's being. Do  not give the dress over unless she's willing to apologize and make an acception for your son.", "NTA. I am sure your son wasn\u2019t paid either. Tell your sister to go pound sand", "NTA and I\u2019m getting \u2018baby of the family\u2019 vibes here. Im curious if this is the first time she has acted so entitled and difficult about something. Because this is absolute bridezilla territory. \n\nShe knowingly withheld letting you know about the no minors rule while your son was making the dress which is exploitation.

But one scorned and abused is a gift undeserved.\u201d\n\nYour son made a gift out of a labor of love for her. He put his time, creativity, and a bit of his soul into the dress. For her, as a present. She is proving she is undeserving of that gift.\n\nYour family doesn\u2019t matter here. All of the other opinions are worthless. YOU do the right thing.
