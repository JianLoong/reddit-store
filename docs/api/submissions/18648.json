People always call them private family matters when they know their behavior is indefensible.", "Definitely NTA. You can\u2019t attend a party you didn\u2019t know about! He\u2019s now mad because you called him out on his lies and proved to family that he hasn\u2019t actually celebrated anything for you in years. It makes him look bad obviously and that\u2019s what he\u2019s mad about. You do you! Good luck with your new job and your move!", "NTA  \nWhat a brilliant way of putting him in his place. You were honest with people. He publicly accused you of lying. You proved he was the one lying. He now thinks you're wrong for talking about private family matters. Funny how he was okay talking about then publicly until he got his ass handed to him.", "NTA. When you throw someone a surprise party you have to actually get them there somehow. Unless you had plans with your dad that you ditched without notice, he messed this one up big time.", "Who plans a party and doesn't invite the guest of honor?!\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\n>Now he is mad for talking about private family matters. \n\nNo, he's mad because people have found out the truth about him.\n\n>He told everyone I was lying\n\nWhat a great father.", "NTA usually one of the planners is responsible for making sure the person getting surprised shows up to the party. That's totally on them.", "NTA - So you didn't turn up for a party you weren't aware of? That's not on you or your father - its a mistake. The fact you didn't even expect it due to past behavior? Doubly not on you and your father should have tried to ensure you were there (maybe not planned a surprise for one). \n\nHowever your father then lying about the past and getting called on it. That's now him causing problems and reaping the consequences. Of course he's mad - people now know about his past behavior. \n\nHere's the thing; a bigger person would have never lied about the past but, instead, apologized for missing past celebrations and saying they understand why you didn't expect something this time. Then, if they were extra sorry, would have rescheduled with you. Instead he is acting like you were mean to him.", "Definitely NTA!! \nHe's just pissed that the image of the \"perfect blended family\" he's been portraying to family and friends came crashing down with a swiftness. I am so sorry your relatives have consistently blown you off for the past decade, and so incredibly proud of you and happy for you that you've built an incredible, loving family of friends!!", "NTA! Congratulations on your graduation. It seems as though the party your father organised was more to show off than to actually celebrate your accomplishments. I\u2019m glad you got to celebrate in your own way. Your father has no right to be upset with you. He needs to be upset with himself.", "NTA you were asked, and told the truth. He's only upset because he caused himself to be exposed. This is entirely a problem hw created, and not on you at all.", "NTA - Congratulations on the degree!  Your father is only upset because he got called to the carpet and had nothing to fight back with. Enjoy your new chapter in a new city.", "NTA at all, you had no reason whatsoever to expect this to be the first time in a decade he'd throw a party for you, he doesn't get to act put out.

Don't blame you.", "NTA and your dad can go kick rocks.", "NTA congratulations on your graduation and new job\n\nIt\u2019s horrible just another parent that forgets their first children when the move on with life, He\u2019s the one that tried to little to late.

Another disappointing set of parents who will never hear from their kid again. \n\nGo out and live your life, parents are overrated. Especially parents who can\u2019t seem to find the bandwidth for more than 1 kid.\n\nThe family you choose and build with your heart is what is most important.", "NTA. If he is anything like my parents, the party wasn't for you. It was for him.  How great he is that you are successful. \n\nYou denied him that. He now looks less in the eyes of his friends and family and is pissed at you.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you didn't KNOW about the party. How are you supposed to be at a party celebrating you if you weren't told about the date, time and location? And if they told you but you already had plans, well that is on them too. \n\nSecond, your Dad is only mad because his own actions (or inaction) embarrassed him. He did that to himself by not paying attention to your milestones and then planning a party without paying attention to needing YOU to be there. \n\nFinally, absolutely go get your stuff and move on. I'm sorry that your Dad hasn't been there for you, but sounds like you are making a great life for yourself.  I don't know you but I am proud of you, and congratulations! Keep moving forward and don't let him or anyone else push you backwards.", "NTA - he threw the party for him.", "NTA. I can see some are baffled as to why he was expecting you to just show up. But, from what you describe, I'm not sure if your dad was even thinking of you in this at all. \n\nObviously, you had no reason to expect him to make any effort. No when it's been about a decade since he tried.\n\nBut, even without that history, if dad had been thinking of you, the real you, at all, he'd have made an effort to ensure you were there. Not just expect you to show up, or however he thought it would work.\n\nBut whatever he was thinking, it wasn't you in his plans. It was a standee of you in his mind that fit in with his plans. Something that would trot out at the right time, make the needed appearance, and then go back into storage.\n\nHis attempt to call you a liar also shows he wasn't thinking about you and the past history. If he had, he'd have known that he was in no position to be called out.\n\nIn all likelihood, the only thing he's been thinking of in this has probably been looking good to friends and relatives. Your graduation was probably just a means to an end. That it blew up in his face is truly his problem, not yours.\n\nAs for getting your stuff and moving away without dealing with this anymore, it is a good plan for the short term. But, be prepared to potentially deal with it at least one more time in the long term.\n\nIf you get into a relationship and get married, that is a point where you can expect at least an attempt to force his way back into your life. Not because of any desire to have a relationship with you, but to look good to others, and convince them he's changed.\n\nBut even then, you would still be NTA for shutting him down.", "Surprise parties don't work", "NTA.  You told the truth. I\u2019m glad you had your friend and her mom as a support system. Best of luck in your new city.", "How were you supposed to go to a party you weren\u2019t aware of?

Shake the dust from your shoes when you leave that house and never look back.", "INFO- were you invited and aware it was a party?", "INFO: How was the surprise party supposed to go down? Usually you tell the guest of honor that you want to hang out or something, then surprise them with a party. Did he invite you over to meet him and you agreed but just never showed? If this is the case, then I would say YTA. \n\nActually, tbh, even if that isn't the case, then I kinda still think YTA. You said you got \"birthday presents and such\" - I feel like that IS celebrating. Sure, parties are nice, but there are different ways to celebrate. He planned a big party for you, and you didn't show. Either he invited you and you ditched him or maybe you were out of town and couldn't be there.
