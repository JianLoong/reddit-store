That's now him causing problems and reaping the consequences. Of course he's mad - people now know about his past behavior. \n\nHere's the thing; a bigger person would have never lied about the past but, instead, apologized for missing past celebrations and saying they understand why you didn't expect something this time.

How are you supposed to be at a party celebrating you if you weren't told about the date, time and location? And if they told you but you already had plans, well that is on them too. \n\nSecond, your Dad is only mad because his own actions (or inaction) embarrassed him.

I'm sorry that your Dad hasn't been there for you, but sounds like you are making a great life for yourself.  I don't know you but I am proud of you, and congratulations!

But, from what you describe, I'm not sure if your dad was even thinking of you in this at all. \n\nObviously, you had no reason to expect him to make any effort. No when it's been about a decade since he tried.\n\nBut, even without that history, if dad had been thinking of you, the real you, at all, he'd have made an effort to ensure you were there. Not just expect you to show up, or however he thought it would work.\n\nBut whatever he was thinking, it wasn't you in his plans. It was a standee of you in his mind that fit in with his plans. Something that would trot out at the right time, make the needed appearance, and then go back into storage.\n\nHis attempt to call you a liar also shows he wasn't thinking about you and the past history. If he had, he'd have known that he was in no position to be called out.\n\nIn all likelihood, the only thing he's been thinking of in this has probably been looking good to friends and relatives. Your graduation was probably just a means to an end. That it blew up in his face is truly his problem, not yours.\n\nAs for getting your stuff and moving away without dealing with this anymore, it is a good plan for the short term. But, be prepared to potentially deal with it at least one more time in the long term.\n\nIf you get into a relationship and get married, that is a point where you can expect at least an attempt to force his way back into your life. Not because of any desire to have a relationship with you, but to look good to others, and convince them he's changed.\n\nBut even then, you would still be NTA for shutting him down.", "Surprise parties don't work", "NTA.
