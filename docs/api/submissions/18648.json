Doubly not on you and your father should have tried to ensure you were there (maybe not planned a surprise for one). \n\nHowever your father then lying about the past and getting called on it. That's now him causing problems and reaping the consequences. Of course he's mad - people now know about his past behavior. \n\nHere's the thing; a bigger person would have never lied about the past but, instead, apologized for missing past celebrations and saying they understand why you didn't expect something this time.

He now looks less in the eyes of his friends and family and is pissed at you.", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you didn't KNOW about the party. How are you supposed to be at a party celebrating you if you weren't told about the date, time and location? And if they told you but you already had plans, well that is on them too. \n\nSecond, your Dad is only mad because his own actions (or inaction) embarrassed him. He did that to himself by not paying attention to your milestones and then planning a party without paying attention to needing YOU to be there. \n\nFinally, absolutely go get your stuff and move on. I'm sorry that your Dad hasn't been there for you, but sounds like you are making a great life for yourself.  I don't know you but I am proud of you, and congratulations! Keep moving forward and don't let him or anyone else push you backwards.", "NTA - he threw the party for him.", "NTA. I can see some are baffled as to why he was expecting you to just show up. But, from what you describe, I'm not sure if your dad was even thinking of you in this at all. \n\nObviously, you had no reason to expect him to make any effort. No when it's been about a decade since he tried.\n\nBut, even without that history, if dad had been thinking of you, the real you, at all, he'd have made an effort to ensure you were there. Not just expect you to show up, or however he thought it would work.\n\nBut whatever he was thinking, it wasn't you in his plans. It was a standee of you in his mind that fit in with his plans. Something that would trot out at the right time, make the needed appearance, and then go back into storage.\n\nHis attempt to call you a liar also shows he wasn't thinking about you and the past history. If he had, he'd have known that he was in no position to be called out.\n\nIn all likelihood, the only thing he's been thinking of in this has probably been looking good to friends and relatives. Your graduation was probably just a means to an end. That it blew up in his face is truly his problem, not yours.\n\nAs for getting your stuff and moving away without dealing with this anymore, it is a good plan for the short term. But, be prepared to potentially deal with it at least one more time in the long term.\n\nIf you get into a relationship and get married, that is a point where you can expect at least an attempt to force his way back into your life. Not because of any desire to have a relationship with you, but to look good to others, and convince them he's changed.\n\nBut even then, you would still be NTA for shutting him down.", "Surprise parties don't work", "NTA.

People around here like to be about righteousness and putting people in their place, but it's good to be empathic, as in trying to understand people.

Or maybe he thought you actually *preferred* going out with your friends? Or hell, maybe in a pubescent fit, you told him that birthday parties are for babies and then forgot about it? My point is, you don\u2019t know why he stopped throwing you parties because you didn\u2019t talk to him about it.
