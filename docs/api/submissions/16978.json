After a trip to see my father I was offered an apprenticeship from one of my fathers friend. I was offered to move in with my father and my step mother so I could take the apprenticeship. \n\nMy step mom and I have never gotten along. I don\u2019t know what her issues has been with me but she seems to take all her frustration out on me. It\u2019s either calling me out in a group chat for letting some dishes soak and going around calling me fat and lazy. To making me and me alone announce when I\u2019m home. I\u2019ve tried talking to her about treating me better but she blows up and cries to my father saying I\u2019m arguing. Then theirs my father who enables her and always tells me to try and keep the peace\n\nNow onto the reason I made the post, have been sick the past two days from what seems like the flu and have been using the downstairs bathroom instead of the shared bathroom that my step brother and I have access to. Well yesterday I went downstairs to clean the bathroom since I don\u2019t want anyone to get sick. The problem with this bathroom is that their three dogs use it as a water bowl since my father and step mother don\u2019t put one out for them making the toilet full of dog slobber and dirt. I already have to clean it most of the time  to use the bathroom. Yesterday I was talking to my father and started wiping the bathroom down the bathroom with Clorox wipes and paper towels while we talked. During the conversation we agreed I was to wipe it down now and then use bleach to clean the bathroom before bed. So I did like I was told and took bleach to every surface of that bathroom, toilet, sink, floor, door, everything.\n\nNext afternoon while at work I get a message that I need to bleach and wipe down the entire bathroom again because it hasn\u2019t been properly cleaned. So I messaged back that it was cleaned and the dogs probably drank out of it. This just set her off and started saying it wasn\u2019t cleaned yesterday or today and that she couldn\u2019t believe I was arguing over this. \n\nOnce I got home I could hear my step mom screaming to my father over the phone about me disrespecting her. I later got a call from my father asking why I had to argue and start issues followed by \u201cif you need me to teach you how to clean a toilet correctly I will but theirs no need to be an asshole.\u201d He saw me clean and wipe it down but won\u2019t back me up on it.\n\nI left the house after that but am worried that this wasn\u2019t the worth it to fight her on this so Reddit am I the asshole for standing my ground over a toilet", "created_utc": 1683817560, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eq18v/aita_for_having_a_toilet_be_my_hill_to_die_on/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make their lives a living hell.  Complain to them way, way more than your stepmom does.  Play the victim card, early and often, and demand that he do something about her disrespectful behavior. And, this is really important, make sure you are the first 1 to complain to him. \n\nEither that or move out.\n\nNTA", "So your dad *literally watched* you clean the bathroom, and now he won't back you up against his wife gaslighting you? You are sooo NTA. And your dad needs to grow a spine.\n\nYou've described what I guess is the tip of the iceberg - tons more stories of drama from this woman are probably lurking around the corner, and the longer you stay there the bigger that iceberg is going to get.\n\nSounds like she trying to find any reason to get rid of you. Rather than give her any more ammo to use against you, just find a way to walk out on your own terms.", "On its own, that wouldn't be worth it. However, you've described a long pattern of emotional abuse and manipulation, so if you can leave (financially), it's time to do so. She clearly resents you being there (not surprising, since you've never gotten along) and wants to force you out. If she doesn't manage it over this, get ready for next week's drama and so on. NTA", "NTA\n\nyour father's wife sounds like she has mental issues. either that or she has an unreasonable hatred for you. either way it's just not worth the effort. \n\nmaybe look for someplace else to live, if possible. your father is never going to have your back. so, you're going to need to move, or need to put up with crazy mcnutbar's controlling ways until you can.", "NTA. Yikes.. your step mom sounds horrible and your dad has no backbone. Tell your dad it's not up to you to keep the peace when your step mom is the one creating unnecessary drama.", "NTA, but you need to move out asap. This woman hates you and will continue to make your life miserable as long as you stay in that household. Your father is a bystander in this situation, so don't rely on him for backup.

Too much stress and drama", "NTA. I\u2019ll bet money that she doesn\u2019t like the reminder (you) that your dad ever loved/married anyone other than her. That\u2019s why she\u2019s ridiculous with you. \n\nIt is clear you cannot continue to live with your dad due to your stepmothers behavior. I think you either need to move back to your moms, or out on your own away from her and her nonsense.", "NTA. \n1.  Find another place to live as soon as possible. \n2.  Depending on how important this apprenticeship is to you, it may make sense to move back with your mother. \n3.  In the meantime, don\u2019t engage her beyond the absolute minimum. If she asks you a question, answer it. But nothing argumentative.  For example: if she asks you if you cleaned the bathroom, you can say yes. If she says, why did you do such a shitty job of cleaning the bathroom, don\u2019t respond.", "NTA\n\nYour step mom is being a certified problem.", "NTA but you said 19 years, sounds like you\u2019re old enough to move out and get away from all that mess", "NTA. When you said that she cries to your father that you\u2019re arguing, my narcissism alarm bells started ringing \n\nAnd poor dogs. She doesn\u2019t provide them with a water bowl? Clean, consistent access to water is a basic pet right.", "ESH. Stop letting your dogs drink out of a bacteria infested shit hole, PLEASE?!", "Step mom sounds like a royal problem. Tell your dad to give his balls a tug and confront her, or leave her.

Do what you want to do and let her sound off endlessly.", "I would start recording video not only of the bathroom after you've cleaned it, but of the verbal abuse and bullying of your dad's wife.

However, your situation does sound a bit like a Cinderalla-type scenario. The communication needs to be improved here.\n\nUtlimately, as an adult child, you are the mercy of your parents. If you can't navigate this situation it's most likely best to move out of there.", "NTA. Your stepmother is being one though", "NTA, but close to an ESH except for you.", "YTA to yourself for staying in that house. She is the evil step mom and your dad refuses to stand up for you, HIS child, and put her in her place. Find somewhere else to live in that area.

And guilt him for abandoning his child or picking his new family or something emotionally manipulative like that. There are heart strings to pull.", "NTA.

Buy the poor dogs a bowl ffs", "NTA, but if the internship is important to you, it might make your life easier to do the following:\n1) After cleaning something send a pic in a group chat to your dad and step mom, not in a rude way just say, hey finished cleaning the bathroom, everything look ok?\n2) Tell your dad that you would feel more comfortable if communication about chores comes from him, or if step mom is persistent at least say with him there or through group chat. Tell him in a way that you are just trying your best to make things work for the short term while you are in their house to make things better for everyone. \n3) on weekends and breaks from work, when possible go to your moms house to let everyone decompress. \n4) offer to go to counseling with your dad and step mom to see if the relationship can be improved. \n\nUltimately it should not be on you to be the grown up in the situation,  but maybe approaching it as an adult will diffuse the abuse. She is absolutely in the wrong to call you fat or lazy, and if your dad doesn\u2019t acknowledge that, it is on him. \n\nIf trying those things don\u2019t work, unfortunately I think you need to talk to you dad\u2019s friend about the situation and see if there are any options for you to continue the internship while working from home at your mom\u2019s house online. If not you will have to professionally tell him you cannot complete it and move back home to your mom\u2019s house. I\u2019m so sorry for your situation, I have a 19 year old that lives at home and we try to do everything we can to make his life easier, because dang, you kids have a lot of responsibilities and stress getting through school and internships!  I just don\u2019t think a summer internship is worth destroying your mental health by living with an abusive step parent. In the future I would also tell your dad that, while you would love to have a good relationship with him, you will no longer accept the abuse of his wife. Any visits in the future should be on neutral ground without her present, until such time they agree to counseling.", "If she calls you out in a group chat, the next time something happens call her out in the group chat along with your spineless father!!

I don\u2019t know why anyone would think that\u2019s an okay thing to do.", "Yeah, your father definitely is going to continue to let your stepmom do whatever she wants. I hope you find a better living situation before it escalates.", "Yeah, that's honestly animal abuse & if your county animal control people knew, it would be a big problem. Access to daily clean fresh water is crucial to any animal's survival. Can you either get a nice deep bowl for the dog, or reach out for advice from an outside source. And I'm concerned at your being in that environment first of all, for sure. The way they're treating, frankly, anything alive *except for themselves,* sucks."]}
