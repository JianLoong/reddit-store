Good fences make good neighbors", "NTA. You're making sure you have your yard fenced in by getting a survey to be sure where the property line is.", "The municipal code is written that a permit WILL be issued given everything is in regulations.  I was very thorough to make sure I followed all the rules and they accepted my application and fees so I'm confident we'll get the approval.  We needed all neighbors consent to put in a privacy fence, rather than a chainlink, and we know Don and Tanya won't consent so trees are going in next spring.  We heard Arbor Vitae would be good but didn't know of alternatives so thank you for the suggestion!", "Is that the expression?  When I said I'm putting in a fence Don replied, \"You know what they say, good fences make poor neighbors\". \n\nI'd never heard it before, I feel dumb now.", "Leylandii can easily get out of control and grow very tall. They also block a lot of light so if you decide on them then I suggest you keep a check on the height or your area may get dark as well depending on orientation.\n\nI'd suggest shrubs along the fence and then trees native to your area a little further in so that the leaves \\*eye roll\\* don't further upset your neighbours. It does need to be something you will be happy to look out at.", "Why do all the neighbors have to consent?

Def NTA. \nI have heard on the Arborvitae to plant them offset instead of a single row. One back, one forward kind of thing.  You still get screen, but more root area.", "God I hate people sometimes.", "NTA, tell don and Tanya to get a hobby", "NTA you need this fence. Know that it likely won\u2019t end there tho. They will continue to find ways to interfere with you and your fence.", "I did a survey. Gave all neighbors 2 years to dispute survey with their own since what they thought was the property line was incorrect. No one did a survey, but they still complained when the fence was installed.\n\nHighly recommend planting rhizomes of miscanthus giganteus along the chainlink fence. A fast growing, clumping, and tall grass. Cut half the clump each year, so you always have a screen.", "NTA. You did everything by the book, Enjoy your newfound privacy!", "NTA. Your fence is a reaction to their nastiness. If don't like it, it is their own fault.\n\nThey sound like very unhappy people.", "Nta good fences make good neighbor and keep bad neighbors out. If they complain tell them you built the fence because they complained so much.  It is all on them.", "Make it a tall privacy fence on their side...I kid of course, that'd look terrible. That said, absolutely don't hesitate with either a fence or shrubbery divide. It sounds like your next door neighbors need a reality check.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nJust jumping in to say that after you install your fence you may wish to consider installing native shrubs (that grow over 10feet) that will both protect your privacy and help the planet and all the beneficial wildlife and insects and pollinators.

We assumed it was just a kind gesture at the time but in hindsight he is seems to be the type that has ulterior motives.  Thanks for the suggestion on how to plant the trees.  We were thinking Arborvitae but I didn't think about the root area.  We have tons of space as our yard is deep but not wide so that's a great idea.

Not just because a fence prevents a neighbor from encroaching on your property. \n\nIt\u2019s about being able to mind your own business. You can\u2019t see what the neighbors are doing and can\u2019t get mad about it, and vice versa. It eliminates nosiness. Fences prevent fights between neighbors.", "Don was either wrong or lying.

Perfect solution for negative neighbors!", "Cool!", "I love the way you think.  We plan to plant a wall of trees inside the fence line.  The fence is still necessary to keep the dogs / children in but the tree line should provide the privacy we desire.", "Yeah, but the poem is mocking his neighbor who keeps saying it. \n \"Why do they make good neighbors? Isn\u2019t it\nWhere there are cows? But here there are no cows.\nBefore I built a wall I\u2019d ask to know\nWhat I was walling in or walling out,\nAnd to whom I was like to give offense.\"\n\nThe narrator clearly doesn't see the need for the wall, but his neighbor insists, and keeps using that phrase. It's an allegory about the borders and divisions we put up.", "I suspect he was lying, he lied about the property line after all.  When I told him about the fence he also claimed there were high voltage lines buried on the line and I \"cannot dig\".    \nI talked to my brother who works with utilities and he said, those lines are buried 6' down and they are armored so I would need to hit it with heavy machinery (e.g. hydraulic auger) to be in any danger.", "Much appreciated.  Our city webpage is excellent about providing good information.  I stumbled on their recommended tree list a while ago when I was looking for \"how close to the property line / easement can I plant trees\".\n\nThe only advice I heard first hand was Arbor Vitaes so it became my default but after hearing all the great advice in here, I'll take a good look at what the city recommends and see if there are better options.", "I suggest you put in bushes as thorny and prickly as Don and Tanya.  Or maybe some chainlink with ivy trained up it as a screen.", "Dig a narrow trench about 2 ft deep a couple feet back from the property line. Pour a retaining concrete wall then plant bamboo on the neighbors side. Then sit back and watch.", "We have a leylandii/cedar hedge at the back of our property, planted by our rear neighbours (it was here when we bought the house 20 years ago; the neighbours have changed since, the hedge is still here). It's grown completely through the chainlink fence that was put up at one point by who-knows-who, and is often abuzz with birds nesting in it. It's about 7-8 feet high now and nice and dense, since I started fertilizing it. I planted hostas in front of our side to give texture to the bottom foot or so. The only downside, compared to the privacy fences on the side yards, is that our cat sometimes climbs through and then we have to run around the block to get her back...", "I had to look up how bamboo grows.  This would be diabolical!", "Why I fucking hate being in the city bc of stupid bullshit like that. Small towns is the way to go. When my ex-wife and I did our privacy fence, all I had to do was get a permit. No other dumbass hoops to jump through."]}
