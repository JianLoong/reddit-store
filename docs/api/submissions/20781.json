Posting on mobile sorry for the formatting.\n\nSo to layout the situation, my(25M) father's(50M) wife, my step-mother bought a house and decided to let my roommates and I continue renting the two bedroom apartment they no longer needed. The agreement between us, three, was that we each choose a room(one roommate chose the living room as his), and we would split the rent three ways.\n\nI eventually got a girlfriend(22F) and she started sleeping over a couple of nights of the week, however she had her own place she wanted to continue leasing. This was discussed between my roommates and I, and we decided we wouldn't change how the rent was split because it was originally decided on space not occupants.\n\nThis did however lead to issues with my father saying I was taking advantage of my roommates by not charging my girlfriend rent, which had already been resolved between all of us. He wanted to charge per person staying here which I know is the norm but we were all okay with the arrangement in place.\n\nNow onto the actual issue at hand, my brother(20M) and his girlfriend(22F), Marc and Lisa who were borrowing my car to go to work, moved out of their previous living arrangements and into our living room.\n\nWith no notice or any warning at all.\n\nWhen Marc did decide to talk to me about staying here, he said he was only staying a couple of night until he found a place, which was fine. My roommate felt uncomfortable staying in the same room as them, with only a thin wall separating them so he moved in with the second roommate stating that as it was only a couple of days maybe a week it would be fine.\n\nThe time they spent here eventually spread into weeks and I kept asking when they would move out, and Marc kept brushing me off saying he hadn't found anything yet l, which led to me taking away the car he was borrowing to get to work as he hadn't gotten his license yet even after promising he would.\n\nThey eventually stopped cleaning after themselves and started smoking inside the house even after we had discussed that they weren't allowed to because everyone else living here didn't want everything to smell like the smoke.\n\nLisa got pregnant around the 4 month mark, and stopped working. I again asked Marc when he planned on moving out as he was in the room my roommate's furniture was in and he and his girlfriend were no longer welcome here especially with a newborn on the way. Which sounds harsh, but we all work different schedules, sometimes graveyard and a crying baby was not going to work.\n\nBut Marc responded that since this was his dad's place he wasn't going anywhere. I talked to my father and he said that I should watch out for my little brother more and that he was now going to charge me more money to cover for Marc's share of the rent since his girlfriend wasn't working anymore and my girlfriend was still staying over a couple of nights. \n\nAnd now the baby is here and Marc thinks I'm being an asshole for wanting them to leave.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I did forget to mention that Lisa did continue to smoke and drink while being pregnant.", "created_utc": 1687920851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14kxopk/aita_for_wanting_my_brother_and_his_partner_gone/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or despite your dad saying your girlfriend should be paying a 1/4 rent he's letting his other son and girlfriend live rent free because you and your room mates are all paying a third of the rent?  If your room mates are pay a 1/3 each then they are paying too much because they don't even have a separate room like they did before your brother and his girlfriend moved in.\n\nThe reality is that your brother isn't moving anywhere.... how are the three of you going to like living with a newbon and then toddler?  \n\nThe lease isn't in your name, you and your other room mates are free to move out tomorrow.  \n\nYour brother can sort his own shit out.  You aren't obligated to pay for him.  Your dad can if he wants to but if he doesn't do the same for you, you will then know who is the golden child!\n\nCan you move in with your girlfriend?  Or can you and the other two room mates find another place together?  \n\nIt's possible that if you and your room mates move out, your brother will go to and then there will be no one... but the root cause of that will be your dad allowing your brother and his girlfriend to move in without any discussion with the people currently living there (ie you and your room mates).", "You are paying rent to be controlled and bullied by your own family.  There are plenty of landlords out there that will not move in unwanted roommates and pass the bill on to you.

You\u2019re definitely not the AH because he\u2019s the one profiting off of this. Not only does he get rent money from you, he can also let his son stay there. Definitely not okay to make your other roommate have to move because they\u2019ve taken up the living room. Definitely look up your rights as a renter because letting other guests stay in the apartment you\u2019re renting is definitely not the norm. Also, him trying to charge your girlfriend when you all agreed it was okay is ridiculous. Sounds like he was just trying to make extra money off of her even though she already has a place to live.", "NTA. Move out and find another place to live where you can pay rent to a landlord who won\u2019t force you to support your brother, his girlfriend, and their future baby.", "Can\u2019t help but feel like this has been their plan the whole time. To get you to move out so they could get the apartment for themselves. NTA.", "What on Earth did I just read? So your brother and his gf have been living there for about a year? And you're just getting annoyed enough now to question it?\n\nFirst, find out what the rent for the apartment is if you don't know. If the rent is $1,500 a month, and your parents are charging you $2,000, then they are ripping you off right off the bat. If however they are only charging you $1,000 on a $1,500 apartment, then they are actually helping you out.\n\nSecond, regardless of a lease or contract, you have been living there for a given amount of time which, depending on the country, you likely have rights as a resident. They won't be able to just kick you out. This is important if you want to stay.\n\nThird, your parents can't just arbitrarily change your rent. Your actual landlord can't even do that. The real landlord can come after you for having too many people living in an apartment for a smaller number, however. Again, this would depend on your country, and what sort of lease there is, but it's likely you have broken the lease by doing an illegal sublet which could result in the real landlord evicting you. \n\nFourth, having someone spend a night or two a week when they are literally living somewhere else would not result in more rent. You are allowed to have guests in an apartment and you're allowed to have them spend the night. You don't suddenly get an increase in rent just because your gf sleeps over once in a while.\n\nIn the end, you've let this go on far too long, and it's likely going to blow up in your face, so you either need to sort this out with your parents immediately or start looking for a new place immediately. Get out of the situation as soon as you possibly can.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that if you don't have a lease, you can leave without warning, which might be considered petty, but which I would consider a just punishment for your parents.\n\nNTA... just don't abandon your legit roommates or that WOULD make you an asshole. And no, your brother, his gf, and their kid, are not legit.", "NTA, time to find a way out of the lease", "NTA, but you'll never dislodge this barnacle so long as your dad enables him. I think you should all leave him, his gf, and their baby in an empty apartment.

Leave asap your dads an idiot and your brothers a loser. Your life can be yours..or it can be ruined. Good luck", "Nta but I don't think it will happen. You and you roommate should move out this way your brother family will have a room. Your father just want money from you and roommate just ignored him and more out.", "nta... thats a huge diruption in everyones lives. its not fair to anyone who lives there. You need to evict your brother.\n\nthere are legal things that you need to be aware of. If he lives there for more than a period of time, he may have legal rights, moreso after a baby. the place is your, its no longer your parebts place, your brother and gf are hige AHs and need to be removed. youve been patient enough, nothing good will cone of procrastinating.\n\nIf you can legally throw thier shit outside.. do it.", "ETA- it's a crappy situation but, no one charged you extra for your gf and you wouldn't want your dad to put you out on the streets with a baby. The only logical thing to do is move out with your roommates and leave dad and step mom covering any shortages. \nThey are definitely AH thinking you should pay more to cover for the lack of pay from others.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They won't even be able to come after you for money (I assume your dad would try something screwed up like that), since they've screwed up the living arrangements so badly. If you withhold the rent this month and have a place set up for next month, they literally can't do anything. You'd have two months worth of rent and could get into a place where your father will have no control over the living arrangements. Also, you could get a place with three bedrooms instead of two.

And I think the parent-child relationship trumps the sibling relationship in terms of who gets to be more responsible over your brother.\n\nIdeally your brother should pay his own way. Be responsible for himself, his gf and child. Since he doesn't seem to be able to do that, your father should not transfer that responsibility to you. You are not his parent. Your father is. And expecting you to pay more rent so as to cover your brother is such an a-hole move on your dad's part. Especially since the rent is going to him. It seems like the apple didn't fall too far from the tree when it comes to your dad and brother. Brother has already abdicated responsibility for his own life. And your father seems to be doing the same. Why should you be punished for your brother's decisions?", "But the benefit of having a legal lease is that you can move out immediately and stop paying rent", "This is the way", "Or help brother by moving you and roommates out - him his gf and baby can have whole place to themselves and dear daddy can foot the bill on his own \nNTA leave!"]}
