I never said they always do one.", "Never say never I guess, but this really sounds like an urban legend.\n\nExcept that this really happened to my friend's sister's aunt's dog's daughter's cousin's cat's brother 3rd time removed.", "[deleted]", "To your point on consenting to the test (which you are probably right about), I imagine in some cases people do consent without realizing it. As much as I don\u2019t recommend it, I\u2019ve scribbled my initials down on consent forms without reading every single thing on it. \n\nDo you read every single Terms & Conditions agreement you sign? \n\n(I\u2019m not trying to be snarky or argumentative, just using this as an example)", "[deleted]", "Well, in that case you are probably doing the right/smart thing then. \ud83d\ude05 Just yesterday I skipped through two pages of Terms & Conditions on a video game.

OP's mom is asking for OP to break the law and risk their future for their uncle.", "yea because the war on drugs was so successful, and didn't lead to the over-incarceration (vs meaningful treatment) of mainly people of color suffering from addiction /s.

So your mom is basically coercing you to commit a crime, don't give in, absolutely not. You could get yourself in trouble.

Real friends and family members that actually want to help you, won't do it by enabling your drug using habits. \n\nAnd that was without the very real possibility of going to jail myself be commiting a potential felony (depending on where you live) by covering for someone on parole still abusing drugs. \n\nYour uncle made his bed, now he has to lie in it.", "NTA.
