For about a year, my parents would send me enough money to pay all my expenses (about a minimum wage). They were in a better financial condition by that time, so they could afford it, but it didn't last long. After that, I've started an intership and could pay most of it, but they'd still send me some money (about 20-30% of the initial amount).\r\n\nWhen I started working 6 months ago, I asked them to stop sending any money, and, instead, I started sending them 80% a minimal wage a month. They're not in a good financial condition so I see myself obligated to help. I'm ok doing it, but it consumes about 1/5 of my income.\r\n\n5 years ago, they started renting their own house during the summer so that it would help with their expenses. It lasts from 2 to 3 months every year, and they've always stayed at my place. This always bothered me to the point that I would breakdown because we have a really different way of living, I have my life, my job, my things, and my small house would be completely turned upside down.\r More than that, it would become really hard for my girlfriend to stay at my place, since there's not enough space for 4 people here, and even I sleep in a air matress on the floor of the home office.\r\n\nThey cannot afford to rent a place near their house in the summer, as it would cost them too much of that \"extra\" income, so I've never asked them to do so.\r The past 4 years I would be stressed out, but nothing like this year. I've been working for 9 to 12 hours a day, so all changed this christmas.\r\n\nMy mom asked, aggressively, if they're annoying me. When I said yes, and that it has always been disturbing me, my mom cried a lot and said that she didn't know (even though she saw me breaking down all of those years and knew how stressed I was), and it was a shock for both of them. I've told them that I did not want them to leave now, and told how much I love them and how much I'm grateful for everything they've done to raise me the best they could. \r\n\nI do all of the maitenance in their house, from electrical to plumbing, and many other things such as taxes, tech stuff and also taking care of the AirBnB. None of this bothers me at all, I've been doing it since I was 10 (no joke), but since they live paycheck to paycheck, when something bigger breaks, like an A/C machine or a fridge, they put a lot of pressure on me to fix it, and it also stresses me a lot.\r\n\nWhat I've been telling them for the past 5 years is to sell their house and live with a little lower living standard. This would avoid a lot of debt and also increase their life quality. They always say that they'll do it, but never do.\r\n\nIn the hope that they'll finally do it, I've told them that they'll always be welcome at my house, but not for this long.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1703569108, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r0z1b/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_they_cant_stay/", "score": 13, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.
