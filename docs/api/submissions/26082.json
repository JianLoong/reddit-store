As much as I loved my mom, I know how hard it was growing up under her and how we didn\u2019t have a lot, so when I left for college I did feel guilty leaving my siblings there knowing they wouldn\u2019t have much, but I did so for this very reason, so that I could make enough money to get a house that allowed me to house all of them if needed. They understood why I had chosen to go away to college and didn\u2019t resent me for leaving them there, which I\u2019m so grateful for. \n\nAlthough i am in the position where my siblings can stay with me for however long they need to, I won\u2019t lie and say things haven\u2019t been hard. Especially financially wise, I mean I went from just caring for myself, my fianc\u00e9, and our 2 dogs to caring, clothing, housing, and feeding 3 children who need stability. It was such a shocking flip to my world and I\u2019m just trying my best to do what\u2019s best for my siblings. However one thing 3 teenagers can do is eat. And I fully understand that we grew up in a household where we would have food one week and then be home dry the next two weeks, so we truly never knew when we\u2019d eat a full meal again outside of school. Yet that is not a worry my siblings have had to face here, it takes some saving and budgeting but my fianc\u00e9 and I have come up with a way where we can spend $1,400 a month to fully stock up the house. I have had small conversations about my siblings needing to be considerate of everyone in the house when it\u2019s regarding food and telling them to just take what makes them full and leave enough for others to be full as well. I understand the resources guarding mindset is very hard to get out of, I really do, but what else can I do? Things got bad when my fianc\u00e9 and I went grocery shopping at Costco on Thursday, and we usually buy a few snacks for the kids to snack on or take to school.

You're a good sibling, and I promise you that parenting kids is a constant struggle of questioning whether you're doing it right. So you're off to a GREAT start, and your siblings are going to remember that.\n\nAs for food, nobody can bring up 3 kids without doing some serious budgeting. It's also normal to restrict certain foods. If you bought 50 packets of cookies, that should last longer than a day, and you are NOT gonna buy more treats until next month!\n\nBut kids are always hungry, so think about how you can budget for them to have as much access to SOME food as they want.

I know what it is like having to help teenagers and kids to learn this lesson, and it isn't easy, but it is definitely worth it. Food guarding can lead to the same behaviors spilling over into other areas. One child literally tried guarding everything in the home that was a specific color, including their sisters' underware. Good luck, and keep working with your brothers they will eventually get it.", "If in the US, you might be able to file for survivor benefits through social security for the kids. You're doing great!", "NTA even if those cookies were split between 3 kids, eating that whole pack is absolutely fucking excessive.", "NAH.  Food insecurity is rough. \n\nGoing to be a difficult road going forward.  Not really sure what's the best way to handle a situation like this, just be mindful not to do anything to make things worse.", "NAH.  Food insecurity doesn\u2019t disappear because food is more plentiful now, if anything it can ratchet up the impulse to as much as you can when the food is available in case the food goes away again.  So what your siblings are doing now is absolutely normal and expected for people in their position. It\u2019s going to take time before they start to feel truly secure.", "NTA. When kids have inconsistent patterns of eating, as in one week having food, the next not, or high stress, which it sounds like this is, their hormones get very fucked up. It's likely many of your siblings aren't able to understand portion control because they're either emotionally eating, don't have regulated hormones to tell them when they're full, or their insulin and glucose are all over the place and they're burning through blood sugar. It's really important to ensure that the snacks you provide are high protein to ensure that they stay full for longer. What you've said is totally understandable, but having a conversation about it likely isn't going to change the problem. So diet is the next best way to help this. Higher protein and healthy fats keep us full for longer. Same with complex carbs like whole wheats, barley, yams, potatoes, steel cut oats, etc. Simple changes like this, and high protein snacks literally will help.", "If you live in the US, your siblings could qualify for social security benefits.

They get no more, since the other portions belong to the others in the house. \n\nIf you have a pack of 50 cookies, portion them out into 10 cookies per ziplock bag, and then put each person's name on the bag.", "NTA but it might benefit the kids to see some sort of therapist.\n\nAlso, maybe keep a supply of \"healthy\" snacks on hand instead of junk. For example, my kids can eat any fruits & vegetables, granola bars, nuts, yogurts, etc they want at home but the snacks are reserved for after dinner and school only.\n\nHave you applied for free/reduced lunches at school? If not, see if you qualify. Most schools also offer free/reduced breakfast. That would significantly help offset the food costs at home. My son often eats breakfast at home, breakfast at school, snack at school, lunch at school, healthy snack when he gets home, dinner and then another snack. The kid is an eating machine (he's also only 50th percentile for weight) \ud83d\ude05 \n\nMy friend's son also has a huge appetite. She puts together a basket of snacks for each kid in the morning and those are the only snacks they can have each day.

You did the right thing, but it will take them a while to adjust. Hugs.", "NTA. In addition to a food bank or pantry, you may see if the kids are eligible for some kind of assistance (food stamps or the like). Instead of buying premade cookies, what about buying the ingredients and one day a week, bake something. I do understand baking ingredients can add up, over time it will end up cheaper and may be a way for everyone to work together for something everyone can enjoy. Plus it may help for them to know what day each week or so there will be cookies.", "NTA, and you\u2019ve done a kind thing", "NTA.\n\nYou're not \"controlling what they eat\". You're merely explaining that the food budget is finite, and there is limited room in it for treats such as chocolate chip cookies.\n\nIf they gobble down every treat you buy within the first 24 hours, there will be no more treats until the next shopping trip. That's just a fact. And if one person gobbles them all down before their siblings have a chance to get to them, that will create resentment, so in the interests of family harmony, it's nice to take only a fair share. That's also a fact.\n\nBasically, you're teaching them mature adult behavior. There's nothing wrong with that, and your group member is being ridiculous. (If they think your siblings should be able to eat unlimited treats, ask the group member to fund it.)\n\nSome people in the comments have mentioned food banks. Yes, that may be an option worth considering. So might growing some of your own food if you have sufficient garden space.\n\nCan I offer another tip that may help?\n\nThere have been periods in my life when I've lived in poverty, and I've found that the single biggest change I ever made to cut down my food budget while not feeling deprived in any way was to **cut down food waste**.\n\nTime was, I'd make something for dinner (pasta, stir fry, casserole, rice, roast vegetables), and there would be a serve left over. I'd put it in a container in the fridge, promptly forget about it, so did everyone else, and three weeks later I'd discover it at the back of the fridge sprouting interesting types of mold. Or I'd buy a load of fresh vegetables, put them in the crisper at the bottom of the fridge, forget about them and use canned or frozen vegetables instead, and two weeks later discover the fresh ones gone all slimy and horrible. Or I'd be clearing up after a meal, and discovered that several people had left a significant amount of food on their plates - not because they didn't like it, but because they took too much and then realized they couldn't eat it all.\n\nI thought, that has to change. I have to stop throwing food out. So I made three significant changes.\n\nOne is by telling the family that you can take what you want from the communal serving dishes, but please **take a small serve,** eat at a moderate pace, and then if you're still hungry, you can come back for seconds. Basically, if you put it on your plate, please eat it. Obviously I'm not going to stand over them and demand they eat it - that *would* be the way to an eating disorder! I just want them to be more mindful of what they take, and more conscious of the fact that if they put it on their plate and then don't eat it, it will be thrown out, and that's money down the drain.\n\nThe second change is that whenever I have leftovers, **if they are freezable at all, I freeze them**, no matter how small the portion. I have sometimes frozen leftovers as small as two spoonfuls, and I incorporate them into new meals a few weeks later. Some nights I have concocted rather interesting family dinners out of different types of frozen leftovers - two spoonfuls of penne arrabiata, half a serve of stir-fried rice and vegetables, a portion of chicken korma, three roast potatoes, a slice of home-made pizza... Not the most cohesive dinner ever, but interesting, and the family didn't complain!\n\nThe third thing is that I got an extra container for the fridge, and in it goes **every perishable item that is nearing the end of its life and needs to be used up**. Dairy, vegetables, cold meats, the lot. The container sits at a prominent spot in the fridge. Every couple of days, I go through the fridge, identify what needs to be used soon, and put it in that container. Then when I'm preparing dinner, I look in it first, and try to make use of what's there.\n\nAll these things have significantly cut my food budget, without the family feeling deprived at all. Reducing our waste also helps the environment.", "NTA. I hope you can get extra govt support towards their costs though. Given your mother died and they\u2019re minors there should be some sort of pension towards them.", "NTA. I understand why you don't want to restrict access but you may need to shop more frequently for smaller amts until they learn to self-regulate. You can tell them over and over and they can understand intellectually, but they probably don't actually know when they are full or how much food is enough, and it will take time for them to learn. More than days or weeks.", "Nta at all. $10 per person per day used wisely should keep everyone well fed. I get why they went crazy on the valuable resources (cookies) after growing up with a deficit of food. That's normal and to be expected. It's ok to be upset about it, helping your siblings past these behaviours will take more than a few conversations though. If you can get affordable counselling as a group then I strongly suggest it, there are going to be a lot of emotions to unpack for you all, guidance will help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The healthier foods (e.g. apple has more fiber, more filling) but also didn't need permission. **Rationale**: Children are inherently lazy and they would rather handle it themselves than have to ask permission so my kids opted for the healthier snacks they could get without asking.

Rounding out proper meals with a couple of snacks has worked for us so if he's still hungry after a meal then it's a more meal type so as to properly fill his belly rather than grazing the entire day on shite.", "NTA. \nThey DO need to learn portion control or they will end up with problems regardless. You need to re-establish a healthy relationship with food again. Letting them binge eat constantly and unnecessarily is not going to help them and going to make you broke! \nAs long as you continue to not restrict their food so as to not trigger that resource guarding tendency, their is absolutely nothing wrong with actually sitting down and addressing the problem. Maybe you should look into any nutritional information sessions online or somewhere local? So they can learn what a balanced diet actually looks like", "Nta.\n\nCompletely different situation, but  I am a mother of 3.  If I make chocolate chip cookies, they will eat them all very quickly. So I have to bake a few each night for their lunches to control them.   I don't even buy pre-made cookies anymore because they have no control", "Are you their legal guardian?  I would expect that the state you live should provide assistance for food and necessities.   See what help is available.  And good for you stepping up (and your  fianc\u00e9).", "Thank you so for the advice on the food banks, I\u2019ll definitely be looking into it", "Agreed except I think NAH is more appropriate.  OP and fianc\u00e9 are struggling to afford three kids, and the kids are growing fast and need the food.  Going to a food bank for the extras you need will help.", "I'm sorry.....if she can afford $1400/mo just on food. She doesn't need a food bank. The kids need healthy limits and therapy. I feed 6 people on $500/mo, on good months. I feel guilty hitting food banks. Just....no.", "Thank you, for the advice really. You\u2019re absolutely right about the struggle of me questioning everything that I\u2019m doing wrong. I really needed to hear that I\u2019m not complete evil if I were to restrict treats in some fashion. Again, thank you", "Love this. This idea is great. I was someone who grew up fairly food insecure at times, so portion control and impulse control are not my strong suit. (Tack severe ADHD on to that and you can see where my struggles lie.) Eating food is often a comfort, and can be a very difficult habit to replace when you go from being food insecure to very food secure. So, instead of trying to force myself to stop snacking, filling myself with shame in the process, I buy snacks that are good for snacking. I avoid the sweets by having an abundance of other delicious snacks to much on, mostly guilt free. My favorites include, pretzels (filled with peanut butter even better!), granola, nuts or seeds of any kind, packs of peanut butter snack crackers. I find that these snacks are satisfying, nutritious, and not as addictive or unhealthy as scarfing down a whole sleeve of Oreos!", "Thank you, I have what feels like an existential crisis what feels like every week regarding everything that I am doing wrong by parenting them. So, when I was told I would give them an ED I immediately freaked, but you have no idea how much this comment helps", "I second this as it was my first idea. Also there are other resources for people in this situation. If OP is still in school she should ask about grants or assistance as well.", "I wonder if they\u2019re \u201choarding\u201d them/hiding them somewhere so they know they\u2019ll have it later on?", "Could allot a certain amount of cookies per person\u2026", "Exactly! I have three teenagers and I got to the point where I told them I\u2019m only bulk buying snacks once a month, once it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone til the next Costco run. I make sure to have plenty of regular food stocked and basic essentials for cooking. One of them has become an excellent cook, the others are still a work in progress, but it seems to work well for us", "Not just their hormones, but everything.", "Hey u/General_Version3929 please if you haven't already done so look up what u/Ok_Nobody4967 posted about. SSI benefits may be available to them and for you to use as their caregiver, until they turn 18. While the benefits amount may not be much individually it can help offset finances in what is a trying time period as you are providing for 3 of them.\n\nIf they are eligible and you don't need the money then considering using it to fund their secondary education or vocational training for the future. Often times people don't realize they can apply for this until it's too late.", "Yes, all of my siblings are in therapy. My youngest one just started last week because it took a while for insurance to approve the referral, but we are all in therapy", "Yeah, I was thinking they're all old enough to learn how to cook. It's a mandatory life skill, one or more of them may find out they love to cook, and part of the eating through everything could be because they don't know how to cook so already prepared food goes way too fast. And, they'll be introduced to the wonderful world of leftovers.", "I don\u2019t know what space you\u2019ve got but could you get a set of those plastic drawers and label them? They have anxiety about something they had no control of, so give them that control. They each get a drawer of snacks. You refill every X amount of time. When it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone until refill time. It\u2019ll take a while but each time it\u2019s refilled they\u2019ll start to heal a little knowing the food is coming.\n\nMaybe give them some money to budget their own snacks and stuff. A visible meal plan they get to help weigh in on.", "Mate, these kids don't need more food. Yes, kids who are growing eat a lot of food, but no one of sound mind eats 15-20 cookies in the span of twelve hours. And, it's not just one of them. From your description, they *each* did this.  \n\nYou're doing a good thing, here, in taking in your siblings. No, you won't give them an eating disorder if you implement your plan. Unfortunately, you're out of your depth. Their brains have been wired to constantly worry about food, and just giving them more isn't going to magically fix it. There's a physiological problem that needs to be addressed. The fact it's in the brain, rather than a broken toe or a tumour, does not make it any less real. **They need therapy**\n\nHow's your insurance?", "Food banks need people to utilize them, so they continue to get donations. Don\u2019t feel bad about going there.", "Had something happen to a family member recently and churches are a good jumping off point to find resources. I was pleasantly shocked at how much they helped connect to the right places, even if you're not a church person. It was super helpful and the county human services went above and beyond. Don't be afraid to reach out and good luck! You're being awesome for your siblings.", "It may also help to portion out the treats. Lock them up and each gets 1-2 cookies for dessert after dinner. Establishing healthy patterns of eating may help but otherwise they may need professional help if that fails", ">Also, are they eligible to receive social security benefits?  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10085.pdf", "God bless you.  \u2764\ufe0f", "Where I live, a $1,400 a month food budget for a three (almost) teenager household would be tight. Teenagers eat insane amounts at times. It sometimes seems insane. Your siblings have been through huge trauma and you are actively concerned about additional trauma from the previous food insecurity. It seems like you had your intentions sorted out, and the kids blazing through your Costco trip brought on stress that knocked you off course. If you look around, you will always find someone who will encourage you to be tough on these kids. If they needed some stern reinforcement, you probably wouldn\u2019t be on Reddit, mulling over your guilt that you were harsh about cookies. NTA. Be kind to yourself, be kind to your spouse, be kind to your siblings. You all need a whole lot of love and compassion and forgiveness to get through. \nMaybe try working out your primary goal, your secondary goal, and so on. When you run into dilemmas/ questions/ concerns, ask yourself what actions you would take in this situation to bring yourself toward your primary goal? What actions might lead you away from your primary goal? And so on.\nNot trying to claim that your complex future should be simple to sort out. A (very) complex future needs to be sorted in an organized way so that you can move forward.", "Think about having an abundance mentality, too.   So the message isn't \"we don't have enough!  We have to ration!\" It's \"we have plenty, if we use our resources well.   Here is how we make the snacks last all month.\"", "Parenting is hard! None of us know what we are doing but most of us have babies and learn some stuff along the way (trust me, we still make mistakes) you\u2019ve been thrown into it overnight with three kids who have established personalities and *trauma*. You\u2019re doing great and the fact you\u2019re worrying and asking questions proves that.\n\nJust remember they are old enough for honest conversations. To be involved in the process. They don\u2019t need to know an exact budget but they can be talked to about how mum only had X amount of money but you have Y.\n\nI\u2019ve left a comment above about giving them some control but I want to say I grew up sorta similar and it did lead to some food hoarding tendencies but having control over where the food was and when it would be replaced helped. They will be okay it\u2019s just going to take some time and probably some therapy", "OP what might help is having 3 'snack bins' for the teens. once you buy the snacks that are 'in demand' and tend to disappear, divvy them up into 3 or however works for the kids by preference, then it's up to them to pace themselves. \n\nyou could also give them a certain amount of 'snack spending money' to chose their own special snacks, too\n\nGood luck, OP! Sounds like a really tough time and it sounds like you're doing an amazing job!", "My kids have never dealt with food insecurity but I still have to teach them about portion control. You're not doing anything wrong. Do you let them each add 1-2 things to the list each month that can be just for them? Then once it's gone, it's gone for the month. That way they can pick their own special food that is only theirs and they don't have to worry about anyone else eating. Definitely check into food banks to help supplement.", "Please try not to be so hard on yourself - it\u2019s clear you are doing your best in very difficult circumstances, so kudos to you and your partner for stepping up. NTA", "I have kids that have had a relatively normal childhood with not a ton of trauma who have never been hungry. I\u2019ve had to tell them to slow down on the cookies as well. My oldest ate 7 oatmeal cream pies in one sitting one day (and all my kids are either normal or underweight on the BMI). This is entirely normal.", "well yea obviously, but for most people issues with metabolism start from hormone imbalances both in women and men. That's why I focused on that. The whole trauma / malnutrition and every other effect that comes from that is a whole different conversation.", "You are doing so good by these kids! Props for truly stepping up. A small suggestion may be to limit what is in the house. They have free access to everything and don't feel controlled, but there just isn't as much (especially sweets) to binge through in a short time. Impulse control when a stocked cabinet  is available is probably something they won't develop for a long time. Rational thinking is not the controlling factor right now, and it isn't likely you can talk this through in a way that will alter their behavior.", "I did something like this with my kids. We were having a ton of bickering about who was getting what. Once I implemented boxes for each of them, they never fight about it anymore. They'll often barter or even just straight up put stuff they're less excited about into the others' bins. It's been fantastic!", "Oh that\u2019s a great idea!!", "That\u2019s a great idea.  Love it.", "This right here!!  I grew up food insecure and boy does it fuck up your relationship with food.  They need therapy to address the issues so they can work through it", "I did the math and that's roughly 17 cookies/child. That should have lasted each child 5 days of snacks, if they were eating a *reasonable* 3-4 cookies/day.", "Yeah they already have an eating disorder. Binging is disordered. You're totally right that these kids need help.", "No, don\u2019t lock away any food!  That will just make matters worse.  They definitely need professional help", "I really like this mentality.", "I think your suggestion sounds really helpful!", "But they aren't most people. They're children who have been through food insecurity since a young age. That's probably where you need to start.", "I love when the bartering kicks in! So sweet when they share especially because it\u2019s not demanded. I\u2019m big on the idea (with anyone) of the concept of appreciated instead of expected", "I do a version of this.  It is a basket that is kept on their dresser.  There are arguments when someone eats the last of x.  They each have a supply of snacks.", "If these kids grew up going hungry half the time, it's not at all surprising that they tend to gobble what they have when they have it. That's what they learned to do to ensure they got anything at all. They won't unlearn that overnight.", "Another issue is that they are filling up on junk calories. I'm not against treats but if I were OP I would buy more nutritionally-dense, less-bingeable stuff. Maybe don't buy Costco-sized boxes of cookies but go buy a pack from the grocery store as a treat to be shared by the whole family at the same time?", "It's also possible that they are hoarding the food for later (like, they didn't each eat 17 cookies, they hid the cookies in a drawer or their backpack) which is also disordered eating and a behavior typical of kids who grew up with food insecurity", "No but they can empathize that by gobbling up all the food, they are leaving ***others*** hungry. They're not in cradle school, they're teenagers...", "They're teenagers with maladaptive behaviors due to a trauma background. This isn't something that will be solved simply by telling them \"No, don't do that\"."]}
