My younger siblings were 4, 2 and 8 months old. Dad remarried a year later and my stepmother became mom to my younger siblings immediately. But to me she started out as \"Pam\" and she remained \"Pam\" to this day. I do not consider her my bonus mom or someone I feel that close to. She is not the person I confide in when I need a female role model. I have always felt like she wanted to be, but she's very insecure because she can tell I have wished to replace her with my mom during moments. It bothers her. It now bothers my siblings that I don't have or want the same relationship with \"Pam\" as they do.\n\nBack in February she entered this competition to win a spa day for Mother's Day. Your kids needed to write in but they had to call you mom was one of the rules. She and my dad wanted me to write in with my siblings and I refused to call her mom. She asked me if it would be such a big deal and I said yes. She asked me if I couldn't just once say she's my mom since I don't have to say it out loud. I said no. Then she said it's like I don't even love her when I won't do something kind just once to acknowledge her as one of my mom's. I stayed silent with that remark and my dad flipped and told me I should at least love her for all she has done for our family.\n\nWe started family therapy, Pam, dad and me a month later (March). Family therapy has been weird. We have gone through ten therapists because Pam dominated and refused to co-operate with most and both her and dad refused individual sessions with the therapists, so they would say we needed to find someone else.\n\nThis current one we have seen five times. Which is the most we have been to one therapist.\n\nLast week we had a session where Pam said she feels like she can never compare to mom with me. She feels like I wouldn't choose her and that she will never come first, she will never be a mom to me, and after all these years and all the effort she has made it will hurt. That a dead woman will always shine brighter in my eyes. The therapist asked her why she felt that way and instead of answering Pam went into how it isn't fair. I interrupted and told her it might not be fair but it is the reality and nobody could compare to my mom, nobody would ever come before my mom for me. I told her she cannot compete with the woman I claim as my mom. That she can never be equal. \n\nThe therapist lost control of the session after that because Pam stormed out and dad berated me for confirming her worst fears. Ever since they told me I had no business confirming that and it made Pam feel like crap.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702064389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dura5/aita_for_confirming_that_my_stepmother_is_never/", "score": 474, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she could just let you 'be', and be happy to be in your lives without needing to be called 'mom', there wouldn't be a problem.  She is NOT in competition with a dead woman.  You have a mother, and she is your dad's wife who is also in her life.  I'm sure you can find a place where you call her Pam, and she's happy with it.  She needs to be happy to take whatever role is there for her and I'm sure you'd grow closer if she stopped pushing it so much.\n\nI have a  step mom AND a step dad, neither pushed for me to call them anything aside from their names and never competed against my actual parents.  We have a  great relationship.\n\nNTA NTA NTA\n\nShow this to Pam :)", "NTA. Your dad needs to stop encouraging the idea that Pam can replace your mom. \n\nWere you allowed to grieve fully or were there times when you felt you had to hide your feelings? You might want to ask your dad for counseling just for yourself, if you feel you were ever pressured to get over your mom's loss or otherwise hide your feelings, because marrying after only a year - that's pretty fast, maybe it was enough time for him to mourn, but a kid in the situation your 10 year old self was in might easily be experiencing some bad feelings.\n\nIf your dad thought he could replace his wife and your mom that easily, it is also possible that your younger siblings have more feelings than they are showing. It does not sound like your dad is all that comfortable with your feelings. \n\nAlso Pam might be having some bad feelings herself if she is expected to take over another woman's kids in place of having her own. Not that this is your problem, of course, but if she is having a lot of anger and negative feelings, that might be why. It might not be you at all. It might be that she has her own feelings about the children she'll never have (the children who might have loved her as a mom rather than as a stepmom) and she and/or your dad might be dealing with that by just trying to graft her onto you and you onto her.", "NTA.\n\nAs you are realizing, your dad and stepmom have real issues. I'll just say \"with maturity.\" What I've noticed in children who lose their moms after age 5-6, is that they often grow up very quickly. They know what has happened, they understand the depth of the loss, they grow wise and mature beyond their years. There are other circumstances that can cause this, of course.\n\nSo, as my family therapy professor said, \"The designated patient is often the child and that child has become the scapegoat. The REAL patient or patients is someone else.\" Indeed, I headed off toward child therapy/art therapy after realizing I could not deal with these immature, therapy-needing parents who were blaming their kids. You've probably been their scapegoat at other times in the past. \n\nPam needs individual therapy but will never seek it because it's always someone else's fault. Your dad probably knows this deep inside (and if he doesn't, he's too far gone for therapy).\n\nIt's a very hard phase in life. Go lower contact, see how that feels. Do not put yourself in any situation where you are alone with them. Be courteous and pleasant (it's good practice for adulting) and just tell yourself \"I'll be very good at dealing with difficult people! I have way more experience than most!)", "nta can you talk to your maternal grandparents about this. your dad and stepmom are being manipulative and disregarding your feelings.", "NTA, Pam strikes me as very immature and your dad just... IDK, either doesn't see that or doesn't want to deal with it? Pam is, or maybe both of them are, also very manipulative. What they've done here is a LOT to put on a 17-year-old (or 16yo at the time this whole mess started?).\n\nThe bit of this that pulls me up is you saying your sibs are bothered by you not having the same relationship with Pam. I don't buy that they've gotten bothered about that on their own, that's come from Pam and/or your dad. And that TRULY sucks.\n\nIDK OP, you're definitely not TA but I don't feel like I can think of anything more useful to say to you. But they don't get to control what you think or how you feel, and they suck for trying.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that they refuse individual sessions says it all, in my opinion.", "NTA-save money and get out of that toxic house as soon as you can!", "NTA\n\nYour father and his wife hold on to expactations so incredibly unrealistic, they're borderline neurotic.\n\nEven worse, both of them try to manipulate you. And they are not even good at it.\n\nDo you have other grown up people you can talk to?\nMaybe extended family?\nPlease get as much help as you can. Because your father and stepmother are nothing less than abusive.", "NTA. I feel like if you agreed to call her mom just this one time she would expect it to continue to happen and use the excuse that you already did it once so it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. Pam isn\u2019t your mom and never will be.", "Sounds like you resent Pam for trying to replace your mom.\n\nWhich is fine. There is no moral imperative to feel for someone.\n\nNTA", "I don't get these step parents who try to supplant the parents or overdo the role.  if the kid has a biological parent in their life, that parent is always going to come first.  You might, er \"step\" in if certain kinds of parenting are needed (chiefly the part where you share your lives experiences with the kid, or if somebody needs to pick up the kid from soccer pracrice or something).  But for the most part, the step parent should let the kid decide the parameters of thr relationship and generally look for something more akin to an uncle or aunt type of relationship.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to see her as your mom. Nobody has a say in how you see her. They need to get over it on their own, as you are not obligated to see her differently.", "NTA. Pam and your dad seem to have complete disregard for your feelings on the matter and are instead pushing their own agenda on you unfairly. If your dad met and fell in love with her, great for him, but that does not obligate you to just develop some forced \"mother-daughter\" relationship. Furthermore, shame on Pam. She does not need to be in competition with your mom; She shouldn't be comparing herself to your mom at all because *it's not the same*. You do not need nor do you want that role filled. Your mom will hold that title for you forever, and that's for you and ONLY you to decide. Pam needs to stop fighting that and accept she has a different role in your life. \n\n\nand family therapy is not going to solve anything if she and your dad are not open to actual productive conversation, even about tough topics that are upsetting. Honestly, do you have any other family you can stay with- maybe on your mom's side? It might be the best thing you could do for yourself, to get out of that environment where your feelings are diminished in favor of their own.", "NTA. Nobody has the right to force you to accept her as a mother.", "NTA Pam sounds like a narcissist and your dad is enabling her!", "NTA. You aren\u2019t required to love your step mother as much as your mom. She has a lot of insecurity.", "NTA Pam shouldn\u2019t be dominating a therapy session, if I were you I\u2019d go NC. Your dad will probably never see your pov of this so better to nip that Bs in the bud", "She had no good faith interest in therapy only shopping around to find someone who agreed with her.", "NTA and sorry, but how did your dad meet and marry Pam within a year. Are you sure nothing was going on before.", "NTA\n\nYour dad is for enabling Pam\u2019s behaviour \nAnd Pam is because she\u2019s not your mom she is your stepmother \n\nI\u2019m so sorry they treating you this way", "Your step mother has an unhealthy vision of being a step mother. Thinking that she NEEDS to replace someone is weird and creepy. I feel like she doesn't want you to have space to love both of them (your bio mom and stepmom). She wants it all or nothing. The worst is if she wasn't forcing herself so much into your life, she might have been closer to you.So NTA for stating the obvious. She will never replace your mother. And that's ok !\n\nNow about your siblings. Them not understanding your situation is quite normal. They are still young and have really only known her as a mother figure. Maybe, for the older ones, you could explain to them your point of view so they could understand better. You could tell them: \"Imagine if tomorrow dad were to remarry someone else and Stepmom was out of the picture. Would they want the other woman to replace stepmom and forget about her? Surely not. That's what it is for you\". They don't have to adhere to how you feel, but they do need to respect it.\n\nFinally, your father. He is oblivious and conviniently blind to your feelings. The only thing that seems to matter to him is your stepmother's feeling and vision of her role into YOUR life.\n\nI can see that you have no support right now in your family and must feel extremely alone. I'm sorry about that. I would though agree with other redditors and suggest individual therapy. Do it for you and nobody else. Do it to start healing and to feel better.\n\nIndividual therapy is rarely a lost of time. And since your stepmother took all the place in the other sessions and your father and her didn't seem realy interested in what you had to say, you might feel the desire to express outloud what you always wanted to say but never were able to.  Having someone listening to you and only you and have a real interest in what you feel, can be a really liberating experience !", "NTA\n\nSorry about your mom.\n\nIt's totally ok to feel the way you do  & unfair for anyone to pressure you re your feelings about Pam imo.", "NTA\n\nYour feelings matter, and it sounds to me like you are likely still dealing with the trauma of losing your mother. Yes, this is just armchair psychology, but, what else can internet strangers offer? \n\nI think you should look into PERSONAL therapy. Deal head-on with the loss you experienced at such an impressionable age. You won't heal any outward relationships if you're still struggling with the inward one. And again, I don't know you. So I am only trying to read between the lines of a short post on Reddit. \n\nYou absolutely do not need to call or consider Pam your \"Mom.\" However, even though it is NOT your fault, you may ultimately find that a civil and less antagonizing relationship with her is in YOUR best interest -- especially in how it impacts your relationships with your Dad and siblings. I am only saying you should consider what is best for you in the long run.\n\nI am not saying Pam is right, or your Dad is right, or even that you're right. Adult relationships can be messy. And it sounds like Pam has some serious insecurities. From your description, it sounds like she's taking some of those insecurities out on you. That ain't right. Hopefully some personal therapy can give you tools to deal with her insecurities while maintaining a healthy relationship with the rest of the fam.", "NTA. She is not and will never be your \"mom,\" but to be fair, she has helped raise you for half of your life, so I see how she would feel hurt.", "NTA, but your father and stepmother are.  BTW, she did stuff for your dad, it was his responsibility", "NTA. Your stepmother and dad can dictate how you feel. Very out of line.", "NTA see your father and stepmother are just shopping therapists until they find one willing to bully you into calling Pam mom. If that does happen you should report that therapist to your states governing body.", "NTA. She needs to quit forcing it. Yeah, it was easier for your younger siblings to adjust bc they were so little when it happened. If they (dad and stepmom) want to do therapy right then they would cooperate with the therapist in the first place.", "NTA\n\nKinda irrelevant but I wanted to add that the contest sucks for their rules. Why can\u2019t they celebrate \u201cmoms\u201d in different forms.  It would have been a nice entry to have your siblings viewpoint and also that you appreciate all she does for the family or whatever.", "Too fucking bad. NTA", "NTA.  Your dad just wanted to move on with life and expected you to be able to do the same.  Men absolutely suck that way.  \n\nPam is TAH for thinking she could ever replace your mom.  She might be really nice but she\u2019s not your mom.  And she doesn\u2019t sound all that nice.", "NTA. I think you exposed the elephant in the room and Pam and dad *did not* like it being on display.

Now that it's out in the open they have to deal with it.", "NTA - every problem about stepparents and stepchildren that I seen on Reddit revolves around parents trying to force the kids to see the stepparent as a new mom/dad.  It is never the kids' fault.\n\nPam insisting that she is your mother is only about her EGO.  It is not what's best for you, it's about what she wants and nothing more.  You remember your mother, of course you still wish her to be around.  Your younger siblings adjusted to Pam easier because they were still young enough to move on.", "NTA. Pam sounds a bit unhinged with the storming out and the pressuring others to nominate her for a contest, but even if she were the perfect stepmother no one can replace your mom.", "You had no business confirming the truth???? WTF!!!!!! delulu much, she will never accept the truth, 18 and done!!!!", "NTA\n\n\"Pam should feel like crap, she is trying to emotionally manipulate a child. She is trying to make a child replace her mother. She is pretending to love a child, when in reality all she loves is the *idea* of being a mother. You can tell because we've been to 10 different therapists because she is shopping around for one to change me, instead of listening to the TEN professionals who want to talk alone to *her*. SHE is the problem. She is not my mom, she is my step mom, and we could have had a great relationship, I could have even loved her. But she does not give a damn about anything other than getting what she wants, and I have started to hate her for it, and every day my resentment towards you gets worse for being ok with this.\"", "NTA, it seems to me that they have never once tried to understand your position on the matter. She isn't your mother, and that's perfectly okay, but it's also understandable why your siblings don't feel the same way even though you obviously don't resent them for that. You could just be presenting yourself really well here, but presuming that you're being honest, you've handled this quite maturely for your age. I can understand why you got to the point where you blew up a bit.\nBefore this next bit of advice, I would like to preface that you only do it after you've attempted to explain your feelings, and if your family still doesn't understand you, then follow on.\n\nIf everyone around you is pressuring you to do something you don't want to do and you feel in your heart and mind that is the wrong thing to do then you need to make steps towards either cutting them off or lowering your contact with these people. You obviously don't have the means to do that as a 17 year old but I would suggest getting down to the nitty gritty and moving forward. \n\nEventually, you'll get to a point where you're more independent and can lower contact. I would suggest keeping that door open, though, because you never know how things may turn out in the future but allow yourself some room to process your feelings especially if those around you refuse to validate them.", "This is a weird one, cause you both qualify imo. Other people have said enough about boundaries and consent and whatnot, but you\u2019re pretty disrespectful yourself.

In your mind do you feel Pam is trying to replace your mother? Or do you feel Pam has no business taking on the motherly role? I think you may be looking at it differently than I. For Pam to step in after your mothers passing wasn\u2019t premature. Looked as if she was concerned about the integrity of the family dynamic wanting it to remain intact. I also believe she knew how you felt about it at that time. I tip my hat to Pam for taking on that roll and the hardships that comes with it. Being a stepmom or stepdad takes a special kind of person to step and continue on where the parent had left off.i get the feeling Pam has always known she could never replace your mom so I think maybe she could use some encouragement from you simply saying or acknowledging the efforts made by her to ensure the family structure was still there. You only get one mother and it\u2019s understandable how you feel about your loss. My opinion is that Pam only wants to feel accepted by you in her role. It\u2019s important that it comes from you.

She is not the person I confide in when I need a female role model. I have always felt like she wanted to be, but she's very insecure because she can tell I have wished to replace her with my mom during moments. It bothers her.

She was never able to have kids so she would tell people she hit the family lottery. A husband, daughter and 3 grandchildren. My oldest was 10 at this time and he refused to call her Grandma. She would push it but never in front of anyone else. She also wanted me to call her Mom. That wasn't happening! I tried to compromise and call her Mama (1st name) that wasn't good enough for her so I went back to just calling her by her name only. Also because it just didn't feel right to me.

It must take a lot of preparation. I will always feel like the mom who raised me during my vulnerable years is my real mom, and but I do see how you've always been there for my younger siblings - Dad couldn't do it alone.\" It probably won't work, but it establishes that you're taking the high road, and that she's being petty and demanding.  \n\nGood luck, OP.

For her to ask you to further diminish your mother is horrible and immature; especially at such a difficult time in a young woman's life. \n\nDo not take this as a comparison to your mother because it's not, but I am a fully grown man who had a dog that I loved very much. He and I were perfectly compatible. He's been gone over a decade now and I still can't get another dog because I feel so guilty because it feels like I am replacing him. That's a grown ass man and a dog that lived a full and wonderful life. For this woman to act as though she is the authority on how you should grieve your loss and how you should keep the memory of your mother alive is insane. I think in today's world we drastically over use the word narcissistic but this reeks of true narcissism to me. \n\nThe fact that she has fired that many therapists because none of them take her side is further proof that she is unreasonable.\n\nNot only is she unreasonable, she is also insincere when she says she wants to go to family therapy. No, she wants to pay a family therapist to tell you that you are wrong; that is not what therapy is and that is not how it works. \n\nI'm proud of you for being strong enough to stay true to your convictions and to what you believe is right for you and the memory of your mother. I bet your mother would be very proud of you as well. \n\nFor what it's worth, as a man I can tell you that your father knows you are right. However, he's been backed into a tricky spot here because Pam managed to win over your younger siblings before applying pressure to dad and to you to get you to bow to her greatness. Dad has already lost one wife and your siblings have already lost one mother, so dad is probably just trying to keep the ship afloat so that he doesn't lose a second wife and the younger kids don't lose a second mom. I would imagine that once you are out of the house you will be able to have a better relationship with dad once again.\n\nFinally, it sounds like Pam has not biological children. This often leads to some strange behavior in women as they get older. The women I know who only have step children seem to need a lot of extra validation that they are 'real moms' inspite of never having kids. You will even see this sometimes with people who chose to adopt and not have biological kids. I'm not sure if that's some biochemical issue in a body or what, but Pam might be regretting her decision to just raise someone else's kids and not have her own. My guess, is that no matter how hard she tries, Pam realizes that she doesn't have the same depth of relationship with your siblings as she might have had with her own biological children. Every time Pam sees you continuing to be loyal to your mother all these years after you lost her, it demonstrates to Pam what a truely strong bond can exist between mother and daughter and she probably resents you, and maybe even your father, for never letting her have that bond with kids of her own. \n\nGood luck, and know that your real mom would be proud of you.", " Any chance of you moving in with your maternal family as soon as you turn 18?", "Oh boy.

That is an emotion problem that belongs to Pam, and it is Pam's responsibility to deal with that problem herself. \n\nPam needs to understand that she can't replace your mother. She thinks she can, because she thinks she's replaced your mother for your younger siblings, but ***she's wrong about that, too***. Your siblings may not recognize it, probably because they weren't old enough to remember that much about their relationship with your mother, but that doesn't change the fact that it was just a different relationship from the one they have with Pam. The only *actual* difference between you and them is that they may not remember their relationship well enough to recognize that Pam is delusional when she claims that she's \"replacing\" it. \n\nPam is incredibly emotionally immature for thinking that it's possible to \"replace\" any relationship this way. And your dad... I don't even know *what* to think about your dad for his part in encouraging Pam's childish nonsense. \n\nAnd just so you know, I'm the sort of person who actually throws around the title of \"mom\" pretty easily.

Did she turn your younger siblings against your maternal side? I hope not. She's never going to stop. Wait till your wedding where she throws a fit where she won't be mother of the bride...NTA", "Situations like this are tough.  Do you have long 'til you turn 18? Would any maternal family let you stay there once you do, so you can get a little peace? \n\nAlso, is there any reasonable minded adult that your father would listen to? \n\nGood luck and keep us posted.", "But that's the thing OPs dad doesn't get. Pam became his wife, but she never became OPs mom.\n\nAnd it doesn't matter how much he whines or blusters, that feeling isn't going to happen if OP doesn't want it to.\n\nYou cannot force someone to love.", "You should do therapy just for you first. You had a close relationship with your mom (e.g. scrapping). Within a year, your dad remarries and decides you all need to call her mom. That is not enough time for you to sort through your emotions. Get help first in getting your emotions and thoughts in order. Once you do that, you will be in a better place to interact with your siblings, your dad, and your dad's wife.", "If you go to college, there' almost always free counselling services, if you cannot get therapy on your own at this time.", "I completely understand. I will only suggest that sometimes good personal therapy can help us identify and move past problems we didn't even know we had. It's possible that your Dad is also still dealing with the trauma of your mother's passing, and is acting this way as a crutch to his own mental health issues. Whether or not that makes you feel empathy for him is up to you. \n\nBut beyond all of that, I agree that it's wrong of your Dad and Pam to try and force a sense of \"motherhood\" into your relationship with her. Regardless of their motivations, they should be more understanding of your feelings and situation.", ">They have their ideas of what family therapy should be/needs to be.\n\n...they don't actually want therapy, they want agreement and validation.  Oof.", "Perhaps it is...\nBut ur also hearing one side.\n\nTry being the hated stepmom to a kid, \nwhen u were only ever as good as possible to that kid.\nI've been there. That kid made life with his father difficult for me. Didn't want me there..... \nIt isn't uncommon, and things like that are very likely when the bio-parent has passed away.", "Yeah. I wouldnt be able to judge cause i dont know what it feels like honestly. Its hard \"admitting\" to her being your \"mom\" even for a competition, no doubt.", "I think this is the best approach. All the people saying variations of \"try explaining how you feel one more time in a slightly different way\" are being incredibly naive. If ten (***TEN***) therapists couldn't get Pam to listen to OP's opinions, then it's because Pam is determined not to hear it, just like your mother was. There are no magic words OP can say that can pierce that kind of willful deafness.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't think there's any chance of things improving for OP until she is out of the house. It'll be a lot harder for Pam to brow beat OP if OP isn't physical there to brow beat. Plus, OP will finally have the ability to impose some actual consequences on Pam; if OP can teach Pam that specific bad behaviors lead to (for example) fewer phone calls and visits, that might be enough to motivate Pam to learn to bite her fucking tongue for once. It won't actually change Pam's mind about anything (she'll probably always quietly resent OP for not letting her have her way), but dealing with her will be more tolerable, like it was for you. And if Pam doesn't change even that small amount, fewer phone calls and visits still mean more peace for OP. A win-win either way.\n\nUnfortunately for OP, unless she has a sympathetic relative (grandparent, Aunt, Uncle, etc) that she can move in with right now, it will probably be some time before any of that is an option. Not much for it except to fake what compliance she needs to survive until she can execute an escape.", "It seems like OP was forced to say how she felt and that is part of what caused the blow up in the first place.", "Gold", "Based on Pam's \"performance\" during family therapy, it's the refusal to consider any other perspective but her own that's the issue. What you are suggesting is highly unlikely to work.\n\nPam sees OP as a project and not a person, so the sucking up (\"I value you\") suggestion is more likely to be that glimmer of \"proof\" that some doubling down would be in order, which would only serve to place OP in a worse position.", "This! They want a therapist to them the OP is wrong and needs to submit to Pam\u2019s wishes.", "So you\u2019re projecting your experience on this post, got it. Unless OP is lying about them going through ten therapists in less than a year (an unhealthy choice the adults would have made,) the adults blowing up on OP for honestly expressing herself in therapy/ drowning out the therapist from doing their job, and Pam pressuring OP to call her mom and deflecting the therapists questions; I would say we have a decent enough perspective on this one.", "For me it would be a straight lie to call her mom. It would also be folding on something that has been a long and annoying argument over the last several years.", "If you gave in even once they\u2019d use it in future as part of the manipulation to get you to permanently call her mum"]}
