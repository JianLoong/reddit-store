She\u2019s 14, has some behavioral issues, and had mild drug use. We decided to take her in since my wife knew her a bit and thought she was a decent kid who just needed a chance. \n\nThe placement had its issues. She smoked weed in the house. We told her not to, she did it again. She had friends over, we said no weed, they smoked anyway. Over five months, we had good and bad times, but overall it was working. \n\nWe also have a 5 year old daughter who got Covid at the end of last year and has had a chronic cough ever since. She is on a medication for the cough so she can sleep at night and for when her coughing fits get bad. Sometimes it sounds like she is gasping for air. It\u2019s hard to watch her suffer through this. \n\nLast night the foster had friends over and they smoked again. We had planned on talking to her about it after school today. We woke up this morning and the 5yo starts coughing. We look for her medicine and we can\u2019t find it. My wife finally gives up and goes to the store to buy more. I drive the foster to school and when I return, we find the bottle in her room. It\u2019s not empty so we don\u2019t freak out. I go to work. \n\nLater, my wife goes to give the 5yo more medicine and she realizes that the cough medicine that she found in the fosters room is actually sprite. The foster dumped it all into a sprite bottle and drank it with her friends for a cheap buzz. Don\u2019t know why she filled the medicine bottle back up with sprite, but whatever. \n\nI freaked and had her removed immediately. You can disobey me, you can lie to me, you can steal from me. Once you take from my kid, there is no coming back from that. The fact that she lived across the hall from my daughter and listened to her coughing all day and night and still had the lack of humanity that she felt ok taking her medicine is sickening and represents a depravity I was not prepared for. Behavior issues is one thing, it\u2019s almost universal that you don\u2019t mess with sick kids. Did I overreact?\n\nEDIT: Lots of folks are asking about the medicine being locked up. We locked up all medicine and alcohol. We were careless and left it out this time. We weren\u2019t diligent this time since we honestly didn\u2019t think it was a target; she had only ever smoked weed before. \n\nI\u2019m also seeing posts saying we should have known about her substance abuse issues. I agree. I wish the state had better informed us. We were told she had one marijuana incident before and I thought we could handle that. I smoked weed when I was 14 too. I never knew she did other drugs. I didn\u2019t really consider children\u2019s cough medicine to be a target. It was a mistake. \n\nLastly, we are not foster parents. We did this for a child my wife knew. We were not looking to foster any other kids, we were just trying to help one. We were not prepared for this and are going to focus on our own daughter now.", "created_utc": 1675977078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y6c0j/aita_for_getting_rid_of_our_foster_kid_after_she/", "score": 4068, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Over-the-counter cold medicines that contain dextromethorphan as the active ingredient have also been used, as they can produce similar effects and eliminate the need for a doctor's visit.  \nTo create a drinkable mixture, the cough syrup is combined with soft drinks, especially fruit-flavored drinks such as Sprite, Mountain Dew, or Fanta, and is typically served in a foam cup. A hard candy, usually a Jolly Rancher, may be added to give the mixture a sweeter flavor.  Masking the undesired taste may impair judgement of the potency, which is a factor in overdosing.\n\n[Lean (drug)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(drug))", "NTA I've never locked up medicine, never even occurred to me and didn't know it was a thing people did.

Your heart was in the right place. You gave it an honest try. Fostering is very very hard and not everyone is suited to it. I know I am not.

Not every child can nor wants to be saved , given a better life or uplifted. No matter how you phrase it, sounds like this person is happy on the arc they are on and will continue with or without you. Best to spare her the fights and torment of disappointing you.

You were placed in a terrible position and she was failed by the system.", "While I sympathize, I have to go with YTA.   I *really* don't like that you call her 'the foster'. \n\nThat aside, the fact that medications weren't secured when she'd already broken your rules about smoking was just dumb. \n\nWe kept the medications in a locked trunk when my stepson was living at home, and he didn't even have a drug problem. We didn't know all his friends that well, and there was no need to leave temptation in someone's way. \n\n\nAlso, she has broken the rules and smoked in the house, and it wasn't being dealt with until the following day? \n\n\nBeing a foster parent is hard, and I applaud your good intentions, but you made some bad moves here.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "Info Why didn't you and your wife try to get your foster kid into a drug rehab program?

Surely you wouldn't have thrown them out. The fact that you did in this instance shows me that you were not mentally prepared to be a foster parent and likely not approaching fostering in a productive way.\n\nLook, she shouldn't have taken the medicine. It was selfish of her. But addiction is a mental illness and she is not far enough along in her development to have really thought this through. Plus, it sounds like it was over the counter cough medicine, so it's also entirely possible she just assumed you would buy more, which you did. I'm not saying that justifies her actions, but considering it might not have been something difficult to get your hands on limits the harm caused. \n\nIt sounds like you were both unprepared, overwhelmed with a sick child, and bit off more than you can chew. But when you agree to be a foster parent, you're agreeing to more than just mentoring a kid, you're agreeing to help them heal from their obvious trauma. I can empathize, but none of this warrants kicking the kid out in my opinion, and if it had been a biological child, there would've been no \"returning them.\" I wish you had given her another chance and shown her what forgiveness looks like, what commitment to healing and repair looks like.

Your attitude of \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019d harm our daughter\u201d and calling it \u201cabuse\u201d is really crappy. I don\u2019t think a 14 year old with drug issues is intentionally targeting your kid, she\u2019s clearly trying to numb herself. I highly doubt she thought of it as harming your daughter, especially since you said she liked her. This isn\u2019t an adult with a fully formed brain, this is a very damaged child. SHE is the one who has likely experienced a bunch of abuse. All 14 year olds do stupid things, and it should have been expected that a child with drug problems would attempt to use drugs if she found them. You both should have known better and kept ALL medications locked up.

Please don't take in any more foster kids, you are plainly unable to provide that level of care.

So IMO foster kid's behaviour seems like a clear sign of possible impulse control issues around getting high. \n\nI think I'm gonna go with ESH. Foster kid's sucking is obvious. You kinda suck for not understanding/properly researching what a 14 year old who has a drug issue (even just weed) would need for care before and while fostering them and then kicking her out for the cough meds (which were only even accessible due to your oversight) immediately without calming down to think it through when she predictably stole meds that can possibly get you high. Fostering a troubled kid is a **big commitment** and it doesn't really seem like you took it seriously enough before jumping in. I do get that you wanted to help foster kid and while kind of you to do so, the net effect here is very likely to be that you made things harder for her and hurt her worse then if you'd done nothing for her.  \n\nSide note: Really hope your kid is ok and fully recovers from covid.\n\nEdit - Got more context from comments, changed my vote slightly and removed some criticism of OP.", "I want to say NTA but you guys really weren't prepared to foster and it impacted the life of this teenager. It really is shitty for them to get bounced around and it will make connecting with the new family (and people in general) even harder that they got kicked out.

You failed this child and you should feel guilty because you should have never be considered a foster parent. You decided to give back a child when it got hard for you.

As others have said, she probably wasn't thinking about your daughter and didn't mean her harm. \n\nYou just honestly weren't prepared enough to handle her problems, nor does it seem like actually tried to handle her problems. She needs therapy and counselling more than anything. You should have thought about that before adopting her and pulled out before adopting her.

Throwing her back into the foster system is doing more damage than good and it's likely she won't ever get the help she needs because no one wants to adopt a 14 year old that's addicted onto drugs and has behavioural issues.

If not, then \u201cgetting rid of the foster\u201d (your words) was an overstep when you haven\u2019t tried everything to resolve the addiction the foster child had. \n\nBut if it was genuinely too much to handle, then okay fine. Just remember, this is a foster CHILD. If there is no positive role model to show the foster a better life away from drugs and forgive her for mistakes made along getting her journey of getting clean, she will spiral.

You suggesting that a very specific, singular instance of not locking up over the counter cough medicine is somehow going to hurt his own daughter in future, is laughably ludicrous. Most parents do not have to learn to lock up the over the counter cough syrup. If you want to assign blame, blame the biological parents. But regardless, the kid is not without fault here either. 14 is old enough to understand that theft is wrong, and being an addict does not absolve you from that.\n\nUltimately, he tried his best to help someone in need when it was not his responsibility.

That OP's own kid might grow up and have similar issues and he won't be able to give her away because he doesn't know what to do. The lesson isn't about locking up medication. It's about how when a kid you're responsible for is having serious issues, it requires more involvement and action and support.\n\nOP clearly wasn't prepared for this and might not be cut out for it, but he absolutely needs to learn that when he's responsible for raising a kid, getting rid of them when they're struggling isn't an option. A foster kid isn't a self-sufficient, mentally stable person that had quality support to enable them to function like a healthy person. Therapy is a very small piece of what's required. If OP can't do it, it is what it is. But he better learn that if his own kid starts having issues, he's gotta step it up and not just send them off hoping they'll get fixed up elsewhere.

Often times they bumped around with case workers too. If you explain why you she had to go but that you still care for her.", "I think you're making unreasonable inferences about her caring \"so little for the well being of our most vulnerable family member.\" She knew it was an over-the-counter medicine and therefore knew you could perfectly well drive 20 minutes or less to a store to buy more of it for $20 or less and then start locking up all medications from then on. She also knew that it's extremely unlikely you would kick out your biological child if they stole such an easily replaceable over-the-counter medicine.\n\nI'm not saying you should necessarily take her back. I'm not sure that would be good either for her or for your family, knowing as she knows now how easily you could kick her out again. Maybe you're not cut out for foster parenthood. But your specific explanation of why you kicked her out seems to me disingenuously noble-sounding. None of us wants a sick 5-year-old to suffer. But choosing to deprive a troubled 14-year-old of the only home she had because of one incident that delayed your 5-year-old's cough medicine by an hour or so and could have been entirely prevented if you'd been conscious of the need to lock up all medications in advance seems extreme.\n\nYou made the decision, and I don't think you can really un-make it now. But I'm not going to tell you it was a great decision, either. A yta judgment seems just slightly too harsh, but a nah/nta decision seems too kind to you, and an esh/nta decision seems too harsh toward the troubled 14-year-old (and in the case of esh, also slightly too harsh toward you). So I can't give a formal decision. But the troubled 14-year-old was just doing what you *ought* to have expected a troubled 14-year-old to do. Whereas your behavior seems to me not so much what the 14-year-old *ought* to have expected her adult foster parent to do.", "Again, I don't really agree with the though process here. Was the bottle prescription?\n\nIf it was **not prescription** I would like to outline my argument for thinking she was not trying or even thinking she might deprive your daughter of any medication. I actually believe there is some evidence to suggest she actively tried to prevent this from happening (perhaps after doing something that wasn't thought through.) I am making some assumptions here, so please correct me if any are wrong.\n\n\\- It sounds like from the post that the cough medication is usually taken by your daughter right before bed. In this case, it would not be unreasonable for her to assume if the bottle disappeared, it would be discovered as missing before or at bedtime, and you or wife would simply run out to the store and get more, if you didn't happen to have another bottle or two lying around somewhere.\n\n\\-She was stoned at the time she took it it sounds like, so I'm not sure she was in a state to really think about or understand consequences when she took the medicine.\n\n\\- I still think it could have been one of the friends, see below\n\n\\- I think there is some evidence she may have actually tried to prevent any negative effects to your daughter, albeit after the fact, because of the fact you found the medication bottle in her room filled with Sprite. Here is what that signals to me, as someone that did dumb stuff I should not have as a dumb teen:\n\n* The only reason I can think of to fill the bottle with Sprite and then not drink the Sprite would be to make it feel like the bottle was not empty.\n* Assuming the syrup was the usual red, filling it with Sprite would only be helpful if whoever filled the bottle expected it to not be used for a while, or the person planned on replacing it with real cough syrup before it was used. So if it was that the person who filled it expected it not to be used for a while, it was either not your foster or she at least wasn't sure that was the medicine your daughter takes everyday (I would have expected the doctors to give her something more heavy duty than a regular cough syrup so she might have too.) If she was going to replace it, well, she thought she could go get more and switch it out before it would be used, thus not harming anyone.\n* The interesting thing is that although the bottle was filled with Sprite, it was not replaced in it's original location. This might signify whoever filled it to make it seem full was simply too high and forgot to replace it, or that they did not *want* it to seem like there was medication in the bottle. I think maybe she realized at some point that the sooner it was discovered missing the better, and that's why she kept it in her room. Makes her chances of getting caught better, but makes it much more likely you will get more as soon as you notice it missing, before it is time for the medication to be administered. If she was thinking about it at all, it sounds like she didn't count on you going into/finding it in her room, or why not just replace the bottle in the original location? She may have just thought you would not be able to find it, assume it was misplaced, and get a new bottle before it is needed by anyone.\n* Especially if the medication *was* clear it may be significant she left it in her room. Assuming it was clear, it seems like the chances of her getting caught would be much greater if she put it back in the original location, but she didn't. Why? My guess would be if this is the case that she was willing to risk being caught rather than allowing your kid to have Sprite instead of medication.\n* If it was red, I still think she could have taken a good amount, and watered/sprited it down, or drank all of it and put the sprite in with food coloring and replaced it but again she didn't. She probably wouldn't have been caught had she done that. But your daughter then truly would have deprived of medication. She didn't do this. It could have laziness and lack of thought or that she didn't want your daughter to actually be deprived of medication.\n\nSo I think it might be worth talking to her to see what the thought process was here, and why she filled it with Sprite, why she didn't replace the bottle in the original location, etc. There are a few signs to me that indicate either she was so high from the weed she just wasn't capable of thinking of consequences, or her being concerned and wanting to make sure your daughter didn't actually fail to get any medication. Not saying that means you need to let her stay, but it would be better for both of you to talk it through so she can tell her side and you can hear it.", "As a side note, I'm four months into recovering from COVID with severe respiratory aftereffects - you may want to consider asking her doc about a new treatment plan for your daughter. DXM isn't meant for long-term use. It might take an inhaler or nebulizer to open up the airways so she can clear out more gunk and have a chance at sleeping. Don't wait until she bruises or breaks a rib from coughing like I did.", "Honestly I get where you\u2019re coming from. OP was trying to do a good thing, but by sending her back he\u2019s inadvertently hurting her a second time. Thing is, OP wasn\u2019t expecting to do so.

This is about OP protecting his own child against a potential danger to her. It\u2019s ridiculous to say that his decision to end the foster arrangement of a girl he barely knew, who endangered his own young child, is somehow comparable. \n\nSure, OP was not prepared to take in a child with significant drug issues, but how many parents handle any child\u2019s addiction with 100% complete information on what to do and how to act? Like everything else, there\u2019s a learning curve to it and undoubtedly mistakes would be make along the way. At the end of the day, OP needs to do what\u2019s in his own kid\u2019s best interest, which as tragic as it is, means distancing her from the foster kid. Another commenter with first hand experience has stated that even the foster system will remove kids with substance abuse issues away from young children when they pose a danger to them. How is OP expected to commit to a lifetime arrangement when the circumstances were drastically different from what he signed up for?", "Not a danger to her like at all.

But I'm not sure if this was the right call or not. This lack of empathy your foster kid has towards your own kid is likely something she picked up from not having her own parents care about her own distress. She's repeating learned behavior here. And it's highly likely that she sees getting high as the only way to feel better. That's definitely an addict way of thinking. It's also a sign of some pretty severe emotional trauma.\n\nThe foster kidsneeds therapy, including addiction counseling. If you think she's still worth the effort, family counseling is mandatory. You need to be a part of helping her with her issues and more involved in understanding them. And she needs to understand your struggles and concerns in caring for her. There isnt enough communication going on here. If she goes back in the system, I highly doubt she'll get the support she needs to become a healthy adult. That's just the facts. Being discarded by yet another family and not getting the opportunity to understand why and experiencing more normal punishments is only going to make her life worse.\n\nI don't have the answer for you. We are all only capable of so much. If this is more than you can take on, it is what it is. But I would highly suggest family therapy before having her removed. If your bio kid grows up and does something similar would you kick them out to foster care? Probably not. You'd probably try anything to help them.

Foster parents typically go through programs to learn these things, and to learn when their house doesn\u2019t suit the child. It seems you all didn\u2019t go through those programs, which is a disservice to you all. Empathy for a teen doesn\u2019t prepare you for what you will actually have to face.

Unfortunately the lung damage is irreversible and I will probably require a lung transplant before I'm 35.\n\nSorry. I don't know why I'm typing this. Smoke and lung issues are a trigger for me.", "I tend to agree with the comment below. This wasn't some fancy prescription she needed to live, it was over the counter cough medicine. Was it an AH move on the teens part? Absolutely. This didn't put your child's life in jeopardy and it isn't reasonable to think that a teen would perceive it that way. I can't imagine how tough this is for you, but I am sure it is harder for the teen. This is going to cause her life long abandonment issues. I don't think the punishment fits the crime.", "It\u2019s ok, sometimes we need to get that crap out of our brains. I\u2019m so sorry your family did that to you that\u2019s horrible. A friends sister passed from cystic fibrosis and one of the other siblings has it as well, he\u2019s doing ok though. It\u2019s hard, scary, and you have to do everything you can as a family to help your kid and yours failed you. I hope you\u2019re able to care for yourself as an adult\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "As someone with athsma that is entirely triggered by something in cigarette smoke, whose mother's car was covered in 1/2 inch layer of ashes I get you completely.  When i went from hyper exposed to not around her at all I became extremely sensitive and actively avoid exposure.", "My heart breaks for the foster child. However, as a parent, I would take someone stealing my silver or running an Only Fans far more lightly than someone taking my child's medicine.", "What are you a stupid teenager or something? You can\u2019t fix someone else unless they want to fix themselves. Did OP get this 14 year old hooked on drugs?", "Here's the thing, if the 14yo was their own daughter, what would they have done then? Would they kick her out or would they give her an appropriate punishment? If you say that is different, then you also shouldn't be a foster parent ever. If you see foster children as disposable because of their behavior, you are viewing them as objects and not human beings. Anyone who fosters should treat the children they foster as if they are their own. Not as though they are doing them a favor. Not everyone is built to be a foster parent. People love their biological children because they are programmed to. You have to choose to love foster and adopted children. Not everyome is capable of that.", "What if it rained bananas?\n\nWhen dealing with vulnerable people, especially ones you've decided to take into your care, this is unproductive thinking and usually just a quick justification for discriminatory action.\n\nNot saying her actual actions don't need addressing, and hypotheticals are good to ensure you protect yourself and the person from themselves, but.... really.", "The OP and his wife left a medication out of a locked area because they were being 'lazy\"... A medication that can induce a buzz. \n\nThe 5 year old could've easily taken the medication and overdosed. What medication is it?\n\n Because most medication for respiratory issues like asthma are inhalers or nebulizer and these most definitely can't be mixed with soda for a high. I'm a pediatric nurse and I have some serious questions about how the doctor is treating a cough so severe it causes respiratory distress with cough medicine instead or in conjunction of bronchodilators and inhaled steroids. And again if the medication is so potent why isn't secured at all times?", "Exactly...this kid has problems and needs to be helped through them. Kids do dumb shit, they experiment. OP even said he smoked weed as a kid. Just because she's older doesn't mean she automatically does everything perfectly and knows full consequences of her actions. Hows she supposed to know stuff like \"giving kids drugs in our house could cause your foster parents legal problems\"", "Yess. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying really. I realize they had good intentions and didn\u2019t set out to do *that* but they did. \n\nAn extremely common thing for foster kids to do is intentionally fuck up their own situation so that when the family *inevitably* kicks them out, they can feel some semblance of control. \u201cYes, of course I got kicked out, I did bad, it\u2019s just as I planned.\u201d \n\nOr to do bad when they start feeling comfortable to see if the family actually gives a shit. When they\u2019re booted it\u2019s \u201cI knew they didn\u2019t care.\u201d Rinse and repeat \n\nRegardless of the childs intentions, they walk away feeling like shit and likely justified in their bad acts. \n\nThen there\u2019s the abuse. She\u2019s probably doing things that were done to her, or she\u2019s seen done. We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s gone through and what she *actually* knows as \u201creprehensible\u201d ie taking the cough syrup. (Ofc she knows it\u2019s bad, but does she realize actually how bad?) \n\nI could keep going since this is a just pinhole in all the possibilities but I won\u2019t. \n\nIt\u2019s cool they thought they could do it, but some research and informed decisions woulda been better. Especially *especially* since they have a young child.", "I think OP made it clear they are not a foster parent per se, they were trying to help out a kid they knew. They did not know what it means to immediately remove a foster kid and what happens afterwards. From the perspective of a parent who was trying really hard to help a kid in trouble who later turned out to actively make the life of a much younger kid who\u2019s already sick even worse - yeah I can see how they got really angry and had the kid removed. Like what kind of a shitty thing to do is that, its almost sociopathic behavior and I would not want such a person anywhere near my family. This is not the same as if she stole some money from the parents or vandalism or some other dumb thing teenagers do.", "I think it\u2019s awfully sad this young girl was depending on them for a safe family and home environment. She had issues, but when you take in a child you treat them as your own. They obviously played favorites, and I think this is going to widen that child\u2019s gap toward trusting other caregivers. You shouldn\u2019t take on this big responsibility unprepared. I feel bad for that girl. Immediately thrown out for some cough syrup. It\u2019s a tough situation but damn, telling her she isn\u2019t worth a bottle of cough syrup is fucked up. She needed therapy, love, and maybe rehab if her drug use is really bad, not to be thrown out on the streets.", "Good point. I had not thought of that", "they were a kinship placement and never got any training.  op added an edit", "Thank you for someone else being bothered by OP referring to the child as \"the foster.\"", "She thought you cared about her, and you\u2019ve made her homeless, and vulnerable to abuse, and she\u2019s a CHILD. I understand why you decided not to keep her in your home, your first duty is to your daughter. \n\nBut I do find it disturbing that you refer to her as depraved, lacking in humanity, and sickening, when she (yes, wrongly) likely figured you could just get more OTC cough syrup, yet she has been made homeless by your actions. I think you should really think about the words you are using to describe a child for stealing OTC cough syrup and when own choice has put her in a truly horrible position.\n\nI am so sorry for what your daughter is going through. That\u2019s heartbreaking for any parent. Seeing your child suffer is devastating. I definitely sympathize.", "don\u2019t be so hard on yourself. i think in her own way, she did care but she was probably pushing you away because she needed to test you. you did the best you could and your best was far better than most have done for her. you did the right thing and you all are great souls", "She\u2019s a teenager, YTA and the fact that you can\u2019t see that is sad!", "Playing favorites? I don\u2019t even know either of the two kids, but if you tell me a 14 yr old kid intentionally took medicine away from a 5 year old who was chronically ill to get high with their friends, knowing fully well the 5 year old is not able to sleep well because of coughing - you have a really really shitty kid in your hands. Like, this is worse than stealing money from the parents or vandalism or other stupid things teens do. I don\u2019t even know these people and I\u2019m hardly surprised they prioritized the health of the - let me repeat - 5 year old child.", "He\u2019s most certainly not the AH! Have you been reading any of the other comments? The whole situation is sad, but he did what he felt was necessary to protect his child. That poor girl shouldn\u2019t have even been in that house to begin with because they weren\u2019t prepared to handle her very real behavioral issues! She needs people who have been there done that and know how to help. Yes she is just a teenager but she\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s going through very heavy things at such a young age. She needs help from people who know what they\u2019re doing. This man is not the AH.", "That\u2019s a really, really wonderful suggestion.", "But stealing from him is ok?", "I honestly am surprised you made it this far with smokers in the house. That is abhorrent. I had a friend with CF (we graduated 2005) that passed the year we graduated. I am so mad on your behalf. It is so beyond okay. Do you have support anywhere else? I know the damage is done, there are frequent hospital visits, I can't imagine the feeling of the inability to breath, the mucus, etc. I would imagine this behavior would give ptsd. I don't even know what to say that might help. I am so ashamed of your family.", "I'm not sure OP would be best for this, given that they threw her out of their lives after she used over the counter cough syrup. \n\nI'm sure the delay getting a replacement caused the daughter some distress, but if all she had been given by docs was that medicine, it's unlikely she had serious breathing issues. People upthread are asking whether OP would have kicked a biological child out over this. The ex-foster child no doubt knows very well they would not.", "Also some traits like for instance lack of empathy, are genetic and need specialised guidance.", "She\u2019s an at risk teenager that did what at risk teenagers do, it was 100% on them to lock the meds up and they were careless, op is 100% at fault and put it on the foster kid!", "ITA with all of this. Some of the comments in this post are insane to me. This was cough medicine that for all intents and purposes was the household supply of cough medicine, anyone could take it if they needed it. Yes, the kid took it recreationally which is bad. But this foster kid obviously has issues and getting kicked out / rejected like this isn't going to help, probably did way more harm then help at this point on the balance sheet. On top of that they were negligent about keeping it out, but they punish the foster. Once they took the foster kid into their household, they should treat her like an actual part of the HH, not like some second class citizen \"oh you STOLE from MY kid\". To me there's no difference between this and like... the kid giving all her friends popsicles the daughter really liked and eating them all, and kicking them out for it.", "They were misinformed about the girl. They were told pot was all she did. They tried to help the best they could. Unfortunately she crossed too many lines and she messed it up for herself. We don't know her background or what kind of up bringing she had, if any. We don't know if she's even in foster care. You're going off a little information and making it this big thing. The fact is you just don't know enough information to argue this case.", "Exactly.\n\nWhen you take in a kid in that way, you're making a commitment.\n\nIf they wouldn't kick out their biological kid why is it OK to kick out this other one?\n\nIt also sounds like they knew ahead of time that she had substance abuse issues. Is she in therapy and support groups? Are OP and their partner helping her make healthy friendships? Are they telling her that cannabis can have a negative effect on a developing brain even though it is not inherently problematic, or just telling her not to smoke?\n\nTeenagers experiment with sex, drugs, and alcohol. They're discovering who they are. And this particular teenager did not have a healthy home and did not learn healthy coping skills.\n\nShe's doing drugs because she needs help coping with her trauma and because she's desperate to belong with her friends. It was supposed to be OP's responsibility to help her cope with these issues.", "The child repeatedly violated a clear, simple rule, and selfishly put the health and well being of a little girl aside so she could steal her medicine.  Perhaps her learning that her actions have consequences will help her make better choices with the next people who try to help her.  She has to be held accountable in a way that makes her aware that actions have consequences .  kt"]}
