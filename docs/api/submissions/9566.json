She\u2019s 14, has some behavioral issues, and had mild drug use. We decided to take her in since my wife knew her a bit and thought she was a decent kid who just needed a chance. \n\nThe placement had its issues. She smoked weed in the house. We told her not to, she did it again. She had friends over, we said no weed, they smoked anyway. Over five months, we had good and bad times, but overall it was working. \n\nWe also have a 5 year old daughter who got Covid at the end of last year and has had a chronic cough ever since. She is on a medication for the cough so she can sleep at night and for when her coughing fits get bad. Sometimes it sounds like she is gasping for air. It\u2019s hard to watch her suffer through this. \n\nLast night the foster had friends over and they smoked again. We had planned on talking to her about it after school today. We woke up this morning and the 5yo starts coughing. We look for her medicine and we can\u2019t find it. My wife finally gives up and goes to the store to buy more. I drive the foster to school and when I return, we find the bottle in her room. It\u2019s not empty so we don\u2019t freak out. I go to work. \n\nLater, my wife goes to give the 5yo more medicine and she realizes that the cough medicine that she found in the fosters room is actually sprite. The foster dumped it all into a sprite bottle and drank it with her friends for a cheap buzz. Don\u2019t know why she filled the medicine bottle back up with sprite, but whatever. \n\nI freaked and had her removed immediately. You can disobey me, you can lie to me, you can steal from me. Once you take from my kid, there is no coming back from that. The fact that she lived across the hall from my daughter and listened to her coughing all day and night and still had the lack of humanity that she felt ok taking her medicine is sickening and represents a depravity I was not prepared for. Behavior issues is one thing, it\u2019s almost universal that you don\u2019t mess with sick kids. Did I overreact?\n\nEDIT: Lots of folks are asking about the medicine being locked up. We locked up all medicine and alcohol. We were careless and left it out this time. We weren\u2019t diligent this time since we honestly didn\u2019t think it was a target; she had only ever smoked weed before. \n\nI\u2019m also seeing posts saying we should have known about her substance abuse issues. I agree. I wish the state had better informed us. We were told she had one marijuana incident before and I thought we could handle that. I smoked weed when I was 14 too. I never knew she did other drugs. I didn\u2019t really consider children\u2019s cough medicine to be a target. It was a mistake. \n\nLastly, we are not foster parents. We did this for a child my wife knew. We were not looking to foster any other kids, we were just trying to help one. We were not prepared for this and are going to focus on our own daughter now.", "created_utc": 1675977078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y6c0j/aita_for_getting_rid_of_our_foster_kid_after_she/", "score": 1140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Over-the-counter cold medicines that contain dextromethorphan as the active ingredient have also been used, as they can produce similar effects and eliminate the need for a doctor's visit.  \nTo create a drinkable mixture, the cough syrup is combined with soft drinks, especially fruit-flavored drinks such as Sprite, Mountain Dew, or Fanta, and is typically served in a foam cup. A hard candy, usually a Jolly Rancher, may be added to give the mixture a sweeter flavor.  Masking the undesired taste may impair judgement of the potency, which is a factor in overdosing.\n\n[Lean (drug)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(drug))", "NTA I've never locked up medicine, never even occurred to me and didn't know it was a thing people did.

Your heart was in the right place. You gave it an honest try. Fostering is very very hard and not everyone is suited to it. I know I am not.

Not every child can nor wants to be saved , given a better life or uplifted.

I\u2019ve had a lot of foster children in my family. 5 months is a long time to have a foster kid, especially one with behavioral problems.

The majority of the blame for this however, lies with the Department for placing this girl with a foster family in the first place.

I *really* don't like that you call her 'the foster'. \n\nThat aside, the fact that medications weren't secured when she'd already broken your rules about smoking was just dumb. \n\nWe kept the medications in a locked trunk when my stepson was living at home, and he didn't even have a drug problem. We didn't know all his friends that well, and there was no need to leave temptation in someone's way. \n\n\nAlso, she has broken the rules and smoked in the house, and it wasn't being dealt with until the following day? \n\n\nBeing a foster parent is hard, and I applaud your good intentions, but you made some bad moves here.", "Info: How would your reaction differed if she was your bio child?\n\nI feel you over reacted.

Surely you wouldn't have thrown them out. The fact that you did in this instance shows me that you were not mentally prepared to be a foster parent and likely not approaching fostering in a productive way.\n\nLook, she shouldn't have taken the medicine. It was selfish of her. But addiction is a mental illness and she is not far enough along in her development to have really thought this through. Plus, it sounds like it was over the counter cough medicine, so it's also entirely possible she just assumed you would buy more, which you did. I'm not saying that justifies her actions, but considering it might not have been something difficult to get your hands on limits the harm caused. \n\nIt sounds like you were both unprepared, overwhelmed with a sick child, and bit off more than you can chew. But when you agree to be a foster parent, you're agreeing to more than just mentoring a kid, you're agreeing to help them heal from their obvious trauma. I can empathize, but none of this warrants kicking the kid out in my opinion, and if it had been a biological child, there would've been no \"returning them.\" I wish you had given her another chance and shown her what forgiveness looks like, what commitment to healing and repair looks like.

Your attitude of \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019d harm our daughter\u201d and calling it \u201cabuse\u201d is really crappy. I don\u2019t think a 14 year old with drug issues is intentionally targeting your kid, she\u2019s clearly trying to numb herself. I highly doubt she thought of it as harming your daughter, especially since you said she liked her. This isn\u2019t an adult with a fully formed brain, this is a very damaged child. SHE is the one who has likely experienced a bunch of abuse. All 14 year olds do stupid things, and it should have been expected that a child with drug problems would attempt to use drugs if she found them. You both should have known better and kept ALL medications locked up.

Please don't take in any more foster kids, you are plainly unable to provide that level of care.

This is pretty typical of a kid in this situation and while it\u2019s not ok, kicking her out seems pretty compassionless and nuclear.

So IMO foster kid's behaviour seems like a clear sign of possible impulse control issues around getting high. \n\nI think I'm gonna go with ESH. Foster kid's sucking is obvious. You kinda suck for not understanding/properly researching what a 14 year old who has a drug issue (even just weed) would need for care before and while fostering them and then kicking her out for the cough meds (which were only even accessible due to your oversight) immediately without calming down to think it through when she predictably stole meds that can possibly get you high. Fostering a troubled kid is a **big commitment** and it doesn't really seem like you took it seriously enough before jumping in. I do get that you wanted to help foster kid and while kind of you to do so, the net effect here is very likely to be that you made things harder for her and hurt her worse then if you'd done nothing for her.  \n\nSide note: Really hope your kid is ok and fully recovers from covid.\n\nEdit - Got more context from comments, changed my vote slightly and removed some criticism of OP.", "I want to say NTA but you guys really weren't prepared to foster and it impacted the life of this teenager.

As others have said, she probably wasn't thinking about your daughter and didn't mean her harm. \n\nYou just honestly weren't prepared enough to handle her problems, nor does it seem like actually tried to handle her problems. She needs therapy and counselling more than anything. You should have thought about that before adopting her and pulled out before adopting her.

If not, then \u201cgetting rid of the foster\u201d (your words) was an overstep when you haven\u2019t tried everything to resolve the addiction the foster child had. \n\nBut if it was genuinely too much to handle, then okay fine. Just remember, this is a foster CHILD. If there is no positive role model to show the foster a better life away from drugs and forgive her for mistakes made along getting her journey of getting clean, she will spiral.

The foster daughter is a troubled teen who\u2019s been in the house for five months. \n\nOf course these two things are not the same! And they don\u2019t have to be treated the same way or loved the same way or forgiven their misdeeds the same way. The children are totally different people from different places in different life stages. \n\nPeople can be fond of a child, and want to do right by them, and offer them shelter and therapy and guardianship, without having to love them as they do their own kid. That\u2019s a hugely unrealistic expectation.", "It\u2019s literally common sense.", "So what, the foster kid should not have to take responsibility for her own choices? No accountability whatsoever on her part? Her drug use is all on OP? Ffs. OP did not \u201churt\u201d anyone, and he was not \u201cignorant.\u201d He was misinformed of the situation, which was unfortunate, but he is not ultimately at fault for her issues. You suggesting that a very specific, singular instance of not locking up over the counter cough medicine is somehow going to hurt his own daughter in future, is laughably ludicrous. Most parents do not have to learn to lock up the over the counter cough syrup. If you want to assign blame, blame the biological parents. But regardless, the kid is not without fault here either. 14 is old enough to understand that theft is wrong, and being an addict does not absolve you from that.\n\nUltimately, he tried his best to help someone in need when it was not his responsibility. Do you think she would be better off if he hadn\u2019t? People aren\u2019t perfect. What was the lesser of two evils here, letting her fend for herself or taking her in and making one mistake?\n\nNTA", "Despite your many downvotes, I agree with you. While I understand that they \u201c*meant well*\u201d they did nothing but harm to both their biological child and the foster child. \n\nHow they could go into such a big decision with such little foresight astounds me. \u201cShe\u2019s not a puppy, she\u2019s a person.\u201d Too right.", "Love and parenthood is not supposed to be conditional. I will never agree to what he did. Never.huge asshole", "Stealing OTC cough syrup is not putting anyone in danger. It\u2019s a weak excuse from a weak man", "On the flip side while my friends and I smoked weed and drank a little none of us stole cough syrup from a little girl. \n\nYTA", "I was waiting for someone to finally say this besides me on this thread because I think it\u2019s super weird they expect this of this person. They\u2019re not even talking about adoption. This is a temporary placement. Why on earth would they treat this the same as a bio kid? Fostering does not always mean forever.", "For me the focus was that it was something my youngest needed to feel well. She\u2019s coughing and hacking up mucus for over a month. Taking medicine that was not in use would not have resulted in expulsion. Taking alcohol or anything else that doesn\u2019t harm my daughter would not have resulted in expulsion. It was about the fact that she cared so little for the well being of our most vulnerable family member. I was too scared of the next time.", "I'm not assuming. It's pretty clear that op isn't trauma informed, and they've admitted that they had no idea what they were getting into in the comments.\n\nYou can try to do good things, but impact matters more than intent every single time. And because op was ill prepared for taking care of a traumatized teenager, they impacted her life in a meaningfully negative way.", "Dude, reading this, I think you tried to really help someone which is so admirable. What's terribly ironic and not unusual with foster situations is that the kid is so skeptical and jaded (justifiably) that when they finally hit upon a situation that can help them, they sabotage it. And then the real irony hits because even this experience that could have worked out reinforces what they've already experienced. \n\nI'm doubtful anyone would have done any differently. You are definitely NTA, but more than that, I admire what your wife and you tried to do.", "I'm with you, OP. I think you're NTA. I was just expanding on the comment I replied to. The kid may be in a phase, she may be acting out. Either way, you did what you did to take care of your youngest. It's crappy that you got put in this situation at all, but I don't fault you for your response.", "You are assuming. Check out the rest of their comments. They had her in multiple types of therapy including art based therapy (due to her specific interests)  and on a waitlist for rehab. Yes they didn't know that she had more intense needs, traumas and problems than what they were told. I betting it was actively hidden due to the severity.", "Thank you. I\u2019m trying to respond to as much as I can so that there are no misunderstandings. I appreciate your feedback."]}
