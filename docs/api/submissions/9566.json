She\u2019s 14, has some behavioral issues, and had mild drug use. We decided to take her in since my wife knew her a bit and thought she was a decent kid who just needed a chance. \n\nThe placement had its issues. She smoked weed in the house. We told her not to, she did it again. She had friends over, we said no weed, they smoked anyway. Over five months, we had good and bad times, but overall it was working. \n\nWe also have a 5 year old daughter who got Covid at the end of last year and has had a chronic cough ever since. She is on a medication for the cough so she can sleep at night and for when her coughing fits get bad. Sometimes it sounds like she is gasping for air. It\u2019s hard to watch her suffer through this. \n\nLast night the foster had friends over and they smoked again. We had planned on talking to her about it after school today. We woke up this morning and the 5yo starts coughing. We look for her medicine and we can\u2019t find it. My wife finally gives up and goes to the store to buy more. I drive the foster to school and when I return, we find the bottle in her room. It\u2019s not empty so we don\u2019t freak out. I go to work. \n\nLater, my wife goes to give the 5yo more medicine and she realizes that the cough medicine that she found in the fosters room is actually sprite. The foster dumped it all into a sprite bottle and drank it with her friends for a cheap buzz. Don\u2019t know why she filled the medicine bottle back up with sprite, but whatever. \n\nI freaked and had her removed immediately. You can disobey me, you can lie to me, you can steal from me. Once you take from my kid, there is no coming back from that. The fact that she lived across the hall from my daughter and listened to her coughing all day and night and still had the lack of humanity that she felt ok taking her medicine is sickening and represents a depravity I was not prepared for. Behavior issues is one thing, it\u2019s almost universal that you don\u2019t mess with sick kids. Did I overreact?\n\nEDIT: Lots of folks are asking about the medicine being locked up. We locked up all medicine and alcohol. We were careless and left it out this time. We weren\u2019t diligent this time since we honestly didn\u2019t think it was a target; she had only ever smoked weed before. \n\nI\u2019m also seeing posts saying we should have known about her substance abuse issues. I agree. I wish the state had better informed us. We were told she had one marijuana incident before and I thought we could handle that. I smoked weed when I was 14 too. I never knew she did other drugs. I didn\u2019t really consider children\u2019s cough medicine to be a target. It was a mistake. \n\nLastly, we are not foster parents. We did this for a child my wife knew. We were not looking to foster any other kids, we were just trying to help one. We were not prepared for this and are going to focus on our own daughter now.", "created_utc": 1675977078, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10y6c0j/aita_for_getting_rid_of_our_foster_kid_after_she/", "score": 286, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I think the foster really needs to enter some kind of substance abuse program.

It sucks, because your former foster child deserves that same protection.

Over-the-counter cold medicines that contain dextromethorphan as the active ingredient have also been used, as they can produce similar effects and eliminate the need for a doctor's visit.  \nTo create a drinkable mixture, the cough syrup is combined with soft drinks, especially fruit-flavored drinks such as Sprite, Mountain Dew, or Fanta, and is typically served in a foam cup. A hard candy, usually a Jolly Rancher, may be added to give the mixture a sweeter flavor.  Masking the undesired taste may impair judgement of the potency, which is a factor in overdosing.\n\n[Lean (drug)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_(drug))", "NTA I've never locked up medicine, never even occurred to me and didn't know it was a thing people did.

Your heart was in the right place. You gave it an honest try. Fostering is very very hard and not everyone is suited to it. I know I am not. I appreciate those in my community that are and I regularly show my support with my checkbook. It sounds like the youngster really wasn\u2019t interested in trying and did not have the same ideals and goals as you. This is very important for the relationship to work. Effort on both sides. Not every child can nor wants to be saved , given a better life or uplifted. No matter how you phrase it, sounds like this person is happy on the arc they are on and will continue with or without you. Best to spare her the fights and torment of disappointing you.

You weren't in a position to be able to do that.", "More than a judgement on your reaction, I don\u2019t think you and your wife should ever foster again. Seriously. I\u2019m sure you meant well and are lovely people, but you weren\u2019t/aren\u2019t prepared for handling what comes with a child who has been in the system as long as she has. She\u2019s a person, not a puppy, and sending her back into the system that failed her accomplishes nothing but more damage.

I\u2019ve had a lot of foster children in my family. 5 months is a long time to have a foster kid, especially one with behavioral problems. Unfortunately it sounds like they needed a higher level of care and it was a bad fit for you family. You made the right call. You welcomed her into your home for five months, don\u2019t feel like you didn\u2019t try to help.", "Honestly? ESH. The14 year old shouldn't have stolen meds from the sick kid, and you suck for taking in a foster with KNOWN substance abuse problems that you weren't prepared to handle. The majority of the blame for this however, lies with the Department for placing this girl with a foster family in the first place. This child should have been placed in a rehab center or a group home that was better suited for her addiction issues. You were placed in a terrible position and she was failed by the system.", "While I sympathize, I have to go with YTA.   I *really* don't like that you call her 'the foster'. \n\nThat aside, the fact that medications weren't secured when she'd already broken your rules about smoking was just dumb. \n\nWe kept the medications in a locked trunk when my stepson was living at home, and he didn't even have a drug problem. We didn't know all his friends that well, and there was no need to leave temptation in someone's way. \n\n\nAlso, she has broken the rules and smoked in the house, and it wasn't being dealt with until the following day? \n\n\nBeing a foster parent is hard, and I applaud your good intentions, but you made some bad moves here.", "Info: How would your reaction differed if she was your bio child?\n\nI feel you over reacted. I don't disagree with the spirit of why and what you did but I feel this could have been handled differently", "ESH.\n\nWhile it's wrong of her to steal your daughters medication, if she had shown signs of substance abuse (such as smoking in the house when you told her not to) you should have known better to lock said medication away", "Info Why didn't you and your wife try to get your foster kid into a drug rehab program? Seems like something that should have been considered.", "YTA.\n\n\\-- You had someone with a known drug problem in the house and didn't secure anything she might use.\n\n\\-- What would you have done if this was a biological child? Surely you wouldn't have thrown them out. The fact that you did in this instance shows me that you were not mentally prepared to be a foster parent and likely not approaching fostering in a productive way.\n\nLook, she shouldn't have taken the medicine. It was selfish of her. But addiction is a mental illness and she is not far enough along in her development to have really thought this through. Plus, it sounds like it was over the counter cough medicine, so it's also entirely possible she just assumed you would buy more, which you did. I'm not saying that justifies her actions, but considering it might not have been something difficult to get your hands on limits the harm caused. \n\nIt sounds like you were both unprepared, overwhelmed with a sick child, and bit off more than you can chew. But when you agree to be a foster parent, you're agreeing to more than just mentoring a kid, you're agreeing to help them heal from their obvious trauma. I can empathize, but none of this warrants kicking the kid out in my opinion, and if it had been a biological child, there would've been no \"returning them.\" I wish you had given her another chance and shown her what forgiveness looks like, what commitment to healing and repair looks like. These are not easy cases and I hope in the future you consider whether you're ready to be committed to these kids.", "YTA. Your attitude of \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019d harm our daughter\u201d and calling it \u201cabuse\u201d is really crappy. I don\u2019t think a 14 year old with drug issues is intentionally targeting your kid, she\u2019s clearly trying to numb herself. I highly doubt she thought of it as harming your daughter, especially since you said she liked her. This isn\u2019t an adult with a fully formed brain, this is a very damaged child. SHE is the one who has likely experienced a bunch of abuse. All 14 year olds do stupid things, and it should have been expected that a child with drug problems would attempt to use drugs if she found them. You both should have known better and kept ALL medications locked up. I get how irritating this situation is, but ultimately you were irresponsible and clearly didn\u2019t thoroughly think through and plan adequately to foster a child, particularly a troubled child.", "[deleted]", "YTA for taking in a child you weren\u2019t prepared for and then bailing.

Please don't take in any more foster kids, you are plainly unable to provide that level of care. Consider pursuing therapy and further education to prepare you for offering respite care rather than long term placements if you absolutely have to be involved. And bear in mind accepting kids undergoing extremely stressful circumstances is ALWAYS going to have an impact on your daughter and it will rarely be under your complete control.", "YTA.\n\nClearly intervention is needed, but you committed to caring for a child that clearly has issues. This is pretty typical of a kid in this situation and while it\u2019s not ok, kicking her out seems pretty compassionless and nuclear.

So IMO foster kid's behaviour seems like a clear sign of possible impulse control issues around getting high. \n\nI think I'm gonna go with ESH. Foster kid's sucking is obvious. You kinda suck for not understanding/properly researching what a 14 year old who has a drug issue (even just weed) would need for care before and while fostering them and then kicking her out for the cough meds (which were only even accessible due to your oversight) immediately without calming down to think it through when she predictably stole meds that can possibly get you high. Fostering a troubled kid is a **big commitment** and it doesn't really seem like you took it seriously enough before jumping in. I do get that you wanted to help foster kid and while kind of you to do so, the net effect here is very likely to be that you made things harder for her and hurt her worse then if you'd done nothing for her.  \n\nSide note: Really hope your kid is ok and fully recovers from covid.\n\nEdit - Got more context from comments, changed my vote slightly and removed some criticism of OP.", "I want to say NTA but you guys really weren't prepared to foster and it impacted the life of this teenager. It really is shitty for them to get bounced around and it will make connecting with the new family (and people in general) even harder that they got kicked out.

Sure it was shitty to steal but these are traumatized kids who need trauma informed foster parents. So almost NTA. Don't foster again.", "YTA, \n\nDo not foster any children ever again. You already have biological child that requires extra attention. What you did was overreaction and disgusting. You failed this child and you should feel guilty because you should have never be considered a foster parent. You decided to give back a child when it got hard for you.

She needs therapy and counselling more than anything. You should have thought about that before adopting her and pulled out before adopting her.

Throwing her back into the foster system is doing more damage than good and it's likely she won't ever get the help she needs because no one wants to adopt a 14 year old that's addicted onto drugs and has behavioural issues.

I hope you think long and hard about your reaction here and how you will actually parent your child when they inevitably become their own independent person capable of making dangerous choices themselves without thinking about the consequences.", "YTA. L. What\u2019s wrong with you?\n  \n> Once you take from my kid, there is no coming back from that. \n  \nThere\u2019s the problem or a lot of it right there. **You don\u2019t consider your foster daughter your actual child!** I\u2019m betting she\u2019s the second place child in everything.\n  \n>  The fact that she lived across the hall from my daughter and listened to her coughing all day and night and still had the lack of humanity that she felt ok taking her medicine is sickening and represents a depravity I was not prepared for\n  \nIt\u2019s not \u201cdepravity\u201d. She stole some prescription meds like teenagers do sometimes. Your other daughter is fine. You should be talking it out and making amends with your foster daughter but you *threw her away*!\n  \n> Lastly, we are not foster parents. We did this for a child my wife knew. We were not looking to foster any other kids, we were just trying to help one. We were not prepared for this and are going to focus on our own daughter now.\n  \nYou became foster parents the second you took her in that door. **You just threw her back into the system of a small mistake. No wonder she\u2019s doing more and more drugs around YOU.**\n  \n**From your own words you\u2019ve never cared about this girl and treat her as an annoyance. Not a child who needs love and is supposed to be as much of your kid as your bio daughter. **\n  \n\n**You again threw her away and just damaged her further for life!**", "IDK. hard to say. maybe NTA. being teenage means, the brain areas for empathy degenerate and then rebuild. so you cant make a teen responsible for lack of empathy, bc at times they are much less capable of it. i think this could have been a good parenting chance, and bonding over it. now you feel bad, she feels bad. but the question is, could it have worked out, would more time have made the deal? i guess we just never know.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou seem to not view the foster as your own child or as part of the family. Kids can sense that. That might be causing her to act out.. \n\nSo\u2026. The foster stole children cough medicine that you can get over the counter for <$20, not expensive prescription medicine (Ex:  controlled substance prescriptions). So yes, Kicking her out seems like a bit harsh. You knew she had a drug addiction from the start\u2026. You should have had all medicines locked up. As someone whose friend was introduced to drugs at age 10, you\u2019re lucky it\u2019s just weed and cough syrup, there\u2019s way worse out there. \n\nThe foster child doesn\u2019t respect you, that\u2019s clear. And the foster won\u2019t because tbh, It appears you are terrible at disciplining your foster kid. Teens will challenge your authority if you let them. Ex: you told the foster not to do weed, but did you actually punish her when she did? Also, did you seek out any rehab or drug addiction centers for kids? If not, then \u201cgetting rid of the foster\u201d (your words) was an overstep when you haven\u2019t tried everything to resolve the addiction the foster child had. \n\nBut if it was genuinely too much to handle, then okay fine. Just remember, this is a foster CHILD. If there is no positive role model to show the foster a better life away from drugs and forgive her for mistakes made along getting her journey of getting clean, she will spiral. Giving her up like that is likely to have make her drug addiction worse. Quitting is not easy.  \n\nI would have agreed with giving her up if she wasn\u2019t willing to go to rehab. But you didn\u2019t even ask so\u2026.", "NTA and glad you are not signed up as foster parents or my judgement would differ", "Don't bring trash inside your home.

We were made aware of one marijuana incident prior to her moving in. I had smoked weed as a 14 yr old too and thought I could handle that (which we were doing). I was totally unprepared for her level of drug abuse. If I had known, I likely would not have taken her in. We are not going to foster anymore as we feel like we got in over our heads. I never thought it would be easy, but I didn\u2019t consider it would be dangerous. That\u2019s my fault and part of why I feel guilty.", "I have to agree. Being a foster parent is hard and the kids coming in have a high chance of behavioral problems stemming from past abuse or unhealthy coping mechanisms to deal with a rough childhood. Foster parents should be aware of this, and willing to deal with these problems by getting the child the help they need. If this is not within OPs capacity because their hands are full with their other children, then it is **OPs responsibility to recognize the limitations of care they can provide.** This child is not a bad person, no one is inherently a bad person, just people who act in certain ways because of their past and the environment they grew up in. People are capable of change.", "My wife asked me this and it is an excellent question. I feel my biological child would have more shared values and not do something like this to her sister, but even if they did, I think I would have sent her away.

There\u2019s so much disregard for this child, she\u2019s clearly going through the ringer and gets tossed to the curb again?

I've been told minor depression (understandable) and found out there were previous diagnoses of ODD, bipolar and even a history of suicide attempts and extended hospitalizations. \n\nI know how hard it is to place teenagers, but DCFS isn't helping anyone by hiding information.

I will say, most people suggest you don\u2019t foster a child older than any biological kids you may have, but you rolled the dice trying to save a life and it didn\u2019t work. The system is set up to fail the kids. \n\nPlease don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. I have some absolute horror stories of what I did in foster care. When I graduated college I mailed a picture to all of the families (whose addresses I could find) to both apologize and thank them. \n\nI hope you can get a letter like that, it sounds like you really tried to open your heart to this young person.
