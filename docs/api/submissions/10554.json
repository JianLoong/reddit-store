It's not the same system in the US and you've both made different choices. Your sister made the choice to stay and provide for herself, not expect handouts.", "NTA. Ahhhh the power of socialized Healthcare. On a similar note, you DID have to pay. Just through taxes and at a significantly reduced rate. You don't owe her anything.\n\nI do agree that SOMETHING is unfair, but it's the American Healthcare system and not you.", "NTA. I am amazed you received pelvic floor rehab. Sounds like you made a great choice.", "NTA  \n\n\n\"sorry sis ... you know, those crazy socialist taxes, we're broke.  can't help you.  \ncome visit sometime.\n\nbye - talk to you next xmas\"", "NTA", "NTA. Like, oh no, the toxic person is going NC,  big scare!  LOL", "NTA.  The medical care isn't free, it is paid for by taxes and even if it wasn't, you don't owe your sister anything.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is the AH. I can't believe she asked you to pay her bills, especially after insulting your choices and your husband. In fact, it was more of a demand. Let her go NC. You're better off.", "NTA.  And for all of them thinking you didn\u2019t pay anything, I\u2019m sorry but you did.  It\u2019s called taxes. That is how things like healthcare is paid for.  You might actually have a higher tax rate or withholdings then your family does in the US.  There is also the fact that there maybe laws in place to regulate and control healthcare cost in France compared to the US.  \n\nI\u2019m in Japan and and have a simple health care situation as France.  Cost is lower but we do pay a fair amount of taxes for the privilege.  We all pay for the privilege of healthcare wether it it\u2019s before or after.\n\nThe biggest difference probably is the control over pricing in the healthcare industry.", "NTA. No contact Sounds like a win-Win to me!", "Now she knows why some people in US can't stand the Healthcare system. NTA.", "Why should you pay for your sister's medical bill just because you live where your similar medical care is free to everyone?\n\nNTA", "What is this \u201cAmerica bad\u201d nonsense?", "NTA.  But I'll note that I'm in the States and have good health insurance, and all of my prenatal appointments and the childbirth itself (in hospital) were also fully covered.  It's possible even here.", "At least if she goes NC then she won\u2019t be begging for money win-win \nNTA", "There\u2019s a video somewhere of someone asking people on the street in the uk how much they think it costs to have a baby in uk \n\nFor me the money is crazy! I don\u2019t understand how Americans do it, but just because it\u2019s free for me to have a child doesn\u2019t mean I have spare money?! NTA children are still expensive without the medical bills side of it", "I was thinking the same thing... and not only hospital bills but EVERYTHING", "And socialized \u201ccare\u201d too \u2014 sister has it better so she demands sister\u2019s stuff.", "Yeah, but she has 2 other children.", "Not just taxes but also *cotisations* and then there's the monthly *mutuelle* payment which is for the top-up insurance for the part that isn't reimbursed by the government.", ">capitalize on your \"communist\" lifestyle \n\ngot to love capitalism", "but socialism and communism= free /s", "As someone who was born and raised in the US, it's straight up propaganda and brainwashing.", "There are a lot of lobbyists representing the companies that make tons of money off this system who help make sure the propaganda continues. And then those companies donate to politicians to keep it up.", "Its system is not even pure socialism. But try explaining the difference between socialism and socialist democracy to someone who believes that the US is the only free country in the world.", "The country itself is very beautiful, but the lifestyle is what drew me in. Like I would dread being a mother in the US, it seems like your identity gets erased. Here? You can be a woman who happens to be a mother, and no one would shame you for it.", ">I\u2019m assuming she also wasn\u2019t expecting to have to pay you back.\n\nI mean she just outright came out and said that since OP didn't have to pay for her pregnancy she should help pay for her 20k costs. From that it doesnt look like she wanted to pay anyone back just some good old conservative charity", "This is \"real America\", if it happens to be bad, it's not my fault. All I did was state the difference in cost.", "Reading through the comments, I discovered that in the US, to get the same care we do here for approximately the same price, you have to pay really high for a good health care plan.\n\nFrance has a lot of problems, I won't deny that, but at least here the same care is accorded to everyone, not only those who can afford to drop a lot of money on a good plan.", "People who live in countries with socialized medicine pay higher taxes in order to cover the costs of their health care systems. So yeah, just because you (like OP) don't have to bankrupt yourself in order to give birth doesn't mean you have $20k lying around to distribute to deprived Americans. OP's sister is awful.", "I know I\u2019m like, oh please leave the politics at home. Lord knows it\u2019s a divisive subject.", "Thanks! I'm a Canuck too and hate the argument that we don't pay. It's not free...sheesh", "I'll take it - first kid was an emergency c-section and 9 days in NICU. My hospital bill was $0...rather than what $50k or more in the US?", "Sure...but you can still use it as an example", "Trouble is a lot of people don\u2019t want to do anything that benefits someone making less than they are. It\u2019s pure greed.", "Of course, but that's besides the point. The point is it wasn't OP's decision for the sister to give birth to three children in a country where the sister KNEW it was expensive. The sister could have looked into alternatives, as was fully aware of the cost of doing so in the USA, but she didn't. It's not unfair. If it makes you feel better, imagine I said \"She could have chosen to give birth in France, too\" and the point still stands.", "Lol, this is what we say all the time.  They needed a different name for it.", "How old are your parents and from where in the states if you dont mind me asking? \n\nIm just imagining a 50-60s midwestern couple sitting in an uber just saying all of this.", "That\u2019s pretty funny, but I too was wondering if she was passive aggressive. Nope, just impressed.", "F\u00e9licitations!\n\nJust wait until she finds out about the subsidised *cr\u00eaches* and *halte-garderies* and that kids can start *maternelle* from 2 or 3, part-time, with subsidised afterschool care.\n\nThen there's the 'allocations familiales and PAJE' which is child benefits paid to most families with children, plus the 'allocation rentr\u00e9e scolaire' which is a one-off payment in August for school supplies.\n\nFrance supports its families and there's a lot more support again that I haven't mentioned for low income families, like mine :-)", "Oh, it's a better system almost anywhere else, no doubts there.  I work for a university and I guess we just get pretty good coverage, which is nice.  I don't think it's overly high priced.  I had my kid unmedicated and although it took a while, I didn't have any complications, so it's possible that there would have been some costs, I don't actually know and I'm absolutely never doing that again, so I'm happy to not find out.  Congratulations on your baby!", "Insurance doesn\u2019t make much of a difference unfortunately. I have pretty decent coverage through work and I just had a baby. The total costs were over 20k, insurance paid about 12k of it. I was stuck with the rest out of pocket. \nThe hospital charged me 15K alone for my labor and delivery room, which I was in from 8am until 9pm on one day. My labor was fast, there were no complications and it was very easy. The pediatrician in the hospital who comes to check on the newborn once after delivery and once before discharge was $700 for each visit and they were with my baby for less than 5 minutes. \nWe went into the hospital at 8am on Monday morning and were discharged at 8pm Tuesday night. Still 20K.", "Oh geez, I misread and thought it was 350,000. Good thing I have an eye appointment in March - lol.\nI had an ambulance ride less than 10 miles with no meds or anything and it was over $1000.", "ETA:  oops, sounds like I\u2019m condemning the OP, I mean US medical system.  I have good insurance and happy for it, but our younger generation is being screwed.", "In their 60s and from MO.", "First, I am not that knowledgeable about US health insurance, since I never had to deal with it.\n\nSecond, that figure and their situation is what she told me, if it's made up, it wasn't me who made it up.", "It can make a big difference, unfortunately.  I have really good insurance through my job, with a max out of pocket of $150 per year.  Went through cancer treatment last year and paid $150 out of the several hundred thousand my insurance covered.  Radiation alone was ~$7k per 15min session, which I did 5 days a week for 5 weeks (~175k).  \n\nOur system is incredibly fucked.", "That's just nuts. I've always carried the best insurance I could buy. I had enough dealing with the military medical. I could have gone cheaper but worried about big out of pocket. It paid off with my husband.  It was 25000.00 for just the life flight for him. I didn't pay anything on that.", "Yep.  Husband was out of network for surgery and we kicked out doctors wrote off $20,000 that wasn\u2019t covered.\nDoesn\u2019t happen often in US, we were stunned.", "Unfortunately the best insurance my company offers is almost my entire paycheck just for coverage on me, not even my family. It sucks, but insurance is stupid anyways. I\u2019d rather keep my entire check and just pay reasonable prices for services as I need them, but the existence of insurance companies allows hospitals to charge 15K for a 13 hour hospital stay.", "I (Canadian) remember talking to a guy and his wife from Utah once in Cancun. As things go people from different countries talk about the differences. At one point it came up that literally 50% of his every pay cheque (he was a military aircraft mechanic) went to paying for their healthcare plan. I was dumbfounded. And even then he said if they ever had to go to hospital or the doctor they'd still be paying something.\n\nAnd ya in Canada it's a percentage of your taxes from your paycheque graded against how much you make that get taken off...but to me, I don't even notice and personally I think that's better than a \"SURPRISE!\" 25 thousand dollar bill.", "Yes, my daughter went through that. To cover her baby, it would take 3 of her paychecks. It was crazy. We helped her the 1st year cover costs because she made 10.00 to much a month to get state help for the baby. 2nd year, she qualified for medical coverage for her daughter."]}
