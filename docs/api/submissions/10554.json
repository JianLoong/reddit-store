To be honest, she sounds a bit jealous that you got to have a different quality of life where you don't have to struggle to pay for medical care or worry about it at all.\n\nIf you want to, you could think about putting a couple grand in a high interest savings account for her new child, leaving it for 18 years, then sending the money to the child for college.", "The nerve of you moving to a country that believes everyone should have medical care and shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being burdened by debt from them!

That part doesn't sound all that innocent to me.", "Definitely NTA - at the end of the day as an American myself, you have to be responsible and do your due diligence. Part of that involves reflecting on whether or not you can afford something; that car, those hobby items, that child in this case...   \n\n\nShe made the choice and ultimately the consequences are hers to bear alone.

I have pretty cheap insurance by US standards that costs only ~$120/month (to me, my employer pays a bunch more). It took a physical visit to the allergist and a video call to get the first part of it done. I paid $20 out of pocket for those visits ($10 each). I also paid ~$90 out of pocket for the blood tests to determine my allergy issues. So, not so bad for me.\n\nBut WAIT! What did these providers actually bill?

For my one hour video follow up to go over my allergy test results, my insurance was billed $315. So full board that's $2570.05 for a history and basic intake appointment with an allergist, blood tests to check for some allergies (not all! they didn't run a full panel, just a limited one to check for certain suspected things), and a video call to follow up on the results for those blood tests.\n\nThe board-certified allergist I am seeing probably deserves to get around $300 an hour (there are nurses and desk staff and office space and equipment and etc. paid out of that rate, too! And my insurance does appear to pay about $250/hour for those services based on my documents). But the lab charges are just insane! Looking at the breakdown, it was barely $25 to have my blood drawn, but over a thousand dollars to run a common allergy panel.
