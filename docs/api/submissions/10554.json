Then I decided to go to college here, met my husband and just moved here permanently.\n\nMy sister hated the fact that I left the US.

My mom was very impressed by the fact that we paid nothing to have this baby. I didn't have to pay for my check ups, my mandatory lab work, the birth itself, the hospital stay and some post natal care that includes pelvic floor rehab. I didn't even have to pay for a preventative dentist appointment. Apparently the same thing in the US would cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nAnyways, they left directly to my sister's, she needed help (had some health scare) and they planned to stay with her untill she gave birth, and then for a while after to help with the kids.\n\nI called to congratulate her when she gave birth, sent a gift and all that. She was pissy even then.\n\nThen yesterday she called me, told me that her hospital bills were over $20k because of some complications, and that it wasn't fair that I didn't pay anything at all (apparently my mom kept bringing up the fact that it was free for me). She said since I didn't have to spend a cent, then I can afford to help her, so she too can afford to stay with her kid, instead of going back to work ASAP.\n\nHere's where I might he the AH, even though I could afford to send her a couple thousands, I refused to do so purely because of how much she looked down on my decision to to move to France and marry a french man. So all I told her is \"Sorry I can't help you. But you are free to come give birth to your next child here. Even as a foreigner it won't cost you more than 3k\"\n\nShe called me a condescending AH and said she will be going NC with me.

NTA.", "NTA \n\nIf your sister is so intent on shitting on the notion of socialised healthcare, she'll be glad to continue to navigate the US system she knows and loves. You're under no obligation to help her, and since she already thinks so poorly of you and your choices, it'll be no great shakes to ignore her.\n\nI don't know why she thinks she's entitled to benefit from you living in a country where healthcare is free, especially since she's gone out of her way to let you know what she thinks of said country and your decision to reside there. To be honest, she sounds a bit jealous that you got to have a different quality of life where you don't have to struggle to pay for medical care or worry about it at all.\n\nIf you want to, you could think about putting a couple grand in a high interest savings account for her new child, leaving it for 18 years, then sending the money to the child for college.", "The nerve of you moving to a country that believes everyone should have medical care and shouldn\u2019t have to worry about being burdened by debt from them!

If she chooses to go NC because you won't give her money, I think you should let her.", "NTA. \n\n\nYour sisters reproductive decisions are not your financial responsibility. If you had another sibling who wasn't able to have children, would your sister be demanding they pay because it's \"not fair\" that they didn't have to pay for the children they couldn't have? \n\n\nThe fact you didn't have to pay is not unfair. She could have chosen to move to France too, she just didn't. \n\n\nAnd not only that, but she even went to the point of actively slating your decision and the country you moved to. She doesn't deserve to reap any \"rewards\" from your decision to move to France, she wouldn't anyway, but especially not considering her attitude towards your decision!!! \n\n\nAlso how can she threaten you with going no contact when it's thanks to her that you went low contact in the first place? She basically bullied you into going low contact, and now that she's trying to use you to her financial gain and might not get her way in a situation that only benefits HER she's threatening that SHE'LL go no contact?

Her reasoning that it was free so you should give her your money so she can stay at hone and not go back to work? Insane.", "NTA. She is the AH for not supporting your move to France, and just straight-up talking down about it whenever she gets the chance. And then she seriously expects *you* to pay? Honestly... I smell a hint of jealousy.", "NTA - also her argument is wrong. You DO pay for health care. It's in your taxes. Healthcare isn't free, it's just funded differently. For example (quick google), if you earn 28,000 Euros in France your tax rate is 31.8% but in the US it would be 20.3% and the top tax rate is like 25 basis point higher (59.4% vs 34.2%). \n\nBut that's beside the point...", "Info: how was your relationship before you moved to France? \n\nUltimately NTA. Whether it\u2019s jealousy or insecurity whatever the reason she can\u2019t trash talk you then demand money", "NTA. She sounds like she's burning with jealousy and has been for years.

I think you're getting a good deal by her going NC, though I'm sorry she's so awful.", "NTA.\n\nWelcome to the EU", "It's not for free, we pay much higher taxes here in Europe. You just prepaid your care.\n\nAnd of course it's totally worth it. I do not get why people in the US support all this.", "NTA. If she goes NC because you won't give her money, then there was no relationship there to begin with.\n\nDo your parents have a history of provoking fights between you two? That part doesn't sound all that innocent to me.", "Definitely NTA - at the end of the day as an American myself, you have to be responsible and do your due diligence. Part of that involves reflecting on whether or not you can afford something; that car, those hobby items, that child in this case...   \n\n\nShe made the choice and ultimately the consequences are hers to bear alone. She's not entitled to your money or any benefits she put down. She's just trying to take advantage to me.", "NTA. But please be smart and just cut contact. Your sister sounds entitled and insufferable.", "But wait, she hates \"communism and socialism\", so why on Earth would she be upset that you benefited from a country with a system that actually gives their taxpayers services that benefit their lives?\n\nYou are under no obligation to help someone who has been nothing but snarky and unsupportive of your life choices. Tell her she now has to live with the consequences of her own.\n\nNTA", "NAH.  Not your problem.  Too bad she said she was cutting you off versus the other way around as she shouldn\u2019t even get that satisfaction lol.  \n\nPlus this is your sister\u2019s third kid, so it\u2019s not like she doesn\u2019t know how the insurance system works here and her likely costs.  She can work with the hospital and her insurance company and file appeals, but that\u2019s not on you to tell her that. \n\nOh well, c\u2019est la vie! Congrats on your baby!", "INFO: is your sister uninsured?", "Forget her.
