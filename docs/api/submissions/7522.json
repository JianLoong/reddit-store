My fiance has no biological children but he's great with my boys. There HAS been discussion of having a baby together in the past but it was something we were always on the fence about because my youngest has some behavioral issues that exhausts us most days. So it was kind of a \"no, definitely no more babies\" one minute and then \"if it happens, it happens\" the next minute. \n\nI'm on birth control. Or I was, up until last week when I found out I'm pregnant. I never failed to take it on time. I had an alarm set for every single night at 8pm and took it religiously for the past 4 years! Maybe it was the antibiotics I was on last month BUT I made sure to wait a week after taking the antibiotics to even do.. you know.. so I thought I was safe but regardless, here we are. Completely unexpected. \n\nWell, my fiance is much more calm about this than I am. I'm scared shitless. I mean, I'm happy but terrified and holy hell my emotions have been a rollercoaster ride in itself. I'm very quick to sadden and anger now and I can't even stand myself. So please, tell me if I'm overreacting with this comment.. we were talking about the kids, including new baby, and he just went real quiet for awhile and when he finally spoke again he goes \"I'm going to end up treating them different\". I asked what he meant and he goes \"well I love the boys but like.. they're not mine. It's not going to be the same and I'm going to love my child much more.\" I immediately got up and left. It was a smack in the face. My boys real father passed before I met my fiance in a horrific accident. My boys call my fiance dad for crying out loud and have since forever (they were only 2 and 1 when he met them). So I left to get space because that comment hurt so much and raised questions because if he starts treating them all different simply because he now has a blood child, I simply can't put my boys through it.

He is obviously concerned about it though, or he wouldn't have shared that with you. If he keeps it in mind, then he should be able to stop it if he catches himself treating them differently. You should give him a chance, but remind him that you will love all of the kids the same and won't tolerate anything else, and that your boys love him no less than their biological father and deserve no less of his love. Also, they are going to be big brothers and love their youngest siblings, they won't differentiate because they don't share a bio dad, and neither should anyone else. It's good that you've reacted as you have because it shows how outrageous it is in your eyes.

What he said is probably true, but it didn\u2019t need to be said, especially if he\u2019s been a father to your boys since they were toddlers.

I don't understand how so many people can find this normal and natural. Some people are capable of loving an adopted kid equally to a bio kid, some aren't. Fine. But this is something to think about BEFORE you plan your family together. If you aren't the type of person who can love all your children equally, you have no business having children in the first place because you're going to be a bad parent to them.

It depends on how he said it. I can see how POSSIBLY he is worried about his natural instincts kicking it with it being his blood child. More protective possibly or picking sides. Maybe he is trying to open a dialogue with you to talk through it. Maybe he thought it and should have just kept his mouth shut. Maybe he said it in a matter of fact way that was just too harsh. I\u2019d speak with him further about it. Maybe nothing comes from the discussion or maybe you can remind him how they feel about him and how treating them differently will only cause harm and resentment down the line, which I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want. \n\nAgain, I think his delivery is important in figuring out the intent. Good luck. \ud83c\udf40 I think this is savable.", "NTA. It's ok to need space when people make hurtful comments and for him to say you're overreacting is dismissive of your feelings.", "NTA. I\u2019m tired of people pretending that it\u2019s okay for people to treat stepkids differently, particularly if said stepkids have grown up acknowledging step-parent as mom or dad. That\u2019s fucked up. Full stop. That\u2019s not right.\n\nI hope to god this comment section has some sense, but I have a feeling people are going to say YTA simply because you want your children to all be loved equally by your partner, who is acknowledged by your children as *dad*. Usually how this sub goes is if they\u2019re not blood, it\u2019s okay to treat them like they\u2019re less than. Fucking christ.", "NTA I wouldn't be having a kid with him. Point stop. It's not fair to you, your current kids, or a new baby.", "Seems like couples counseling would do you both some good.

Anyways, although, he is really smart, he did have behavior issues as a teen, and my dad at times has treated him a bit different. We (other siblings) were told much later that he wasn't my dad's bio kid, but we never cared about that. However, because at times as an adult he has behaved badly and given in to his AH wife, my dad has been, let's say, cold, even to his daughters. He DOES love my brother and has stated so, but given my brother's behavior, he's just cautious.

You do need to talk this through however with your fianc\u00e9 and get things straight about what he meant. Jumping to conclusions like people in the comments here are doing isn't helping either way.

She was great when it was just me and my older sister but when her and my father had my half brother, my sister and I were thrown to the side. When asked why, my stepmother said that we were not her true kids and that she wanted a child that was really hers. Needless to say, we don\u2019t speak much now.

You might still give a hug and some physical comfort occasionally but not usually quite as often as the bio parent might bc they have already been doing it for years. And an adult walking in and doing that could be kinda creepy let\u2019s be honest. So the relationship formed is different. People are very quick to judge step parents and \u201csay treat them as your own\u201d without even thinking of the complexities and dynamics that are at play.

He is loving them and raising them and caring but then but also navigating being fair to their relationship with their lost dad and those memories. That\u2019s a line he won\u2019t have to walk or consider with his bio child. It\u2019s not less love, it\u2019s respect.

And her. It\u2019s a lot to throw away without fighting for it", "Nothing you said makes sense to me \n\nAnd I don\u2019t care if people disagree with me. I\u2019m nit the one flipping out bc people have different opinions than me. I don\u2019t know why people can\u2019t just accept that. They always need to try to prove then wrong or change their mind. It\u2019s an opinion people. Chill out. It doesn\u2019t matter", "It seems like u/wun_and_dun is seeing this comment from fianc\u00e9 as an expression of his fears, not an announcement of his intentions.", "People need to feel validated. His fear is totally normal. He also probably feels awful about the thought and wants to be reassured", "Ok, so unplanned, life-changing events can cause an emotional response in humans called anxiety.   \n\nAnxiety is an emotion which is characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events.   \n\nOne way that humans deal with anxiety is to discuss some of those anticipated events causing the feelings of dread with trusted loved ones that they consider sources of emotional support.  \n\nIn those situations, these loved ones can help alleviate the negative emotions by providing reassurance, love, and support to the person experiencing them.  \n\nAdditionally, feelings of dread regarding anticipated events can be lessened by hearing outside reassurance that the anticipated event is unlikely to occur, and that the listening person will help ensure that it doesn\u2019t.  \n\nI hope this clears up some of the confusion you are experiencing about the concepts of anxiety and emotional support.", "How dare someone need help when struggling with their emotions. Men just need to suck it up and handle it themselves, yeah?", "Ok, so unplanned, life-changing events can cause an emotional response in humans called anxiety.\n\nAnxiety is an emotion which is characterized by an unpleasant state of inner turmoil and includes feelings of dread over anticipated events.\n\nOne way that humans deal with anxiety is to discuss some of those anticipated events causing the feelings of dread with trusted loved ones that they consider sources of emotional support.\n\nIn those situations, these loved ones can help alleviate the negative emotions by providing reassurance, love, and support to the person experiencing them.\n\nAdditionally, feelings of dread regarding anticipated events can be lessened by hearing outside reassurance that the anticipated event is unlikely to occur, and that the listening person will help ensure that it doesn\u2019t.\n\nI hope this clears up some of the confusion you are experiencing about the concepts of anxiety and emotional support.", "Now that would be fucked. Yikes. Idk dude I can't comprehend ever loving a stepkid as much as a biological kid but at least as far as this sub goes I guess I'm in the minority there. He has seemingly been very Involved with the kids so it is a strange turn of events, but people do commit to things and later get overwhelmed and backtrack. Not saying that it's alright but it happens", "I think it was a bad thing to say but I kinda agree that he has a right to discuss that with his spouse. Obviously OP is NTA for how she reacted, but he's probably very overwhelmed, and maybe a discussion about this issue is better than him bottling up those feelings and not telling anyone.", "Still worth a discussion. If it were me, I\u2019d rather that be said out loud so we can move forward with it out in the open. Communication is key and this couple needs a serious conversation ASAP. We don\u2019t always have it together and emotions can get the best of us - especially at times of big (unexpected) change. I don\u2019t think we need to hold it against our spouse for saying something worrisome or nasty one time (if this is repeat behaviour from this guy then that\u2019s a different story).", "I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good thing at all but he could overall be a good father to them. Be everything he has been to them this whole time and still have a slightly different feeling towards his blood child. This isn\u2019t impossible and I\u2019m sure it happens regularly.  Does that make him a bath father. Do you throw the whole father away? Is he still alllll those things? If he isn\u2019t treating them completely different like a Cinderella situation, I could see him being a good father still as he apparently has been for some time now.  Did he say he would be less of a father to them? Not so much. \n\nAgain, not saying this is ok, just saying it\u2019s potentially nuanced and only OP knows what he is.", "why don't you go and tell us what happens to a kid of a divorced couple, when one of the parents has not re-married and whose second spouse hasn't adopted the children... and that parent dies. \n\nstill think we treat nominal step children the same as biological children?", "Yeah, that\u2019s the main topic we\u2019re talking about. Punctuation.", "Oh I'm not worried Abt internet points it's just that this sub is mostly thought experiments and reactions, so it's weird to see basically a disagree button without seeing why. But yeah. Super tough spot, especially coming to this crossroads during a pregnancy. Sheesh.", "i'm agreeing with you, mope. \n\nif this was a story about a woman with no biological kids asking if she was the asshole for proclaiming to her fiance that she was happy she was going to have one despite caring for his kids/her stepkids, there's no doubt that everyone would be on her side", "There is absolutely nothing in OP's comment that indicates he feels awful or worried about it though. Fianc\u00e9 gave no indication that he has thought about how this will impact the boys or that he could make an effort to ensure they still feel loved and appreciated when the new baby comes along. That's the disturbing part of this for me. It doesn't come across as an expression of fear on his part, it comes across as a realization that now he's found his \"real\" kid. If he said anything at all to reassure OP or treat it like an issue to address instead of a natural fact, it would be far less worrisome", "Why is it so important for his fear to be validated and not OPs fear of her kids having a distant stepfather?", "And that\u2019s why you\u2019re smart and don\u2019t date people with kids \ud83e\udd23 unlike this guy who suddenly got surprised after not only dating, but proposing to a woman with two kids who call him dad. Talk about a reality check.", "So you changed your original statement from treat to feel. Of course you can absolutely feel differently about your\u201dblood\u201d but still be a great father to all. I just don\u2019t think that those feelings can lead to different treatment of your children and you still be a great parent. That\u2019s just me.", "There are so many people here who talk about going LC or NC with a birth parent bc their birth parent married someone who treated them differently from bio kids. There can be a range but without knowing, there can be drastic differences.\n\nWhen my cousin was 12 she came to live with us and my parents treated her, my brother and I exactly the same(well a little different because she came to live with us from very hard circumstances) and even now they treat the three of us very equally(and her bio parents are in her life). Someone not knowing us would have no idea.\n\nPeople raise other peoples children all the time and treat them with the same care and love that they treat their own children. \n\nPeople who don\u2019t do this though, it\u2019s not a little bit, it\u2019s usually very noticeable and hurtful and kids and teens can absolutely tell and feel it. \n\nHer first priority should be as their mom protecting them and if he truly does intend to treat them differently then she has to protect them from that.", "Maybe because he brought it up first, and her fear is in response to his?  If they can address his fear compassionately, then hers might resolve on its own.  If not, they can then move on to hers.  It's not either/or.", "Ok\u2026. Feeling/treatment. Either way. I can see it being nuanced. She knows him and his intent and who he has been up to now.", "I don\u2019t disagree with the possibility, simply would warrant further discussion.", "Nowhere has he stated it is a fear, everything OP says points to him just stating a fact. Everything about it being a fear coming from him are just assumptions made in the comments. Usually people just say what they mean.", "He wasn\u2019t expressing fears. He made a declaration that he would love his biological child more. He\u2019s allowed to have fears. He should also have some sense when expressing something like that to his now pregnant fianc\u00e9.", "Yes, and she was concerned about his statement because it was counter to who he has been to her children. She probably doesn\u2019t want to just brush it off and then he does exactly what he said that he would do to a noticeable degree and her other kids suffer for it.", "Yes, I agree more discussion was needed. It didn\u2019t sound like they had really talked it through at all.\n\nI was responding to your saying if he treats them differently it might be okay, and that\u2019s the part I vehemently disagree with. I\u2019ve witnessed the hurt kids feel when they are treated differently and this is their only home and the only person they know as dad.", "Why are you arguing with me? She asked for opinions so I gave mine. I\u2019m not here to be convinced. You are talking to the wrong one."]}
