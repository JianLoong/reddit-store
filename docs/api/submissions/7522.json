My fiance has no biological children but he's great with my boys. There HAS been discussion of having a baby together in the past but it was something we were always on the fence about because my youngest has some behavioral issues that exhausts us most days. So it was kind of a \"no, definitely no more babies\" one minute and then \"if it happens, it happens\" the next minute. \n\nI'm on birth control. Or I was, up until last week when I found out I'm pregnant. I never failed to take it on time. I had an alarm set for every single night at 8pm and took it religiously for the past 4 years! Maybe it was the antibiotics I was on last month BUT I made sure to wait a week after taking the antibiotics to even do.. you know.. so I thought I was safe but regardless, here we are. Completely unexpected. \n\nWell, my fiance is much more calm about this than I am. I'm scared shitless. I mean, I'm happy but terrified and holy hell my emotions have been a rollercoaster ride in itself. I'm very quick to sadden and anger now and I can't even stand myself. So please, tell me if I'm overreacting with this comment.. we were talking about the kids, including new baby, and he just went real quiet for awhile and when he finally spoke again he goes \"I'm going to end up treating them different\". I asked what he meant and he goes \"well I love the boys but like.. they're not mine. It's not going to be the same and I'm going to love my child much more.\" I immediately got up and left. It was a smack in the face. My boys real father passed before I met my fiance in a horrific accident. My boys call my fiance dad for crying out loud and have since forever (they were only 2 and 1 when he met them). So I left to get space because that comment hurt so much and raised questions because if he starts treating them all different simply because he now has a blood child, I simply can't put my boys through it.

You should give him a chance, but remind him that you will love all of the kids the same and won't tolerate anything else, and that your boys love him no less than their biological father and deserve no less of his love. Also, they are going to be big brothers and love their youngest siblings, they won't differentiate because they don't share a bio dad, and neither should anyone else. It's good that you've reacted as you have because it shows how outrageous it is in your eyes.

What he said is probably true, but it didn\u2019t need to be said, especially if he\u2019s been a father to your boys since they were toddlers.

I don't understand how so many people can find this normal and natural. Some people are capable of loving an adopted kid equally to a bio kid, some aren't. Fine. But this is something to think about BEFORE you plan your family together. If you aren't the type of person who can love all your children equally, you have no business having children in the first place because you're going to be a bad parent to them.

It depends on how he said it. I can see how POSSIBLY he is worried about his natural instincts kicking it with it being his blood child. More protective possibly or picking sides. Maybe he is trying to open a dialogue with you to talk through it. Maybe he thought it and should have just kept his mouth shut. Maybe he said it in a matter of fact way that was just too harsh. I\u2019d speak with him further about it. Maybe nothing comes from the discussion or maybe you can remind him how they feel about him and how treating them differently will only cause harm and resentment down the line, which I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t want. \n\nAgain, I think his delivery is important in figuring out the intent. Good luck. \ud83c\udf40 I think this is savable.", "NTA. It's ok to need space when people make hurtful comments and for him to say you're overreacting is dismissive of your feelings.", "NTA. I\u2019m tired of people pretending that it\u2019s okay for people to treat stepkids differently, particularly if said stepkids have grown up acknowledging step-parent as mom or dad. That\u2019s fucked up. Full stop. That\u2019s not right.\n\nI hope to god this comment section has some sense, but I have a feeling people are going to say YTA simply because you want your children to all be loved equally by your partner, who is acknowledged by your children as *dad*. Usually how this sub goes is if they\u2019re not blood, it\u2019s okay to treat them like they\u2019re less than. Fucking christ.", "NTA I wouldn't be having a kid with him. Point stop. It's not fair to you, your current kids, or a new baby.", "Seems like couples counseling would do you both some good.

Anyways, although, he is really smart, he did have behavior issues as a teen, and my dad at times has treated him a bit different. We (other siblings) were told much later that he wasn't my dad's bio kid, but we never cared about that. However, because at times as an adult he has behaved badly and given in to his AH wife, my dad has been, let's say, cold, even to his daughters. He DOES love my brother and has stated so, but given my brother's behavior, he's just cautious.

You do need to talk this through however with your fianc\u00e9 and get things straight about what he meant. Jumping to conclusions like people in the comments here are doing isn't helping either way.

Ultimately though, if he\u2019s a good step dad, he\u2019s doing everything that\u2019s necessary and expected. \n\nIf it does happen, that he treats them differently, you have to find a way to either accept it or not stay in a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t meet your expectations for a fair step father.

She was great when it was just me and my older sister but when her and my father had my half brother, my sister and I were thrown to the side. When asked why, my stepmother said that we were not her true kids and that she wanted a child that was really hers. Needless to say, we don\u2019t speak much now.

You might still give a hug and some physical comfort occasionally but not usually quite as often as the bio parent might bc they have already been doing it for years.

He is loving them and raising them and caring but then but also navigating being fair to their relationship with their lost dad and those memories. That\u2019s a line he won\u2019t have to walk or consider with his bio child. It\u2019s not less love, it\u2019s respect.

Your husband doesn't know this for sure and it sounds like he expressed a feeling to you during a time he was being vulnerable and open. On the other hand, I understand why it upset you. The truth is that for some parents, the biological factor does make a difference. This is where it's important for step-parents to have a lot of self-awareness and ability to self-reflect so they can work to manage this difference. Of course, your fiance also doesn't know this for fact. It sounds like it's just a fear of his. He may realize that the bond he has with your boys is just as much as the new baby.

Until one day my sister, as an adult, said to me \"You know why dad did that right? Because he knew you could take care of yourself...and he knows I just can't.\" I never thought about it like that before.\n\nAnd then I had my second child and I was terrified I wouldn't love him as much. How could I possibly love another child as much as I love my first? Turns out, love is not pie. Taking a piece doesn't mean there is less for others. Love is infinite.

Sure, and that\u2019s something that you should both be mindful of, but not love.

You could try some couples therapy sessions if he fails to see the fault in his planned future behaviour. These are options which may lead to a positive outcome.\n\nHowever, one of the more negative options would be splitting up if this doesn't get resolved, and then what will you do? Will you keep the baby? If so then he'll probably only provide support for his biological child, which in turn will cause resentment for you and hurt/jealousy for your boys not understanding why their Dad doesn't seem to love them anymore, which will only demonstrate how **cruel** your fiance' is. Financials will also not be great for you and it may take a while for you to get into a good routine without relying on him.\n\nAnother negative option, which is a decision many women would rather not have to make, is getting an abortion. A few people have already mentioned that it would be a good option in ensuring there will be no favouritism of any kind.

Your reaction is not based on nothing. Your protective instincts are telling you there's a danger here. But conversations are in order first. Your fiance needs to sort through why he thinks as he does and clearly assess if he can be unbiased as a parent of three. If not, you're done here.

So, that does make me think he\u2019s been pretty supportive of her and hasn\u2019t been asking for much support. So, that\u2019s good.

But it\u2019s probably more beneficial for all four, soon to be five, people involved to work on the issue and resolve it.
