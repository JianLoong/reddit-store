It's one thing to have clothing preferences and you can't police her about that. But there are occasions you have to dress for. You can't dress formal while playing sports or in this case wear casual / revealing clothing to a sophisticated restaurant. You would be TA if you made this a regular day to day thing, but I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask her to dress differently for a few hours at a fancy place.", "NTA.  One of your jobs as your daughter's mother is to guide/teach her.  Her preferred dress was not appropriate for the occasion and you did right in stepping up to let her know this.  Also, to your daughter's credit, she apparently complied.", "100% dressing for the occasion is a critical life skill. Not all outfits are appropriate for all occasions.   Skimpy shorts and bra tops don\u2019t have that many occasions so she needs to learn what to wear when.", "You\u2019re right, I\u2019m so bad at wording.", "Beat me to it! That's what I was gunna say lol", "I\u2019d just go back and talk it out so she understands.", "NTA. I'm a teacher and I had a student ask me last week if I ever wore shorts to school or tank tops. I explained to her that I rarely wear shorts because most of my shorts are for going to the beach or the hot summertime and teachers are professionals, and what I wear at school reflects that. It's not the place for my tiny denim shorts like the ones she was wearing. I explained that she's a kid (8 years old) and school is a casual place for kids so for her it was different. She said that it made sense. If an 8 year old can understand, so can your 17 year old.", "NTA. There's telling her what to wear & asking her to dress appropriately for the occasion. At 17 she should know this.", "NTA but I think you would have more success if you went at it from the angle of \u201cthis isn\u2019t fancy enough for the restaurant\u201d instead of \u201cthis is too skimpy\u201d. You will never win the battle over what she chooses to wear, her body her choice. But you have a good case if the clothing isn\u2019t appropriate for the occasion. It has nothing to do with how revealing it is", "NTA\n\nNothing wrong with dressing for an occasion", "NTA, but maybe go back and talk to her about how there is a \u201ctime and place\u201d for different kinds of outfits. While you support her freedom to dress the way she prefers, sometimes you have to make concessions based off of \u201ctime and place\u201d.", "NTA-You were asking her to dress in a manner appropriate for the place where you were dining. She likely saw it as force because she didn\u2019t like being told how to dress.", "A truly, \"fancy,\" restaurant wouldn't even let her in. Maybe she needs that experience.", "NTA\n\nYou asked her to dress for a specific occasion and location which is reasonable. At 17 you should know that a fancy restaurant is not the place to wear skimpy casual clothes.", "NTA because there\u2019s a time and place. She might\u2019ve even been denied entry if the place was formal. That would\u2019ve been even more embarrassing for her.", "NTA\n\nI know it is unfashionable to say this, but different clothes are appropriate in different situations, and it is your job as a parent to teach your kids that.", "You needed to make sure she understood that certain clothes are for certain situations. A fancy sophisticated restaurant requires more than a bra top and short shorts. She\u2019s old enough to learn how to dress for the occasion. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t wear white at a wedding, fancy clothes are for fancy events.\n\nNTA", "Nta.\n\n\nI\u2019ve seen women dressed as you\u2019re describing and it\u2019s basically walking around in public wearing your underwear. It\u2019s not appropriate for a classy venue. \n\nGood on you for letting her dress how she wants on the day-to-day, because she should be able to dress herself how she wants. But you explained that it was propriety and not modesty that she was looking for in this setting. Knowing how to dress in varying settings and situations is an important skill, and street clothes are not fancy restaurant clothes", "Nah. You are right that she needs to learn to dress for the occasion and like another has said a better word is to dress more formally. Maybe you guys can have a bonding moment and go shopping for some formal wear that fits her style.", "NTA your not asking her to cover up cause Uncle Sam's coming over your asking her to cover up cause your going to a fancy restaurant it's ok to not really be dressed when at home but here are places were you should absolutely dreas up and a fancy restaurant (actually any restaurant really) you should be dressed up", "nta - but i am surprised that the fancy estabishment would allow her in given those places usually have a dress code.", "NTA but who is buying her those clothes?", "When I was 15 I was heading out to a midnight screening of Rocky Horror downtown dressed in a merry widow, fishnets and dark red lipstick. My mother looked at me, was silent for a few seconds, then handed me her full length black velvet opera cloak and cab fare home. LEsson learned. Maybe you could have handled it better but NAH", "She's your daughter and not yet an adult. Of course you can tell her to dress appropriately.

There is a time and place for everything. You are more tolerant than most parents would be of their minor daughter wearing such revealing clothing. She needs to learn when and where. There is such a thing as a social dress code when going out.", "NTA\n\nMy parents tell me to cover up more when I am in front of people that would judge me or talk shit. They don't care much about what I wear with friends. There is a time and place for everything and it's not like you are controlling what she wears every time.", "Nta", "Nope, NTA. She needs to learn how to dress for different occasions.", "NTA since it was a special occasion.", "NTA. She\u2019s old to enough to know what\u2019s appropriate and what\u2019s not. Good for you for not policing her clothing choices at all times, but this was a good call.\nI have to have the same conversations with my sister on her choices of what she wears to work. I think she learned the lesson when she got fired for being to provocative. It was tough to keep that \u201cI told you so\u201d to myself\u2026", "NTA.\n\nThere's a time and place and clearly what your daughter was planning to wear was inappropriate for both. At 17 she's old enough to understand that.", "NTA because \n\n1. Learning to dress for the occasion \n\n2. She is still a minor & if you feel uncomfortable with her going out in an outfit that can be a responsibility on your end", "NTA\n\nYour daughter is still a teenager and is still more focused on getting attention and looking good than dressing appropriately for the occasion. You are her mother so you can put some guidelines and rules regarding appropriate clothing without telling her how to dress.", "As others have pointed out, I think it\u2019s all in the way you explain it. \n\nIf you\u2019re not shaming her or belittling her, but simply explaining that certain places expect a certain type of dress; this restaurant is a bit upscale so you need her to change into something that\u2019s more fitting to the proper attire of the restaurant, NTA. \n\nIf you berated her about how her outfit was too skimpy and revealing and she needed to \u201cput more clothes on\u201d, then I\u2019d redact my vote and you\u2019d be T A. \n\nOverall props for stating that as a general rule, you wouldn\u2019t care about what she wears. I think teens certainly need guidance on what\u2019s appropriate for what situations & what\u2019s not, but I also know that teens are just trying to figure out who they are and what suits them. Growing up in a very conservative household, I remember countless talks about needing to \u201cput more clothes on\u201d and even to this day my mom will comment on my swim suits & what not, and I\u2019m thirty-freakin-five. I grew up *loathing* the word modest. Again, not saying you should allow your teen to walk around in her underwear in public, but the words you choose when disciplining her are crucial.", "NTA\nLearning to dress appropriately for the situation is a life skill. You are her parent and it\u2019s appropriate for you to instruct her.", "I was taught there is a time and place for how to dress. You were in the right.", "NTA. Start wearing muscle shirts and short shorts around her and she\u2019ll get the point.", "NTA\n\ndo you buy her clothes? Do not buy her clothes. Going forward, set your expectations on how she needs to be dressed for occasions like this long before you go - and if she argues, leave her home.\n\nSigned,\nGirl who\u2019s dad shielded his eyes like he had been scalded when I dropped something and went to pick it up and he said he was \u201cembarrassed and offended\u201d by my skimpy clothes and that was all it took before I put on more clothes - because no matter what she\u2019s wearing, Luna is horrified at the thought of her dad seeing her naked", "Most weddings I've been to in the last 20 years have had the odd jeans clad guest. No one died. \n\nThat being said, Instagram influencer at Coachella attire is not something an adult would consider appropriate for a fancy extended family dinner. She's just pushing boundaries and using self-expression as an excuse to be daft.", "The wedding thing depends on the wedding, though mostly it\u2019s slacks and not jeans. My cousin had a wedding a couple of weeks ago and told us that jeans are appropriate.", "The jeans thing at weddings does depend. In my extended family, we don't really have a formal dress code for weddings, and as long as it's smart casual, you're okay. So smart looking jeans or black jeans are fine for us. Even most of the grooms have never worn a tux st their own weddings and the smartest anyone dressed was a 2 piece suit and no tie", "I was thinking this.", "Herself.", "buying what, her bras? at 17, I should hope she's buying her own by now", "Excuse me?", "why? she should know that what she was wearing was not appropriate for the reteraunr that they were going to.", "Yeah, but she's also young enough to lack real-world experience about norms and expectations is various settings. This is what parents are for, to help teach their kids about what is/isn't appropriate so they have a better shot at making it in the world. A bra top and daisy dukes are not appropriate for fine dining with extended family in most places.", "A restaurants dress code has nothing to do with age.", "why? she should know that what she was wearing was not appropriate for the resteraunt that they were going to", "Yeah I totally agree and understand I did tell her she needed more modest cloths for dinner, I am just so bad at wording, it\u2019s something I need to work on.", "I think the concept to focus on is \u201ceverything has its time and place.\u201d You weren\u2019t telling her to never wear those outfits, even though they bother you, because you understand that letting her express her individuality is a good thing. You were trying to convey that a dinner in a fancy restaurant with family members she doesn\u2019t know well wasn\u2019t the right time or place for that outfit. \n\nTry apologizing for your bad wording and explaining what you really meant. It could go a long way.", "I definitely will talk to her when she\u2019s home."]}
