The restaurant we all agreed to go to was very fancy and sophisticated. Again if this was any other situation I wouldn\u2019t care about what she decided to wear. Luna was going to wear one of those bloody bra tops like one wrong move and you know, she also wore the shortest shorts I\u2019ve possibly ever seen.

She wasn\u2019t necessarily mad at me for making her change but she seemed kind of off on the way home.

It's one thing to have clothing preferences and you can't police her about that. But there are occasions you have to dress for. You can't dress formal while playing sports or in this case wear casual / revealing clothing to a sophisticated restaurant. You would be TA if you made this a regular day to day thing, but I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask her to dress differently for a few hours at a fancy place.", "NTA.

Also, to your daughter's credit, she apparently complied.", "100% dressing for the occasion is a critical life skill. Not all outfits are appropriate for all occasions.
