Also, to your daughter's credit, she apparently complied.", "100% dressing for the occasion is a critical life skill. Not all outfits are appropriate for all occasions.

It's not the place for my tiny denim shorts like the ones she was wearing. I explained that she's a kid (8 years old) and school is a casual place for kids so for her it was different.

You are her mother so you can put some guidelines and rules regarding appropriate clothing without telling her how to dress.", "As others have pointed out, I think it\u2019s all in the way you explain it. \n\nIf you\u2019re not shaming her or belittling her, but simply explaining that certain places expect a certain type of dress; this restaurant is a bit upscale so you need her to change into something that\u2019s more fitting to the proper attire of the restaurant, NTA. \n\nIf you berated her about how her outfit was too skimpy and revealing and she needed to \u201cput more clothes on\u201d, then I\u2019d redact my vote and you\u2019d be T A. \n\nOverall props for stating that as a general rule, you wouldn\u2019t care about what she wears. I think teens certainly need guidance on what\u2019s appropriate for what situations & what\u2019s not, but I also know that teens are just trying to figure out who they are and what suits them.

Fancy dinners, some people's churches, workplaces and settings that are formal require both men and women to be appropriately presentable. \n\nChildren have to learn that while expressing yourself in casual settings is a wonderful opportunity they are being afforded... there are times and places where your personality absolutely has to shine through the clothing instead of being in the clothing. \n\nNext time, maybe avoid this by offering to take her shopping for a nice dress or slacks and a blouse specifically for [insert special occassion].

Wearing an inappropriate outfit for an occasion definitely can ruin an event.  It used to be everyone dressed up for church and weddings.  Now it's pretty much anything goes.  But to go to a family event at a 'fancy' restaurant needs more than a bra and hot pants.  Labeling someone for how they dress isn't the right thing to do but it happens.

You are NTAH.", "NTA\n\nAnd honestly, she needs a better variety of fashion influences.", "NTA. As a woman that always enjoyed showing skin I think asking her to wear something for a nice place is not much to ask for at all. Any chance it's she does not like skirts or dresses?

I was like your daughter when I was her age, but I still knew that some places you just don't wear certain types of clothing, and that of course was grown from fighting and  discussing it excessively with my mother, (and father in some instances).

My parents were strict about this and I agree now as I\u2019m older.", "NTA.\n\nShe\u2019s being a  brat. Not shaming anyone for their choice in clothes, but some places do require a certain etiquette. You can\u2019t go to a fancy restaurant wearing practically a bikini.

An outfit for the club or for hanging out with your girlfriends is not an outfit for a Nice restaurant for a special dinner with family. \n\nI think people need to understand there is a difference between shamming and asking that people dress for the ocassion. Sweats and a hoodie wouldn't be appropriate for the ocassion either. And the fact youndont say anything other times just shows even more your aren't the AH for your request. \n\nI think I longer discussion with her is needed as well.

Put some positive time together in her emotional tank. Dad's need to tell girls how some men think about dressing like that - what they think isn't her problem or her fault - but dressing appropriately shows respect for oneself.  Let her be 17 and dress like that on the beach or where ever it IS appropriate, but let her know she attracts a better class of people if she has a little dignity. There are unkind, lewd people and you want her to aim higher than that. But you have to tell her when you are doing something fun together, not yank her up on the way out of the door.", "NTA you re much more lenient than I would have been.

Don\u2019t beat yourself up about it and Id like to compliment your approach to how she dresses regularly as her parent as well, she may be mad for a little about small things like this but being allowed to express herself (at the appropriate times of course) through her clothing regularly is something I\u2019m sure she will appreciate later in life and is so meaningful for kids.", "While I fully agree that someone should be able to wear what they want, etiquette is also an important life skill.\n\nShe was meeting relatives at a nice restaurant, I know some people will disagree, but I think that is not the time nor place to wear nothing but a bra and booty shorts.\n\nWhile I think it's great your daughter has confidence, she needs to learn this lesson.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nThere's nothing wrong dressing like that for comfort.
