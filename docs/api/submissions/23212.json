You stated you payed for your own meal therefore you should order what you want.

You having a beer is not religious persecution.", "NTA. OP you are right not everything a non Mormon does is attacking their faith. As long as you and your wife pay for the meal and drinks its not the in laws issue if you have a beer. \nBest advice is go No Contact and be free!", "NTA You didn't bring a six pack of beer to your in laws house, you ordered a beer at a restaurant with a liquor license.

Super conceited of them to expect people to adapt to their beliefs.", "NTA.\n\nI mean, unless you're insulting them to their face about their faith and taking alcohol into their home, they don't get a say in public.\n\nI was *very* religious for a long time, and it came with very strict dietary guidelines. I never expected anyone to adhere to the standards I held myself. It was my faith, not theirs. Of course, they had to respect my dietary rules while in my house, but if we all went out to eat, it was their business what they ordered. If the restaurant had nothing for me, it was incumbent upon me and my private dedication to my faith to decline the invitation.\n\nLuckily for you it sounds like your wife is on your side on this, because it can get ugly if that's not the case. My advice is to avoid provocation whenever possible, but that does not mean they get to impose the tenants of their faith upon you.\n\nI also have Mormon in-laws and I drink in front of them, by the way. I don't bring beer to family gatherings at a private house or whatever, but I will order wine if we're out. I assure you that my Mormon in-laws are much more Mormon than perhaps anyone but Warren Jeffs himself (they are FLDS), and they still are polite enough to mind their own damn business about whether I occasionally have a beer or coffee in public.

If we are eating out none of them would expect me to follow their dietary rules at a restaurant or party. If we were at their home generally I think you gotta respect house rules.

Every time I ate something for lunch that contained animal products, they would get visibly upset and rant at me about how offended they were. It was absolutely ridiculous.\n\nIt's the same concept.

Guessing you can\u2019t drink a cola or coffee in their self righteous presence either.", "NTA because it wasn't meant as a slight.\n\nI'll avoid drinking around some people because of their religion, sobriety status, or other reasons. I consider it a sign of respect. If your inlaws were being less than respectful with you for whatever reason, I can get not caring anymore.

The first half of your post is how touchy and easily offended they are.  You can do what you want but then you take the consequences.

It was even weirder to learn that they weren't harping over nothing and those were big issues out west with wards being cultish, making up their own sub beliefs and rules.
