My family doesn't live here, they live about two hours away. \n\nHe recently got a promotion at his job. Our house is a little bit further away from the city, we live in a farm type house (although it's not a very big portion of land, but we have neighbors that have bigger properties, point is our neighbors live kinda away). With his new position he'll need to travel sometimes, his first trip was last year, he had to travel for two days. I honestly did not had a good time, because I was alone and away from neighbors, I did not felt safe. \n\nI spoke to him and we agreed that next time I'll ask a friend to come stay with me. Well he needed to travel last week too, this time it was three days. I told him I was gonna ask a friend (Jennifer), he left early in the morning. \nI thought about it and then I started overthinking, I don't think I'll feel safe if it's just Jennifer and I, we're still two women alone. So I called my BIl Ashton (m24) if he could come stay with me instead, he agreed so I called Jennifer to tell her my plans had changed. \n\nHe came home around 6 that day, we had dinner together, chat and watched a movie together. We mainly did those stuff during the time he stayed here. My husband and I spoke on thw phone but I didn't told him I had called his brother instead of Jennifer. Ash and I are close, I am with all of his family, so I didn't think he would mind. \n\nMy husband came home last Thursday around 8PM. When he saw that Ashton was here he was a bit taken aback. As it was late I told BIL to stay one more night if he wanted to and he did. I could tell my husband was upset, I asked him what happened and he told me nothing. The next day, after he got home from work, he was still upset so I asked him again what's going on. He said that we had agreed that I was gonna call a friend, he didn't agree with having BIL over. I gave him my reasons as to why I called him instead. He still said that I shouldn't have called him because I know that their relationship is not the best. We argued and now he's even more upset with me for not even apologizing, he asked if I am gonna call Ash everytime he goes out and I told him yes, I'll do that because I don't want to stay alone.

If you can get to the root cause and address why he feels discomfort that would be ideal, and it could possibly even help them repair their relationship if your husband sees that Ashton is doing this truly just to help.\n\nThe problem remains that you are living in a somewhat isolated area and do not always have someone with you in case your ex does show up. Have you gotten a restraining order against him? If you do then if he does show up he can be arrested for violating that. He can be arrested for trespassing even if you don't have one and he appears. \n\nThe restraining order is just a piece of paper though. I would encourage you to get an alarm system and dogs, either one of the traditional protection or livestock guardian breeds. Get more than one. They are a great visual deterrent, early alert system, and means of protection in the worst case scenario. \n\nIf you take self defense classes, they could give you practical skills to defend yourself as well as boost your confidence. Depending on the laws where you live, you may want to consider getting firearm and taking classes on how to use it in general and in self-defense situations. \n\nIf you do some of these things combined with getting therapy for your understandable anxiety about being in the house by yourself, I think they will go a long way toward making you feel more secure in your home.

Therapy does work, but it's important to find a competent one that fits you, aswell as getting the correct therapy form.", "I understand. I have PTSD myself.\n\nCan I ask what therapy form your therapist uses? I've had very good results with EMDR.", "Unfortunately, I'm getting there too. \n\nThere is just too much shadyness about her actions. \n\nIf she didn't think it would be a problem, why not tell him? \n\nSuddenly, there's an ex. Who didn't show up last time, but was gonna this time?", "Wow, you've just shown more consideration and empathy for Jennifer than you have for your husband. Why is he expected to be OK with being highly uncomfortable?", "Nope, none of this is making you look any better. \n\nWhy would he ask if your friend was there? He didn't know you changed your plans. \n\nYour saying the entire time he *never* said how's Jenn? Or are you two having fun? How was your day? What did you do? \n\nYou never said \"we watched movies\" or \"we made X for dinner?\" \n\nNot buying it. \n\nLying by omission is still lying and breaking trust.", ">I didn't want to talk about BIL or someone else, he also didn't ask so I assumed he didn't care either, I felt like it was unimportant. \n\nThis could be a sign that you could easily doing something behind his back because you assume if he doesn't ask it means he's going to be okay. And you know about the relationship in the past between your husband and his brother.", "Why would he ask about him being there when you told him Jennifer would be there? Seems pretty shady", "Exactly. Especially since it takes two to tango. Out of all people, the BIL is the least likely non-husband man in OPs life to make an unwanted move on her. \n\nAnd also, the SIL most likely doesn\u2019t have any romantic feelings toward her BIL. To assume either has feelings for each other reeks of all these poster\u2019s own insecurities.", "We're trying CBT, now we're in SIT stage, she asked me to avoid triggers so I have to avoid being alone since now it's my main trigger.\n\nAnd yes I've tried EMDR but it didn't work for me, it made my anxiety worse so my therapist changed her method.", "Exactly. For me it's also that she had shown absolutely no awareness of how her actions could be hurting her husband. She's shown more consideration and empathy for Jennifer in one comment than she has for him in this entire thing. It's like she wants a divorce."]}
