My family doesn't live here, they live about two hours away. \n\nHe recently got a promotion at his job. Our house is a little bit further away from the city, we live in a farm type house (although it's not a very big portion of land, but we have neighbors that have bigger properties, point is our neighbors live kinda away). With his new position he'll need to travel sometimes, his first trip was last year, he had to travel for two days. I honestly did not had a good time, because I was alone and away from neighbors, I did not felt safe. \n\nI spoke to him and we agreed that next time I'll ask a friend to come stay with me. Well he needed to travel last week too, this time it was three days. I told him I was gonna ask a friend (Jennifer), he left early in the morning. \nI thought about it and then I started overthinking, I don't think I'll feel safe if it's just Jennifer and I, we're still two women alone. So I called my BIl Ashton (m24) if he could come stay with me instead, he agreed so I called Jennifer to tell her my plans had changed. \n\nHe came home around 6 that day, we had dinner together, chat and watched a movie together. We mainly did those stuff during the time he stayed here. My husband and I spoke on thw phone but I didn't told him I had called his brother instead of Jennifer. Ash and I are close, I am with all of his family, so I didn't think he would mind. \n\nMy husband came home last Thursday around 8PM. When he saw that Ashton was here he was a bit taken aback. As it was late I told BIL to stay one more night if he wanted to and he did. I could tell my husband was upset, I asked him what happened and he told me nothing. The next day, after he got home from work, he was still upset so I asked him again what's going on. He said that we had agreed that I was gonna call a friend, he didn't agree with having BIL over. I gave him my reasons as to why I called him instead. He still said that I shouldn't have called him because I know that their relationship is not the best. We argued and now he's even more upset with me for not even apologizing, he asked if I am gonna call Ash everytime he goes out and I told him yes, I'll do that because I don't want to stay alone.

If you can get to the root cause and address why he feels discomfort that would be ideal, and it could possibly even help them repair their relationship if your husband sees that Ashton is doing this truly just to help.\n\nThe problem remains that you are living in a somewhat isolated area and do not always have someone with you in case your ex does show up. Have you gotten a restraining order against him? If you do then if he does show up he can be arrested for violating that. He can be arrested for trespassing even if you don't have one and he appears. \n\nThe restraining order is just a piece of paper though. I would encourage you to get an alarm system and dogs, either one of the traditional protection or livestock guardian breeds. Get more than one. They are a great visual deterrent, early alert system, and means of protection in the worst case scenario. \n\nIf you take self defense classes, they could give you practical skills to defend yourself as well as boost your confidence. Depending on the laws where you live, you may want to consider getting firearm and taking classes on how to use it in general and in self-defense situations. \n\nIf you do some of these things combined with getting therapy for your understandable anxiety about being in the house by yourself, I think they will go a long way toward making you feel more secure in your home.

No one is being forced here. You\u2019re ridiculous.. lol sell the farmhouse?", "When I made that comment, she had not given any details regarding why she was afraid. Sorry, but at that point, it did sound like the \u201cdamsel in dustres.\u201d\n\nI suffer from anxiety, so I understand how \u201cirrational\u201d fears can be. However, the more I reread her initial post, the more I don\u2019t understand the situation. \n\nShe apparently believes that it\u2019s totally ok to ask and basically expect her BIL (whom she knows her husband isn\u2019t on great terms with) to stay with her each time her husband goes out of town. This was not a one time ask, and she knows it. That I don\u2019t understand. My anxiety is mine to manage, and it\u2019s no one else\u2019s burden or inconvenience. So I absolutely don\u2019t understand the approach of asking someone to stay for a few days every time hubby goes out of town unless it had been discussed (in detail) with all parties involved. \n\nAlso (after reading her comments), I don\u2019t understand how she and the husband didn\u2019t discuss a plan for this. She rightfully has anxiety over this sort of situation. Did she not communicate with her husband about it? Did she, and he ignored it? Why didn\u2019t she mention it to her hubby that his brother was with her? \n\nShe knows he doesn\u2019t want his golden child brother to stay in the home, but she told him she was going to do it anyway. That\u2019s a recipe for divorce.", "It doesnt even have to about jealousy, not everyone has family they can completely trust to be in their house.", "Safety in numbers. Why cancel with Jennifer? Why couldn\u2019t she still hangout and you also invite Ashton? So scared you needed company and communicated that when it was your friend but not scared enough to explain why her company wasn\u2019t enough to your husband?", "Seems convenient that you added this after most told you yta", "Get training/buy a gun", "Don\u2019t tell her that ;)", "[deleted]", "Yup. I'm 5'2, 90 pounds and chronically ill. I sometimes get people telling me shit like that, \"oh don't be so fragile, go take a self defense class, girl power!\" like that'd magically keep me safe against the average male attacker. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm as feminist as they come, but I'm well aware of my physical limitations and denying that can be actively harmful.", "[deleted]", "Not without telling their partner. She doesn\u2019t need to ask permission but she damn sure has to mention it. If you can\u2019t see how this is an issue in the marriage, then you are the one with the problem. Communication is key. She is lying by omission.", "Sure, that\u2019s what I said", "I literally just said \u201cclearly we shouldn\u2019t hide.\u201d But it\u2019s not abnormal to be worried about danger, that\u2019s a normal human response. If someone wants to take extra precautions like having someone stay with them, what\u2019s the issue? Why is pepper spray okay but you draw the line at having someone stay with you? It\u2019s not fragile, it\u2019s just another precaution.", "If you didn't want to bang Ashton, you would have told your husband instead of lying."]}
