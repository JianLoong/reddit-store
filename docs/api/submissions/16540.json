Our house is a little bit further away from the city, we live in a farm type house (although it's not a very big portion of land, but we have neighbors that have bigger properties, point is our neighbors live kinda away). With his new position he'll need to travel sometimes, his first trip was last year, he had to travel for two days. I honestly did not had a good time, because I was alone and away from neighbors, I did not felt safe. \n\nI spoke to him and we agreed that next time I'll ask a friend to come stay with me. Well he needed to travel last week too, this time it was three days. I told him I was gonna ask a friend (Jennifer), he left early in the morning. \nI thought about it and then I started overthinking, I don't think I'll feel safe if it's just Jennifer and I, we're still two women alone. So I called my BIl Ashton (m24) if he could come stay with me instead, he agreed so I called Jennifer to tell her my plans had changed. \n\nHe came home around 6 that day, we had dinner together, chat and watched a movie together. We mainly did those stuff during the time he stayed here. My husband and I spoke on thw phone but I didn't told him I had called his brother instead of Jennifer. Ash and I are close, I am with all of his family, so I didn't think he would mind. \n\nMy husband came home last Thursday around 8PM. When he saw that Ashton was here he was a bit taken aback. As it was late I told BIL to stay one more night if he wanted to and he did. I could tell my husband was upset, I asked him what happened and he told me nothing. The next day, after he got home from work, he was still upset so I asked him again what's going on. He said that we had agreed that I was gonna call a friend, he didn't agree with having BIL over. I gave him my reasons as to why I called him instead. He still said that I shouldn't have called him because I know that their relationship is not the best. We argued and now he's even more upset with me for not even apologizing, he asked if I am gonna call Ash everytime he goes out and I told him yes, I'll do that because I don't want to stay alone.

Instead he comes home to find his single BIL, alone with you. Why should your husband trust that you weren't having sex the whole time when you've just proven you can't be trusted in general?", "Maybe not as bad, but fundamentally yes. It was mutually agreed that you would have Jennifer over. You were the AH the second you called anyone but her and did not inform your husband about the change. It being BIL only made it worse. You know how your husband feels, so what do you do? You invite him over behind your husbands back. BIL got all of their families attention, now he is getting yours. The worst part of it all is that you refuse to see what you are doing to your husband.", "So not only does your husband feel like his family value his brother more than him, he now finds out that you his own wife value his brother over him\u2026", "and now your husband feels like you're putting his brother over his feelings.", "Yta. You've made your husband's brother the golden child in your marriage. This is some serious overstepping.", "Which you are adding to.   Do you want to stay married?", "That was why I was asking. \n\n\"Not the best.\" With siblings could mean anything from just not great friends to LC/NC\n\nIt's her home as well. \n\nSo, to me, if they are low or no contact, then OP is an AH completely. \n\nIf it's a normal sibling relationship but they are not \"best friends\" just family. Than to me is more everyone sucks. \nAnd they need to work on how they communicate with each other.", "Oh boy, \n\nAre you trying to blow up your marriage? Do you have any idea how damaging the \"Golden Child/Scape Goat dynamic is to kids? The pain it can cause, the actions that get excused/blamed?\n\nWhat do you hope to accomplish? Punishing your husband for having to travel for work?\n\nOr do you just thrive on drama? \n\nDo you care about your husband's feelings at all? \n\nDid your BIL ever chase a previous love interest of your husband's? \n\nAs a woman, I'm also extremely confused as to why the BIL made you feel safer. Does his penis shoot bullets? \nRealistically, how does he make you any safer than having a girl friend around?", "So... your husband doesn't want him over, right?", "Thanks,  \n\nI got an amazing son out of the deal and I would go through it all again just to have him.  So as they say, \"At least I got that going for me\".", "OK this makes a bit more sense now.\n\nI suspect you need to talk to someone about your justifiable anxiety, and then I suggest that you investigate getting yourself a dog. It is possible to get a trained personal protection dog, or a regular dog which you could train for this purpose. Facing down a well trained dog is not for the faint hearted.\n\nI'm sorry that your ex was so bad and I hope you can regain the confidence to live your life.", "You need to get a security system with cameras so the next time your husband travels you don\u2019t inconvenience someone to come and hold your hand while your husband isn\u2019t there. \n\nYTA", "I agree OP is overreacting, but you're being very dismissive of her anxiety. It really sounds like you're accusing her of pretending to be scared for attention. \n\nMy SO will be out of town for a weekend soon, and even with 3 dogs and nearby neighbors, I still get anxious being alone at night. You wouldn't tell someone with depression to just be happy right? So don't tell someone with anxiety to just not be scared.", "I am in therapy already", "She IS putting his brother over his feelings.", "His penis does not shoot bullets, at least I am not aware of that. I feel safer when a man is home too because I know that if my ex wants to hurt me again he won't try anything if another man is home, he'll leave. And I feel close to BIL because he's nice, so I feel ok having him around for a couple days.", "We have cameras and a alarm, but if someone breaks in I'll take some time for the police to arrive", "But do you use it as an excuse to invite a man over?", "That\u2019s good. What does your therapist say about this irrational fear of yours? Do you recognize that you can\u2019t keep asking people to stay with you when your husband travels? \n\nCan you go visit someone? Hotel?", "Yeah, that's a BS excuse, my dear. And it's interesting you don't answer any questions about BIL history. \n\nFrom your Op\n\n>I honestly did not had a good time, because I was alone and away from neighbors, I did not felt safe. \n\n>I thought about it and then I started overthinking, I don't think I'll feel safe if it's just Jennifer and I, we're still two women alone. So I called my BIl Ashton (m24) if he could come stay with me instead, he agreed so I called Jennifer to tell her my plans had changed. \n\nYou mentioned isolation and loneliness. Not an abusive stalker ex that now magically appears to try and justify your need for a man. \n\nEspecially since you canceled your friend coming. The three of you could have gotten together for a week with much less issue. Or your BIL could have joined for a few days. \n\nIf being married isn't stopping your ex, then another man around won't either. And if you were truly worried about that, then having your friend come too would be a better deterant. Or were you hoping that your BIL got hurt? \n\nAnd why wouldn't you communicate your fears to your husband? Surely he knows how dangerous your ex is? \n\nYou never mentioned your BIL being there the entire time he was gone, got caught and are now trying to justify your actions. \n\nAgain, do you care about your husband or marriage? Or are you punishing him?", "And you don't give a single care about how your closeness is affecting your husband? Keep ruining your marriage.", "Oh I\u2019m sure you know all too well what his penis shoots \ud83e\udd23 have fun breaking up your marriage by sleeping with your husbands brother \ud83e\udd2e", "Also, good job ignoring every single question she asked except for the one about BILs penis.", "Then go stay at a hotel while he\u2019s gone! Gees! \n\nWhat exactly do you think a \u201cbig strong male\u201d is going to do to magically protect you? Do you think they\u2019re going to wrestle to the death or something? \n\nLearn to protect yourself. Are you in the US? If so, do you have a firearm and are proficient with it? \n\nYour damsel in distress act is gross, IMO. Either move closer to authorities being able to respond quicker and/or learn to protect yourself. Please stop asking men to stay with you alone overnight and possibly put their lives in danger for you.", "You need to practise self defense. Your attitude is getting you in trouble. I'm not pro gun, but I love grams who say their family women's motto is \"lock and load\". You might also consider therapy for your anxiety.\n\nInviting your BIL wile your husband is away is putting your marriage in jeopardy. Or as we say in Dutch \"tie the bacon on the cat\". YTA for that.", "My therapist told me if I don't feel safe in a place or with someone I need to ask help from someone I trust, usually my husband is there so I am not that scared, but when he is gone I am scared that my ex or someone else might hurt me again so I asked for help\n\nWe have two dogs, we can't leave them alone", "An abusive man who specifically targets women and children will often avoid attacking if another man is present, because they are cowards. They\u2019re scared of getting hurt so they are unwilling to attack. If they see something like a truck, big boots, or hear a deep voice, they will piss themselves running away.\n\nThis makes a male presence actually more effective than most security systems, depending on the aggressor in question. Even if the male does no defending or just calls the police, the danger is decreased.\n\nShe\u2019s stated she has an abusive ex who has hurt her before, your vitriol is unnecessary", "I am scared that my ex will try to hurt me when I am alone since he did already and I know that if another man is home then he will not try to do anything, but if I am alone or if I am with a girl friend then he might try it. The police will take too much time to come if the alarm goes off", "I am already in therapy, a gun wouldn't help because I'll freeze if anything happens, I can't physically defend myself", "Do you have pet friendly hotel in an area where there is quick response time for authorities? \n\nWhat does your therapist define as \u201chelp\u201d from someone you trust? IMO, asking anyone to drop what they\u2019re doing to come and stay with you for a few days goes beyond \u201chelp\u201d and morphs into dependence. \n\nDid you and your husband have an in-depth discussion regarding your very real fears when he would be required to travel?\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m coming across as harsh, but how you\u2019re managing your fears (regarding when your husband travels) is unsustainable. Your fears are real and justified. However, others can\u2019t be asked to \u201cbend\u201d to your fears. You and your husband need to figure out a solution, and that can\u2019t (ultimately) be expecting friends and family to come and protect you.", "Please edit your post and include this very important detail. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask anyone (man or woman) to act as your personal bodyguard. You\u2019re assuming that your ex will know that a male is staying with you so won\u2019t try anything. \n\nDo you have a restraining order against your ex? \n\nIf your husband is going to be traveling more often, you and he must figure out a solution so you are calmer and more secure. Asking others to come over and stay with you is not a solution, ultimately. \n\nWhat about a highly trained guard dog? Have you talked to your local authorities about your very real fear? Have you asked them to tell you about their response time and how to balance that with your fear?\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have asked your BIL to stay with you without speaking to your husband and getting his approval for his brother to stay alone with you. \n\nI truly hope you and your husband can figure out a long term solution so it doesn\u2019t impact your marriage.", "What are you going to do if BIL isn\u2019t available? Better yet, what are you going to do when your husband leaves you?", "Then learn some self defense. (Preferably Crav Maga because there you learn to really protect yourself.)", "I have a restraining order but he did not care about it in the past. I think that he might know where I live and possibly he knows I am staying alone sometimes, so I think it's better to ask for help as my therapist told me to do. .\nWe have two dogs. If the alarm goes off the police will come as soon as they can, but it's at least a 30 minutes drive to our home.", "So your solution is to ask someone else to be alone in the house with you in case your ex attacks? What on earth do you expect your BIL to do? \n\nAgain, your therapist needs to define what is meant by \u201chelp.\u201d Putting someone\u2019s life in possible jeopardy to try and protect you is not \u201chelp\u201d IMO. It\u2019s irresponsibility. \n\nWhy did you move someplace where the authorities can take up to 30 minutes to respond? Why did your husband take the promotion knowing it would require travel and also knowing your fears and anxiety regarding your ex?"]}
