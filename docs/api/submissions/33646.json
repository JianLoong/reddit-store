My husband and I actually really liked the uncle and I was shocked that he suggested this. I simply stated no, I could never do that and moved on in the conversation. \n\nMy MIL is pretty manipulative and I suspected she had asked the uncle to suggest it to us in the hopes we\u2019d listen to him.

Especially when I felt like my MIL started to show favoritism towards my older daughter over the younger one that she wanted to abort. \n\nIn 2020, my husband finally confronted his mom about the abortion comment and the favoritism. My MIL admitted that she did have the uncle suggest an abortion. She tried to justify it by saying we were still young (26 at the time) and already had 1 daughter. She also stated that we got lucky with our first daughter and we might not get so lucky with our second child. My husband has mental health issues and she was basically afraid if we had another child, it would turn out like my husband.

There\u2019s generational trauma they passed down.
