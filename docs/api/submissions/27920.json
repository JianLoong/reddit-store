I'm glad you're taking this seriously, you just should have done so sooner.  Also anything she's bought that can be returned should be.  If it can't be returned lock it where she can't get it, donate it, or throw it away.  I think taking away what she bought will drive home the message.", "Nta she's stealing", "NTA.

Whilst that is correct, my counter to that would be, do you want to be right or do you want to have a good relationship with your daughter? It might technically be theft, but I don't think this is the sort of thing you want to ruin your relationship with her over. She is 17. Legally she can get her own place at 18 and never see you again, so I'd be careful about being too tough. Plenty of people have ruined their relationship with their kids over lesser things than this.

Giving her access to your credit card was your first mistake. And, when she started abusing the privilege, you should\u2019ve nipped that in the bud.

Once she realizes how hard earning money is, she will respect it more. I bet $300 shopping sprees will stop when its her own money. Finally, she needs to apologize big time for calling you names. That part could be why you take away the car for non essential stuff and tell  her that anytime she disrespect you or your wife, that will be the consequence.

Doing yard work for the place she lives is not \"paying back.\"\n\nDoes she have an actual job? She better. \n\nThis needs to be nipped the bud ASAP. I don't know why she or her brother feels that this is acceptable behaviour. She should never get to use the car for recreational use, and she should never get to use your credit card ever. You need to make clear the violation of trust, and frankly, make clear that people who repeatedly steal from you will not get to live in your household.\n\nI think your son might not understand it being such a big thing because money/credit is a tangible thing. Ask him how he would feel if you took something from him and gave it to someone else without asking him, and he could never get it back.

OP lost his temper when his kid did exactly what she said she was going to do and planned to pay him back the way she had a dozen times before.\n\nOP was angry that the charges were more than he expected to see, so he added the first thing he could think of as a punishment instead of sitting his kid down as soon as he heard her plans and explaining that he wasn't okay with this, locking the credit card, or doing literally anything proactive to parent his kid.", "I\u2019m guessing OP is in the UK based on language he used in his post. I\u2019m in Canada and I\u2019ve never had a cashier check that my card belongs to me. Hell it never leaves my hand. I either tap to pay or insert it in the machine and type my PIN.

NTA by a long shot. It is going to suck having to drive her around, but sometimes harsh punishment are needed. \n\nI did a parenting class 20+ years ago called Love and Logic. The basis was that you need to teach your kids that actions have consequences. Sometime good, and sometimes bad. You actually want your child to fail. It sounds harsh, but stay with me. You don\u2019t want it to happen frequently, but is this a better option than using a company card, and getting caught. That has the possibility of charges of theft or embezzlement. Fines, reimbursement, and possible jail time. This is the worst case scenario just to make a point. My son was late all the time because we had to look for his shoes every morning. The principal said I could send him in his socks. It happened and he wasn\u2019t allowed to do PE, and had to find something else during recess (he did have a few friends stay so he wasn\u2019t all alone). We knew where his shoes were every damn day after that!\n\nIf the loss of the car wasn\u2019t previously said as a punishment you may want to consider having a talk about possible punishments for the future.

Help her by removing the temptation.", "NTA- She is abusign your card.  Why does she have it though?", "Nta for *finally* having consequences, but dude, you made the rod for your own back.

That is theft. Turn the kid over to the cops. I don't allow stealing or anything bad or against the law.

From now on she's on her own to find a ride to the mall and money to spend.", "NTA this is reasonable and something I would do if I was a parent", "Wait, she STOLE the car, and its not a crime equal to the punishment in your opinion? Should she hurt someone first to warrant not car privileges?", "Great idea! I would have reported it stolen (because it was actually stolen), let her use the card without her knowing that I reported it, and then let the natural consequences of her actions work their magic. \n\nIf, as a teenager, I stole my parent\u2019s cc *multiple times* and then had the absolute *gall* to call said parent a *dick*?! Let\u2019s just say that my parent would have taken measures to ensure beyond a shadow of a doubt that that situation would NEVER happen again."]}
