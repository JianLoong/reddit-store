She would never get the car back. How selfish, spoiled and entitled she is!! So many kids never get a car so she should feel privileged. For her to take YOUR credit card without asking and use it is stealing, even if she pays it back.", "NTA, although it\u2019s definitely your fault for letting it get this far so it\u2019s borderline. You can\u2019t expect a teenager to act in-bounds if you let over the line behavior slide time and again. First credit card charge is a warning\u2026if it happens again you lose the card; second charge and the card disappears for a month\u2026the bullwhip makes it hard to learn a lesson (which is the goal of discipline).", "NTA\n\nIt's time for your daughter to get a job. She desperately needs to learn the value of a dollar. She can spend the first paycheck or two, paying your back. \n\nAlso, quit letting her take your credit card.", "NTA\n\nYou have consensus with your wife. It is an agreed parenting decision. \n\nToo much, too little... no one can tell for sure. \n\nAs an idea, allow her to do something to regain her privilege. Maybe ask her to volunteer in a soup kitchen, homeless shelter, etc", "YTA for not stopping this sooner.  She should have been punished after the first time she did this.  Pay it back in full, extra chores, no car, and no card access.  This is theft.  If she were to do this with say a college roommate she'd probably get charged with identity theft too.  I'm glad you're taking this seriously, you just should have done so sooner.  Also anything she's bought that can be returned should be.  If it can't be returned lock it where she can't get it, donate it, or throw it away.  I think taking away what she bought will drive home the message.", "Nta she's stealing", "NTA. You had an agreement - tell me about purchases in advance. Not only that, but when she found out you were going to confront her, rather than having that discussion with you sure used her younger brother as a distraction to go on a last big shopping spree. \nShe clearly has no respect for your rules or the value of money.", "NTA. Stop giving her your card. Lock it. Get rid of it. She is stealing from you and acting like a brat. Where is she getting the money to pay you back? \n\nAlso go with her and make her return these items.", "NTA, taking your credit card without permission, is stealing, no matter how your children want to slice it. Losing the car until the end of junior year is pretty minimal, considering you could have pressed charges and she would have had a record. Probably better she learns that lesson now instead of later when you won't be able to save her from consequences.", "NTA of course your kids are going to say you took it too far! The only opinion that matters here is your wife's so you're good.", "NTA, and your daughter is lucky that you don't report her for theft, because taking your credit card without permission is theft. \n\nAnything that she bought on Saturday that she is still in possession of - return the items, and make her pay for the rest.  If she takes your card again, or your car - report them stolen.", "Return amy purchases you can, and explain your card was taken without permission. \n\nShown your daughter what the legal punishment and ramifications actions are for fraud and credit card theft. \n\nExplain that as she not only manipulated her brother, lied to you, stole, and then insulted you for pulling her up on it. It is now time to get a job, pay off the balance, and no more credit card access. And now time for her to earn her own car.   Make sure the keys are out of reach, too. A few weeks walking or on a bus may show her the true cost of things.   She can be angry, but she can also be accountable..  I also ask why, when you knew she was going to do this, you didn't block your card.   I'd probably change your cards  or pin BTW.  \n\nTime to teach your daughter the value of money and that she is not entitled to others. She is currently acting like her actions will not have consequences.but the truth is, in the real world. She could get a criminal record and impact her future significantly. Nobody hires a thief and a liar.   You helped create this situation  now undo it for her benefit, even if she can't see why yet.", "ESH. It's clear that your daughter is wrong, but have you tried parenting? Laying down rules for credit card use? Taking away the credit card when she breaks the rules? What does your car have to do with anything? It's completely unrelated and it's just a bonus punishment because you're angry.", "How did she steal it without telling you when she\u2019s been using it over and over again and you allow her to pay it back? You may not like how she went about it on Snapchat, but be happy she\u2019s paying you back. Most parents don\u2019t ever see that money again. With that said, you absolutely had every right to take your card. As far as the car, you had a right to take it for her disrespecting you by calling you a dick, but not for her using your card since you\u2019ve allowed it.", "ESH\n\nYou should have taken the card away the very first time she used it without permission. She shouldn't be using the credit card without your permission. The \"You have until midnight\" shit was a little overboard and so is taking the car away from 8 months.", "Yta - I mean, take away that credit card ffs.  I could rant all day about how ridiculous it is to give a teenager a credit card.  How did you think that would end?  She's already learnt - better to ask forgiveness than make responsible decisions to begin with.  \n\nCar?  Eh, depends where you are and what it's like.  Taking away a car for me would be shooting myself in the foot with extra driving.  But if there's good access to public transport, then maybe.  \n\nTo summarise though, you created this situation... soooo...  change the script.  Set clear boundaries, stick to them.  You're reaping what you've sown right now.", "Reap what you sow. Your daughter sounds entitled af", "Ugh. ESH You should have taken the card away the first time she abused it.

Since she faced zero concequences it's not surprising she kept pushing your boundaries. Once she stole your credit card or car for a first time you should've given her some serious punishment.", "I'm leaning towards YTA.\n\nI would certainly take the credit card off her (maybe buy a cheap safe and put it in there if she keeps taking it without your permission), but I feel that taking the car off her is a bit too far. I understand it is your car, but it still feels like a bit of a harsh move as this has nothing to do with the car, so I don't see a reason to stop her from using it.\n\nI've noticed a lot of other comments saying that it is fair because it is theft. Whilst that is correct, my counter to that would be, do you want to be right or do you want to have a good relationship with your daughter? It might technically be theft, but I don't think this is the sort of thing you want to ruin your relationship with her over. She is 17. Legally she can get her own place at 18 and never see you again, so I'd be careful about being too tough. Plenty of people have ruined their relationship with their kids over lesser things than this. Taking away the credit card that was never hers for abusing it is fair and I think she'll recognize that.

It was in my name, so my credit got built up, and my dad would take it anytime i didn't make the payments each month, and keep it until i made the missed payment + the next one. I learned the value of credit, the importance of paying it down (og to have more to use, but the function transferred), etc. And the card is set to auto decline if i go over, so overdraft wasn't a risk.", "NTA at all. \n\nYour daughter is an entitled little -insert your favorite not nice word here- and she needs to get her wings trimmed a bit\u2014or a lot. \n\nYou\u2019ve been more than patient and caring.

That said, you really need to teach her to manage her finances and budget. Will she be moving out or going to college soon? If so, she needs to learn to spend practically because one day, she will be independent and have no one to fund her lavish spending. For instance, that $300 can be used to save on bulk household supplies, dry goods, etc that can last her months or a year. If she goes to university, it could cover her textbooks for the entire semester. She needs to learn the value of money. I'm in college and can buy groceries each week for $50 with some left over. $300 would buy me groceries for a month and a half (or even 2 months if needed).", "Her calling you a dick should get her car privileges revoked forever.
