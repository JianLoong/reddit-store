I'm glad you're taking this seriously, you just should have done so sooner.  Also anything she's bought that can be returned should be.  If it can't be returned lock it where she can't get it, donate it, or throw it away.  I think taking away what she bought will drive home the message.", "Nta she's stealing", "NTA.

Whilst that is correct, my counter to that would be, do you want to be right or do you want to have a good relationship with your daughter? It might technically be theft, but I don't think this is the sort of thing you want to ruin your relationship with her over. She is 17. Legally she can get her own place at 18 and never see you again, so I'd be careful about being too tough. Plenty of people have ruined their relationship with their kids over lesser things than this.

She committed a crime technically. Stick with the punishment though & do not give in before she does it ,or something worse, again.", "Why on earth didn\u2019t you make her immediately return the items?  NTA", "NTA play stupid games win stupid prizes. If I were you op, I would look into getting the app for your card and locking/freezing it any time you're not using it so if she steals it again it'll get declined. Granted, forgetting to unlock it is a pain in the butt and is a bit embarrassing but it's a 30 second fix to unlock it and then the app is open to lock it immediately after the transaction is done", "[removed]", "[removed]", "She stole the card and car.\n\nShe should be told she will soon be over the age of being tried in juvenile court.  And that a felony auto theft charge looks bad for employers and uni applications.", "I agree, I would be returning everything she bought.", "it's...it's his car not hers. he said she lost car privilege's not her own car", "Absolutely. Spoiled and remorseless.", "She stole the card that many times without dad doing anything about it? If my teen stole my card once, it would not be within their grasp again let alone 20 more times.\n\nShe also obviously had access to the car if dad revoked her privileges. Sounds to me like dad didn\u2019t say anything, let resentment build and blew up at her. Great parenting.", "Problem is she has stolen it before with no consequences. He also knew she was going to do this WELL in advance and waited until the day of to confront her? I wouldve cancelled that card, gotten another, and let her try to use the invalid card. Instead, she still go to shop. How about making her return the items to get the money back? Op is NTA for this but ded TA for not parenting better.", "It is the mindset of someone who has seen kids that moved out as soon as they were legally able to, because they had such a bad relationship with their parents that they felt like they didn't have much choice.\n\nI am certainly not saying using someone else's credit card without permission is okay, I'm just saying that I think the op went too far with the punishment and thus is risking ruining the relationship with their daughter."]}
