At one point me and my little sister (17) told her to stop drinking because she kept staggering by the pool and we didn\u2019t want her to hurt herself. however my dads very drunk fianc\u00e9 kept insisting that she was fine and she could have more. \n\nNow in the last year, i\u2019ve personally had really bad experiences whilst drinking, i wont bore you with the details but both included very drunk men and one even included the police.

Letting them get so drunk they can't walk straight us child abuse.\n\nGood on you for calling her out.", "NTA...They need to stop demanding an apology and start reflecting upon their own behaviour.", "NTA. Letting your little sister drink that much was incredibly irresponsible, and it seems like you used as much tact as possible.  What does your mom think of the whole thing? I'm pretty sure if I got my oldest drunk at that age her mother would have had a whole lot to say about it.", "NTA. Never apologize for protecting someone you love.", "NTA, anyone who willingly lets underage children drink until they are stumbling will always be the asshole. Its a parents responsibility to help teach their kids safety and important life lessons, not get shit faced. She needed to hear the truth and if she is the adult like she is implying then she can put her big girl panties on and hear the truth from someone (you) who sees her behavior often. Honestly, you stated it way nicer than I ever would have and I would absolutely love to have an older sister like you!!! Keep your siblings safe, even if you have to fight tooth and nail, because it seems you're the only one who cares enough for their future.", "NTA it\u2019s difficult being the only responsible person.  Good job!", "NTA. My family would practically pour vodka down my throat at age 14  because it made me more fun to hangout with. By the time I was 18 I was a borderline alcoholic, just because I had been so accustomed to constantly drinking. I\u2019m 27 now and have just gotten my alcohol consumption under control, but it did so much damage to my body. My brain didn\u2019t develop properly, some of my organs didn\u2019t develop properly. I was basically drunk for 13 years straight and had no idea how big of a problem it was because my family was so blas\u00e9 about it. It\u2019s been 6 months of only drinking a beer at dinner and I\u2019m realizing how different my body and brain feel without constant alcohol. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to make this about me or anything, I\u2019m just trying to give you an example of a young person in that situation that didn\u2019t have someone looking out for them. There\u2019s a reason young teens shouldn\u2019t drink. Good on you for saying something, you\u2019re potentially preventing her from a very challenging relationship with alcohol in adulthood. \n\nIf your almost step mom is not going to act like a responsible adult, she doesn\u2019t get to get upset when you do. And she especially doesn\u2019t get to get upset when you point out that she isn\u2019t y\u2019all\u2019s mother. If she wants that title, maybe act like a parent,", "NTA they could be arrested for giving a minor alcohol. They should be ashamed of themselves.", "Nta.", "I would say NTA but also that its might be worth swallowing your pride and apologizing to smooth it over. You can apologize for the 'not the parent' part without apologizing for wanting to stop your sister drinking. \n\nCan we ask what the situation is with you mum? It sounds like she either passed away or isn't on the scene in which case it seems like the fiance was being quite insensitive. It would be natural in either of those cases for you to be protective and take on a more responsible role in your sister's life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
