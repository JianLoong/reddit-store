A few months prior to this, my uncle asked me to be the photographer at his wedding as i had done it as a qualification. (me being the photographer is kind of relevant). \n\nDuring the wedding i made sure to only consume a little alcohol. not even enough for a buzz. so during the dinner i was completely sober. my dad and his fianc\u00e9 however, we\u2019re completely wasted. realistically speaking, i was the only sober person there (legal age to drink in the UK is 18). \n\nMy dads fianc\u00e9 kept allowing my 14 year old sister to drink. At one point me and my little sister (17) told her to stop drinking because she kept staggering by the pool and we didn\u2019t want her to hurt herself. however my dads very drunk fianc\u00e9 kept insisting that she was fine and she could have more. \n\nNow in the last year, i\u2019ve personally had really bad experiences whilst drinking, i wont bore you with the details but both included very drunk men and one even included the police. I\u2019m very cautious of my little sisters safety due to this as even though they have people around them to protect them (as did i at the time) something may still happen. \n\nTowards the end of the night my dads fianc\u00e9 told my little sister she could get another drink and i exploded a little. saying things like \u201cthat\u2019s your last one\u201d and \u201cwe aren\u2019t responsible for what happens to you if you carry on\u201d. My dads fianc\u00e9 turned around and basically said i wasn\u2019t her mother.

In fact they have to apologize to you, especially your awful stepmother needs to apologize.", "NTA - you\u2019re a very responsible person and looking out for people who really should know better", "You did nothing wrong. Your step mum needs to grow up and get her act together.  You are an amazing big sister. Your dad also needs to get his act together. He is responsible for all of you.", "NTA. Your sister is extremely lucky to have you. I know it's kinda awful to be the adult because others would make it seem like you're a kill joy but being responsible is a good thing. An advice one older sister to another, never feel bad for trying to protect your sister. She might not appreciate in the years to come but she will. Alcoholism is not a joke and so is alcohol poisoning. Make sure your sister understands that drinking alcohol isn't necessarily bad, as long as it is in moderation. \ud83d\udc99\ud83d\udc99", "Your dad's fiance isn't your parent, not legally. Remind her often. Without an official adoption, she's not even a real step parent even with marriage. I'm sure she wants to feel important,  but, the law doesn't care about her feelings. The fiance can't go to the hospital and help out in a medical emergency and a number of other things, whenever she's done, or wife, whatever she becomes, without adopting. Maybe speak with your father about setting boundaries for her if she wishes to join your family? All of this drama already sounds like major red flag territory. Also, I don't know if this is just because I'm a non-drinker/non-smoker and gave that up years ago for my children, but alcohol is usually the precipice for absolute nullification of any relationship/anything good period in life. The fact a 19 year old is being the deep thinking rational adult in this situation speaks volumes at high volumes.  I really don't see, especially as a 19 year old what, responsibility or loyalty, if any,  you actually have to this rando  alcoholic fling your Dad has manifested.. my two cents anyway", "NTA, your dad's fianc\u00e9 needs some therapy, she's not a fit parent in her current state. Being so defensive about it is worse still.", "Child services call right there.", "Besides, you did apologize in advance. So no need to do it again. I think your parents are just trying to retain their authority by asking an apology.", "Her brain is still developing.", "Yah, mostly, I feel sorry for OP to have to act like a parent. It sucks, I really hope it's a one time incident and for your stepmother, and father, to step up their parenting game. \n\nObviously, NTA.", "Going off by her other comments about the story, the step mother seems to be quite manipulative and already got into the youngest\u2019s head.", "Probably not. If it\u2019s at a private space or resident and it\u2019s given to the child by a parent it\u2019s legal. I think it has to be over the top, in public or multiple instances in order to receive a charge. \n\nI know it\u2019s legal in Texas if the child is at home and being supervised by a parent.

About 30% of kids will go out an get smashed at parties. \n\nTbh a bunch of kids are already smoking weed daily & doing pills (molly for the yanks). \n\nGetting a bit pissed isnt weird, the adult goading them into it... thats odd", "Your mum doesn't impress me.

That is beyond tragic--not only the premature loss of a young person, but for the continuing loop of bad decisions on the part of the father.", "Ewwww\u2026 that\u2019s disgusting.", "Exactly this. My uncle introduced my cousin to alcohol and heroin when he was 16. A few years ago my cousin died of an OD after a long sobriety.\n\nJust know, if you relapse your body cannot handle as many drugs as it used to, this is a very common way people OD.", "For their safety and your stepsister\u2019s safety, please fight for the custody of these children.

I had only met him a few times. He was out of prison and had turned his life around. We were so happy for him and proud of him being able to stay sober. I'm sure his mom, sister, and daughter were still worried though. I still think of him being alone and scared.", "NTA. WOW. This stepmom is abusing her Stepkid and Dad is okay with this.", "So she fed a child that is not her birthed daughter alcohol a 14 yo?? I would have been livid as y'all bio mom.

Drunk or not its not right and the father shouldn't have allowed this to continue 1 drink maybe but no way drunk. Nta at all at least you have sense. n sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. Good lookin out.", "NTA. Anyone who is giving you shit for protecting your little sister can F off. You did a good job and you stepped up when your dad and his fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t. Alcohol inhibits the rational part of your brain and therefore even they were in no state to parent. So their opinions, to me at least mean nothing. If anything they should be thanking you for stepping up and apologizing for getting that hammered. You\u2019re a great sister. I applaud you!", "As a survivor of abuse & sexual assault I applaud your strength and sensibility in protecting your sister. Your parents both suck.

So what if you kinda lost it on the very adult person feeding alcohol to your extremely young sister who'd clearly had enough for one night.", "NTA. Sad that you are the adult in your family. Any parent who encourages an underage drunk should be arrested for child endangerment. Dad\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is an idiot.", "NTA. I am super glad you were sober and looking after everyone. It shouldn't have all been on you.", "Wow, this is violently European \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "NTA\n\nBoth your stepmom and dad are negligent fucking assholes. My mother used to be a terrible drunk in my teen years, but never once encouraged me to drink. Ever. Your mom needs to step in and either say something to your dad or bring it up via court. Because make no mistake, if something had happen to your sister during this whole thing, CPS would be down his throat in a heartbeat hearing that his partner and him by default were encouraging a minor to drink and not stopping them.

I can\u2019t imagine the rage OP must\u2019ve felt seeing this happen to a literal teenager on top of her own past traumas.\n\nOP, you are 100% NTA. This was unacceptable behavior, and even though some people have come around since then, it\u2019s really disgusting that you were the only adult that took action to the issue that was unfolding in front of everybody.

She did end up single till she passed 4,5 years ago.", "I know when my parents pushed me into doing anything at that age it instantly became the one thing I *wouldn't* do.

But a kid fresh out of middle school? Super weird, unhealthy, child endangerment and neglect in fact.", "Oh, I overlooked that. Why is OP quoting the legal drinking age in the UK when this happens in Cyprus though? The UK law is completely irrelevant in Cyprus.", "A 14 year old having a drink at a celebration isn't unusual here. A 14 year old getting so drunk they can barely walk is uncommon.

Neither of those things are acceptable.\n\nWe're not all drunk, rowdy assholes, they just tend to be louder than the rest of us.", "Thank you. It's devistating. People don't realize (or don't care) that alcohol is a drug. You can overdose. It will affect a brain that is still developing in negative ways. Children cannot handle it in the same way adults can. Making it seem OK and cool to binge drink as a child can easily lead to binge drinking (or just nonstop) drinking as an adult. I'm not anti-alcohol. I'm anti kids drinking until they are tipsy, anti-binge drinking at any age. Moderation and waiting to drink until you are of legal age (ideally when the brain is fully formed) are key to safely enjoying alcohol.", "Maybe, but I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s allowed anyone under 10 to try alcohol. Nevermind get bladdered on it. This varies throughout Europe of course, but that\u2019s just my experience\n\nLikely it\u2019s such a low age because no matter what they set it as, you cannot enforce the law regarding drinking habits in private property", "The laws like that to help parents teach their children responsible drink without braking the law. However, if you have irresponsible parents, then you get irresponsible child drinking.", "I agree, but 5 year olds can barely make a drink for themselves, never-mind understand what alcohol is, its effects, and how to regulate it. That\u2019s mostly why I didn\u2019t use that reasoning to justify setting the law as low as 5"]}
