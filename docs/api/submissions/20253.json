A lot of people here forgot when they were 14 or are just lame ass Christians. She\u2019s right, you\u2019re not her mom and as far as the orderning goes this lady and your father are the ones in charge of them. She\u2019s just your sister and being sister doesn\u2019t override father as much as you want it to and you have no power here as you\u2019re a child yourself, the fact that he drank too much to handle the situation is on him not you and it\u2019s never been your job to parent your sister because they couldn\u2019t. In fact I\u2019d have to say that thing kinda of over protective for no reason behavior will only put a bigger rift in between you and her to the point that she won\u2019t come to you in confidence for anything as she has her own life and thoughts that don\u2019t align with yours obviously if your too uptight to even catch a buzz. which is a pretty big indicator of your biases towards drinking and when it\u2019s safe to do so. You took the situation and felt like it was your job to control other peoples behavior when god gave them free will to make their own decisions regardless of age. The fact that your parents suck doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your job to pick up the slack and I know it looks like you\u2019re doing the right thing but you\u2019re not and your only causing more problems as your parents will never clean up their act and she will never learn to avoid getting smashed here instead of a college frat down the road. When it\u2019s actually dangerous. If your sister is drinking at 14 I have a very big news flash for you, she doesn\u2019t give a shit what anyone thinks and she\u2019s going to drink and the only difference here is she actually is safe at a wedding surrounded by family and friends. Just because you had a bad experience at a house party at 17 doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll have the same experience if she drink three drinks and cuts lose during an event that\u2019s famous for kids taking their first drink.

I genuinely can\u2019t fathom why parents would ever think that\u2019s acceptable. It\u2019s one thing to let her have a drink but getting drunk is crossing a line, it falls under child abuse.
