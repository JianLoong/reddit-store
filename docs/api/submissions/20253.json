It depends on the environment, on the family, and on the kid.\n\nI've also never really seen someone be judged for not drinking, I was sober for a while and never had any trouble from anyone, but I'm sure it does happen.", "Yeah, it's genuinely not that I disagree with you. I don't think kids should be drinking. \n\nI've just seen so many young children get hurt/develop addictions/make really bad decisions because they were introduced to alcohol in crappy environments.\n\nWhile I think parents should absolutely try to discourage addiction/heavy drinking, a lot of people are going to do it anyways and I think it's better it's done with responsible adults around."]}
