Lots of people don\u2019t have their siblings. I actually had to reread because you\u2019re treating it like Nia wasn\u2019t even at the wedding - now THAT would be insulting. But just not having her as a bridesmaid? Doesn\u2019t deserve being treated like a pariah. \n\nThat said I don\u2019t know their relationship dynamic. Based on only what\u2019s posted in here - I think Nia is an asshole to not invite her (although she would never be an asshole for not offering to pay), but then again, it does seem like Ami is very antagonistic with the teasing so Nia isn\u2019t necessarily an asshole if the dynamic is toxic overall.

Maybe it was similar here, and Ami has essentially been trying to assert herself? Like she didn\u2019t want her sister as a bridesmaid because everything at home *already* revolves around her sister, and if she was bridesmaid then everything would have to revolve around her again since she\u2019s a teenager. \n\nHer disparaging comments and attempts to show how much more \u201cetiquette\u201d she has, while still rude, may be symptoms of her lashing out at her sister whom she perceived as responsible for ruining her own childhood, while simultaneously trying to grandstand in some misguided attempt to get attention and praise from her parents for once.\n\nObviously this is all speculation, we don\u2019t have enough evidence, but it\u2019s food for thought.
