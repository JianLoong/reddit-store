Doing that is in your child\u2019s best interest.\n\nIf you are in the USA, look into getting your son his own insurance plan off the ACA exchange (ie Obamacare).  I did this for my child for ABA therapy.  At the time, the top end silver plan was about $5k per year total out of pocket including both insurance premiums and deductible.  You can also apply for Medicaid.  As long as he needs help with daily living skills like eating, bathing, getting dressed, still in diapers, etc he should qualify.  Medicaid paid for anything related to ABA that wasn\u2019t covered by primary insurance (the Obamacare plan) including the deductible.  Then your employer provided insurance would be the third coverage.  Mix and match which one you use depending on which has the best benefit for what you need.  You could also skip the Obamacare plan and just do Medicaid, but it may have additional restrictions on what you can do if you go that route.", "ESH\n\nNo way that it costs $800 a month to feed a 3 year old (or $1600 a month if you feel that he would be paying his 'fair' share at $800 a month and you would fund the other $800).\n\nThe extremely expensive therapy seems like something you chose to do based on what you think is best and I don't think that the other parent who seems to get no say in this can be expected to contribute anything to it. Does healthcare insurance not pay for this therapy? Then perhaps this is because it's not prescribed/not medically indicated/not evidence-based and then you shouldn't expect anyone else to contribute towards this.\n\nIt's irrelevant what the average child support payment is where you live. Child support would be calculated based on all kinds of factors that are specific to your individual situation and your ex partner's situation. You can't look at statistics for your region or at friends who receive child support to come up with some number you think you should be getting.\n\nIt sounds like whatever informal arrangement you two have right now is not working so it's probably time to take this to court to get them to do the formal calculations and then see what they come up with. Note that the father might be interested in more custody so you should also be willing to discuss this. If he wants 50% custody he should get that if he can provide safe housing and is around enough, and in such a case he probably wouldn't have to pay you any child support as he would be doing his fair share by having 50% custody.\n\nI do think you should really re-think all the expenses you make for what you think his therapy/medical/dietary needs (or wants) are and talk to your healthcare insurance. If they aren't covering it it might be because it's not proven to be effective or the therapy isn't indicated for your child/your child's condition. As a parent you could decide your child benefits from weekly massages and school tutoring and expensive hobbies like horse riding or private music lessons or holiday weeks away at art camp, but those things are luxuries. You are more than welcome to spend as much of your OWN money on your child as you like but you can't expect the father to cover 50% of those luxury expenses that YOU choose to purchase for your child. Would you cover 50% of any expense he might choose to make for your child that you get no say in? Maybe when the child is older the father feels the child needs a $50k car. Are you happy for him to send you a bill to cover the $25k that is half of this car that he could argue would be your fair share? This is of course a clear example of a luxury item and whatever therapy and special food you now buy might be somewhat of a need and somewhat of a luxury, but I think you are wrong in presenting these as an absolute need that the father has to contribute to. And if you expect him to pay for 50% of these kinds of costs, he should get an equal say into how this money is spent so he might suggest a different kind of therapy or different kind of food, etc.\n\nGood luck with this. Please follow the formal paths for this.", "Geez Louise. PottyTrain that kid. \ud83d\ude44 That would be one less bill to pay.", "Against the grain I guess, but YTA.

Because whatever you are awarded will be back owed from birth. So he'll be in debt right away for not supporting your son equally. Go after him.", "Lucky? Nope take it to the courts. Choosing to have a kid is a choice. Now you both have obligations. Courts should decide what he can afford. I\u2019m never a fan of keeping out of the courts and just paying out of pocket. Too many what ifs.", "NTA. Get CS through the system.

Child support for one thousand years!\n\nOr at least until the court determines that your son no longer requires support, and as much as the court will award.", "NTA", "You're not the lucky one, he is. Because you've been happy with half the average child support. You're not lucky to get child support, HE SHOULD BE SUPPORTING HIS KID. \n\nAbsolutely go to court. If you get $1200 a month and don't need it (though from your breakdown you actually need more), you can put the extra money in a 529 or other savings program. Especially if your son will need increased care beyond age 18. \n\nWhen you get the full amount from the court - because they to give it to you - use the full amount for your son and then take your money you are spending now to increase your savings AND contribute to a retirement account for yourself.

You are putting your child through torture, as ABA is. Forget the cost, where is coming from.

You can go to your local DHS or Child Support office and fill out the paperwork to start a case. They will handle the rest.", "NTA.  You have to think of what is best for your child.

The legal minimums for child support are never generous. If he's payimg less than that, then it's clearly inadequate. There are usually calculators online that let you work out your entitlement, use one of those, offer him one chance to voluntarily match it, then go to court.", "I totally think he should be splitting everything with you so NTA but how on earth are you spending $350/month on wipes and diaps? That makes no sense. Even $100 would be high but more, uh, realistic.

Saying that the type they practice is different or that just bc it didn\u2019t work for you doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t work for their child, really sucks. \n\nIf someone was in here claiming that conversion therapy for their gay child was working, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed. But bc it\u2019s disabled people, it\u2019s not only acceptable, ppl who are autistic speaking against it, get downvoted. This is what will happen to us and probably OP will be pretty annoyed that we\u2019ve dared to speak up as autistic people. However the autistic community is pretty much agreed on this. ABA in all forms is bad. Idc if non autistic people think it\u2019s a good thing.  The only ppl claiming it\u2019s good are parents and therapists.

Through ABA, he was able to learn how to eat, play with others, and is now talking and able to ask for things (which he wasn\u2019t able to before). ABA is not for everyone, but this article heavily does not relate to how ABA is done at my son\u2019s clinic. He learns through play and is able to build the skills that he needs to become more self sufficient. Sorry if ABA didn\u2019t work for you, but I posted this to ask about child support, not about whether ABA was right for my son. Also, you should remeber that autism is spectrum. Everyone with autism is different and ABA does not work for everyone. But comparing dog training to ABA , is extremely wrong because that is not at all what they do.", "Just because it didn\u2019t work for you doesn\u2019t mean doesn\u2019t work for others. And the opinions of a dog trainer on human development are irrelevant.", "I work in an ABA clinic that\u2019s mission is to give trauma informed and assent based care. I work with multiple autistic ABA therapists. ABA has a history of abusive practices that are still practiced in many clinics today. That is obviously very, very wrong. Compliance based therapy is not right. Stim blocking is not right, neither is escape extinction, forced eye contact, forced feeding therapy ect. But not all clinics practice that type of ABA, and many clinics including the one I work at explicitly have policies preventing that type of treatment. Making a blanket statement that ALL ABA is harmful is not true. It can be life saving for some autistic individuals.", "The child will absolutely need additional funds as they grow up to support increasing needs, so the suggestion to put some in savings is an excellent idea.\n\n(My parents were not poor but not wealthy, and my brother has autism\u2026 they spent loads of money as he grew up on medications and therapy and it never got any cheaper.)", "Yes! I already have documents from his developmental pediatrician and his medical evaluation through the state about his need for ABA!", "This isn\u2019t only about expenses, it\u2019s the total cost of having a special needs child. By law, the father should have to pay child support especially if he\u2019s as deadbeat at he is. My mom and dad had 50/50 custody of me when I was a kid, and my dad still payed my mom child support, so even if they did have joint custody that doesn\u2019t mean he shouldn\u2019t be paying it. I\u2019d suggest not gaslighting OP into thinking she\u2019s doing the wrong thing choosing a more expensive therapy for her son, which has helped him live a better life, when she is LEGALLY entitled to more than enough money from the dad to compensate for it. And if you really think that (I\u2019m thinking American) healthcare covers ANYTHING, you\u2019re living on a different planet. Therapies that are proven to work aren\u2019t always covered fully, even with private insurance. Saying the dad, the other PARENT of the child has no obligation to contribute towards a therapy that is working for the child and actively managing his condition well, when the dad has more than enough money to do so is a dick thing to say. If the dad didn\u2019t want to help care for a child he should have wrapped it up, so he should absolutely be paying the price for being irresponsible.", "My son has autism and potty training is not easy.

Mines 15, and still needs diapers sometimes.", "This is one of the most uneducated, uncalled for, and rudest comments I've seen and this is AITA so that should tell you something. Your comment is, frankly, outrageous. You obviously have zero experience with special needs children.

The fact that he's autistic and has so much going on means it is more than reasonable that he's not quite there, yet. He'll get there in time with your support and lack of judgment.
