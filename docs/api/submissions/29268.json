But I just checked her grades today and she\u2019s failing one of her classes with about 10 missing assignments. Now I\u2019ve given her so many chances to fix her grade in this one class. I\u2019ve tried everything. I got her multiple tutors and she didn\u2019t like any of them, I tried taking her phone, I even tried telling her her cat (that we recently took in from the street) was going to be rehomed if she didn\u2019t pull it together. But still, no change. So I told her she wasn\u2019t going to homecoming and she just lost it. She ran up to her room crying and slammed her door. Later when she came back out she refused to talk to me and refused to eat her dinner. She was being extremely rude to her father and siblings and when I called her out on it and asked her what her problem was she started yelling at me about how all I do is \u201ctake away her chance to have fun and a normal social life.\u201d I honestly thought she was overreacting quite a bit but now I\u2019m having second thoughts.", "created_utc": 1697753718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bvamq/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_to_homecoming/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that you\u2019ve gone to such extremes and it hasn\u2019t worked is a pretty clear indicator that it\u2019s not a lack of motivation on her end, but something she genuinely struggles with.", "Okay, so she's not turning in assignments for one class. You've tried quite a lot and nothing has solved the problem. But you also said it's only a problem in one class. There's likely more to the story. You need to figure out what's going on there. She might be having trouble that punishment and tutors can't solve. I had the same problem with one class, in high school, and my underlying problem was severe anxiety. Lecturing, getting angry, punishing, everything my mother did, made the anxiety worse - any time I had to write a paper, or be around her, it set me off. I had to cut off contact with her before I could succeed at college. I'm working towards my PhD and even 19 years after I last saw her, I still have anxiety about my papers. I've developed several for skills for working through it, but my life would be a lot better if she had built trust, instead of imploding the relationship and calling it the natural consequences of my actions.\n\nRegardless, if nothing else has worked to get her to finish and turn in assignments, then taking away a homecoming dance isn't likely to work, either. As a parent, you might decide that you need to stick to your original decision, and that's perfectly understandable - consequences are a thing, and all. But don't expect it to solve the problem.\n\nRe-home her cat?? Yeah, big YTA there, just for that. Subjecting  an innocent animal, and your child, to that level of emotional harm, as punishment for grades in one class? No, that's... that's definitely not going to improve her grades. The most likely result there is a negative impact on her grades across the board and, at best, a strained relationship with her for the rest of your life. Just by making the threat, you've caused relational damage that you likely can't come back from. If I were her, I would, at minimum, never allow my mother into my home as an adult. People who make threats like that tend to view pets as objects, and I would never again be able to trust that my pets would be safe around that person.\n\nIf you want her to improve her grade, you need to find out what's going on that she's struggling to turn in assignments, and since you've already ruined any trust she had in you with the whole cat thing, you're probably going to want to ask someone else to talk with her about it - perhaps an aunt or an older cousin she feels safe with, or a teacher of a different subject, that she really connects well with.", "I may have sided with you until you started threatening to give away her cat. \n\nI can't wait until you show up here later crying about how your kid hates you. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\n'I even tried telling her her cat (that we recently took in from the street) was going to be rehomed if she didn\u2019t pull it together.'\n\nDo you honestly think that's even remotely motivating?

Why don't the tutors work? What is the issue? Is this class super important or is it one she can drop at some point?\n\nTake away an important social event like homecoming and you're also taking away some of that motivation to show up at school.

They only had homecoming their senior year. \nThey were failing because of social anxiety and failure to turn in their assignments correctly.\n\nEdit to add:\nIt\u2019s not laziness. It\u2019s more likely executive dysfunction such as ADHD. \nI still struggle with staying on task, completing tasks, motivation to do anything etc, etc. Therapy, medication, coping mechanisms help me function better. \nPlease get your child evaluated. There is something going on, and they need to strategies and tools to help her be her best self. \nTake care.", "INFO why was she failing this specific class? Is it a subject she doesnt like?

Thats borderline psychological abuse you know.", "YTA\nThere are 100 ways to go about falling classes, from what you said it\u2019s one class out of i am assuming 4 or 5. If she was falling all of her classes and there were a ton of missing assignments in more then one class that is a big deal. But from what it sounds like it\u2019s one class where she is obviously struggling and it\u2019s probably either because she doesn\u2019t like the subject and it\u2019s difficult, or there is a problem between her and the teacher. I have failed a class in grade 11 and it was because it was a hard class and the teacher was horrible, the next semester I just took the class again with a different teacher and passed. \nYou threatening to take away her phone, and rehoming your cat is absolutely not going to help. And the cat thing is a completely different issue you should never get an animal without committing to take care of it for it\u2019s life. \nShe is probably really struggling with the fact that she is falling a class, it is not easy knowing that you are falling behind and failing something. What she needs from you right now is support, not threats.\nYou should let her go to homecoming and apologize, you are definitely TA", "YTA\n\nShe's failing one class. Not all of them. If she really was \"lazy\" like you keep repeating in your comments, I doubt she'd be passing those other classes.\n\nThere is obviously something underlying here as to why she's failing this one class and threatening her cat and removing something that twice already she hasnt been able to go to isn't going to help.", "YTA. You waited until now to check the grades and bludgeon her with not being able to go to Homecoming? Has she failed the class before? Because it sounds very strange that it's mid October you would have had that many tutors, and that many missing assignments.

School grades are not all that matter in life. Let her be a kid and go to the first homecoming that she has had a chance to. Jeez.", "Yes YTA. My parents did the same thing to me and and i literally had a B. Instead of going to homecoming, they said I needed to stay home and study Latin (the class). I had already bought the ticket with my own money and had the dress I was gonna wear. I even had plans with people to go with, but all of that was taken away because of some power trip. Also, extra fucked up that you threatened her cat. YTA for sure and I would be just as pissed and irritable as her. I\u2019m in college now and I still wish I had not missed that dance because I sat in my room and cried myself to sleep that night. I sat in my room cried and had no one to talk to and in the end, I ended up with an A in the class anyway. I understand wanting to create incentives to do better but taking away something she has been looking forward to since before the grades is cruel.", "What is she going to learn from not going to a school dance? To work harder? Be more organized? Prepare better? Follow up more closely? This seems unreasonable and not a true consequence for her inability to either do the work or turn it in.\n\nWhat are YOU doing to help her? Do you check in on her homework every night?

Threats only create division. Work WITH her to solve this.

We expect teens to just do these things but some need more guidance than others. \n\nPersonally unless you had previously tied homecoming to grades (if you do not complete all your assignments on time you aren\u2019t going, or something like that) then taking it away now is unfair. \n\nThreatening to rehome the cat is low.

She\u2019ll miss more later just out of spite and frustration. You need to work with her not against her. Is it actually laziness? Is she doing the work but not turning it in?

I honestly didn't think much of my note to her \u2013 I was just trying to do a small, thoughtful, and kind thing for someone who was, I imagined, under some stress \u2013 but she was apparently so deeply touched by it that she told all sorts of people about it. I was stunned; I really didn't expect it to mean that much to her, but she had been working so hard behind the scenes, and so to have someone say, in effect, 'I *see* you, I *see* how much you are doing, I *see* how important your work is, it may be behind the scenes, but it isn't invisible and it is appreciated' meant a lot to her. Seeing people, seeing what they do, seeing how they try \u2013 it can mean the world.", "Guessing OP thinks she shouldn't congratulate daughter doing what she's supposed to", "I always wonder how different people educate kids and animals. Kids are not no animals! But the human brain works not that differently to those of more intelligent animals when it comes to learning.\n\n\nWith dogs, cats and horses, which I train, it's always \"pray them, reward them. Correct them instantly, it's way harder and unpleasant for all, if you let it go now and try to teach a different behavior later.\"\n\nAnd with kids it's \"they don't need praying all the time, they know what to do. Punishments can be totally different and incoherent to what they did, even days later. (ok, kids and teens can remember what they did and can link but you get what I mean). Let kids be kids, they will learn it later in life.\"\nAnd with kids you can ... Talk!? They are able to tell you why they did something and you can teach them, why it's wrong, or why you want them to do something.", "I bet OP is one of those parents who constantly ask how student xy scored in the test and why you didn't score as high as them. But if xy didn't score as well as you, they say \"Well, you wouldn't jump down a bridge if xy does it, would you?\" (that's a very common phrase german parents use against their kids, I don't know if there is something similar in English).", "With all due respect, are you f*ing serious? What the hell is wrong with people", "Shes not considering getting rid of the cat because she dislikes a cat in her home. Shes solely considering it to emotionally punish her daughter. \n\nAlso, once a parent agrees to let a pet into the home, that's it. Unless someone develops a severe allergy or the animal has unexpected dangerous behavior issues, there is no excuse to treat a living animal like an old navy tshirt that you can take to the thrift store when you're tired of it.", "You're an asshole too. The fact you don't understand why is sad to me.", "Your parents should have rehomed you when U were still  in the womb!", "IMO the fact a high schooler is pouting, not eating dinner and basically throwing a tantrum like a 6 year old says a lot about the parenting that has been going on.", "Nope! It\u2019s the mom\u2019s issue for doling out emotionally abusive consequences and it will also be her issue when she no longer has a daughter.", "The consequence of failing a class is failing a class and being held back or kicked out. Not having a companion forcibly removed from you.", "So in other words. No, you haven\u2019t asked and got into what the issue is. \n\nIf someone uses laziness without further explanation into the issue, it tends to mean they didn\u2019t care to think into the issue too much since it would cause a change in opinion.", "There\u2019s no such thing as laziness. I was SO bad in one class in 12th grade, like VERY low grades. I just couldn\u2019t understand/process it, no matter how hard I tried, and the teacher was not helping (not checking \u201cbad\u201d students work when they tried kind of not helping). So at some point I decided that I\u2019d just stop trying since I was getting the same grades regardless.  I was not lazy, more like \u2026 done? \nTaking stuff away is certainly not gonna help, there\u2019s a reason why she\u2019s giving up on that one class, \u201cbeing lazy\u201d is not it, try asking what is the problem and listening to her? And the cat\u2026 really?? \nLet her go to the dance.\nYTA", "Sounds like it could be an issue in confidence in it. If her other classes are so easy but she\u2019s struggling in that one, she may be developing a mindset of \u201cThis subject is my enemy and I need to avoid it.\u201d I was a teen once and I was there. Have you considered the option of possibly talking to her without threats or punishments?", "Sounds like me. Turns out I had a learning disability and likely ADHD. I had a teacher tell me I was wasting her time and decided that school wasn't worth being ridiculed over by adults and dropped out.", "It sounds like maybe she got behind and is now overwhelmed because she\u2019s dug herself into a whole and can\u2019t get out. She sounds like she needs help, not more punishment. Tutors are great and can help a lot but unless you have found one that can meet with her everyday it won\u2019t be enough.she needs help and support and the one person who\u2019s supposed to be there to provide that is doling out unfair punishments, blaming her and calling her lazy. Do better.", "100% agree. I grew up in an extremely authoritarian household and \u201cconsequences\u201d would be applied at random with seemingly no relation to the alleged problem. I missed out on so many core childhood experiences because I would do something minor and then my parents would decide that I couldn\u2019t go on the senior trip because I didn\u2019t make my bed. Consequences are rarely fair or motivating.", "A lot of parents don't get this. If you make discipline transactional, the lesson becomes \"this is happening because I did or didn't do blank\" vs \"this is happening because Mom or dad is angry.\"", "A tutor did nothing for me. Tutors do not work for everyone. Failing one class shouldn't mean she doesn't get to go to homecoming when she's likely spent the last two to three years in online schooling because of COVID. Is that wanting a normal social life comment of hers? That's something I've heard a lot of teenagers say due to having to do their schooling online and not being able to socially interact like people used to before lockdown.", "Not everything is a disability. Laziness in teenagers is actually quite common for subjects they don\u2019t care about. It\u2019s one thing to not know how to do an assignment. It\u2019s another thing not even to submit 10 assignments", "Yup!  And taking away a dopamine event like homecoming is only going to make things worse!\n\nDon't get me started on the cat threat", "Learning that people with ADHD don't get the same dopamine reward that NTs do for completing tasks was absolutely revolutionary for me, and it's what made me push and shout until someone listened to me because I just *knew* that was me.\n\nSpoiler alert: I have, in fact, had ADHD the whole time.", "This. In elementary school, my most hated subject (other than math) was language arts. Now, it was probably my best subject, but I HATED my classwork in that subject. I didn't know it then, but I was exceptionally good at grammar. But most of the assignments in the textbook involved copying down sentences from the book. And I hated ANYTHING that involved copying down sentences, notes, etc. It wasn't challenging and was a waste of time to me and cramped my hand in the process. I somehow managed to push through it, miraculously. But I struggled with other variations of that. It was no fun being a smart kid with ADD and I so often frustrated my teachers and parents.", "I really want to say worse things but I think I\u2019ll be banned. But, yes, I agree with this assessment.", "Pets, once you take them into your home, are a lifetime commitment, not a \u201cprivilege\u201d you can take a way as a petty punishment.", "That was my mom: \"You got a 95? What happened to the other 5 points? How are you going to ever get a good job?\" Each and every time for my entire school career until college.", "Tudor = a English dynasty\n\nTutor = to teach or guide usually individually in a special subject or for a particular purpose", "Pretty much every school these days posts your kids grades online.  If a parent doesn't know what their kids are doing in school, it's on the parents.", "Definitely, has OP actually tried to figure out *why* the daughter is failing this subject or has OP just gone straight to punishment. OP you can\u2019t solve a problem without identifying the cause.", "This. That was my first question too, if she\u2019s doing okay in the rest of her classes and this is the only she seems to be struggling with there\u2019s likely a reason", "Sounds like my dad", "I have ADHD,  so my Dopamin level is a bit...unbalanced. Whenever I got the tiniest bit of praise in one class, I got sooooo Dopamin. You can probably guess that I was very motivated in those classes. Other classes only \"worked\" because my teacher and mother scared me (and it's funny how similar my mother and OP were regarding their punishments). I hated myself in those classes, and I didn't lose that feeling ten years after my graduation. \n\nSo yeah, the best way to teach me is how you would train a dog.", "What's wrong with you? You didn't give me an explanation.\n\nIt's not her daughter's right to have a cat. It's a privilege. I think you're forgetting who's the parent here.", "Why? Because I believe in discipline and basic parental rights?", "i mean yea how else is a teen going to react to their parent consistently punishing them for doing bad in a class they probably just genuinely struggle with", "I just came here to mention adhd!! Your daughter sounds a lot like me in school and I just recently got a diagnosis", "Exactly i had the same problem, everyone thought it was laziness but i found out as an adult i have adhd. It's just hard to focus and i forget easily but when i would try to explain i was told i was lazy. Adhd presents differently in those born female that they don't always meet the same criteria for \"classic adhd\" they don't check all the boxes so many either get diagnosed later in life or not at all. This could be what it is.", "There's no such thing as laziness. There's always a reason someone can't or won't do something they don't want to do.

That was wrong. Everything else was fine", "\ud83e\udd2e I am so sorry that you had to endure that", "*an English dynasty", "Yep. Mine too.", "Because it's fucked up to threaten your child with the removal of a beloved pet for something like grades. It would do more harm than good. It also shows that OP doesn't even view the cat as anything more than a means to control her daughter.", "It's a living breathing animal that she made a commitment to treat as a pet and make part of her family?  Abandoning an animal is atrocious.", "Go to sleep, dude", "Do you understand the psychological impact of having a pet pass away or run away? It's awful. Now think about if the person who was supposed to be the one safe space for you, who is supposed to raise you to be a decent human, shows you they can't be one by tossing your pet out like trash over a small dispute.

Again, it's her house, her cat, her rules.\n\n\"Tis better to be feared than loved.\"", "A) She didn't say they would abandon it.

I hope my sister does as well", "Not necessarily, she may not have been \u201crefusing\u201d to eat as much as just didn\u2019t feel like eating.

She's throwing other people (tutors) and insane punishments at the problem instead of doing her job as a parent by personally assisting her daughter in addressing the grades issue.  \n  \nYou and OP would rather just call the kid lazy as a cop-out than actually engage with the problem to find a solution.", "Yeah, you\u2019re right. If you hate your children it\u2019s better for them to fear you than love you. That way they won\u2019t ever talk to you again ever the second they\u2019re independent.", "Yeah.....in the olden days too much fear got you killed......now a days it's called no contact!!!!", "Using a pet as blackmail like OP did indicates that she didn't think or give a shit about how being rehomed suddenly would affect the cat, nevermind her own daughter. Which makes her an asshole.", "How it would affect the cat? Mate, it's an f*ing cat for crying out loud. They're rehoming it, not killing it. It'll survive.

I mean there\u2019s definitely people like that but how in the world is the teacher supposed to give you enough class time to do a whole report? When are they supposed to teach you?", "You boxing urself into lazy is fine and all but keep that for yourself. As a former \u201cgifted\u201d kid feeling burnt out I try not to use the word lazy with myself or others. It does more harm than good. \n\nAs for the homework thing\u2026 I also did next to no homework for certain classes sophomore year and beyond. Why? cuz if I thought it was a waste of time I wouldn\u2019t do it but I made a deal with my teachers that if I did well on tests that they would apply the same grade to hw assignments. I liked English so I did the work there but i didn\u2019t have to. And I also did homework during free period/ that same class regardless if I was given time/other classes while I listened to whatever I was supposed to learn in that subject.
