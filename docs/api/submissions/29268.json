But I just checked her grades today and she\u2019s failing one of her classes with about 10 missing assignments. Now I\u2019ve given her so many chances to fix her grade in this one class. I\u2019ve tried everything. I got her multiple tutors and she didn\u2019t like any of them, I tried taking her phone, I even tried telling her her cat (that we recently took in from the street) was going to be rehomed if she didn\u2019t pull it together. But still, no change. So I told her she wasn\u2019t going to homecoming and she just lost it. She ran up to her room crying and slammed her door. Later when she came back out she refused to talk to me and refused to eat her dinner. She was being extremely rude to her father and siblings and when I called her out on it and asked her what her problem was she started yelling at me about how all I do is \u201ctake away her chance to have fun and a normal social life.\u201d I honestly thought she was overreacting quite a bit but now I\u2019m having second thoughts.", "created_utc": 1697753718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bvamq/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_to_homecoming/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that you\u2019ve gone to such extremes and it hasn\u2019t worked is a pretty clear indicator that it\u2019s not a lack of motivation on her end, but something she genuinely struggles with.", "Okay, so she's not turning in assignments for one class. You've tried quite a lot and nothing has solved the problem. But you also said it's only a problem in one class. There's likely more to the story. You need to figure out what's going on there. She might be having trouble that punishment and tutors can't solve. I had the same problem with one class, in high school, and my underlying problem was severe anxiety. Lecturing, getting angry, punishing, everything my mother did, made the anxiety worse - any time I had to write a paper, or be around her, it set me off. I had to cut off contact with her before I could succeed at college. I'm working towards my PhD and even 19 years after I last saw her, I still have anxiety about my papers. I've developed several for skills for working through it, but my life would be a lot better if she had built trust, instead of imploding the relationship and calling it the natural consequences of my actions.\n\nRegardless, if nothing else has worked to get her to finish and turn in assignments, then taking away a homecoming dance isn't likely to work, either. As a parent, you might decide that you need to stick to your original decision, and that's perfectly understandable - consequences are a thing, and all. But don't expect it to solve the problem.\n\nRe-home her cat?? Yeah, big YTA there, just for that. Subjecting  an innocent animal, and your child, to that level of emotional harm, as punishment for grades in one class? No, that's... that's definitely not going to improve her grades. The most likely result there is a negative impact on her grades across the board and, at best, a strained relationship with her for the rest of your life. Just by making the threat, you've caused relational damage that you likely can't come back from. If I were her, I would, at minimum, never allow my mother into my home as an adult. People who make threats like that tend to view pets as objects, and I would never again be able to trust that my pets would be safe around that person.\n\nIf you want her to improve her grade, you need to find out what's going on that she's struggling to turn in assignments, and since you've already ruined any trust she had in you with the whole cat thing, you're probably going to want to ask someone else to talk with her about it - perhaps an aunt or an older cousin she feels safe with, or a teacher of a different subject, that she really connects well with.", "I may have sided with you until you started threatening to give away her cat. \n\nI can't wait until you show up here later crying about how your kid hates you. \n\nYTA", "YTA.\n\n'I even tried telling her her cat (that we recently took in from the street) was going to be rehomed if she didn\u2019t pull it together.'\n\nDo you honestly think that's even remotely motivating?

Why don't the tutors work? What is the issue? Is this class super important or is it one she can drop at some point?\n\nTake away an important social event like homecoming and you're also taking away some of that motivation to show up at school.

Please, let her go.\nOne of my kids missed homecoming their freshman due to a failing grade per school policy. That spring the pandemic started. No school events for nearly 2 years. They only had homecoming their senior year. \nThey were failing because of social anxiety and failure to turn in their assignments correctly.\n\nEdit to add:\nIt\u2019s not laziness. It\u2019s more likely executive dysfunction such as ADHD. \nI still struggle with staying on task, completing tasks, motivation to do anything etc, etc. Therapy, medication, coping mechanisms help me function better. \nPlease get your child evaluated. There is something going on, and they need to strategies and tools to help her be her best self. \nTake care.", "INFO why was she failing this specific class? Is it a subject she doesnt like?

Thats borderline psychological abuse you know.", "YTA\nThere are 100 ways to go about falling classes, from what you said it\u2019s one class out of i am assuming 4 or 5. If she was falling all of her classes and there were a ton of missing assignments in more then one class that is a big deal. But from what it sounds like it\u2019s one class where she is obviously struggling and it\u2019s probably either because she doesn\u2019t like the subject and it\u2019s difficult, or there is a problem between her and the teacher. I have failed a class in grade 11 and it was because it was a hard class and the teacher was horrible, the next semester I just took the class again with a different teacher and passed. \nYou threatening to take away her phone, and rehoming your cat is absolutely not going to help. And the cat thing is a completely different issue you should never get an animal without committing to take care of it for it\u2019s life. \nShe is probably really struggling with the fact that she is falling a class, it is not easy knowing that you are falling behind and failing something. What she needs from you right now is support, not threats.\nYou should let her go to homecoming and apologize, you are definitely TA", "YTA\n\nShe's failing one class. Not all of them. If she really was \"lazy\" like you keep repeating in your comments, I doubt she'd be passing those other classes.\n\nThere is obviously something underlying here as to why she's failing this one class and threatening her cat and removing something that twice already she hasnt been able to go to isn't going to help.", "YTA. You waited until now to check the grades and bludgeon her with not being able to go to Homecoming? Has she failed the class before? Because it sounds very strange that it's mid October you would have had that many tutors, and that many missing assignments.

School grades are not all that matter in life. Let her be a kid and go to the first homecoming that she has had a chance to. Jeez.", "Yes YTA. My parents did the same thing to me and and i literally had a B. Instead of going to homecoming, they said I needed to stay home and study Latin (the class). I had already bought the ticket with my own money and had the dress I was gonna wear. I even had plans with people to go with, but all of that was taken away because of some power trip. Also, extra fucked up that you threatened her cat. YTA for sure and I would be just as pissed and irritable as her. I\u2019m in college now and I still wish I had not missed that dance because I sat in my room and cried myself to sleep that night. I sat in my room cried and had no one to talk to and in the end, I ended up with an A in the class anyway. I understand wanting to create incentives to do better but taking away something she has been looking forward to since before the grades is cruel.", "What is she going to learn from not going to a school dance? To work harder? Be more organized? Prepare better? Follow up more closely? This seems unreasonable and not a true consequence for her inability to either do the work or turn it in.\n\nWhat are YOU doing to help her? Do you check in on her homework every night?

Threats only create division. Work WITH her to solve this.

We expect teens to just do these things but some need more guidance than others. \n\nPersonally unless you had previously tied homecoming to grades (if you do not complete all your assignments on time you aren\u2019t going, or something like that) then taking it away now is unfair. \n\nThreatening to rehome the cat is low.

She\u2019ll miss more later just out of spite and frustration. You need to work with her not against her. Is it actually laziness? Is she doing the work but not turning it in? Does she not understand the subject, or not understand why it\u2019s important? IS it actually important?\n\nETA Other than the tutors, what tools have you given her to help?

You fail to mention what you've done to help in this subject beyond tutors.  That seems really low effort, just like your daughter's efforts in this class.  Have you talked to her about why she's not turning in her assignments?  Something happening in the classroom? Why didn't she like the tutors? Helping her do her homework?   Meeting with the teacher to get his/her thoughts and suggestions?  What exactly have you done to set her up for success?  Let her go to homecoming.  Have a talk about what she thinks would help her in this class.  Then follow through and help her with this class.", "YTA.

I remember when I was in school, I had a friend that once got a B+ in ONE subject and an A+ on all others and her parents grounded her. It was rly sad. \n\nHeck if I got all Bs and even a C here and there, my parents would buy me ice cream. My father actually told me once \"you have to study and learn the basics, but have fun, coz you wont uae all of this and it will get worse late lol\".\n\nI mean, it can be a difference in countries though. In mine, your school grade dont matter at all for anything else after highschool. We do tests to enter free college, so my terrible grades in history did absolutely nothing to prevent me into gettibg into college to study biology.", "I think she'll wait until she's little older frankly.

Get your average up to passing (even if that means a D average)by Thanksgiving and we'll do *special thing she'd love*...she's in a deep hole and can't just jump out of it - work with her to build a ladder that she can climb up in smaller steps.", "The problem is that taking away homecoming isn't going to give your daughter the motivation to do better in school. You could just let her have fun and work with her on the class the next day. Plus not letting her go to homecoming shows that her passing her other classes doesn't matter so she might not try in those classes anymore. Get a tutor, get her diagnosed for a learning disability.

She's also allowed to have feelings and be mad about the situation. \n\nYTA", "Yeah, speaking as someone who struggled through school with undiagnosed ADHD, it sounds like your daughter's in the same boat. It's extremely difficult for us to actively focus on and complete tasks we find boring. We don't get the same neurochemical rewards other people do for such tasks. Then when neurotypical adults look at is we seem to be \"lazy\" and they try to punish us out of it- which is like scolding someone hard of hearing for being too \"lazy\" to listen to the teacher, and taking away the fun happy things in their life until they shape up and hear better.\n\nGetting a kid diagnosed and treated is more difficult and requires more effort than insulting and punishing them for having a disability- but it does have the advantage of helping to solve the actual problem.", "Calling her lazy is super not helpful. Have you gotten her assessed for a learning disability or brought her to the pediatrician to discuss why her energy levels and/or attention span are fluctuating regularly?

Have you talk to her about it or just assumed she is being lazy? Did u try helping her maintaib a schedule or qsk her what about this subject is so hard to her?\n\nThis is probably not the case, but I suffered a lot from hearing my parents call me lazy because I didnt study and got average grades. I ended up believing I was stupid for most of my teenage and youbg adult years, because I tried to study but ended up doing something else.\n\nTurns out I have ADHD, and was only diagnosed in college. The damage was done though, I had to work for years with therapy to regain my selfsteem. \n\nIdk your daughter, and im not saying she have ADHD, Im just saying that communicating with an open mind could help. Because if you ask her, why is she not doing what you asked, why is she not putting an effort, and her reply is \"I don't know\", then she might actually not know.\n\nIf it was agreed before that if she did not worked on her assingments she woukd bot be allowed to go to homecoming, and she didnt do that, ok I understand the punishment.", "Wow you calling it laziness just shows me that you have no clue. I struggled like that with Latin. I was able to pick up some slack but I just really disliked the subject. Was really glad I was able to drop it in 11th grade. \nIt might be that being already behind gives her anxiety in class and no motivation to catch up as she hates it. Best thing to do is to tell her to see it through as it is necessary to graduate but to not stress over her grade. Also ask why she hates it so much. It is like with every other relationship. Communication is key and threatening her with rehoming the cat and not letting her go to the dance will just make her hate you and definitely not wanting to pass this class.", ">she just refuses to relearn what she got lazy with.\n\nI find that highly unlikely.\n\nYTA.", "So it's a mandated class that she doesn't want to be in\n\nShocking she's not fully applying herself /s\n\nSounds like the school is at fault here regurgitating material she's already learned and is bored repeating", "I saw that, I\u2019m more wondering what she herself has done.

As someone with ADHD, having a tutor dont do much, apecially if they use the same learning techniques and not ones adapted for people with learning disabilities.\n\nWhat bothers me is how much OP keeps calling her daughter lazy. Because its what happened to me, everytime I tried to explain that I didnt know why I couldnt study, specially for subjects that I didnt like, everytime I forgot an assignment or a chore I was supposed to do, they would scream that I was just being lazy.\n\nAnd then I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was in college struggling with my grades and having panic attacks.
