He wanted me to put them together in the software for the printing company, like type the names in and format the cards it\u2019s not hard, and he gave me the handwritten list of names. While transcribing them in one by one I messed up on the new associate doctors spouses name, I guess I didn\u2019t register what the scribble of letters were before the name and I just put Mrs. instead.

Yesterday on Saturday when I came I had a sticky note from the owner doctor asking me to reprint the one card and to just change Mrs. to Mr. My coworker who had looked them over was upset at me for missing it and said I was supposed to put those letters because its a military rank and was mad at me for just assuming to put Mrs. instead. I tried to say I didn\u2019t know and she said next time I need to ask someone because it\u2019s very rude to make assumptions. I would have asked but I\u2019m a little intimidated by the new doctor. Also the name was Lindsay and I thought it was a woman\u2019s name thats why I put Mrs., not because the doctor is a man.\n\nI said I was sorry and would fix the card and she just shook her head at me and said I\u2019m apologizing to the wrong person.

I was given a handwritten list of names of staff and their SO's from the practice owner. We have a new doctor and his line looked like this:\n\n*Dr. John Doe and M(+ 2 letters I couldn't read) Lindsay Doe*\n\nI was confused because the letters didn't look like Mrs. but did start with M, and the doc who wrote the list has bad handwriting so I figured maybe it did say Mrs based on Lindsay being the name and typed that in for the invitation.

Might gently fix it if needed, but blowing up or sulk seems just blown out of proportion to me.", "NTA. It's a simple mistake and since you have time to reprint the card before sending it out there's really no foul here.\n\nThis is also a good lesson about not assuming something about someone based on their name alone.

I'm guessing the doctor opened it and saw it was addressed to \"Dr. and Mrs.\" so he must have mentioned something and so the owner doctor wrote me a note to have me reprint it as \"Dr. and Mr.\" I don't know how the doctor feels about it, like if maybe it wasn't a big deal to him but this is the kind of thing the owner cares a lot about so he had me reprint it... or maybe the doctor is really mad, or knew his SO would be mad if he saw it, I don't really know, but it was the owner doctor who originally wrote rank on the handwritten list and I'm not sure where he got that from."]}
