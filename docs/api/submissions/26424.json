My wife shut it down immediately, said absolutely not, and that if he wanted to go out he\u2019d have to wait a day one of us were off work.\n\nAfter Marcus left the room I spoke to my wife and told her maybe it wasn\u2019t such a bad idea him going since his friends dad would be there. She said no, he just couldn\u2019t and not to \u201cundermine\u201d her. I told her she needed to start letting Marcus have a life, and she needed to stop hovering over him just because she lost Sean. My wife completely blew up on me, crying, saying she could be as overprotective as she wanted, she was his mother, and I had no right to say that because I am as aware as her that the world is too dangerous.

He needs to be allowed to live his life. Marcus is grieving his brother too, and he doesn\u2019t need to have that compounded with the loss of the freedoms of his teenage experience. And of course you and your wife will always worry about him, but like you said, this was a supervised trip, he would have been safe. \n\nIt sounds like your wife would really benefit from therapy and/or some kind of grief support group. As you know, you\u2019re never the same after a loss like that, but life *can* get better.", "NTA.  If she doesn't let him live his life, she will end up losing both sons anyway as this one won't want to be around her as soon as he is an adult.  Has she spoken to anyone about her grief?  There are plenty of support groups that don't necessarily cost money - there are sadly a lot of people who have lost a child who share your experience.   \n\nMarcus has to have his life too - he should not be punished because his brother did a foolish thing and it cost him his life.  The world is dangerous - but its the only world we have, and he has to live in it.  Sheltering him now will only make it more dangerous for him later.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs help. Shes going to fuck your kid up if this isn't corrected. She might be his Mother but you are his Father. \n\nHonestly, I'd tell him he could go and not to worry about any consequences from his Mother. I'd be putting my foot down on this nonsense.", "Marcus is going to end up hating and resenting you both. He'll turn 18 and never look back. Get her help.", ">My wife completely blew up on me, crying, saying she could be as overprotective as she wanted, she was his mother, and I had no right to say that because I am as aware as her that the world is too dangerous. She then told me not even to mention this idea to marcum bc it was a big solid no.\n\nMy dude, you're very nearly one of the assholes here, but not for the reason you think you are.\n\nThis is a scenario that is not between two people, but three. your son Marcus is a person, not a thing, not a doll, not an object. He's a person with wants and wishes, and if your wife refuses to let him be out of reach of her he is going to run, and run fast the moment she has no authority over him. I can easily see your wife playing the wounded party in this event, acting like a victim and declaring, \"I just wanted you safe\" and manipulating him, but what she wants is to avoid experiencing the pain of loss again. She's less concerned with Marcus than she is with her own worries, and that's a major problem.\n\nIf you allow your wife to have her way, if you allow her to set the terms of things going forward you will not only be an asshole, but you will lose your son too.\n\nIt's time to step up and put your foot down hard. Your wife needs to be told that your son has **two** parents, both with equal authority and rights, and she is in fact the one who has **no right** to determine how things will go, that her \"hard no\" is as weak as a wet sponge in the grand scheme. Your wife needs therapy, not indulgence, and your son needs a hint of freedom.\n\nNTA unless you fail to act.", "NTA \n\nFirst and foremost, my condolences on your loss. \n\nLosing a son is life changing and I can\u2019t imagine how hard it has been for you all. But OP, this is outside of our scope. You all need professional guidance for this especially your wife. \n\nYour wife confining in fear will create more stress and resentment with your other son. He too is inherently deserving to live his life.", "NTA\n\nShe will most likely end up pushing him away or into more risky behaviors trying to get away from her", "NTA - I feel like if possible, you offering to go on the trip as well would put her mind at ease, but what you said was for your son. You were just simply advocating for him to have a normal life.", "NTA. Your wife needs help. Marcus is a teenage boy & while it\u2019s understandable that she fears what *could* happen, she can\u2019t keep him in the house with no friends. He needs them if he is to be a well adjusted adult. It\u2019s understandable that you wouldn\u2019t let him go swim with sharks or something like that, but he does need to be able to live his life. This is an age where he should be gaining independence.", "First off, I'm so sorry for the loss of your eldest. Whilst 3 years seems like a long time on paper, that still has to feel like yesterday for you and your family.\n\nYou're absolutely NTA - you're a great Dad for picking up on it and advocating for Marcus.\n\nChildren need to be introduced to independence gradually with a number of 'test flights' to build their confidence and your trust in their developing decision making and risk assessment skills. A good analogy is baby birds learning to fly, there's countless short test flights, some substantial scares and some horribly sad, rare, tragedies. Marcus at 14 should be well into his 'test flights', based on what you've written he's not even started.\n\nWhilst your wife's grief (yours too) should not be swept under the rug or diminished in any way - shielding Marcus from chances to build decision making and risk assessment skills is not healthy for anyone involved. At best, Marcus will miss out on many of the fun events that kids should have in their memory banks (like this very reasonable-sounding fishing trip) and probably become resentful about it. At worst, Marcus will be thrust suddenly into adulthood at 20ish armed with no skills to effectively assess personal risk vs reward decisions - this isn't just unfair to Marcus, its dangerous.\n\nA therapist who specialises in grief counseling may be helpful to assist your wife with strategies to manage her very understandable anxiety.", "NTA but I do think you could've handled this a bit more gently. Your wife is suffering due to the extremely traumatic loss of her child. I don't think telling her to \"stop hovering just because she lost Sean\" was a productive or gentle way to go about this. But yes, your wife does need some serious help to cope with and move on from your devastating loss. Her behavior isn't healthy and is harming your other child.", "NTA. I am sorry for your loss. Your wife should work on herself, maybe with a therapist, to grieve without taking away opportunities from Marcus. He should be able to live his life and do fun activities, he could end up resenting his mom and feeling bad for something he has no control over.", "NTA, you're 100% right. Your son should be able to have a life. All your wife is doing is causing your son Marcus to have resentment towards her and his brother who passed. I am so sorry for your loss, and I agree with everyone saying your wife needs therapy. I also think it would be good to have some family sessions, where Marcus would be able to share his feelings with a professional there to help mediate the conversation. I absolutely feel for your wife, I couldn't even imagine what the two of you have gone through. It wasn't either one of your faults, though, and if you truly feel that way, therapy could be helpful for you, too. I'd just hate to see this drive a wedge in your family, and this is an unbelievable grief you are all facing. So I really hope you all seek help, so you can all heal as a family and not divided. I wish you and your family so much luck.", "NTA. Your wife needs grief therapy. If she doesn't get help and stop with obsessing over your son, she is going to cause major damage.", "NTA. Her behavior is understandable, but it needs to stop.", "NTA. Your wife is grieving and is traumatized still. She needs to understand that pressuring your other son may even have worse outcomes, but I can see why she has trouble being rational and letting go. She needs therapy, lots of it. And you my friend have the impossible task of supporting both your son while helping your wife heal. Good luck.", "I'm surprised he hasn't fought back already or been sneaking out. he will so you have to keep a good relationship with him so he tells you where he is going or it will be dangerous", "NTA.  Your wife\u2019s grief has taken over her life, don\u2019t let it take over Marcus\u2019s as well. She needs grief counseling.", "NTA\n\nYou are an equal parent and deserve just as much of a say. Your wife was totally wrong to say that to you.\n\nLetting him go fishing friends parents present seems like exactly the kind of safe, supervised actively everyone should be able to agree on. And your wife absolutely needs to loosen up so he can start learning how to be a responsible adult. If he\u2019s overly sheltered now he\u2019ll likely be totally out of control in college. He just needs to learn life skills at this point.\n\nThis whole situation is really sad, and I don\u2019t think either of you should be blaming yourself for what happened to Sean.", "Nta, but pleae have the entire family in therapy. Your wife has valid trauma and needs support. You have as well. So has your son.\n\nI wish you healing.", "She's going to push the only child she has left away when that kid turns 18 and he is not gonna look back. He's going to resent her and he's gonna possibly go no contact with you because he is going to feel like nobody had his back so I would put my foot down for her to get some help and if she refuses, I would take that kid and get the hell out of there please she's not in a healthy place", "NTA. This is unhealthy behavior and she needs some serious help.\n\nIf you want my advice, you should look into separation until she gets her shit together. This is only doing far more harm than good. Keep us updated?", "NAH here. Sounds like your wife could benefit from therapy, she's clearly traumatized by the death of your eldest son.", "NTA\n\nThe loss of a child is traumatic, and I think everyone on this thread has seen more than a few threads where the parent becomes a helicopter parent like your wife. Therapy is the best option here. Otherwise, she may drive your family part completely, or make your son hate both of you because he views you as complicit in his suffering.", "NTA. \n\nIt is very possible if this goes unchecked she will lose Marcus anyway. Not because of an accident but because he will move out ASAP and cut contact with her. She needs help. Her grief and trauma are manifesting as extreme overprotection. This isn't healthy. For anyone.", "She needs help and your son needs a life. Make it so.  NTA.", "NAH- I totally understand how your wife feels, but all she will end up doing is pushing Marcus away so that once he becomes an adult he will either not have the right level of social skills and safety skills or he will just up and leave.", "NTA\n\nShe's going to \"overprotect\" him right into either risky behavior and going No Contact once grown or into making him an emotional cripple who lives as a recluse and can't do for himself.\n\nNeither outcome is good. Stand your ground, dad.", "NAH. You are right about your son, but your wife is not an \"asshole.\" She is traumatized by grief and desperately needs therapy. Please seek some sort of counseling for your family, I'm sure all three of you would benefit.\n\nI hope you all begin to heal and I'm sorry for your loss.", "i dont think she is an AH for that behaviour, that is what that kind of unhealthy guilt makes you do. this is not a matter of assholery or non assholery, this is a matter of therapy to accept the past. NAH", "NTA. \n\nHer behaviour is unreasonable and she needs to get into therapy asap or the minute your living child turns 18 he's going to be gone and not come back. \n\nIn holding him too tightly she's going to lose him.", "If your wife continues with this behavior you Will almost never see your child after he leaves for college. That child will bolt and try everything risky  behavior available and never look back.  If he doesn\u2019t start to rebel before 18. Your wife needs help processing her trauma and your son needs a life of his own.  If your wife can let go a little your child may Continue to include you both in the boys life. Do not allow him to mature and you\u2019ll seldom see your child. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA to you & wife.  I am so so sorry for the loss of your precious son.  Grief is so difficult to deal with & I can't even wrap my head around losing a child so suddenly.  Your wife desperately needs help & all this is WAY above any posters' ability here.

Your family will be in my prayers.", "NTA. That's just abuse. Your wife is insane and needs meds.", "NAH. What a terrible situation for you all. I\u2019m so sorry.

You\u2019re the parent too.", "What happens when your son wants to date? Get a job? Go to college? Will your wife insist on coming along every time or not let him leave her at all? She is literally imprisoning your son because she's refusing to let him have any freedom. At this rate, she WILL lose him because as soon as he's old enough he'll leave and cut contact.

She needs to understand that if she doesn't ease up her grip she's going to end up with a maladjusted young adult or losing both kids.\n\nPersonally, I'd say to your son that he can go and then have some serious with a family councilor ASAP.", "Tbh, she could be afraid of the fact that he will be around water.  Maybe come up with an alternative for him to do with his friend ? Or maybe set boundaries with your son and your wife.  Like let him go but tell him no swimming , must wear a life jacket , etc . Maybe it'll ease her mind.  To me, as a mother , I sense the hard no was because it's around water , and the fact she's already lost a child due to a water accident.she could have ptsd stemming around water.

Marcus absolutely deserves to have a life and go out with his friends. However, this may not be the trip to start with. I'm sure Marcus would be absolutely fine on the trip, but for your wife, who is obviously very paranoid, there might be a bit too much similarity to the trip your older son passed on. I wouldn't have been surprised if your wife had not been super overprotective but still not allowed the trip. It sounds like you are in a very difficult situation, but this can be a good opportunity to start real discussions and therapy.", "Wow I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I know the first thing people on Reddit say is you/your wife need therapy but seriously your wife needs therapy. She needs to grieve your older son appropriately and not smother your living child. Now is the time for Marcus to learn how to be responsible and make mistakes because he is still living with his parents and has your support and guidance. She\u2019s stunting his growth, figuratively speaking. \n\nWhen he does come of age legally, he will be ill prepared and he will pay for it greatly. He will likely leave as soon as he\u2019s of legal age without a plan or even money because he simply won\u2019t care. He\u2019ll also likely cut both of you out of his life for fear of interference. Moreover he will not seek out help from either of you if he needs it because he won\u2019t want to give up his freedom. Jeopardizing himself and his future further. \n\nIn all seriousness, what exactly does your wife plan to do when your son turns 18? She can\u2019t keep him prisoner \u201cto protect him.\u201d She need to realize she\u2019s punishing him for something that was a tragic accident. This is simply unfair to Marcus but it\u2019s also abusive. Not only now but the long term effects are as well. Your son needs to learn how to adult. That is your and your wife\u2019s responsibility. Not to imprison him in a falsely gilded cage.\n\nPlease get your wife some help or all of you will continue to pay for this behavior. Marcus is not going to remain a child.

Not too mention that a lot of kids who are overly restricted by parents crash and burn hard when they finally escape the leash because they've never properly learned to regulate themselves. \n\nShe isn't doing this out of malice, but if she can't learn to let go or get the help she needs...

Op understands this was a tragic accident that with proper understanding of the place and situation would have saved son's life. Wife however is not understanding this and needs therapy to help her move forward in life. And so you all know I had a heart attack at a young age due to stress and anxiety coupled with postpartum. I have been to the hospital so so so many times thinking I'm having another only to have to acknowledge that it is just a panic attack. Which by the way can give the exact same symptoms as a heart attack. I have had to learn and grow. The living son does not deserve to be deprived of life. Oh and by the way he is likely to be way more cautious because of the tragedy that affected hom in a significant way as well.
