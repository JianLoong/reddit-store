My wife shut it down immediately, said absolutely not, and that if he wanted to go out he\u2019d have to wait a day one of us were off work.\n\nAfter Marcus left the room I spoke to my wife and told her maybe it wasn\u2019t such a bad idea him going since his friends dad would be there. She said no, he just couldn\u2019t and not to \u201cundermine\u201d her. I told her she needed to start letting Marcus have a life, and she needed to stop hovering over him just because she lost Sean.

He needs to be allowed to live his life. Marcus is grieving his brother too, and he doesn\u2019t need to have that compounded with the loss of the freedoms of his teenage experience. And of course you and your wife will always worry about him, but like you said, this was a supervised trip, he would have been safe. \n\nIt sounds like your wife would really benefit from therapy and/or some kind of grief support group. As you know, you\u2019re never the same after a loss like that, but life *can* get better.", "NTA.  If she doesn't let him live his life, she will end up losing both sons anyway as this one won't want to be around her as soon as he is an adult.  Has she spoken to anyone about her grief?  There are plenty of support groups that don't necessarily cost money - there are sadly a lot of people who have lost a child who share your experience.   \n\nMarcus has to have his life too - he should not be punished because his brother did a foolish thing and it cost him his life.  The world is dangerous - but its the only world we have, and he has to live in it.  Sheltering him now will only make it more dangerous for him later.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs help. Shes going to fuck your kid up if this isn't corrected. She might be his Mother but you are his Father. \n\nHonestly, I'd tell him he could go and not to worry about any consequences from his Mother. I'd be putting my foot down on this nonsense.", "Marcus is going to end up hating and resenting you both. He'll turn 18 and never look back. Get her help.", ">My wife completely blew up on me, crying, saying she could be as overprotective as she wanted, she was his mother, and I had no right to say that because I am as aware as her that the world is too dangerous. She then told me not even to mention this idea to marcum bc it was a big solid no.\n\nMy dude, you're very nearly one of the assholes here, but not for the reason you think you are.\n\nThis is a scenario that is not between two people, but three. your son Marcus is a person, not a thing, not a doll, not an object. He's a person with wants and wishes, and if your wife refuses to let him be out of reach of her he is going to run, and run fast the moment she has no authority over him. I can easily see your wife playing the wounded party in this event, acting like a victim and declaring, \"I just wanted you safe\" and manipulating him, but what she wants is to avoid experiencing the pain of loss again. She's less concerned with Marcus than she is with her own worries, and that's a major problem.\n\nIf you allow your wife to have her way, if you allow her to set the terms of things going forward you will not only be an asshole, but you will lose your son too.\n\nIt's time to step up and put your foot down hard. Your wife needs to be told that your son has **two** parents, both with equal authority and rights, and she is in fact the one who has **no right** to determine how things will go, that her \"hard no\" is as weak as a wet sponge in the grand scheme. Your wife needs therapy, not indulgence, and your son needs a hint of freedom.\n\nNTA unless you fail to act.", "NTA \n\nFirst and foremost, my condolences on your loss. \n\nLosing a son is life changing and I can\u2019t imagine how hard it has been for you all. But OP, this is outside of our scope. You all need professional guidance for this especially your wife. \n\nYour wife confining in fear will create more stress and resentment with your other son. He too is inherently deserving to live his life.", "NTA\n\nShe will most likely end up pushing him away or into more risky behaviors trying to get away from her", "NTA - I feel like if possible, you offering to go on the trip as well would put her mind at ease, but what you said was for your son. You were just simply advocating for him to have a normal life.", "NTA. Your wife needs help. Marcus is a teenage boy & while it\u2019s understandable that she fears what *could* happen, she can\u2019t keep him in the house with no friends. He needs them if he is to be a well adjusted adult. It\u2019s understandable that you wouldn\u2019t let him go swim with sharks or something like that, but he does need to be able to live his life. This is an age where he should be gaining independence.", "First off, I'm so sorry for the loss of your eldest. Whilst 3 years seems like a long time on paper, that still has to feel like yesterday for you and your family.\n\nYou're absolutely NTA - you're a great Dad for picking up on it and advocating for Marcus.\n\nChildren need to be introduced to independence gradually with a number of 'test flights' to build their confidence and your trust in their developing decision making and risk assessment skills. A good analogy is baby birds learning to fly, there's countless short test flights, some substantial scares and some horribly sad, rare, tragedies. Marcus at 14 should be well into his 'test flights', based on what you've written he's not even started.\n\nWhilst your wife's grief (yours too) should not be swept under the rug or diminished in any way - shielding Marcus from chances to build decision making and risk assessment skills is not healthy for anyone involved. At best, Marcus will miss out on many of the fun events that kids should have in their memory banks (like this very reasonable-sounding fishing trip) and probably become resentful about it. At worst, Marcus will be thrust suddenly into adulthood at 20ish armed with no skills to effectively assess personal risk vs reward decisions - this isn't just unfair to Marcus, its dangerous.\n\nA therapist who specialises in grief counseling may be helpful to assist your wife with strategies to manage her very understandable anxiety.", "NTA but I do think you could've handled this a bit more gently. Your wife is suffering due to the extremely traumatic loss of her child. I don't think telling her to \"stop hovering just because she lost Sean\" was a productive or gentle way to go about this. But yes, your wife does need some serious help to cope with and move on from your devastating loss. Her behavior isn't healthy and is harming your other child.", "NTA. I am sorry for your loss. Your wife should work on herself, maybe with a therapist, to grieve without taking away opportunities from Marcus. He should be able to live his life and do fun activities, he could end up resenting his mom and feeling bad for something he has no control over.", "NTA, you're 100% right. Your son should be able to have a life. All your wife is doing is causing your son Marcus to have resentment towards her and his brother who passed. I am so sorry for your loss, and I agree with everyone saying your wife needs therapy. I also think it would be good to have some family sessions, where Marcus would be able to share his feelings with a professional there to help mediate the conversation. I absolutely feel for your wife, I couldn't even imagine what the two of you have gone through. It wasn't either one of your faults, though, and if you truly feel that way, therapy could be helpful for you, too. I'd just hate to see this drive a wedge in your family, and this is an unbelievable grief you are all facing. So I really hope you all seek help, so you can all heal as a family and not divided. I wish you and your family so much luck.", "NTA. Your wife needs grief therapy. If she doesn't get help and stop with obsessing over your son, she is going to cause major damage.", "NTA. Her behavior is understandable, but it needs to stop.", "NTA. Your wife is grieving and is traumatized still. She needs to understand that pressuring your other son may even have worse outcomes, but I can see why she has trouble being rational and letting go. She needs therapy, lots of it. And you my friend have the impossible task of supporting both your son while helping your wife heal. Good luck.", "I'm surprised he hasn't fought back already or been sneaking out. he will so you have to keep a good relationship with him so he tells you where he is going or it will be dangerous", "NTA.  Your wife\u2019s grief has taken over her life, don\u2019t let it take over Marcus\u2019s as well. She needs grief counseling.", "NTA\n\nYou are an equal parent and deserve just as much of a say. Your wife was totally wrong to say that to you.\n\nLetting him go fishing friends parents present seems like exactly the kind of safe, supervised actively everyone should be able to agree on. And your wife absolutely needs to loosen up so he can start learning how to be a responsible adult. If he\u2019s overly sheltered now he\u2019ll likely be totally out of control in college. He just needs to learn life skills at this point.\n\nThis whole situation is really sad, and I don\u2019t think either of you should be blaming yourself for what happened to Sean.", "Nta, but pleae have the entire family in therapy. Your wife has valid trauma and needs support. You have as well. So has your son.\n\nI wish you healing.", "She's going to push the only child she has left away when that kid turns 18 and he is not gonna look back. He's going to resent her and he's gonna possibly go no contact with you because he is going to feel like nobody had his back so I would put my foot down for her to get some help and if she refuses, I would take that kid and get the hell out of there please she's not in a healthy place", "NTA. This is unhealthy behavior and she needs some serious help.\n\nIf you want my advice, you should look into separation until she gets her shit together. This is only doing far more harm than good. Keep us updated?", "NAH here. Sounds like your wife could benefit from therapy, she's clearly traumatized by the death of your eldest son.", "NTA\n\nThe loss of a child is traumatic, and I think everyone on this thread has seen more than a few threads where the parent becomes a helicopter parent like your wife. Therapy is the best option here. Otherwise, she may drive your family part completely, or make your son hate both of you because he views you as complicit in his suffering.", "NTA. \n\nIt is very possible if this goes unchecked she will lose Marcus anyway. Not because of an accident but because he will move out ASAP and cut contact with her. She needs help. Her grief and trauma are manifesting as extreme overprotection. This isn't healthy. For anyone.", "She needs help and your son needs a life. Make it so.  NTA.", "NAH- I totally understand how your wife feels, but all she will end up doing is pushing Marcus away so that once he becomes an adult he will either not have the right level of social skills and safety skills or he will just up and leave.", "NTA\n\nShe's going to \"overprotect\" him right into either risky behavior and going No Contact once grown or into making him an emotional cripple who lives as a recluse and can't do for himself.\n\nNeither outcome is good. Stand your ground, dad.", "NAH. You are right about your son, but your wife is not an \"asshole.\" She is traumatized by grief and desperately needs therapy. Please seek some sort of counseling for your family, I'm sure all three of you would benefit.\n\nI hope you all begin to heal and I'm sorry for your loss.", "i dont think she is an AH for that behaviour, that is what that kind of unhealthy guilt makes you do. this is not a matter of assholery or non assholery, this is a matter of therapy to accept the past. NAH", "NTA. \n\nHer behaviour is unreasonable and she needs to get into therapy asap or the minute your living child turns 18 he's going to be gone and not come back. \n\nIn holding him too tightly she's going to lose him.", "If your wife continues with this behavior you Will almost never see your child after he leaves for college. That child will bolt and try everything risky  behavior available and never look back.  If he doesn\u2019t start to rebel before 18. Your wife needs help processing her trauma and your son needs a life of his own.  If your wife can let go a little your child may Continue to include you both in the boys life. Do not allow him to mature and you\u2019ll seldom see your child. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA to you & wife.  I am so so sorry for the loss of your precious son.  Grief is so difficult to deal with & I can't even wrap my head around losing a child so suddenly.  Your wife desperately needs help & all this is WAY above any posters' ability here.

Your family will be in my prayers.", "NTA. That's just abuse. Your wife is insane and needs meds.", "NAH. What a terrible situation for you all. I\u2019m so sorry.

You\u2019re the parent too.", "What happens when your son wants to date? Get a job? Go to college? Will your wife insist on coming along every time or not let him leave her at all? She is literally imprisoning your son because she's refusing to let him have any freedom. At this rate, she WILL lose him because as soon as he's old enough he'll leave and cut contact.

She needs to understand that if she doesn't ease up her grip she's going to end up with a maladjusted young adult or losing both kids.\n\nPersonally, I'd say to your son that he can go and then have some serious with a family councilor ASAP.", "Tbh, she could be afraid of the fact that he will be around water.  Maybe come up with an alternative for him to do with his friend ? Or maybe set boundaries with your son and your wife.  Like let him go but tell him no swimming , must wear a life jacket , etc . Maybe it'll ease her mind.  To me, as a mother , I sense the hard no was because it's around water , and the fact she's already lost a child due to a water accident.she could have ptsd stemming around water.

Marcus absolutely deserves to have a life and go out with his friends. However, this may not be the trip to start with. I'm sure Marcus would be absolutely fine on the trip, but for your wife, who is obviously very paranoid, there might be a bit too much similarity to the trip your older son passed on. I wouldn't have been surprised if your wife had not been super overprotective but still not allowed the trip. It sounds like you are in a very difficult situation, but this can be a good opportunity to start real discussions and therapy.", "Wow I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I know the first thing people on Reddit say is you/your wife need therapy but seriously your wife needs therapy. She needs to grieve your older son appropriately and not smother your living child. Now is the time for Marcus to learn how to be responsible and make mistakes because he is still living with his parents and has your support and guidance. She\u2019s stunting his growth, figuratively speaking. \n\nWhen he does come of age legally, he will be ill prepared and he will pay for it greatly. He will likely leave as soon as he\u2019s of legal age without a plan or even money because he simply won\u2019t care. He\u2019ll also likely cut both of you out of his life for fear of interference. Moreover he will not seek out help from either of you if he needs it because he won\u2019t want to give up his freedom. Jeopardizing himself and his future further. \n\nIn all seriousness, what exactly does your wife plan to do when your son turns 18? She can\u2019t keep him prisoner \u201cto protect him.\u201d She need to realize she\u2019s punishing him for something that was a tragic accident. This is simply unfair to Marcus but it\u2019s also abusive. Not only now but the long term effects are as well. Your son needs to learn how to adult. That is your and your wife\u2019s responsibility. Not to imprison him in a falsely gilded cage.\n\nPlease get your wife some help or all of you will continue to pay for this behavior. Marcus is not going to remain a child.

Not too mention that a lot of kids who are overly restricted by parents crash and burn hard when they finally escape the leash because they've never properly learned to regulate themselves. \n\nShe isn't doing this out of malice, but if she can't learn to let go or get the help she needs...

Our daughter still lives with us with her daughter, our oldest son lives about 90 minutes away. \n\nThe worry over loosing another child is a fear that never ends. I\u2019ve lived in a constant state of fear ever since our youngest died. And yes, I\u2019ve been to therapy and I\u2019ve been in several support groups for grieving parents. From therapy I\u2019ve learned that loosing a child can cause a type of PTSD, and from the support groups I learned how to carry the grief and the fear. I also learned that mothers and fathers grieve differently, but both grieve as deeply. \n\nIt\u2019s common for one or the other parent, sometimes both, to become over protective of the living child. Even though I lost mine while all 3 were adults, I hovered over the other two for quite a while. I still do, to be honest, I just keep it as quietly to myself as I can as they go about their lives. They are both aware though and when they see the worry in my face they will reassure me. \n\nAt 14 your son is too young to be expected to understand his mother\u2019s fear and yes, he\u2019s in danger of being smothered.\n\nYour wife needs therapy if she hasn\u2019t gone already, specifically therapy with someone who deals with grief and the kind of guilt your wife is dealing with. You might also look for a support group specifically for grieving parents. Even if she won\u2019t join, it would benefit you, because parents there can help you lead her into healing. Better to talk about this with people who have actually lost a child and know how to navigate this new normal, than a bunch of Reddit strangers who have never lost a child and have no idea of what the reality is like. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry about your son and I\u2019m sorry your living son has to deal with this.", "YTA for disagreeing with a woman", "INFO: Why are you here asking Reddit strangers about this instead of going to family and individual therapy to deal with the loss of your son?", "NAH.

You need to understand that it appears that your wife is in fight or flight mode for the life of your living child. This hypervigilant mode is a response to the loss. this hypervigilant mode is not going to go away with words from you. Hypervigilance is a natural part of PTSD. Whether she is awake or asleep your wife is thinking about what can hurt her child and how can she prevent it. Can you imagine existing like that for years. If you can you can start to see her basis of hypervigilance. What I would recommend is that you get some counseling then after you've gotten some good tools on your tool belt to approach your wife then I would approach her. The reason that I would recommend you speaking with someone first is because you are going to learn the best approaches from a trained person. When you're dealing with a grieving mother and hypervigilance professional with knowledge of how to handle this is going to be your best key to helping unlock this for your family. I know it seems like I haven't mentioned your living child this is about his life I know. Logically as a father you would think talking with your wife and your son talking with your wife would be enough to persuade them. Under normal circumstances it would be. But we are dealing with someone who is themselves in a constant state of crisis. So we need somebody who knows how to deal with people in crisis. Not only will the therapist help you learn how to approach and talk to your wife about this it will also help you with your grieving process. Your son would probably love to be able to speak with someone to have a safe venting outlet where he can talk about his overprotective mom and his feelings about it. This would also give another adult being able to back up yours and your son's opinion when it comes to opening up his life more. I know this sounds frustratingly long but your wife has had this state of hypervigilance for a long time so it's going to take a little bit of time to help unwind it.", "Yta I'm sorry about your older son but he died in a water based way while away from both of you and youre picking another water based activity to be Marcus's first venture away from his still obviously grieving mother?

You both deserve grace and the knowledge that it wasn\u2019t your faults and that your other son does in fact need to live his life and the best thing you can do is teach him to be safe but ultimately let him go out and live it himself.

However, this infection got in her bloodstream and attacked her organs.  \nThursday: \"I think I may be coming down with something.\"  \nFriday: \"Must be a cold.\" \nSaturday at 1pm she was gone.  \nAccording to nearly every doctor I speak with, this is a freak infection. There was nothing we could have done.  \n\nYet deep down there is a feeling that we should have known. We should have done something. All of this is ultimately our fault. Because, even if it isn't our fault, it should be. We failed her. \"What if...?\"\n\nYour wife may be suffering from the \"What-If\" monster.

I've identified many \"what if\" scenarios where things could have been better for them. I'll never speak them aloud because they are likely thinking it already. But knowing where their heads are at gives me the opportunity to be a supportive friend.\n\nThe trick is to think of the What-If monster as some small weak think mewling in the corner of your mind. Give it no attention. Do not listen to its whispers. In the final Harry Potter moving, the thing dying beneath the bench in the white train station looks just like my \"What-If\" monster. I'm trying to let it die.  I know it never will.\n\nWhat you must accept is the \"new normal\". You may have heard this. I hate it. The new normal sucks. But it's what we have.

This is the hand we were dealt.\n\n5 years later and my two remaining children are now young adults. They drive long distances alone at night. They go out to bars and concerts with their boyfriends and girlfriends. They have a life to lead and we have to let them go live it.\n\nYet being a little screwed up, my wife and I are certain that if they don't check in with us, it must mean they are gone forever. The phone rings and we fear the news we're going to hear. \n\nSo we ask our children to text us when they get where they're going. Or to text us when they leave. Or to text us every day that they are gone. We ask their boyfriends to remind our daughters to do this. We have the phone numbers of their friends. We know where they live.\n\nIt'll never be a stress-free life. We can do what we can to mitigate the pain. My wife and I remain committed to each other. We can talk about anything. We remind each other not to feed the What-If monster. Those are the rules.

Talk.\n\nYou and your family need to find a path from where you are now to a place where your son is allowed to go off on his own. \n\nSomething just popped into my head as I write this. If Marcus doesn't have a phone by now, get him one. Have him text his mother a few times a day to let her know he loves her, that he's okay, that he appreciates her. If he can move his relationship with his mom from constant contact to partially electronic, then she'll still be with him wherever he goes. Even if he's standing right next to her. Their time apart might be able to lengthen. I don't know. Worth a shot. \n\nMy love and prayers to you and your wife and your son. This weekend, at church, my wife is going to ask me why I'm giggling while I pray.

I, too, wanted to keep my son from danger.  When I finally got into therapy, I was diagnosed with PTSD.  She may have the same.

However, there are many parents who wouldn't send their 14 year old on a trip with a bunch of other kids, and only one adult (do you know the guy?) that I assume is trustworthy and capable of keeping them safe near a body of water, especially since teenage boys are known to be risk takers.

Her wild overreaction is a symptom triggered by a normal life event, and to continue shutting down any water activities three years after her other child's death is beyond a clutch response.

Especially not when that's your wife, the person you've built a family with and sworn to  be a team with.", "Unless there is a court order in place most (in most US States) either parent can exorcise custody at any time. \n\nIANAL so results may vary, but I've had to testify in a friends family court hearing.  He ended up withdrawing his request because with no order, he can just go get his kids at any point.", "Hovering over your child, not letting him see friends and do normal teen things and develop socially is indeed child abuse. He is only going to resent them both for not letting him live his life. He is almost an adult and he has basically no say in any aspect of his life. The mom gives him zero freedom to explore and figure out who he is as a person. She needs help for the sake of the child they have left", "I think they're referring to the entire three years of his life being suffocated by his mothers \"protection\" as abuse.", "This is the world of reddit therapists lol. Any slight conflict is abuse and you should leave him/her/your family immediately, go no contact and burn your cellphone", "hovering over your kids until they goto college just ensures that they won\u2019t know how to party responsibly, stand up for themselves and fix their own problems. Also yikes on victim blaming your own sister for being a victim of SA.", "The husband and son should be involved in the counselling so that she realises how much she's ruining the relationship.\n\nBut aside from the whole everyone should always get therapy thing, there's no indication that the husband or son need *serious* therapy - emphasis on the serious - even if it's never a bad thing.", "This. \n\nI lost several loved ones, a couple in particularly horrific and shocking ways. My fear and anxiety over any relatives and friends going and doing similar activities was over the top, I would drink to cope so I didn\u2019t have panic attacks. But I couldn\u2019t sleep or eat, I was so distraught.\n\nI can empathize SO much with OP\u2019s wife that it doesn\u2019t feel okay to call her an AH. But she does desperately need grief counseling to help her come to terms with this and move forward. People can move forward, but it is brutally hard.", "She needs love and support, part of that is having people In her life that love her enough to stop her from damaging the relationship with her son.", "There isn't going to be a next fishing trip. There isn't going to be anything until the kid turns 18. So there's going to be a blow up at some point, why not now. What makes the next fishing trip the better time to blow it up?", "Im prolly gonna have to go NC soon too", "Man that's terrible,  I hope he's doing better these days.", "When you\u2019ve had a parent suffocate you while growing up, maybe you can check back after 3 years of trying to help her get better just to say wait some more.  He\u2019s 4 years from legally being able to cut contact now.  And he WILL as soon as he\u2019s able.  She\u2019s already probably set that child up for a life of anxiety - but go ahead & keep letting her smother her child because she\u2019s all that matters", "I agree that dad needs to go to bat for him, but right now, the kids is just disappointed, but not caught between his parents in an argument because they have discussed it outside of his presence.\n\nIt's completely different if one parent says yes, and the other says no to the kid, or in his presence.", "You and u/Foxlikebox are absolutely right in all your comments. I was stunned and saddened I had to scroll so far to find anyone willing to point this out. OP is NTA for looking out for Marcus. But the way he spoke to his wife was very hurtful, not constructive, and would only worsen the situation by adding pain, anger, and tension. (So much so that it makes him TA in that moment, imo.) \"Just because you lost your son\" -- jeeeesus. That phrase will shut down any meaningful conversation. That being said, moving through grief is painful and difficult for everyone involved. I understand OP is also struggling to navigate his own path, and he became frustrated.\n\nBut if OP leaves the conversation feeling he was right to speak to his wife that way, feeling so vindicated by his frustration on Marcus' behalf that he is not willing to admit his delivery was wrong and hurtful -- then that is a loss for this family.\n\nHis wife would benefit from therapy, and they would all benefit from family therapy together as well.", ">While it is also his loss, he's clearly recovered better than she has with this. Based on everything he wrote here, he doesn't need things like grief counseling.\n\nComplete supposition.  It could also be because his wife is a wreck he has no choice but to force himself to compartmentalise his emotions so that someone can actually be a voice of reason in the parenting duties.", "I see. You have a point. Maby he is frustrated, because his only child is being destroyed by his teamate.", "She cannot expect Marcus to wait for her to process her feelings and resolve irrational fear before he goes fishing with friends. He is 14 and life is happening pretty quickly for him. \n\nShe will feel better after he has gone out without her and come back home on time.", "Why does he have to get punished because he\u2019s brother happened to die? I really don\u2019t understand why poor kid has to miss out.", "A lot of people also minimize risk because they haven\u2019t had to deal with something going catastrophically wrong. For OPs wife, she\u2019s experienced that very real scenario. And society comes down so hard on moms when it comes to the safety of their kids, while dads get cookies for any \u201chelp\u201d they can muster.  It sounds like the mom has internalized that a great deal of that.", "> he should be gradually exploring being independent and working on making decisions about safety and so on by himself\n\nExactly. And I think what Mom is missing in her grief is that she wasn't the only person who lost someone. Yes, she lost her son, but her living son also lost his brother. And that is already naturally going to make him more cautious and risk-avoidant without her having to step in and make those decisions for him.", "Not being allowed to attend a specific activity is not harming anyone. This is a transition period into teen-hood. \n\nThey aren't \"out of time\", it's a process for everybody. \n\nPlenty of teens have been told they're not allowed to do things for far sillier reasons than \"I have lived experience that tells me that if I let my kids do potentially dangerous things without me, they could die.\"", "Oh it's 100% ongoing.  But we are wondering if this is also the first time OP has challenged his wife on these suffocating restrictions.  It's for that reason that several of us, including I think the person you responded to, don't think OP should leap straight to telling Marcus to go on this trip and let him \"handle\" mom.", "Yep, there's only so far you can go in trying to gently argue against an unyielding, unilateral \"no\". The biggest issue with this sub is that you're branded an asshole unless you tiptoe across issues like this when in reality tiptoeing doesn't work because the person simply ignores it.\n\nWhen it comes to this kind of thing people only ever respond to escalations that let them know exactly how close they are to fucking their kid or marriage up for good. Escalations that are significant enough to make them realise exactly how close to the edge of the cliff they are. It sucks but that's how people are, sometimes you simply need to throw some dynamite into the water.\n\nThis has been going on for **three years**, there is no way to avoid significantly escalating this if OP wants it addressed. OP needs to throw the dynamite in the water.", "Not speaking on this post alone, but do you know what else is damaging to kids? People staying married when they have no business putting their children through their crap anymore.", "He is, life seems to be treating him well.", "Yes, i grew up with suffocating parents, you have no idea. Im telling you that your suggestion for dad to hit her back with her own medicine is bad advice and doesnt do a damn thing to help the situation. It's just unnecessarily petty for petty's sake.", "Wrong", "Frustration is understandable, but it's also not going to help the situation. The entire family needs therapy and she needs specialized therapy.", "He has 4 years. During those 4 years he *should* be gradually expanding his independence and practicing decision making skills in safe situations. Not allowing that natural development to happen is abusive.", "No.", "Trauma and grief aren\u2019t linear.  As the second child grows older and reminds his parents of their first, it makes sense that trauma would resurface.\n\nMom\u2019s wrong, but she deserves compassion and likely can\u2019t see past her fear.  When we are sick, scared and hurt, we\u2019re often the least likely to reach out for help. OP should talk through that with his wife and help her reach back out for help.  Yes she\u2019s a mom, but she is a person for crying out loud.  And when the people you live are hurt you should help them.  It\u2019s not either or with mom and son.  The best way is everyone moving forward together.  \n\nThe son is also old enough now that they should probably have a conversation about how they feel, and their fears for him.  And while that doesn\u2019t mean he should be held on a tight leash, it might help him understand that his parents are just trying to love him and keep him safe.\n\nJumping to meanness and ultimatums will just make her feel more justified and worsen her fear.", "This is not just about one activity.", "I'm going to guess it's not the first time OP has tried to say something. And no matter when OP addresses this specific incident, it's going to be a moment.  Marcus might not have the opportunity to go on a trip like this again - people stop inviting when the answer is always \"no.\" And I'm sure people are aware of why the answer is \"no.\" So, this is the perfect time for OP to override his wife and plan to have a therapist ready. The trip is that big of a deal - to Marcus. And the marriage is already in trouble.", "Bingo!!!!", "If divorce happens it is because of everyone involved . Period. That is how divorce works", "That's helpful \ud83d\ude44", "Yes, absolutely this. He will find ways to do things and some of them might be unsafe.", "That's what I was thinking. And the harder she grips, the faster he's going to slip through her fingers. Four years from now, he'll be 18 and will either go halfway across the country to go to college or move out in the middle of the night and possibly even live in poverty to avoid being suffocated. Her grief is legitimate, but she's refusing to get help and will have to accept the consequences that will surely come later.", "This is a great point I would share with her. \"He is going to end up lying to us and sneaking out. Which is unsafe. Wouldn't we rather know who he is with and where rather than force him into a situation where he rebels and engages in risky behaviour\"", "Yup. Apparently his wife never saw Footloose.", "No - Are you saying if an abused divorces from an abuser, the victim was responsible for divorce too.", "So if someone gets divorced because their spouse cheated, they're somehow at fault themselves as well?", "That's not how divorce works. Period. Just because you are involved in a divorce does not mean it is in any way because of you. Any other take is putting part of the blame for divorces on kids and that is just fucking delusional.", "Gotta love people  who block you so that they don\u2019t have to have a response to their comment \u2026.\n\n\n\nIf that person chose to divorce as a consequence of cheating, absolutely the marriage failed in part because of the choice that the person who was cheated on made.  It\u2019s not about \u201cfault \u201c it\u2019s about everyone in the marriage has and makes choices that either keep the marriage intact or end it.

This is clearly not some one off instance of him wanting to do something. He knows he is basically treated like an infant because his older brother died.  He right now thinks both of his parents don't want him to have a life. \n\nThe dad needs to go for bat for his son. Maybe not this trip he goes on, but he needs to see that his dad is working on it. \n\nThe mom needs therapy. The family doesn't need it. She needs it.", "And possibly limit contact when he's old enough. \n\nNTA. Opie, firstly, so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what you and your family have been through. However, I would tread carefully here. Some of these suggestions will blow your marriage out of the water. Read the responses and then think about what you want to happen. Therapy sounds like a great idea. There are also groups for parents who've lost their children, look into this. And probably ones for people who've lost siblings. \n\nWishing you and yours all the best!", "You are married to your kids ? Where is that exactly?", "I agree. I was only disagreeing about the way to handle it. Not what needed to be done."]}
