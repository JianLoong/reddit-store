We are over the moon and so looking forward to meeting our son! My husband owns and runs his own business, and so do I. We are both very happy with our jobs. \n\nRecently we started talking about schools, childcare and jobs etc. Now it\u2019s important to note that my husband and I are very safety oriented, and weary of people we don\u2019t know. I stated that I\u2019d like to go back to work pretty soon after the baby is born. I am looking forward to spending time with the baby, but I am in no way interested in staying home with him full time. I\u2019m imagining being back full time when he\u2019s around 8/10 months. \n\nMy husband was under the impression that I\u2019d be staying home with the baby until he goes to kindergarten (maybe even longer). I was a bit taken aback because I had no idea why he thought this. He stated he wasn\u2019t really comfortable with leaving our child with a sitter. (Note: Nannies are hard to come by where we live, and we both require some certain safety requirements for said nanny, which makes it hard to find someone suitable). I told him I wanted to start looking into nannies before the child was born, so that they could get to know the baby during my maternity leave. That way they would both be familiar with each other by the time I go back to work. \n\nHe started arguing a bit about what our expectations were. I understand not every mom would be comfortable with my choices, but I cannot handle being a SAHM. I know it would mentally tear me apart, and it has no appeal to me. We are both in control of our own work hours, so it\u2019s not like we won\u2019t spend any time with the child. We just both love our job, and also need time to be people and not just parents. \n\nHe said I was TA for not wanting to stay home until the baby starts school, and I said he was being a dick for expecting that of me. He is respecting my decision and he supports me, no matter what I decide. I recognize where he\u2019s coming from, but I just cannot for the life of me be a SAHM. But I guess I do feel a little bad, because I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m TA. \n\nInfo: His business requires a bit more of him, and requires him physically showing up for some parts of the job, which is why he cannot be the one to stay home. I have every means and access to stay home, I simply just do not want to. AITA for not staying home?\n\nEDIT: It is an accidental pregnancy due to failed birth control, but we are now very happy! We\u2019ve also talked about it in the past, where he didn\u2019t show any discomfort with childcare. Guess we\u2019re all a little more overprotective when it comes to our own kids.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm seeing a lot of comments stating why we haven\u2019t had this conversation before marriage, WE HAVE. My husband and I HAVE had this conversation, and we both decided we wanted to be child free. We talked about it before we got married, and have talked about it a lot since. We've even talked about accidental pregnancy, but never thought it would become real. This is a matter of failed birth control and we just found out I was pregnant in month four, so we weren't really left with many options. Furthermore my husband changed his mind about outside childcare once we were actually in the situation.

You have to still keep an eye on everyone involved in your child's upbringing. \n\nYour partner assuming you would shelve your business for 5 years is patriarchal and he needs to join the rest of us in the Year of Our Lord Two thousand and Twenty-two.", "NTA.

I suggest you look into structures daycares like Montessori style ones that offer professional services and standards. This allows you child to be safe and be out in the world where they are super stimulated and learn to live within society.\n\nIf you really can't deal with having the kid outside the home perhaps you could suggest that money and daddy split those first 5 years before kindergarten. He takes the first 2.5 years and you take the next or what ever. This way you both get to bond and learn to parent while knowing there is an end date to that commitment. I find having an end date really helps. And it doesn't capsize either of your careers.\n\nAlso this would allow you to consider eventually having more then one kid without indefinitely putting your career on the back burner or paying thousands of dollars a month in home child care.\n\nStaying at home also has a cost as your family income will drop by half while your expenses will go up.", "Obviously not an AH for wanting to have a career.

First of all, OP, this is the kind of conversation you should have before getting pregnant, But anyway, having a baby doesn't mean you have to leave your career aside. If your husband expects you to do it, maybe he should find a way to get some flexibility in his own job and cover some of the hours at home (I know you said he has to physically show up, but having a kid means you BOTH need to sacrifice, your life is going to change.

I prefer being a SAHM, but the economy says otherwise. I will say that jumping back into work so soon was great for me mentally because it maintained a social aspect that I didn't know I needed.

It would've been a hill for me to die on. \n\nWhile I don't exactly think your husband is an asshole, I think it's rude of him to presume something of you without discussion and then calling you TA.\n\nWould you be able to compromise by both working less hours so that one of you can be at home with the baby while both can still go to work?", "When I was studying literature I was gobsmacked to find that the nursery rhyme \"*Peter, Peter pumpkin eater had a wife and could not keep her,\"* was all about the jail imposed on women because conventional wisdom was that you could control a woman better after you got her pregnant. Its not even amusing funny that a 17th century construct can be applied to anyone today. Its just scary. I doubt OP's husband is doing a thesis on  historic oppression and disenfranchisement, but dang. Dude? C'mon?

The kids and I were involved in lots of groups and activities, and I met tons of people, and lots of new friends, while my husband kept the old ones, and actually went out less than we did. He and I went out regularly, as a friend sat for us.  I seldom went out *alone*, but, then neither did he, other than work. I was really jealous of his lunch breaks, though.  My kids all learned really young, that you don\u2019t interrupt mom\u2019s book at lunch, unless someone was bleeding!  \n\nI absolutely wanted to be a SAHM, and my husband agreed that I should be, so it was fine for us.

I was a SAHM with my 1st 3 kiddos; after a divorce, remarriage and 2 more kiddos I knew staying home wasn't for me. I love my job and mentally I need the stimulation and time away.

However, you both should have had this discussion BEFORE you became parents. No one can force you to stay at home! Find a good nanny who treats your child well and move on with life!

For example- find a nanny that can work for 4 hours in the morning, and leaves right before the baby goes down for a nap. So you work, come home, send the nanny off, put the baby down. Then you\u2019re able to get in another hour or two of work while the baby naps\u2026now you\u2019ve done a 5-6 hour work day.

I worked part time until my son was three years old then I went back to work full time. By that time we lived near my parents who picked by son up from preschool everyday after his nap ended around 1PM.   I could not be a full time SAHM.  i love my son and I loved to work.   It is up to everyone to decide for themselves how to raise their child.", "NTA and your husband absolutely is a dick for expecting that of you, guilt tripping you and calling you a bad mom WITHOUT offering to do the same. News flash to your husband - he is just as much a parent to this child as you are and he can stay at home with him just as well as he expects you to do it and throw your job away. It does not matter how much of his presence his job requires of him vs your job requires of you. The simple fact of the matter is that your husband is living in the 50s whereas it is 2022 and both parents can take parental leave. He just chooses to be a sexist jerk and expects you to put your life on hold. Nope, does not work that way anymore. Start looking for a nanny asap so you can introduce them to your family while you are still around and don't let your husband bully you to doing something that will make you miserable and could potentially destroy your relationship (though I must say if my man came to me with such an idea, I would be questioning my relationship already, but that is just me).", "But but but he LOVES his job! Why should he give up his job even though OP also loves her job? She's a woman! She's made for this sole purpose! She should be ecstatic to be a SAHM! She's just being selfish by not destroying her company and tanking her career! /s", "Right why can\u2019t he quit his career?", "SAHM to a 9 month old here. Your plan sounds pretty solid to me. 8-10 mouths is a significant amount of time to build a relationship with your little one. This is a great time to start them in a daycare and have them interact with other babies. Please do have a conversation about who stays home when the baby gets sick.", "If he\u2019s so wary of \u201cstrangers,\u201d he can put his money where his mouth is and stay home to take care of the baby for at least a couple of days a week. If it\u2019s that important to him as a parent, he will find a way as a business owner to make it work. It\u2019s convenient the way his wariness is soooo intense he expected you to ditch your business for five years, in direct contradiction of your pre-pregnancy discussions. Yet when you made it clear being a SAHM wasn\u2019t for you, that same wariness hasn\u2019t been enough to prompt him to step up to the SAHP plate to any degree; instead, he\u2019s just criticizing you.     \n\nThere are plenty of safety precautions you can take with selecting and employing a nanny. But in your shoes, I would be concerned about him nitpicking and even sabotaging working relationships with any nanny you select, to try to push you into staying home the way he wants.", "Never mind they usually carry the mental load for household tasks and chores.", "Exactly! Being a SAHM is not for everyone! It is a very serious decision!", "Lowkey? High Key!\n\nI love how he assumed she would just stay at home because she's the woman!", "Some of us have also been able to make it work.....I'm not saying it's easy, it's absolutely not, but it does depend on the job and the person and the baby.", "Yeah unless the kid is sick or childcare fell through TEMPORARILY. Brief exception for Covid.", "You can do that with daycares too. All of my friends with kids get semi-constant updates on their kids in daycare, including pictures.", "OP does say it was an accidental pregnancy. Sounds like it was not in the plans.", "500 per month is literally so worth it though.  The money you bring in working isn't just about the stage where the kids are in daycare. It's another rest of your career. It's about your social security payments. It's about the years you miss out on when you could be contributing to an IRA (because that $500 a month that you claim you don't need probably isn't going into a retirement accounts with just your name on it, despite the fact that you stay at home, is it?) Some couples really do continue putting money in the wife's IRA while she stays at home with the kids.\n\nThe fact that so many women end up in poverty in their old age is related to the fact that they choose to take time out of their careers, pay equal expenses with their husbands, and then live so much longer. \n\nWomen need to put on their financial lifejacket first.", "I have nothing but respect for those who are able to be SAHP. When my kids were small, going to work felt like a 'get out of jail free' card. It's not only about the boredom or the lack of adult interaction. For me, the biggest gift was just being able to be in control of my environment for a little while. No babies randomly starting to cry inconsolably, no matter what you try. No protracted power plays with toddlers obstinately refusing to follow the rules, no matter what you try. Just a bunch of people, each carrying out their pre-assigned roles and allowing you to do what you were planning to. Pure heaven!\n\nTo be fair, I had **very** flexible hours, so could more or less spend time with my children whenever I chose to. And finding good childcare is not half as expensive or hard here as it is in the USA. Also, I'm freely admit that I was never a perfect parent, especially at enforcing discipline. OTOH, my kids turned out great, and we unconditionally love each other, so ...\n\nEdit: Oh dear lord, left out the entire point of my post. OP, I never for one second felt guilty for working while my children were small. If I didn't have the opportunity to recharge at work, I would have been a far worse parent. Some can deal with being a SAHP, I can't. Kudos to you for realizing this early, OP, and for already thinking about how to deal with it. NTA, not even close.", "Arranged his career?  OP does say  that his job requires him to physically show up part of the time. She also says this was an accidental pregnancy, so it\u2019s not like there was any planning or expectations of a child being in the picture when they both chose their careers They either need to split the time or find that perfect nanny they were looking for.

I had hoped we would have another girl so that this wouldn\u2019t even be a question but it is what it is.", "Definitely. Even with his work requiring him to be on premise a bunch of times, if this wasn't coming from a place of misogyny, he would have discussed it with her and asked her whether she would be on board with being a SAHM instead of just expecting her to be on board.", "Yeah...I'm not comfortable with it either and I'm hoping my partner agrees even though he is circumcised.\nHappy cake day BTW!"]}
