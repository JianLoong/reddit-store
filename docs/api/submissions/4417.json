Quality day care is great, too. Nothing about having children is set it and forget it.  You have to still keep an eye on everyone involved in your child's upbringing. \n\nYour partner assuming you would shelve your business for 5 years is patriarchal and he needs to join the rest of us in the Year of Our Lord Two thousand and Twenty-two.", "NTA.

And being a SAHP is definitely not for everyone.\n\nAll parents go through the stress and worry of leaving their kids with a stranger. It's a challenge we all face. I suggest you look into structures daycares like Montessori style ones that offer professional services and standards. This allows you child to be safe and be out in the world where they are super stimulated and learn to live within society.\n\nIf you really can't deal with having the kid outside the home perhaps you could suggest that money and daddy split those first 5 years before kindergarten. He takes the first 2.5 years and you take the next or what ever. This way you both get to bond and learn to parent while knowing there is an end date to that commitment. I find having an end date really helps. And it doesn't capsize either of your careers.\n\nAlso this would allow you to consider eventually having more then one kid without indefinitely putting your career on the back burner or paying thousands of dollars a month in home child care.\n\nStaying at home also has a cost as your family income will drop by half while your expenses will go up.", "Obviously not an AH for wanting to have a career.

First of all, OP, this is the kind of conversation you should have before getting pregnant, But anyway, having a baby doesn't mean you have to leave your career aside. If your husband expects you to do it, maybe he should find a way to get some flexibility in his own job and cover some of the hours at home (I know you said he has to physically show up, but having a kid means you BOTH need to sacrifice, your life is going to change.

I prefer being a SAHM, but the economy says otherwise. I will say that jumping back into work so soon was great for me mentally because it maintained a social aspect that I didn't know I needed.

But we both recognize we\u2019ll be better, happier and more content parents if we have the opportunity to detach from parental responsibilities sometimes. \nPlus we need the money to live, just like everyone else:)", "I'm a sahm right now.  \n\nI'm sure it's great for some people but it sucks and I'm bored.\n\nOnly reason it's me is because their dad couldn't handle it and childcare for two tots is too expensive considering any job I'd get would only mean about 500 over costs of childcare a month. 500 that i don't need and that's with cheap questionable daycares that are at capacity anyway.", "AT LEAST the husband claims he'll support whatever her decision is, so it could have been worse.\n\nI think perhaps both parents hearts are in the right place, they're just overcoming some of the usual bumps and arguments that come with being a first time parent.\n\nIf/When the second kid comes, a lot of parents relax way too much. \"Eh he/she'll live, don't worry\"", "NTA. If at all possible I recommend both parents spending some time doing child care and working less than full time   Finding ideal child care is very difficult and requires back up plans at all times.", "If you choose a daycare, be prepared for your son to be sick about once a week until he builds up immunity to all the bugs out there, so you'll still need a back-up in house nanny.\n\nIf you hire a full-time nanny, be prepared for the disease onslaught to hit during kindergarten.  \n\nBTW, NTA - staying home w/ no adult contact is soul sucking.  Part time work is the best option, but, damn, it would be hard to find.", "Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece\r  \nJet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash\r  \nWe don't care", "> but we have great communication\n\nNTA because of course you won't be a bad mom or '\"endangering your baby with strangers\" by not being a SAHM but sorry no the communication is not great. You should start to talk about all the other stuff you need to agree on asap. Private or public school? Religious upbringing? Position on sexual education? Are you expected to be the one to leave work if the kid is sick in school and needs to be picked up? Problem if your kids is LBGTQ+ ? Gender roles are important or not? It sounds like your partner by ASSUMING you would give up your business is very into traditional gender role and has a patriarcal  view of the world, how do you want to teach that to your child? Many talks to have.", "Wary*\n\nWeary = tired", "Y'all are going to have to make a difficult peace with the fact that sometimes bad things happen. Sometimes strangers do them, sometimes people we trust do them, and sometimes random circumstance does them.\n\n That's not to say that reasonable caution isn't in order, but \"the only solution is that OP gives up her business and stays home for 5+ years because stranger danger\" is not a reasonable level of caution.\n\n I understand that being thrown headlong into being responsible for another human is terrifying, and my guess is your husband is trying to deal with the overall lack of control he has over the whole situation by being overprotective/controlling about this. But now is the time to do the work, maybe talk to a therapist, and get past that.", "it's ANOTHER birth control failure on Reddit. I hope all the birth control companies know their failure rate.", "Didn\u2019t mean to make it seem like I\u2019m trying to convince you. I just know my wife was the same way as you describe and when the kids came she never wanted to leave.

It's called unpaid work and it should be accounted for!", "I\u2019m on maternity leave and going back to work in a couple of months and honestly I don\u2019t really want to but I earn the most out of me and my partner so here I am. But when I was pregnant I always said I\u2019d never be the Sahm as I\u2019d be bored\u2026weird how things work out", "But it's also worth pointing out that a lot of women TRY being a SAHM and LOATHE IT.  Sorry but that's the truth.  Many women have a burning desire to return to work when they figure out how boring and relentless it is looking after a baby / small child. Thank God for childcare professionals is all I can say.", "I'm so tired of grown human women describing themselves as \"mamma bears\" and \"lionnesses\" omg. So creepy and tradwife\n\nEta - oh BTW, female lions kill male babies if they think they'll draw other males to the pack. But yea you're a lioness mama!!", "You had PostPartum Anxiety not lioness protectiveness. They are not the same.", "I had every intention of going back to work after I had my first child. When he was about three weeks old, my husband came home from church to find me bawling my eyes out because I had to go back to work in 6 to 7 weeks. We immediately started working on finances and figuring out how to get me to stay home. It took us a year, so I did have to go back to work at first, but then I became a stay at home mom.\n\nAll that to say\u2026 I totally agree with what you\u2019re saying.", "Surprisingly we\u2019ve already been around most of these topics with no issues! Guess we were planning a little too far ahead, but we\u2019ll definitely have to go over everything once more!", "I mean, that's a great argument as to why you shouldn't keep an accidental pregnancy if you've never discussed raising a child with the person you're having a kid with. They're the asshole for subjecting an innocent child to this.", "We are doing everything in our power to ensure our child is as happy, loved, safe and content as can be.

If you can live off your income, even if it is a drastic difference, he can give up his job.\n\nAt the end of the day, never make yourself financially dependent on a man who doesn\u2019t want to give you a choice.\n\nIt will eventually lead him to financially abuse you. You can already see him trying to make decisions for you without your consent. Be careful he doesn\u2019t try to sabotage your business.", "neither of you fancy caregiving as a full-time job. That's okay. Would you be okay with doing 2 days a week, and he does 2 days a week, and you use a childcare center/pay a friend for the remaining day?", "Or, he could set up an employer-subsidized childcare and include some of his other workers.  That would improve the quality and reduce the costs overall since it would be partly a business expense.\n\nBusinesses that have some sort of childcare benefit have less turnover and more committed employees.", "NOT what I'm trying to say at all.", "Well, it lasted 29 years whatever it is", "Not this tepid response when yall are having an actual child together... get on the same page fast or put this kid up for adoption", "Yeah, because no one has ever raised a surprise baby in a loving and healthy way.", "Let's all be honest here, neither of these parents wish to put the child first.\n\nHowever, no matter which way its dressed up, for the woman carrying this child to feel that way, shows an absolute lack of maternal instinct and feelings.\n\nMay not be popular to state this, but it's nevertheless true.", "That's what I was thinking as well. A couple days a week each working from home, and a nanny for some times, even days when they're at home if they want to feel more at ease when working, and more comfortable with the nanny. That sounds good to me. Tiring, but a good compromise to what they both want.", "Bingo", "all of this", "You said it much better than I did. Thank you.  It's so easy to be misunderstood on Reddit.  \n\nI was never and still am not one of those women who loves babies.  They're cute and all, but for like 10 minutes.

OP and partner are debating whether she be a SAHM, they hire a nanny, or split the duties. Your sage advice is if they can't figure out which person will sacrifice the most then put the kid up for adoption and let some random folks figure it out.  Hilarious!", "No. Ppd, ppa, and experience. OP can absolutely work. As her own boss, there are multiple ways she can work. As her spouse is also his own boss, the same goes for him. It doesn\u2019t need to be stay home OR work. And it doesn\u2019t have to be decided today. They have a lot of flexibility and options that most don\u2019t have, but they won\u2019t know which ones are best till after the kid is born for multiple reasons.", "Except she's saying she wants to work so just listen to her instead of acting like you know better.", "I never once said she shouldn\u2019t work.
