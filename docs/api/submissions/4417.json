Quality day care is great, too. Nothing about having children is set it and forget it.  You have to still keep an eye on everyone involved in your child's upbringing. \n\nYour partner assuming you would shelve your business for 5 years is patriarchal and he needs to join the rest of us in the Year of Our Lord Two thousand and Twenty-two.", "NTA.

And being a SAHP is definitely not for everyone.\n\nAll parents go through the stress and worry of leaving their kids with a stranger. It's a challenge we all face. I suggest you look into structures daycares like Montessori style ones that offer professional services and standards. This allows you child to be safe and be out in the world where they are super stimulated and learn to live within society.\n\nIf you really can't deal with having the kid outside the home perhaps you could suggest that money and daddy split those first 5 years before kindergarten. He takes the first 2.5 years and you take the next or what ever. This way you both get to bond and learn to parent while knowing there is an end date to that commitment. I find having an end date really helps. And it doesn't capsize either of your careers.\n\nAlso this would allow you to consider eventually having more then one kid without indefinitely putting your career on the back burner or paying thousands of dollars a month in home child care.\n\nStaying at home also has a cost as your family income will drop by half while your expenses will go up.", "Obviously not an AH for wanting to have a career.

First of all, OP, this is the kind of conversation you should have before getting pregnant, But anyway, having a baby doesn't mean you have to leave your career aside. If your husband expects you to do it, maybe he should find a way to get some flexibility in his own job and cover some of the hours at home (I know you said he has to physically show up, but having a kid means you BOTH need to sacrifice, your life is going to change.

I prefer being a SAHM, but the economy says otherwise. I will say that jumping back into work so soon was great for me mentally because it maintained a social aspect that I didn't know I needed.

My husband would never call me an asshole. You don\u2019t have great communication if he\u2019s calling you names", "I was lucky to have a friend who was an excellent caregiver. Hope you find someone you can trust.", "As OP says it was a surprise pregnancy. Since the conversation didn't happen assumptions cannot reasonably be made", "I would have said E S H until I saw this comment, because you absolutely should have talked about this before pregnancy. But if it was accidental, there probably wasn\u2019t time.\n\nNTA for not wanting to stay home. He could also stay home if he\u2019s that against leaving the kid with someone else.", "Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my kids, and I don't regret my choices. But man it would be nice for me to be able to get out maybe once a week by myself and have some alone time \ud83d\ude02 so no, you're not horrible for not wanting to be a SAHM lmao.\n\nMaybe show your husband my comments, because I don't think he realizes the toll it takes on our brains and personality. I have been working on getting less aggravated so easily because I've been so stretched thin. I like to think it's getting better, but it's still tough.", "Sticking to my answer, we all know accidents happen and you are keeping it. And in the 5 months you still didn't have a conversation. \n\nBoth you made a lot of assumptions leading you both to create this (easy to foresee) avoidable scenario.", "Well then, at some point you must have have a conversation about \u201cwe\u2019re pregnant, what now?\u201d  and deciding what happens after the baby is born should have been one of the top priorities.", "Thanks for replying. NTA, you do as you think is best for you and your family. He souldn't have pressured you. But you probably should have cleared this up before or right after getting pregnant", "I get it. Being a mother doesn\u2019t mean you cease to exist as your own human being.", "His business needs him, more than mine does me. Though I have told him if he refuses childcare, then he should feel free to stay home himself. Ironically he didn\u2019t want to, which he recognized was a dick move", "Don\u2019t give up or step back from something you love. Being a parent doesn\u2019t mean sacrifice your happiness. It will actually keep your more sane and capable as a parent by continuing to do what to you love on top of being a parent. Will you have to tweak things here and there? Yes but you CAN do both! NTA.", "Maybe so! At this moment I feel like it\u2019s absolutely not something I would want and therefore I want to prepare for going back to work. If I end up wanting to stay home that\u2019s no problem, I\u2019d just rather be over prepared than under.", "This is the same bullshit argument as \u201cYou don\u2019t _really_ mean you don\u2019t want kids, you\u2019ll definitely change your mind in the future\u201d", "Maybe, but some women just do want to progress their career whilst still loving their baby. A junior doctor I work with chose to go back full time despite being able to work part time financially as she found it isolating and boring to be with her child all day, as well as the slow down of her career. Not the norm in the UK (part time is most usual) but different situations suit different people.", "Yeah, is dumb ladies never know what we actually want until mommy hormones set us right. Good thing our husbands know best /s", "That is a good point, thank you for your insight!", "They\u2019ve apparently talked in the past and the husband was fine with the idea of both of them working before", "Disagree, even if it was accidental there was a time when you found out and both decided this is what you wanted, that was the time to have this conversation!\n\nThat being said don\u2019t let him pressure you into changing your mind now! Amazing that you can afford child care so if you value being a part of your business don\u2019t let go of that.", "Remind him that\u2019s it\u2019s called \u201cparenting\u201d, not childcare. Unless he\u2019s need to physically be there for his work, he can figure out a WFH option", "50% him stays at home and 50% of the week you. That's  the corect  way.", "Even if he needs to be physically present most days, he could propably stay home at least 1 or two days a week. If you could do the same that would cut down the time the baby stays in day care greatly and both of you get to keep your job.", "He could close his business and reopen on 5 years of its that important to him. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t get to demand you make sacrifices for his wants.", "I would keep your options open until the baby is actually here. You could find that your already protective streak triples and that you dimply do not trust anybody else. You could find that you have one of those laid back babies that is a regular napper, and content to go with you wherever you go and decide that you can simply take the baby to work with you. If you have other employees with children, you may find that creating an at work daycare space and allowing them to bring their kids to it and sharing the nanny cost to be a very popular idea. Or you might find that you and your spouse are able to work alternate days out and share time.", "I felt like you did and it didn\u2019t change after mine were born.  \nMy kids are the most important things in my life, but I would be miserable as a SAHM, and I\u2019d be pretty terrible at it also. I\u2019ve always believed that quality time with your kids is more important than quantity (with the exception of extreme lack in quantity of course). I spend better time with my kids because I\u2019m not with them 24-7. \nSome moms are great at being SAH and love it. I am not one of those moms.  A happy mom who provides good quality time is much more important than an unhappy mom providing more quantity.", "It\u2019s really not. That bullshit argument assumes you will change your mind with time. It\u2019s different than acknowledging that a woman who gives birth has experienced a very significant life event that can shift her outlook on many things. And involves hormonal changes and changes in brain physiology. That doesn\u2019t mean you can predict what a person will feel like. It means that for many people they feel differently about many things than they did before and it\u2019s ok to bear that in mind.", "Personally, I'm with OP. I am a better parent because I have a career, not in spite  of having a career.  I didn't really have the choice to stay at home, but wouldn't have anyway.  Some people love it, some people find it stifling. \n\nI was very diligent about the quality of his care and made changes when needed.  He's all grown up now and a wonderful human being.  Was it all perfect? Nope.", "That is NOT what I'm saying at all and am a \"dumb lady\" who has had a career and a baby.  My intent is first 100% in support of whatever OP thinks is best for her life and it's not the father's place to dictate she be a SAHM simply because she's the woman. \n\nMy secondary point is of course discuss the plan based on her goals and the family dynamic, but also, wait to pull out the heavy artillery until the baby is actually here.  There are a million unknowns today.", "Those are all good points thank you! We are currently just trying to prepare, and we\u2019re definitely keeping our options open. I\u2019m just trying to prevent standing in a situation where I don\u2019t have the opportunity to work due to lack of planning.", "The last few years have proven that more can be done remotely than thought possible. I did actually stay home with mine till they were in school- but I tend to be a bit of a hermit and loved it. I didn\u2019t get bored till after that and then i worked school hours for the first few years. The benefit of having your own companies is you can create your own rules/schedules, you just have to figure out what works for you, and you won\u2019t know till baby is here what their personality is going to be like. They have it right away. My youngest has been a stereotypical grumpy old man since birth. If he wasn\u2019t in the crib at exactly 7 he fussed all night. But exactly at 7? Sleep a full 10 hours through. At 15 he is turning off lights and turning down the thermostat. They don\u2019t change they just develop."]}
