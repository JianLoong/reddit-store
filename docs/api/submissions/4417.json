Quality day care is great, too. Nothing about having children is set it and forget it.  You have to still keep an eye on everyone involved in your child's upbringing. \n\nYour partner assuming you would shelve your business for 5 years is patriarchal and he needs to join the rest of us in the Year of Our Lord Two thousand and Twenty-two.", "NTA.

And being a SAHP is definitely not for everyone.\n\nAll parents go through the stress and worry of leaving their kids with a stranger. It's a challenge we all face. I suggest you look into structures daycares like Montessori style ones that offer professional services and standards. This allows you child to be safe and be out in the world where they are super stimulated and learn to live within society.\n\nIf you really can't deal with having the kid outside the home perhaps you could suggest that money and daddy split those first 5 years before kindergarten. He takes the first 2.5 years and you take the next or what ever. This way you both get to bond and learn to parent while knowing there is an end date to that commitment. I find having an end date really helps. And it doesn't capsize either of your careers.\n\nAlso this would allow you to consider eventually having more then one kid without indefinitely putting your career on the back burner or paying thousands of dollars a month in home child care.\n\nStaying at home also has a cost as your family income will drop by half while your expenses will go up.", "Obviously not an AH for wanting to have a career.

First of all, OP, this is the kind of conversation you should have before getting pregnant, But anyway, having a baby doesn't mean you have to leave your career aside. If your husband expects you to do it, maybe he should find a way to get some flexibility in his own job and cover some of the hours at home (I know you said he has to physically show up, but having a kid means you BOTH need to sacrifice, your life is going to change.

I prefer being a SAHM, but the economy says otherwise. I will say that jumping back into work so soon was great for me mentally because it maintained a social aspect that I didn't know I needed.

NTA.", "As someone who willingly stayed at home until my son was almost 3, I still would\u2019ve been *pissed* if my partner just assumed I would! \n\nYou make the choice that\u2019s best for you, because staying home with your kiddo feeling miserable is terrible for everyone. It\u2019s 100% ok to love your job and want a life outside of parenting. NTA.", "In a different comment OP stated that they have spoken about this in the past and that her partner didn't have an issue with a sitter. He changed his stance once she got pregnant.", "My husband and I agreed on one situation (both working after first, I would stay home for a few years after second). I panicked at about 6 months with my first and told him I was worried I would want to work with both and he wasn\u2019t supportive. It has caused a lot of problems. \n\nI stayed home to raise both kids and he took advantage of that - he monitored my spending, made comments about how I spent my time, spent many many evenings out doing \u2018work stuff\u2019 (golf, dinners) and I resented him for it.\n\nI now have my doctorate and he really had a hard time with me taking that time but my kids were really proud of me for pursuing it. I have a job I love, my own bank accounts and I am very very protective of my time. Our relationship has its strengths and weaknesses; most of the tensions we have stem from the imbalance of power when I stayed home that he\u2019s never gotten over. Until he\u2019s ready to deal with the way his actions contributed to the less harmonious parts of our relationship, they\u2019ll be there. On an intellectual level he knows my financial independence is due to his behaviour but he hasn\u2019t really thought deeply about how it trickled out to other things too. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t give up your business if you can help it because you don\u2019t want to. Enforce the balance you need - he wants someone home with your child? He can identify how and where he contributes to that. You\u2019ve built up your reputation, business, relationships and so on, it\u2019ll take years to get that back.", "Accident?", "Yeah. Tell him you just ASSUMED he'd do that until the kid's in college.", "Luckily none of us is really taking it that bad. We laughed about the situation and decided to just find a way to make us both content and comfortable. We tied the knot because we love each other and we want to figure things out, this is just one of those things. No bad blood here, just a little miscommunication. I just wanted to know if I was a dick for not wanting to give up my life for my kids, as so many other parents do.", "Same as every other kid with 2 working parents.", "I've also seen way too many financial abuse stories where the man ends up thinking \"my money is money and you can live on $10 a day because I say so\" nonsense.  One recent one had an asshole husband go to the World's Cup with his friend & his friend's girlfriend and just giving OP (his wife) $100 for christmas.", "\"They're not strangers if you do your share of pickup and dropoff, **Craig**.\"", "He changed his mind recently on the subject. They've had the conversation in the past.", "Sounds like a him problem.", "Listen, the way to address his anxiety about strangers is therapy or adjusting his own behavior (ie he stay home). It\u2019s not sacrificing you to it.", "Well, since he changed his mind then I guess he needs to stay home with his real baby.\n\nDon't even entertain his misogynistic bs, OP. Gender and the nature of his work have *nothing* to do with who stays home. NTA", "Lol, he changed his mind and decided you\u2019d drop your business for 5 years without asking you? Yeah, he\u2019s TA.\n\nIf he wants a stay at home parent, he can stay at home himself. Period.", "No plan for raising a child and you think it's some sort of lighthearted jokey topic. This is going to be a fucking mess.", "Don\u2019t bother fighting with this idiot.  They will just bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.  Going back to work and not staying at home is a PERFECTLY valid choice.  Don\u2019t let your husband bully you into changing your mind.", "> their dad couldn't handle it\n\nDon't fall for that plz.", "You might want to look into jobs at daycares.  They pay shit, but you can get a free place for your kid as part of the job.  Then when your kid goes to school you don't have the giant gap on your resume and you at least get a little bit of adult interaction every day.", "One of my good friends's first husband was like this--she gave up her career to stay home with their son, and cashed in all her retirement to clear their debt before he was born, and her husband cheated on her, left her, and then tried to leave her with nothing in the divorce.", "Um, no? If his heart were in the right place, he would have arranged his career to be a SAHD, since that is so crucial to him.", "Now, that's stuck in my head.", "Hey, strangers can make you weary as well.", "I keep seeing things like this and it's getting annoying. They are planning now. Getting things figured out before the child is born. They are having discussions and arguments so that when these things come up later they've hopefully already come to an agreement. That's what you do when a child goes from being a possibility to a reality! Especially a surprise baby! Why people expect a couple to have a detailed plan for a baby they are actively trying to prevent, I'll never know.", "On the contrary. Just two people with financial freedom who are madly in love and starting a family. I\u2019m sorry you sound so bitter, I hope you heal from whatever made you like this.", "She has her own business tho, why would she want a shit job when she enjoys her job and can do it when she wants. Plus it isn't about money in her post but leaving them with a stranger", "He has a year to hire or train one or more people to do the majority of the in person part of his job if he feels that strongly.", "And as others have said--he doesn't *have* to be present every day, he doesn't have meetings every day. *HE* can be a part-time SAHD too.  This isn't the 1940's.  If that's what he wants, great, as they say, split the Baby. So to speak.  Halvesies.  \n\nIf he expects it of you, he can expect it of himself. Otherwise, nope, you get to go back to work. He's being chauvinistic, but I'm glad to see you called him on it.  \n\nYou NTA.", "Since you both seem to have some flexibility with your schedules. Can he stay home 2-3 days and you stay home 2-4. Days ( because his flexibility seems more rigid) or get a sitter for the days that don\u2019t work with your schedules?", "So they should have laid out and agreed to all plans for their child just in case of accidents? And agree not to change their minds about something later? Should they plan the diaper change rota? Who does which feeding? \n\nThey had discussed some parts of potential parenting beforehand. The topic of who will care for the baby while they work just never came up. They are discussing it now.  While they don't agree, they have months to figure out something that works for both. Sounds perfectly reasonable and responsible. Waiting to have this conversation until the baby is 8 months old would be an issue.\n\nWhat world do you live in where no one should argue during a surprise pregnancy? As a former surprise baby, and older sibling to another, I can tell you that world isn't here.", "You're absolutely right. I think I mixed this post up with a different one.", "What are you talking about? The husband never said anything like that.", "Or alternate every other week working in person vs. WFH and baby duty.", "Have you seen the state of mental health in society? You think that has nothing to do with morons continuing to pop out kids they aren't prepared for?", "... yes? What is wrong with you? You're literally asking me if parents should properly prepare for a child.", "Lol it's like talking to a brick wall", "> Have you seen the state of mental health in society? You think that has nothing to do with morons continuing to pop out kids they aren't prepared for?\n\nUh, all human history has dealt with unplanned pregnancies. If anything, due to birth control being more available than ever, i would say there is less accidental pregnancies. \n\nSo to answer your question, a big fat nope! That isn't what's causing the mental health issues of society today. Try again.\n\nEdit: poor little troll couldn't rebuttal my point and could only name call.. awwww, bless their hearts.", "Plans don't last past first contact. And they ARE trying to properly prepare. Why do you think the topic came up now? And prior to this OP's husband had no problem with the idea of a nanny or daycare. Now he feels different. So they are trying to figure it out before it becomes an issue. Why do you have a problem with that?", "K, sorry you're ignorant, not my problem.\n\nYall nutcases love to get the last word in with a personal insult and then block", "K, sorry you think it's ok to just wing it when it comes to parenthood. Good luck.", "Go clutch your pearls over something else hun."]}
