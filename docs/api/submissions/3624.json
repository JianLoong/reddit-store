She is now 5 years old, soon to be 6. \n\n14 months ago I had to move to an apartment that didn't allow pets in the contract. I had no choice but to re-home Pebbles and was heart broken. But my grandma ended up taking her for me, so it wasn't so bad, because I could visit Pebbles any time. She was safe in a house, all indoor, and well taken care of.\n\n3 months ago, grandma died. And of course that was hard enough, but on TOP of that, Pebbles got grabbed without anyone consulting me and brought to my uncle and aunt's house to live. They put her outside with their other farm cats. I drove out on my day off to see her, and she was looking scared and bedraggled. But they insisted she was fine. I went home heartbroken and angry.\n\nRecently I was able to move into a better apartment that's pet friendly with a roommate. I asked if I could have Pebbles back, but my aunt said no, that my cousin's (F15 & F18) have grown attached. But frankly, oh well?? So I said fine, okay. Then last week during work hours, I took off on my lunch break, drove to the farm while they were at work and school, found Pebbles, put her in my car, and drove home to my new apartment.\n\nIt took them two days to even figure she was gone :/ then of course Aunt called me and asked if I had taken Pebbles. I said yes. She started to yell, so I just said 'shes MY cat and I gave her to grandma for a while, not you' and then have Ng up.\n\nI think I'm legally in the clear because I took Pebbles back to the vet I took her to her whole life for a checkup, got her papers up to date, and microchipped her in my name. But my parents called me and told me they were disappointed in me, that it was immature to steal Pebbles and that the girls are apparently heartbroken.\n\nI'm sorry my cousins are sad but I would do it again. Pebbles is MY cat and they weren't taking care of her right. I never wanted to give her up anyway.

They have multiple cats and didn't even notice pebbles was missing, the adults are using this as an excuse to make you feel guilty.  \n\nNTA  Pebbles is your cat and belongs with you. They weren't even taking good care of pebbles, why would you return your cat to people who stole it and didn't take proper care of it?", "NTA. As you said, you temporarily gave her to grandma not them. They shouldn\u2019t have taken Pebbles to begin with. If the cousins are attached that\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s been 3 months ffs. You and pebbles are more attached to each other. Don\u2019t give her back to them. They can go fuck themselves.", "NTA. It took them two days to even notice. They aren\u2019t heartbroken.", "NTA. *Nobody* gave Pebbles to them, they just took her.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nShe's your cat, not theirs. They took her without permission when they knew damn well it was your cat. I somehow doubt your cousins are as heartbroken as it's made out to be, given they didn't even notice she was gone for two whole days. \r  \n\r  \nYou saved your cat's life is what you did.", "NTA\n\nMicrochip is in your name, your Grandma took her for you when you were pressed. Yup she's yours and if it took them 2 days to figure it out, they have no claim.", "NTA. People are pointing out they didn't care because they didn't notice her missing for 2 days, but I was convinced they were a-holes when they TOOK the cat without even telling you and decided their teenagers were too attached to her. You raised that cat for what...4-5 years? That's absolutely insane that they would do that without consulting you. Good for you getting your cat back.", "NTA. If they can go 2 days without even noticing she's gone, then they can go days, weeks, or months between visits. I'm glad you got Pebbles back :)", "NTA. I\u2019d do it too. Police won\u2019t do anything cause it\u2019s a civil matter, so you should be in the clear for that.\n\nETSA: The cat is in YOUR name. They\u2019re SOL. And if the girls cared so much, it wouldn\u2019t take two days to figure out she\u2019s gone.", "NTA, and good for you for collecting your cat from your aunt and uncle. Stealing implies you took something that does not belong to you, but you were simply picking up Pebbles from her temporary accommodations.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA; the only AHs are your aunt and uncle.\n\nI do get why your parents aren\u2019t happy about it, because you rehomed Pebbles, so technically she wasn\u2019t yours anymore, and when your grandma passed, you weren\u2019t in a position to take her, so someone else had to claim ownership.  By your own account, technically I\u2019d say your aunt and uncle do have a logical claim to ownership, so I get why they all feel the way they do.\n\nBut based on what it sounds like is best for Pebbles, I\u2019m on your side.  She spent the first 6 years of her life inside with no other cats or animals around, having domain of the house with her human.  Suddenly chucking her outside *would* be incredibly stressful to her, and depending on the circumstances, could potentially be dangerous.  Your aunt and uncle clearly don\u2019t care about that or what\u2019s best for the cat, and that\u2019s not fair to Pebbles.\n\nSo, while you may have also had selfish motivations, you\u2019re the only one who seems to have been acting in Pebbles\u2019s best interest.  And for that, you\u2019re NTA.\n\nETA: when I say you also have selfish motives, I don\u2019t mean to imply that you aren\u2019t justified in having that motive (upon rereading I realized it sounded like I was saying you\u2019d be a dick for feeling that way).  Just that, while some of your motivations may have been selfish, that\u2019s not an argument for why you should be TA.

(If anything, you\u2019re the asshole for *not* taking Pebbles home the first time you saw what kind of shape she was in.)", "NTA - In my country the law says that a cat with no ear tattoo or chip is by definition homeless, and it's completely legal to take the cat in and register it in your own name = The cat is legally yours. Don't know where you live, so don't know what the rules are in your country.\nLaws aside, I would have done the same thing. If the cat is better off living with you, let the humans be mad for a while, and take good care of your cat and give it a safe, happy life!", "NTA People are, if nothing else, very good at taking things which are not theirs and then retro fitting things to justify their actions. It's not your fault your cousins are upset.", "NTA \n\nThey didn\u2019t even notice her missing for two days?? Apparently they are not as attached as they claim they are! \ud83d\ude02\n\nYour cat.

I'm glad to hear that you got your beloved cat back, and that your cat is with an owner that will treat her well.\n\nBe careful to tell the story to your roommate, watch out in case your aunt/uncle come around and want to steal her again.", "Why are you even asking us if you\u2019re fine with being the asshole?\n\nBut for the record, I don't think you are. Your grandmother was keeping the cat for you, as far as I understood it. Although the laws in your state might have given your grandmother legal ownership, I think the understanding was that, had she been alive when you finally found a place where you could keep Pebbles, she would have given her back to you.\n\nHowever, your uncle and aunt simply absconded with Pebbles, with no one\u2019s permission. In my state, if you feed an animal for ten days, you own it. Which may give them legal rights to Pebbles.\n\nBut it sounds like either these rights don\u2019t apply in your state, or your aunt and uncle aren\u2019t going to assert them. They might not even know about their rights.\n\nBut I would say from a moral standpoint, you\u2019re in the right. How attached could your cousins have been if they didn\u2019t even notice for two days?\n\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth, I say NTA. It sounds like Pebbles is much safer with you.", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that your cousins got attached to the cat, they are kids after all, but kids also get sidetracked quickly, so they'll get over it quickly, especially since it sounds like they have other cats anyways.  They may be \"heartbroken\" but that will last for about two days until they move on to the next thing, they'll be fine and they can come visit if they really want (they won't).\n\nSeems like whoever decided to give the cat to your aunt should have at least checked with you first, and seems like your aunt is being an AH about the whole thing.", "NTA they had no right to take YOUR cat.", "NTA. I would have done the exact same thing. Putting a cat that has been indoors all its life outside is cruel. Heck, I would have gotten in a slap fight to get the cat if it came to it.", "Absolutely NTA.  She was YOUR cat and never meant for her to go to your aunt and uncle", "As a cat owner, I don't really understand why you would move to a apartment that doesn't allow pets when you have a cat. But regardless NTA.", "NTA! It took them 2 whole days. That's your cat, your aunt is a huge AH", "NTA.  My son had to leave his cat in my care while he's in the military.  We both love this cat SO much.  This sweet, tiny panther will likely be with me for a couple of years.  He's still my son's cat.  I'm merely a temporary guardian. \n\nYour grandma was looking after YOUR cat.  No one else had any right to claim her.  You rescued your baby from the negligent humans who stole her.
