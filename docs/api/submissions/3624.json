She is now 5 years old, soon to be 6. \n\n14 months ago I had to move to an apartment that didn't allow pets in the contract. I had no choice but to re-home Pebbles and was heart broken. But my grandma ended up taking her for me, so it wasn't so bad, because I could visit Pebbles any time. She was safe in a house, all indoor, and well taken care of.\n\n3 months ago, grandma died. And of course that was hard enough, but on TOP of that, Pebbles got grabbed without anyone consulting me and brought to my uncle and aunt's house to live. They put her outside with their other farm cats. I drove out on my day off to see her, and she was looking scared and bedraggled. But they insisted she was fine. I went home heartbroken and angry.\n\nRecently I was able to move into a better apartment that's pet friendly with a roommate. I asked if I could have Pebbles back, but my aunt said no, that my cousin's (F15 & F18) have grown attached. But frankly, oh well?? So I said fine, okay. Then last week during work hours, I took off on my lunch break, drove to the farm while they were at work and school, found Pebbles, put her in my car, and drove home to my new apartment.\n\nIt took them two days to even figure she was gone :/ then of course Aunt called me and asked if I had taken Pebbles. I said yes. She started to yell, so I just said 'shes MY cat and I gave her to grandma for a while, not you' and then have Ng up.\n\nI think I'm legally in the clear because I took Pebbles back to the vet I took her to her whole life for a checkup, got her papers up to date, and microchipped her in my name. But my parents called me and told me they were disappointed in me, that it was immature to steal Pebbles and that the girls are apparently heartbroken.\n\nI'm sorry my cousins are sad but I would do it again. Pebbles is MY cat and they weren't taking care of her right. I never wanted to give her up anyway.

They have multiple cats and didn't even notice pebbles was missing, the adults are using this as an excuse to make you feel guilty.  \n\nNTA  Pebbles is your cat and belongs with you. They weren't even taking good care of pebbles, why would you return your cat to people who stole it and didn't take proper care of it?", "NTA. As you said, you temporarily gave her to grandma not them. They shouldn\u2019t have taken Pebbles to begin with. If the cousins are attached that\u2019s too bad. It\u2019s been 3 months ffs. You and pebbles are more attached to each other. Don\u2019t give her back to them. They can go fuck themselves.", "NTA. It took them two days to even notice. They aren\u2019t heartbroken.", "NTA. *Nobody* gave Pebbles to them, they just took her.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nShe's your cat, not theirs. They took her without permission when they knew damn well it was your cat. I somehow doubt your cousins are as heartbroken as it's made out to be, given they didn't even notice she was gone for two whole days. \r  \n\r  \nYou saved your cat's life is what you did.", "NTA\n\nMicrochip is in your name, your Grandma took her for you when you were pressed. Yup she's yours and if it took them 2 days to figure it out, they have no claim.", "NTA. People are pointing out they didn't care because they didn't notice her missing for 2 days, but I was convinced they were a-holes when they TOOK the cat without even telling you and decided their teenagers were too attached to her. You raised that cat for what...4-5 years? That's absolutely insane that they would do that without consulting you. Good for you getting your cat back.", "NTA. If they can go 2 days without even noticing she's gone, then they can go days, weeks, or months between visits. I'm glad you got Pebbles back :)", "NTA. I\u2019d do it too. Police won\u2019t do anything cause it\u2019s a civil matter, so you should be in the clear for that.\n\nETSA: The cat is in YOUR name. They\u2019re SOL. And if the girls cared so much, it wouldn\u2019t take two days to figure out she\u2019s gone.", "NTA, and good for you for collecting your cat from your aunt and uncle. Stealing implies you took something that does not belong to you, but you were simply picking up Pebbles from her temporary accommodations.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA; the only AHs are your aunt and uncle.\n\nI do get why your parents aren\u2019t happy about it, because you rehomed Pebbles, so technically she wasn\u2019t yours anymore, and when your grandma passed, you weren\u2019t in a position to take her, so someone else had to claim ownership.  By your own account, technically I\u2019d say your aunt and uncle do have a logical claim to ownership, so I get why they all feel the way they do.\n\nBut based on what it sounds like is best for Pebbles, I\u2019m on your side.  She spent the first 6 years of her life inside with no other cats or animals around, having domain of the house with her human.  Suddenly chucking her outside *would* be incredibly stressful to her, and depending on the circumstances, could potentially be dangerous.  Your aunt and uncle clearly don\u2019t care about that or what\u2019s best for the cat, and that\u2019s not fair to Pebbles.\n\nSo, while you may have also had selfish motivations, you\u2019re the only one who seems to have been acting in Pebbles\u2019s best interest.  And for that, you\u2019re NTA.\n\nETA: when I say you also have selfish motives, I don\u2019t mean to imply that you aren\u2019t justified in having that motive (upon rereading I realized it sounded like I was saying you\u2019d be a dick for feeling that way).  Just that, while some of your motivations may have been selfish, that\u2019s not an argument for why you should be TA.

(If anything, you\u2019re the asshole for *not* taking Pebbles home the first time you saw what kind of shape she was in.)", "NTA - In my country the law says that a cat with no ear tattoo or chip is by definition homeless, and it's completely legal to take the cat in and register it in your own name = The cat is legally yours. Don't know where you live, so don't know what the rules are in your country.\nLaws aside, I would have done the same thing. If the cat is better off living with you, let the humans be mad for a while, and take good care of your cat and give it a safe, happy life!", "NTA People are, if nothing else, very good at taking things which are not theirs and then retro fitting things to justify their actions. It's not your fault your cousins are upset.", "NTA \n\nThey didn\u2019t even notice her missing for two days?? Apparently they are not as attached as they claim they are! \ud83d\ude02\n\nYour cat.

I'm glad to hear that you got your beloved cat back, and that your cat is with an owner that will treat her well.\n\nBe careful to tell the story to your roommate, watch out in case your aunt/uncle come around and want to steal her again.", "Why are you even asking us if you\u2019re fine with being the asshole?\n\nBut for the record, I don't think you are. Your grandmother was keeping the cat for you, as far as I understood it. Although the laws in your state might have given your grandmother legal ownership, I think the understanding was that, had she been alive when you finally found a place where you could keep Pebbles, she would have given her back to you.\n\nHowever, your uncle and aunt simply absconded with Pebbles, with no one\u2019s permission. In my state, if you feed an animal for ten days, you own it. Which may give them legal rights to Pebbles.\n\nBut it sounds like either these rights don\u2019t apply in your state, or your aunt and uncle aren\u2019t going to assert them. They might not even know about their rights.\n\nBut I would say from a moral standpoint, you\u2019re in the right. How attached could your cousins have been if they didn\u2019t even notice for two days?\n\nFor whatever it\u2019s worth, I say NTA. It sounds like Pebbles is much safer with you.", "NTA\n\nIt's understandable that your cousins got attached to the cat, they are kids after all, but kids also get sidetracked quickly, so they'll get over it quickly, especially since it sounds like they have other cats anyways.  They may be \"heartbroken\" but that will last for about two days until they move on to the next thing, they'll be fine and they can come visit if they really want (they won't).\n\nSeems like whoever decided to give the cat to your aunt should have at least checked with you first, and seems like your aunt is being an AH about the whole thing.", "NTA they had no right to take YOUR cat.", "NTA. I would have done the exact same thing. Putting a cat that has been indoors all its life outside is cruel. Heck, I would have gotten in a slap fight to get the cat if it came to it.", "Absolutely NTA.  She was YOUR cat and never meant for her to go to your aunt and uncle", "As a cat owner, I don't really understand why you would move to a apartment that doesn't allow pets when you have a cat. But regardless NTA.", "NTA! It took them 2 whole days. That's your cat, your aunt is a huge AH", "NTA.  My son had to leave his cat in my care while he's in the military.  We both love this cat SO much.  This sweet, tiny panther will likely be with me for a couple of years.  He's still my son's cat.  I'm merely a temporary guardian. \n\nYour grandma was looking after YOUR cat.  No one else had any right to claim her.  You rescued your baby from the negligent humans who stole her.

That pretty much cuts an cats life expectancy in half.", "Absolutely NTA, if my kitty was in a situation like that, I would have even called the A-Team, lol.\nAlso, as customary, you owe the cat-tax! Where's the picture of Pebbles? :)", "Remmy says NTA. Farm cat life is mean streets", "You did the right thing by rescuing your cat.", "NTA- Putting an indoor cat outdoors is stupid and dangerous. Additionally, if they were really as attached to Pebbles as your aunt said, they'd have noticed she was gone right away.", "Nta, Pebbles is your cat and you should have been consulted regarding any re-homing.\n\nAlso, it sounds like they did not and did not plan on bringing Pebbles to a vet. How attached can they be to a cat they leave entirely outside to fend for itself? Not that cats aren't capable, but it'd certainly be an adjustment for most used to staying safe indoors", "NTA they should have asked you first.", "If your cousins are sad, it's your aunt and uncle's fault. They stole a cat and allowed the kids to get attached to it. Their kids' heartbreak is the consequence of their parents' own actions coming back around. NTA in the slightest.", "NTA Thank you for being a committed and loving caretaker of your sweet furbaby.", "NTA. \n\nAunt and Uncle are AH\u2019s for claiming to love it but dumping it outside", "NTA. Keep a tight grip on that cat and I'd caution you against giving a copy of your key to any family member in the chances of them being cajoled by your aunt to steal Pebbles back.", "NTA But legally you did steal her. I\u2019m on a farm. Farm cats generally don\u2019t have good lives so for that, and because she was yours initially, I\u2019ll let you have this win.", "NTA\n\nYou saved Pebbles. Plus I\u2019m sure your family knows that Pebbles belongs to you and you to her.", "NTA\n\nI would notice if my dog was gone for 2 minutes. They obviously don\u2019t give a fuck about that cat and it\u2019s a lot better off in your care. Plus it sounds like they have a shit ton of other pets too.", "Should have just said no, and \u2018you didn\u2019t leave her outside where a wild animal could get her, did you?\u2019 \nNTA", "NTA. You did the right thing!!\n\nA good friend of mine had a roommate who got a kitten. She was starving the poor thing because she didn't want a \"fat cat.\" (Seriously starving it) My friend would feed it while she wasn't looking. But, she went on a vacation and was worried about it. Said roommate was moving out over a period of a few days. I asked to use a spare key to go check on it and her home. I found it in such an appalling state. Litterbox with no litter and full of a ton of waste, no food, and the kitten chewed through plastic containers trying to get to food. It was just wailing and clinging to me.\n\nYou bet your tush I took that kitten. Told my friend to give her my number and come to me if she had a problem. The woman text me in a rage saying it had \"only been left for two days\" and kittens can go 48 hours alone. She said she left food but it was fat (it was underweight) and probably ate it in one sitting. I rehomed it and there was nothing she could do about it.\n\nIn the end, who cares what people like that say. Glad you got your cat back. It wasn't a farm cat. And it took them TWO DAYS to notice!! I guess your cousins weren't so attached to pay attention to it every day. Urgh.", "NTA\n\nThe cat should\u2019ve gone back to you anyway. And cats raised indoors *do not do well* if forced to live outside.", "^ That's exactly what happened. This wasn't theft, it was a *rescue* mission.\n\nOP, you did what you had to do as the person who promised Pebbles she'd always be loved, cared for, and safe. It's a promise any loving owner makes, and I know you are one.\n\nMy heart breaks thinking of what Pebbles went through. She went from a safe and familiar environment, with people she knew and trusted, to an environment she had no experience with, including how to survive. Yes, cats have amazing instincts, but they are also creatures of habit. Everything she knew was suddenly no more. She had to have been terrified. \n\nI lost my cat a few months ago. She was a feral I tamed, who became the biggest lap cat in existence. Circumstances meant I had to leave her at my parents, and like you, I visited all the time. I was able to eventually bring her home with me. If I instead went through what you did..... Let's just say 'hell hath no fury.'\n\nPebbles is finally at home with you, right where she belongs.", "I actually teared up reading this sentence because it is true.", "Right? I had an outdoor cat (before anyone gets on me, she was outside as a kitten and would *not* adjust to being an indoor cat). I noticed the first night she went missing.", "It always makes me sad when people do completely reasonable things and then parents or someone else close to them (but not directly involved in the situation) jumps in to tell them they\u2019re wrong. Sorry that happened! Enjoy having your pet back!", "Choosing between a beloved pet and homelessness is not a choice I'd judge anyone for and wouldn't even wish on my enemies.", "now i\u2019m sitting here heartbroken imagining a cat being bullied by other cats\ud83d\udc94", "Legally, you are not in the clear. You can\u2019t just take a cat and get it chipped afterwards in your name. You trespassed and stole property (pets are property in court) in dispute. depending on where you got the cat from the adoption contract May have stated you can\u2019t teh one and must return cat if can\u2019t keep it so in theory when you wrongly gave to grandma in violation the cat belongs to rescue. Also, What was in grandmas will? If she mentioned where the pets should go that would take precedent if the rescue did not have the no rehome clause in the adoption contract.", "Putting any domestic cat outside is a horrible idea. Theyre an invasive species that devastates the ecosystem AND its dangerous for them.", "Pebbles! Pebbles! Pebbles!", "My cat was making a ruckus last night and I just figured she was in the one closet she likes opening and climbing around in.\n\nThen she started crying.  So I called for her and she wasn\u2019t coming.  So after a minute of calling and her just crying, I went to investigate because it\u2019s not like her.  Stupid loaf got herself trapped in a box.\n\nI\u2019d definitely notice if she went missing for longer than normal.", "With cats, I'd probably think an hour maybe two max depending on the cat before it's unreasonable to not go looking.", "Some cats are able to manage just fine outdoors and have long lives. But those are cats who\u2019ve been raised outdoors since they were kittens. An adult cat who\u2019s never been outdoors being made to live outside is just cruel and basically guarantees a dead cat.", "But isn\u2019t anything what happened in between op getting the contract from adoption agency and now hearsay? How would the aunt and uncle have any record that they had possession of the cat?", "I disagree\u2026 seeing as the cat was never given, but temporarily rehomed due to living accommodations.", "Oh, I wholeheartedly agree. But the last time I brought up what they do to the native bird population, I got into a lengthy argument with a guy who kept telling me that I'm a hypocrite because I eat chicken.", "Humans are the worst invasive species, but no one ever mentions that.", "My cat freaks out if she\u2019s taken outside.\n\nSit on the balcony on her terms?  Fine, no problems.\n\nHas to actually leave the building - absolutely not, full meltdown.  She\u2019d never survive.", "I was watching some documentary on cats years ago and I remember the statistic was average cat life span for indoor cats is 12-18 years, while outdoor cat average is only like 3-5.", "She got cat chipped after she stole it after trespassing onto their property. Grandmas will and or any rehome terms in the original adoption contract from the rescue is what matters", "Last time i checked, sparrows arent raised for to be pot pies.\n\nBut what do i know? Ive only worked at a feed and grain store for 3 months.", "I had a cat who would flip his shit if you put him on grass.  The deck was fine, but the second the grass touched his belly he was OUT.  I think it tickled him", "only if no one takes care of them, I had a cat survive for 12 years outside. He grew up outside and I already had cats in the house or I would have let him in, but he didn't seemed to mind, made him a little enclosure and everything.", "That number comes from quite an old study with ambiguous methodology, and location does vary a lot. A farm cat is probably less likely to be run over than an urban cat, for instance. And, sadly, as with historical numbers on human life expectancy, the life expectancy increases a lot for those who have already reached 1 year old. Lifespan is absolutely longer on average for indoor cats, it's just likely not *as* drastic as is often stated.\n\nHaving said that, it is horribly cruel to put an indoor cat into an outdoor life, *especially* what sounds like an entirely outdoor life, and OP was absolutely NTA."]}
