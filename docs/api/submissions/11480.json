This is exactly how you handle such things. He wants your labor, so he has to pay for it.", "NTA. He was already burning the bridge the moment you left. You didn't do anything wrong here and it's great you found a place way better than the toxic place you left.", "NTA.  Don't give free labor to this AH and don't compromise on your price.  Honestly, unless you're in dire need there is no amount of money I could reasonably expect to do anything for that guy at this point.  What a clown.", "NTA He is trying to take advantage.", "NTA I know how it feels.

Protect yourself and your family. That\u2019s what your former employer is doing.", "Of course NTA.

This isn't about greed on your behalf.  You would have to give them help in your personal time - not in your new company's time - which would take time away from your family.  Your ex-manager is delusional in the extreme.  \n\nIt obviously sucks for your former co-worker that she is struggling but that is the company's problem and not yours\n\n**EDIT** just wanted to add, if your ex-manager comes crawling back and agrees to pay you the rate you quoted.  **Insist** on payment upfront before you do any work or its no deal.

If I were the co-worker I would be looking for another job, too.\n\nIf, for some reason, you *do* come to fair terms and decide to help out, get a contract that lays out your rate, number of hours per week and payment schedule.  You'll need that in writing for when he refuses to pay you for your time and you need to sue him.", "NTA! You deserve to get paid for your work. Your former boss decided to be an ass when you asked if you could have your job back. He\u2019s toxic and doesn\u2019t value his employees, but expects unquestioning loyalty.
