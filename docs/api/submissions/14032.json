He said that he was saving it for lunch tomorrow, that he had never met anyone who would do anything like this, and was just generally really upset. I thought he was joking and laughed it off, but it\u2019s been a couple hours and he is still upset. He\u2019s talking about how he was looking forwards to having the leftover pizza for lunch, and now I\u2019ve ruined his lunch.\n\nI offered to buy him another pizza, but he kept saying that it wasn\u2019t about that, and I just ruined his day. \n\nIs he overreacting or AITA?", "created_utc": 1680669574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c8kav/aita_for_eating_the_toppings_off_my_bfs_pizza/", "score": 8357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should apologize, sincerely, and pay for a new pizza. Acting so flippant over a meal you selfishly ruined makes you childish.", "YTA. If you're still hungry, you eat another piece, you don't ruin all the remaining pieces. SMH", "YTA you couldn't have taken another slice? Who just eats the toppings and leaves the pizza? I'd have been upset too if I was in his place.", "YTA\n\nThis is truly unhinged behavior.", "Yeah, YTA.  Who eats all the toppings off of leftover pizza and thinks everyone else should be happy to eat what you've left behind?  If he wanted a plain pizza, he'd have ordered it that way.  And laughing about it when he objected to your behavior is probably what set him off.  Have you actually known other people who DIDN'T have an issue with you doing this?!?", "INFO: Why do you think that was acceptable? Why didn\u2019t you just eat another slice?", "YTA. By eating only the toppings, you pretty much wasted the rest of the pizza. A large portion of the pizza is just garbage now. If you're hungry, eat another slice instead of wasting half-a-pizza that you knew, or should have known, someone would still eat.", "What kind of monster just eats the toppings off the left over pizza? Just eat another slice of pizza? But no, you choose to ruin the rest? Do you eat toppingless pizza normally?", "YTA - if you\u2019re sharing food with someone, it\u2019s common courtesy to talk to the other person before doing anything with it. Him blowing up about it was a bit over the top, but since according to you you were laughing at him being upset and never even apologized, it\u2019s understandable.", "YTA that\u2019s like taking all the M and Ms out of the trail mix or all the marshmallows out of the lucky charms. Whoever eats the other slices has to eat your finger pickings and gets no toppings. It\u2019s inconsiderate and rude", "YTA, do you also eat all the skin off the whole bucket of KFC like Cartman did on Southpark? I can understand doing this if it's your own food and you aren't able to take your leftovers home, like if I have a few bites of sandwich left I might pull out just the filling to eat. Taking all the toppings off of slices that someone else would have been happy to eat whole is just incredibly rude. It makes me wonder if maybe you're an only child and not used to sharing with others? \n\nWhen your boyfriend says it's not about the pizza, what he means is that you are a thoughtless person who doesn't think of how their actions effect others. It says to him that you are selfish, wasteful, and illogical. You could have had another slice if you weren't full, but instead of doing that, you made the entire rest of the pizza inedible. It would have been one thing if you finished the whole thing and left him nothing, but you took all the best parts for yourself leaving him the dried, discarded scraps you might feed to a dog. \n\nI remember a scene from a show, (I think it might have been The Good Place?) ****Edit- it was \"This is Us\"*** where two characters are talking about sharing a plate of nachos. The one character wants to share and doesn't see why the other one doesn't, but he tells her it's because she always takes all the biggest, cheesiest, most loaded up chips. She leaves him nothing but salty, soggy crumbs and doesn't even notice. She's so selfish that it never occurred to her that always taking the best ones for herself made it a shitty experience for her partner. I don't think that you meant to hurt your BF, but you might need to be more thoughtful going forward.", "YTA, monster.", "YTA, who tf does that? You should have at least asked him before.   \nI was honestly about to scroll past but when I skimmed it I was so shocked that I had to come actually read it and I'm still shocked lol. It's not *that* big of a deal, but it is very bizarre.", "YTA.  If you are hungry, you take another slice.  The leftovers are useless now, because it's nothing but the base.  You wasted the rest of the pizza.", "I mean\u2026 it\u2019s pretty inconsiderate. Why didn\u2019t you just eat another piece? Did you buy the pizza and share with him? Who paid for the pizza?  I would be pretty appalled and think you were rude AF but I don\u2019t think I would have had such a reaction, so probably ESH.", "YTA. It really really annoys me when someone does this. Why not just have another slice? You\u2019re wasting food by doing this and seeing food being wasted like this will piss anyone off.", "YTA and you should still buy him lunch. At least TRY to fix what you did. Admit to him that you were the AH and don't do it again.\n\nYou ruined half a pizza. Not to mention wasting food. I doubt that anyone would eat what's left", "Are you 4? YTA", "U know u are yta why not just eat another slice", "YTA. Gross. Why eat just the toppings and not another slice? What's the point?", "YTA!! what a waste of pizza. You ruined the rest of the pizza, instead of just eating a slice.", "YTA. You didn't even ask (and its a bit weird just to eat the toppings), just ruined the pizza instead. Didn't you stop to think he might want it later?", "ESH,\n\nHe\u2019s overacting but you\u2019re actually an insane person, you literally Cartman\u2019d the pizza.", "Why would you eat just toppings if you were hungry? I\u2019d be pretty peeved if I opened up leftover pizza and it was literally just cheese sauce and bread, like just take a slice lmao \n\nThough his reaction from what I can tell seems kinda over the top so I\u2019ll give it an ESH.", "Gross and rude. YTA. Ewwww!", "YTA who does that with a shared pizza?", "YTA. Incredibly INCONSIDERATE move on your part! You should absolutely buy him another pizza as well as an apology.", "YTA. Who the hell shares a pizza, then goes and eats the toppings off of the rest of it? That's as mentally unsound as standing up to wipe.", "YTA wtf are you a toddler? Also gross getting your fingers all over the pizza and popping them in your mouth. So vile.", "YTA. Ew. So gross.", "YTA. That\u2019s ridiculously rude and childish", "YTA. Are you Cartman with the fried chicken skin, or what?", "YTA\n\nYou either eat the slice or something else. It\u2019s disgusting seeing good that someone has picked bits out of or taken random bites out of.", "INFO\n\nDid you pay for the pizza? If he did, YTA twice over. First for what you did and second for acting like he's overreacting because of it. If you paid, ESH because it's an incredibly shitty thing to ruin the rest of the food by just picking out the best parts instead of just getting another serving, but he'd be an AH too for complaining about it if he didn't pay for it.", "ESH.\n\nI don't think he should be flipping out over it, but it's pretty selfish of you. Just eat a slice, don't ruin all the other slices just because you want to eat toppings only.", "YTA.\n\nYou know YTA. You offered to buy another pizza and he turned you down because what you did was rude and selfish.\n\nPut yourself in his shoes, you get your favorite order from your favorite restaurant. Your (hopefully ex) boyfriend digs through it to pick out his favorite pieces and leaves you the picked over meal.\n\nWhen you confront him about it, he laughs at you because it's no big deal to him. How would you feel?", "NTA. Who cares. Buy another. Do you both live under a bridge?", "Calling you TA is a bit too hars. Both is true. Unnecessary thing to do but to overreact like this is childish. He should just say that he doesn\u2019t like it when you do X and be understanding that you may be used to do X and now you have to accept that your not alone anymore. And if you do X again then you have to be doing it to piss him off. But to overreact the first time someone does anything is in my worldview more of a red flag than somebody eating the topping only", "ESH. You're the Ah for eating the topping and making the rest of the pizza a waste. He's the AH for how he flipped out and if he never communicated he wanted to keep the pizza.\n\nSide note: If he flips out over pizza after dating for one month, get the fuck out.", "ESH.\n\nIn defense of your BF, I wouldn\u2019t want to eat a pizza that someone else poked their fingers into. Eating another slice would have been a better choice. \n\nBut you ruined his day? That\u2019s just silly, especially since you offered to buy a fresh pizza.", "YTA. That\u2019s like eating all the frosting off of a cupcake and being like \u201cbut you still have the cake.\u201d", "So when there's leftover cake, and your still hungry, do you scrape the icing off or do you cut another piece of cake. YTA", "Unpopular opinions but def NTA, if the pizza was up for grabs you can eat it however you want, even if it\u2019s weird. \n\nPlus you offered to buy him a whole other one.", "OOF, break up : (", "I'll go against the grain and say nta but I also pick toppings off when I get full. You offered to buy another one he refused let it be whatever", "Asshole or no, why tf is everyone here acting like cheese pizza is going to give you food poisoning? It\u2019s still fucking pizza, man. There are some people, myself included, who PREFER pizza that is just sauce, crust, and cheese.", "Annoying, yes but your bf\u2019s reaction is cause for concern. Everyone makes mistakes \u2026 look for a partner who will have a discussion instead of a temper tantrum/silent treatment. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just a pizza.\n\nNTA", "Ynta, he overreacted, you shouldn\u2019t have eaten the toppings but he didn\u2019t need to react the way he did", "I often wonder about long term you know what i read in relationship subs when someone does something considered a 'small' act.\n\n If you do what you yourself consider a small thing ie picking off the toppings and ruining it and your reaction to it to his reaction is at the time not much.  Okay then.\n\n\nHe's right, it's not just about the pizza, it's bigger things ahead in the relationship. You didn't ask, in a way it's disrespect.\n\nThink about a small thing the opposite way, you wanted the toppings and he shared his with you. It's  a small thing but you'd say \" aww my man loves me to do that \"\n\n You've shown him something about you he doesn't like and the stardust has fallen from his eyes a little. \n He's a right to be annoyed but 2 hours  is a lot though to be angry and to be frank, I'd be thinking hard here too.\n\nBut ESH in your act and reaction and his long over reaction.", "ESH, don\u2019t desecrate a pizza like that and your bf shouldn\u2019t overreact to something as simple as food. He can still eat it, just with no toppings. If something as little as eating toppings on a pizza will ruin his day then maybe reevaluate your relationship.", "INFO: did you eat the cheese off, too? \u2018Cause I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal if you just ate the pineapple and meat. I\u2019d hardly say the remaining cheese pizza is ruined or inedible.", "a little weird but NTA. if you hadn\u2019t offered to buy more pizza for him it would be different, but he\u2019s pouting over nothing at this point.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
