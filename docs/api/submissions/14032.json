He said that he was saving it for lunch tomorrow, that he had never met anyone who would do anything like this, and was just generally really upset. I thought he was joking and laughed it off, but it\u2019s been a couple hours and he is still upset. He\u2019s talking about how he was looking forwards to having the leftover pizza for lunch, and now I\u2019ve ruined his lunch.\n\nI offered to buy him another pizza, but he kept saying that it wasn\u2019t about that, and I just ruined his day. \n\nIs he overreacting or AITA?", "created_utc": 1680669574, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12c8kav/aita_for_eating_the_toppings_off_my_bfs_pizza/", "score": 725, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should apologize, sincerely, and pay for a new pizza. Acting so flippant over a meal you selfishly ruined makes you childish.", "YTA. If you're still hungry, you eat another piece, you don't ruin all the remaining pieces. SMH", "YTA you couldn't have taken another slice? Who just eats the toppings and leaves the pizza? I'd have been upset too if I was in his place.", "YTA\n\nThis is truly unhinged behavior.", "Yeah, YTA.  Who eats all the toppings off of leftover pizza and thinks everyone else should be happy to eat what you've left behind?  If he wanted a plain pizza, he'd have ordered it that way.  And laughing about it when he objected to your behavior is probably what set him off.  Have you actually known other people who DIDN'T have an issue with you doing this?!?", "INFO: Why do you think that was acceptable? Why didn\u2019t you just eat another slice?", "YTA. By eating only the toppings, you pretty much wasted the rest of the pizza. A large portion of the pizza is just garbage now. If you're hungry, eat another slice instead of wasting half-a-pizza that you knew, or should have known, someone would still eat.", "What kind of monster just eats the toppings off the left over pizza? Just eat another slice of pizza? But no, you choose to ruin the rest? Do you eat toppingless pizza normally?", "YTA - if you\u2019re sharing food with someone, it\u2019s common courtesy to talk to the other person before doing anything with it. Him blowing up about it was a bit over the top, but since according to you you were laughing at him being upset and never even apologized, it\u2019s understandable.", "YTA that\u2019s like taking all the M and Ms out of the trail mix or all the marshmallows out of the lucky charms. Whoever eats the other slices has to eat your finger pickings and gets no toppings. It\u2019s inconsiderate and rude", "YTA, do you also eat all the skin off the whole bucket of KFC like Cartman did on Southpark? I can understand doing this if it's your own food and you aren't able to take your leftovers home, like if I have a few bites of sandwich left I might pull out just the filling to eat. Taking all the toppings off of slices that someone else would have been happy to eat whole is just incredibly rude. It makes me wonder if maybe you're an only child and not used to sharing with others? \n\nWhen your boyfriend says it's not about the pizza, what he means is that you are a thoughtless person who doesn't think of how their actions effect others. It says to him that you are selfish, wasteful, and illogical. You could have had another slice if you weren't full, but instead of doing that, you made the entire rest of the pizza inedible. It would have been one thing if you finished the whole thing and left him nothing, but you took all the best parts for yourself leaving him the dried, discarded scraps you might feed to a dog. \n\nI remember a scene from a show, (I think it might have been The Good Place?) where two characters are talking about sharing a plate of nachos. The one character wants to share and doesn't see why the other one doesn't, but he tells her it's because she always takes all the biggest, cheesiest, most loaded up chips. She leaves him nothing but salty, soggy crumbs and doesn't even notice. She's so selfish that it never occurred to her that always taking the best ones for herself made it a shitty experience for her partner. I don't think that you meant to hurt your BF, but you might need to be more thoughtful going forward.", "YTA, monster.", "YTA, who tf does that? You should have at least asked him before.   \nI was honestly about to scroll past but when I skimmed it I was so shocked that I had to come actually read it and I'm still shocked lol. It's not *that* big of a deal, but it is very bizarre.", "YTA.  If you are hungry, you take another slice.  The leftovers are useless now, because it's nothing but the base.  You wasted the rest of the pizza.", "I mean\u2026 it\u2019s pretty inconsiderate. Why didn\u2019t you just eat another piece? Did you buy the pizza and share with him? Who paid for the pizza?  I would be pretty appalled and think you were rude AF but I don\u2019t think I would have had such a reaction, so probably ESH.", "YTA. It really really annoys me when someone does this. Why not just have another slice? You\u2019re wasting food by doing this and seeing food being wasted like this will piss anyone off.", "YTA and you should still buy him lunch. At least TRY to fix what you did. Admit to him that you were the AH and don't do it again.\n\nYou ruined half a pizza. Not to mention wasting food. I doubt that anyone would eat what's left", "Are you 4? YTA", "U know u are yta why not just eat another slice", "YTA. Gross. Why eat just the toppings and not another slice? What's the point?", "YTA!! what a waste of pizza. You ruined the rest of the pizza, instead of just eating a slice.", "YTA. You didn't even ask (and its a bit weird just to eat the toppings), just ruined the pizza instead. Didn't you stop to think he might want it later?", "ESH,\n\nHe\u2019s overacting but you\u2019re actually an insane person, you literally Cartman\u2019d the pizza.", "Why would you eat just toppings if you were hungry? I\u2019d be pretty peeved if I opened up leftover pizza and it was literally just cheese sauce and bread, like just take a slice lmao \n\nThough his reaction from what I can tell seems kinda over the top so I\u2019ll give it an ESH.", "Gross and rude. YTA. Ewwww!", "YTA who does that with a shared pizza?", "YTA. Incredibly INCONSIDERATE move on your part! You should absolutely buy him another pizza as well as an apology.", "YTA. Who the hell shares a pizza, then goes and eats the toppings off of the rest of it? That's as mentally unsound as standing up to wipe.", "YTA wtf are you a toddler? Also gross getting your fingers all over the pizza and popping them in your mouth. So vile.", "YTA. Ew. So gross.", "YTA. That\u2019s ridiculously rude and childish", "YTA. Are you Cartman with the fried chicken skin, or what?", "YTA\n\nYou either eat the slice or something else. It\u2019s disgusting seeing good that someone has picked bits out of or taken random bites out of.", "INFO\n\nDid you pay for the pizza? If he did, YTA twice over. First for what you did and second for acting like he's overreacting because of it. If you paid, ESH because it's an incredibly shitty thing to ruin the rest of the food by just picking out the best parts instead of just getting another serving, but he'd be an AH too for complaining about it if he didn't pay for it.", "ESH.\n\nI don't think he should be flipping out over it, but it's pretty selfish of you. Just eat a slice, don't ruin all the other slices just because you want to eat toppings only.", "YTA.\n\nYou know YTA. You offered to buy another pizza and he turned you down because what you did was rude and selfish.\n\nPut yourself in his shoes, you get your favorite order from your favorite restaurant. Your (hopefully ex) boyfriend digs through it to pick out his favorite pieces and leaves you the picked over meal.\n\nWhen you confront him about it, he laughs at you because it's no big deal to him. How would you feel?", "NTA. Who cares. Buy another. Do you both live under a bridge?", "Calling you TA is a bit too hars. Both is true. Unnecessary thing to do but to overreact like this is childish. He should just say that he doesn\u2019t like it when you do X and be understanding that you may be used to do X and now you have to accept that your not alone anymore. And if you do X again then you have to be doing it to piss him off. But to overreact the first time someone does anything is in my worldview more of a red flag than somebody eating the topping only", "ESH. You're the Ah for eating the topping and making the rest of the pizza a waste. He's the AH for how he flipped out and if he never communicated he wanted to keep the pizza.\n\nSide note: If he flips out over pizza after dating for one month, get the fuck out.", "ESH.\n\nIn defense of your BF, I wouldn\u2019t want to eat a pizza that someone else poked their fingers into. Eating another slice would have been a better choice. \n\nBut you ruined his day? That\u2019s just silly, especially since you offered to buy a fresh pizza.", "YTA. That\u2019s like eating all the frosting off of a cupcake and being like \u201cbut you still have the cake.\u201d", "So when there's leftover cake, and your still hungry, do you scrape the icing off or do you cut another piece of cake. YTA", "Unpopular opinions but def NTA, if the pizza was up for grabs you can eat it however you want, even if it\u2019s weird. \n\nPlus you offered to buy him a whole other one.", "OOF, break up : (", "I'll go against the grain and say nta but I also pick toppings off when I get full. You offered to buy another one he refused let it be whatever", "Asshole or no, why tf is everyone here acting like cheese pizza is going to give you food poisoning? It\u2019s still fucking pizza, man. There are some people, myself included, who PREFER pizza that is just sauce, crust, and cheese.", "Annoying, yes but your bf\u2019s reaction is cause for concern. Everyone makes mistakes \u2026 look for a partner who will have a discussion instead of a temper tantrum/silent treatment. At the end of the day, it\u2019s just a pizza.\n\nNTA", "Ynta, he overreacted, you shouldn\u2019t have eaten the toppings but he didn\u2019t need to react the way he did", "I often wonder about long term you know what i read in relationship subs when someone does something considered a 'small' act.\n\n If you do what you yourself consider a small thing ie picking off the toppings and ruining it and your reaction to it to his reaction is at the time not much.  Okay then.\n\n\nHe's right, it's not just about the pizza, it's bigger things ahead in the relationship. You didn't ask, in a way it's disrespect.\n\nThink about a small thing the opposite way, you wanted the toppings and he shared his with you. It's  a small thing but you'd say \" aww my man loves me to do that \"\n\n You've shown him something about you he doesn't like and the stardust has fallen from his eyes a little. \n He's a right to be annoyed but 2 hours  is a lot though to be angry and to be frank, I'd be thinking hard here too.\n\nBut ESH in your act and reaction and his long over reaction.", "ESH, don\u2019t desecrate a pizza like that and your bf shouldn\u2019t overreact to something as simple as food. He can still eat it, just with no toppings. If something as little as eating toppings on a pizza will ruin his day then maybe reevaluate your relationship.", "INFO: did you eat the cheese off, too? \u2018Cause I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal if you just ate the pineapple and meat. I\u2019d hardly say the remaining cheese pizza is ruined or inedible.", "a little weird but NTA. if you hadn\u2019t offered to buy more pizza for him it would be different, but he\u2019s pouting over nothing at this point.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it's also so wasteful because she didn't even eat the pizza, just the toppings like some picky entitled spoiled toddler. \n\nIt's like if there was half a cake left over and someone proceeded to lick off the frosting and leave the now-ruined rest. It's so so wasteful and selfish, it's infuriating. But also just unhinged.\n\nYTA OP", "He definitely should break up with her. It's only been a month, and this kind of action says a lot about who she is and how she'll treat him going forward. She's inconsiderate, dismissive, and wasteful.", "Ma\u2019am\n\nWhat the fuck", "Well....that would annoy me too ...soooo", "I mean that definitely does make you an asshole. Gross", "They are toppings but BF is right - it is not about the pizza but the total lack of consideration. It was a shared pizza, they finished only a half. What OP should've done if she was still hungry, was having a slice or two, not eating all the toppings off the entire leftover pizza. What if he got hungry later in the evening, like she did?  \n\n\nWhat I agree with you, though, is that ESH. While she thought only about herself and was egoistic AF, if he wanted the pizza for lunch, he should've said so. \"Hey, GF, I want to keep the rest for my lunch tomorrow, do you mind?\" and \"Hey BF, I am still hungry so I am going to eat 2 slices and the other 2 are for you\" are sentences that are not so hard to be said.", "Nope. It\u2019s either hungry or not hungry - there\u2019s not ever the need to only pick the toppings off.", "OP probably takes the cream out of Oreos and leaves you with the biscuit.", ">because you grew up in a weird family with weird manners, or just because you're young and immature\n\nYou could say the same for the BF. \"oh his anger was due to a weird family with weird manners, or because he's young and immature\".\n\nWeird how you side with the gf and not the BF though", "My dad let me so this and I did not grow into an adult like this.\n\nBecause normal adults can recognize the difference between \"things your parents let you get away with because you're cute and they love you\" vs \"acceptable behavior with other people\".", "Yeah this is what got me.  I was still hungry so instead of just *eating another piece* I scavenged the toppings????", "Yes. I wanted to ask how old OP is, because they act like a 5 year old.  YTA", "My ex husband gave me a cake for Mother\u2019s Day but four slices were missing. He wanted to half my cake and eat it too.", "Came here for this", "That scene lives rent free in my mind \ud83d\ude02", "Lmao legit came to say this", "Totally reminded me of this too", "Was thinking the exact same thing.", "It\u2019s about power and control.", "My husband does this. I find it super weird and question his sanity, but he does it with his own pizza, so whatever.", "Taking a bite and *putting it back* is fucking unhinged behavior.", "No, that\u2019s also gross.", "Then his rant shouldn\u2019t have been about how he was looking forward to the leftover pizza. It sounds like they\u2019re newly in a couple. This is when they\u2019re still figuring things out. A \u201chey that\u2019s not cool\u201d and explaining why is going to be better for both of them in the end, instead of going off on her for several hours. Maybe she does this at her house and still eats the leftovers afterward just without the toppings - assuming she left the cheese. Sometimes couples develop quirks where one person eats one part of a food and the other person eats the other part. I\u2019m just saying he handled it poorly. Even the larger point doesn\u2019t warrant his lashing out.", "I wondered if maybe she was wanted the pleasure of tasting it while not having to metabolise the carbs.\n\nDoesn\u2019t change how much of an AH move it is. Shows such a lack of consideration and self control.", "100% eats the skin off of the entire rotisserie chicken", "Can you imagine being as entitled as you?", "I\u2019m imagining her boyfriend in the living room watching TV while she excused herself to stand in the darkened kitchen, the only illumination from the open refrigerator door as she hunches over, picking pineapple, pepperoni, and cheese out of the half opened box and stuffing it in her face before he notices.", "You made as AH of yourself with your reaction. If you ate one slice with topping, that ok, but you didn't.", "Eh it\u2019s not that uncommon my late teens niece would order pizzas eat the topping and throw the base away untouched", "My wife will do this and I question her sanity until i remember she married me and it all makes sense.\n\nHopelessly insane", "But like, you're coming back to eat it later so why does a bite out of it matter? Sometimes I'm hungry, have a bite and it's just not sitting right. I know I'll come back and finish it later, I just can't at that very moment.", "And that's exactly why ESH. His behavior was a bit over the top but she also acted like the shared pizza was hers only. Key word, shared. What she is doing at her house with her own things is irrelevant, unless she is 5.", "Yeah, my 3 y.o. does that. Pretends to be hungry, then proceeds to only eat the topping and not the slice of bread. Adults really should be long past that.", "Disrespects??? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Like I knew most of reddit was outcasts living in moms basement but god damn, try going out in the real world. Explore other countries and cultures. Hahahaha thanks for the laugh", "\u201cI ordered us a pizza\u201d is different than \u201cI ordered a pizza with him\u201d. \n\nNeither actually establish who paid for the pizza though.", "Either way it was always a shared pizza and she single-handedly decided to ruin the rest of the pizza", "No, if she'd said \"I ordered a Hawaiian pizza to share with my bf\" that would imply that she paid for it alone. \n\nShe said \"I ordered a Hawaiian pizza *with* my bf\" implying they ordered it together with how she worded it. \n\nHer offering to buy another pizza has nothing to do with who initially paid since her offer was meant to make up for what she ate (or didn't eat) & could be done regarding who paid depending on how OP felt (if she was the only one who paid).", "Some places do a pizza bowl. But that doesn\u2019t make this situation less wasteful. Your niece at least isn\u2019t rude like OP, since she bought it for herself. So she\u2019s only wasting her own. \nI think ultimately it\u2019s the selfishness and lack of consideration that is bothersome about the OP\u2019s behavior.", "She should had ask.", "So, say it was a normal 8 slice pizza. Both ate 2 slices (4 total) leaving 4 to be split later. Where OP becomes an AH is by eating the toppings from all 4 slices left for both to eat later without asking if her bf wanted his 2 beforehand. It's reasonable to assume when you order a pizza to split that you will get half unless there's a different agreement regarding splitting. Since there wasn't another agreement here, OP was 100% wrong & rude to touch his half (2 slices) without his permission. \n\nYTA OP. Next time ask before you touch someone else's food. Apologize & buy him another pizza. You already offered & you should follow through after being so rude as to eat the toppings from the slices that weren't yours to touch.", "Awful lot of words to make anything the woman does fine while villifying the man. Notice how you've changed your tune here to there not being enough info? Yet you determined she wasn't TA despite there not being enough information apparently?"]}
