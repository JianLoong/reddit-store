I suffer with PCOS and Endometriosis, my husband and I have been trying for years with no success. This is where I may be TA. I told my husband if this was going to be her only chance to have a grandchild, then any child I have won\u2019t be her grandchild. She knows about my fertility issues and has come to doctors appointments with me.

My husband has three other siblings. When she made the comment she tagged both my husband and I in the comment. She doesn\u2019t have contact with the birth mother and only gets info from my husband. This is not the first time she has done something like this. My husband and I dated for a short while in HS and she says that I broke his heart. She has told my husband that he needs to stop being my little b*tch and doing everything I say because we decided to move away from her.

Your husband has your back here, that is a ding dang good metric for whether you're out of pocket or not. Your MIL sounds like a piece of work.", "NTA - you have every right to be angry. Your mother in law should not have discussed your personal health information. BUT address that with her like an adult. \n\nNo doubt she messed up but dont get on her level.", "NTA. What gives her the right to go around making passive aggressive comments about your fertility issues? Why would she even reply to a congratulatory comment by saying the child may be her *only* grandchild? I\u2019d be pissed, too.", "ESH Honestly. Yeah MIL is more of one of course. Cause you don't blast stuff like that on facebook. I don't know what the friends comment was the need a dumb response like \"it might be her only chance at a grandchild.\" which could blast private info on the web. Which to be fair it might. Not technically wrong but big A move from MIL\n\nYou and hubby cause tell me. I you guys do end up conceiving and the grandchild gets a sibling. How are you gonna even go at it with why does sibiling have a good relationship with grandma and not your child.\n\nI mean i dont know the full story since there seems to be big crap between you and MIL. Just if you do keep MIL from your future child. Just don't complain your child doesn't get anything from his grandma that first grandchild gets cause they can get a relationship and your child can't. Cause MIL will owe you and your child nothing if she can't have a relationship with em.", "NTA but MiL is for sure one", "Wait OP, why would you want someone like this, with troublesome behavior you recognized early one, to go with you to your fertility appts?", "NTA \n\nYour MIL was super rude and insensitive to post anything implying that you may never have a child. \n\nYou would be right to keep that kid from her. \n\nShe has no empathy towards you at all but only your ability to give her a grandkid.", "I don\u2019t understand the YTA comments. Did y\u2019all have a bad day at work, your spouses cheat on you, ancestry DNA revealed that the kids you raised aren\u2019t yours? The MIL is a clueless idiot for her comment on FB, OP is understandably angry and what she said in the moment makes sense. Maybe all the YTA commenters are FB friends with MIL.", "I'm gonna say NTA simply because you haven't actually done anything yet. You mentioned it to your husband alone (if I'm reading correctly) and honestly you're just mad. \n\nYou should confront her about the comment and how it made you feel, minus the threat of disowning a grandchild. If you do have a kid, I'd imagine your feelings would have toned down a bit so anything you happened to have said to your husband isn't really relevant.\n\nNow if you said it to her directly, you'd be the AH too.", "YTA she didn't bring up Ur fertility she didn't say well op can't have kids so this will b my only grandkids like u said she has 4 kids total her possibly my only grandchild comment was a passive aggressive dig about her other kids not having kids.....honestly Ur post and responses to comments just comes across like U don't like her and are determined to find fault with her", "*she replied that it may be her only chance to have a grandchild*\n\nYour MIL posted this on facebook? Putting up your fertility issues publicly is very poor. Endometriosis can be a terrible problem. My sympathies OP.", "ESH. What your MIL did was horrible and she should not have made that comment in private much less for the entire world to see and now assume you as a couple might not be able to conceive. That being said it's extreme to say any of your children won't be her grandchildren. I'd suggest talking to her about it and making sure she understands the pain she caused and apologizes to you and takes the comment down. If she doesn't see anything wrong with her comment and attitude then you wouldn't be the AH for cutting her off your life.", "YTA, I completely get why your upset, but saying she won't get to be a grandmother to any future children you and your husband have is not how to handle this.\n\nYou mention there have been past issues, so I'm assuming communication has already been tried, if not that be the first step.\n\nYou'd be using a kid, or kids against her and creating a family dynamic where one kid in your family has a grandmother the others don't.  It just seems like the situation that would create endless drama.\n\nI'd try to fix things, and give her enough rope to either justify cutting off ALL your husbands kids from her, or none.\n\n\\*Edit\\* and if that decision is made it should be because its best for the kids not for getting back at her.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\n**You said in a comment your MIL has 4 children total.** So her comment, although rude and not something I think should be put on social media, wasn't directed solely at you personally. Throttle down with the outrage.", "I have been wanting to be a mother since I turned 18.

OP is *choosing* to interpret the comment as being all about her.", "But they might? No one knows. I don\u2019t know why that offends you so deeply.", "\u2026 then what is your entire post about? \n\nIs this just some revenge fantasy against your MIL?", "MIL *knows* OP wants to and is trying to have children, plus she\u2019s aware of OP\u2019s medical history, so a comment like that is pretty messed up.", "I love that child also. I\u2019m not upset that she posted it. I\u2019m upset she brought my fertility issues into it.", "MIL also knows she has 3 other children who are presumably adults or close to adults. Saying that 1 grandbaby might be her only implies that she thinks none of her adult children, are going to give her any more grandbabies.", "Did she specifically mention fertility issues or just that it may be her only grandchild? Because that alone doesn\u2019t tell people anything about your fertility", "She mentioned my fertility and tagged my husband and I in the comment", "See, now you\u2019re not coming across as believable. If she mentioned your fertility and tagged your husband in the Facebook comment, why would you not put that in your original write-up??? That\u2019s literally the most important and offensive aspect of what you\u2019re claiming she did. \n\nIt just doesn\u2019t come across as believable when you didn\u2019t bother to mention this in your original write-up, and only divulged it *after* multiple people started criticizing you. You also failed to mention in your write-up that your MIL has three other children, who could possibly give her grandkids.\n\nYour story isn\u2019t adding up.", "Yeah that\u2019s an AH move on her part if she specifically mentioned your fertility, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough of a reason in itself to cut her out of any future children\u2019s lives, but it definitely does warrant her being called out and boundaries being set on sharing any of your personal medical info.", "Again I\u2019m on mobile and only trying to get the basics. If you have a question feel free to ask. I didn\u2019t find it important", "MIL does not sounds like the best person here but OP does\u2026 not appear to be helping this situation."]}
