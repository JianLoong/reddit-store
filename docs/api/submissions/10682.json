This is not the first time she has done something like this. My husband and I dated for a short while in HS and she says that I broke his heart.

What gives her the right to go around making passive aggressive comments about your fertility issues? Why would she even reply to a congratulatory comment by saying the child may be her *only* grandchild? I\u2019d be pissed, too.", "ESH Honestly. Yeah MIL is more of one of course. Cause you don't blast stuff like that on facebook. I don't know what the friends comment was the need a dumb response like \"it might be her only chance at a grandchild.\" which could blast private info on the web. Which to be fair it might. Not technically wrong but big A move from MIL\n\nYou and hubby cause tell me. I you guys do end up conceiving and the grandchild gets a sibling. How are you gonna even go at it with why does sibiling have a good relationship with grandma and not your child.\n\nI mean i dont know the full story since there seems to be big crap between you and MIL. Just if you do keep MIL from your future child. Just don't complain your child doesn't get anything from his grandma that first grandchild gets cause they can get a relationship and your child can't.

You mentioned it to your husband alone (if I'm reading correctly) and honestly you're just mad. \n\nYou should confront her about the comment and how it made you feel, minus the threat of disowning a grandchild.

What your MIL did was horrible and she should not have made that comment in private much less for the entire world to see and now assume you as a couple might not be able to conceive. That being said it's extreme to say any of your children won't be her grandchildren. I'd suggest talking to her about it and making sure she understands the pain she caused and apologizes to you and takes the comment down.

It just seems like the situation that would create endless drama.\n\nI'd try to fix things, and give her enough rope to either justify cutting off ALL your husbands kids from her, or none.\n\n\\*Edit\\* and if that decision is made it should be because its best for the kids not for getting back at her.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\n**You said in a comment your MIL has 4 children total.** So her comment, although rude and not something I think should be put on social media, wasn't directed solely at you personally.

She can earn that by having a strong and positive relationship with both parents of said children.

I don't think you're trying to be harmful, but telling a person in the midst of the fertility battle that they shouldn't care about experiencing pregnancy and birth is hurtful.

I'm happy that the gynecologist had studied PCOS and was able to give me advise and such(most important thing was telling me that I needed to have some kind of birth control or medication to make sure that the ovulation would be removed since no periods or rarely having periods increases the risk for uterus cancer) but most things about it I've found online.\nI am a part of a study atm to see if there's a connection between diabetes type 1 and PCOS btw, its been a lot of blood work and I've spent much time with it but I hope it leads to something even if they don't find a connection!", "The authors documented their struggles with fertility and looking at food to balance hormones on social media, where they gained a pretty large following.
