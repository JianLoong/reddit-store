Speak to people as if you\u2019re giving them the benefit of the doubt (ie as if you have higher expectations for their good intentions than you actually do), and be calm and rational. This will not *always* result in someone being less rude to you, but sometimes it does, and if it doesn\u2019t, then it still does a better job of highlighting their overreaction.

A lot of times, kids have never been modelled appropriate conflict resolution, and it throws them off. \n\nIn the other hand, OP\u2019s comment about bite marks very well might have, with another kid, been more likely to escalate even further.

What a long-sinded way of saying women are responsible for managing others'\n\nI EMPHATICALLY reject women being held responsible for managing others\u2019 behaviour. I would have given *identical* advice to a man. In fact, I give this exact advice to men *more often,* because men tend to have less tools for conflict deescalation than women do, because society does not expect it of men.

But not with the second one. \n\n> By the time the brother came over, knowing that the noodle was OP's property \n\nHow would you know what the kid actually told his brother? That was literally my point. \n\n> and OP had already said no, \n\nAnd yet\u2026 here comes brother to further escalate the situation. \u201cNo\u201d wasn\u2019t effective, so I offered how I would have tried to deescalate the situation (with significant experience). \n\nLet\u2019s also not pretend OP simply repeated \u201cno\u201d to the brother. OP was the one who raised the tone to condescension (justified or no). \n\n> how could OP have been \"more mature\" than to reiterate that position with clear reasons? \n\n\u2026 I literally said explicitly word for word how to do this. And in my example, they ALSO reiterated that position with clear reasons. It\u2019s their property. \n\nThe difference is the tone in my example is (in my experience) less likely to result in further confrontation. Not guaranteed, but less likely. \n\nI still said they were NTA. \n\n> Why do you think that OP should have spent more energy on this encounter when she was just minding her own business trying to relax?\n\nWhat I recommended they say instead would NOT have required more energy. It\u2019s not a monologue, it\u2019s a few sentences. Arguably OP used more energy getting upset over it. \n\n> The brother who approached OP the second time was in the wrong, full stop, for not telling his brother, \"Hey she already told you no,\" but instead proceeding to bother OP and then call her a bitch for stating facts. \n\nAgain. \n\nFirst, we have no idea what the kid told their brother. Which was my point. \n\nSecond, they called OP a bitch AFTER OP\u2019s heated reply.. which is exactly the type of escalation my recommended course would have been trying to avoid. \n\n> OP is NTA, \n\nI literally said this. You accused me of not reading it.. but did you read mine? \n\n> and deserves better than to be called names for existing by the pool with her personal property.\n\nI agree. Emphatically. My comment did not suggest otherwise, and was intended to offer OP a way to try and avoid this happening.", "Wow. What a way to reduce a situation regarding kids and immaturity to women vs men. Just because the participants are respectively male and female, does not mean that\u2019s the center of the issue. You just want to be a victim.", "They don\u2019t. \n\nThe sexist comment came AFTER OP replied. If it was a dude, he probably would have gotten called a dick. Though, granted, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been approached in the first place. \n\nI was not even remotely thinking about OP\u2019s gender when I replied. In fact, I skimmed the genders (usually do) and had OP in my brain as a guy because of the \u201cbro\u201d thing (which is biased in itself, I know, but also *still* not what I based my comment on)\n\nI\u2019m also a woman, by the way.\n\nThough\u2026 if you want to seriously bring gender into this\u2026 the way I recommended OP respond is also the *safer* way, when you\u2019re being aggressively approached.  \n\n**This was never about gender for me, it was about deescalation. I would have given identical advice if OP was male.**\n\nI said OP was NTA. I don\u2019t have a problem with what they said. I just said what I would have done. I don\u2019t expect everyone else would agree, or do the same.\n\nEdit: to respond to your reply which you have since deleted:\n\n> The insult (\"b*tch\") was gendered.  \n\nYes. It also occurred AFTER OP replied. So OP\u2019s response wasn\u2019t based on an interpretation that someone was being sexist to them. \n\n> Being called a dick is barely an insult, \n\nHow insulting they were being afterward is irrelevant to my comment, or your argument against my comment. \n\n> but I've watched guys instantly getting into fights over one calling the other a \"b*tch\".\n\nAgain\u2026 this is utterly irrelevant because that came after OP\u2019s comment. So my alternate reply can\u2019t be interpreted as \u201cplacating sexists.\u201d \n\n> YOUR gender doesn't matter in this case. \n\nBut I stated it for the record, to communicate that I understand what it is to deal with sexism. \n\n> Women uphold the patriarchy almost as much as men do, \n\nI would EMPHATICALLY argue against \u201calmost as much.\u201d But they certainly do, yes. \n\n> and you're just finding more reasons the OP to placate an aggressive man. \n\nIt is not a way to placate. It\u2019s a way to deescalate. \n\nIf you want to try and act like I wouldn\u2019t give the same advice to a man (which I would), whatever. You do you. \n\n> Kinda gross.\n\nYou\u2019re entitled to your opinion. I disagree.", "I would add that \"sharing\" can be most often used for consumables (eg, \"can you two kids share this bowl of popcorn\" etc) as well as for community property. I don't mind asking/being asked to share personal property, and I feel the same way about my kids. But in order for it to truly be based in goodwill, the person needs to legitimately be able to say no.", "Yep, back when my kids were little and we belonged to the neighborhood lake association, we ran into similar situations. There was a shed with association toys that anyone was welcome to use, but my kids would often bring their own things to the lake that they liked. If they wanted to share them, great. If not, I never forced the issue. 99% of the time people understood. The other 1%, I'd direct the kid (and parent) to the shed and say, \"There are plenty of toys in there for little Johnny to use. The toy my son is using belongs to him.\"", "Yeah, I don't think \"can I borrow your pool noodle\" falls into the same category.\n\nIt really is okay to ask. \nAs long as you have room for no.\n\nOP was fine with the ask.
