We get along great, and have virtually no issues. I say virtually because we do have this *one* issue, and honestly I don\u2019t consider myself wise enough to trust my own self reflection on the matter. \n\nBefore I met my partner, she was pretty much carried through life by her parents. School payed for, rent covered, car payed for, etc. Once we started dating, her parents would use this financial help to \u201ccontrol\u201d her in ways. For example, she would be given ultimatums like \u201cyou cant do (this) or we will take (this thing we are paying for) away\u201d, and often they would be used to keep her from around me. I eventually told her that if she wanted this to stop, she would have to learn to provide for herself, and she did exactly that. She had a nice job and just needed to take the initiative to pay her own bills, and of course she had me to help her a little. After a few months of her taking care of herself, she\u2019s at my apartment and we get a call from her dad FLIPPING out because her bank was overdrafted. (He apparently still had access from when he was giving her money). He told her she had 20 mins to \u201cget home\u201d. She was obviously very upset and really didn\u2019t want to go there just to get in trouble with her dad. My partner was 21 at the time, and living in her own apartment and was no longer being provided for by her parents, so I told her \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to go get yelled at, you simply don\u2019t have to\u201d and so she told her dad she wasn\u2019t going to see him when he\u2019s screaming at her. I was very proud of her for calmly setting boundaries with her dad, but that all went away when he somehow found my address and showed up there. He proceeded to scream at my partner in the middle of the street and talk about how much he hates and wants to harm me. My partner eventually came inside and was in the middle of a terrible panic attack like I\u2019ve never seen. I felt horrible and there was nothing I could do. It was awful. \nFast forward a couple more months and I\u2019m changing the brake pads on her car, and find a very expensive tracker hidden on the car. This felt like an INSANE breach of not just my partners privacy, but also my own! Up to this point, I had traveled with her to do so many things, visit my family or our friends, been dropped off at my job, etc. and now this guy who said he wants to hurt me knows where all of this stuff is! \n\nAfter this I have refused to go around him. If there is an event he will be attending, my partner will go alone. If she goes to their house, it is without me. My partner is very okay with this and fully understands, but both her parents think I\u2019m being ridiculous and over reacting. Honestly, the idea of being around him makes me very uncomfortable and anxious and I don\u2019t feel like I have to subject my self to that.\n\nEdit: Took all of your advice, she has a new bank and shes seriously considering filing a police report. Thats hard for her, obviously, so i\u2019m letting her take her time. I just needed reassurance I was doing the right thing.

This sounds like a horribly toxic relationship. The bit about the tracker just simply isn't okay. While it is not your place to do so yourself, I would encourage your girlfriend to make a police report.", "NTA, but I urge you to consider the effect this will have on your life long term. If your partner is letting crazy stuff like this slide and maintaining contact with them, it\u2019s always going to be a part of your life. Do not expect them to change if there\u2019s no reason for them to change.", "NTA. Of course her parents think your boundaries are ridiculous, they've never met a boundary they could appreciate. You don't owe them an explanation, keep on doing what you're doing.", "You need to contact the police. ASAP. Your partner needs to understand that she cannot keep her parents, ESPECIALLY her dad when he STALKED YOU and threatened to HARM YOU.", "NTA\n\nI would start keeping records of any interactions you have with this man. They should include dates, times, and places. Also include screen shots of any texts, recordings of any voice mail messages, names of witnesses, etc.\n\nIn addition, encourage your gf to set hard boundaries for her parents. Her dad is a controlling AH and might be a bit unhinged.", "NTA. I would never be around that guy ever. He doesn't seem to know that he's overstepping by tracking a car and her bank account. GF needs to get him off her accounts and let him know that the police will get called if any of this happens again.", "NTA. First off, if you don\u2019t want to be around your partner\u2019s dad, even if he hadn\u2019t done that, that is your choice and you aren\u2019t an AH for it. Secondly, what he did was a gross breach of privacy and is highly illegal. She should file a police report.", "NTA.  It is reasonable to not want to be around your partner's dad.  If anyone ever threatened me, I would stay far, far away.  Also, he has demonstrated (via the tracker) that he feels entitled to run his daughter's life, and therefore parts of your life.\n\nIt is not like anyone has apologized to you or your GF for their horrible behavior.  Or have they?  If they did you could reconsider the no-communication restriction.\n\nIf you and your GF are okay with this, then everything is fine - it is no one else's business.", "NTA and I hope you took a hammer to the tracker and mailed the broken pieces back to daddy.", "NTA he is a stalker creep.", "NTA \n\nThe tracker sounds very scary. What would you have suggested to your girlfriend if it was a stalker/ex who installed a tracker? Maybe apply the same advice (I am hoping that it would be filing a police report - because it would start a paper trail) And maybe start recording the dates and times that he bothers you - regardless of how big or small - so that if the situation escalates, and you need a restraining order, you have a paper trail. \n\nWith regards to the bank account - maybe she needs a new account with a new bank - and maybe set up some sort of security to prevent outsider access to the banking info.  (if she stays at her current bank, even if she changes who can access her account, it is possible that the dad would weasel his way into getting banking info since he was part of the account at some point?)", "The guy who put a tracking device in his daughters car thinks OP is over reacting.

Eventually she\u2019ll cut ties with him too. That\u2019s way over the line. I have a grown son who lives with me and I can\u2019t imagine doing that to him. He will try to alienate her from you. He wants control of her forever.", "NTA", "NTA OMG. Her dad is abusive and dangerous to the both of you. You do NOT have to subject yourself to that and her dad should not have access to her financials any longer. This dude may require a restraining order. What a creep.", "NTA. IF he comes to your place like that again I'd suggest to call the police and have them deal with it to begin a paper trail.  If you still have the tracker, I'd also say you may want to give that to the police saying it was on your girlfriend's car and mention how you're afraid you guys may be dealing with a stalker.", "They think you're overreacting about being freaked out when he threatened to harm you and is tracking you illegally??! They sound like they're certifiably insane or supervillains. NTA", "NTA - I think you could file that police report, right? It sounds like your girlfriend is doing a lot of emotional, financial, and now legal work that is important but might be heading a one-way direction to you being the only person she relies on, which is problematic in its own right. Her parents deserve to be kept in check, but if she files the report, she will have to begin dealing with statements and testimony against people that did provide for her throughout her whole life, however controlling it may have been. It adds a new layer of stress in an already stressful ordeal. If you take on the responsibility of the police report, it might help lessen that stress for her.", "NTA\n\nThis is insane.  Check her old account and make sure he didn't pull money out to make her overdraft.  It sounds too coincidental with the rest of this information.", "Done, she isn\u2019t ready to up and do it yet but I have no doubt she will in time. Shes as tired of this as I am", "She isn\u2019t letting stuff slide, I don\u2019t think\u2026 Shes told both her parents how unacceptable their actions are but they dont seem to care, which has led her relationship with them to be pretty rocky and them to think im a \u201cdrama queen\u201d lol", "This. These people are not the ones to go to for advice on boundaries\u2014they put a tracker on the car!

She isn\u2019t trying to cut them out completely, and I get how thats hard, but she is certainly cold towards them and obviously they dont interact with me anymore", "Please consider the long term consequences of dating someone who does not and seems to not be developing the skills to set boundaries like an adult and seemingly won\u2019t separate herself from her abusive family dynamic. Do you really want to be with someone who needed her BF to convince her to adult? Why didn\u2019t she want independence for herself? As someone whose been in your shoes (young, in love with someone with an abusive controlling family) you will get tired of doing all the work of parenting your partner eventually and resent that she is being held up by yourself and not her own merit. She needs to be the one to call the cops, set boundaries with her family, take her family off her accounts and stop being so emotionally enmeshed with her family. You can support her but it\u2019s hard line to hold and not just do it for her or baby her about it. It\u2019s very hard for people like your GF to truly separate from their abusive family system and you have to consider how long you will reasonably stick around on the promise that it will be better \u201csomeday\u201d. The older you get the less BS you are willing to deal with so keep that in mind as well. You have a lot of bandwidth for this bad behaviour right now but that will wane fast as you grow through your 20s.", "There are no consequences for their actions beyond being scolded, so I definitely think she\u2019s letting it slide.", "I hear you, I just love her so much and she is making a lot of progress. Im not willing to end my relationship over this, but Im also not stupid and I wont subject myself to misery if I don\u2019t have to. Again tho, you\u2019re right, through and through. Im just not ready to make that decision yet"]}
