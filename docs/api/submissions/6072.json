She was really upset and said she's better than me, more qualified than me, so on, and her family was telling her she didn't get the position because she didn't try hard enough and to ask me for tips. I left her alone at the time, I thought it got better after a bit but there's still some resentment.\n\nSo at the start of December we had a family potluck. My internship finished and I recently got a permanent position with the company. A lot of people were congratulating me, I wasn't making a big deal out of it or anything and just said thanks. I heard Ashley got a spot at another company not long ago, so I went up to congratulate her and said I was happy she eventually got a job.\n\nAshley was kind of sarcastic (and snappy?), she said something like oh thank you so much, only the great nepo product congratulating me. \n\nI was really annoyed and replied I was literally trying to be nice and she needs to control her jealousy.\n\nAshley got mad and it's created tension between us, even at Christmas a few days ago and we just ignored each other.

The pool was small and they only had so many positions.

Seriously you don\u2019t doubt that do you? It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not qualified but it doesn\u2019t mean there wasn\u2019t some preference due to o your relationship.

You're both right.\n\nYour job will now always be seen as a product of nepotism since it probably was, two candidates being equal like you and your cousin, the girlfriend would obviously be chosen. It would be more tasteful to acknowledge or ignore this fact than contradict it. If they say your *career* not just the job is a product of nepotism, then contest it.\n\nShe is jealous that you got the job she wanted and what doubly sucks is your/her family treated her like crap for it by saying she didn't try hard enough for it which wouldn't be true if she made it to the top three. She sucks for being petty about it over the holidays but I would be a tad bitter about it too if it was a dream job situation so can't fault her too much right now about that.", "NTA, but I had thought about saying E-S-H for a few minutes. I eventually came to the NTA conclusion for a number of reasons. \n\n\n1. Saying you only got in because your boyfriend's dad owns the company is hugely insulting to you. Even if you were given a leg up because you date him, you still had the ability to be credited with scholarships and to graduate college. They don't just award scholarships to anyone and college takes work. Obviously you can handle the work. \n\n\n2. Women can get in high stakes jobs without being helped along by significant others and their families. Relegating it to your boyfriend being the only reason you got a job is incredibly sexist. And just because Ashley is also a woman doesn't mean that isn't sexist, women can be sexist against women just like men can be sexist against men. \n\n\n3. You weren't rubbing it in her face and gloating. You congratulated her and she chose to get snappy and sarcastic about it. You also mentioned in a comment to another person that she had gotten hired at a company that you had been rejected for so there is no reason for her to be dragging this out. \n\n\nThe only reason I had to think you were sort of an asshole was the eventually getting a job part. Job market is hard especially if you are just out of college. My professors always said that connections can help you out of college. You had that connection and she didn't, but that's no reason to act like you have no knowledge or ability.", ">My boyfriend's dad's company was offering a paid internship. 3 people got on the final shortlist and I was eventually selected\n\nSo even if you went through the selection process, there was still a bias.

And she does have a job now so what's the issue? Is she jealous people were congratulating you and not her?\n\nI think you went a bit overboard at a family event and might've been better to leave it, but I understand you're tired of her acting better-than-thou. \n\nI actually had a friend similar to this, we were both applying for the same intern position, I got it but she didn't because she didn't have all the qualifications and her college results were significantly lower. She ended the friendship after that. It might be a similar situation with Ashley, but I'm just struggling to see where her entitlement is coming from? I totally get being upset at the time, but surely she sees by now it was a competitive position and she lost.

Businesses are taking a chance on interns, whether there's a nepo relationship or not. And it wasn't her dad..it's a bfs dad, which isn't clear whether he has position to sway their decision. The niece was jealous and commented unnecessarily..I'd stand up for myself too. Even in a blatantly nepo situation, which I don't think this is, she passed the rigors of the business and earned her full-time spot after probation. What, are people supposed to NOT take advantage of a career-starting opportunity? Networking in business is a fucking real thing, and some people have that skillset while some don't.

Can you prove that the OP didn't do better at the interview, have a better resume, or any number of other possibilities?

Looks like she didn't need your help.", "So bug tech actually rated her better than you? And you still are in denial that sleeping with the bosses son got you your job?", "Nothing about the hiring process is really fair. They are looking at you on paper. And then talking to you for 30 minutes. And then making a value decision on both your skill and your ability to fit into the culture. White men often have an advantage. Sometimes a company gets on a diversity kick and a woman or POC has an advantage. Fit and/or pretty people nearly always have an advantage. Once, a hiring manager had just dropped his kid off at my shitty college, and in a burst of fatherly pride, he forgot that I didn\u2019t go to a place with a ranking of any sort and gave me the position. Usually, it\u2019s the other way around. \n\nA personal rec from a current employee (doesn\u2019t necessarily say he is the owner/CEO) *can* help. But the referrer generally has to be willing to stick their neck out and vouch for you, and he could have easily nixed her if he thought she\u2019d do poorly. I\u2019ve had to do that a time or two when I didn\u2019t want my coworkers to hate me for recommending a really nice, but ultimately worthless new hire. \u201cKnowing a guy\u201d is not a free pass. \n\nWhich is what cousin is implying. \u201cNepo Product\u201d reduces OP to *just* her relationship. And that\u2019s insulting. She could also be smart and capable, plus have the tie breaker vote. It\u2019s really not that different than claiming a woman slept to the top, which is gross and demeaning and false 99% of the time. I can understand why OP pushes back on the label because the label overstates her advantage and dismissed her scholarship and her work ethic and her knowledge. It\u2019s unfair for cousin to say, and it\u2019s borne of jealousy and bitterness, and it\u2019s just a fact of life because everyone has little gifts and advantages and strengths that others don\u2019t. It\u2019s a crap shoot for when yours comes in to play.", "Where did she deny anything? Doesn\u2019t say that at all. Just that she had to go through the same selection process and that she had the qualifications as well. She acknowledge she had connections.", "Tech is very fickle and luck based. Someone could get a job at Facebook and be rejected by hundreds of \u201clesser\u201d companies. Just because she got rejected by a big tech company doesn\u2019t mean OP is a \u201cworse\u201d engineer than her niece. There\u2019s no telling who has the better resume from the info OP has given.
