She and I aren't particularly close but I don't dislike her and I suspect she asked me just because i'm my brothers sister. I of course agreed and I was even fine with her putting me in whatever style she wanted so long as it didn't involve me cutting/dyeing my hair you know any major changes. It's not my day I can suck up an ugly dress and act like it's gorgeous if that makes her happy. \n\nThe issue however is that i'm a wheelchair user. I know that the wedding venue is fine for me as it's our local church, totally accessible so all good. It's the venue being used for the reception that worries me. I asked her where the reception was going to be and if it was accessible for me and had an accessible bathroom, you know just covering my bases. She didn't get back to me. I figured she was busy so left it a week or so before chasing her up again to reask. She told me she wasn't sure so I asked where it was and she told me. \n\nI ended up looking up the building and my heart sank, it is an old building, not accessible at all for me and no bathrooms I could feasibly use either. I told her this and she got very upset saying my brother had told her that he'd cover the cost and she should just pick whatever she loved and that she loved this. She then went on to suggest that we could just have someone carry me into the building and my family or the other bridesmaids could help me use the bathroom when needed which the very idea of mortified me. I'm not about to agree to being carried in and needing help to go to the bathroom. \n\nI ended up giving her two options, if she wanted me at the reception she needed to pick somewhere that was accessible. If she didn't pick somewhere accessible then i'd of course still be her bridesmaid at the wedding but i'd have to skip the reception. She got upset at this as she feels like everyone especially my family will notice my absence and question it and it'll make her look bad. She then told me I was making this about me which wasn't fair when it was her day.\n\nI won't lie at this point I was enraged, I wanted to tell my brother to let him sort this but I wasn't about to start shit between them over this and I pointed out to her that yes this was her day and I had no intention of making about me however by marrying my brother she was joining our family and she needed to realise that she was not as sensitive as she thought she was and suggesting that I be carried into the building and aided going to the bathroom was downright insulting. \n\nThis led to a larger fight and she told me if my brother didn't already know I was her bridesmaid that she'd not want me to be it anymore. I called it quits at that point and told her she had my two  options and it was up to her which she wanted.\n\nAm I the asshole here? I don't feel like asking for the minimum accessibility is a lot but maybe i'm too upset by the situation and her suggestions to see it clearly.\n\nUPDATE: Hi everyone here's an update to the situation, as many of you suggested I checked in with my Brother and told him what was going on and I found out that the reason he'd left the reception to her was they'd made an agreement with him covering the ceremony and she'd cover the reception. We're Catholic so he cared more about the religious side of the event while she cared more about the reception/party as she's not religious which isn't a bad thing just different. \n\nI showed him the texts and explained what had happened, he was pissed off at her suggestion I be carried into the building and assisted in going to the bathroom and after only a quick search of the venue she'd picked he could also see it wouldn't work out for me and promised he'd resolve this and have a talk with her. He was annoyed at me for not bringing this to his attention sooner and told me I shouldn't worry about his feelings over this. The best part of all of this? the venue isn't even booked yet, he had assumed she'd pick out somewhere accessible but has admitted that he should have ensured that and not thought it a given so he has told me he'll see it's changed and if it isn't they have a bigger problem on their hands. \n\nThe part that really got to him though was the admission that she didn't want me as her bridesmaid if he didn't already know and he told me in that case he didn't want me being her bridesmaid and instead wanted me to be his groomswoman which I agreed to. I've yet to hear back from him on what's happening, so I can only wait and see.

When my husband and I got married, it was top of mind for me to make sure both venues were wheelchair-accessible. My husband's grandmother (who raised him), was a wheelchair user, and I made sure the wedding and reception venues were accessible.

That\u2019s a hard no. Absofuckinglutely not. She owes you an apology for even suggesting that. If she has her heart set on the reception venue then she needs to accept your extremely gracious offer to skip the reception.

The fact that she basically told you she'd remove you from the bridal party if her future husband didn't already know she'd invited you tells me she might have a cruel streak he REALLY needs to know about.\n\nShe's his future wife, but you're his sister.  He almost assuredly WANTS you to share in his special day and the memories and may feel very hurt and betrayed by everybody if that doesn't happen and he didn't even know that it was happening before it was too late.

A few years ago my Dad's (relatively new at the time) girlfriend organised a hotel room for myself and my Nan, who could walk short distances on sticks but needed a wheelchair for anything more than crossing a room, but it didn't cross Dad's GF's mind to mention this to the hotel. She was SO embarrassed and apologetic when she found out that I'd had to get the room switched because the first one they gave us was up 2 flights of stairs with no elevators, and nothing like that has ever happened again.\n\nBut I can't imagine her and Dad would still be together if she'd acted like it wasn't her fault for not thinking about it, even though we were both assuring her that we understood WHY she hadn't (because it's not something she was used to routinely doing yet). Apologizing shows you know it's something you should have considered and that it's something you're likely to think about in the future, but throwing a strop like the bride here just shows that it'll happen time and time again if she thinks she can get away with it.", "I'm not loving his super hands off approach here.

It\u2019s just that we\u2019ve been trained as able-bodied people to not see how inaccessible the world is. First time I noticed, I was pushing my mum in a wheelchair to the community mailbox and back on sidewalks that for each driveway dipped down before raising for each lawn. Basically moguls. We only did it once and realized our neighbourhood was not accessible, usable, even, for my mother. If she can\u2019t get to the community mailbox without assistance, let alone with assistance, are we saying she is not part of the community? Same with the reception for a wedding.

You are entitled to be able to enter and exit  a building and you are definitely entitled to be able to use the bathroom.

Some places actually follow ADA laws and know that historic buildings ARENT grandfathered in. Many many places don't follow ADA laws and that's because it's very easy to get away with since the only enforcement of the ADA requires the disabled person to sue the business with their own money and what you do is sue them into compliance.

It's a very very common thought, one I thought before I had to start using a wheelchair. \n\nInitially, I get why the bride wouldn't have considered it, but it's the reaction she had towards it that shows she really doesn't care about OPs access needs. OP is NTA. And I'm happy to see the edit that her brother is taking this seriously.", "\u201c I asked her where the reception was going to be and if it was accessible for me and had an accessible bathroom, you know just covering my bases.

OP, and please read this carefully, can not go if the location is not accessible. this isn't negotiable, this isn't about sticking to your guns or standing up for yourself or anything, they are literally not able to go if it's not accessible. if the bride wanted her as a bridesmaid, she HAS to pick somewhere that's accessible. this is not an ask, just telling someone what is possible.", "No.  OP found out that the reception was planned for a non-accessible building.  She declined the bride's suggestion (which I'm going to be kind and call 'misguided') that she be carried and helped to the bathroom, effectively giving up her autonomy, dignity, and safety for the evening.  Instead, she offered to still be a bridesmaid, but then bow out of the reception *since it was not feasible for her to attend given the location*.  If the bride was insistent on her attendance at the reception, then a change of venue would be necessary.  OP firmly and kindly set a boundary, and is NTA for doing so.

I didn\u2019t expect anything from her in that regard but that was such a kind and thoughtful gesture for you to do for your SIL.  I do think it\u2019s different for physical disabilities vs. something food related like celiac because I can get sick so easily from cross-contamination so I generally prefer to deal with taking care of my food on my own.

You went above and beyond in my opinion which shows just how much you love your partner.", "Agreed.  On a much smaller scale, my best friend has a gluten allergy.  If my husband offers to cook us all dinner (which he has in the past), I don't remind him to make sure to pick something gluten free.  He knows.  For our wedding, I mainly dealt with the wedding/reception venue, and he and his parents did the rehearsal dinner (my FIL and MIL hosted it at their home).  I never thought twice about whether he'd remember that we'd need gluten free options (hell, my in-laws remembered, and they'd only met her a handful of times).  Just like he didn't think twice that I'd remember to make sure any steps would be small enough for his 90+ year-old grandfather to navigate. \n\nI can see why OP's brother assumed that his fianc\u00e9e would remember that wheelchair accessibility was a basic criteria.  However, as OP is seeing, people aren't always reasonable, so I'm glad she told the brother so that he could handle it.", "It's still on the brother to advocate for his family members. Benefit of the doubt is that SIL put it on her list to check and forgot. SIL is still an asshole. But I would be 10x madder at my own brother for not checking all of these things for his own family.", "Idk I kinda agree with them. This was an ultimatum about her sister in laws wedding.

She was asked to *be in the wedding*. That decision was already made. \n\nYou made a choice about your wedding, not your family members, cool...that was not the OPs point or even close to it. They are different scenarios entirely.\n\n If people *want* all family members to attend, they will be sure it's an accessible venue. If not having their disabled family members there doesn't matter to them,  then- they get to make that choice. It's clearly up to them. It is their wedding, they don't need to defend their choice. It's their money, their life.  In the OPs case, however, it is the grooms sister and its ableist and ignorant for their future sister-in-law to treat them in this way.  Being told our behaviour is harmful is the only way we are able to adjust it.", "That's just gonna either turn out y'all ganging up on her or the parents seeing yeah it's her day if this is her request she should have it for her wedding", "Yeah the anger was WILD. A reaction like your dad\u2019s gf\u2019s is WAY more like I\u2019d except - people normally react, in my experience, to disability-related mistakes with horror and deep apologies, not lashing out and anger. And the suggestion she can be carried up and helped to the loo\u2026 like no. I\u2019m a wheelchair user and can tell you that a bridesmaid being CARRIED into the venue and then going to the loo with an entourage would be way more attention grabbing than her not showing up or MOVING THE VENUE. I\u2019ve had to be carried Cleopatra\u2019s carriage style before (by some lovely drag queens at a drag bar because the lift was unexpectedly broken lol) and can confirm it\u2019s very very noticeable (also kind of terrifying and I was already drunk at the time). It\u2019s also totally humiliating to be so reliant on help and to be so noticeably othered by a simple situation for everyone else in your party - especially one that can be avoided like the case of the venue. Disabled people are just as deserving of dignity, respect and consideration as all of you walking folk - arguably we warrant more consideration and you\u2019d like to think the future SIL would have half a brain and a considerate bone in her body. Sadly it appears she does not. But the big bro seems like a good sort, barring his unfortunate taste in women. NTA", "In my opinion? Yes we sure as heck put the blame on the bride for a considerable oversight on her part, regardless of if others can also share the blame too maybe. As you said, it\u2019s not like she forgot something small here - she literally didn\u2019t even think of her future SIL and bridesmaid\u2019s accessibility needs. When you have a disabled person in your family or friend group, this is ALWAYS the first thing to consider if you\u2019re going somewhere and want them to come too. I\u2019m a wheelchair user and literally my brother\u2019s gf will diligently check Google maps before inviting me anywhere. My best friend, who hates talking to people on the phone, calls restaurants and shops up regularly to check they\u2019re ok for me. She\u2019s even \u2018scouted\u2019 places before to make sure bless her. OP isn\u2019t some stranger to the bride or even a minor guest. She\u2019s a bridesmaid and a sister of the groom. She is FAMILY. Such a huge part of her physical needs should not be just forgotten or ignored by the bride, not even mentioning the ableist BS of her reaction. We don\u2019t know who else saw the venue or if they went to look at it with her. That\u2019s information OP and therefore we do not have. All we know is the bride chose somewhere inaccessible and instead of apologising for her mistake and trying to rectify it by finding a venue her future SIL can actually get into, she doubled down and flew at OP. So yeah, I would say don\u2019t defend the bride. Maybe she made an honest mistake, maybe it was some kind of weird manipulative power play. We don\u2019t know. But we do know the bride is an AH and OP is so NTA. Don\u2019t excuse or defend ableism, whether it\u2019s conscious or unconscious, or whether there\u2019s someone else we could potentially also blame.\n\nAlso it appears that the groom, as per OP\u2019s edit, hadn\u2019t seen the venue or been shown it. He saw the accessibility issues just looking at it online. So yeah the bride should\u2019ve too.", "Fair point about the grab bars.

You and he did the right thing", "NTA, I am happy to see bro has your back on this. I hope more than anything he realizes how shameful she is acting towards his family. That is a huge red flag to me, she doesn't respect you enough to have the decency to make sure you are good.", "NTA yay brother!", "Your brother sounds sweet, though long-term I'd worry about how he has communicated your place in his life to bridezilla here.

Yes, it sounds reasonable on the surface, but it's not that straightforward without additional context. The bride proposition to have her carried is not in itself undignifying and the lack of proper bathroom could just mean her stay on the reception is shorter, so it wasn't as unreasonable and insulting as OP took it. OP's take on this idea being insulting in principle resulted in her further creating tention.\n\nBesides, OP should have brought this with her brother as step one if she's not that close with the bride. Instead OP let things escalate and involved him only after it was fairly obvious he'd take his side because she was indeed being treated poorly at that point.", "Probably should check if they have a service elevator", "I literally asked the venue to provide golf carts and other support for all levels of mobility and also ensured wheelchair access. \n\nNTA.

They were both horrified and chose another venue.", "Honestly it was a highlight of the trip haha. Everyone cheered as they carried me in and it was worth the fear of falling.

She would\u2019ve only asked once if she got a clear answer *once.* It\u2019s not unreasonable for disabled people to ask if an event they\u2019re being invited to is actually *accessible* to them.

She lacks empathy - some of that could be she needs educated about medical conditions and aids to improve life.

I have seen some pretty clueless folks who don't understand that a wheelchair does not mean they cannot be actively and independently able to care for their own needs- they treat them like kids.  Just like when talking to someone who is blind but talking loudly (I have seen this, and it amazes me - they are not deaf - they are blind Their hearing is just fine). Like turning the radio down when you are lost. . .\n\nThey never had any exposure to it, so they don't really understand it and they say or do things that are rude/offensive because they don't understand until they get educated.

I was wheelchair bound for many months last year and its crazy how many places are not accessible that able people would never realize. Im still relearning how to walk but I now make note of every place that is inaccessible or inconvenient and try and write letters to correct it. As someone who will once again be fully able to walk, we all need to look out for each other. I remember how scared I felt using a public restroom without rails when I transitioned to a cane from a walker. I felt like since I wasn't in a wheelchair anymore I no longer deserved the handicap stall. I cried because my legs weren't strong enough to get me up. I felt so stupid and didn't have anyone to help me even if I would have let them. \n\nAble bodied people don't tend to realize how difficult or dehumanizing it can be. I dont know if that is your experience but it was mine. Im glad you have a great brother (: and you're a groomswoman! I love that", "See if it was a random 2nd cousin no one is that close to, I\u2019d get my dream venue. I\u2019m disabled, there are places I can\u2019t go because of it, and I\u2019d hate for someone to miss out on their dream because of me. But people can\u2019t get mad at me that I can\u2019t attend then. They have to choose one or the other."]}
