She and I aren't particularly close but I don't dislike her and I suspect she asked me just because i'm my brothers sister. I of course agreed and I was even fine with her putting me in whatever style she wanted so long as it didn't involve me cutting/dyeing my hair you know any major changes. It's not my day I can suck up an ugly dress and act like it's gorgeous if that makes her happy. \n\nThe issue however is that i'm a wheelchair user. I know that the wedding venue is fine for me as it's our local church, totally accessible so all good. It's the venue being used for the reception that worries me. I asked her where the reception was going to be and if it was accessible for me and had an accessible bathroom, you know just covering my bases. She didn't get back to me. I figured she was busy so left it a week or so before chasing her up again to reask. She told me she wasn't sure so I asked where it was and she told me. \n\nI ended up looking up the building and my heart sank, it is an old building, not accessible at all for me and no bathrooms I could feasibly use either. I told her this and she got very upset saying my brother had told her that he'd cover the cost and she should just pick whatever she loved and that she loved this. She then went on to suggest that we could just have someone carry me into the building and my family or the other bridesmaids could help me use the bathroom when needed which the very idea of mortified me. I'm not about to agree to being carried in and needing help to go to the bathroom. \n\nI ended up giving her two options, if she wanted me at the reception she needed to pick somewhere that was accessible. If she didn't pick somewhere accessible then i'd of course still be her bridesmaid at the wedding but i'd have to skip the reception. She got upset at this as she feels like everyone especially my family will notice my absence and question it and it'll make her look bad. She then told me I was making this about me which wasn't fair when it was her day.\n\nI won't lie at this point I was enraged, I wanted to tell my brother to let him sort this but I wasn't about to start shit between them over this and I pointed out to her that yes this was her day and I had no intention of making about me however by marrying my brother she was joining our family and she needed to realise that she was not as sensitive as she thought she was and suggesting that I be carried into the building and aided going to the bathroom was downright insulting. \n\nThis led to a larger fight and she told me if my brother didn't already know I was her bridesmaid that she'd not want me to be it anymore. I called it quits at that point and told her she had my two  options and it was up to her which she wanted.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

Give him the chance not make this right in case he truly doesn\u2019t appreciate how inaccessible the reception location is.", "NTA \n\nAs somebody who used to work for weddings/functions, people with some kind of handicap or condition are **high priority** whether it's a person with a dietary requirement or a wheelchair user. \n\nYou have every right to be upset and displeased about how non-accessible the venue is. This was poor planning on her part and she should've chosen a better location for the wedding. \n\nI understand it's her day but she insisted that you come to the wedding, so not accommodating for you is pretty rude. You even suggested that you'd be at least there for the wedding but not reception. \n\nShe still was not happy about it so I guess you only had one option left, which was what you did. Your brother should reconsider.. She seems very selfish in this post.", "NTA\n\nShe was completely out of line to ignore your requests for information about accessibility, especially given that you are going to be part of her new family AND her bridal party.\n\nThis is on her.  You asked early, she ignored you.  She can have the venue she wants, and you're not stopping her, but she has NO grounds to demand you attend at a venue that doesn't accommodate you.  \n\nTBH, I know that you don't want to get your brother involved, but I think it might be a good idea before this gets too out of hand.  Don't tear her apart, but just be very gracious.  \"I'm so excited to be in your wedding, but it looks like the reception is going to be off the table for me due to the venue being inaccessible.\"  \n\nAlso, kind of confused why your brother didn't make it abundantly clear to her that each venue needed to be wheelchair accessible, when he's lived with you your whole life.  I hope he's not often that inconsiderate either.  \n\nThis isn't making her wedding about you.  This is you simply declining an invitation that doesn't actually include you.

If she chooses to keep it there then she\u2019s choosing for others to notice and ask questions and she\u2019s choosing to exclude you.", "definitely NTA. you even gave reasonable solutions, sure changing the location would be a bit much but you said you would gladly still be in the wedding, just not the reception. she doesn't seem to realize how uncomfortable it would be to be carried or need to be taken to the bathroom when you're fully capable so long as there's minimal accessibility. asking for necessary things like wheelchair accessibility -- especially when you're *in* the wedding *and* immediate family is the bare minimum. it's not like you demanded everything be made to suit you, it's just the reception you'd be missing. she sounds like a bridezilla. you're 100% NTA.", "NTA at all! She needs to check her ableism whether it\u2019s her wedding or not. I think you were very accommodating and your two options were more than fair. Stick to your word. Your dignity is worth it.", "NTA, You weren't at all demanding or unreasonable. You gave her perfectly good options and she chose to ignore it and take it out on you which isn't right.

She said he said he would \u201ccover it\u201d but what does that mean? Cost? Accommodations? I\u2019m irritated at him for not specifying it needs to be wheelchair accessible.\n\nI understand if it wasn\u2019t her first thought especially if she is not used to having to accommodate a family member in a wheelchair, and can totally understand her disappointment if her heart was set on the location. At the end of the day you\u2019re right, she is marrying into a family and needs to start thinking that way AND you shouldn\u2019t have to give up your dignity by not at the bare minimum having an accessible bathroom. \n\nTalk to your brother calmly addressing your concern with the reception site.

This is your own brother's wedding after all, you deserve to be comfortable and given at least minimum accessibility to necessary facilities. You even offered a compromise of not going to the reception if she was set on the venue to avoid making it your day.

She is choosing to be excessively selfish. She is choosing not to accommodate you. I get wanting to be the peacemaker and not cause strife amongst family, but this isn't on you. That will be on her to explain your absence, especially given that you were a bridesmaid and now you're not due to her actions of effectively excluding you from the reception. \n\nIt's really not that hard to accommodate other people for your wedding day if you're not a selfish asshole. When my husband and I got married, it was top of mind for me to make sure both venues were wheelchair-accessible. My husband's grandmother (who raised him), was a wheelchair user, and I made sure the wedding and reception venues were accessible. My husband didn't have to tell me - the most important thing was that the people who matter most to us could participate in our big day without barriers. \n\nThere is no excuse for your future SIL to behave this way.

This is his wedding, too, & he is just as responsible for ensuring the needs of his guests are met as is his fianc\u00e9e. If anything, your brother is a bigger AH because he is your brother & has a greater duty to you than his fianc\u00e9e does. Take this to your brother & let him handle it.", "NTA, but I think if it\u2019s not too late (if you haven\u2019t bought a dress and stuff etc), the most gracious thing would be to step out of the wedding party. Then you don\u2019t have to worry about anything (you don\u2019t sound like you want to be a bridesmaid anyways), and it makes a point to her, without you actually doing anything vindictive. \n\nI\u2019m just worried at this point in time, if anything goes wrong at the wedding she\u2019s going ti claim it\u2019s your fault. I\u2019m getting weird vibes from her too like she somehow thinks you\u2019ll steal the spotlight since you\u2019re in a wheelchair.", "NTA. It\u2019s also a bit shit that your brother didn\u2019t proactively look out for you too. It would have been nice for him to specify she should look for an accessible venue.\n\nBeing a man isn\u2019t an excuse for being uninvolved in the wedding plan.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry about this ordeal. Im sure you thought this could just be a happy occasion.", "NTA! You were extremely diplomatic by offering to be in the wedding and skip the reception. You definitely are not \u201cmaking the wedding about you.\u201d Bride crossed all boundaries of common decency when she suggested that you could be carried in and that others could help you with toilet matters. That\u2019s a hard no. Absofuckinglutely not. She owes you an apology for even suggesting that. If she has her heart set on the reception venue then she needs to accept your extremely gracious offer to skip the reception. Also is it just me who finds it odd that this venue isn\u2019t wheelchair accessible? Don\u2019t reception venues need to accommodate all sorts of folks?", "NTA. What grown adult would be cool with other wedding guests helping them to use the toilet? Honestly I get she might have her heart set on a venue, but she can\u2019t expect you to lose your dignity over it. I was in a wheelchair for a few years and this is honestly horrific to read.

Are there any laws that enforce accessibility?", "\n\nYou have every right to feel uncomfortable and not attend the reception, but it\u2019s ridiculous to ask her to change her reception booking mid planning\n\nPurely on the fact that she had a hissy fit I\u2019ll go with NTA.\n\nEdit - Your brother should\u2019ve known better and had more input in making sure it was accessible in the first place.", "I\u2019m sorry, what did I just read?

Your family will see her true colors, as will your brother and if he still wants to marry somebody who doesn't accept his sister that's up to him but she was extremely wrong for what she did and said.

I need a bathroom stall that can fit my mom, the wheelchair and myself.  Our choice of restaurant's is limited.  Most family members houses are not accessible for us.  You are not wrong.

You gave her a fair compromise which is you can attend the wedding but won't be able to go to the reception if she has it there.\n\nThe bit I find interesting though is that your brother hasn't picked up on this.

Let him handle the fall out.", "They do and it's rare lately that i'll encounter a venue nowadays that doesn't accommodate to this. 9 times out of 10 it's no issue at all, but there is always the odd one and this is an older building.", "The UK and yes there are however historic buildings are a grey area and so long as actual weddings aren't being held there they don't have to be fully accessible.", "\u201cRidiculous to ask her to change venue\u201d\n\nNo it isn\u2019t. And OP didn\u2019t ask her to, she told her she couldn\u2019t attend that venue. It is ridiculous to ask someone to be your bridesmaid to an event which they can\u2019t enter or use the bathroom. Then to blame them for making them look bad\u2026", "It is an ultimatum because those are the only two options I will entertain. I refuse to be carried into a building and helped to go to the bathroom for her vision.", "Ultimatum?  It\u2019s reality. Either change the venue or OP can\u2019t go.  \n\nThe bride is having a tantrum because if OP skips the reception, it will make the bride look bad.  Boo boo. She is a shitty future SIL anyway.  Brother really dropped the ball by not participating or not caring if his sister could physically be able to attend an event.\n\nOP is NTA", "You seem nice.", "isn't that just as much of an ultimatum?", "It doesn't sound like she has any desire to fix the situation. Given how far out in advance venues are booked, you may want to bring this up to your brother sooner rather than later.", "You would not be the cause of the fight. The bride's utter lack of consideration for her fiance's family would be the reason for conflict and your brother should know what kind of person he is planning on spending the rest of his life with, if he doesn't know already. Based on your other comment about how he would normally pick a fight with someone over an issue like this, there's a high chance he wouldn't want to marry someone whose values regarding such a matter are so fundamentally different from his.", "But.... wouldn't your brother want to be sure the venue was accessible??? You know, coz you're his sister and accessibility should be something glaringly obvious and important to someone who loves a wheelchair user?\n\nTalk to your brother, now. You've been put in a horrendous position by someone who is soon to become family. If you're brother isn't an A H, he'll see the problem and rectify it.", "You are his sister. Blaming her and her alone is unfair. He should have been involved in choosing the venue, at least as far as making sure it was accessible for his sister. Sure, she sucks a little for not being more sensitive once you pointed out the problem. But that doesn't excuse your brother. ESH", "It's better not to cause a scene and also don't attend. If they change it at this point, it's basically charity and you have more self respect than that. Go out with your friends that day and just chill.", "Yeah, I was confused why OP never talked to her relative.", "Yeah know. She knows that Op is in a wheelchair and apart of the wedding party, so why would she not research to make sure that op can, at the very least, USE THE BATHROOM. Her getting pissed at Op for wanting very basic things, is ridiculous. Her refusing accommodate Op because she wants a perfect venue says a lot about", "The brother probably doesn\u2019t know. Also, how is she having golden child syndrome because she\u2019s wants to be able to get into the venue without being carried around and to be able to USE THE BATHROOM", "If I were him, I'd want to know if my fianc\u00e9e was treating my disabled sister this way.", "It's understandable that you don't want to be the source of one of their arguments, but it won't be your fault.  Your FSIL apparently needs some disability education, and your brother is the one who should be doing it for her, not you.  If it causes them a fight, then I think it's a topic that definitely needs to be addressed before they make an incredibly difficult to reverse legal commitment to each other.  \n\nThe fact that he doesn't know about it worries me.  The fact that she basically told you she'd remove you from the bridal party if her future husband didn't already know she'd invited you tells me she might have a cruel streak he REALLY needs to know about.\n\nShe's his future wife, but you're his sister.  He almost assuredly WANTS you to share in his special day and the memories and may feel very hurt and betrayed by everybody if that doesn't happen and he didn't even know that it was happening before it was too late.  I'm sure he also wants a wife that genuinely treats his family humanely and with respect.\n\nIt isn't fun to shine a light on people, especially if you know it might hurt someone you love, but sometimes it is necessary.  \n\nIt's possible that this is just wedding stress for both of them, and that getting it out into the open will give everyone an opportunity to figure out how to tackle it.  But with people not communicating well, and ESPECIALLY given that FSIL is starting to venture into some ableist nonsense, I think it's gotten beyond the point of dealing with it privately by yourself.  \n\nDo you have another family member that you might be able to confide in that knows the family well enough to help?  One of your parents?", "NTA! \n\nAs a Deaf person, I\u2019ve had my family sometimes forgetting to inform others about accessibility  because it\u2019s so obviously natural to them to have things accessible lol. Agreed your brother probably thought she\u2019d get an accessible place. \n\nThe issue more than your brother\u2019s finance not getting the accessible site. It\u2019s yikes how she\u2019s reacting to your attempt to provide solutions. AND not listening to your refusal of having someone carrying you and your independence of bathroom use being taken away! \n\nWe can explain to abled bodied but it can be energy draining. She can easily look up info and tips. \n\nIMHO she should change the venue. And change her ableism approach. Hope she\u2019ll learn and unpack privilege if she wants to be part of your side of the family.", "You NEED to tell him. If he cares for you... and I'm assuming he does... the way his fianc\u00e9e is acting is a huge red flag.\n\nLet me ask you this. If you found out she was cheating on him, wouldn't you tell him? If you found out she likes to kill puppies for fun, wouldn't you tell him?\n\nShe's showing you a part of her personality, that he urgently needs to know before marring her, so he can make an informed decision.\n\nHe probably didn't stipulated to his fianc\u00e9e the reception needs to be wheelchair accessible was because for him it was obvious.\n\nYou would be a huge asshole if you don't tell him this, because in the future he will found out, and will possibly break up with her. And you could've save him a huge amount of pain by being honest with him now. Go tell him NOW.", "You\u2019re a peacekeeper and I can see that. I myself don\u2019t like to stir up drama, but being a bridesmaid when I\u2019m not wanted, would make me feel so uncomfortable and I couldn\u2019t suck that up.", "Without knowing for sure how your brother would feel, I will say if you were my sister and my fianc\u00e9e was treating you like this I would want to know. It would mean some serious conversations on my end that I would want to have before the wedding. If you think your brother would have feelings about her choosing a venue over his sibling and you can think of calm way to approach it, I would loop him in. Some waves are worth making and if this is a side of the fianc\u00e9e your brother isn\u2019t aware of he might appreciate the heads up.", "Weddings are stressful and it is wildly inconsiderate of her not to make sure there is access for you. \n\nI am willing to bet, she got wrapped up with the venue and a vision and it slipped her mind. Now it\u2019s crashing around her because of situation. Not defending but explaining what likely may be the situation and believe there\u2019s grace for you both. \n\nI think it\u2019s a lack of communication as your brother should\u2019ve specified and not assumed.\n\nI truly believe the right thing is to have a conversation with them both together, don\u2019t accuse but state your concerns and see what conclusions come from there. Family dynamics can be rough and the goal is to maintain a loving family relationship", "Your brother doesn\u2019t sound like the AH. I think he assumed his future bride would be more considerate and thoughtful. You definitely are not the asshole Good luck.", "Uhhh... my spidey sense is tingling. This actually feels deliberate to me - of ALL of the venues she could have chosen she just *happened* to fall in love with one of the few that isn't accessible? It's a real character defining moment and your brother deserves to know that he is about to marry someone not only unkind but passive aggressive. Please talk to him. The fallout will not be your fault in any way.", "OP admitted it\u2019s an ultimatum, which is what makes them TA. Simply declining is sufficient, and the bride could have been the only AH with her tantrum and facing OP\u2019s brother when he finds out why she can\u2019t be there.", "Most people don\u2019t really comprehend what \u201cnice\u201d is. Your sarcasm is actually appreciated.", "No, it\u2019s a statement of fact. OP can\u2019t go to the venue because it can\u2019t accommodate their needs.\n\nInvitations aren\u2019t negotiations.", "Yeah, I kind of agree with this approach. My partner's sister is celiac, so it was part of both of our wedding planning from the word go that we'd have plenty of gf options, ingredients listed on everything and a gf cake. I almost typed that it would have made me super sad to see her excluded but the thing is that was just... never an option. I'd hope that's the normal way of doing things and I'm confused why the bride didn't have wheelchair accessibility at all in mind when she made her decision. On top of her angry reaction (instead of like 'oh shit! I'm so sorry, I'm a mess how was I not thinking of that?! We'll work something out') that feels like it needs a conversation with OP's bro.", "I couldn't imagine not considering my guests.  My husbands aunt is Deaf. I made sure I organised an interpreter for our wedding. If anyone attending required wheelchair access I would have chosen the other accessible location at the venue for the ceremony (instead of on the river bank) it's just basic considerations.", "Thank you, you're right of course. I really hope it's not an indication of a cruel streak as I don't want to think that of her. I'm really hoping it's just the stress of the wedding getting to her but maybe I should bring it up to him before they get married to be safe. I will likely discuss this with my parents to and get them to weigh in on this matter."]}
