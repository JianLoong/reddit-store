She and I aren't particularly close but I don't dislike her and I suspect she asked me just because i'm my brothers sister. I of course agreed and I was even fine with her putting me in whatever style she wanted so long as it didn't involve me cutting/dyeing my hair you know any major changes. It's not my day I can suck up an ugly dress and act like it's gorgeous if that makes her happy. \n\nThe issue however is that i'm a wheelchair user. I know that the wedding venue is fine for me as it's our local church, totally accessible so all good. It's the venue being used for the reception that worries me. I asked her where the reception was going to be and if it was accessible for me and had an accessible bathroom, you know just covering my bases. She didn't get back to me. I figured she was busy so left it a week or so before chasing her up again to reask. She told me she wasn't sure so I asked where it was and she told me. \n\nI ended up looking up the building and my heart sank, it is an old building, not accessible at all for me and no bathrooms I could feasibly use either. I told her this and she got very upset saying my brother had told her that he'd cover the cost and she should just pick whatever she loved and that she loved this. She then went on to suggest that we could just have someone carry me into the building and my family or the other bridesmaids could help me use the bathroom when needed which the very idea of mortified me. I'm not about to agree to being carried in and needing help to go to the bathroom. \n\nI ended up giving her two options, if she wanted me at the reception she needed to pick somewhere that was accessible. If she didn't pick somewhere accessible then i'd of course still be her bridesmaid at the wedding but i'd have to skip the reception. She got upset at this as she feels like everyone especially my family will notice my absence and question it and it'll make her look bad. She then told me I was making this about me which wasn't fair when it was her day.\n\nI won't lie at this point I was enraged, I wanted to tell my brother to let him sort this but I wasn't about to start shit between them over this and I pointed out to her that yes this was her day and I had no intention of making about me however by marrying my brother she was joining our family and she needed to realise that she was not as sensitive as she thought she was and suggesting that I be carried into the building and aided going to the bathroom was downright insulting. \n\nThis led to a larger fight and she told me if my brother didn't already know I was her bridesmaid that she'd not want me to be it anymore. I called it quits at that point and told her she had my two  options and it was up to her which she wanted.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

Give him the chance not make this right in case he truly doesn\u2019t appreciate how inaccessible the reception location is.", "NTA \n\nAs somebody who used to work for weddings/functions, people with some kind of handicap or condition are **high priority** whether it's a person with a dietary requirement or a wheelchair user. \n\nYou have every right to be upset and displeased about how non-accessible the venue is. This was poor planning on her part and she should've chosen a better location for the wedding. \n\nI understand it's her day but she insisted that you come to the wedding, so not accommodating for you is pretty rude. You even suggested that you'd be at least there for the wedding but not reception. \n\nShe still was not happy about it so I guess you only had one option left, which was what you did. Your brother should reconsider.. She seems very selfish in this post.", "NTA\n\nShe was completely out of line to ignore your requests for information about accessibility, especially given that you are going to be part of her new family AND her bridal party.\n\nThis is on her.  You asked early, she ignored you.  She can have the venue she wants, and you're not stopping her, but she has NO grounds to demand you attend at a venue that doesn't accommodate you.  \n\nTBH, I know that you don't want to get your brother involved, but I think it might be a good idea before this gets too out of hand.  Don't tear her apart, but just be very gracious.  \"I'm so excited to be in your wedding, but it looks like the reception is going to be off the table for me due to the venue being inaccessible.\"  \n\nAlso, kind of confused why your brother didn't make it abundantly clear to her that each venue needed to be wheelchair accessible, when he's lived with you your whole life.  I hope he's not often that inconsiderate either.  \n\nThis isn't making her wedding about you.  This is you simply declining an invitation that doesn't actually include you.

If she chooses to keep it there then she\u2019s choosing for others to notice and ask questions and she\u2019s choosing to exclude you.", "definitely NTA. you even gave reasonable solutions, sure changing the location would be a bit much but you said you would gladly still be in the wedding, just not the reception. she doesn't seem to realize how uncomfortable it would be to be carried or need to be taken to the bathroom when you're fully capable so long as there's minimal accessibility. asking for necessary things like wheelchair accessibility -- especially when you're *in* the wedding *and* immediate family is the bare minimum. it's not like you demanded everything be made to suit you, it's just the reception you'd be missing. she sounds like a bridezilla. you're 100% NTA.", "NTA at all! She needs to check her ableism whether it\u2019s her wedding or not. I think you were very accommodating and your two options were more than fair. Stick to your word. Your dignity is worth it.", "NTA, You weren't at all demanding or unreasonable. You gave her perfectly good options and she chose to ignore it and take it out on you which isn't right.

She said he said he would \u201ccover it\u201d but what does that mean? Cost? Accommodations? I\u2019m irritated at him for not specifying it needs to be wheelchair accessible.\n\nI understand if it wasn\u2019t her first thought especially if she is not used to having to accommodate a family member in a wheelchair, and can totally understand her disappointment if her heart was set on the location. At the end of the day you\u2019re right, she is marrying into a family and needs to start thinking that way AND you shouldn\u2019t have to give up your dignity by not at the bare minimum having an accessible bathroom. \n\nTalk to your brother calmly addressing your concern with the reception site.

This is your own brother's wedding after all, you deserve to be comfortable and given at least minimum accessibility to necessary facilities. You even offered a compromise of not going to the reception if she was set on the venue to avoid making it your day.

She is choosing to be excessively selfish. She is choosing not to accommodate you. I get wanting to be the peacemaker and not cause strife amongst family, but this isn't on you. That will be on her to explain your absence, especially given that you were a bridesmaid and now you're not due to her actions of effectively excluding you from the reception. \n\nIt's really not that hard to accommodate other people for your wedding day if you're not a selfish asshole. When my husband and I got married, it was top of mind for me to make sure both venues were wheelchair-accessible. My husband's grandmother (who raised him), was a wheelchair user, and I made sure the wedding and reception venues were accessible. My husband didn't have to tell me - the most important thing was that the people who matter most to us could participate in our big day without barriers. \n\nThere is no excuse for your future SIL to behave this way.

Take this to your brother & let him handle it.", "NTA, but I think if it\u2019s not too late (if you haven\u2019t bought a dress and stuff etc), the most gracious thing would be to step out of the wedding party. Then you don\u2019t have to worry about anything (you don\u2019t sound like you want to be a bridesmaid anyways), and it makes a point to her, without you actually doing anything vindictive. \n\nI\u2019m just worried at this point in time, if anything goes wrong at the wedding she\u2019s going ti claim it\u2019s your fault. I\u2019m getting weird vibes from her too like she somehow thinks you\u2019ll steal the spotlight since you\u2019re in a wheelchair.", "NTA. It\u2019s also a bit shit that your brother didn\u2019t proactively look out for you too. It would have been nice for him to specify she should look for an accessible venue.\n\nBeing a man isn\u2019t an excuse for being uninvolved in the wedding plan.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019m sorry about this ordeal. Im sure you thought this could just be a happy occasion.", "NTA! You were extremely diplomatic by offering to be in the wedding and skip the reception. You definitely are not \u201cmaking the wedding about you.\u201d Bride crossed all boundaries of common decency when she suggested that you could be carried in and that others could help you with toilet matters. That\u2019s a hard no. Absofuckinglutely not. She owes you an apology for even suggesting that. If she has her heart set on the reception venue then she needs to accept your extremely gracious offer to skip the reception. Also is it just me who finds it odd that this venue isn\u2019t wheelchair accessible? Don\u2019t reception venues need to accommodate all sorts of folks?", "NTA. What grown adult would be cool with other wedding guests helping them to use the toilet? Honestly I get she might have her heart set on a venue, but she can\u2019t expect you to lose your dignity over it. I was in a wheelchair for a few years and this is honestly horrific to read.

Are there any laws that enforce accessibility?", "\n\nYou have every right to feel uncomfortable and not attend the reception, but it\u2019s ridiculous to ask her to change her reception booking mid planning\n\nPurely on the fact that she had a hissy fit I\u2019ll go with NTA.\n\nEdit - Your brother should\u2019ve known better and had more input in making sure it was accessible in the first place.", "I\u2019m sorry, what did I just read?

Your family will see her true colors, as will your brother and if he still wants to marry somebody who doesn't accept his sister that's up to him but she was extremely wrong for what she did and said.

I need a bathroom stall that can fit my mom, the wheelchair and myself.  Our choice of restaurant's is limited.  Most family members houses are not accessible for us.  You are not wrong.

You gave her a fair compromise which is you can attend the wedding but won't be able to go to the reception if she has it there.\n\nThe bit I find interesting though is that your brother hasn't picked up on this.

If it causes them a fight, then I think it's a topic that definitely needs to be addressed before they make an incredibly difficult to reverse legal commitment to each other.  \n\nThe fact that he doesn't know about it worries me.  The fact that she basically told you she'd remove you from the bridal party if her future husband didn't already know she'd invited you tells me she might have a cruel streak he REALLY needs to know about.\n\nShe's his future wife, but you're his sister.  He almost assuredly WANTS you to share in his special day and the memories and may feel very hurt and betrayed by everybody if that doesn't happen and he didn't even know that it was happening before it was too late.

How is it possible that none of them even thought about this for a second?", "NTA, and I think you've been much nicer about it than I would have been! It sounds like she's not going to make the accommodation for you so you're probably better to speak to your brother. Preferably soon, depending upon how soon the wedding is, places get booked up quickly so he would need to find an alternative as soon as he can.", "YTA. Maybe she just liked the location. She\u2019s not in a wheelchair so I\u2019m sure her first thought when looking at a place is does it meet what I want for a reception not if the bathroom is ADA compliant. I do believe planning a wedding is stressful and after Covid I believe it is still tight to find a reception hall. So I don\u2019t believe she picked it out of spite. By the time you asked I think she realized it wasn\u2019t ADA compliant and it would be a problem. Probably to late to change and probably would loose a deposit. You could have just said you wouldn\u2019t go to the reception but you started this madness ie said you were \u201cenraged\u201d so you know you were pissed.

You communicated your concern with the utmost consideration and gave her two possible options. The fact that she was thoughtless in her preparations and aggressive when confronted on it speaks volumes.", "It's honestly wild how often people think \"get carried\" is any kind of solution to lack of accessibility for wheelchair users. A lot of office buildings still have in their fire procedures that wheelchair users should wait in a \"safe area\" until they can be carried out of the building by others. It's a burning building, what on earth constitutes a safe enough area for people with disabilities to wait until multiple others decide to help carry them out? The less people see \"oh just let someone carry you\" as a solution, the safer the world starts to get for wheelchair users.", "Those laws generally apply to new construction, not modifications to existing structures. It's very difficult to get permission to modify a historic building in a lot of places, there's a ton of extra paperwork and permitting to ensure that the historic building isn't damaged.", "Respectfully, from this response, it sounds like a fight between them is exactly what you hope to provoke.   If you tell him now he can talk to her and they can work it out.   That would be the mature low drama way to handle this.

The way I misread it was that fianc\u00e9 already rescinded the bridesmaid invite. At any rate, what a mess this is. OP just needs to have a chat with her brother.
