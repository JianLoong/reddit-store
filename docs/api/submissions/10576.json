With 2 packs and asking to buy a bit more. \nI finally said no, explaining I can't afford this and I actually need it to function on a daily basis for my mental illnesses. \n\nThen today, he sent me another message, not for weed. But asking me to let his girlfriend, their friend and child go my home as they've forgotten their key and apparently there's a way through my home, I didn't know this was even a thing. \nBut as he's not a good native speaker to my area, things might have been misunderstood.\nHe kept telling me there's a way through some wires but I keep telling him no, there is no way (from what I've seen and I've been going through my whole home) \nIn the end, I said \"listen, there is no door or anything to your home through mine, I'm sorry but no. \"\n\nHe told me I'm rude and said he'd let them stay in their car until he got home with a key. \n\nSo Reddit.

Firstly never give someone free drugs. I know MJ is legal in many places but it's still a commodity that people are after. Don't advertise that you have it regularly to strangers. This guy saw that you were friendly and he put a target on your head as someone to get things from.\n\nAs for them wanting in your house, I would talk to the landlord about that. I mean is there some hidden door in the back of your closet? I've seen lots of houses divided into apartments and strange doors do happen; but I would think you would have noticed by now. \n\nIf there is no door then he's trying to get people into your apartment.... why? I don't like the feel of this at all.", "INFO: I don\u2019t understand\u2026 so he claims there\u2019s a way to get into his upstairs from your place?", "NTA. OP, please do not let strange people into your house. That's just not safe. This is certainly not an emergency.", "NTA. Sounds very sketchy, like they wanted an excuse to case your home, maybe pinch your weed.", "NTA You do not owe anyone access to your home.  Also it is a little creepy.", "NTA. Your space is *your* space. They can figure out the key situation on their own. I'm convinced he's just trying to get some of your weed stash, tbh. And definitely stick to your boundary on him getting weed from you. He can take that on to someone else and pay for it, lol.", "NTA- I'd be finding out how they think they are getting through and put a huge lock on that door or make sure it is blocked off so they can sneak in.", "NTA - it\u2019s good to set firm boundaries now. Your neighbor locking herself out is simply not your problem, and even if this door did actually exist, it still would be okay for you to say no to that request.", "NTA That is a strange request...and also creepy. In my mind, I'm wondering if he wanted a way into your place to steal some of your weed, since you said no to him. You never know? You most definitely need to contact your landlord and ask about this supposed entryway between the two places. That is scary and needs to be closed off.", "NTA next time he's at your door ask him to show you how he thinks they could get through and then make sure you block it off properly", "NTA. I think he wants to look for weed and/or money in your home. Don't let him in. Always lock your doors. Put cameras around the property.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
