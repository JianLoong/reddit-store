(He lies and claims poverty to Child Support Court, but is paid much more under the table.)\n\nI have dad's almost exact location from my son's Snapchat location; I'd just have drive by there when I'm in the area to get the correct house.\n\nWithout giving too many details, this money would be life-changing for our living situation right now. The court/child support no longer has his current address, and dad has no intention of them having that information. \nHe's been warned by the court that he's at the point in non-payment where he'd go to jail** if they had his location.\n\nWIBTA if I use the information I inadvertently got from my son to send Child Support Services after him?\n\n**Before you ask, I know it sound counterintuitive to put someone in jail for child support, because how can they pay if they can't work? \n1. He hasn't paid since 2020, though he works a well-paying job, just doesn't file taxes  (a whole other issue he should get in trouble for), so it's not like current payments would stop if he were in jail. \n2. In my state, when someone is put in jail for non-payment, they have to pay a portion of the arrears (usually 1/3 or 1/2) to get out of jail, and all of that money would go to us (aside from court fees).\n\n...\n\nEDIT answer a question I've seen a couple times: His dad picks him up. The onus is on him for transportation for visits.\nHe also moves frequently (much due to being behind on child support), so it's hard to keep up with his addresses.\n\nI can't legally keep my son from visiting. I have custody, but he has visitation. He's supposed to give me his current address (legally), but the judge would frown upon me not allowing visits due to not knowing where he lives.\n\nYears ago, when our son was 7-8, dad was couch hopping and still expected visits. I didn't send son until he had a fixed residence, and when that was brought up in custody court, the judge was upset and called it \"vindictive,\" even though I was only withholding visits out of safety. I still won that case, but it isn't looked upon favorably.\n\nMy concern back then in not sending him was abuse by one of the random people that my ex would be staying with, as I didn't know who any of them were, and my son was too young to give details.\n\nNow that he's a teen and can articulate his needs/wants, I follow his lead a bit more. Like currently, he went to stay to earn a bit of money working over the summer for his dad.\n\nSECOND EDIT because some are wondering why I'd send our son when dad is so far behind on support: \nChild support and custody visits are separate, and rightfully so. My ex isn't just a financial deadbeat, but he's also not a very good person. (He was my abuser and we had to flee him when son was 2. He's still verbally abusive to me over the smallest things regarding visits. Yes; abusers still get visitation.) \n\nI say \"rightfully so\" for the system overall, even though I don't like my ex. We wouldn't want a really good but indigent/hard-on-their-luck parent to not be allowed to see their child just because they can't afford support.

I have a hard time believing a judge would allow visits by an abuser. \n\nNot having access to his residence is a massive problem. What if there is an emergency? You need to be able to know where he is to get your son. \n\nIf the judge is as fed up of you as what I'm gathering from your post and comments, then there is absolutely no way you're telling the entire truth about what is going on. \n\nWhy is the State not deducting from his job? They usually do that after a job change. \n\nWhy are you so worried about the dad's taxes? You're not the IRS, but when he does file them eventually, you do realize you will get all the money from the taxes he files since he owes CS?\n\nI'm going to probably go against opinion here and rule as ESH. Your job as a mother is not to be going tooth and nail after dad - even though he was an abuser to you and is a financial asshead. Your job is to focus on your child - not to trash the other parent or try to ruin his life, which  undoubtedly affect your child emotionally. And just because you're owed does not mean you will instantly see the money if you ever do. My advice would be to stop being so obsessive over Dad, and focus on your relationship with your child. I personally would not do it as it's almost a 100% guarantee your child will hate you for their adulthood. \n\nYou also need to see a lawyer about your custody agreement if you want it changed.", "NTA.

He is reaping what he sows. Honestly, You're not getting all that money if you haven't already. But you'll probably do quite a bit of damage to your relationship with your child.
