I've also been in interracial relationships. They are a lot of work, in a very different way. It's one thing when two family identities come together (your wife's and yours), add on the cultural element, that's a whole other beast. \n\nFamily topics are often very sensitive. We have a hard time seeing the harm they each cause, and well, there is no such thing as a perfect family. I guess it would be more \"tolerable\". You grew up with yours, she grew up with hers. \n\nYour language in explaining all of this is questionable. \"Stepped away from that culture\" and \"bringing her family around\". I'm hoping that you don't think that having her family there is \"cultural\". \"Isn't very kind to women\"...I'm in Canada, the lens I'm looking through the US is equally unkind to women, and that in itself is imbedded in the \"American Culture\". Pay equity body autonomy, career, maternity leave, domestic violence, etc. I'm exhausted hearing it depends on the State, no, it's America! \n\nYou comparing the families sounds immature. It's like when parents compare their children to others, so what? You have an experience with your family that feels \"normal\", you wife may not. If you're speaking like this, I can only imagine what micro-aggressions they've subjected her to, including ridiculing her \"culture\". BTW, you can't \"step away\" from culture, you can identify your relationship with it and act accordingly. Which is what I've done, but I'm still South Asian. \n\nWhen I was with my ex, (white, American/Canadians) his friends kept telling me how lovely they are. I was the first POC he brought home. It went great, they really were lovely and I felt at home in an instance. The next year before going back for the holidays, his brother visited, he started sharing his distance from his parents. My ex asked why, he said they have views he does not agree with. That winter, ya, they made so many racially charged comments, what white people would refer to as \"micro-aggressions\". My ex was first in denial, then in shock. To this day, I swear if his brother hadn't supported me, I don't know if my ex would have seen or believed it. \n\nCulturally, South Asians focus is on building and maintaining relationships. You've benefited from this. This is basic linguist and cultural diversity. You wife has likely kept her thoughts to herself over her experience with your parents. Her not telling you isn't her keeping a secret, it's her not feeling safe to tell you. And based on your whole \"they aren't crazy like hers\", from my end it's not misplaced. In fact, it's also screaming misogynistic and cultural bias. \n\nThere are not many men, males, who are open to hearing ANY criticism about their family. You're in an interracial relationship, your wife's culture was owned through colonization (that stays with us for generations), then she likely hears daily some form of South Asian hate. And you're wondering why she doesn't want your family there as if it's gotta be a tit for tat? \n\nInstead of spending time erasing and celebrating the erasure of her culture so that she has to assimilate, maybe learn about it. You can't wash off the colour of our skin!", "OP, this seems more like cultural views from her family, I always say you should put your kids first, this kind of seems like something more suited for r/relationshipadvice, just for now, I\u2019m not gonna render a judgement here, because we don\u2019t have enough context here.\n\nI will say this, it kind of seems like your wife is being a little hypocritical, but what you said, was kind of uncalled for, without any more context, I just can\u2019t render an opinion.", "I gotta say I'm kinda getting bad vibes here.\n\nYou honestly come off as claiming that you alone are the one in charge of determining what kind of exposure to others is acceptable for your kids.

My cousin said, and I quote, \u201cit\u2019s okay. She will find someone, at least she is smart.\u201d That line did more damage to me than I can even explain. Now, not all Indian families are so toxic. I\u2019ve met some wonderful Indian families that are truly loving and supportive. However, it sounds like your wife\u2019s family is more like mine.
