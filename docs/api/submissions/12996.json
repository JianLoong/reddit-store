We had 0 notice. We trained 0 before, I think drank some beers before it. Wife\u2019s sister and her boyfriend just walked it, me and my wife wanted to at least try, so we jogged ahead. Wife was just in better shape than me so i undoubtedly needed to stop and walk, more often / before she did. Wife always stopped with me, I said she can go ahead if wanted but she didn\u2019t want to. We finished, I was slightly down on how out of shape I was, but she was super positive, was great time. \n\n\nThis new years, I became resolutioner. I\u2019ve dieted, ran 3 times a week, worked out 6 times a week. I\u2019m making decent progress in all those areas. Wife super supportive and complimentary. Early January we signed up for 5k with friends in end of May. Friends specifically stated going to basically walk it, and there's fun event afterwards, I said \"yea, it's 5k, so can go whatever pace you want\", while admitting Im going to try to run it. I\u2019ve been specifically training my runs for 5k since. I\u2019ve talked about my times, wanting to do 5k better, etc. Been really striving for specific times, though I guess I didn\u2019t specifically go into details on exactly what I wanted from times, but it was pretty often discussed how much I was training for 5k. \n\n\nYesterday, wife casually mentioned she should run a couple times before race in may so I don't get too bored waiting for her during our 5k... I admitted I thought I was going to run ahead and then we'll do group stuff afterwards. She responded with, lightheartedly, how she waited for me last time... \n\nNow, i feel like a dick. She did wait for me last time. I actually told her and friends how sweet it was. But, I feel this is somewhat different? We live in Minnesota. I run before work, anywhere from 3-5 AM. I've been getting up and running in snow / cold at up to -20 F at times, it'll be 5 months of training all while I kept talking about 5k. This has been a weird motivating goal I've had throughout. \n\nShe said she gets it, gets difference since I'm training, but she's disappointed somewhat. I said \"well now I feel like an asshole\". She jokingly / light heartedly said, yea, a little bit asshole, but I get it, I might of done same if I were training for it.\n\n\nSo, not a major fight, and she's not type to hold this over me... but now I can't help but feel weird and wrong about it. I know if I jog ahead I'll feel like a dick.

I'm sure your wife will be out there supporting you when you run your first competitive race!\n\nYWBTA if you run ahead, sorry.", "NAH, but there are plenty of 5Ks on every calendar. Choose a different one to begin running competitively.", "YTA take the cues that this is one of those Forced Family Fun outings and not a serious 5k. 5ks are a dime a dozen, sign up for a 5k to run alone.", "Yeah, YWBTA. Pick another race to do on your own. You've got one chance to not be a dick- should be an easy decision.", "I don't get why you have to run ahead. She waited for you. You can't do the same, why?", "YTA\n\n\n It is the excat same thing. She was fitter as you. She spend time with you and you two had fun.\n\n\nThis year the plan was excatly the same. Just that you know you are fitter. \n\n\nWe (reddit commentors) don't know you, but you should reflect if it is a theme in your relationship, that she does stuff for you you clearly appretiate, but doing the same feels like an unjust and unnessary sacrifice? \n\n\n\n\n(It also sounds a bit like you only want to jog because everyone you know will be slower. There are so many 5ks but you need to jog this one and not simply a different one?)", "NAH\n\nThis sounds like a complete non-issue that the two of you are perfectly capable of figuring out without anyone being hurt or upset in the end.", "YTA - It\u2019s one race so you can put your ego aside to enjoy the race with your wife. If you are training on that level then there should be other races, right? And if it\u2019s a serious hobby then wouldn\u2019t you travel for some of the races farther away? Who exactly do you think you\u2019d be traveling to those races with? Who exactly would be cheering you on from the sidelines?\n\nThink long term. Ha!", "NAH but why don't you choose a different race and go for time then? Let your wife drive along and support you? Leave the one with your wife to be something you do together, there are so many races you can easily find another one to really compete in.", "YTA. It's not different. You can run 5 kilometers by yourself at any time and time yourself then. If you're not expecting to actually win the damn race, then you need to hang out with your wife like she did for you.", "YTA. You can and do run more in more competitive settings, and I don't see why, since you signed up for this as more of a social / together thing, you wouldn't prioritize that and the support / reciprocity to your wife that she provided you last time. \n\nLong story short - this isn't THE RACE in which to insist you must run ahead in order to get the best possible time. If you want to run alone, sign up for a different race alone.", "YTA for picking the group outing for this goal.  It\u2019s designed to be a together activity and you immediately decided to abandon the group.\n\nI would be hurt too if my SO left me behind on our planned date activity together.  Pick a different 5k.", "YTA. Why are you getting so competitive over a 5k? there are a million other 5ks you can run, take this one and be with your wife. Do you think she wants to be alone during the 5k? Would you have enjoyed being alone the previous year?", "I would say NAH, my suggestion is to run alongside her in this one and then choose another 5k to actually go for time.", "Your wife sounds really sweet. I am sure she understands you're working hard to achieve this. NTA if you run ahead this time. It's kind of your reward for working so hard toward the goal.", "YTA. You agreed to do this race TOGETHER. If you run ahead, this is not a joint activity, and it\u2019s not going to be fun for your wife to do this alone.", "YTA y'all signed up to do this 5k togeather, do it togeather. Sign up for a different 5k to do on your own.", "This is a FUN RUN that you are doing with friends. Sign up for another one if you want to race. YWBTA  a little.", "NTA - These situations are different. The first 5k was a spur-of-the-moment thing. For the second 5k, it seems like you have mentioned at least a few times that you have specific goals for this race and that you were looking forward to testing your potential. I don't think having different goals this time makes you an asshole, especially since it seems like you set expectations and have been talking about this.\n\nI'm a runner and I run races pretty regularly. I feel like the people commenting that you should just sign up for a different race are off base here for a few reasons. When you sign up for a target race, you plan your training around the timing of that race, and usually, people peak and taper their training based on the timing. Sometimes there are things about a specific race that make it more or less ideal (level of competition, weather, time of day, etc.). You also sounded really excited to run this one!", "Timed 5ks are on several times a week This doesn't sound like a serious road race. Spend the time with your wife and save your speed runs for more competitive events.\n\nYTA in this situation", "YTA.  Do a 5k alone if you want to challenge yourself.  Wife is right.", "NTA. The situations are very different. The last one was a complete surprise and just for fun - this one was talked about well in advance. You definitely *can* schedule another one separately to do by yourself, but I don't think there's anything wrong with going out and trying for a good time. Self improvement is hard and I get the motivating factor here so I really think your wife should be more understanding of that. Further, if she just wants to walk a 5k with you then you can do that without paying for an event", "Nta", "NTA \n\nUnfortunately she will feel a little bit hurt but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an asshole move. How you said you are training and want to do your best in the race. With that being said if you wanna save yourself a little argument you can always wait for her and sign up for another 5K. With how short 5Ks are they happen all the time. If it was a full marathon that happens like a few times a year it\u2019s different but with a 5K you can still definitely find a different one to try your hardest on.", "NTA.  She knew what you were training for, and your group of friends will be there for her to chat with.  Let's be honest, 5k's don't take that long, it's not like separating from her during a marathon.  \n\nIf you really feel bad though, as others have suggested, just sign up for a couple more 5k's on your own and take the slow lane with your wife and friends at the end of May.", "NTA If she supports your fitness goals, she should support your desire to run the whole thing whether she's beside you during the 5K or not. She can hang back with your friends.", "NTA. She chose to wait for you. You didn't ask her to. You've also been pretty upfront regarding your desire to run.  You shouldn't have to hold yourself back bc she made that choice for herself previously.", "NTA. If you'd insisted she wait with you last time then yeah, but you told her to go ahead and it was her decision. Also, I don't think people saying you're the asshole because you can just do a different 5K understand training for a run. If you have a specific time goal it's not as simple as doing one for fun, plus yeah it's a common race distance but that doesn't mean there's one every weekend in your area.", "YTA but not a big one. You had diffrent expectations. But your wife waited for you, you should wait for her. Itd be diffrent if you had discussed it beforehand but making little comments isnt telling her clearly what you want.", "YWBTA. If you want a 5K focused on individual performance, sign up for one individually. This woman sounds so supportive and, even when telling you that you are being an asshole, still jokes about it and doesn\u2019t push. You feel bad because you KNOW you would be a jerk and you\u2019re just hoping someone will say it\u2019s ok to do it anyway. It\u2019s not.", "NAH this probably isn\u2019t the race to treat like a measure of progress for your training. It\u2019s like a group activity under these circumstances . I\u2019d probably sign up for another race (there are lots throughout the year) that is specifically for the purpose of serious running and think of this one as a fun day with your wife.  I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole though because even your wife doesn\u2019t seem super upset about this. Just expressing her difference in opinion. It was a healthy conversation in my opinion.", "NTA As someone who runs slower than many people walk, I would never expect anyone to wait for me. In fact, I find it super stressful if they do.", "NAH, could you run this race with her and sign up for a different 5k to do for real? It sounds like this started as a fun \u201clet\u2019s do this together\u201d thing, and now that you\u2019ve been training you see the opportunity to repurpose it as a \u201cim gonna challenge myself\u201d thing. If there\u2019s another 5k you could race instead, then you can keep this one as your fun group activity.\n\nIf there\u2019s no other 5k to do then I would race this one (biased, former runner here). As long as she really is okay with it\u2026mildly disappointed, maybe, but ultimately giving a sincere go ahead. Racing is a different beast, it\u2019s NOT the same as running a 5k on your own, and I think it\u2019s a valuable experience. But I think you should find a nice way to thank your wife for giving up her couple time for you. A gift, or a separate outing focused on things she loves, idk\u2026you know her, you know what she likes! And give a sincere thank you for her support, and for her being willing to prioritize your wants over hers that day. AND if there\u2019s a time when you can do the same her (prioritize her wants over yours for something that matters to her), make sure you jump at the opportunity to do so.", "NAH Why not just sign up for another 5k alone to test yourself and run this one with your wife?", "Frankly you both sound like lovely, thoughtful people. I think it is sweet that you are thinking about this, asking us, you clearly feel conflicted about it and that makes you a not-asshole. \n\nThat being said, I think you already know what the right thing to do is. \n\nNAH for the vote.", "YTA and I would be careful tbh. You\u2019re kind of admitting to your wife that you won\u2019t be as patient and as thoughtful as she was towards you. That\u2019s not a good look. \n\nYou should have told her your intentions were to run it as soon as you understood they were just going to walk it. This was a fun group thing and you turned it into a competition for yourself. While wanting to actually run a 5k is perfectly fine, why this one? Why can\u2019t you sign up for one that\u2019s just for you? \n\nYour wife was there for you when you weren\u2019t in good shape, and you\u2019re telling her you won\u2019t return the favor. That\u2019s kind of an asshole move. If you wanted it to be different, then you should have made the situation different. She\u2019s not holding it over your head, but I doubt she loves the disparity in what you\u2019re willing to do for each other.", "NAH\n\nJust run with her until she can\u2019t, slow down some more, and have fun. This isn\u2019t a race.", "NTA, and you don't have to wait for her, but it would be nice if you did.  She sees this particular race as something for the two of you to do together.  Since you've been training for these, you should 100% sign up for some and do them on your own and have her come and cheer you on.  But I see this race as something different.  It's more like a \"date race\" if that makes sense?", "YTA  Run with your wife; you are not going for medals. Give her back the support she gave you.", "YTA\n\nThis walk/run was signed up as a group, you, your wife and your friends. Do this one with her and sign up for one to do yourself.

The one in our city is at the end of May and the one in my wife\u2019s family\u2019s city is end of September.

I talked about training and going all-in on these 5K\u2019s with my wife.

Your wife of doing the equivalent of \u201cwhy aren\u2019t you grateful for the things I did that you never asked for?\u201d You said she could go ahead, and she chose to stay.

You\u2019ve clearly communicated you wanted to run this from the start and though there was a hiccup in communication just now your wife has ultimately accepted your decision to run it. Now let it go and move on.\n\nYou are only responsible for your own emotions. At a certain point you need to be able to live with the fact that your wife maybe feels differently than you about this but that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person.

There was a particular 5k I wanted to do with him but he said it would throw off his practice schedule. I sincerely said, \u201cNo problem!\u201d . . . And then had the saddest, loneliest 5k in history. No one even cheering for me. He regrets it now. I did not rub it in, I promise!, but he could tell how it ended up hurting me.

I most definitely can't run a few yards let alone a whole 5K, but I've wanted to \"do\" a 5K for years. After 2 years of training I can finally walk that distance in about an hour and not be seriously gassed out or hurting. This is a huge wine for me! I can't even describe for you how proud I am that I can do this. My husband is super in shape. With focused training he could easily be an athlete. He decided to just be a weekend athlete, though, so the outdoor sport he plays weekly is more of a hobby for now. Any given Saturday or Sunday, he's clocking in 8-10 miles or more, and while running something like a 5K doesn't appeal to him I know he could run it at an easy going (for him lol!) pace with no real difficulty. A random wine run 5K in a nearby town popped up on my Facebook feed and I just went \"enough with saying 'next year', Scatty. It doesn't have to be perfect. You can do it, so go ahead.\" I signed up and let him know. He took a look at the info and signed himself up too!!! It would be absolutely no problem for this man to jog it in 20-30ish minutes, but instead he wants to walk the hour+ with me for something that holds absolutely no interest for him. My heart absolutely melted. That's love and support.\n\nGo show your love and support for your wife for this 5K, then run another one on your own. It's not just a compromise.

Also-the next 5k will be in June and the weather will most likely be drastically different. Racing in summer sucks. \n\nI say he runs at race pace and smokes them all.", "Look up your local hashing club!", "Because that would be ditching his family to go off on his own.
