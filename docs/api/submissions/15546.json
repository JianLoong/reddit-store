The woman apparently has no filter! Why include someone so obtuse? You don\u2019t know her anything just because you lived in her tummy for 9 months.\n\nGlad she\u2019s giving you the silent treatment. Your life must be much calmer now.", "NTA, if you don't set boundaries now she will do the same to your child.  If it's at all possible to ask her do group therapy with you, I would.  If not or she won't go, then for your mental health you should go low or no contact.  Let the ball be in her court.", "Why do you need to accommodate this awful person?

Congrats!", "No, you had one of the biggest days of your life already, and if tears weren't proof enough she was wrong before, and she's not even remorseful but wants to have yet another opportunity without any regard to her prior offense\u2026? NTA. Besides one was offered by family, and she could be involved in throwing that one and refuses.  It sounds like you\u2019re just now getting your bearings on setting healthy and necessary boundaries with her, as to which your father and stepmom probably have to given that she hates them.", "NTA\n\nConsider her refusal to come as her gift to you for the event.\n\nCongrats on your pregnancy and good luck with the birth. Congrats also on sticking up for yourself against someone who treats you so poorly. It\u2019s bad enough when anyone does it; it\u2019s a special kind of pain when it\u2019s family.", "NTA and do NOT attend the one she's throwing! That will only enable and reward her horrible behavior. This shower is about YOU, not grandma. This is likely an indication of how she'll be when LO is here btw so I would set firm boundaries now.", "NTA. You have made yourself clear about what's appropriate and what isn't. She is choosing to disregard your wishes about your own life.", "Nope, NTA\n\nYour mother actually has no rights or entitlements around your pregnancy. You don\u2019t have to go to her shower for any reason, and it\u2019s made worse by the fact that she knows why you don\u2019t want it. She can have her shower and it will be terribly awkward for all the guests when they realize what\u2019s happening. Your mother is a manipulative person, stick to your boundaries", "NTA. You should absolutely not show up to HER shower. She\u2019s making this about her and not you. Let her be humiliated in front of her church friends when the guest of honor doesn\u2019t show up.", "NTA!!! You\u2019re an adult and are allowed to set boundaries, especially before bringing children into the picture because sounds like she\u2019ll be a nightmare then and not respect your boundaries with your child. I would absolutely do the same", "If you\u2019re trying to avoid humiliation and trying to establish boundaries\u2026 follow through on your initial response to and DON\u2019T ATTEND her shower.  She sounds like a very dominant strong willed woman so a strong response of you not showing up will command more respect from her in the future. \n\nSome people try to out talk you into doing what they want \u2026 say no, warn that you will walk away if they continue. Then change the subject to something benign. If they start again, say goodbye & walk away or hang up the phone.\n\nNow that you have a child on the way\u2026 it would be beneficial for you to establish some hard boundaries with your mom. It will save your sanity. \n\nDr. Henry Cloud has wonderful material regarding boundaries on YouTube. \n\n[Intro to Boundaries by Dr. Henry Cloud](https://youtu.be/zjcPkKHZRCg)\n\nHere are some examples of healthy boundaries. \n\nFamily members:\n\n\u2022 ask permission.\n\n\u2022 take one another\u2019s feelings into consideration.\n\n\u2022 are honest and direct.\n\n\u2022 clearly communicate their wants, needs, and feelings.\n\n\u2022 give each other space.\n\n\u2022 avoid codependent behaviors.\n\n\u2022 show respect for differing perspectives, opinions, and feelings.\n\nHere are some phrases that might help:\n\n\u201cI appreciate your concern, but this is my decision.\u201d \n\n\u201cI respect your opinion, but I don\u2019t share it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will no longer be in the middle of family conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease stop asking/saying/doing _________.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand your frustration, but I am choosing __________.\u201d\n\n\n[What are boundaries?](https://www.livewellwithsharonmartin.com/what-are-boundaries/)\n\n[Setting Healthy Boundaries](https://www.betweensessions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Setting-Healthy-Boundaries-with-Family-Members_ad_040622-1.pdf)", "NTA. *You are taking away my fun as grandma-this is my right.* Um yeah, sure. Her idea of fun is to humiliate you. You shouldn't go to any party she throws for you. It could literally be a sh\\*tshow. Going on her stunt from your wedding. At least you can trust your sister & stepmom to not ambush you with barbed attacks. Your mom? Not so much.", "NTA- now is the time to start asking yourself if you want your baby alone with her. With that in mind, and yourself, start setting boundaries now. Most can be achieved through a simple \"no\", on repeat if necessary.", "NTA. I think you should keep your mouth shut and not warn her that you\u2019re not attending and let her give you the silent treatment for as long as she can tolerate doing it. You\u2019ll be surprised just how good you\u2019ll feel when someone who humiliates and manipulates you is no longer around for a bit.", "NTA, tell her that your stepmom is going to be the kids official grandmother.
