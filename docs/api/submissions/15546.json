Then change the subject to something benign. If they start again, say goodbye & walk away or hang up the phone.\n\nNow that you have a child on the way\u2026 it would be beneficial for you to establish some hard boundaries with your mom. It will save your sanity. \n\nDr. Henry Cloud has wonderful material regarding boundaries on YouTube. \n\n[Intro to Boundaries by Dr. Henry Cloud](https://youtu.be/zjcPkKHZRCg)\n\nHere are some examples of healthy boundaries. \n\nFamily members:\n\n\u2022 ask permission.\n\n\u2022 take one another\u2019s feelings into consideration.\n\n\u2022 are honest and direct.\n\n\u2022 clearly communicate their wants, needs, and feelings.\n\n\u2022 give each other space.\n\n\u2022 avoid codependent behaviors.\n\n\u2022 show respect for differing perspectives, opinions, and feelings.\n\nHere are some phrases that might help:\n\n\u201cI appreciate your concern, but this is my decision.\u201d \n\n\u201cI respect your opinion, but I don\u2019t share it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will no longer be in the middle of family conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease stop asking/saying/doing _________.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand your frustration, but I am choosing __________.\u201d\n\n\n[What are boundaries?](https://www.livewellwithsharonmartin.com/what-are-boundaries/)\n\n[Setting Healthy Boundaries](https://www.betweensessions.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Setting-Healthy-Boundaries-with-Family-Members_ad_040622-1.pdf)", "NTA. *You are taking away my fun as grandma-this is my right.* Um yeah, sure.

Instead of helping you through this, she puts the burden on you (she can't be nice to your step mom for a single after noon, instead you have to go to here). Your mother could easily attend the shower your step mom is throwing and take part in all the grandma activities, but she's chosing not to, because she cant get over her own ego.

If you're mom listen to you when she asked about the party, there would be no issue. If she's embarrassed it's because of a situation she created and your not obligated to attend merely because she failed to cancel. It's not your problem\n\nI have this mom and I feel for you.

They don't enter therapy with the honest intention to change, and B. it just gives them insight into how to further abuse you.", "Exactly this, plus, OP, there is a very common tendency among children who were abused by their parents (and this humiliation is definitely abuse) that they think the abuse happened because of them. There was something wrong with them that made their parents abuse them, and when they see their precious innocent child who is obviously not worthy of abuse, they think that their parents will not abuse their grandchildren.\n\nThis is not about you. This is about your mother. She is someone who humiliates you as abuse. And no matter how precious or innocent or worthy of love your child is, your mother will abuse them in the same way. If you let your mother do this to you in front of your child and to your child, you normalize abuse in loving relationships. When your child grows up and goes out into the world and forms friendships and romantic attachments, they will seek out that abuse, because they think that's what love looks like."]}
