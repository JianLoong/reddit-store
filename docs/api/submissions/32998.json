She initiated the divorce and after a family therapy session, I decided that sign off on the papers because I felt like if I was hindering her happiness, I should let her go so that she could be happy. Even after the divorce we had no hate towards each other and we would occasionally see each other when all our friends gather for a special occasions, but other than that we didn't really see each other much. About 6 months after getting divorce I started dating again and found a women who I loved being around with. \n\nSo today my friends were having a meet up and invited me and girlfriend to come hang out. Keep in mind that my ex is friends with my friends too, so she obviously going to be there. At the meet up I introduced my girlfriend to group of friends and everything went normal as usual. It wasn't until I noticed that my ex looked like she wasn't having fun and acted cold towards me and my girlfriend. I asked her what was wrong but she wouldn't talk to me so I asked one of her girl friends to see what was going on. \n\nHer friend told me that I was an assh0le for moving on so quickly after the divorce and that I should at least waited 2-3 years or discussed it with my ex before starting to date again. I was confused after hearing this and I thought it might be best if we left early.\n\nI'm flabbergasted by what was told to me and I genuinely don't feel like I did anything wrong.

We have been together a long time and have built a great life together.  But please make sure you that you process any residual feelings you had from that marriage.

She has absolutely no right or entitlement to your life at all. She made the choice to extract herself from the right to care or matter. \n\nShe hoped you would be so shattered that you'd think her irreplaceable. That you'd have trouble moving on.

NTA and you might want to cut contact with your ex for a while.", "NTA. There is no timeline when it comes to getting back into the dating pool. Your ex initiated the divorce and can not expect you to put your life on hold for her feelings, nor should you allow that. Most likely, her friend is just being protective of her.\n\nAll that being said, I do not suggest being social with your ex until both of you can be comfortable with each other, regardless of your relationship status (it's possible that might not ever happen). This may be an indicator that you should give her space until she can accept that you are moving on with your life.", "NTA 2-3 years????? Seriously?

The X means no more.", "NTA - in what reality should you have to ask your ex permission to date again?  SHE initiated the divorce, she wanted out of the marriage.

I started dating 9 months after my divorce and 4 years later I\u2019m about to pop the question. At the time my ex was pissed as well but it\u2019s none of her business. I would be hesitant to hang out with your ex incase she goes full psycho and causes you issues with your new partner. \n\nI know my ex went full psycho and wanted to meet my new partner so she knew who our dogs were going to call mummy. We were living in the old rental my ex and I lived in so we ended up having to move house so she no longer knew where we lived. \n\nMy ex still spends plenty of Time with a shrink getting over her complex and her regrets for ending our marriage. I still catch up with my old brother in laws and they tell me this time of year is the worst to be around her and how I dodged a bullet. \n\nGood luck with your new partner.", "She asked for the divorce.

Your ex sounds like a massive arsehole.\n\nThere is no such rule, maybe if she had passed away (God forbid!)", "NTA. \n\nWaiting 2-3 years, asking for permission\u2026that\u2019s stuff that only makes sense if you have kids together as you wouldn\u2019t want the kids to have an unstable life.
