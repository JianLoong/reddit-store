My ex let\u2019s call him Hal, has been a close friend since I was 16 and we\u2019ve always been on and off still remaining close buddies and solid support systems for each other. Over the last year however our lives have gone separate ways with me focusing on university and him being busy with work. So we met up recently for him birthday for a catch up, the night was great and I got to meet his new girlfriend who is a lovely person. I also got to tell him I had started seeing someone new and things where going great, seemed like things were aligning in both of our lives. After the evening we all parted ways and agreed to stay in touch. \n\nQuick side bar- When me and Hal dated it wasn\u2019t a good relationship, I often felt lonely and taken for granted, never being able to refuse his every emotional and personal demands for fear of coming off like I didn\u2019t care about him. I was my first love and best friend and he never showed me any kind of affection, which still gives me issues now with trusting people and personal insecurities . Present day Hal has deeply apologised for everything he did to me all those years ago, saying it\u2019s the worst thing he\u2019s ever done and thinking about hurting me causes him a lot of guilt. I really took to heart what he said as he is still a very important person in my life. Within the same breath he said my kindness \u201cset the standard\u201d for his future relationships.. \n\nAnyway, a month and a half after meeting up for his birthday I get a distressed call from Hal. He tells me he has to leave his flat as his ex partner, not the cute one, has decided on their behalf that they both move out. Hal knows I have a spare room in my apartment and wants to live there for \u201conly a few months\u201d. I immediately bullshit a response saying that I\u2019ll have to think about it.. A month goes by and it\u2019s present day.. Hal is now leaving his flat and tells me that if I don\u2019t let him and his new girlfriend stay in my spare room he\u2019ll essentially be homeless\u2026 I of course can\u2019t let that happen so I say him and his girlfriend can stay for a week and pay the landlord. He agreed but now he\u2019s pushing it saying he needs to stay with me for 3 months.. Which I\u2019m very uncomfortable about. I feel like I\u2019m being a dick for refusing to let him stay but there\u2019s no way I want to come home to my housey house safe space to be greeted my my ex and his gf. I lied and gave him some more bullshit about why he couldn\u2019t stay and he was shocked! I told him it would be weird anyway, with me, my boyfriend, Hal and his new gf all sleeping under the same roof no thanks. My best friend and flat mate is also very pissed about the situation, we both think I\u2019m being taken advantage of again. \n\nEdit: I should also mention that my roommate is also my best friend and she\u2019s Hal\u2019s friend too.. we\u2019re both uncomfortable with the situation but don\u2019t want to be bad friends..\n\nI love my friend Hal but no way is he living with me\u2026.

I always try to overlap tenancies so I have time to move properly.", "He lies to you and he\u2019s not your friend. Friends hold each other up. This parasite only ever pulls you down.", "Yeah definitely I\u2019ve spoken to my landlord, who is a sweetie pie and he\u2019s fine with everything if they pay, I just don\u2019t want to risk our tenant landlord relationship u know", "i mean he\u2019d never do anything besides like emotionally manipulate me and guilt trip me lol", "yeah that is true, definitely don\u2019t like this situation ! aaah!", "yeah it\u2019s shitty, reading all these comments is like damn im actually pretty justified in my response.. sucks knowing someone for so long that continuously pulls this shit after apologising again and again.. silly mee woop", "yeah after reading the comments I really feel like the obligatory friendship support is being pushed too far with him", "I\u2019ll try", "yeah he will..", "From what he told me his ex was lowkey batshit, but tbf he talks a lot of shit about a lot of people so I don\u2019t know what to think. I also spoke to his current gf which is his ex\u2019s ex.. jesus.. weird love triangle shit i can\u2019t keep up.. anyway she also said the ex was crazy and forced him to leave..But he told me a month ago he would be leaving his flat so he had a month to find a new place then the day before leaving his flat he sprung this on me..", "yeah it seems like a situation where he kinda knew how to back me into a corner.. aaaaaa", "sadly that\u2019s true", "You got a great landlord", "I don't like people who emotionally manipulate and guilt trip others. If I am your landlord, I would tell your ex to go fly kite (which means get lost) and stop bothering you. Plus I would stick up pictures of his face all over the neighbourhood to warn others to avoid him like a plague", "No one else wants him, and he just expects you to go back to being his doormat. \n\nYou will be the AH to yourself if you let him live with you.", "You need to remember that actions speak louder than words. If someone apologies and then pulls the same shit, don\u2019t keep finding a reason to excuse it. Even if you hate conflict, it\u2019s better to to set a clear boundary early than to have to make it get to this stage, where you\u2019re actually having to confront. You need to start setting boundaries in your life.", "Ex might be crazy, might not, you never had a chance to decide that for yourself. Hal is probably short on cash, that's why he wants to move in with you guys imo. Also, you don't live alone: your bf and roommate should also have a right to veto.\n\nRemember: he had time to act.", "he\u2019s a cutie patootie", "yeah you\u2019re right also don\u2019t wanna make this my best friend/ current roommates problem as well. Thank you so much :))", "You\u2019re very right ! I really do.. it\u2019s definitely something I need to work on, i really appreciate that everyone is telling me to set these boundaries", "you\u2019re right I shouldn\u2019t assume anything, but yeah. My bf and roommate have known the ins and outs of this entire situation and just think it\u2019s sucky of him to spring this on me. My roommate is also my best friend and she\u2019s known Hal for many years so she understands the dilemma, we\u2019re sharing it as we don\u2019t wanna be shitty friends to Hal but he\u2019s taking advantage of our home and friendship. My bf is comfortable for him to stay, absolutely no issues as he\u2019s met Hal, he just doesn\u2019t like the position Hal\u2019s put me in..", "Glad to help. \n\nJust don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. I did that too much and am working on recovering from burnout.", "Oh it absolutely sucks that he is springing this on you. It would be one thing if they needed a place to crash for a week or two. But 3 months? Like is it legitimately that hard to find a new place to stay where you live? I don't know a lot about housing laws so I would again recommend to be honest with your landlord. Maybe he can give them a temporary lease and you all will know that you are safe and Hal still gets a place to stay. Win-win.", "that\u2019s such good advice thank you! It\u2019s draining yeah, being a yes man can be really shitty sometimes. I hope you\u2019re doing okay with recovering from that! It\u2019s so hard to build friendships with people that pull this kind of emotional manipulation bullshit. It just leaves you exhausted finding people that you can trust again!", "It\u2019s not hard at all.. I think he assumes he can stay rent free.. the nerve !"]}
