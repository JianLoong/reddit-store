As it was getting colder, he asked if he could come up (from 3 hours away) to where I live and stay with me. At first it was just going to be a week or so, then it kind of turned into about a month. It started out okay because he helped around the house (I'm disabled and was hospitalized during the time so he helped with cleaning, cooking, pet care while I was in hospital, etc.) but he started to take advantage of things. He never seemed to be able to pee IN the toilet, no matter how many times I asked and wouldn't wipe up urine splashes, he would leave food out to rot, he actually just plain peed in a container and kept the urine in his room until it stank and I came across it and had to clean it up, he kept eating all my food even after I designated shelves for him in the fridge and pantry and even bought separate food for him. He also took my food stamp card and bought \\~$200 worth of food using my money without permission. During that time, I also probably gave him $500 for bus tickets, food, various necessities, etc. as well as loaning him $1100 for a guitar he \"needed\" so he could go busking - which he never did the whole time he was here.\n\nHe finally left last Wednesday and I thought that I could start cleaning (any suggestions for cleaning urine off of the floor/walls/toilet?!), when my bank statement came and I found out that when he went to pick up a prescription for me when I was super sick, he also went and spent $700 on my debit card! Most of it was on one of those visa gift cards, so it can't be returned and neither can anything on that purchase. The rest was stuff like a computer mouse, energy drinks, a cell phone battery pack, etc. He absolutely did NOT have permission to spend ANY of this and it feels like a complete slap in the face that he would do that in addition to everything I've given him already.\r  \n\r  \nIf I file criminal charges, it would be a felony because it was a debit card (and I'm a protected class since I'm disabled). He's homeless and jobless and I know that a felony would make it hard for him to fine a job and probably housing (as he's trying to get housing assistance). While I'm very angry right now, I don't know if I want to ruin his whole life over what was hopefully a stupid mistake.  But it also feels like he just took more and more advantage of me over the past month and this feels like the last straw - especially because he bought a gift card and not \"needed\" supplies.\r  \n\r  \nWould I be the asshole if I filed criminal charges, even if it would significantly affect his life and future?\r  \n\r  \nPS: I don't know if it makes a difference but he is not in any way claiming responsibility or anything for having done this and is basically denying it/blaming it on PTSD.", "created_utc": 1703006745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m7a1f/wibta_if_i_filed_felony_charges_against_a/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wanted to add that many US states have laws for \u201cfirst offenders\u201d (ie no prior felony conviction, some misdemeanors can also be disqualifying) where the court withholds a felony conviction on someone\u2019s record while they complete certain conditions such as probation, substance abuse treatment, community service, pay restitution back to the victim, etc. So if your \u201cfriend\u201d qualifies for something like this in your state, he may not automatically be a convicted felon. Also, the prosecuting agency should contact you to ask your opinion on the charge(s) and sentencing. If you felt really strongly against a felony, the prosecutor may be able to offer a plea deal to a non-felony charge if your \u201cfriend\u201d is willing to accept the early responsibility and agree to conditions. There tends to be some flexibility in many jurisdictions when it comes to sentencing. Don\u2019t let the idea of a felony hold you back from making your \u201cfriend\u201d accountable. Reporting this now may save many others from being in your position.
