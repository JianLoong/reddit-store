{"id": 33365, "submission_id": "18m7a1f", "title": "WIBTA if I filed felony charges against a homeless friend who stole from me?", "selftext": "A high school friend (36 m) of mine (36 agender) lost his home due to flooding a year ago and ended up living homeless. As it was getting colder, he asked if he could come up (from 3 hours away) to where I live and stay with me. At first it was just going to be a week or so, then it kind of turned into about a month. It started out okay because he helped around the house (I'm disabled and was hospitalized during the time so he helped with cleaning, cooking, pet care while I was in hospital, etc.) but he started to take advantage of things. He never seemed to be able to pee IN the toilet, no matter how many times I asked and wouldn't wipe up urine splashes, he would leave food out to rot, he actually just plain peed in a container and kept the urine in his room until it stank and I came across it and had to clean it up, he kept eating all my food even after I designated shelves for him in the fridge and pantry and even bought separate food for him. He also took my food stamp card and bought \\~$200 worth of food using my money without permission. During that time, I also probably gave him $500 for bus tickets, food, various necessities, etc. as well as loaning him $1100 for a guitar he \"needed\" so he could go busking - which he never did the whole time he was here.\n\nHe finally left last Wednesday and I thought that I could start cleaning (any suggestions for cleaning urine off of the floor/walls/toilet?!), when my bank statement came and I found out that when he went to pick up a prescription for me when I was super sick, he also went and spent $700 on my debit card! Most of it was on one of those visa gift cards, so it can't be returned and neither can anything on that purchase. The rest was stuff like a computer mouse, energy drinks, a cell phone battery pack, etc. He absolutely did NOT have permission to spend ANY of this and it feels like a complete slap in the face that he would do that in addition to everything I've given him already.\r  \n\r  \nIf I file criminal charges, it would be a felony because it was a debit card (and I'm a protected class since I'm disabled). He's homeless and jobless and I know that a felony would make it hard for him to fine a job and probably housing (as he's trying to get housing assistance). While I'm very angry right now, I don't know if I want to ruin his whole life over what was hopefully a stupid mistake.  But it also feels like he just took more and more advantage of me over the past month and this feels like the last straw - especially because he bought a gift card and not \"needed\" supplies.\r  \n\r  \nWould I be the asshole if I filed criminal charges, even if it would significantly affect his life and future?\r  \n\r  \nPS: I don't know if it makes a difference but he is not in any way claiming responsibility or anything for having done this and is basically denying it/blaming it on PTSD.", "created_utc": 1703006745, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18m7a1f/wibta_if_i_filed_felony_charges_against_a/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You voluntarily gave him $1600 already, and I assume if you're a disabled person living in the US, you already have a huge stipulation on how much money you're allowed to have at once, just to continue to receive disability benefits, so $1600 is a **big deal,** especially within a single month.\n\nRegardless of what caused him to become homeless, he's still a liar, a thief, and he doesn't even have the respect to clean up after himself in another person's home.  It even brings to question as to whether he's even telling you the truth about his house getting flooded (it can happen, but this guy has established himself as extremely untrustworthy).  Don't let him get away with taking advantage of you.  He deserves his felony.", "NTA\u2026file those charges asap.  You deserve better.  Actions have consequences.  It is not your fault your \u201cfriend\u201d did what he did.", "NTA if you did.\n\nHe made the choice, he did the crime, he can live with the consequences.  Its not up to you to be his guardian.  You did him a favor, he betrayed your trust, if you let him off the hook he will simply do it again to the next person.\n\nYou can't save someone from themself.", "NTA and I would file it as you need the money.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s really down to a question of whether or not *you* would regret reporting him. It\u2019s not even about him anymore. If you think you\u2019ll feel terrible for a long time about reporting him, you shouldn\u2019t. If you think you can reconcile it to your conscience, then you should. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t blame you if you did. He took advantage of your kindness and stole from you. $700 is a lot of money these days. And anything that happens to him if you reported him is a direct consequence of his actions, not yours. But you shouldn\u2019t have to feel guilty or ashamed that you reported him.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a lose/lose situation. It\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s not your fault.", "NTA\n\nHe's robbed a disabled friend who attempted to do him a good turn. The time when he deserved to be cut a break has passed. Time for appropriate consequences.", "NTA - they took advantage of your kindness and deserves everything coming their way. File charges and let them deal with the consequences of their own actions\n\nI'm sorry this has happened, they sound like an awful person", "Nta. He'll have housing in jail and free  food!", "NTA. File immediately.  Whatever he get convicted with was the result of his own actions and behaviour.", "He knew what he was doing was wrong and a crime.\n\nHe still chose to do it.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA! \n\nYeah, he's homeless, but he took advantage and ***stole*** from you. There's no way around that.", "Are you the DA? How are you going to file charges lol", "NTA\n\nhowever, You will end up paying more for the lawyer and court fees than the 700 missing? It might just be better to chalk it up as a loss and move on. I am sorry this happened to you. I hate thieves.", "Not sure where you are, but in the United States, the government files felony charges, not the individual. IANAL but this is a person you allowed to stay in your home, gave money and support to, and trusted with your debit card. It's doubtful your case would go anywhere, and the legal help you'd need to hire wouldn't get your money back in the end.", "ESH\n\nNo matter what you do, you probably won't be able to recover the lost money. So the only thing you'll get from filing charges is to make trouble for him. \n\nOn the other hand, this *wasn't* \"a stupid mistake\". He went out and took advantage of someone, and if he gets away with it, he'll likely try to do that to someone else again.

Wanted to add that many US states have laws for \u201cfirst offenders\u201d (ie no prior felony conviction, some misdemeanors can also be disqualifying) where the court withholds a felony conviction on someone\u2019s record while they complete certain conditions such as probation, substance abuse treatment, community service, pay restitution back to the victim, etc. So if your \u201cfriend\u201d qualifies for something like this in your state, he may not automatically be a convicted felon. Also, the prosecuting agency should contact you to ask your opinion on the charge(s) and sentencing. If you felt really strongly against a felony, the prosecutor may be able to offer a plea deal to a non-felony charge if your \u201cfriend\u201d is willing to accept the early responsibility and agree to conditions. There tends to be some flexibility in many jurisdictions when it comes to sentencing. Don\u2019t let the idea of a felony hold you back from making your \u201cfriend\u201d accountable. Reporting this now may save many others from being in your position. You can prevent him from victimizing other vulnerable and generous people in the future.", "NTA - by not filing charges you are just enabling his behavior and allowing him to do it to someone else.  You really have no choice if he's at a point in his life that he has to steal, lie and manipulate those who are genuinely trying to help him.", "OP is in no way TA if they choose to press charges.  If anything, this guy could've also gotten access to their Social Security as well.  That's not a thing you want to risk having unchecked.", "I work for a bank investigating debit card disputes. He's liable for the losses in the US too. The cops may not even get involved and consider it a civil matter, as OP willingly gave his debit card to this person."]}
