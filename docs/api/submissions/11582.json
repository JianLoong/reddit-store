It didn't use to be a problem when he was a puppy, but now that he weighs almost 40 pounds it's quite the problem. This past friday they insisted I come over for drinks instead of us meeting at a bar, and when I came through the door their dog came running towards me at full speed and jumped at me while Amy and her bf laughed. I put up my hands on instinct to shield my face and brace myself since I am quite short, and I ended up scratching the dog's eye with my nails. Amy and her boyfriend got really mad at me and had to take their dog to the vet later in the night because he wasn't doing well.\n\nToday I got a text with the vet bill included, and them asking me to pay itfully, which I refused for two reasons: One, the vet bill is nearly the same amount as my rent, and I simply can't afford it without breaking the bank, and two, I've been telling them to train their damn dog for nearly a year now which they haven't done, and it lunges and chews on anything that moves.\n\nOur friends heard of what happened through Amy, and although they haven't scolded me or sent me any direct scathing messages, I can feel that some of them think I am the asshole and that I'm not doing the right thing. As for Amy and her boyfriend, they  think that I am being an irresponsable adult and have made it clear that they themselves cannot afford the surprise expense.

You didnt attack the dog did you?", "NTA and this is coming from someone who has puppies that do the same thing. I am the owner of the dogs, I have a responsibility to train and control my dogs. If this happened to me, I would not ask for anyone to pay a vet bill and it would be MY FAULT for allowing my dog to assault every person that walks in the door. I leash my dogs or put them outside when people come over so this doesn\u2019t happen. What if that dog had knocked you over and you hit your head? There are so many accidents that can happen with a dog that size, both to a human, and the dog itself. As a pet owner, it\u2019s imperative to socialize and train the dog so these things don\u2019t happen. Unfortunate accident, cause is stupid owners that don\u2019t take accountability for their lack of training an animal they\u2019re responsible for. What you did was purely defensive and natural when a freakin STAFFY is running at you full speed. Glad you\u2019re ok and you didn\u2019t get hurt in this.", "NTA. I have a large 80 pound dog, and one of the first things we taught her as a puppy was not to jump on people, because we knew she would grow up to be a big strong dog and that was the best wash to keep anyone from getting hurt. It\u2019s also good manners in general for a dog not to jump all over anyone they meet. Bully breeds have a really bad rap anyway, and a rowdy, out of control one that can hurt people by accident is a tragedy waiting to happen. Especially if she is mouthy! Those dogs have powerful bites, even if they aren\u2019t trying to hurt someone there\u2019s a good chance that can happen and might result in the owners being sued and the dog being put down. They need to get that dog in a training and obedience class asap before anyone else gets hurt! \n\nI read the title thinking it would be something like hitting the dog with your car or feeding it something toxic. This is none of those, and it could have happened at their hands just as easily. The only time someone has ever covered my dog\u2019s vet bill is when their dog got loose and attacked my dog in our own yard, and we didn\u2019t ask or expect them to do that. They are just genuinely sweet people and great neighbors who felt bad about what happened. \nNTA, and you were wise to avoid putting yourself in that situation in the past.", "NTA. Just because what the dog did wasn't a vicious attack, more so excitement, doesnt make what you did any less necessary. Doesnt matter if its the friendliest dog in the world.

Still not your fault.", "As a dog lover, I was prepared to say YTA based on your title, but after reading through the story, I would say you're NTA. I have a 150lb dog, who knows better than to jump on people. It's not so difficult to train a dog to have basic manners. Additionally, if your friends know their dog has this behavior, they could put it in a crate or another room until it calmed down before letting it out to greet people. Your friends are doing a disservice to anyone who comes over to visit, tbh. Plus, they are putting themselves at risk of paying for a hospital visit if their dog injures someone, be it by accident or not. I hope you and your friends can come to a peaceful/respectful resolution, especially since it can be hard for people to see beyond the fact that their pet is hurting.\n\nETA: I just noticed that the dog's owners weren't prepared for the expense for their dog's vet visit. They might do well to consider getting some form of pet insurance for the future if they can. It really helps with unexpected vet visits. Good luck with dealing with this situation!", "Also, wtf did the vet do for the bill to be that high? My dogs total when she got attacked (Sedation, stitches, placement of drains, antibiotics, pain meds) wasn\u2019t that expensive.

Their dog almost hurt you, even if it is only excited and friendly, and if YOU had a hospital/doctor bill from that they would have to pay that AND their vet bill.\n\nI'd be telling them they need to train the dog so next time someone doesn't get hurt and sue them, because at this rate it is going to happen.", "This is what their homeowner/renter's insurance is for. \n\nBut even if they do not have insurance, do not pay a single penny.

Of course. But they have a large vet bill beacuse they let their untrained animal charge someone and it hurt itself doing so. Training and controlling their dog isn't just for their guest's comfort and safety, but for their dogs.

I was even kind when Amy and \\[boyfriend\\] were acting angry at me about a situation that was their own fault, where there animal lunged at me. I understand we love our pets and it sucks to see them hurt. I also know how hard it is for people to admit to themselves when they've messed up, especially when it's hurt someone or something they care about.

It\u2019s just in our nature to naturally flinch or protect ourselves if we are caught by surprise.", "Its tongue in cheek! You've missed it and taken it far too seriously then what was meant.", "When I was around six, a dog twice my size ran me to the ground and started licking me all over my face. I was lucky it was just an over-friendly dog, but I assure you it's not a pleasant experience and I have been uncomfortable with large sized dogs ever since. So yes, I would very well call it an attack.", "It is a fighting breed. In most of Germany for example ownership of a Stafford is heavily restricted and the owners have to fulfill all kinds of requirements and their dog has to pass a character test.\n\nhttps://andsafe.de/magazin/versicherungstipps/was-muss-man-bei-listenhunden-beachten/\n\n>What is a character test?\n\n>A character test can be used to find out how the animal behaves and whether a threat it poses . On the one hand, trained experts examine the general behavior of the dog, on the other hand, they also check the behavior in stressful situations.\n\n>Checked:\n\n    Obedience (doing certain commands)\n    Contact of the animal with the environment (honking cars, crying babies)\n    Contact of the animal to the human (jogger)\n    Contact of the dog with other animals/other dogs\n\n>Listed dogs are generally classified as dangerous based on the breed of the dog. If these animals are tested for signs of the assumed breed-specific increased aggressiveness, owners must repeat these tests with their dog every two years. Exactly which dogs have to take a test differs depending on the federal state. Experts recommend taking the test from the age of 15 months .\n\n>Depending on where you live, you can contact the public order office, the veterinary office or a veterinarian to have a character test carried out.\n\nThese owners would so fail this test.

Ridiculous. \n\nBeing afraid of a butterfly is an irrational fear like being afraid of a harmless spider. It sucks for the one suffering under it, but it is not the same as being afraid of a fighting dog running and jumping at you and trying to \"mouth\" you. The ones not being afraid in this situation lack self preservation instincts.

Excessive fear is excessive fear.", "You know a person can get seriously injured by a giant dog jumping up on them, right?", "If your idea of giant is 40lbs, I hope you never meet an actual giant dog. I\u2019ve never owned a dog that small and have still never owned a giant dog."]}
