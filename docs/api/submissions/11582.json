The only command the dog knows is sit, but the worst thing is that he is mouthy and will jump on people when they come through the door. It didn't use to be a problem when he was a puppy, but now that he weighs almost 40 pounds it's quite the problem. This past friday they insisted I come over for drinks instead of us meeting at a bar, and when I came through the door their dog came running towards me at full speed and jumped at me while Amy and her bf laughed. I put up my hands on instinct to shield my face and brace myself since I am quite short, and I ended up scratching the dog's eye with my nails. Amy and her boyfriend got really mad at me and had to take their dog to the vet later in the night because he wasn't doing well.\n\nToday I got a text with the vet bill included, and them asking me to pay itfully, which I refused for two reasons: One, the vet bill is nearly the same amount as my rent, and I simply can't afford it without breaking the bank, and two, I've been telling them to train their damn dog for nearly a year now which they haven't done, and it lunges and chews on anything that moves.\n\nOur friends heard of what happened through Amy, and although they haven't scolded me or sent me any direct scathing messages, I can feel that some of them think I am the asshole and that I'm not doing the right thing. As for Amy and her boyfriend, they  think that I am being an irresponsable adult and have made it clear that they themselves cannot afford the surprise expense. My roommate also thinks that I should partially help with the bill. AITA ?\n\nEDIT for additional info: the total bill they want me to pay amounts to $1088.", "created_utc": 1678064531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jjqxj/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_friends_vet_bills/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The dog was a danger to you, and you responded by trying to protect yourself. The injury was not intentional and was preventable if they had reasonable care and control of their animal. I feel bad for the dog because the owners have set him up to fail.", "Send them a bill for the trauma of being attacked by a dog.  That price should come out to oh say $1088.  Hey look, you're even!  NTA.", "NTA - You did nothing wrong.  They didn't have their dog under control and it got hurt due to that.  Your ability to pay doesn't matter.  It's their responsibility. You'll pbly lose that friendship though.", "Not your fault. I have two dogs 1 around 60kg and one 25kg Amstaf. It falls on the owner to pay the bill if the dog is not under control. That is completely unreasonable for them to ask that of you. But I probably wouldn't count on them for friendship much either. None of this is on you.", "NTA. They are 100% responsible for the dog getting injured. If they knew the dog jumps at people, they should have put it away when you came over. They thought it was funny at the time and now they don\u2019t want to take responsibility for their carelessness.", "NTA!\nWould they have paid your hospital bill if the dog injured you??", "NTA. You were literally defending yourself. What happened is on them for not training their dog, and thus the bill is on them too.", "NTA.  Dogs should not \"greet\" people by running at them full speed and jumping on people.   They need to train their dog.\n\n\nThey're lucky you weren't hurt.", "NTA! Your move was in self-defense. I wouldn't put it in the same category as, say, accidentally hitting a dog with your car. This sounds pretty minimal. It was the fault of the dog for leaping at you.\n\nYou bear no responsibility. I can't see how your friends think you are \"irresponsible\" by not paying. They're lucky they haven't been sued yet by someone who gets hurt when their dog jumps on them.\n\nNTA.", "NTA \n\nPeople who allow their puppies to do things that when they are grown would not be acceptable are bad dog owners.    This is true *especially*  true when they know the dog is going to be especially strong.   But even with a small dog they can do damage to clothing and skin.\n\nThey *laughed* at you for trying to defend yourself  from their large dog.    When the inevitable happens they want money. \n\nIf you had been knocked over by the dog and broken your arm would they have paid your hospital bill?", "NTA my dog is a wild woman. Also how much did it cost bc our dog scraped her eye once and it wasn\u2019t bank breaking", "NTA\n\nWhat you did would be classified as self-defense. If anything, they would be liable for any injury their dog caused you. They need to train their damn animal. I have a 100 lb. golden who's a pouncer at heart, so I know what goes into that.", "NTA. They are not responsible pet owners if they don't have pet insurance. If they were genuinely responsible owners this should only have been a question of you paying the insurance excess, which I still don't think you should have to do, but it would obviously be a very different conversation.", "NTA. If they won\u2019t train their dog, it\u2019s not your fault if you put your hands up to protect yourself. It\u2019s their responsibility to keep him from jumping on their guests.", "Nta you didnt intentionally hurt the dog and if he didn\u2019t jump up at you nothing would have happened. I think they learnt an expensive lesson that they should have trained their dog", "NTA - I'm glad you weren't hurt", "NTA. I wouldn't pay it at all, I despise irresponsible dog owners.", "NTA. Your friendship is probably over though.", "I would sue them for emotional distress for their dog attacking me.", "NTA. I won\u2019t say they should\u2019ve trained their dog just because I have 2 beagles who defy everything I try to train them - but I could very easily find myself in this situation because of that and I wouldn\u2019t dream of trying to charge anyone else for that.", "NTA. That's all on the owners. They should have trained their dog. It's not like you hurt the dog on purpose.", "NTA. You were protecting yourself. \n\nWhy do you keep going to their house?", "Their house.  Their dog.  It jumped on you.   \n\nIf the injury you caused was truly unintentional, then NTA.    \n\nI would recommend never going to their house again.  If you want to remain friends with them, only meet them in a public place that does not allow dogs.", "NTA and NO DON'T PAY ANY OF THAT VET BILL!!! Animals get hurt and their owners pay for their vet care. You didn't do anything to intentionally injure the dog.", "You are NTA.  You were simply protecting yourself, it is not your fault that the incident occurred.  Since it is not your fault, you are not responsible for the bill.  \n\nYou could characterize this as an accident, but if you wanted to assign blame, it would go to the owners who refuse to restrain and prevent the dog from jumping up on people.  They know it is going to happen and they let it happen.  While it's certainly unexpected that this incident occurred, at the same time they have only themselves to blame.", "NTA. OP point out that YOU were about to get injured by a friendly 40 pound missile. If I were you I'd be pissed I was put into that position. They neither put their dog away nor trained it. Jumping on people is considered very bad dog manners, and just because it's cute as a puppy is no excuse for not taking the responsibility of training it not to.\n\nI wonder if they ever have young children or old people visit. I'm sure the dog is sweet, but it's a liability and they need to take care of that. Show them this thread.", "NTA. I'm sorry, but I misjudged you based on the title alone. I was fully prepared to consider you the AH. But then, I read your post. You did NOT injure their dog intentionally. It was a complete accident that occurred because your friend wouldn't train the damn dog. This is 100% on Amy and her husband. Not only that, but they had the audacity to laugh at you when you were in distress because of their fucking dog. You owe them nothing. They can just consider the vet bill to be the entertainment tax. And really, if YOU had been injured by their dog, you could have sued them and it would have cost them a whole lot more.", "NTA\n\nOP are you all young? They come across as very immature, and those in your life also sound like they're young/pandering. Since you mention you're a student, it's giving \"young group of friends\"--I'd personally cut anyone giving you grief loose, as anyone guilting you is an asshole, just like the dog's owners. Trust me, you can find better friends--and dog owners.", "Fuck that. Lock the dog up in the kitchen with a baby gate when people come over if you can\u2019t control the dog", "Absolutely NTA. Their dog has very poor manners and should have at least basic training. You were defending yourself and the dog owners are completely at fault. A dog jumping on visitors isn\u2019t funny and I\u2019m a little horrified they laughed. I\u2019ve gotten a trainer/behaviorist for all of my dogs (only have one right now). Even personal in-home training is cheaper than that vet bill.", "NTA - their inability to train their dog is not your problem. It\u2019s was an accident caused by their dogs actions not you. Don\u2019t pay\u2026", "NTA, but I don't think that's going to help.", "definitely NTA - but i dont think this reddit thread is going to do a lot to sort out the issue. they think they are in the right, you dont. the end", "You are NTA for refusing to pay the full vet bill. It is not your responsibility to pay for their dog's veterinary expenses, especially when the incident occurred due to their neglect in properly training and controlling their pet. You had to defend yourself against the dog's uncontrolled behavior, and it is not fair for them to expect you to cover the cost of their lack of action.\n\nHowever, you might want to consider offering to pay a portion of the bill as a gesture of goodwill and to maintain the friendship, if you can afford it. This could help ease tensions and show that you are not completely dismissing their concerns. Additionally, you can use this opportunity to reiterate your previous requests for them to train their dog properly and suggest resources or trainers that could help them.\n\nOverall, it's important to communicate calmly and respectfully with your friends and address the root issue of their dog's behavior rather than just the financial aspect.", "NTA.\nDon\u2019t they have pet insurance to deal with these sorts of things??", "NTA they should have trained their dog not to jump up", "NTA. On the off chance they ever invite you over again, decline. You could offer to make payments on half the bill if you\u2019re so inclined,  but I don\u2019t think you owe them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
