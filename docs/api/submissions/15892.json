Also sorry for my grammar, english is not my first language.To start this off, I (47 m) have a 17 year old daughter who will be 18 in 2 days, I will call her Lili for privacy purposes. Lili's quite  independent and has her life put together, she works a part time job to pay her school projects and rarely asks me or my wife money and if she does she would pay it back when she gets paid from her job. I don't remember when she stopped depending on our money but I encourage it since we're struggling financially.My wife, mom, siblings, and relatives have been talking about Lili's 18th birthday and they would like to have a grand celebration for it. 18th birthdays are quite a big deal in my country since it was this \"path to adulthood\" as they say, but I don't believe that, I feel like it's a waste of money for just one day and my daughter has commented that she is satisfied just celebrating at home. But my wife has consulted me about this months before and I have told her no. My mother consulted Lili about her 18th birthday and she has told her that any celebration is fine as long as it's not too much. I thought that was the end of it, but my brothers visited me and talked to me about Lili's debutante party. Everything was settled and paid for by my sister. I was furious and have lashed out to them and told them how they could've just given that money for Lili's college funds instead of this stupid party but they told me how selfish I was for thinking it was all about money and how I should pay more attention to my daughter's feelings and saying that Lili deserves this after all the years she worked hard for herself. I tried to give them my reasoning but they kept berating me, calling me heartless and how a daughter shouldn't feel obligated to support herself when she's barely an adult herself, but Lili's independence and part time job was all her decision, my reasoning is not selfish I am thinking about my daughter and how the money could've been spent on something useful instead of a party that wouldn't even last a day but my brothers are crying and kept telling that I don't get it.Yes I don't get it, I really don't and I want to know what I am missing that a party like this is and if I am an asshole for not wanting this party for my daughter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate:  \nI'm really stupid for asking strangers on the internet for validation when I could've talk to my daughter first and I ashamed that I just realized that just now. I have talked to Lili about the party and her feelings. This is the first time in years since we've talk this long and now I feel like a piece of shit for not noticing any of this sooner.  \nWhen Lili was just a child she was energetic and clingy to me, she was basically a daddy's girl, she always kept me in her thoughts and even tells me everything that goes in her day. But when she reached teen years she has grown distant from me and only has bonded with her mother and younger sister, I always thought it was just the usual phase teens go through and she'll bounce back.  \nI was wrong, it wasn't a phase, it was my fault. Years before I had suffered from severe illness which forced me to quit my job and stay at home, I couldn't provide for my family and in return my mental state change drastically because of the debt and bills piling up. I easily get angry and my issues unfortunately affected my daughter. Lili has mentioned she started becoming independent because she didn't want to feel burdened or feel like she owes me every single penny. She recalled how I would always use the food, the school projects, gifts and money I have given to her as a \"weapon\", in her words \"If I fail a subject, make a mistake, or even just misbehave, you would always tell me how disappointed you are to me and how your sacrifices are all for nothing and how you would threaten to take them away and sell them off\". I never realized those words could affect her this much, I even forgot I told her those words when she was younger. My anger got the best of me and in return I lost my daughter emotionally. I saw her independence as something good instead of being concerned why she doesn't want me to provide for her.   \nI feel so shit, she did want to have a debutante party, she wanted to experience what her female cousins felt during their 18th birthdays with their pretty gowns and fancy cakes. But she just said \"anything is fine\" because she didn't want to look like a spoiled brat in front me and her grandmother. This is the first time I have seen her cry and I am so heartbroken to know that I broke my own daughter and made her feel like she is undeserving of any gifts and celebration, I made her feel like every gift has a payment and now I couldn't stop crying. The guilt I never knew I had started piling up and I just hugged her tightly.  \nNow I know what my brothers were telling me all this time and god I was so stupid for being this dense.   \nThe party will go on, I want my daughter to feel special and I want to atone for all those years where she suffered in silent because of me. I will attend the party and apologize to my siblings for lashing out.", "created_utc": 1682671003, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131lsvz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_celebrate_my_daughters/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The real question is, why are you so determined not to let your 18-year-old daughter have a party that you don\u2019t have to pay for? As she and the rest of your family, happy, and it won\u2019t impinge on you, why on earth would you stand in their way? Do you try and take candy off babies too?", "YTA\n\nLet me see if i got this right:\n\n- sometime during her childhood you stopped being your minor child's provider for many things that you were obligated by law - \"all the years she worked hard for herself\" \n\n- after seeing that you don't want to provide for her she started working so she can buy her things (that you refused to) \n\n- she knows she cannot rely on you at all so she lowered her expectations for a birthday party (i wonder how many times she missed one)\n\n- your wife, mother, siblings all want to throw her a party and you refuse\n\n- your sister already planned and paid for her party and you refuse to let your still minor child to attend\n\nYou are selfish.\n\nI wonder how much rent is she paying and how much money she spends on the bills/groceries.\n\nYou only see $$$$ whenever you look at her.\n\nEdit to correct", "Oh, boy, here we go.\n\n>Lili's quite independent and has her life put together, she works a part time job to pay her school projects and rarely asks me or my wife money and if she does she would pay it back when she gets paid from her job\n\nSo, you neglected her, she learned early on she can't rely on you. You know that early independence is actually BAD, right? It's a sign of poor parenting.\n\n>I don't remember when she stopped depending on our money but I encourage it since we're struggling financially.\n\nWhen you decided to have a child, you took on an obligation. The financial obligation, at minimum, is for eighteen years. Not sixteen years. Not seventeen years. Eighteen years. Financial struggles or no.\n\n>18th birthdays are quite a big deal in my country since it was this \"path to adulthood\" as they say, but I don't believe that, I feel like it's a waste of money for just one day\n\nLet me guess. *You* didn't get one?\n\n>my daughter has commented that she is satisfied just celebrating at home\n\nI'll take another guess and say you haven't been quiet in your disapproval of the eighteenth birthdays, and your daughter is trying to protect her feelings by saying this. If she says she is satisfied with a home celebration, she can't be disappointed when you let her down.\n\n>But my wife has consulted me about this months before and I have told her no.\n\nOh? Who the fuck died and made you king?\n\n>My mother consulted Lili about her 18th birthday and she has told her that any celebration is fine as long as it's not too much.\n\nOh yes, daughter is *definitely* trying not to get her hopes up, knowing you will disappoint her.\n\n>I thought that was the end of it, but my brothers visited me and talked to me about Lili's debutante party.

It's not all about money. Do you even *like* your daughter?\n\n>I tried to give them my reasoning but they kept berating me, calling me heartless and how a daughter shouldn't feel obligated to support herself when she's barely an adult herself, but Lili's independence and part time job was all her decision, my reasoning is not selfish I am thinking about my daughter and how the money could've been spent on something useful instead of a party that wouldn't even last a day\n\nYOUR DAUGHTER SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD TO SUPPORT HERSELF! SHE SUPPORTED HERSELF BECAUSE YOU DID NOT CARE FOR HER!\n\nAGAIN: DO YOU EVEN LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER?\n\nI agree with your siblings' assessment.

You are selfish as f.", "Literally the only opinion that matters here is lili's.\n\nYTA for making her party all about yourself and not listening to what she wants. If it turns out the party was too much, then the rest of your family are assholes for the same reason.", "YTA\n\nYes money is important, but your daughter will only turn 18 once and it\u2019s a big step in adulthood in many cultures, your daughter will remember how all her family came together to celebrate her and she will treasure the memories \n\nIt\u2019s great that your daughter is independent and almost definitely will do well, but your scourge views of counting pennies is going to grow to resentment", "Yep, YTA. her independence might have been her decision, which you heavily encouraged as you are financially struggling. It sounds like she could either focus on her own finances or struggle with you, which isn't much of a choice and more of a necessity.\n\nIf relatives want to pay for a party for her, you get absolutely zero say in it. You don't decide how they spend their money, you don't get to decide whether your daughter will like it or not. It's her decision, she's independent from you. You are an asshole for deciding you don't want your daughter to be celebrated. Probably best you stick a big fake smile on, go to the party and pretend you want to celebrate your daughter too.", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter sees that you're poor and is doing what she can to not be a burden.

Don't you want to see that smile when she walks into the party?   \n\nDude, no one is obligated to throw the party or pay for your daughter's college, or whatever.  So just look at your sister paying for the party as one thing you don't have to stress about and be thankful", "YTA. It's your daughter's birthday party that was paid for by family to give her a nice memory she can have for the rest of her life and you are complaining and basically ruining it for her.", "YTA\n\n\nIt honestly sounds like you don't love your daughter and this for quiet some time. \n\n\n\nAnd that you told your wife is an irk too. Why do you have the power over everything?", "I really have a hard time believing some of these stories.

In 3 hours.", "YTA for making this all about you - you don\u2019t want her to have a birthday party so no one gets to give her that. \n\nYou are really selfish. It\u2019s not that she doesn\u2019t want a party, it\u2019s that she\u2019s learned to be disappointed in you and is scared of your reactions.", "Your daughter is just saying she\u2019s satisfied with just celebrating at home because she knows you can\u2019t/won\u2019t spend a lot on her birthday anyway. \n\nAlso, being \u201csatisfied\u201d is not the same as being excited and happy.\n\nIt\u2019s not your money that\u2019s being spent. Would you even give your daughter the money if your sister handed you a check for Lili\u2019s 18th? Why would you feel entitled to the difference in money that is spent on a less lavish party? It\u2019s important to your sister to give your daughter something you won\u2019t even host on your own. So she\u2019s stepping up.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.

Memories for life for your daughter. A sign that she is loved and appreciated which all of her family want to show her except for you.", "YTA. Please don\u2019t go to the party and spoil it for her. She deserves a day to celebrate her.", ">Yes I don't get it, I really don't\n\nLet me help: You don't get to demand that someone's generous gift - to someone ELSE - be used for a different thing.

I didn\u2019t get a sweet 16 or a big 18 blowout. I didn\u2019t go out on my 21st. But that was all MY choice. My parents put money aside for them just in case I changed my mind.
