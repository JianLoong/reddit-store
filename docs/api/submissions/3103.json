My sister Skye (18f) was put in charge of organizing it because she is the only one of the kids still living at my moms' house. \n\nSkye decided this would be a family and close friends celebration (friends we've all been close to for several years), so she made a group chat with everyone on Facebook messenger to share the details. Two days after the invites are put out and I confirmed I was going, Skye messaged me to tell me she has also invited her friend and my other sister, Claire's (18f) roommate, Chad. \n\nI don't want to go into too many details, but 2 years ago Chad and I dated. During that time he was extremely abusive, and left me hospitalized with severe PTSD. Hearing his voice or seeing a picture of him is pretty triggering, let alone spending a day with him. \n\nI called my mom and asked her if Skye had made sure it was okay with her if she invited Chad, because she doesn't like him either. She actually told Skye that Chad wasn't invited when she let Skye set up the event. My mom talked to Skye again and reminded her that the holidays are for the family. \n\nThe next day I decided to talk with Skye in person to ask her if she was willing to uninvite Chad. She flat out said it wasn't something she would even consider doing. Chad is an important part of her life and she's not going to exclude him from important events. She said that if I don't want to show up that's on me. We ended the conversation with me verifying that if he was going to be there, I'm not. \n\nSkye accepted this and isn't upset. Claire on the other hand, is PISSED. \n\nShe yelled at my for 15 minutes today telling me how I should just suck it up and go, and that me not going just proves that I'm selfish. She went on about how I never sacrificed anything for my family, I don't act like I love my family, and I never think of anyone but myself. I tried to explain that a big part of my recovery is not being around him, and she said it was stupid of me to hold onto a grudge for so long.\n\nMy dad has said he is disappointed in me for not prioritizing my family. He also told me I should go because I shouldn't try to hurt my family just be my sister invited someone I have a grudge against. \n\nMy stepmom (moms wife) said I was just being dramatic and need to get over myself. \n\nMy mom actually understands and doesn't blame me. She knows I'm doing what I need to do to take care of myself and she actually is upset with Skye for inviting Chad. \n\nI feel very strongly about my position, but with the feedback I'm getting I'm not positive I'm doing the right thing.

Mental health is sooo important. Juat ignore it, have a great holiday for yourself and know you are doing right. Abuse is nothing to joke over. Live your life and don't let this make you feel bad.

Her advice was to not only draw that clear boundary as you did with your sister, but when other family try to pressure you to go along with this harebrained idea, to respond that no, you will not be attending, and it's really weird that your family would want you to have to trigger yourself like that, and would choose to welcome an abuser over their own family member. And then just keep pushing that point. \"Can't you be polite?\" \"No, I cannot be polite to the person who put me in the hospital, and I find it a little weird that you all can\" etc, etc. And you will be NTA for any of it. Don't be afraid to make them uncomfortable, they deserve to be.", "NTA.

Everyone else is and I'll try and be brief and if you feel the need to, rub it in their faces because this sure af isn't a grude. HE ABUSED YOU. You have a more than valid reason to not want him there and in the case of your sister digging her heels in not attending\n\n\\-Your sister for not only inviting Chad but putting his abusive ass before you, her blood family\n\n\\-Your mother for not putting her foot down given Christmas is presumably being held in HER home. She herself doesn't want him around and specifically said he wasn't invited but is letting your sister overrule her? No offense but wtf is wrong with your mother?\n\n\\-Claire, I can't say what I want to say but she needs to get over herself.\n\n\\-Your father and Stepmother, again I really can't say what I want to say but f them both. Again this isn't a grude and screw putting family first when it comes to sharing space with someone who abused you.\n\nI'm sorry your family as a whole sucks op. Go spend Christmas where you are loved and respected.", "NTA NTA NTA a million times.\n\nYour family is toxic and clearly do not respect you - do what you have to for your mental health. Do not get pressured.\n\nThey are not acting like family, your mom is the only sane, caring person- ignore the rest them", "NTA they are literally prioritizing this dude", "NTA. \n  \nPoint out that _they_ are the ones not prioritizing family, not you.  \n  \nEdit:\nHad to come back and add that your family's behavior is sickening.  \n  \nYou do what you need to do for yourself. I'm glad at least you're already out of there.", "NTA and for all the people saying you should prioritize family, ask them why they won\u2019t do the same thing? Having Chad there, a non family member, being more important than you means THEY are not prioritizing family, not you.\n\nThey want you to spend the day with your abuser.  That is an outright NO and if they can\u2019t accept that, then it\u2019s time to distance yourself from these people who will not support you.\n\nGoing LC with family is hard, but it\u2019s harder to be expected to suck up your own feelings for others all the time.  Go live your life, be happy and surround yourself with people who support you.  Sounds like your mom is the only one who has your back here.  Make it clear that you are very disappointed in THEIR choices of a friend over you and then cut contact.", "NTA but frankly I'd cut everyone who says \"hey it's fine he HOSPITALIZED you\" out of your life Permanently.  These people have declared that they believe your health is a lower priority then not looking bad.  Be done with them, find real family.  People who Love, Care about, and Respect you.", "NTA\n\nYour family is giving you plenty of reason to prioritize your mental health, rather than them. If you look at it that way, Chad is just the cherry bomb on a shit sundae. \n\nDon't go to the family get-together. Invite your mom out for lunch or coffee on a day that works for the two of you, and don't invite the rest of the family.", "NTA. I like how you have worked through this and are dealing. I am sorry that you now have to deal with a family that has no compassion or support for you. \u201cSelfish\u201d is a trap word that guilts you if you don\u2019t throw yourself under the bus for the welfare of the others. It\u2019s not reciprocal, either. Their language is abuse, and you are better off at home.", "Funny how it's 'think of the family---suck it up'' but they aren't thinking of you?\n\nNTA\n\nThere is no scenario that forces you to a holiday with an abusive ex, for any reason.", "Whose house is it? Your mom's? Then SHE can say who can and can't come. If she says Chad is unwelcome, then buhbye!\n\nNTA\n\nDo what's best for you. If it means missing out then so be it. Let your family know that they are jerks for not understanding and putting a virtual stranger above their own family.", "nta.  you could go the petty route.  go to dinner and spend all the time telling all the abusive things he did and how much it hurt you.  just keep telling story after story.  talk about it all thru dinner.", "NTA op. And aside from your mom, your family are the ones behaving like they don\u2019t love you. Keep yourself 8n a safe space and don\u2019t attend their event.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Everyone else except your mother is a massive turd sandwich that was consumed by a rabid skunk and then regurgitated into the gutter.", "NTA this takes no stretch of the imagination to figure that. What the fuck is wrong with your family? Holy shit.", "INFO b/c I genuinely cannot understand this:\n\nThis person's treatment of you landed you in the hospital...but out of your whole family, only your mom understands why you'd want to be away from him? Everyone else is willing to drop you, their child/sibling, in favor of him (and your sister is still roommates with him?)\n\n...um...what?! Yeah, I definitely don't understand this. How the f#@& is that where they're landing on this? I legit don't get it.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m really sorry that not only does your family not support you, but they\u2019re actually setting you up to face your abuser.\n\nYou are 100% doing the right thing. It\u2019s bad enough that Claire\u2019s living with him. Inviting him to Christmas? Prioritising his attendance over yours?\n\nI\u2019d be going no contact with Skye, Claire, your father and your stepmom. And possibly your mom - she says she understands but the event\u2019s at her house, yes? She should have final say over who attends, so needs to put her foot down.\n\nInvite your mom to Christmas with you instead. She shouldn\u2019t stand for this, so her response should tell you where she sits on the matter.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m so, so sorry that not only are you in this position, but that they\u2019ve got you doubting yourself so much that you posted here.", "NTA", "NTA, honestly it sounds like you need to fully cut her out of your life. The fact that she's saying you're abuser is more important to her than you, is her telling you, you don't matter to her. You don't need someone who tells you you don't matter in your life. Fuck your dad as well, this isn't a grudge, this is you protecting yourself from people who are wronging you", "Chad is just gaslighting your whole family. Stay low  contact with the or no contact with your sisters. They suck and don\u2019t support you at all. Really, you\u2019re family isn\u2019t putting family first by ignoring you. Stay away from them. \n\nGather friends who don\u2019t have anywhere to go and invite them to a hotel for thanksgiving dinner. Many hotels have a buffet and it\u2019s better to spend it with friends and there\u2019s not clean up.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is an AH, along with the rest of the family. If she supposedly understands, why is she not reigning in your sister? She should have put her foot down from the start because its her house (I'm assuming Skye is not the homeowner).", "NTA. It's not a grudge, it's trauma. You don't get over trauma ny hanging out with your abuser... and his enablers. \n\nI am so sorry your family doesn't have your back on this. I think it's disgusting any of them would agree to be in the same room with him, let alone have him as a roommate. \n\nHonestly, I would cut all of them off. I get that this might not be what you want to do. But regardless, I think it's important to keep saying to them that as long as they keep prioritizing your abuser over you, you won't be coming around. They want you to sweep it under the rug. That's cruel of them and so unsupportive it blows my mind. \n\nHere's to your continued healing, and I hope you build some loving and supportive friendships so you'll get the kindness and understanding that you deserve from your family but aren't receiving.", "NTA. Your families are monsters. They invite someone you hospitalised you and tell you to stop being dramatic? Your sister is next level evil. Do you have someone to spend Christmas with?", "NTA \n\n\"I will not be attending any functions where my abuser is present for my health and safety. If you would rather prioritize friends over family that is your choice. This is a non negotiable boundary for my safety and healing. I wish you the best.\"\n\nThen I personally would go LC/NC while you continue healing. You deserve so much better", "NTA. Your sister has prioritized Chad over you. How mean of her. Looks like a deliberate move on her part. You must go or threaten to go NC with her and everyone who are asking you to minimize the trauma.", "NTA. Be incredibly explicit in your denials. \"I won't be at Christmas because Claire and skye are choosing my abuser over their own sister. \" make it clear who's ACTUALLY not prioritizing family. If you're petty, make a post on SM to the same effect... sickening behavior from the people siding with Chad", "**I don't want to go into too many details, but 2 years ago Chad and I dated. During that time he was extremely abusive, and left me hospitalized with severe PTSD. Hearing his voice or seeing a picture of him is pretty triggering, let alone spending a day with him.**\n\nNTA  You would be the AH to yourself if you put yourself into the same room with this man.\n\nI don't understand your family's minimizing your past trauma but you know what you know.  Do the safe and healthy thing.", "So very NTA. What the fuck is wrong with your family (Mum excluded)?", "NTA... Not even remotely. Wtf is wrong with your family and that idiot girl???", "They do know. they calim he's changed and isn't like that anymore. but he also managed to convince them that I was the one who was treating him poorly, so I don't know how that adds up.", "Or your gifts. If you bought any? Return them all and donate the cash to a women's shelter.", "Right like are we missing something? I can\u2019t genuinely understand how only a singular family member understands that OP shouldn\u2019t be in the same room as this guy and even that person hasn\u2019t rescinded the invite. Wth is going on with these people?", "Right? And OP should 'just get over it'? THEY'RE the ones thinking of themselves first, and not the well-being of their own family. Selfish hypocrites. \n\nOP, NTA. Do what is best and right for you and your mental well-being, not what your family demands you do. Except for your mom, who sounds awesome. Maybe you and your mom can do something together at a different time to celebrate the holiday. Best of luck. And I'm sorry the rest of your family  doesn't respect your wishes.", "Pretty soon you'll be able to see what is wrong on the medical charts. They'll have to learn a very painful lesson...but I can't work up a lot of sympathy for them at this point. I just hope one of them presses charges.", "They say he's changed and he's not like that anymore. They understand (to a certain degree) that I don't want to be around him. They think I should be over it by now.", "AKA they were never abused by him, they like him better than you. Honestly don't make the mistake that I made, if someone is telling you that they are picking your abuser over you, drop them", "Why a woman's shelter? op is m, donate to a cause for battered men?", "Abusers are charming. He\u2019ll abuse Claire or Skype next and they will just let him.", "If OP can find one, sure! Unfortunately they're hard to find but it's a lot easier to find one for women. Then again, that's another argument for donating to a men's  shelter!", "SKYPE", "First it's skype, then it will be Messenger next he abuses. Fear the Snapchat steps he will take."]}
