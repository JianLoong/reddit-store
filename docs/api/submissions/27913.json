What a weird interaction!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNONE of his business.", "NTA- unless he is an employee or shareholder, it is literally not his business.", "Unless he's your business partner or accountant your finances have bugger all to do with him.", "I don't understand why that would matter to him. Does it have something to do with negotiating a price for what you sell now?\n\nRegardless, you're not an AH here. I suspect others are right and he was pumping you for information so he can compete in some way. Either that or he wants to try to sell you something and is looking for data to base his offer on.\n\nI was in a bookstore browsing once and a guy I've never met walked up to me and tried to get me interested in a multi-level marketing thing but wasn't really all that willing to explain much. I finally had enough and told him I wasn't interested.\n\nHe stormed off too for pretty much the same reason. I wasn't fitting the script he had in his mind about how things were supposed to go and got bent out of shape because of it. It was just ... strange.", "NTA. This sounds like he was gearing up for a sales pitch or an MLM invitation.", "Absolutely NTA. It\u2019s not any of his business. The End.", "NTA - A business's financial information is not public, unless it's a publicly traded company. A number of years ago, I was the front desk manager for a major hotel in the town I live in. A guy and some friends comes in, and he's showing them around the lobby. He brings them up to the front desk  and starts asking me questions about occupancy rate, room rates, rev par (revenue per room), etc. I tell him that that information won't be given out by me. He puffs up and tells me that he and his family used to own the hotel - I tell him, great, but I'm still not giving you the current information. Feel free to call the current owner and manager. Discretion is part of the job, too - NTA.", "NTA. Why does he need to know??? \ud83d\udc40", "NTA he really should have minded his business what does he have to do with your sales have to do with and you how about not letting him be a customer anymore because he was really rude", "NTA. This is literally \u201cnot your business.\u201d If he wants to see the books, he should buy in.", "NTA \n\nSounds to me like he threw a fit because he can't handle not getting exactly what he wants when he demands it.  You're under no obligation to tell the public anything about your business and he's a weirdo for demanding it and throwing a temper tantrum when it wasn't forthcoming.", "NTA\n\nBut at least in Finland this information about companies is public. Not the profits but the amount of revenue, amount of workers, company debt etc.\n\nAlso, weirdly, also the income of individuals is public. You can get them by going to the tax office. If you're interested in their salary they've paid themselves.\n\nYou shouldn't need to disclose these to strangers especially if the records are not public in your country.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's never mattered why they're being told 'no' just that they are being told 'no.'  He more than likely thought he could ask and OP HAD to tell him because he's a customer.  That's why he muttered the 2023 comment.  I've seen this so often it's hilarious.\n\nNTA,  It is YOUR business OP.  He's just some yahoo who needs his 'tude adjusted massively.
