I don't treat them badly, just indifferently. I also don't like to be bothered, since once I was studying (I do medicine) and the little girl bothered me.

I agree, but I don't see them as family and it is not my obligation to take care of them. In addition to being too annoying and rude. He offered me money to take care of them or spend a few days with them, an offer that I rejected.\n\nI told him I would not spend another summer with him if he did not do something about his children.

Nor you can be forced to feel anything for your half siblings or as you prefer his other children. That said it\u2019s indeed not their fault so I don\u2019t know what you mean with \u2018do something with his children\u2019. Not force you to babysit them? Absolutely. Ship them away while you visit? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. \nIf you and your sister economic situation allow you to buy your own place and ask him to visit you there alone. That is indeed a possibility. Or could be a vacation with him alone if you still wish to have a relationship with him.", "NTA- do what makes you happy. You don\u2019t have to be forced into any kind of relationship. This is his mess, he needs to clean it up and take care of it.", "NTA\n\nI don't know what your age is, but you sound like a teenager or early 20s. I don't blame you for not recognizing these kids as a family. Family can literally be anyone because there is no strict definition of it. As you said, \"I would like him to understand that his new children are the result of my mother's suffering...\" The fact that your father is struggling to empathize with your reality is worrisome.", "NTA. You don't have to have a relationship with them if you don't want to, HOWEVER don't misdirect the blame for your father's affair onto his children. They're innocent of that.\n\nIf you stay with your father you'll have to accept that these children are your relatives whether you like it or not. If you can't accept that then don't stay with him. The examples you gave of the girl acting up are pretty benign - your intolerance of them really just stems from the affair. Reserve judgement of their character and if they're worth your dislike until they become adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get why you dislike you Dad and his new family but he can\u2019t just get rid of his young children. I don\u2019t blame you for not babysitting but if you want to see your Dad you will see his other kids. If you don\u2019t want to see you Dad fair enough.", "You're NTA for feeling this way about the situation, but YTA for not treating the kids as kids. They have been told you're family and will treat you as such, so it's on you to be better around the kids. That doesn't mean that you have to spend extra time with them, but it does mean when you interact with them that they're not the target of your angst.\n\nYour father has wronged you badly, and it is natural to then apply those feelings around him, but applying feelings to blameless kids, that's where you become the AH.\n\nI'd avoid too much contact, particularlywith your Dad, but in these situations just try and accept the kids as family, because that's how they see you. Even if they are annoying, they're kids. Take the high road. \n\nI do hope it all works out OP, these situations are messy and take down more people than the perpetrators realise.", "Esh, I get that the easiest way to hurt your dad is by disassociating yourself from your half siblings. Still sucks and I can't help but think it is going to negatively affect you mentally and emotionally at some point. You would probably be better off just telling dear old dad to sit down and let you berate him for all the pain and suffering you guys suffered and then have him let you pop him a few times for the anger release. I mean, sounds better than taking it out on little kids", "YTA. What exactly is he supposed to \u201cdo about his children\u201d? Stop visiting if you don\u2019t want to be around them. Your father is the one who wronged you and your mother. You\u2019re mad at the wrong people.", "ESH. Your dad sucked to begin with but that is far from the kids\u2019 faults. It seems like you can\u2019t find it in yourself to forgive him, and you don\u2019t have to! However, the thing I take most issue with is the last paragraph. What do you mean \u201cif he did not do something about his children\u201d? What do you want him to do? Don\u2019t give him this ultimatum between you and his other kids. It\u2019s also really weird to refer to your half siblings as your \u201cfather\u2019s sons\u201d if you\u2019re referring to one of them as she", "I have 18 years old.
