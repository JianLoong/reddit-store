I don't blame you for not recognizing these kids as a family. Family can literally be anyone because there is no strict definition of it. As you said, \"I would like him to understand that his new children are the result of my mother's suffering...\" The fact that your father is struggling to empathize with your reality is worrisome.", "NTA. You don't have to have a relationship with them if you don't want to, HOWEVER don't misdirect the blame for your father's affair onto his children. They're innocent of that.\n\nIf you stay with your father you'll have to accept that these children are your relatives whether you like it or not. If you can't accept that then don't stay with him. The examples you gave of the girl acting up are pretty benign - your intolerance of them really just stems from the affair. Reserve judgement of their character and if they're worth your dislike until they become adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get why you dislike you Dad and his new family but he can\u2019t just get rid of his young children. I don\u2019t blame you for not babysitting but if you want to see your Dad you will see his other kids. If you don\u2019t want to see you Dad fair enough.", "You're NTA for feeling this way about the situation, but YTA for not treating the kids as kids. They have been told you're family and will treat you as such, so it's on you to be better around the kids. That doesn't mean that you have to spend extra time with them, but it does mean when you interact with them that they're not the target of your angst.\n\nYour father has wronged you badly, and it is natural to then apply those feelings around him, but applying feelings to blameless kids, that's where you become the AH.\n\nI'd avoid too much contact, particularlywith your Dad, but in these situations just try and accept the kids as family, because that's how they see you. Even if they are annoying, they're kids. Take the high road. \n\nI do hope it all works out OP, these situations are messy and take down more people than the perpetrators realise.", "Esh, I get that the easiest way to hurt your dad is by disassociating yourself from your half siblings. Still sucks and I can't help but think it is going to negatively affect you mentally and emotionally at some point. You would probably be better off just telling dear old dad to sit down and let you berate him for all the pain and suffering you guys suffered and then have him let you pop him a few times for the anger release. I mean, sounds better than taking it out on little kids", "YTA. What exactly is he supposed to \u201cdo about his children\u201d? Stop visiting if you don\u2019t want to be around them. Your father is the one who wronged you and your mother. You\u2019re mad at the wrong people.", "ESH. Your dad sucked to begin with but that is far from the kids\u2019 faults. It seems like you can\u2019t find it in yourself to forgive him, and you don\u2019t have to! However, the thing I take most issue with is the last paragraph. What do you mean \u201cif he did not do something about his children\u201d? What do you want him to do? Don\u2019t give him this ultimatum between you and his other kids. It\u2019s also really weird to refer to your half siblings as your \u201cfather\u2019s sons\u201d if you\u2019re referring to one of them as she", "I have 18 years old. I'm just saying it so everyone knows, I see that by putting my age many things become clear.", "Well, you are 18. Your half siblings are small children. Do you honestly expect him to ship them off somewhere else when you visit??? For that ultimatum YTA. I don't understand. My father did that to my mother. Got a girl only a few yrs older than me pregnant when I was 14. She was 18. I did not like her. I still loved my father and when that baby was born, I loved him like a brother, because he was my brother. Maybe I was just raised better. Relationships fall apart and it is very hard to not see the pain of the wronged parent and not want to retaliate, but I knew my father loved me. I was angry at him for a long time, but he was still my Dad and I loved him. My mother, who I stayed with, would have kicked my ass if I disrespected my father or took my anger out on my half siblings. She raised me better than to do that. Loving your father and loving your half siblings isn't a betrayal of your mother. My mother believed that us kids maintaining live and respect for our father and loving our half siblings, honored her by being the decent people she raised us to be. If you can't be around your half siblings without being cruel to then and indifference is cruel, then stay away. Just like you and your mother deserved better, so do they. You could not stop your father from hurting your family...that is on him. But you sure as hell can keep yourself from hurting those innocent children....that is on YOU!", "They broke your stuff? And your father needs to be forced to buy new ones? Sounds spoiled to me.. He should be scolding them for breaking those. NTA.", ">That said it\u2019s indeed not their fault so I don\u2019t know what you mean with \u2018do something with his children\u2019. Not force you to babysit them? Absolutely. Ship them away while you visit? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. \n\nCould be about fixing their shitty behaviour considering daddy's little monster destroyed OP's airpods for telling her to leave them alone. I wouldn't want to stay with the menace either unless OP's dad fixed their behaviour.", "NTA - the fact your father cannot understand where you are coming from is concerning. Do you have to visit him? Do you enjoy the relationship with him? If not, you are not forced to have a relationship with him and his new family. If you are getting nothing but pain from the relationship cut contact with him. \n\nAnd it is never your job to baby sit someone else\u2019s child. They sound unruly and spoiled children too. You are right, you have one sister and your dad has other kids. Keep working on your schooling and the relationship with your sister and mom but if it\u2019s unhealthy with your dad, it is ok to say, I need time and space so I will not be visiting for awhile. You are not required to put yourself in that position again. You owe him and those kids nothing!", "I think you\u2019re going to regret how you treated them when you\u2019re older. They\u2019re just little kids.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI see that you said you're 18. Fortunately for you, you no longer have to visit your father since it sounds like you don't care for any of the four people living in that home.\n\nWhen you're older and you want to go to Spain...stay at a hotel.", "NTA", "Yeah you are kind of punishing them if you\u2019re keeping in contact with your father, still as family by the sounds of it, but not them. \n\nIf you cut contact with your father and never saw any of them again, then they wouldn\u2019t be family.", "[deleted]", "NTA  just remember that the kids dont hsve any choice in this either and they will probably have shitty times with your dad too as they get older and realize he kinda sucks. Its deff different for everyone but you guys could get along well later in life. You're still young and trying to be your own person and find yourself and kids bugging you will only make you resent them but maybe later when they are their own people you could hang out and talk shit about your dad together", "Why bother spending time at all with this guy?", "NTA  - he started a new family with persumably a younger woman and you feel he was 'upgrading'.  You all moved to Canada which didn't make it easy for you to build a relationship when he could attempt to fix\n\nYou arn't helping anybody holding onto this anger , not that you're entitled to.", "What is he supposed to do about his children? LOL", "I\u2019m gonna go out on a lonely limb here and say ESH\u2026 It would have been you in the clear until you tried to make your dad get rid of his other children (presumably from the place where they live year round) so you (and your sister?) can stay the summer? D*ck move. You aren\u2019t entitled to that space, and your dad made his choice. It sucks, but you have to deal with it.\n\nYour dad sucks, for sure. But his other children (your half siblings) share none of that blame. Stop putting your beef with their sperm-donor onto them. THEY. ARE. CHILDREN. Stop treating them like shit in *their* home. Just shut the damn door if you don\u2019t want to be bothered.", "YTA The children aren't to blame. You should try to get to know them. They are your half siblings.", "NTA.. he can\u2019t both eat the cake and keep it too..", "NTA", "NTA someone whose been in your exact position I get how you feel. My dad whored around with multiple women, having multiple children, so believe me I get it. That being said, while I wouldnt want to be around them either, not just because theyre young and annoying, Id put the blame squarely on your father. I mean what kind of relationship does he really think youll have with them if its forced? Young kids are annoying and break things, that's nothing new. Put the blame where it belongs, and if you cant be around *him* without blaming *them* you might want to take some space from him.", "NTA, your father created those circumstances without thinking how it would impact you and your siblings the moment he committed infidelity.", "Actually the father is responsible for their suffering. Not the children. \nSeems OP blames the wrong people here.", "NTA.", "This is clearly already not popular, but YTA.\n\nShe's a fucking child.  Not only that, but it seems like *you* are visiting *him.* You say he stayed in  Spain and your family moved to Canada. You are a legal adult. So how are you all in a place together?\n\nYou go across the ocean to live with your dad or visit him again and while there you treat a little girl shittily? You are absolutely the asshole here. \n\nYou wanna be an ass to your dad, whatever.  But she's a kid.  Grow the fuck up and act your age.", "NTA\n\n Your dad is lucky you even talk to him anymore...", "Stay away. Yes the kids are not at fault, but they are a result of his cheating!", "NTA 100%", "F*ck, and I say this with extreme prejudice, them kids. Not your spawn, not your problem. And make sure your father knows that. They can bother the people that spat them from their loins, you're 18, you literally don't have to if you don't want to. NTA", ">while there you treat a little girl shittily?\n\nShe just told her to go search for dad and stop messing up her stuff. Everyone would've done the same. The kid broke her airpods too", ">You should try to get to know them.\n\nWhy?? \n\n>They are your half siblings.\n\nThey're the kids her dad had with the women he left the family for.", "She's not abusing his kids. She doesn't have any responsability with them and it's not obligated to mantain any relantionship.", "You\u2019re not necessarily wrong, but I\u2019m personally willing to excuse an upset and betrayed teenager for behaving like a betrayed and upset teenager.", "She acted like a little sister would.  And if OP wants to live in that house the least they can do is not be an ass to a kid that they are actually related to.\n\nIf OP has such a big problem with their siblings, then stay out of their dad's place.", "Yeah and op acted like an older sister would by telling her to get out. \n\n So she shouldn't have a relationship with her dad just because she doesn't like his new family?? Let the girl's mom explain to her why her halfsiblings don't like her. When you have kids with the man whose marriage you ruined, you should be prepared to tell that to your kids one day. Her dad's affair kids aren't op's problem. Also, op literally said she wants to rent a house with sister so that she won't have to put up with those spoiled kids."]}
