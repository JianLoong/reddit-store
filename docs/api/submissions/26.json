A lot of them are older than me (28) and are at the point that they have kids like the person whose house we were. They are somewhere in their 50's I don't know the exact age but they have a few kids the youngest of which was like 8 or 9 and was at the party. \n\nThe kid is just bored and trying to do something, his dad mentions that I might play some of the same games he does and yeah sure enough we both play smash brothers. Kids asks if I want to play a game and I'm bored so I agree.\n\nThis is where I totally wipe the floor with the kid. Like no contest at all. He trys several different game modes and rules to try and get a win in and he takes the l every time. After a few losses he's getting visibly frustrated, his teenaged sibling tries to keep him calm to no avail. I just keep letting the kid play me as long as he wanted to, i wasnt particularly egging him on or anything either i would usually just ask if he wanted to go again.\n\nEventually the kid has a mini tantrum and his dad has to stop what he's doing to scold him and send him to bed. It was a little awkward for everyone.\n\nNo one ever directly put blame on me for it but I could kinda tell from the vibe in the room that they low key blamed me for the outburst as well. And there were lots of small Comments saying things like I was a little harsh or asking why I couldn't just let him win one, or why I didn't stop playing with him after he started getting mad. I just told them I was having fun and left it at that.\n\nI'll admit to not being the best read on social situations but I feel like none of the blame should be put on me at all. I don't feel particularly obligated to go easy on him just because he's a kid. I'm not like a go to tournaments smash player but I'm at least decent at it and I didn't hold back at all when playing him.

That's the responsibility of the people who have skin in the game of making him a functioning adult.\n\nIt's good to get your ass kicked at things every once in a while. Especially something low-stakes, like video games.  It keeps you humble.", "NTA. It's not because he is a kid that you need to cheat and let him win. He lost and that's that. Kid or not, if the skill level is different, I would opt for team battles rather than 1v1 versus. But you have no obligation to let a kid win, just because he is a kid.", "NTA. my family never let my sibling or i win at games when we were younger. if he wants to throw a tantrum that\u2019s a reflection on the parents in my opinion", "NAH, I play my 5 year old nephew in chess and at first I beat him every game. now he's much better and  when he beats me he is even more satisfied because he earned the win.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA.\n\nMy son turned 5 in July. Playing SSB is a thing he and my husband do, and have done since last Christmas (when we got the Switch).\n\nSon used to tantrum every damn time he lost and then husband would be like \u201cok, that\u2019s it then\u201d. Eventually, son learned that tantruming would end the game.\n\nThen, he would start practicing without Daddy. And I\u2019m talking hundreds of hours at this point.\n\nAnd now, I think he\u2019s only beaten my husband once or twice (and my husband is actually really good, he flogs anyone he plays 90% of the time) but he takes the losses really well now, and is now just fixated on getting good enough to beat Daddy.\n\nI didn\u2019t like that my husband wouldn\u2019t ever let him win. But, he was right. It\u2019s helped my son with his resilience, and taught him that you have to earn your win.\n\nWhich, sounds silly, it\u2019s a fighting game on an acid trip (don\u2019t even try to tell me otherwise), but it\u2019s been a great tool for instilling these concepts into him at such a young age, where there\u2019s no lecture, he\u2019s having fun along the way and when he loses and daddy only has 2 lives left instead of 3, it\u2019s a huge accomplishment.\n\n\u201cJust let him win\u201d is the cause of the issue, not him losing.", "NTA. Ultimately, kids need to learn to lose and 8+ is a good time to learn that not everyone is going to take it easy on you during games and those with more practice (ie, more years) are going to be better at some things. \n\nWith that said, it's the general social norm that you take it easy on kids when you're playing games, especially games you're definitely going to be significantly better at.", "\"After a few losses he's getting visibly frustrated, his teenaged sibling tries to keep him calm to no avail. I just keep letting the kid play me as long as he wanted to, i wasnt particularly egging him on or anything either i would usually just ask if he wanted to go again.\"\n\nThis has nothing to do with you not reading social cues. You got the message - the child was getting upset. Anyone with experience with children would know to give it a rest, but you clearly don't have any. Let me make it plain - when playing with a child that is not yours, the moment they show distress you cease and desist. Period. It doesn't matter if it is mid-game, if you are having fun, etc. You just stop. It would be a nice thing to do to attempt to smooth things with the child and show them that they are safe and secure, but if you don't know how to do that either then I suggest you excuse yourself with something irrefutable, for example 'oh gosh, I have a bathroom emergency. I have to go. Sorry buddy.'\n\nSo from the perspective of the youth and the parent, yes, Y W B T A. From your own lack of experience and cluelessness with children and parent situations, no, NTA. It is time you learn some basic social skills around children, and you would be wise to apologize for being TA now that you have been educated.", "NTA. He didn't earn the win, parents need to teach him sportsmanship. I never threw a game for my kid, it makes the victory even sweeter when she earned it", "NTA. Not your problem to stoke a kids ego, that\u2019s what his parents are for", "NTA. Letting him win would have been fine, seems like a lot of commenters on this sub would have done it. It's not something I would have thought to do, though. Learning how to lose is an important skill, which clearly this kid still needs to learn. I come from a family that doesn't let the kids win just cause they're kids, and we all end up being pretty good at games from a young age because of it. And we all have fun whether we're winning or losing.", "YTA\n\nIf you play baseball with kids. Do you throw your hardest pitch?\n\nIf you play football. Do you blitz children and tackle them?\n\nNo, you take it easy on them. Even better. You use the opportunity to teach them something. Instead of just pawning the kid. Tell them what you are doing and how they can get out of it. Then you do the attack for them to respond to.\n\nHonestly, even if it wasn't a kid. Just blitzing someone at a game is no fun. If someone obviously can't compete on my level. I give them pointers. So, they get better and can provide some competition. They feel better and I have someone better to play against. Plus, having no real competition can make you sloppy.\n\nYou aren't obligated to teach them or do any of this. But it's how a non AH interacts with children.", "I'm going with ESH.  The kid for being 9 and throwing a tantrum for losing. Toddlers do that. But OP, you were at a party with co-workers. Why would you keep letting the kid get frustrated enough to throw a fit? I do agree that kids need to learn how to lose, this is not your nephew or cousin or family friend's kid.  Its a co-workers kid and now you're facing work drama, which you could have easily avoided.", "NTA\nFeels a little like the solution of shuffling off entertaining you and the small child backfired. His parents should have been checking in and stopped it if it was getting to be too much for him. You weren't dissing him or anything. It's a hard lesson to learn that sometimes you're just not good enough yet, but it's an important one. It's not your job to suck so he can falsely shine.", "NTA and never mind all the people voting the other way. \"Letting someone win\" is actually degrading the child and not taking him seriously as a person. Children are people too, and they have to learn that you cannot win every time.", "Read the room. You weren\u2019t at a tournament, you were at the kid\u2019s house. How would that have felt to you as a kid? You didn\u2019t have to let him win every game, but perhaps share your knowledge with him. Show him moves he didn\u2019t know, or share your strategies. That way it\u2019s much more fun for him, and it\u2019s more interactive. You\u2019re sharing something instead of it just being a competition. Or if you didn\u2019t want to interact with the kid, don\u2019t play. \n\nYTA. Especially for saying \u201cI just said I was having fun.\u201d No one cares if you had fun, if the kid is leaving in tears. You made it seem like you took joy from beating him again and again.", "I N F O: do you not know how to do team battles or use a damage handicap? I don\u2019t just let my brother win, but in a 1v1 I always use a handicap so he has a chance. And even if you could win with a 300% handicap, you were playing with a kid, so you should probably throw him a victory or two anyways. YTA.", "YTA- even puppies know to let the weak ones win one every now and then. At the very least you could have had the maturity to stop playing once things started going South. I would find very little joy in continually beating a child at a game.", "NTA This reminds me of a quote from the movie What Dreams May Come when Chris is teaching his daughter how to play chess\n\nMarie: - I haven't won yet.\n\nChris: - It's your first time.\n\nMarie: - No, I like that I haven't won yet. Means you're not cheating. And when I win, I win. I just want to play 'til I do. Unless you want to stop.\n\nChris: - No. Let's play 'til you win.", "I always take it easy on children.

I realize I'm probably in the minority here. I", "NAH but It's a work social thing... I think the cordial thing would to let the kid win once or twice to show you're not petty/competitive by outside appearance/perception. I don't think you are at all.

I don't you or the kid is an AH but your coworkers may be.", "YTA \u2014 was it really so fun to continually wipe the floor with a kid 20 years younger than yourself? Until he was so frustrated he exploded and the whole party got weird?\n\nYou should have offered some pointers, helped him practice recognizing opportunities to counter, given him some chances to get better. Not \u201clet him win,\u201d but help him improve. And if that was too much effort YOU should have gracefully moved on or switched games/modes when you saw him getting upset.", "NTA, simply because if the kid wanted to beat you he should just play more or get better it\u2019s really not that serious", "YTA - beating him once or twice, fine. But you kept at it and knew the kid was getting upset. You purposely humiliated him. \n\nYou\u2019re an adult now, act like it.", "YTA - He's 9. I get beating him once or twice and the people saying \"kid lost, he needs to suck it up\" but you couldn't let him win just once or just politely say you were done after he started to get mad? Like, was your ego stroked enough for beating a little kid multiple times?

Because if you behaved like this in a friendly match with someone who *does* go to smash tournaments I assure you they would give you shit for it. Flexing on an eight year old at a party like you got a title on the line? Why? What does that accomplish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let me tell you what I would have done as someone who *does* go to tournaments for this very game and has a kid he wants to teach to be a humble loser. I would have beat him, obviously. But I would have adjusted my play style to be inline or just above his level. I am not going to edge guard or hit-stun cancel against a little kid, at least not like I would against someone who knows what's what.   \n\n\nAnd after I beat him my next words wouldn't be \"go again?\" but instead \"that move I did there at the end, do you want to know how to counter that?\" You know why? Because I actually want people to have fun, improve, and learn that failure (losing) is the first step to getting better. Where you see a kid getting \"visibly frustrated\" and think \"lol, loser get owned\" good players, and people, see an opportunity to grow the community and have some fun.\n\nSo yeah, Y T A.", "NTA", "The kid's a bit sensitive, and could be a spoiled brat. The dad could have asked you if you're good at the game, and kept an eye on his kid's mood.\nLearning to lose is an essential in life. You taught the kid well.", "YTA because as an adult you should've stopped playing against him when he got upset. You have no obligation to let him win but after a point you should've suggested taking a break. Of course the kid is gonna say he wants to keep playing. Kids are notorious for bad judgement and continuing to throw themselves at brick walls. His tantrum certainly isn't excusable, but it's a little mean spirited to keep wiping the floor with him.", "YTA.  If the kid is visibly upset enough that his brother tried to keep him calm, anyone should know enough to stop playing", "YTA\n\nThe whole point of playing with a kid is that you do go gentle on them! Especially when you see that that\u2019s g they\u2019re getting upset.", "Sight YTA because come on, you couldn't read the room and let the kid just win one game?

When playing with young kids you don\u2019t play at your full, adult skill level; you tone it down so they can have fun too.

That is just cruel.", "ESH The parents asked you to play a game with their kiddo while you bored, which is a little odd to me, given the social situation. You just played the game like normal.

You might win the occasional game to make it seem real, but you don't ever, ever pull the sort of crap you just did. Not even with an adult and a pick-me-up game; you don't just absolutely humiliate someone for NO GOOD REASON.  You really dropped the ball on this one.

While the kid obviously isn't \"correct\" and a parent or mentor shouldn't encourage outbursts like that when they happen, it is not unexpected by any means.\n\nPart of maturing as an individual yourself means recognizing where others stand in that journey and treating them accordingly. Being an adult means recognizing that children of that age will react poorly to repeated public humiliations without any productive feedback, and managing the situation by turning it into a learning experience or some kind of softer landing.\n\nWhile the kid's outburst is not the \"right\" reaction to losing in a game, there is a perfectly reasonable expectation for someone your age to handle the situation differently.

I just told them I was having fun and left it at that.\n\nI'll admit to not being the best read on social situations but I feel like none of the blame should be put on me at all. I don't feel particularly obligated to go easy on him just because he's a kid. I'm not like a go to tournaments smash player but I'm at least decent at it and I didn't hold back at all when playing him. Which I didn't see an issue with but reading the room afterwards it seems like maybe I should have. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

No matter the size of your opponent...](https://images.app.goo.gl/YfNgYgkpsCGZwbeb6)", "NTA. You can't always win. You can't always get what you want. That kid needs to learn that. You are not obligated to go easy on him. He is not entitled to a free win in a game.\n\nI used to play Super Smash Bros with my younger cousins when I was younger, Melee and later Brawl and Wii U. I don't play competitive. I'm quite good at For Glory on the Wii U, where you play against random strangers online, but not amazing. A win rate of 64%. I always play as Kirby.\n\nOne of my cousins was very arrogant and cocky. He kept saying how good he was at the game. So I played one game with him and wiped the floor with him. Doing that over and over and over again would not really be fun, so I decided to use one of my favourite tricks, Kirbycide. If you don't know what that is, watch the first minute of this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMx3P1FvUIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMx3P1FvUIA). I beat him with Kirbycide a few times to see if he would learn from that. I was willing to explain what I did and teach him how to avoid Kirbycide if he did not get the hint on his own after a few losses.\n\nBasically, an opponent should easily see Kirbycide coming. If you battle Kirby near the edge of a stage, you know this might happen. But my cousin kept falling for it. After four matches, I tried to explain to him that he should not go anywhere near a swallowing Kirby near a ledge and offered him to try again. However, he kept making the same mistake over and over again and threw a tantrum when he lost several times in a row.\n\nYears later, my uncle thanked me for not letting his son win and teaching him that you can't always win. It was difficult for my cousin at first, but he actually got better at the game. After beating weak in-game CPU opponents, he thought he was the man, so he was not used to losing. The losses actually motivated him to practice against stronger CPU opponents, so he actually got better at the game. When he was older, he once admitted that he was glad I didn't lose on purpose.\n\nShort term, this sucks for the kid. In the long run, he might learn from this. He might learn that losing is part of life. And maybe this might motivate him to actually practice more often and get better at the game.", "NTA", "NTA- once I realised my nephews and nieces didn\u2019t know how to loose well I made it a point to teach them not only to be gracious winners but have great gamesmanship when they don\u2019t win so they\u2019re not complete ah when things don\u2019t go their way\u2026 you taught him a valuable lesson every child should learn.

Wiping the floor with a kid sounds pretty boring anyways, once it was clear he was starting to get frustrated, I think you should have stopped playing or just let him think he was winning (or at least doing better, god). I'm not going to call a kid a sore loser when you were wiping the floor with him-- nobody likes playing a game where they don't even stand a chance and the other player is good enough to stop them from getting a chance to do anything. There's a difference between someone getting frustrated at a better player who keeps winning jn good matches verses someone who wails on them the whole time.\n\nOften, adults can get frustrated playing a game where they're outclassed-- my husband and I don't often play with each other for that very reason, unless we start a game at the same time. He doesn't enjoy coming in as a n00b on the games I'm already good at and vise-versa, because we don't stand a chance against each other. When we're closer in skill, we play together because even if the same person is the winner 90% of the time, if the match is closer it's funner for both of us. \n\nIf you're having a hard time understanding this: would you run at full speed when playing duck duck goose with kindergarteners? Slam dunk every throw qnd hold the ball over your head when playing hoops with kids on a plastic net that goes to your chin? Play the optimal tic tak to strategy over and over with a four year old whose certain his best move is the middle? Rip off the blanket hiding a giggling child immediately when playing hide and seek instead of looking around the room and dramatically and pretending you had to try? If you don't want to play a game with the \"adult humouring the child\" handicap, then don't play with children. You don't have to let them win, just let them think it's a fair game where they have a chance.\n\nTo use the \"holding the ball over your head\" metaphor-- it's okay to hold the ball just out of reach, so if they just jump high enough they could get it. It's more fun for everyone that way. If you're just going to hold the ball over your head where they can't get it, of course they're going to get as much fun out of it as if theh weren't playing at all, or less because of the frustration.", "YTA, you could\u2019ve let me win once /s\n\nI grew up getting my ass handed to me in games, which now as a result has disabled any mercy I may have had before\n\nEdit: NTA is the actual answer", "Yeah obviously the kid was the asshole in this situation but that\u2019s cause he\u2019s 9 and you\u2019re a grown ass man.

Lots and lots of stress. Over protect your child now, and you will get to watch them pay the price later. The way to minimise stress is preparation not protection.", "Same here! I liked the little pie shapes. I don\u2019t remember ever being fussed about losing but I did get some help from the peanut gallery from time to time to keep me included. My sisters were more competitive in general and still are. I don\u2019t know, winning has never been a big deal for me. When I was little, I was just happy to be there.", "Yes, we had the 80s one too! When I could occasionally answer one question I was so proud\ud83d\ude04", "True I don\u2019t think he was trying to teach some life lessons", "There's a difference between winning with grace, letting the kid get some hits in, and just repeatedly smearing the kid - I get the impression this was the latter.", "Yeah, that's pretty good parental timing. Honestly seeing you mention the time, he was probably getting cranky more because he was already up too late than because you were trouncing him, which is why he was just scolded and sent to bed. You were fine. Don't be surprised if he asks for a rematch if you see him again.", "Going easy doesn't mean letting the kid win. OP makes it sound like he fucking blitzed the kid, which would frustrate anyone to experience game after game. There's a difference between losing with dignity and being expected to, when zero chance, can't even get some hits in, not get frustrated. OP could have played a little gentler so the kid could get some hits in and feel like he had a chance.", "Didn\u2019t say the adult had to purposefully lose. But you can play games, even Smash Brothers, in a way that is more interactive and fun for two players of different skill sets.", "Do you not understand social expectations of kids and adults?\n\nDo you not understand that I never said go easy on the kid, I said show him moves and tricks and make it more interactive, less based on who wins or losses?", ">Should he have gone easy on me?\n\nSince you've never played before, then yes, I'm thinking he should ideally have gone easy on you. From what I'm seeing, you did not challenge him yourself, you didn't trash talk, it was not a competitive match. He can go all-in once to show you he's good, then switch to bad characters/play with handicap/etc to keep games interesting", "I mercilessly destroyed my coworkers kids in smash. No ragrats.", "You kept playing.  You're at a party, and you chose to keep playing with a 9 year old as he gets more and more upset.  \n\nYou started playing as a favor to the kid because he was bored, but now instead of helping to entertain him, you are starting to torment him.  \n\nAt that point, what are you doing?  Walk away, grab a beer, talk to another adult", "I am attempting to establish my credentials as someone who is knowledgeable on fighting game etiquette to establish that I wasn't talking out my ass.", "Flexing doesn't mean getting sweaty it means showing off. Your normal casual level was still showing off as it was so far past his. Again, the proper thing to do would have been to adjust your playstyle so that you were still winning but not decimating the kid.  \n\n\nIt is bad form to absolutely shit all over someone in **any** sport which is why many sports have Mercy Rules (like the Ten Run Rule in baseball leagues). These rules are almost always in place when dealing with children and sometimes even in place when dealing with **adults**.", "I'd guess though that you're used to some shit? \ud83d\ude09 But I get your point. I think some people just enjoy playing the game, regardless of winning. For others winning is an essential part of the fun. Maybe it's got more to do with character than with learning to lose. I'm a sore loser too, but I try and force myself to suck it up. It's an interesting challenge.", "I mean, unless your ego is really pumped by beating  child at a video game, why not?", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Kids shouldn\u2019t be coddled with adults letting them win at every game.", "Am I serious? Yes.  Kid learned a valuable lesson.  Losing isn't fun.  So whose playing for fun?  The kid that had a meltdown because they got trounced or the 28 yo man who kicked a kids booty in a kids game?\n\nI'd say OP had more fun and is NTA.", "As long as you weren't deliberately letting his little heart swell with hope to turn around and calliously rip his dreams apart, then I'll stick with NTA. \ud83d\ude02", "Sorry for assuming. Then i am not sure if you are or not, had to be there to know. But it probably would have been safer to let go of the game when the kid started to get angsty.", "So you got him so frustrated that he got punished by his father in front of all of those guests. Must feel real good, because of course, none of this is your fault.", "I guess leading by example is not your thing.", "You don't let them win every time.\n\nBut swiping the floor with a kid every single game is simply a dick move, period.\n\nKids at that age don't play to win like most adult gamers you will meet on reddit do, they play for fun and not with a overly competitive mindset.", "Remind me to play Boggle against you sometime. When you have 15 words and I have 95, by about the 20th game, how do you think you're gonna feel? And you are an ADULT. But sure, I'll happily humiliate you at it, no problem.", "Now you've had some time to reflect, why do you think you kept playing while the child was becoming increasing upset? Did you feel somehow trapped? Unsure of how to escape/the kid's reaction if you stopped? Anxious to go back to the party? Were you curious to see what would happen?    \nWe pay for our lessons. We've all been the AH in some situation. Did you learn anything? No point letting a good learning experience go to waste.", "Good one", "This is how I am with my kid in mario cart. My eldest and I can truly compete for first, but my ND 8 year old is lucky to get like 8th place. When I play with her, I make sure not to get first.

Lol", "[deleted]", "No rugrats*", "No regerts!!!", "Lol you must be a joy at parties.", "The point of video games is to have fun. If you don't enjoy it even when you lose you're doing it wrong, especially in co op. That feeling when I almost win is great. That feeling when I get trounced usually makes me laugh. My spouse seems to dislike losing but the high when they eventually win is enough to cancel it out for them. Damn, I love video games.", "Again punished is a stretch. Kid got told to go to bed. It was already 10 or so prob his bed time anyway.", "Yeah I guess I'm not very good at it considering he didn't take the hint I was giving him", "Trapped is a good word. Like idk what to do there kid wanted to keep going like he'd be annoyed if I said I didn't want to.", "That reminds me of being about 16 and coming home from my part-time job to find my family (as usual) watching University Challenge, which is the most fiendishly difficult quiz show ever. As I came in there was an obscure question about classic cars. My dad was a huge car buff, and when I immediately piped up with the right answer his face was priceless, because I'm pretty clueless.\nHe kept asking me how the hell I knew, and I just smiled like a smug asshole. Didn't ever tell him I happened to read it in a trashy 1970s novel about devil worshippers\ud83e\udd23. Still one of the finest moments of my youth!", "If your perspective was a competitive match, then yes, in that case, he should have not gone easy on you. That is up to you. If you enjoy it this way, no need to ask that question then :)\n\nBut no, smash doesn't have to be necessarily played competitively. I've seen it played as a party game, and I've seen it played competitively.\n\nIt's not the game that is competive, it is your mindset that makes it so, or your opponent's. You can make most games competitive, and you can make most of them casual too.", "No regrets*", "I do not go to parties.

I play video games to assert dominance over newbs.", "When stuff like this happens you have to just get help. Next time, recruit an adult who understands children to help. Casually call them over and and engage them briefly in conversation before disengaging from the game, they will assist if the kid gets annoying, you won't even need to ask, they'll help if they're present.  \nOf course you can do whatever you want but getting help is a solid plan for almost every problem.", "Awesome! \ud83d\ude02", "[deleted]", "Nothing wrong with that, the selflessness is admirable and heroic.", "I'm not the god of video games to tell you what's important and what's silly.  \nMaybe they'll show up later.  \nIn case this was not entirely a joke, you assert zero dominance over someone by beating them in a video game. It has no meaning whatsoever. I genuinely hope you have some real sources of self worth. You're as important as everyone else.", "Are you stating that such a thing is not possible? Or are you really asking how it can be the case? \n\nIf it's the former, all good, I'm not going to try and convince you.

Rinse and repeat. It\u2019s fun for everyone and the kid gets something out of it.", "This might be a controversial take on this one but did no one else have a parent/guardian/someone to play with that absolutely would never *let* them win? No, just me? My dad literally never let me win a game against him unless I won fair and square, ever, so maybe I'm biased for this one but NTA. Its just a videogame and throwing a tantrum over it sounds ridiculous but he's only 9 and needs to be taught better by his parents than to get tantrum level upset over a game.", "YTA\n\nNot for beating the kid, but when you noticed he was getting upset, you should have put the controller down and gone to hang out with the grownups.", "GET GUD", "Ive been spending time with my 9 yo cousin recently and we have been playing mario kart. He has not son a single race against me so far and I thought about letting him win but nah.\nI know what a bad winner he is. Like full on dancing and telling you how much you suck for half an hour winner.\nI'm trying to get him to be nicer (when playing carts) but I don't wanna deal with his mocking knowing full well I just let him win.\nBesides it's so damn hard, he sucks at mk XD\n\nNTA", "NTA - maybe I\u2019ve just been a gamer (video, board, puzzles, crosswords, you name it) for too long, but losing on purpose so a kid can win teaches them nothing.

If anything, it was really kind of you to play games with someone\u2019s kid at a party when you likely came to hang out with the adults.\n\nETA - I\u2019m not insinuating the kid is TA with my verdict. I think all the adults that low-key shunned you for existing honestly and avoided a teaching moment are TAs.", "NTA. Everyone loses some stuff some times.\nI mean, if you wanted him to have a great time playing with you, or if you wanted to bond with, or become great friends with this kid you might\u2019ve given him some pointers and let him try them out but ultimately copping a loss that feels bad but doesn\u2019t actually hurt your health or wellbeing can be character building.", "But that\u2019s a disingenuous comparison\u2026 by all rights a 9yo COULD be as good as a 28yo when it comes to video games. The same is (obviously) not true for the two sports you mentioned.", "Why was it not going to be a fair match just because of the ages?\n\nAt 8 years old I was playing cards and boardgame with my parents, and I was able to win without help.\n\n(Where is the satisfaction in being allowed to win?
