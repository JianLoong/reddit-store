And why in the world can't 2 babies be celebrated together.", "NTA and I spot hints that one of you is the golden child here. If they didn't at least tell you that your sister had an announcement to make you couldn't have known that it would have been the wrong time to announce your pregnancy.\n\nIn addition your mothers outburst is way off target as it is much easier to harm the child early in the pregnancy than later on and your sister started yelling, so you just answered the same way.", "NTA \n\nYou did not know her plans. You had news to share at a family dinner, so you did. \n\nSo your sister can yell at you but you are not allowed to yell back? In what other ways do your parents favor your sister? Have you read up on Golden child/scapegoat? That's what sounds like is going on. And guess what? That will extend to your child. Her children will always be treated better than yours. It's up to you to protect them, or let them deal with it.", "So the moral of the story is that nobody cares that there is a second baby and there is only one Queen and her child is the only prince / princess ?\n\nDid they even noticed what you said and did they contragualted you for being pregnant ? like what the heck \n\nInstead of being happy that you both become moms and can share the struggle of I assume being first time moms together she wants to be the only one with a baby ?", "NTA. Your sister attacked first. Your sister\u2019s attack was dramatic and immature. It is odd that your family is asking you to take responsibility for your sister\u2019s bad behavior.", "NTA. The world does not revolve around your sister", "I'm cuirous how she would have reacted if you were the first pregnant . would you get all the attenion or is she really the goldchild .\n\nwould they be as excited about your pregancy as they are about hers or would they push you asside and give her the queen satues even though you were first ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow often do you guys have dinner together ? Anyway there should be room for both babies . Is your family normally like that ?", "NTA honestly, I would go as far as to exclude all of the family for the next 9 months. Hard core, no contact. \nOnly associate with your friends and your husband's family. Your family doesn't deserve to be around during this time, and congratulations!", "NTA-but it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. If your sister yelled first, your mother\u2019s reaction either screams of favoritism or a hearing problem. Also, I\u2019m confused about the continued response. Weeks later they are still upset with you-over just that small bit of yelling match? I really think there is a LOT more to the history here. \n\nFundamentally, you can\u2019t be the AH for not reading your sister\u2019s mind. That\u2019s idiocy.\n\nMay I mention that you\u2019ll get a lot farther with your family if you skip the yelling stage when your sister yells. When she yells at you, you simply push your chair out and leave the room or the house. That\u2019s it. With that move, you\u2019ve dismantled the entire situation in your favor.", "I saw above that you didn\u2019t know she was going to reveal the gender, so I\u2019m going to go with NTA. Pretty princess didn\u2019t want to share the limelight.", "INFO: so *was* the purpose of that dinner for her to announce her baby\u2019s gender?", "You both are too old to be pulling this shit.  NTA for yelling back, but everyone handled this wrong.", "Hey, fam, let's keep it real here. Yelling at a pregnant sister is a major no-go, but we all make mistakes.

Yelling is absolutely bad for the baby. So baby and I will be distancing ourselves from family drama. We\u2019ll probably let you know when the baby is born.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "Well Y T A for getting pregnant just to copy and spite your sister and take her spotlight /s\n\nCLEARLY NTA, not only did she yell at you first, she completely overshadowed your announcement! A normal person would be happy that their child would have a cousin so close in age. She could have just announced it anyway after you said your news. I didn\u2019t know there was a limit on how many people can share exciting news at a family dinner? And your mother enabling this behavior\u2026we know who\u2019s going to be the favorite grandchild as well", "Nta you didn't know she was going to make an announcement. She also yelled at you so she deserves to be yelled at. Also yes yelling can be stressful but if someone doesn't have the coping skills and get so stressed that it's dangerous to the baby to be yelled at for a few minutes how the heck do they except to parent that child. Honestly you family is the asshole for clearly favouring your sister.", "Maybe because sister is the golden child, given by how mom jumped to rescue baby sister in distress yet yelling at OP, the same reason she was accusing OP of.\n\nSister obviously sounds a self-centred person, probably because of mommy's coddling \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nNTA OP. You have nothing to apologize for and be the \"bigger person\". Block all the flying monkeys.", "No it was just a family gathering we had no idea she was sharing her news she never told me. if she did i would have waited with my news .", "Defo need clarification on this, did you know the dinner was for a gender reveal? If so I\u2019d be tempted to say you MBTA and that you should have waited and let her have her moment, but if you didn\u2019t know then you\u2019re NTA it was just really unlucky timing", "So her pregnant sister can scream at her, but she cannot screqm back even if she is prgnant too? Why should she apologize? Her sister is nightmare. NTA.", "Well her sister started it. Sister should apologize first.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
