And why in the world can't 2 babies be celebrated together.", "NTA and I spot hints that one of you is the golden child here. If they didn't at least tell you that your sister had an announcement to make you couldn't have known that it would have been the wrong time to announce your pregnancy.\n\nIn addition your mothers outburst is way off target as it is much easier to harm the child early in the pregnancy than later on and your sister started yelling, so you just answered the same way.", "NTA \n\nYou did not know her plans. You had news to share at a family dinner, so you did. \n\nSo your sister can yell at you but you are not allowed to yell back? In what other ways do your parents favor your sister? Have you read up on Golden child/scapegoat? That's what sounds like is going on. And guess what? That will extend to your child. Her children will always be treated better than yours. It's up to you to protect them, or let them deal with it.", "So the moral of the story is that nobody cares that there is a second baby and there is only one Queen and her child is the only prince / princess ?\n\nDid they even noticed what you said and did they congratulate   ? like what the heck\n\nInstead of being happy that you both become moms and can share the struggle of I assume being first time moms together she wants to be the only one with a baby ?", "NTA. Your sister attacked first. Your sister\u2019s attack was dramatic and immature. It is odd that your family is asking you to take responsibility for your sister\u2019s bad behavior.", "NTA. The world does not revolve around your sister", "I'm cuirous how she would have reacted if you were  pregnant first . would you get all the attenion or is she really the goldenchild .\n\nwould they have  been as excited about your pregancy as they are about hers or would they push you asside and give her the queen satues even though you were first ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow often do you guys have dinner together ? Anyway there should be room for both babies . Is your family normally like that ?", "NTA honestly, I would go as far as to exclude all of the family for the next 9 months. Hard core, no contact. \nOnly associate with your friends and your husband's family. Your family doesn't deserve to be around during this time, and congratulations!", "NTA-but it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. If your sister yelled first, your mother\u2019s reaction either screams of favoritism or a hearing problem. Also, I\u2019m confused about the continued response. Weeks later they are still upset with you-over just that small bit of yelling match? I really think there is a LOT more to the history here. \n\nFundamentally, you can\u2019t be the AH for not reading your sister\u2019s mind. That\u2019s idiocy.\n\nMay I mention that you\u2019ll get a lot farther with your family if you skip the yelling stage when your sister yells. When she yells at you, you simply push your chair out and leave the room or the house. That\u2019s it. With that move, you\u2019ve dismantled the entire situation in your favor.", "I saw above that you didn\u2019t know she was going to reveal the gender, so I\u2019m going to go with NTA.

Yelling is absolutely bad for the baby. So baby and I will be distancing ourselves from family drama. We\u2019ll probably let you know when the baby is born.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "Well Y T A for getting pregnant just to copy and spite your sister and take her spotlight /s\n\nCLEARLY NTA, not only did she yell at you first, she completely overshadowed your announcement! A normal person would be happy that their child would have a cousin so close in age. She could have just announced it anyway after you said your news. I didn\u2019t know there was a limit on how many people can share exciting news at a family dinner? And your mother enabling this behavior\u2026we know who\u2019s going to be the favorite grandchild as well", "Nta you didn't know she was going to make an announcement. She also yelled at you so she deserves to be yelled at. Also yes yelling can be stressful but if someone doesn't have the coping skills and get so stressed that it's dangerous to the baby to be yelled at for a few minutes how the heck do they except to parent that child. Honestly your family is the asshole for clearly favouring your sister.", "Maybe because sister is the golden child, given by how mom jumped to rescue baby sister in distress yet yelling at OP, the same reason she was accusing OP of.\n\nSister obviously sounds a self-centred person, probably because of mommy's coddling \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.\n\nNTA OP. You have nothing to apologize for and be the \"bigger person\". Block all the flying monkeys.", "No it was just a family gathering we had no idea she was sharing her news she never told me. if she did i would have waited with my news .", "Defo need clarification on this, did you know the dinner was for a gender reveal? If so I\u2019d be tempted to say you MBTA and that you should have waited and let her have her moment, but if you didn\u2019t know then you\u2019re NTA it was just really unlucky timing", "So her pregnant sister can scream at her, but she cannot screqm back even if she is prgnant too? Why should she apologize? Her sister is nightmare. NTA.", "Well her sister started it. Sister should apologize first.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Two sisters pregnant at roughly the same time...kids will be close in age and potentially have an amazing cousin bond.\n\nThat's what matters. Not squabbling over who said what first or who overshadowed whose earth shattering gender declaration (newsflash, it's either male or female!)\n\nYour parents are fools for picking a side - no adult woman needs to have her toddler tantrums indulged, pregnant or not. You could have said your part, she could have said hers...and everyone celebrated together. It's fair to say you two don't have the best relationship and how that'll trickle down to how your kids relate to each other is anyone's guess.", "INFO: who initiated this family get together? Did sister say \u201clet\u2019s all get together for dinner,\u201d is it a regular family gathering, was mom feeling like he wanted her family together?", "NTA\n\nYour family is toxic. Go low to no contact. You will always be second best to that horrible sister of yours. Value yourself and good on your husband for standing by you. Make you own beautiful family.", "ESH. You both have volatile personalities. Some may say this is the hormones screaming, but I doubt it.", "NTA", "NTA - Why can there be not two good news foe the family\u2026.", "NTA... Stick to your guns. The fact that BOTH of you are pregnant and they told you it was bad for her baby and not yours worries me. If anything it's worse for you because pregnancy in the first trimester are the most high risk for miscarriage. Seems to me since they didn't tell you it's a gender reveal that sister may be a golden child who wants all the attention.", "NTA. My twin and I gave birth to kids less than 2 months apart, yet we had 0 yelling matches because we celebrated the other's pregnancy and milestones. Something is very wrong with your sister if her reaction to your pregnancy is well, yelling.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell them until they apologize and treat you better, they won\u2019t be part of your life.", "NTA. If I were you, when your mother says again about yelling, \n\n\"Yes mother, it is bad for the baby. Neither of us should have yelled. You do remember that I am also pregnant?\" \n\nJust walk away OP. Accept your sister is the golden child and her child will be the favoured one. Don't put your child through that. If your mother says anything give it to her straight \n\n\"I don't want my child to feel second best mother. It's something I will protect them from. Yes mother, I will protect my child from you\"", "Your sister is the golden child, proceed accordingly. NTA", "NTA\nThey seem to have a double standard in favor of your sister.", "The golden child and the scapegoat. Same situation, different treatment. Your family  created this horrible dynamic of 'You vs Her'. They back her up, while she is the one who is out of line.Absolutely unacceptable! I am sorry OP. You guys should all be celebrating together. And I hate to read how you are dismissed. \nI hope this gets adressed timely to preveny. To prevent this dynamic from being continued between your kids", ">and once i did my sister got really red and started yelling at me saying i was an attention seeker and said i knew she was gonna tell us her baby\u2019s gender at this dinner . I yelled back at her because she was way out of line i explained to her she needs to stop and sit down and it had NOTHING to do with her and stop being so self centered\n\nESH. It's hard to believe you two are about to be parents since you too are so imature.", "I mean NTA but you all sound like drama", "Unless it was your get together - which it clearly wasn't - you should have checked with the host that it was okay to make an announcement. Even if you didn't know that your sister planned to announce the gender you should always check that there aren't any other ppl making announcements when it's not your get-together.", "Your family doesn't know you are pregnant?\n\nYou weren't able to announce it at the dinner because you walked out?\n\nI think you are a bit jealous, perhaps reasonably so, for all the attention and \"pampering\" your sister has been received over the last few months.\n\nIs your sister the golden child?  THIS IS IMPORTANT\n\nYour sister clearly was out of line as you didn't know she was about to reveal the gender of her child.  You thought it was a safe time to announce your news.  Her screaming at you was uncalled for.  Either one of you could have agreed to withhold their announcement for another family get together.", "Who ask for that \"get together\"?", "What is wrong with your family? Is she the favourite child?\n\nNTA\n\nBut your parents and your sister are.\n\nI would expect an apology.", "Lmao.. you hit the nail on the head! \nI will never understand people with their crazy main character syndrome", "I really think there is a LOT more to the history here.", "Thank you for saying it!\nPeople are so focused on how the sister is the golden child, the rest of the family are TAs and everyone just forgot about her having a kid.. which in my opinion is significantly more important than a gender reveal", "Yup, and her kid will be second best in their eyes too.", "Not just 9 months. Do you REALLY think OP\u2019s baby is going to be as loved as sister\u2019s? That kid is already an also-ran to the grandparents.", "This is the best \"bigger person\" comment I have seen and so far the only one I can get behind.", "No.  But this is an isolated situation that we are privileged to have insight into. So I'm not gonna make grandiose assumptions over a situation despite not knowing the many years following up. \nSo no, I don't know that, neither do you or anyone else for that matter. I simply think that an appropriate response now, due to this singular incident, would be to cut all contact for the remaining pregnancy."]}
