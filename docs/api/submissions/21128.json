If they didn't at least tell you that your sister had an announcement to make you couldn't have known that it would have been the wrong time to announce your pregnancy.\n\nIn addition your mothers outburst is way off target as it is much easier to harm the child early in the pregnancy than later on and your sister started yelling, so you just answered the same way.", "NTA \n\nYou did not know her plans.

If a celebration like that becomes a competition for attention, then what was the point in the first place? To have your moment to shine and be praised? Sounds like everyone is being selfish here. If you were sad, I'd get it. But you got haughty - \"too bad, so sad, get over it\" is essentially what you said. \"The yelling isn't good for the baby\" is such a weird thing to say, but if this is how you respond to situations, you're going to have a really rough time with a child. People don't \"owe\" you attention no matter what you accomplish. They should give you that praise because they love you and are proud of you. Anger shows you feel like you didn't get something you deserved. Your sister was disappointed, then she got mad because you were an asshole to her. But she also seems to think she deserved more attention than you. From whom? A mother that would rather be on the winning side than mediate a conflict between her daughters? It seems like all three of you could learn a lesson about pride.\n\n Take some time apart. Your baby doesn't need that kind of environment, and you'll do better working on yourself away from their influence. And remember when you have a child that that kid doesn't owe you *anything*. *You* chose to bring them into this world. You should provide for them out of *unconditional love*. They don't owe you anything, no matter how much you give them, they shouldn't have to give a certain amount back to you to deserve your love.\n\nMaybe I'm going off too hard based on little info, but I take yelling at family members very seriously.
