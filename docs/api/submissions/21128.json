If they didn't at least tell you that your sister had an announcement to make you couldn't have known that it would have been the wrong time to announce your pregnancy.\n\nIn addition your mothers outburst is way off target as it is much easier to harm the child early in the pregnancy than later on and your sister started yelling, so you just answered the same way.", "NTA \n\nYou did not know her plans. You had news to share at a family dinner, so you did. \n\nSo your sister can yell at you but you are not allowed to yell back? In what other ways do your parents favor your sister?
