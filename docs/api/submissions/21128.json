Do they think people will love the child less if they have the \u201cwrong\u201d parts?\n\nAnd this extends to stuff like \u201cboys wear blue and girls wear pink.\u201d Children weren\u2019t color-coded like that until after WW2, and the main reason for it was capitalism: strict segregation of everything from toys and books to clothes and even colors means parents are forced to buy an entirely new set of *everything* for each baby, instead of just reusing the same stuff for each kid until it finally falls apart. \n\nBefore WW2, infants and even toddlers all wore the same basic white dresses because they made changing diapers easier and were much, much easier to clean.", "I knew at the shower that they were having a baby girl and intentionally bought stuff that is less gendered for baby. Why?\n\nI was not into pink frills and princesses as a kid and if this kiddo wants to not be into that, I will not impose societal standards of pink frills because of chromosomes and a vagina. I have both, and don't like pink or frilly. I never wanted to be the princess and get rescued. I wanted to fight my own dragons.\n\nI still buy that lil baby all the less marketed to little girls things. Why? Because she can pick her clothes out now and can get whatever she wants. Toys are toys. Books are books.\n\nLike what you like, little one. Society can go stuff itself.\n\nTook well into my adulthood to realize I wasn't a tomboy or less girly. I'm a girl and I like whatever the heck I like.\n\nNobody should go into their adulthood thinking they are less manly or less of a woman because of a damn color preference or whether they like GI Joe or baking with their mom.", "\"Dunno, fingers crossed for human!\"\n\n\"We're not sure, but hoping for them to be polite enough to not harrass strangers.\"\n\n\"Torn betwen Balrog or Baphomet. Hard to tell on the sonogram. Just keep seeing these weird sigils appearing on the screen. Makes it hard to see the features. Darndest thing.\"\n\n\"...I'm not pregnant. What is wrong with you?\"\n\n\"My partner is a Star Wars fan, but I've always been more into fantasty myself. Hoping for a Lord of the Rings Fan.

(This is how you typically reply to a pregnancy announcement, especially if it\u2019s your daughter and sister)You are NTA. I really hope your husband\u2019s family  is supportive. This is an exciting time, this is a vulnerable time. Surround yourself with nothing but love. You have to protect yourself and your little one as well. You are building your own family now and sometimes you have to make difficult decisions to keep them safe. I\u2019m sorry the announcement to your family didn\u2019t go the way it should have. Just know there will be a lot of people who will be happy to share your excitement and I am one of them. Protect yourself and enjoy your pregnancy!!", "Get petty, if your husbands family is good, send updates on how amazing his family is, how supportive it is. NTA", "NTA\n\nPregnancy is already a hard time for a woman... And to see it all affected by family drama makes it awful... \nYou enjoy your pregnancy, it's awesome you were able to have this experience even if it was hard.\nWith spoiled people is impossible to reason. I would tell you: don't expect an apology from any of them, and you decide who you want to be part of this process, but in reality it gets super hard as time passes, its easier with the help of your family. In my case, my mom has been my life savior throughout all the pregnancy and first years... But if your family cannot support you in the way yo need it... You don't need toxic people around either. Good luck!!! Enjoy your pregnancy and sleep all you can! You really suffer from the lack of sleep once the baby is born, is for real!", "YNTA.\nYour sister is a narcissist and your mother and family are hypocritically enabling that spoiled brat.", "Waiting for what happened next. Btw, NTA", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nShe wasn't going to announce the gender, just what genitals the foetus has.", "If I had any advice for this family it\u2019s to be excited that these cousins will get to grow up together.  Do not use them as a means of oneupmanship.  NTA but it would be great to get family therapy", "NTA your sister is being very disrespectful to you just because she's pregnant doesn't mean she's someone made of gold she's being mean and selfish and your family to. I think they deserve to be ignored because they didn't support you and they put you as the bad guy in this situation", "NTA You have to be sensitive to your sister but you don't deserve people to be sensitive to you? She started it to begin with\n I would tell my mom I don't appreciate the way she treated my husband and since your sister is evidently pregnant with the wanted grandchild, the family doesn't have to worry about you being insensitive to your sister because you will be busy raising your child.  You will not subject your child to the favoritism you endured.", "NTA I think OC sister Is getting a bit too spoiled and she thought that all the attention on her and when you told you were pregnant she that you're going to steal everything that your family done for her when she was pregnant", "You are NTA. Mom and sister were way out of line. I'm so sorry you are dealing with this situation. Congratulations on you upcoming bundle of joy.", "I came here to say this that sadly she's the golden child so they're treating her with love while calling you ridiculous.\n\nTime to cut contact fully and enjoy your pregnancy with your hubby alone.\n\nEdit: My bad, Congratulations \ud83c\udf89. I hope you've a lovely and safe pregnancy followed by a safe delivery.", "I used to say, I don\u2019t know but I\u2019m hoping for a puppy, watching people process that was glorious.", "YTA - Yelling at a pregnant sister? That's a baby's first language lesson: \"Mommy, I can hear you!\" \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude02", "NTA- go NC with the whole group of them. They don't deserve the joy of your baby! Congratulations and take good care of yourself!", "NTA but your side of the family is. You don\u2019t owe them anything and it would probably be beneficial if your child had very limited exposure to their behavior.", "Bad OP! Naughty OP! \n\nHow dare you. You had the nerve to conceive and tell your parents over dinner. You stole her spotlight. Her only recourse was to make up something quick and scream at you about it.  \n\nWow. I\u2019m sorry you had to deal with that, NTA but your family is. Keep your distance until they pull their collective head out of their collective rectum.", "NTA. I would LOVE IT if my sister and I were pregnant at the same time! It means the cousins would be the same age, who could be mad at that?", "Now that we have established who the favorite is", "NTA.\n\nHow can you be an attention seeker? All you did was get pregnant. Pregnancies can't be planned no matter how hard people try. Your sister sounds super selfish", "NTA\n\nThat's a lot of hypocrisy for one family. Bad enough your sister has loads of it, but your mom actually backed her up on it? WTAF?", "Defo put family on a timeout. Do you have a close relationship with SOs family? If so celebrate with them and be sure to post many pics to social media especially if they throw you a bigger party than your golden child sister got.", "This is so weird. When your sister yelled at you first was she not as loud as when you yelled at her or something? Why would they all target you instead of her if both were yelling? I don\u2019t get it. Did you say something meaner?\n\nI say NTA but I might chalk the entire situation up to everyone\u2019s hormones, or at least your sister\u2019s, and whatever else is in the air with 2 babies coming\u2014I assume you all will make up and it\u2019s actually so awesome your kids will immediately have a cousin exactly their age to play with. The sooner you all get over it the better. Although they\u2019re making it harder by continuously reaching out to blame it on you. If they didn\u2019t do they this could probably blow over way more quickly.", "Personally, I wanted to know because until we knew every time I called the baby \"they\" I had to follow up with \"But there's only one in there, the tech checked very carefully!\", especially when talking to anyone who knew we did fertility treatment. It was literally for pronoun convenience.", "I mean, I completely agree with you, but I hardly think infant and toddler wear inspire gender dysmorphia. Putting an infant in blue is not the same as later snatching a doll from his hands and telling him those are for girls.", "Most children are able to vocalize gender norms and start showing understanding of gender norms in their clothing and game choices somewhere between ages two to three.\n\nThey start changing how they play and engaging in gendered play at age two. They can identify male and female dolls. They start selecting toys as girl toys and boy toys.\n\nThat recognition starts *incredibly* young, actually.\n\nPart of that is gendered clothing. Children are able to internalize those messages very young. Boys wear blue. Girls wear pink. Boys like trucks, because boys' shirts have trucks. Girls like princesses, because their shirts have princesses. The amount of information children absorb and reiterate is massive, especially as children at that age engage in play to emulate adults. They mimic adults and start trying to learn those social behaviors. They see other kids doing the same.\n\nI know a transgender young adult who started exhibiting extreme behavioral issues as young as 18 months old because he didn't want to wear dresses or have long hair. He went to numerous child psychologists and therapy starting before age two because of the outbursts. He was incredibly opposed to emulating female behaviors and social norms. Eventually, he had a diagnosis and was socially transitioned in childhood and all his behavioral outbursts stopped.\n\nYou'd really be surprised how deeply engrained those behaviors are and how quickly our social development starts. Large part is gender roles.\n\nThe gender roles I grew up with were very narrow. Not any dysphoria in terms of questioning my being female, but I absolutely felt like I was an outsider. I never remember not feeling like I was way too different and I had a hard time making friends with other girls because I wasn't like them. Or, maybe I just felt that way and they picked up on it.\n\nThe person they expected me to be wasn't who I naturally was, or my own expectations of self vs reality were so off I felt wrong. By telling kids these roles aren't so rigid, maybe they feel more comfortable in their own skin or are more welcoming of kids who don't fit into the frilly princess box, or the monster trucks and dinosaurs box.\n\nIdentity development starts under age two. It's quite established by age four.\n\nToddler clothing choices can actually impact their image of male and female and self."]}
