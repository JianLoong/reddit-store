F1 literally harassed you until you threatened to take it to court, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to not want her to be in your house. You have a history of ptsd, and it\u2019s absolutely **not** a-hole behaviour to watch out for your own mental health.

Still, you should know that you if you raise it, you are basically asking your sister to choose, so just be prepared for that. It's not like you don't want to be a bridesmaid - you accepted before you found out F1 was a bridesmaid too. You don't want to be a bridesmaid **because** F1 is also a bridesmaid, which to your sister will sound like she has to make a choice.", "NTA. Your sister has some nerve and you're handling this as graciously as possible.", "NTA. If your parents want peace they should tell your sister to uninvited your abuser.", "NTA. I think you're very wise to try and walk away from this, but I expect your sister will not react well, and F1 will take advantage of this to make your life crap. Sorry it's going to be a bad situation regardless, but I think you should step out of being bridesmaid.\n\n Your sister is an AH for having F1 as a bridesmaid despite knowing your history. There will be no peace regardless of what you do, your parents are dreaming.", "NTA. You're avoiding someone who harassed you. I'm sorry your fam aren't supporting you. I cannot imagine being ok with my daughter having someone at her wedding that abused her sibling, much less in the bridal party.", "NTA  I would straight up tell her you won't do it with F1 there, let her make the choice. Don't be surprised if she chooses F1 though. Also let her know that she will not be allowed in your house and if she tries you'll call the cops.", "NTA\n\nEspecially considering the fact your sister knows the history of what all happened.\n\nYou are setting a boundary in place to protect yourself, and that is entirely reasonable. You are not making her choose, you\u2019re excusing yourself. As long as you explain everything calmly, then you are not breaking the peace. If she gets upset about you backing out try to keep your composure, and explain that you\u2019re not doing this to hurt her in anyway, but you\u2019re doing this to prevent any issues since you have no trust in F1. That you understand that F1 is her friend. That you\u2019re sorry if this hurts her but your physical, mental and emotional health are too important to you to be potentially jeopardized. Maybe offer to do a reading (or something) instead so you are still involved, just not in the bridal party to limit contact with F1. \n\nI honestly can\u2019t believe your sister would be friends with someone knowing the history. I cannot fathom doing that to one of my sisters. \n\nBest of luck!", "NTA, I\u2019d just tell your sister how you are feeling and decline.", "NTA you are protecting your peace and that\u2019s important.", "Nta.

I understand that somethings just never go away and so can understand why you wouldn't want to be anywhere near F1, but maybe your sister hasn't really considered it would still be this impactful? (people can be a bit blind to things when they haven't lived it personally)", "NTA. Expecting you to just suck it up, not even a conversation or a proper heads up, makes your sister the asshole in this situation. Does she think if she just ignores the issue it will go away? You shouldn't be expected to make pleasant small talk and be civil with someone who harassed you, let alone be expected to welcome them into your home. It's too much.", "NTA. Your sister should understand (also she shouldn\u2019t have asked F1 but that\u2019s another story) that you don\u2019t want to interact with this person.

It's her or me.\n\nWhat's weird is your mom's behavior.  \"It is that well known that my mum called months ago to tell me F1 was coming to niece and nephew party and that I was to keep the peace or not come.\"  What is that?  You mentioned the groom knows F1, but how is F1 involved in your niece and nephews party?  Are these children of the groom and sister?  Why would your mom tell you not to come if you can't behave?  Just who's side is she on, and what all is going on here?  This behavior is strange unless we're missing something.", "Does your sister know about your history with this girl? NTA but maybe you could still be a bridesmaid and not interact with F1 - say you can't host the bridal party getting ready at your house anymore and maybe your parents can host it instead.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just be careful and respectful with your sister when you tell her, so the pace is kept as much as possible. Good luck.", "NTA.\n\nIt would be one thing if your sister was unaware of the past. However since she is aware and has included F1 in her bridal party , alot of questions come up. First is the groom to be pressuring her to include F1.

Seems really odd to have her take part.   \n\nI would suggest talking to her and then respectfully excluding yourself.", "Stepping down is keeping the peace. Your reaction is totally appropriate.

Have a chat with your sister, just the two of you, and tell her you can't accommodate her with getting ready in your house and can no longer be a bridesmaid. You will happily attend as a guest but you understand if she doesn't want to have you there (because she may well not if you step back). This is your mental health that's at risk here and it's not worth the anxiety of having to be involved with somebody who treated you so badly. You don't have to bow to your parents pressure either.

Take care of you.", "NTA  - your sister invited somebody she knew had threatened you , to be her bridesmaid?
