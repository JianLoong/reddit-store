So this is where we part ways.\" \n\nIt is important that you couch your removal of yourself from the bridal party as a removal of yourself from their lives otherwise they will try and bully you into doing what they want.", "NTA. Back out. Don't let her anywhere near your house.", "Your sister is the A for even asking F1 to be a bmade.", "NTA. You're not even asking them to drop her, you just don't want to have to interact with her. This is perfectly reasonable, unlike your parents. You don't need their permission to take care of yourself.", "Nta, \"to keep the peace\" often requires the harmed to tolerate further harm. Why don't they ask your sister to disinvite her to keep the peace?", "NTA but your sister should choose you and not the other girl. Just saying. If someone did that to my sister, I would not what anything to do with them.", "Say it with me:\n\n\u201dif protecting my peace makes me the villain, then bitch I am Thanos.\u201d Snap snap snap\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA,  if your sister knew the history between the 2 of you and still asked her, yes definitely back out. If you decide not to go altogether that's fine also. She disrespected you by even being friends with her. It shows how little she cares about you. Your parents are backing your sister up, well they sucks also, it's best they stay out of it.  NTA", "NTA for refusing to be in the wedding party with someone you had to threaten with a restraining order. WTF was your sister thinking inviting this person to her wedding?", "Nope. Simply say no. They already know the reason. Don't put yourself in the situation where you have to explain the reason for it to dozens of ppl in the wedding party. That'd be bring up your trauma unnecessarily", "Wouldn't F1 be breaking the restraining order if they were both bridesmaids? \n\nOnce again, saying you will be in the wedding is not a contract. It is a favor. You do NOT have to go.\n\nRemember \"NO.\" is a complete sentence.", "NTA. Your first priority should be your mental health.", "NTA", "NTA. Absolutely not. Keep yourself safe. If your sister is choosing this woman over you, then that\u2019s on her. I wouldn\u2019t be going to the wedding. You\u2019ll be an anxious mess the whole time. I would be.", "NTA. Drama for the sake of drama. Your health comes first.", "Your sister and parents are AH. I would take a hard long look at my relationship with them.", "NTA. But if it were me I would stand my ground. I have an abusive family friend (cut from my life) that  randomly shows up to my public events. I just stare him down and he slinks away. It\u2019s your home and your sister. Stand up tall, and have a great time. Vermin can\u2019t stand that crap.", "NTA, remind your sister that you have an active restraining order again F1. They won\u2019t even be legally allowed to be at the wedding and can be arrested, if the order specifies a distance.", "NTA.  Contact your sister she now out.  Tell her you know this person is a bridesmaid and you will not be standing near her or will she be allowed in your house so your sister will have to make other arrangements. If it was me, I\u2019d send a gift, but not attend.", "It seems as though your family would literally prefer you die than inconvenience F1 given the severity of problems she\u2019s help cause you. \n\nNTA but what the fuck is wrong with your family?", "Does your mum even like you? I mean she sounds awful.", "Your sister and your family know your history with F1 and they still allow her around you? I'm so sorry. No you won't be the AH, there is nothing wrong with having boundaries. Be ready though because your sister and parents may be very ready to gaslight you about this. Stand your ground", "NTA - but back out now so your sister can make alternative plans. Also tell her why.", "NTA. No is a sentence. Your sister knows why you're stepping down.", "NTA", "NTA and honestly, your sister really sucks to put you in that position. I wouldn't attend the wedding at all. I would also tell my parents they suck if they can't accept that you have every right and reason to avoid someone you needed to get a restraining order for.", "Why are you so angry with a one year old female?", "This is an extremely generous way to respond and frankly more than OP\u2019s sister deserves, but probably the best option since it sounds like OP is trying to walk the line of maintaining her boundaries while keeping the peace with her god awful sister.", ">I'd be taking a hard look at your relationship with her if she's willing to even SPEAK to this person\n\nWorse than speak. OP's sister thought it was OK for this person to come to OP's own house after all that happened. And parents are acting as AH too by saying she should keep the peace.\n\n~~Well, removing yourself from a situation is one of the best ways to achieve peace, so OP is NTA.~~\n\nEdit: I just read one of OP's comments where she says that F1 was invited to niblings party, and that OP's own mother said if she couldn't keep the peace it would be better not to go.\n\nOP, you're NTA. If you feel safer not attending the wedding at all, then DON'T. After all, your own mother set the tone for this on the occasion of the party, right?\n\n(After this I would go LC, because none of them has any respect for your mental health)."]}
