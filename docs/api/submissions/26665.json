I have some nice earrings that were $40.  If that is what you are talking about, then make sure you specify that.

If a $10k ring is your idea of excessive, I'm curious to know what you consider reasonable.\n\nWhat did you get him for his birthday?", "Info: did you give him specific ideas or examples, so he realizes your expectations?", "I think you are fine. It was a question he asked, and you gave an honest answer. You are also right, it doesn't have to be an expensive gift, especially since you are just starting to date. \n\nI recently bought my girlfriend a nice ring for her birthday last month that didn't cost a ton of money, and we just hit our two year mark. I am sure he is concerned with the price and what to buy you, so just be sure to help him out. I asked her, and she said she really wanted something with her birthstone in it, so that helped me narrow down what to get. [I went with this peridot stone ring](https://audryrosestyle.com/starry-peridot-trillion-ring) which I knew would be something she would like, and she ended up loving it. \n\nYou need to communicate with him and tell him what you may be looking for to help ease some of his worry.", "I'm waiting on the answers to the many questions to make my judgement, The example you used is over the top, are we talking something $50 or more?", "NAH, he asked you what you want, and you gave him an answer. Can\u2019t be an asshole just because he didn\u2019t anticipate the answer. \n\nInfo. Has his birthday come and gone yet? Did he ask for something more personal for a gift or did he want something more materialistic? Idk your relationship, but maybe he\u2019s just not on the same page on where you two find yourself in the relationship. That could be why he was taken back by the jewelry.", "Saying you\u2019d like jewelry is fine but you need to be specific about what. If he gets you some nice costume jewelry (aka not real gold or diamonds), is that fine? If you are expecting some $500 diamond studs or $1000 necklace then that\u2019s a bit excessive for a birthday one year into a relationship.", "NTA for wanting jewelry, as long as you'd be happy with jewelry that he can reasonably afford. If he can afford a $200 necklace and you're hinting about one that's five times that much, then you're asking for trouble for both of you.", "Info: do you have a specific set in mind? Do you the target price point or \u201ccap\u201d? Is it reasonable for his income? The fact that you said you don\u2019t want something \u201cexcessive like a 10K engagement ring\u201d when you\u2019re relationship isn\u2019t even a year old is setting off some warning bells. And what happens if he can\u2019t afford what you\u2019re wanting?", "If you mean jewelry like Kendra Scott or other well made costume jewelry sure NTA. if you are asking for 14K jewelry in the $500+ range then YTA, you haven\u2019t been dating a year yet. What did you get him for his birthday??", "You might want to give him some more hints about the kind of jewelry. For example, point some of the things you like out when you're walking past sop windows.\n\nNAH", "Nta for asking, but make clear you are ok with a cheaper piece and also for context what did you get him for his birthday?", "I don\u2019t see anything wrong with this. There\u2019s jewelry available at all price points.", "Op, how much are you willing to spend on your partner for their birthday?", "I got a swiss army knife for my first birthday in our relationship.

But I think our ideas of nice jewelry, is very different, and we all have different economies. And let's be honest, if you want some jewelry that are nice and gonna last they have to be a bit pricy. Maybe he would rather buy you quality jewelry, than something cheap that is gonna wear off in a month? I think it is good that you told him your wishes and I hope he can fulfill them. But try to be understanding because you can never put a price on love.", "NAH - I just think he probably is thinking Tiffany's or diamonds. Sit down with him, show him some examples in your style and the kind of price range, it'll be less intimidating", "INFO: Have you defined what type of jewelry you want? For me, I have to be very specific. I can't wear costume jewelry or anything fake. I have to have sterling, 10k or higher gold and NOT gold plated, or platinum. I can't even wear those hypoallergenic ones without reacting to them. And that was something I told my now husband right from the start. It was kind of a running joke, that I would know, without ever having an official appraisal, if he ever bought me anything fake. LOL. With that being said, you can find some really nice pieces for good prices, if you know what to look for. But I think you and him should sit down and define what kind of jewelry you're looking for.", "NTA\n\nbut also like give him a price range so he doesn\u2019t get you an earring set for 25 dollars when you were thinking of an item in the hundred range. Or some other example. \n\nCause then we\u2019d have a post from your bf being all about like \u201cAITA for getting my gf some earrings for her birthday?\u201d", "When I was with my EX I always also wanted jewelry. What I did was send him a list of necklaces with the links included prices ranging from $40-$200 and he always picked something right around the middle. It worked perfectly and I always got what I wanted \n\nNTA but sometimes boys need help haha", "INFO: What are YOU giving HIM for his birthday?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAsking for jewelry really makes you sound like a golddigger.", "Depends entirely on what kind of price range you\u2019re thinking and whether you communicated it to him.", "NTA.  I think he was taken back because he does not know much about jewelry.    Find some jewelry shopping channels and watch it  a lot and have him watch too.  to learn.  Then visit some pawnshops and look at jewelry.  He will be a little knowledgeable about gemstones, and then he will be surprised how cheap a nice piece can be at a pawnshop.", "I would expect at the least something made out of solid gold so that the person wouldn't potentially have a skin reaction or need to worry about tarnishing. I wouldn't give anything under \\~$150 as a  major life event gift most likely (unless it was a super dainty piece) because the quality just won't be there unless you *know* this person loves titanium or sterling silver or lab-created jewels or something (which OP would have to specify).", "What kind of a necklace do you get in $200?", "My favourite necklaces (tho I am fond of handmade items and don\u2019t particularly like precious metals or diamonds) were all (4 of them) under 30$ each. Idk about OP but personally I love jewelry but I would prefer something cheaper (under $30) that my partner spent time choosing or making to suit me vs anything expensive"]}
