But I think our ideas of nice jewelry, is very different, and we all have different economies. And let's be honest, if you want some jewelry that are nice and gonna last they have to be a bit pricy. Maybe he would rather buy you quality jewelry, than something cheap that is gonna wear off in a month? I think it is good that you told him your wishes and I hope he can fulfill them. But try to be understanding because you can never put a price on love.", "NAH - I just think he probably is thinking Tiffany's or diamonds. Sit down with him, show him some examples in your style and the kind of price range, it'll be less intimidating", "INFO: Have you defined what type of jewelry you want? For me, I have to be very specific. I can't wear costume jewelry or anything fake. I have to have sterling, 10k or higher gold and NOT gold plated, or platinum. I can't even wear those hypoallergenic ones without reacting to them. And that was something I told my now husband right from the start. It was kind of a running joke, that I would know, without ever having an official appraisal, if he ever bought me anything fake. LOL. With that being said, you can find some really nice pieces for good prices, if you know what to look for.

I wouldn't give anything under \\~$150 as a  major life event gift most likely (unless it was a super dainty piece) because the quality just won't be there unless you *know* this person loves titanium or sterling silver or lab-created jewels or something (which OP would have to specify).", "What kind of a necklace do you get in $200?", "My favourite necklaces (tho I am fond of handmade items and don\u2019t particularly like precious metals or diamonds) were all (4 of them) under 30$ each.

Jewelry ranges in price range. It\u2019s a completely normal gift. IMO many guys would default to getting jewelry! You can get really cool and unique earrings for 50 bucks or less.

The only thing to be wary of is if you want certain harder-to-find gems, like alexandrite or grandidierite (gem quality stones for it are quite rare), so you'll want to make sure the seller can provide a certificate from a gemological lab stating it's natural because both stones can and have been marketed as those stones but are actually far more common stones like topaz or tourmaline.", "Yep, I would never feel comfortable buying jewelry on there if it weren't just a solid hunk of a common metal!", "Funny enough, it's easy to tell if the more common stones (sapphires, rubies, emerald, etc) are natural or not by just looking at them. Natural stones, unless they are genuinely flawless (which you almost certainly will not find on places like etsy), will have impurities that can look like lines, or black spots or maybe even more opaque or cloudy. Jewelry stores seriously lose out by not selling these, because more often than not, the stones are actually quite beautiful. Plus, you're literally getting a one of a kind stone."]}
