I was laid off and had to take a new job that is 100% in the office and pays half what I made before ($104k -> $52k). This has been a real struggle. My commute is 35 miles each way and takes 45 minutes each way.\n\nMy mom has had a lot of medical appointments recently, which has been difficult to juggle. She drops me off at work, goes home, goes to her appointments, and then picks me up from work. \n\nEvery time she does this, it takes over half a tank of gas, plus leaves me without a car at work. My job occasionally requires traveling to different sites, and I've had to tell my boss once already that I couldn't that day because I didn't have my car. \n\nSo, I've been putting up with this because there aren't really any other options. It is what it is.\n\nBut, now my mom is using my car to run her friend around also. Today, she is taking her friend to the hospital. She didn't ask me, just told me. She's dropping me off, taking her friend to the hospital, going home, picking up her friend's kid, etc. \n\nI am annoyed by this. Her friend has two adult sons. Her son has a car but is being a dick and refusing to take her or let her use the car. \n\nI didn't say my mom couldn't use the car, but I was visibly frustrated at the arrangement. My mom got mad that I wasn't pretending to be all hunky dory about it. \n\nThis is exceptionally inconvenient for me and also expensive. Gas isn't cheap. Normally, I use 3/4 tank of gas for the whole week, but when she does this it takes more than half a tank for one day. \n\nMy mom is acting like my annoyance is done kind of lack of generosity and makes me a bad person.", "created_utc": 1697032601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175emi9/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_my_mom_is_using_my/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My FIL used to steal my car constantly when we briefly lived with him (we helped pay bills and he would also steal my money from me). I was totally fine to share since we were living there, but he refused to let me keep my own keys, I had to submit my work schedule to him in advance in case he needed the car (his needs took preference), and he would often ignore the schedule and I\u2019d go outside to leave for work and the car would just be gone, so I\u2019d have to call out and jeopardize my job. Then again, he was also abusive and when I told him I wanted to keep the keys with me, he attempted to choke me out (my wife intervened and got choked instead while I was trying to push him off of her).

You no longer work \u201c100% from home\u201d.  You need your car to be always available.  So now it needs to be off-limits to her.  She can\u2019t use it anymore, and that\u2019s what you need to tell her.

It's going to be hard to set that boundary living at home, though, even if you do pay rent.  Maybe you could give her a mile limit a week?
