I'm almost done and it's been a lifelong dream of my mother's to have her children graduate from college. \n\nMy relationship with my stepdad has been problematic from the very beginning. It, however, turned into full no contact with my family back when I went to college the first time. My mother had saved child support payments for years so I could go to college. My junior and senior years of high school they had my two younger half-brothers and my stepdad forced me to drop out of all extracurriculars so I could take care of them after school which severely hurt my chances of scholarships. I got into the college I wanted to go to, but passed on it to go to community college at home to save money. A year into it I was informed by my stepdad I needed to take a full time job to help pay for college or they wouldn't pay for anymore of it. I was still taking care of my younger brothers. He was not working and she had just retired from the military. I was living with them and did what he wanted. A semester later and he said I had to pay for the full amount because I wasn't getting straight A's, which was true because I was exhausted. \n\nI talked to my mom and she asked about the college money and he admitted that it was all gone. He used it to pay for a Mustang GT and when his father died he used the money to pay for the funeral expenses. I was livid and called him out, but argued with my mother about it and about how she allowed this to happen. I moved out and left them to take care of my younger brothers by themselves and went full no contact for years.\n\nA couple of years ago I had a pretty severe health scare and contacted them again to try and make amends and rebuild a relationship. My mother tried but my stepdad did not. He was constantly belittling my efforts, my masculinity, my profession, and my art. I told my mom about getting ready for graduation, but that he was not invited. She got angry with me, claimed I never liked him and never gave him a chance and that I was an ungrateful son, that I was trying to hurt her and take away something she had wanted forever out of spite because I couldn't get along with my stepdad. I said she could come and so could my brothers but I'm standing firm that my stepdad has to stay away. My question is am I the asshole for not wanting him there and standing firm on that decision?", "created_utc": 1673309715, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107uxzb/aita_for_not_wanting_my_stepdad_at_my_college/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have the right to choose who you want to go to your graduation. Your stepfather can go to hell for the way he treated you all these years.

He stole your college money, didn't support you financially or emotionally and treated you like crap.  This is your accomplishment, not your mom's, and she shouldn't bring someone who mistreated you to make herself feel better.", "This man stole your college money, and your mom allowed it.  You were right to go no contact. Go back to the no contact. They're horrible humans.", "\"I was trying to hurt her and take away something she had wanted forever out of spite.\"Boo Hoo!! She chose her dick husband over you again and again. NTA.", "NTA, and your mother's just as bad and doesn't deserve to be there either.", "edited to NTA ~~ESH~~ now with clarification that stepfather may actually insult op during the function. \n\nCollege graduations are open to the public in my experience, so you don't really have any standing to keep him away. Obviously if it's ticketed, then you can keep him away... but should you?\n\nOne thing to keep in mind: your mom didn't do anyone any favors by hoarding your child support money. You were incurring expenses during your years living with your mother and step-father. But that doesn't seem like the root of the issue, either. \n\nStepdad sounds like a dick. You sound like a dick too for wanting to control how your relationship is rebuilt. In other words, your step-father was good enough for you when you had a severe health scare, but now he's not good enough for you to attend your graduation?", "Totally agree! Even if stepdad was amazing you still have no obligation to invite him. And he is an asshole.\n\nYou are NTA", "The man OP's mom married and *who stole OP's college fund \u2013 which represented all the child support his father had paid over the years \u2013 to buy himself a f___ing car*.", "yeah, no. while i'm sure it varies state to state, generally children do not have the property interest in child support payments made from one spouse to another. \n\nthis is what perpetually gnaws at child support paying men: that the recipient spouse isn't actually using it in a way of their liking.", "He was not in my life for most of my life. My mom was insistent that I should have no contact with him and that he was a horrible drug addict. After my health scare I got in contact with him and he admitted to doing drugs and being abusive to her, apologized for all the hurt he caused, and asked if we could try to build a relationship. I\u2019ve been doing it slowly but he has been very supportive of me and has made a lot of strides to build trust with me now that we have some contact.", "The job at the time was paying minimum wage at 7.50 an hour. I was taking full classes and had to also pay for my car insurance, gas, and any food I was going to eat while I was not at home.\n\nShe thinks I\u2019m trying to tear the family apart and that by disinviting him she has no choice but to not come.\n\nShe is fully capable of coming on her own and I also invited my younger brothers who are completely blameless in all this. I offered to pay for gas if they needed it to get there. We live fairly close about an hour away from each other.", "I suppose a little more context might help. I didn\u2019t ask them to help me with my health. I almost died and felt that I should try to talk to my family and get past any past hurts. My mom and stepdad weren\u2019t the only ones I did this with, I also got in contact with my dad who I had no relationship at all and began building one with him as well. They didn\u2019t help me during the health scare, this is all happening as a result of it and me wanting to put effort into rebuilding relationships with family.", "Seriously, your mom is not on the sidelines here, she also made you the parent to your siblings, and stole the child support money.", "And in this case it was the recipient Ex\u2019s new spouse who misspent the money.  Ugh", "That\u2019s great! I love when people are able to get better and change. I\u2019m a big believer in second chances.\n\nWhat\u2019s your relationship like with your brothers? Do they k ow about the theft and blatant favoritism from stepdad?", "Your mom is being an AH by enabling him. Do NOT invite him and if she chooses to not attend, that\u2019s her own choice. And in the long run, I bet that\u2019s better for you.", "Stand your ground. \n\nThey've both been disrespectful, and this celebration is not about them. \n\nYour mother may be claiming that you graduating from college was a dream of hers but she did nothing to secure a college account for you or help you.\n\nShe sided with your step-father in how the money was used/not saved, she allowed you to be used as a babysitter for your siblings, and she was dishonest.\n\nHer desire to be at your graduation is selfish, it's not about celebrating you. \n\nCongratulations on graduating!", "right, but this doesn't really change my point. you had a health scare and that's when you \"felt that I should try to talk to my family and get past any past hurts\"\n\nin other words, you decided on the time and place of (attempted) reconciliation. \n\nmaybe this is your stepfather's try at it. maybe he feels that your college graduation, fulfilling your and your mother's dreams, is a good time to try to talk to you and get past any hurt...\n\nedit: i guess i don't see what you're gaining by asking that he not participate, beyond the accute/short-term enjoyment of the denial? you're clearly upsetting your mother and you may (but may not) be depriving yourself and your stepfather of an opportunity to reconcile. for what? the fleeting good feeling of retribution?\n\nthe only context in which I can see your actions making sense is if your stepfather has no social graces whatsoever. If it's likely that he's going to publicly demean you on that day and can't otherwise act with proper decorum, then yeah maybe your actions are justified. But that may be better addressed by addressing this concern with your mother and see if she has a read on that.", "not necessarily. \n\nMom hoards $100 for OP to use later. Mom and Dad spend $100 on OP's living expenses. Dad now faces a $100 funeral expense. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with transferring the $100 from Mom to Dad in this scenario. \n\nYes, i get he bought a car, but that's just a slightly less savory version of the above.", "My relationship with my brothers is good. I try to help them out when I can, let them talk about stuff they\u2019re into and give them clothes I\u2019ve outgrown or don\u2019t wear which they love, and have taught them basic boxing techniques and how to do photography. They aren\u2019t aware of any of the problems my stepdad and I have had and I have no intention of making that clear to them any time soon.", "So what you\u2019re saying is I had no right to try and reconcile with him and by disinviting him I\u2019ve ruined any chance at attempting to do so?", "Did you miss the part where OP tried to reconcile and his step dad just continued to be a dick? Do you really think he is going to change?", "How old are they?", "(check out my edit if you didn't already and then i'll respond)", "He has no social decorum and has on several occasions used homophobic slurs to describe me, in public, in front of his family or friends. The main reason I don\u2019t want him there is because the plan is to have the graduation then a celebration at a public place with friends and my family, but he\u2019s always felt the need to try and tear me down in a public arena for some reason.", "Yeah, then your actions are far more justifiable. \n\nYour mom lays at the center of this. I'd explain to her your concerns here. Hopefully she's not so self-centered as to make this about her and her experience of your graduation. \n\nIf you are provided reasonable assurances that your stepfather wouldn't be a complete boorish asshole at the ceremony/celebration, then perhaps revisit your decision."]}
