It is a basic requirement to get your children medical care and they have denied you that on three occasions.

I'd be worried about brittle bones too. \n\nAs to a broad imagination, it is hard to imagine actual bones breaking and periods of pain where they weren't treated.  How they treat your brothers is how any injured child should be treated and a pretty low bar to meet. You need to talk to someone independent - are you at school/college? Do you have a trusted adult in your life? \n\nWhat are your plans for the next stage in your life?

Is your aunt a possibility for supporting you and possibly getting you a different place to live? Please consider telling someone everything thats happened/ happening. You deserve better.", "NTA.

The contrast between how the parents treated Ethan vs you over a similar injury is just too stark not to get you thinking unhappy thoughts.

She insults you to manipulate you. I'm sorry noone could be bothered to challenge her obvious lies about you.", "Your parents are abusive.", "I know it can be really hard to say what you need to in an emotional situation with an older, more confident and assertive person actively trying to prevent you from sharing the information you need to share. That's not your fault and it's not a failure or a weakness on your part. Honestly, developing anxiety from being subjected to that kind of treatment *repeatedly* is probably one of the most predictable outcomes. Many of us would react the same way. \n\nI know that once you develop that immediate anxiety response it becomes a physical thing that you just can't stop even if you can manage to recognize what's happening and try to think calming thoughts. Are you able to get your thoughts out better in writing? Maybe when you're alone without your mother there interfering? If so, you could try writing out a statement to hand to your doctor. Take your time, write out multiple drafts, don't rush yourself, give yourself time to breathe and focus so that you can write the words your mother won't let you verbalize. Fold it up, hide it in your pocket, then give the statement to the doctor (or even better, hand it to the nurse who weighs you and takes your vitals and ask her to read it and share it with the doctor before she comes in to see you).\n\nWhat your mother is doing is abuse. She *knows* that what she's doing is horrifically unacceptable. The nurses and doctors see abuse and medical neglect as part of their jobs because it's sadly not uncommon. They will almost certainly pull your mother out of the room so you can speak with the doctor in private.", "This is disgustingly abusive. I\u2019m honestly so sickened by your mum here, especially that she\u2019s using your autism to gaslight you and to hide her abuse by making people not believe you. And she likes making it so you\u2019re forced to rely on her so you are trapped with her and her abuse. I\u2019m so sorry that your mum is like this.\n\nI know it\u2019s really hard (I\u2019m autistic too) but you really need to speak with a doctor privately. If you be honest with the receptionist when making an appointment they will be able to accommodate your autism and let the doctor be aware of your limitations, struggles etc. Also You are 17, you can talk to a doctor by yourself and the doctor cannot tell your mum unless you let them. (I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not in the US based on the language you use and appointments are free?)\n\nOr maybe if you\u2019re not ready to talk to a doctor is there a school professional or friend to talk to first, to build up your ability to talk to the doctor or they can help you? I really hope you manage to get help because honestly my heart broke reading your story. I\u2019m praying you get help, find your strength and get away from your abusers.\n\nEdit: I saw someone else mention that you could write your story out instead. That\u2019s a really good idea if it helps your anxiety! Maybe you could hand the letter to the doctor.", "My mom did that when I was 15.
