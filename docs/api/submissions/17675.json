I was put in a cast. \n\nWhen I was 8 again, I broke my elbow and after the x-ray was to go back to the hospital to get a cast on it. My mum never took me to the follow up appointment. I had to struggle for weeks with a bad elbow. \n\nWhen I was 10 I fell out of a tree and broke my shoulder blade. \nAgain the same thing, they refused to take me to hospital. \n\n\nNow to the story. \nSteve and ethan go to the same primary and they're a year below eachother. I'm going away on holiday soon and I was helping my mum out tiding her bedroom when she gets a call from the boys school.\n\"Ethans had a little bit of a nasty fall, he was climbing and fell out of a tree and landed wrong on his foot and can't walk\" \n\nThat's when all he'll set loose, my dad drove to their school and picked them up, mum was calling all my relatives and her friends \"ethans probably broken his foot\" \n\nWhen dad ethan and Steve got home mum went out to look at his foot and said \"nope go to hospital you need an x-ray\" \n\nAnd my heart broke. \nI just want to mention before I finish I have never and never will take out my pain on my brothers for something that is my parents fault. It's not their fault my parents treat me the way they do. \nHowever I told my friend and she told me I was being an asshole for getting upset and that I was making the situation about myself and that I should be worried about ethan.\n*another note: I was diagnosed with autism at 10 yrs old so I struggle with empathy as it is*\nI mean im not to say I'm not worried but I'm more hurt, watching the way my parents treat the boys like they're perfect and couldn't do wrong and me like I'm the worst person in the world hurts a little.

As long as you don't treat him negatively because of it then I'd definitely say nta, I'm sorry your parents didn't look after you, especially considering judging by the use of 'mum' you might be British and therefore they wouldn't have had to pay tonnes of money anyway (NHS) for the injuries.", "You parents ignored your pain and were neglectful in your care.\n\nYou deserved to go to the doctor each time you where several injured.

They clearly do not Gare about you.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  What your parents did, or should I say, DID NOT DO, borders on child abuse.", "NTA. Not your fault your parents clearly favour your brothers because they were born with penises.", "Maybe they understand their mistakes with you and are trying to do better.", "We've been throught that route however my mum never let's me talk to anybody to tell my side, she always speaks for me and now I've developed anxiety in speaking via phone or at Dr's so I have to rely on her quite a lot with that.

Both of them are very emotionally distant", "When I broke my ankle I was limping and when I did it the first time I screamed in pain? Isn't that enough indication something was seriously wrong?", "If your ten year-old fell out of a tree, wouldn't you want to get them checked out? And if you have a concern about a child being able to communicate, then you don't expect the 8 year-old to do much more than cry and be upset about it? If you are relying on a small child to be able express that they have broken bones, then going to miss a lot.", "I dont majorly reset them, it just hurts me, they've never attempted to apologise for the medical neglect I suffered and have hurt me to the point I don't tell anyone when I'm ill and push myself to the point I'm borderline unable to move", "While I see your point, that parents are learning too, I would say at best that goes NAH, though personally I lean toward NTA here, that sounds like fairly extreme neglect.  OP is certainly not an asshole for being hurt by this, and considering the number of bones she has broken, this probably isn't all that scary to her.", "That's your take?", "Not at all would I prefer them to be treated the same as me.

It is a basic requirement to get your children medical care and they have denied you that on three occasions. And now to hide their abuse, they are making sure you can talk to anyone without them being able to intercept and downplay your statements.  I'd be worried about brittle bones too. \n\nAs to a broad imagination, it is hard to imagine actual bones breaking and periods of pain where they weren't treated.  How they treat your brothers is how any injured child should be treated and a pretty low bar to meet. You need to talk to someone independent - are you at school/college? Do you have a trusted adult in your life? \n\nWhat are your plans for the next stage in your life? Because it would be best if you get away and find people who don'tdownplay your pain and treat you as the mature, caring person you are. And I'm sorry but I think you need to get that support outside your family.", "Yeah, NTA.
