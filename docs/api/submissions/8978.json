Because of the price difference between the two vacations we are only going for a week.  \n\nI told her about it and now she is pissed at me for cancelling the hotel and just taking her to New York.  She has been telling all the people at the school where she works how she is so brave for going to a third world country. How she was basically going to be staying in a hut.

I understand what others are saying about how you should have talked to her first. But after all that drama from her I don\u2019t think any change of heart would have made me feel comfortable bringing her home. What would her behavior have been like? I get the opinion that you should have told her, I just don\u2019t agree. I think planning the trip to New York was very nice of you.

Honestly, whether you have a kid with her or not, she is so classist/racist/elitist that you need to cut her loose.  Cancel the vacation.  Cancel the marriage.\nEdit - updated judgment", "NTA. All you can do is take what people say as what they mean. All you are hearing are these anxiety induced rantings. If you weren't doing anything instead of traveling to your homeland, then you would be tah. Since you have planned a getaway to NYC, I think you can consider yourself NTA", "ESH. I understand how annoying that must be, but communication is key. Sitting down, having a conversation about how much you dislike her comments about your home country, and telling her you were going to cancel the trip is all that needed to happen. Canceling it before discussing it with her was a mistake on your part.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, imo she's definitely worse for constantly trying to score sympathy points for months/years about it is definitely insensitive and ignorant to you. I don't think you're wrong for canceling the trip, just wrong for how you did it.", "Sorry to say ESH, mostly her but also you a bit.\n\nNot for being mad at her ridiculous carry on, which is insulting and ignorant and all that. \n\nBut for not speaking to her first and cancelling the trip before telling her. I get why you did it. But it hasn't achieved anything except venting your (understandable) anger. \n\nAlthough why you've spent 15 years with someone who is so disrepectful about where you're from, and your family, I do not know.", "ESH\nYou cancelled the vacation without asking her. That's a pretty big decision. Also, I suspect there was a little petty revenge for her behavior.\nShe's totally an AH. She continued to insult your home country in front of you, and lied about the circumstances to her co-workers. Now she claims that all the while she wanted to go.", "Unfortunately ~~E S H~~. Mostly her. Dumping on your spouse's homeland and pearl clutching are never good things. Add acting like a brave little soldier for going to said country, a being willing to weather the 'hardship' of staying in a very nice hotel and in your uncle very nice house. Her behavior about the whole thing was poor.\n\nThat said, you changed the plans for both of you without asking her. Even if it was to something she might like better, it still should have been a joint decision, or at least a discussion. That was rude of you.\n\nETA: changed judgment with more info. NTA", "NTA. I do understand why some folks are saying that you also suck, but honestly\u2026 how many more disparaging comments were you expected to take from your wife? Sure, you could have sat down and asked her beforehand, but she made her bed. \n\nAnd you even booked a new vacation! One that she presumably feels comfortable with (because NYC is soooooo safe! /s).", "NTA", "NTA. That was so profoundly disrespectful of her, and you even rescheduled a different trip. This behavior on her part is disturbing and xenophobic.

Unilaterally cancelling the vacation is not cool. \n\nThat said, I can't blame you and might have done the same thing myself. I imagine that your wife dissing your country of origin got old a long time ago. Publicly painting herself a a martyr over the proposed trip is a more than a little over the top. \n\nI see from the comments that you're from Colombia. Everything that I have heard or read about that country indicates that it has changed remarkably over the time you've been married. Many people unfortunately have trouble unlearning things that are no longer true.", "ESH\n\nUnilateral decisions like this are not good for any relationships.\n\nShe can still complain how scared and dangerous NY is, so it's not a total loss.", "ESH she sucks for spending 15+ years trashing your home country despite (I assume) you consistently refuting her prejudices. Continuing to spread these biases to other people in an attempt to make herself look brave and charitable is also pretty awful.\n\nThat being said, you should have talked to her before cancelling or altering the trip. A simple conversation where you say \u201cit really hurts the way that you speak about my home country and if you\u2019re still not comfortable with the trip then we can go somewhere else this year (or shorten our trip or change it to a 1 day stop on a cruise etc)\u201d if she says she doesn\u2019t want to change or cancel the trip then you ask her to stop speaking disparagingly about the country", "Esh is the only possible answer here to me, her for being herself and you for thinking you\u2019re entitled to make decisions for her.\n\nI also feel like it\u2019s pretty weird to be married to someone who feels that negatively about where you and your family come from. It feels micro aggressive and it doesn\u2019t feel like a first offense.", "ESH\n\nShe's an AH for being such a drama queen.  And the punchline is she's not really scared, she just wants the attention and praise for being \"so brave.\"\n\nYou for just cancelling things out of spite and anger.  And I get why you were tempted to do that, but why'd you replace that with a family trip to New York.  I'd have just asked her to either cut it out, or make her own vacation plans while I went home.  \n\nYou're all AHs and NO ONE is happy.  Ooof.", "ESH - Her behaviour sounds thoroughly obnoxious and bigoted, but equally I've no idea why you decided to go ahead and change everything at the drop of a hat without speaking to her about it.", "ESH she obviously overplayed the \u201cooh so scary\u201d part, but you also could have tried talking to her about it. Very childish on both sides", "ESH she needs to get a grip and get off her I'm so scared/it's so dangerous if it really isn't.

YOU: not communicating with her FIRST before cancelling everything.", "YTA. All you had to do was communicate with her. Tell her how her comments were becoming offensive and ask her if she wanted you to cancel the trip. If she said no, your condition would be that she cease the negative talk then.

When you have kids, are you goingt to let her treat your children like your origins are with rural people living off untouched society? This is so unacceptable. She's literally using a fake version of your home to make herself sound like a brave little white girl who married the savage out of love. \n\nThat's cringe even in the romance novels she probably reads.", "NTA should've just canceled hers and went by yourself", "ESH. Your wife was trying to get attention by making it seem like she was going to a third world country and staying in abject poverty, making her firmly an AH. You seem to have never communicated how uncomfortable this made you, but even if you had you changed the plans without discussing it with her at all, making you an AH.\n\nTry communicating.", "ESH- her because of her ignorance, you for taking the easy way out.\n\nFor people that haven't ever traveled outside of first world countries, the prospect can be daunting. The narratives that they imagine prior to their trip is very real to them, and informed mostly by media representation. I can understand your pique with her attitude, and why you cancelled the trip, but her fear is real, and the only way for her to get past it, is to go through it.", "NTA, but beware, your wife might like to show-off. This sometimes lead to stranger stories.", "[deleted]", "YTA.  Your wife was humblebragging for attention.  Best you can do now is point her to a bunch of websites about the rising crime in NYC.  She'll be able to save face that way.", "Yeah. We were going to stay in Medellin with family then head over to the Carribean coast and stay in the walled city in Cartagena.", "Honestly I don't get why so many are defending her and shitting on op. Her comments are very racist especially, basically staying in a hut", "Exactly. Telling people she\u2019s brave for going and they\u2019d be staying in a hut?! She\u2019s unhinged.

And our family comes up all the time and stay with us when they vacation in California.", "He\u2019s been telling her for 15 fucking years apparently", "She always puts vacation planning on me.  If it was up to her we would just go to New York every summer.", "OP should just drop her ungrateful ass off in Flint and enjoy a nice vacation himself.", "We both like New York.", "Two months of listening to her complain about the trip and say how she wasn't looking forward to it is not the drop of a hat.", "Spent fifteen years explaining how safe it is.  My bad for thinking that was enough.", "Yeah it's not like I spent nearly fifteen years convincing her it is a great place to visit. I wonder how she got the impression that all I wanted to hear about the trip was how she didn't want to go.", "I don\u2019t think she was actually scared though. She just liked the reactions of others when pretending like she was walking into a warzone or hanging in the slums.", "Sorry I thought that fifteen years of telling her it was safe and finally getting her to agree to go implied that I had spent fifteen years convincing her it was safe.", "Nope.\n\nOP, You are NTA.\n\nIf I spent a lot of money to take my partner on a trip and all they did was trash my home country and say stupid shit so people would pat their back because \"you're so brave!\", I'd cancel the vacation too.\n\nYour wife has done enough talking, 15 years of it, you don't owe her anything else.\n\nId still have went - without her.\n\nShe's not mad you canceled the trip, she's mad that she won't have the attention of everyone, now.", "She spent two months shitting on the trip.", "Why does this make OP the AH?", "I went to Cartagena with my parents when I was 12ish, I think. It's a beautiful city, but we were warned off certain areas. Like any large city. That was about 20 years ago, so I can only imagine how much safer it is now. Sounds like it would have been a great vacation if she had given it a chance.", "I\u2019m sorry your wife didn\u2019t go. I\u2019ll be visiting Cartagena next year on a cruise and I cannot wait. I also wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do a land vacay there and explore other parts of the country.", "Like wtf is her problem, how can you be married to someone for over 15 fucking years and not go to their home country, even then complaining for 2 whole months then get mad when he switches it out for something up her alley. Some people are just trash and some people view them jewels", "But you wont convince her if she never goes there. \n\nBest thing would have been to counter whatever she says to whoever with the good things. She moans about it and even her aunt telling her about going there didn\u2019t convince her. \n\nShe needs to see it to believe it and you just shut that down. \n\nBut also, shes pretty awful to disparage your home country so viciously when she hasnt ever been there.", "I don't even have that much family that I'm in contact with in the country my family is from, and I would not be able to tolerate someone who thinks (consciously or subconsciously) that the country my family is from is beneath them. Perhaps I'm projecting from my experiences of meeting people who believe other countries are inherently worse than theirs and have no interest in seeing the world beyond themselves. My experience is it's usually underpinned by racist beliefs they refuse to examine. What you allow is up to you but you're very valid in being fed up.", "It sounds like she's been complaining for 15 years and he hasn't voiced how much he dislikes that. Instead he's just been trying to change her mind and wear her down. Because I doubt he's been telling her how hurt he is by her comments for 25 years and she just keeps doing it and ignoring that", "Which is a very safe city. /s Actually, it's also better than it was 20 years ago. \n\nThat does change my opinion a bit, so you might want to include that. If her obviously preferred spot is NYC, and she's been fretting for months about the trip you planned, then switching makes sense. You still probably should have discussed it, but I'm revising my judgment.", "So, if she really was scared of going to your home country, cancelling and buying tickets to NYC would have rewarded her whining....\n\nOf course, it turns out she's probably not scared, just loves being a drama queen.  Fun!", "Making the decision unilaterally without consulting her is at the drop off a hat - at least as far as she's concerned. I totally understand why you did it, honestly what you've described sounds exhausting and as others have said I do wonder how you've managed to be married for 15 years if this is her level of respect and opinion for your home country. Regardless, it would have been better to communicate with her first.", "Info: Did you actually sit your wife down and have a conversation with her where you said her comments *about this trip* *specifically* were making you upset? I agree that she was being shitty, but canceling the trip is a really spiteful thing to do. (Yes, even if you replace the trip with one to New York.)", "Not that part, it sounds like you did communicate the realities of the country. I mean the part about cancelling it. You should have told her that it was upsetting you to the point that you\u2019d rather not go. It would have given her a final shot at making an adjustment in attitude.", "She sounds like she was trying to work through her anxiety verbally ahead of time. But you still need to tell her that it's annoying and offensive.\n\nYou sound like you've decided that 15 years of her bashing your home country is just about enough - I don't blame you for your feelings on that one, actually.", "They\u2019re right though, like did you ever actually communicate to your wife that her disparaging comments where affecting you? Sounds like you where just stewing while she was constantly talking about it. Why did you never chime in? Why did you never make it known that you where offended by her comments? Because it sounds like you want to punish your wife more than you want to go visit your family.", "Bingo", "I go all the time.", "DING DING DING! And we have a winner! I wonder if she is going to tell the reason as to why she isn't going on that \"dangerous\" trip anymore?", "You're NTA. I'd have done the same thing. She was using it to get attention from everyone and now has to eat crow, it's totally her own fault. I'm surprised you didn't just go on your own and are taking her on a trip to NY!", "The hotel we were staying in was no joke one of the swankiest things I've ever seen.", "The Fort and the Popola church are worth seeing.

Avoid the strip mall for souvenirs.", "I'm actually done.   I like New York.  Great restaurants.", "No I actually considered it for a while.  And it took me a few days to make sure I could get good tickets for the musicals she wants to see.  It wasn't a sour of the moment decision.  She wore me down.", "Yes", "Does a grown adult really need to be told that calling her husband's home country dangerous and that she's brave for going there is offensive though?

So she can heave an haw about how much she doesn\u2019t like it why don\u2019t you go by yourself and give yourself a vacation, honestly I would need a break with how \u201cme,me,me\u201d your partner is", "Yeah but there\u2019s something about seeing a foreign country with a native. \nThats when and how you see all the great local things on offer. \n\nIts just sad she wont experience that,especially with you, her H.", "Sure I get that, but if you've not communicated any of this with her then it still comes out of nowhere from her perspective, even if you've spent months/days deciding on it and planning the replacement.", "Honestly, neither really sounds like a grown adult.", "Thank you for taking the time to answer one question of my handful of questions. Would you like to answer the other ones? You cherry picked the one question that really didn\u2019t need much of an answer.", "Sure but you said I made the decision at the drop of a hat.  Not so.", "You seem really fucking annoying", "Happy to concede it wasn't at the drop off a hat. Equally, that doesn't change the issues around communication you both seem to be having.

But you should\u2019ve gone by yourself to see your family. \n\nHonestly, thank God she\u2019s not going because she seems to be one of those entitled tourists that consider locals to be inferior to them and just act plain stupid and offensive.
