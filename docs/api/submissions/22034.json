She\u2019ll drop them off for my wife to watch them and we\u2019ll notice them coughing or saying they feel like they\u2019re going to puke. When she comes to pick them up we\u2019ll bring it up and she\u2019ll be like \u201coh yea they\u2019ve been sick for a few days but they\u2019ll be better soon\u201d or something like that. It pissed me off before because she risked getting us sick but now that we have a newborn I told my wife that she and her kids aren\u2019t welcome at our house until our son is at least a year old because of things like RSV whooping cough etc. I told her that I\u2019m not risking my child\u2019s life because of her cousins irresponsibility.

This sort of stuff used to piss me right off when my kids were babies.", "A newborn doesn't \"meet\" anyone. That in itself is an idiotic cliche. Infants don't have the intellectual capacity to \"meet.\"\n\nAnd your wife seems strangely comfortable with these kids bringing disease into your house. And with the cousin's reckless attitude.\n\nSomething is really wrong over there.", "NTA\n\nThis is about the health of your newborn and her cousin is reckless and inconsiderate.\n\nDoes she believe in vaccines?  Just curious.\n\nETA not saying wife is ah(cousin is) but you need to get on same page as wife.  Or she'll just ignore you or go behind your back.", "NTA and I'm guessing they are anti-vaxx. Don't let them near a newborn. It is a chance worth taking. Protect your kid.", "Stand your ground. The lack of vaccines in some kids make them careers to disease that will infect and kill your son quickly. RSV, Whooping cough, measles and even polio is making a comeback. Cousin does t bring the kids to the dr so I assume the kids aren\u2019t fully vaccinated. \n\nThat\u2019s playing with the death of your baby. \n\nNta", "NTA\n\nand it left me stunned that your wife isn't putting the safety of your nowborn as her first priority.\n\nYour newborn has virtually no immunitary defences right now, and even a cold could be dangerous for them.", "Uh, I-n-f-o because I'm curious and not actually because I need it for judgment. Are her kids vaccinated?\n\nIf the details you've given are correct, NTA. Your wife's an Ah for disagreeing and potentially putting her kids life in danger. It's not like you've said no forever, a year old is a good idea if their sick so often and the sister would still come over anyway. However if they are as close as you say I would expect heavy pushback from your wife. I have non-family that are basically siblings to me, and while I wouldn't be your wife in this scenario (because no fucking way I'd risk my kids getting sick), if it was about something else I heavily disagree with I can fully see how she'd be willing to go behind your back for this or even go as far as divorce if you somehow stop that. \n\nYou need to get your wife to agree with you here or you need to find a way to compromise that keeps your kid safe, if you don't she will put your kids in danger. Not from malicious intent but because it sounds like she doesn't believe you or she feels she actually needs her cousins support around.", "NTA. If your wife wishes, your family can visit Plague Aunt so that you have the option to vet the situation and leave if it appears they're unwell: that's about the best compromise. It's also less likely to be a problem, because if she has sick kids she'll be less keen to have guests over to be entertained on her time than to dump them on someone else (ie you), so likely to be less secretive about their status.\n\nKids get sick. They're little pitri dishes. Even fully vaxed with a perfect immune system they appear to lick every surface or person they come in contact with by how much they get sick. It's mind blowing, honestly. And yeah, it can neuter the parent to 'just the sniffles' stuff because it's just Wednesday and shopping still needs done. But you need to be more careful around the fresh-baked one, so you're fine to set that rule and do what needs doing to make sure it's respected.", "INFO: did you initiate this conversation well in advance of the birth?\n\nIf so, NTA. If this was a surprise to your wife then ESH", "Are cousin & her kids vaxxed? If not, I'd change that from a year to whenever they are all fully vaxxed, with a minimum of a year to allow your baby to be vaxxed and develop a stronger immune system. NTA, but your wife is, big-time. How dare she put her cousin's convenience above her baby's health! If she lets cousin and/or her kids through the door, grab your baby and everything they'll need for at least 48 hours and leave immediately. Have a go bag ready with diapers, formula, clothes, etc. Tell your wife you'll be back after she's disinfected every room they enter. Did she learn *nothing* from the last few years?", "Nta\n\nYou have to take care of your own first. Be clear with he4 about this, and she needs to get on board.", "Your wife can go to them if they need babysitting if she cares so much. I\u2019ve seen very sick babies due to rsv/COVID/whooping cough-I work in a hospital. It\u2019s very scary to watch. Protect your kid.", "Your kid is going to be much sicker because of your germ-phobic attitude. Three months recommended. A year is ludicrously over protective.", "NTA evidently covid has taught us nothing. RSV can kill babies.", "NTA. And I cannot stress that enough. When my son was a month old he contracted rsv and basically died in my arms 3 times while I waited for the ambulance to show up. He was in the hospital, intubated with an IV in his foot, for a month. We were told by the doctor in the ER that if it had happened overnight we would have lost him. Anyone that would downplay or dismiss illness around adults would absolutely downplay or dismiss illness around a baby who isn't old enough for vaccines.. and up to date vaccines are the MINIMUM I would require for ANYONE, relative or not, to be around that baby.  Again in no world are you TA for wanting to protect your newborn.", "NTA. Her cousin has prove to be a liar and an irresponsible person. Ask directly to your wife: What it is more important you, our kid health or your cousin feelings? Or do you want to be just as irresponsible as her when it come to our child health? \n\nHold your ground and do best for your kid.", "Most start at 2 months, but there is no widely available vaccine for RSV which can absolutely be deadly to babies.\n\nThere is an RSV vaccine for preemies and babies with qualifying medical conditions, but it is a very short list and difficult to get approved through insurance sometimes.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "and there may have to be a prebuilt discussion with your wife about if she tries to hide cousin's kids being sick and around the baby what happens.\n\nyour child is an infant- they don't have her immune system. it's already tricky introducing small kids to babies- they're always going to full of germs, but add in a parent who has a history of sending over her actively sick children?\n\nyou may have to be prepared to go- if X happens, the baby and I will be moving out for the child's safety. this isn't about how much mom loves the baby but about her willingness to put the baby first.", "Have her read this post. Your not the ass for protecting your baby! However- you do know that they will be there when your working\u2026 NTA", "NTA!! Your baby's health comes before your wife's cousin's feelings. I understand your wife wants to show her baby to family and her cousin for wanting to see baby but with her history of not telling you when her kids are sick is just too risky. This might be harsh, but show your wife pictures of babies/kids in the hospital with RSV; my husband kept thinking it was no big deal until he saw a friend's post with pictures. Then he understood why I was so nervous about it.\nYou are doing a good job for looking after your baby's health. Just make sure you get your wife on board with you; is she one to sneak her cousin/kids over when you are at work? Or will she bring baby to their house if she is out by herself with baby?", "NTA.  She can be mad all she wants, but she needs to understand that you have a baby now, and he comes first.  Her cousin has repeatedly brought sick children over to your house zero regard for you and your wife's health, and there's every reason to think that she's going to show the same disregard for your son.", "Uh, there are times when I feel like I've gone through the looking glass and this is one of them.  You will learn as your children grow that they catch stuff.  It's how immune systems work.  Kids just constantly have stuff, and parents get used to it.  Your characterization of your wife's cousin is comical.  She's used to it, and in a few short years you will be too.\n\nYour baby's immune system gets a jump start from your wife, and as your baby grows and receives vaccines (and catches things) their immune system will develop.  Not only can you literally not protect your kid from catching stuff (unless you want to keep them in a bubble) it would not be beneficial for them if you did.  \n\nYour wife's cousin's kids are no different from any other kids.  When you have a second kid will you seclude your second baby from your first kid, who by that time will be a germ factory just like any other kid?  \n\nI get being worried as a new parent.  But yeah, you're kind of being a dick.  YTA", "I have a six month old baby and when I left the hospital, the doctor reminded me that BOTH myself and the baby have no immune system for the first couple of months. And we are six months in and I\u2019m still protective of germs around him. \n\nRemind your wife that YOUR family and their health (both her and the baby) matter more than any social obligation. \n\nYour wife sounds like she is in the FOG (Fear, Obligation, Guilt) with her cousin. The first time my cousin pulled a trickery move like dropping off a sick kid to be babysat would be the LAST time. \n\nNTA"]}
