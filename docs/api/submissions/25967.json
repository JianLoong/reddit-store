But, although this hit you as an insult, you were not the only target.", "You didn\u2019t say anything to FIL or comment on his remark. All you did was get up and go to the bathroom. Your husband decided to take you home. How is this your fault? What are you supposed to apologize for? And your husband told his father he needed to apologize first, which is great because he stood up for you. But even if he apologizes first, what did you do? Maybe you had to change your tampon for crying out loud. Hopefully no one apologizes, and you never have to see these people again.", "NTA \n\nMy step dad is a narcissist prick too, he knew what he was saying.  He's been diminutive of me since I was 4.  Said goodbye today when he said what I've poured my heart into was a silly toy.  These people would rather double down on their ignorance than ever admit they're wrong.  I'm done saying \"Daddy come play with me.\"  Sometimes I wish i hadn't tried so hard to be his son, wasted energy.\n\nAll that to say, ask your husband if he's worth the heartache?", "SAH - I don\u2019t see anything the matter with the FIL comment. He was a player and probably the people he had his sights on are the ones he knew would fall all over him. Who is your target group when you are young is not who you are when you grow up. I think this could be considered a compliment and you should say I\u2019m sorry because I took it as you insulting me, now I realized I shouldn\u2019t have.

Its insulting and embarrassing for your husband and yourself to have to be reminded of those times for no reason. What he said was completely unnecessary and he should apologize. Though, if I'm being honest, I think leaving for the bathroom was a bit much on your part. I feel like you should have communicated at the table that what he was saying was insulting. By leaving the table and consequently the dinner, I don't think your FIL learned anything from his actions and probably just thinks you were throwing a tantrum which obviously you weren't. I also don't think he meant to hurt you, he was being ignorant and verbally impulsive without regard to your feelings but from what it sounds like he wasn't being intentionally hateful. It seems like a very dramatic reason on both sides to cut each other off. This would heavily impact your husband and its immature on both of your parts to let something like this ruin your relationship. While you're not the asshole in any way, the best solution in my opinion would be to apologize to the dad for leaving but also stand your ground and tell him that what he said was horrible and that you expect an apology as well. Not because you're in the wrong but because its the mature way to handle things and for the sake of your husbands relationship with his family, it would also teach your FIL that his words have impact.", "OP,\n\nFIL\u2019s seem to have that disconnect between foot and mouth.

Absolutely. Was your reactions a bit dramatic? 100%. \n\nWho gives a shit about the HS stuff? You got the man. And if you're being honest with yourself, you can probably agree with FIL. Not because of YOU or how you looked or any of that BS, but because of your husband. If he was such a louse in HS, would you have even wanted to date him? Probably not. And that should have been what you said and focused on. \n\nBut should you apologize to them? No. Your husband picked you--again. He came to get you and told you that you were leaving. Your husband then defended you and insisted that your FIL apologize first. Clearly, he knows that they were wrong. If the rest of them can't wrap their heads around their own stupidity, then fuck em. \n\nBut I'm going to go a step further and suggest some therapy or self-improvement books, maybe some journaling or something. You obviously have some self-esteem and self-worth triggers you need to work on. \n\nDo I think it's silly how you reacted to a comment that was meh, about your HS self that doesn't exist anymore?

Whether or not it was true, it's not something they ever should have said out loud to you. Very tacky.

Very glad that your husband sided with you!", "This is not exactly an YTA/NTA response, but I think you did fine. You guys aren\u2019t exactly kids anymore. Some guys are enriched and uplifted by the relationships they have with their parents, especially heteronormative mother/father dynamics. However, it\u2019s really common for a man to have a rocky parental relationship and grow up and away from his parents to seek independence. You should seriously ask your husband how he feels about his relationship with his parents. \n\nI want to be clear, if you take any advice from this comment, do not ask your husband leading or ominous questions. \n\nTry and think like a therapist, draw out information by taking small bites. It\u2019s completely up to you wether to forgive without apology or hold your ground,you\u2019re justified in your decision. However you might value the love and positive (or negative) energy they bring to your husbands life, and if he would suffer as a person if you put him in a hard position like that.

Your husband seemed to support you and that's good.  You'd been insulted and your husband decided it best to leave.  Good for him.  What is his take on all this?  \n\nI wouldn't be moved by anyone's threats.  Hopefully, you and your husband will decide together how to handle this situation.", "NTA, but toughen up.", "NTA. The fact that SIL texted you isn\u2019t a good sign. Some families are close to the point that they get deluded that none of them can possibly be wrong so it\u2019s always the outsider. Just ignore it and let a few weeks go by. FIL will hopefully see the error in his ways, and if it affects the relationship long term then that\u2019s on him.", "The best response in that situation is a laugh - and tell him that before their son matured, he", "You seem very thin skinned. What was upsetting about his comment? YTA", "NTA but I think the misunderstanding was that he was a player in HS and went with girls who slept around, not with girls who were pretty. Saying he never thought he\u2019d end up with someone like her, not his type, probably meant he thought she was too good for him not the other way around. But if that\u2019s true they need to explain that first and apologize for creating the misunderstanding before you apologize back.", "NTA - People who hate and claim the victim when called out rile me up to no end.  You DEMAND an apology from FIL and maybe, just maybe you'll let him see his future grandkids. But you'll see about that.  But no way you are apologizing to the misogynistic AH. Ever.  You have to set the boundaries early and make them stick.", "You are not an AH. The comment would not have phased me because I always thought I was an acquired taste and preferred being cared for because of my personality and not my looks.  One of the most hurtful things an ex boyfriend ever told me was that he was more attracted to my looks than my personality.  kt", "NTA. Your husband is responsible for his actions and his choices, and he took the right actions and made the right choices here.", "Never apologize", "UGH. I hate it when people try guilt trip others. First off: Your feelings are legitimate. And, as far as you handled it, you could have done a lot worse than excusing herself and going to the bathroom. It's not like you flipped the table, cursed them out, and pimp-walked out of there.\n\nIgnore your SIL's attempts at guilt tripping you. Your husband is his own man with full autonomy. You do not dictate his behavior. And SIL is mad because what? Her brother is being a good husband and supporting his spouse?\n\nIf your husband's relation with his parents is at risk over something this minor that's on them. This is a ridiculous hill to die on and they should just apologize.\n\nKudos to your husband for supporting you though.", "Plot twist.... Was husband into guys in high school?", "NTA & I applaud your husband for having you\u2019re back OP that means you mean everything to him. Please ignore your in laws. FIL is playing the victim & MIL and SIL are just enablers.", "Right? Because for the life of me, I can't figure out why OP has anything to apologize for?", "Yeah - an apology is not enough now that FIL has made his option crystal clear and Op will always know that when she sees the FIL. And the fact that the FIL didn\u2019t immediately apologize and, much worse, wants OP to apologize means he truly doesn\u2019t understand the cruelty behind his words.

I mena it sounds vaguely negative but only cuz why talk about that in the first place. But he said it's not about being pretty so what *is* it about? Is it like \"He used to only date blondes and you're a brunette\"?", "Maybe he likes Latinas, and she's white. Doesn't make it right but I mean he might have thought he was polite not saying what exactly was different. Some people are just awkward, but they would have to be willing to apologize for offending her for that to be the case.", "I also feel like there's some emotional manipulation on the family side...like, really? Is your family structure so fragile that one falling-out is going to threaten all these relationships? I feel like healthy families talk about things and figure out how to move forward.  If his family falls apart over FIL being a dick and refusing to own it, then that may be a good indicator that the couple doesn't need those folks in their lives.", "The parents would probably care first on this one. Especially because their son is on his wife's side.", "You\u2019re a bloody poet and I wish I could upvote this again and again\u2026", "She probably wasn't told the correct story. I doubt she heard that FIL basically called her ugly or boring looking. She heart it secondhand from the parents and of course they will make themselves look good.", "No that would be way too rational for their brains to conceptualize. \ud83d\ude02 I would just text back \u201cWrong number.\u201d *block* and have fianc\u00e9 deal with it", "I'm sorry I let you insult me.  I made a mistake in that respect, but now I realise that I should never, ever listen to anything you say.", "This ^ bahahahha", "Wait, walking away for a few minutes is overreacting? In what world does that make sense? And it does affect the husband, considering he's the one who decided they should leave, not her. But you really need to get your priorities straight if you think that going into the bathroom for a few minutes is overreacting.", "Yeah I have terrible social skills so idk if I'm missing something here...it sounds like FIL just meant OP wasn't his son's type in high school?", "Walking away and going into the restroom is not a bad reaction, and it most certainly isn't childish. The in-laws demanding an apology for something as small as walking away for a few minutes, however, is extremely childish. Insult or not, what she did is hardly something that warrants an apology.", "How is going into the bathroom for five minutes over the top and immature?", "Get a grip. This was anything but harmless. It was insulting plain and simple", "You\u2019re kind of a piece of work\u2026 Your preface is that it doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says if it\u2019s not true and peoples words shouldn\u2019t bother you if you don\u2019t think it should bother them.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is just your opinion. Words spoken with specific intention can cause harm may be the father-in-law meant to be an EH, or maybe he didn\u2019t, but either way his words were unkind, and she has a right to feel how she feels.", "Not an overreaction, just walking away for a few minutes.", "OP isn't the one threatening possible disowning. The parents are the ones throwing a fit and demanding an apology for her leaving the table for five minutes after the FIL technically insulted her. I mean, thicker skin may be good to have, but her reaction was not bad enough to warrant an apology being demanded.", "If his parents would disown him for this they are so shitty that they should not be part of his life anyway. She doesn't need to take shit just to make an old h feel good.", "Father in law\u2019s", "Yes they did. They were rude and he was absolutely insinuating she was less pretty than the HS girls the husband was with. And then he knew he messed up and tried to back pedal. AH behavior.", "The in-laws demanding an apology doesn't make the OP an asshole, just the in-laws.", "well if she is THEIR family now maybe they shouldn\u2019t INSULT HER LOOKS", "Talk it out? They are demanding, not asking, *demanding* an apology for her going into a bathroom for a few minutes in response to what he said. If they apologize for what was said and demanding that apology from her, then maybe I could see talking it out. But so long as they believe that they have the right to force her to apologize, they aren't liable to be the ones willing to talk it out without manipulation.", "Even if it wasn't an insult, she just went to the restroom. That's hardly something to apologize for. The husband arguably had a worse reaction to his father's lack of filter than her. Insult or no insult, the OP shouldn't have to apologize.", "he doesn\u2019t drink so no, no drinks", "You hid in the bathroom and your husband knocked the door to TELL YOU YOU WERE LEAVING. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe He\u2019s 100% on your side. Good for you both. Your in laws need to show you some respect.", "Honestly, let your husband handle this. He has the pull and he knows these people. He's supporting you. He can take it from here. Your in-laws are trying to make it your problem, but it isn't.", "If you are more worried about your husband being hurt, that shows a lot. Your inlaws are clueless. You have character and class, while they lack both. You did nothing wrong going to the restroom to collect yourself.", "I don't understand what they think you need to apologize for. Your reaction was the opposite of childish. You got up and removed yourself from the situation calmly. If I'm reading this correctly you weren't even the one who insisted on leaving. You did absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nI would absolutely refuse to apologize no matter what they say from here on out.\n\nAnd your SIL should be addressing your husband or their parents. Not you.\n\nIn the future, there's no reason why he can't go see them without you if you're uncomfortable around them but he still wants to go. Make it a girls' night or something.", "I'm glad your hubby has your back and I hope you realise you weren't the only victim here. While you were the main victim, your FILs comments about your appearance were also an insult to your husband and a commentary on what FIL thinks about your husbands \"type\". That might help you to understand why your husband is taking it the way he is. He was insulted and his wife was insulted and you two are a couple.", "\"I'm sorry you have no human decency and think that I need to apologise because you think its okay to go put me down and insult me. Unfortunately I dont accept being hurt by people for their own fun\"", "Your husband made the choice to leave. *He* decided this was worth drawing a line over.

OP I LOVE THIS FOR YOU!! \n\nYou\u2019re husband backed you up without prompting and made sure he centered you and his commitment to you with his family!

I\u2019m not even religious, but congrats to you and your husband for being a great couple!", "I\u2019m glad to hear you say that because it will. Your husband can\u2019t help what his family is like\u2026unfortunately. He certainly can\u2019t change his dad after all these years. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been that rude AH forever. I would try to steer clear of asking him any questions for now on and try and ignore him or take it personally. Try and limit contact as much as possible. Your husband will see what a strong mature woman you are to handle his family\u2026I know he\u2019ll appreciate it.", "if yo love him that much and are willing to eat crow but it seems he already has your back then together make a decision how you will both react and act... stronger together...", "I think your husband\u2019s response was appropriate and supportive of you\u2026 You said to Boundary about not wanting to stay present, if your father-in-law or someone else in the family is making unkind statements, and I think you and your husband really need to stay united on this, and let the family know that if people are going to make unkind comments, you won\u2019t be present and no, you don\u2019t owe him an apology it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nOlder parents, sometimes still, to this day, seem to think that simply being adult and being a parent means you get some magic respect points and that they can say or do anything, but they still get to assume that you\u2019re going to treat them with deference.\n\nI think it\u2019s really important that you and your husband continue to talk about family, and how to manage healthy, supportive boundaries with family . It sounds like his family is used to saying whatever they feel like saying\u2026 Or at least the father-in-law does, and I think they need to really understand that for you to be involved with family he doesn\u2019t get to say shitty things to you.\n\nNTA", "Uhhhh, neither you nor your husband did anything wrong.  The bad behavior by your FIL, and the caping from his wife and daughter, is pretty shameful.\n\nGood for your husband for standing with you as a family.\n\nThe in-laws believing that shitty behavior is acceptable, and that, if they get pushback, they can act like a pack to force compliance, is just bullshit.  \n\nListen - they either learn to behave in a manner that isn't offensive to you and/or your husband, or they can fuck off.  Any other way forward is just asking for more abuse, because you would have both condoned it by apologizing to the offenders.  \n\nHave a productive conversation with your husband about his, and your, honest feelings about this situation, and then proceed forward as a couple.  \n\nAgain, neither of you have done anything wrong - you are simply forced to deal with this bad behavior, and are forced to set some boundaries.  \n\nNTA", "The way your husband reacted, it feels like this wasn't the first time. That was a \"last straw\" type of reaction. Honestly, if my parents behaved like that toward my husband, I wouldn't want to spend much time with them. It's possible that he's fed up with this type of toxic behavior, and refuses to deal with it - and good for him, if that's the case. If he decides he doesn't want to have much to do with them, that's his decision to make. If this type of behavior from them is common, I'm sure he's already weighed the long term consequences in his head before he made that decision.", "Your husband may be more forgiving than I am.  I'm fairly close to both of my parents and they will even ask my advice on things.  But in this situation I would wall them the fuck off for doing that to my wife.\n\nYour husband shut that shit down within 5 minutes.  He's made his choice, and it's you, and it's the same choice I would've made.  Don't punish yourself for your FIL's actions and words.", "NTA. But as someone with difficult parents who don't like my partner, yes, this will hurt him but that is because of his PARENTS. And to be honest, it doesn't really matter what you do anyway. And by that, I mean even if you apologized (which you shouldn't!) or played nice, he still knows what his parents think and how they behave.
