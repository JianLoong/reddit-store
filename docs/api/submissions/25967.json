There's no confusion on his intent.", "You sat there, didn\u2019t say anything, and took the FIL\u2019s word vomit.  You owe no one an apology!!!", "If at all. Well said.\n\nNTA", "It seems like they thought the best defense was to go on the offensive. After being offensive.", "Saying you weren't your husband's type when he was younger is not an insult.", "He was saying that OP was unattractive. He was openly insulting her looks. Why should she take that? Something is seriously wrong with FIL and MIL. FIL wanted to hurt OP. That is not harmless.", "That\u2019s not a compliment? \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have caught his eye but once he got to know your personality that wouldn\u2019t matter.\u201d No one wants to hear that their personality makes up for their looks? FIL basically said he dated way hotter girls (in FILs opinion-also gross) in high school and the husband settled for OP. Not saying it\u2019s true but that\u2019s exactly how he meant it which is screwed up and just unnecessary to say", "His parents don\u2019t know what I was like in High School tho, so they wouldn\u2019t know whether I was a partier or not", "Probably not. If that\u2019s what he meant, he could\u2019ve just said that. The fact that he wouldn\u2019t plainly say what he meant doesn\u2019t really make me think he was trying to say something nice to OP\u2026", "Why do you automatically think all these girls were slutty? The husband was described as a player, aka he played girls. Sluts don\u2019t get played. He meant they look different than OP and he didn\u2019t mean it kindly to her", "I feel like there were no reasons for those comments. Nobody asked him anything", "Bull. Thick skin, thin skin, whatever. FIL wanted OP to feel badly about her looks. No one has to take it from that old fool, his addled wife, or the snotty SIL. \n\nThis is the in-laws\u2019 passive aggressive way of telling OP how little they think of her. Glad her husband doesn\u2019t take after the rest of them.", "> I think she has thin skin and should have said \" well I've certainly got his eye now\" wink wink and laughed\n\n\n\nWhatever. \n\nThink skin, thick skin... How thick is the FIL that even despite warning from his wife and son, he thought this was a good dinner conversation? \n\nYou can wink and laugh. Op removed herself from the situation.", "Hmm let\u2019s have your FIL tell you his son settled for you and see how you react to that one", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "It sounds like your husband has your back, which he should. I wouldn\u2019t want to go back to my parent\u2019s house if they treated my wife like that. Your FIL is playing the victim. Don\u2019t let them twist this like that.\n\nCall him and tell him you want to apologize for bringing out the worst in him, and then tell him to fuck off.", "So your in-laws were hurling indirect insults and you need to apologize? Truth is, if there is going to be any moving forward, your in-laws need to apologize to you and your husband. Your husband has your back and made it clear that crossing certain lines will not be tolerated. \n\nWhile it's important to keep family relationships from disintegrating, why would your husband want to be around family members who openly insult you. An affront to you is an affront to him. The sooner your in-laws understand this and apologize, the sooner everyone can move forward. If it's the hill they choose to die on, then that's *their* decision. Good luck OP", "Kudos for your husband tho, I know it seems like the bare minimum but I read so many men not supporting their wives that him leaving the table and asking for respect for you it's nice to read", "What FIL said to you was insulting, hurtful and demeaning. You owe them nothing. I'm so sorry you went through that.", "You're wise. It is going to hurt him for sure.\n\nIf you guys can think of an authentic, ethical, and loving way to repair his relationship with his parents, that would be a noble and good thing to do. It is objectively better to heal a bad person and make them lovable than to leave them in their badness.\n\nBut appeasing bad behavior won't change them and it won't be good for your husband. That's the only option THEY have offered you.", "Don\u2019t apologize, tell your fil to go fuck himself, and leave it at that, assert dominance, should have been done in the first place, but it\u2019s never too late", "I love that you appreciate that your husband\u2019s relationship with his FOO is important. But honestly, I don\u2019t think you did anything you need to/should apologize for. You were hurt, FFS! If you don\u2019t expect an apology, fine. But why in the world should **you** be expected to apologize for needing time alone after being insulted in front of your husband\u2019s family??? What a strange situation. NTA.", "As others noted your husband has your back. \n\nDiscuss with him and work with him to decide next steps as they are his parents. \n\nIf you have to apologize my petty self would probably apologize for being offended by such a juvenile comment.  But then I\u2019m a fossil whose give a crap button broke and ran screaming so my filters might be missing.", "NTA.  His sister needs to mind her own business.  This is all on FIL.  He owes you an apology, not the other way around.  What are you supposed to do, just sit there and take whatever some one says to you, because their your in-laws?  I thinks not.", "Here\u2019s the thing - this is temporary. Either you stand up to them and they back down or you don\u2019t stand up to them and *you* back down. \n\nFirst option, they respect your boundaries and stop being so obnoxious. Second, you sign up for a lifetime of worse and worse behavior, making you unhappy and driving a deeper dagger into your husband. \n\nIf they were gonna go NC over this they wouldn\u2019t be panicking and neither would you SIL. Hold your ground, it\u2019ll be fine.", "I wonder why your in-laws were willing to risk their relationship with DH. It\u2019s not about you or DH, it\u2019s all on your in-laws.", "Saying you would never have caught his eye and he settled for someone like you is", "No, but they do know who he used to bring home and I\u2019m giving you the benefit of the doubt that you behave better than a horny teenager.", "> I asked him what he meant by that\n\nI mean, the tone of the moment felt insulting, I agree, but I thought you asked him?", "I literally said his comment wasn\u2019t okay. \n\nAnd since you want to focus on no one asking him anything, then you need to be mad at MIL too because she brought it up in the first place and no one asked her about his high school days, now did they?", "OP I love the wording that SupVFace recommended. \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "Exactly. People who genuinely weren't trying to hurt OP would instantly apologize on the spot and beg for forgiveness. But these people want an apology from her.", "I'd text SIL that her parents need to learn how go behave. This is not a discussion, they apologise, end of. She clearly didn't learn manners from them either.", "Not really, no.", "not so fast, he said she wouldn't apologize until FIL apologized, to me she doesn't need to apologize for leaving the table, at all.", "He said settled down with, not settled for... Those are very different things.", "I was, but like I said, thinking that he meant my husband wouldn\u2019t have looked at me because I wasn\u2019t much of a partier or my personality wasn\u2019t the same as him wouldn\u2019t be right as they didn\u2019t know what I was like in High School", "I meant the first comment. There were no reasons to start on that, he could\u2019ve been like \"Me neither, but we\u2019re glad he did\" or whatever", "Except she didn\u2019t brought up that my husband wouldn\u2019t have dated me, just that she didn\u2019t see him settling down. \n\nI never said you said it was okay", "To me this sounds more like a negative comment on who husband used to date rather than a negative comment about you.", "Yeah, they know what you're like now and that's the comparison. If you had been as you are now in HS, the person your husband was in HS might not have been into you. And maybe vice versa. There's nothing wrong with that. Most people change pretty significantly from who they were in high school. The important thing is that you two found each other at the right time in both of your lives to fall in love and decide to grow into the people you'll be in the future together.", "Yeah, I can agree with that. From the context, I assume that his tone indicated he thought it was a bad thing or he's given you reason to believe he doesn't like you? But I'm basing that on your reaction when maybe I should be asking about what your relationship has been like with him? Has he given you the impression that he doesn't think you're a great partner or he doesn't think much of you? That's the filter *I'm* giving him based on your post, but I'm trying to pull back on that and focus on what was actually said. And has your husband's \"player past\" never come up before or is this a constant insinuation but the first time your FIL has ever put anything into words about it?", "She brought up his high school days. His commented related to that. He was trying to be a part of the conversation, which is normal behavior. He just did so in a crappy manner.", "Yeah I think I\u2019d agree\u2026 another follow up could have been \u201cwhy wouldn\u2019t I have caught his eye?\u201d", "I think he just doesn\u2019t care about me, when we see each other, I\u2019m mostly talking my MIL, if we have conversations he keeps them short, maybe that\u2019s just how he is to be honest so I don\u2019t necessarily take that in a he doesn\u2019t like me way. \n\nI don\u2019t really know how to describe his tone honestly,he was saying them in a way that would soften the blow, you know? I don\u2019t know how to describe it but it didn\u2019t felt like a \"you were too good for him\" or whatever", "It had nothing to do with her being a good enough partner it was definitely all about her looks", "Well he could\u2019ve restrained himself. Especially after both MIL and husband ask him not to", "Well, I already basically said that, now didn\u2019t I?", "I\u2019m just answering you, sorry if you don\u2019t like them"]}
