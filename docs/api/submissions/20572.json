Usually she is \"forced\" (that's what they call it) to do doubles so she's been leaving for work at 5:30pm and getting home between 10:30am and 12:30pm. She has one child (8f) and a husband at home. Her husband is a \"content creator\". As in sits on his ass making streams of him playing video games all day every day for his 12 followers.

I work, she stays home and raises our kids. We split house chores. She does hobby work that she gets paid for but she has ADHD so it's always changing (one month it's knitting blankets, the next it's making jewelry, the next it's flipping furniture). She involves our kids in it and they get paid for it so it's a cool system she has set up and I think it's fantastic. But lately she's stopped doing hobby work because of the pregnancy and being tired a lot. This pregnancy has been on the difficult side. Lots of swelling, a lot more fatigue than the other pregnancies, round ligament pain often and her emotions are a bit all over the place.

My wife said no. My niece has ADHD (unmedicated) and my wife is already too tired. When my sister left she was apparently in hysterics and accusing my wife of \"not knowing what it feels like\" to be that burnt out and needing help, but having no one. My wife was very overemotional about it when I got home and I immediately called my sister and told her she had no right to guilt my pregnant and exhausted wife in to watching her kid for her and that it's not our fault she works the way she does.

OP's sister is essentially a single parent, and regardless of what OP or wife thinks she has done to change the situation with her shitty partner, the situation is that she is the only responsible parent for their kid, and she reached out for help, and in desperation (setting a \"you made your bed\" response as standard could well mean she will stay longer stuck in the abusive relationship because she can't see a way out without help, and help, she knows, is unavailable to her\".\n\nSure she may have had a better person to ask for help than OP's wife (asking OP themselves would have been a bit more appropriate, but ofc this is a couples decision if they would share the labour); but she also just may not have had anyone else who would be at all capable of helping her, and that situation very much sicks for her and the kid involved.\n\nCan't get blood from a stone, ofc, so if it's not possible for OP and/or wife to help, \"no\" is a complete sentence/answer, but I would see her relationship as an abusive one and that would inform how I tackle the problem. If she wont get help from him in any way, then I would view it as single parent sister asking for a hand. \n\nI feel like there is a workable solution to help without hindrance, like maybe OP could take the kid in the evenings on her days off and have a sleepover so at least sister could get some unbroken sleep for those hours, and wife knows she is not on call for the extra kid (or stuck alone with their others); or OP could drive the kid to another sibling/aunt/uncle/grandparents house for the couple of days.\n\nI would struggle to leave a kid in the care of someone who is burnt out and another who las long checked out; so if it was possible to do something small to help sister a little, I would like to think i would figure something out.\n\nAside from all else and this instance, I hope sister could and would contact OP for assistance and support to leave her partner, as I expect this is on the cards (and maybe would be more if an exit seemed accessible). If this is the case and OP would/could help her leave him, it might be helpful for OP to tell her this in a quieter moment (where she wont use it for support from her partner against OP) where it can be accepted as a genuine offer and even if she is not ready now, kept in the back pocket for when she is able.", "On top of twitch not doing so hot right now, most streamers never make it past a single digits number of viewers.
