{"id": 20572, "submission_id": "14itay4", "title": "AITA for taking my wife's side against my overworked and burnt out sister?", "selftext": "My sister (46f) works as a police dispatcher on the overnight shift. Usually she is \"forced\" (that's what they call it) to do doubles so she's been leaving for work at 5:30pm and getting home between 10:30am and 12:30pm. She has one child (8f) and a husband at home. Her husband is a \"content creator\". As in sits on his ass making streams of him playing video games all day every day for his 12 followers. He makes roughly $200 a month in tips but my sister fully believes in him and supports it because this is what he desires to do. Commendable but whatever. My sister is completely burnt out. Like to a point of crying constantly burnt out. \n\nNow on to my wife. She's a SAHM to our children and she's currently pregnant. The dynamic works perfectly for us. I work, she stays home and raises our kids. We split house chores. She does hobby work that she gets paid for but she has ADHD so it's always changing (one month it's knitting blankets, the next it's making jewelry, the next it's flipping furniture). She involves our kids in it and they get paid for it so it's a cool system she has set up and I think it's fantastic. But lately she's stopped doing hobby work because of the pregnancy and being tired a lot. This pregnancy has been on the difficult side. Lots of swelling, a lot more fatigue than the other pregnancies, round ligament pain often and her emotions are a bit all over the place. I've been doing all the house work for about a month now and taking the kids off her hands fully as soon as I get home from work because she is just so tired and in pain. \n\nWell, when I was at work yesterday my sister had apparently come over and through tears begged my wife to take her daughter for a couple days so she could sleep, as apparently she had been approved for a couple days off. My wife said no. My niece has ADHD (unmedicated) and my wife is already too tired. When my sister left she was apparently in hysterics and accusing my wife of \"not knowing what it feels like\" to be that burnt out and needing help, but having no one. My wife was very overemotional about it when I got home and I immediately called my sister and told her she had no right to guilt my pregnant and exhausted wife in to watching her kid for her and that it's not our fault she works the way she does. She's blocked us all off everything.

That's too bad.\n\nNta", "NTA. First off, who would expect someone to take their kid for *days, plural* without even calling to ask? Not so much as a hey would this be ok before showing up on your doorstep? And your sister says she has no one, but that is because she apparently feels more comfortable asking her pregnant SIL to watch her kid than asking the child\u2019s own father. She does have someone, someone she lives with who actually is legally and morally responsible for this child, unlike your wife.", "NTA\n\nYour sister has chosen to stay married to her husband, working herself into exhaustion, so he can play video games for ***$200.a.month.***\n\nNot your problem.  Not your wife's problem.\n\nI hope the pregnancy symptoms settle down.\n\nHugs", "NTA Police dispatch is a stressful job. You can get nothing but routine calls for hours and then all hell breaks loose. And I am sure she's tired if she's working mandatory overtime. It's not a job you can walk off when your shift is done, if the department needs coverage, you are ordered in or held over. However, it does not entitle her to try and dump her child off on your pregnant wife and insult her because she can not accommodate her request. If she wants to let her husband sit on his backside all day long and chase a dream, it's a dynamic of their relationship. Your sister's tantrum was inexcusable.", "NTA. At all. You both have no obligation to watch SOMEONE ELSES kid. Especially when she's already pregnant and watching her own kids. If your sister believes she can't take care of her children because her husband won't step up, she needs to get divorced or work that out with him, not put the burden on someone else.", "NTA. I feel sorry for your sister, but it\u2019s not your wife\u2019s responsibility to handle childcare when her husband is at home live-streaming or whatever it is. I get wanting to have days off from your kids, but how much time do they normally get to spend together? Because it seems like she\u2019s barely ever at home.", "NTA - Your sister needs to get her husband to contribute. She isn\u2019t entitled to your wife\u2019s time. Your wife isn\u2019t her servant.", "NTA\n\nYour sister made a cry for help in a unique way. Your wife had a predictable response.  This one is messed up all around. Personally I'd go and, umm, encourage the slacker husband to do more in life. For what that's worth.", "NTA why tf can't the her husband watch his child so his wife can sleep?", "NTA. Instead of guilt tripping your wife, your sister needs to lay into her husband.", "NTA. Tell her husband to help.", "NTA\n\nSister has it rough, but her anger is misplaced. Dad needs to parent his kid.", "NTA. Your sister should be having a serious talk with her husband, not pressuring and guilting your pregnant wife.", "NTA. Your sister and her husband need to reevaluate their dynamic moving forward, especially as their children get older. Unless a miracle happens and he becomes a superstar overnight, your sister will continue to be overworked and undervalued. You defended your wife, the mother of your kids, and the health of your unborn child. Take care of your family, and I hope your sister eventually gets the support she needs from her partner.", "NTA\n\nSis and her husband need to wake up to reality. He is the one who should be supporting her and taking care of the kids so she can sleep.", "Ive been burned out like that so I sympathize with how your sister must feel, but nta.

Your sister's husband is... Um.. he can't watch his own kids?", "NAH\n\nBoth your wife and sister are overwhelmed so I am not going to call them assholes. Sleep deprivation is real.\n\nHere is my solution: husband creates content of the kid learning to play the video game. Keeps kid occupied for a couple days. Normally kids shouldn\u2019t have so much screen time but this is an emergency and a couple days won\u2019t kill her. It would be nice if the dad took her to the park or something but we all know he won\u2019t so this is the best I can come up with", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
