{"id": 33026, "submission_id": "18iiyp7", "title": "AITA for forcing a sale of my late husband and his girlfriend's home?", "selftext": "This has caused a lot of mixed reactions and I want unbiased opinion. Neither me nor my late husband and his girlfriend have any children.\n\nI(35f)  got separated from my husband(37m) over 10 years ago, unfortunately he has left me with a lot of debt to pay and in a position where I was nearly homeless. I have only stopped paying the debt off 2 years ago but there is still a lot of work to improve my credit history. Because of all the stress he caused me we never got divorced or formally separated. A matter of fact is we never spoke after I was kicked out from the flat so his girlfriend \"Anna\" can move in. I was planning to file for divorce once I have enough spare income, but some events took place before I was able to do so.\n\nNow to where I can be an asshole: 2 months ago my husband passed away in a freak accident. He left no will behind and has a house which is paid off with his girlfriend (he ended up having a big promotion at work). I have spoken to the lawyer and because we never divorced or filed for separation I am entitled to half of the house as his next to kin. \n\nLast week I have informed Anna through a letter that I want the house to be sold. She can either buy my half or I will have to force a sale, it is up to her. I do not want to live in the house, but the money from the sale could really help out to sort out the damage done by the loans I had to pay for the ex as well as a deposit for my own place so I don't have to live in absolute shitholes due to poor credit/not a very high paying job. It will also help me to work on my qualifications so I can get a better job and retirement.\n\nHowever Anna and my ex's family have called me a massive asshole, saying I have no right to the house (legally I do) and that I am being cruel and vindictive. I have reminded them that it is not my fault their son haven't divorced me or had a will and said I don't see how it is unfair as I had to pay for his debts while he lived a comfy life. \n\nSo Reddit am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I have seen this coming up as a question a few times and don't want to keep responding with the same comment. My ex has maxed out my credit cards and took loans in my name as well as cleared our savings account to fund his relationship with Anna and some of his gambling habits at the time. Due to being busy with work I haven't discovered the loans and cards being maxed out until it was too late and I had a few notices of non payment and him kicking me out and basically making it seem to everyone that I had the problem and he loaned me money which \"I\" paid him back by taking loans and cards as well as if \"I\" wanted him back so mad him \"gifts\". The total amount of debt is a bit over 50k which also resulted in me loosing my job while he got to keep his well paid job.\n\nRegarding the house - both Anna and my ex are on the deeds and had joint mortgage from what I was told, so legally she is entitled to the other half of the house", "created_utc": 1702588700, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18iiyp7/aita_for_forcing_a_sale_of_my_late_husband_and/", "score": 3533, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can't imagine getting to the point where I owned a home with somebody else without taking care of that first.\n\nOne thing I would suggest you consider - rather than forcing the sale, you could work something out with Anna to help her stay in the home. If she has half the equity in the house, she ought to be able to get a mortgage to buy you out even if her credit's not great.\n\nIf she can't get a mortgage, you could essentially consider financing the mortgage for her.

Force the sale - real estate is still at an all time high so it would 100% be worth forcing the sale and purchasing something for you.", "This.\n\nAnd pensions, Social Security death benefits... there is a lot you are entitled to... take FULL advantage.", "Because he died without a will it brings up interstacy laws in the uk (my dad died without a will too cause he was a drunk) everything to the value of 250k falls to a spouse, anything above that is split with a child/ children 50/50. Except chattel which the home in this case might be (its usually is a ppor) which is the spouses exclusively and not included in the estate math, this is all irrelevant as op doesn\u2019t have children and the home talked about isn\u2019t a ppor anyway, she\u2019s entitled to everything belonging to her husband including the half a house he owned, additionally any insurance or pension schemes they paid into goes to the spouse unless there is named beneficiaries listed. Op should have an estate lawyer go through everything. After all he\u2019s put her through she deserves to be repaid now.", "She is entitled  to his social security. She was married for more then ten years and was married to him at the time of his passing. If she cleared either one of these hurdles she would be entitled to it and she cleared both.", "She did say she inherited half the house(husband\u2019s half) , she could force a sale. I don\u2019t know if where you live things are different.", "Also don't tie to your life to a lying adulterous sack of a man. I never understand how anyone can watch a person treat their current partner so badly and then sign up for a round themself. But clearly happens all the time.", "Why should she. OP owes Anna nothing", "Karma it does work sometimes huh?", "It almost certainly would be put into trust as that is the usual practice in the U.K. (where it looks like OP is from). But she may still be the beneficiary under the trust if he\u2019s so disorganised he didn\u2019t get round to writing his Will/divorcing her\u2026", "Anna can't sell it without OP's consent.", "The courts will be in charge of sale and the girlfriend has to sell it at market value she can\u2019t cheap out because it will all go through the courts", "I think the house was bought by Anna and the ex, not by OP and ex so OP would not have had anything to do with it until after ex passed.", "OP never had anything to do with this house. It was bought my hubby and GF. When OP left the husband, they were living in a flat", "I won\u2019t spend a fortune on it but it will be cathartic to do it. In Australia contesting a will is quite successful in most cases.", "Maybe she meant joint on the deed?", "Yep, to me there are two things - OP got left with a huge amount of debt whilst husband ran free with a nice life, and I have no sympathy for a homewrecker.", "Absolutely. And who cares if Anna and the late husband's family thinks OP is an asshole? Let them think it, and take the money. They don't have to like it.\n\nNow, if they'd split amicably and the financial split had been fair AND THEN this situation had occurred, then OP would be an asshole for keeping half the house which she would be legally but not morally entitled to. But that's not what happened.", "She inherited  100% of the husband's estate. He only owned 50% of the house because the girlfriends name is on the deed. If the girlfriends name was not on the deed she would own 100% of it.\nEdit darn auto correct", "Me too!", "Sounds like ex was quite the liar -- who knows what story GF got fed to justify the cheating, or what she thought happened between the ex and OP. I'd put down money she thought that he had least gotten divorced at some point in the last ten years. Nasty shock for her about the house, I'm sure, but that isn't OP's problem.", "She is not his ex-wife.  They were still legally married.  Since they were still married, the wife (even though estranged) legally became his heir when he died. The girlfriend did not inherent anything from him, but since she was also on the deed (because the two of them bought the house together), she owns her half of the house. The wife inherited the other half.", "You jumped to a lot of conclusions based on some poor reading comprehension.", "I think some mortgages can have an insurance that pays off the rest of mortgage in case of death of one of the holders.(ie if OP's husband was the main earner then it would make sense).  \n\nTho Hubby doesn't seem that foreseeing because otherwise he would have left will or made sure that Anna got house entirely in case of his death.\n\nActually, you can be fired for debt problems.  \nhttps://www.opploans.com/oppu/credit-repair/you-can-get-fired-for-bad-credit/", "I work in finance.

That shit is wild. The higher your clearance the more random shit they watch you for. \n\nWhen I worked as a software architect for the DoD and had my clearance interviews - you wouldn't believe some of the questions they ask you or some of the things you can lose your clearance from.", "My company does the same.  You can also lose some licenses for certain unpaid debts.", "Well, as they are still legally married, OP gets half his estate", "And he's so responsible to add Anna to that title while not legally divorcing and maxing OPS cards?", "Ahh, my misunderstanding. I thought you previously owned it.", "I got divorced, quit claim deeded the house to my ex, and had a temporary layoff over a 3-month period. I also withdrew a substantial amount of my retirement savings.
