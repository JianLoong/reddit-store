He pays half the rent, so at least he does contribute, but that's about all he contributes. He doesn't save the remainder of his money. He blows it on pot and fastfood. Worst of all, he doesn't buy or contribute to groceries. And that's the problem. \n\nHe's always hungry due to his habitual drug use. And three days after I stock up on groceries, half of what I buy is gone. He'll get the craving for bread. Just bread, and eat 5 to 6 slices at a time, multiple times a day.

I work part time due to a few health issues and I can't afford to buy so much food only for him to eat it all. He immediately complained that he doesn't have the money for that, and I pointed out that he would do just fine if he learned to budget. He said that wouldn't work because he doesn't make enough (he makes more than my husband does) and that he would cut back on eating.\n\nI said no, that isn't an option. I told him I'd get a mini fridge for our bedroom and start locking all our food away where he can't get to it. He called me an asshole and locked himself in his room. He's been telling his friends that I'm trying to starve him, I'm classist and ableist since he has depression.
