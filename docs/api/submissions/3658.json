I'm mentally disabled due to life-long depression and health issues. I smoke weed every day for anxiety. \n\n*I sure as shit don't live with my friend from high school and eat a loaf of bread and half a dozen eggs a day.*\n\nIf he can't work then he needs to apply for disability. I suspect it's not depression, and even if it is, it is in no way your responsibility to house and feed him. You need to check the laws on eviction in your area/state/country, and then kick his ungrateful ass out as soon as possible!\n\nWhat about *your* mental health? What about your *physical* health when you literally can't afford to feed yourself because he eats all your food and then bitches to strangers about how mean you are?\n\nYou deserve better. He is using you, and it will *never* get better, only worse. Time to polish your spine and kick his keister!", "NTA", "Oh my god. \"I don't have money for food\"\n\nUm, that sounds like a you problem bro! NTA and definitely lock up your food from now on.", "Also kick him out please!", "If he has money for drugs, he has money for food.", "Before he moved in, my husband paid the rent and I paid the bills. It was his idea since he makes more than me. When the roommate moved in, roommate figured out that splitting the rent between the two of them left them paying about the same amount I did in bills, so they both agreed to do it that way.", "He didn't when he first moved in. Then he got that new job and, like I said, I hoped he would start saving. I'm not going to lie, we're the type who cares a bit too much and we end up getting walked all over. It's not something we plan on letting happen ever again.", "Sadly this isn't a meme. This is what we're going through.", "Would you let them eat more than their fair share? Because that's what's happening now.", "As I said before, I had no problem buying food for all of us until she started taking more than his share.", "So did you have a discussion about it before this blow-up? Or did you go 0-100 because you just filled with resentment instead of saying something?"]}
