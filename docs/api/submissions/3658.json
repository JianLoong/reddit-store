It was supposed to be temporary, a couple months at most until be found an apartment. Then he lost his job, took 4 months to find a new one and a year and a half later, he's still here. He pays half the rent, so at least he does contribute, but that's about all he contributes. He doesn't save the remainder of his money. He blows it on pot and fastfood. Worst of all, he doesn't buy or contribute to groceries. And that's the problem. \n\nHe's always hungry due to his habitual drug use. And three days after I stock up on groceries, half of what I buy is gone. He'll get the craving for bread. Just bread, and eat 5 to 6 slices at a time, multiple times a day. He cooks himself 4 to 6 eggs when it suits him, drinks half a gallon of milk when the munchies calls for cookies (which I also buy) and when I make dinner for my husband after a long 12 to 16 hour day of work, he always asks if he can have some and takes half before I get the chance to even get some for myself. \n\nWhen he first moved in, I didn't ask him to contribute to groceries because of his situation. But now I realize he was in that situation because of his own habits. Last night, after he finished off the last of the bread, I told him that he needed to start buying his own food. I work part time due to a few health issues and I can't afford to buy so much food only for him to eat it all. He immediately complained that he doesn't have the money for that, and I pointed out that he would do just fine if he learned to budget. He said that wouldn't work because he doesn't make enough (he makes more than my husband does) and that he would cut back on eating.\n\nI said no, that isn't an option. I told him I'd get a mini fridge for our bedroom and start locking all our food away where he can't get to it. He called me an asshole and locked himself in his room. He's been telling his friends that I'm trying to starve him, I'm classist and ableist since he has depression.
