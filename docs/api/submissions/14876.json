Could be why your request upset her so much if she\u2019s not ready to admit it to herself yet", "NTA tell her you don\u2019t want ANY alcohol at the shower", "NTA but your choices are limited. Have someone else throw the shower or have someone babysit her and drag her out if she goes overboard. As far as her saying you called her an alcoholic, a friend once told me, it doesn't matter what you call it, if a substance is causing issues, the person with the problem needs to do something", "NTA, and expect for her to not only bring alcohol, but to get drunk out of spite. I think you need to find someone else to throw you a smaller baby shower. I'm sorry.", "Nta but next time tell her that if she wasn't an alcoholic you wouldn't have to ask her not to show up drinking.", "NTA\nI think it is pretty normal to not drink at a baby shower, since the pregnant mom can't drink herself.", "NTA. Not every event has to be a \"drinking event.\" It sounds like your sister is an alcoholic, in which case I'm sorry, but you'll to have to draw some difficult boundaries out of love. It is very hard to make someone see their addiction before they're ready to change. I hope your baby shower goes well.", "NTA but would it be less stress to ask a parent or trusted relative to talk with sis? Just a thought", "NTA - Its a simple request", "It's a baby shower, why is there alcohol being served?", "NTA: OP, this is a simple request. If your sister cannot accept this or comply, she has a troubling, dependant relationship with alcohol. She apparently does not believe that her alcohol-related behavior negatively impacts others. She apparently hadn't experienced enough consequences.", "NTA. It's clear that you're concerned about your sister's behavior and want to ensure that she doesn't create any problems at your baby shower, which is perfectly reasonable. It's important to set expectations with your sister ahead of time and make it clear that you will not tolerate any over-drinking at the event. If she isn't able to abide by the rules, then you may need to enlist the help of some others to help keep her in check. But ultimately, the responsibility for getting her to behave is on her.", "NTA\n\nBut your sister DOES sound like an alcoholic if she gets wasted every-time she drinks. Drinking to get drunk is substance abuse (even if you don\u2019t do it often, you are abusing it in that circumstance but a party now and then isn\u2019t the same as doing it consistently and doesn\u2019t qualify you as an alcoholic solely on one night) but drinking moderately to socialize is very different. \n\nI\u2019d consider having someone else at least HELP throw the baby-shower to ensure she doesn\u2019t sneak alcohol in. And maybe consider a family intervention with a counselor (including pre-planned programs and resources to continue treatment after she hopefully consents during the intervention). I am probably projecting, I had an alcoholic father, and I don\u2019t want to assume your sister is one. But if you think she is, maybe just consider it. Interventions sound intense and scary, but it\u2019s really just ab open forum her family and friends to express how much they care about her and want her healthy. It can be a beautiful thing.", "[removed]", "NTA. Maybe instead of 'telling her' you just discuss it? Just say it makes you feel uncomfortable since you can't drink and leave out her drinking habit. \n\nAlso sitting the tone of the party earlier in the day may help. You do need your rest, don't you?", "NTA. But don't be surprised if she cancels it, or if she doesn't- that it's going to be a shitshow.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou have two options: \n\n* Accept the babyshower, and let your sister host. THen you don't get a vote.\n* Refuse the babyshower.", "Since you know that she sabotages all family events by drinking too much, the only way to save the baby shower is by having someone else throw it - a best friend, sister-in-law, mother-in-law or better yet have it at a restaurant on a weekday during lunchtime.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She clearly has a drinking problem. What possessed you to let her throw you a shower. If you can and it\u2019s long enough away and the invites aren\u2019t out, tell her you made a mistake and need to decline. Be honest that it\u2019s because of the drinking. But, you have told her you\u2019re uncomfortable, so now, if it\u2019s too far in to change your mind, you are stuck. Pick one close friend. Confess your fears about the drunk.
