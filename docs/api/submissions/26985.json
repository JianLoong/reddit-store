There are two ways you can do this. One - it isn\u2019t her being there only when he is there, so his defense that he wants to be around her more is invalid. When he isn\u2019t there, she should not be there.  That should be an easy compromise for him. Technically she does not live there and I would be tempted to tell her to leave when your brother is at work or gone. \n\nIf he can\u2019t agree to that, and he wants her to move in then I would propose that he live with her either somewhere else or, you move out and they can cover the rent together and talk to the landlord.\n\nI would also add that its pretty crap of him to show her your private texts.

You do not want a third roommate nor a permanent guest. If he insists on her staying, you can contact the landlord about your options.

It may have a clause that legally requires the same things you and your brother had discussed (no guests for more than X days at a time). You can inform the landlord to have gf evicted.\n2. It sounds like you paid a lot of fees up front. that's why brother pays 60% of the rent/utilities now. So if you left, you would be out some of those up front fees you already paid. I don't know how much that is, but it still might be worth it to you to look for another living situation if it's possible for you to get out of the lease (or leave once the initial lease is up).\n3. You can calculate what 2/3 of the rent/utilities is and tack on the 10% difference your brother has been paying (to make up for your up front payments) and tell brother that he is on the hook for that amount.

It sounds like you don\u2019t want another flatmate so you need to factor that into the conversation with your brother - once you know why she\u2019s there it would be good to have a group meeting together as she\u2019s really now a tenant too.", "You can actually have her trespassed from your property if she\u2019s not on the lease and won\u2019t leave.", "She lost wherever she was living so he moved her in and is ignoring you because he doesn't have a leg to stand on. Time to look for another place to live. NTA.", "INFO: when she is there without him why dont you tell her to go home?", "You have no leverage since he has another person to split rent with besides you. He's essentially taken over the apartment. You should start looking for a new place. It will always be their preferences first now. Make sure you get yourself off that lease when you leave and get her put on. If any utilities are in your name, have them transferred. You can get royally screwed by leaving things in your name. Next time you'll know to get things in writing, although that still wouldn't be enforceable.", "OP you have no leverage until you announce you you won't be renewing your part of the lease. You can tell your brother verbally or via text since you're on the introvert side. And start seriously looking for a new place!  \n\nNTA", "NTA. Look for a new place to live as soon as you are able. Your brother can figure out how he\u2019s going to accomodate his girlfriend at his own expense", "NTA. Unfortunately I think you\u2019ll just have to move. It isn\u2019t right or fair, but from what you\u2019ve said your brother is not going to see your side of this and is very selfish. Even though she\u2019s not on the lease, if she stays there enough and moves some things in, she could be considered a tenant with rights. I don\u2019t know how willing you are to blow up your relationship with your brother, so it\u2019s probably best to just talk to the landlord and  work out getting out of the lease.", "My brother had a similar situation with a roommate. Dude basically moved in his gf without telling anybody. From my what I remember she was a controlling B & crossed all sorts of boundaries & was trying to push put bro & the other roommate. She was always rude to me or other visitors as well. Only thing I really remember her doing was breaking one of my brother\u2019s ps5 controllers when he asked her not to drop it on the ground, so she proceeded to throw it across the room. I want to say something else broke during that incident but I don\u2019t remember what it was. I know I\u2019ve been told other incidents but it was a couple years ago & not my problem so my brain didn\u2019t retain that info, but I actually witnessed that one. So bro & roommate decided they would make her absolutely miserable when dude wasn\u2019t home (which would have been quite a bit since dude had a full time job & she didn\u2019t work). By the end, who ever was home would stand in dude\u2019s doorway and just tell her to leave repeatedly until she was so uncomfortable that she would go until dude got home. They would hide toilet paper, towels, remotes, or anything else that would inconvenience her. They would empty the kitchen of food whenever dude left the house, like down to the salt and pepper. They removed the shared tv & the gaming systems from the living room (I say shared but tv & 1 system belonged to roommate, the other system belonged to my brother, but until gf became a problem they were free for anyone\u2019s use) One time I went over during this time the place looked legitimately like a show apartment that no one lived in. Bro had the room next to theirs and literally rearranged his entire schedule so he could play video games, music, or tv all night at full blast. She legit had a meltdown & I want to say dude got into fistfights with both bro & roommate at least once each during this time, but she did eventually refuse to come back and made dude break his lease. I want to say this all lasted like 2 months, but could have been longer & I just wasn\u2019t aware until it was becoming obvious with the empty living room & kitchen.", "Walk about the house nakedand definitely 9nly pay 1/3 rent 3 people break it down for him", "NTA. What does your lease say about having people stay - some leases stipulate how long someone not on the lease can live there. \n\nTell your brother that she has to start paying. Also on your time off walk around in your underwear, play loud music and do what you would normally do anyway. How long is left on the lease, can you afford to live on your own - if you can tell him once the lease is up you will not be living with him anymore, tell him either he can stay in the current place and you will find something else - or he has to find something else.", "NTA Tel bro that you will take it to the landlord if you have to. Buy a mini fridge for your room and keep all your food locked away.", "NTA", ">Check the lease agreement with the landlord. It may have a clause that legally requires the same things you and your brother had discussed (no guests for more than X days at a time). You can inform the landlord to have gf evicted.\n\nIf the OP has this discussion with the landlord, the landlord won't evict the gf because he has no contract with her.  What the landlord will do is send a notice of lease violation to both the OP and the OP's brother because they are the ones responsible for adhering to the lease.  Usually the tenants have 3-5 days to cure a lease violation before the landlord starts eviction proceedings *against the tenants*.\n\nI do agree that this is the OP's only option if his brother refuses to kick out the gf but the OP needs to understand that everyone will be forced to move out if the gf doesn't leave.", "My guess is she has no home to go to.", "Are both their names on the lease?  If it's only OP he could be on the hook for whatever the brother doesn't pay.  I'd be cautious about only paying 1/3 if the brother's name isn't on the lease.", "Also check the lease rules with the landlord and see if she's allowed to live there and not be on the lease", "Talk to the landlord and explain the situation. Maybe they can move you somewhere else, or evict the girlfriend. In the meantime, make it extremely uncomfortable for her. Start screaming at random things, talk loudly to yourself, play really bad music loudly, etc. Interrupt her studies. Drive her out of the house.", "As a landlord, my lease would explicit not allow anyone not family to move in - I use a standard lease.\n\nSo, OP could have GF take over his part of the lease and move out, or he could talk to the GF, or he could talk to the landlord.\n\nAt the end of the day, it doesn't look like brother is giving up the GF, so make your decisions based on that. You aren't getting your alone time you originally agreed on, so you have to change your end goals.", "I was just thinking the same thing...she's lost her own place, for whatever reason, (since she apparently doesn't work I would bet non-payment of rent) so he moved her into your place.  I'd just leave, because he isn't going to make HER leave and obviously neither of then is going to pick up her share of the expenses.  Find a new place."]}
