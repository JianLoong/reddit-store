It's a little concerning that her boyfriend \"doesn't like\" her going out without him. Doesn't sound like their relationship is a very healthy one. But I think you're right to stop putting effort into the friendship.", "NTA. \n\nWhat exactly wouldn't her boyfriend like? Her having friends? That's a red flag, but she's so blinded she wouldn't see, anyway. \n\nYour boyfriend reacted good, though, he's supporting you and taking your side, as he should. \n\nI'm sorry your friend doesn't want to spend time with you anymore. You could eventually try asking her why, but i doubt she'd like that, or if she'd answer honestly.", "NTA at all, it\u2019s obvs hard to tell what their relationship is like\u2026 but it does sound like maybe she is in a toxic relationship especially if shes said her bf wouldn\u2019t like the idea of you 2 hanging out together without him AND the fact that she rushes home after an hour of hanging out. \n\nTry to speak to her about how you\u2019re feeling, there may be other reasons why she seems to not be able to put more effort into the friendship. It\u2019s a new year, and I hope in 2023 you are able to surround yourself with more friends who can appreciate you and put in effort to see you!", "Nta. Having to Rushing home , etc is controlling on her bfs part", "NTA - if you live in different countries and rarely get to see each other, she should make an effort to spend some time with you without her partner. If she chooses not to, it\u2019s time to move on and stop making the effort.", "NTA. She can go out with you without her boyfriend. Her boyfriend sounds really controlling. She has to be able to speak up for herself. If she can\u2019t do that, it is ok to scale back from your friendship. Someday, she may not have the boyfriend and she will be sad she prioritized his demands over your friendship.", "NTA , and I would have done the same thing", "NTA: She should try to spend some time alone with you if you barely see each other. It's time to move on and quit making the effort if she decides not to.\u00a0You are no longer required to play along if she can't find time to spend a couple hours with you just as friends. Friendships shouldn't always be dependent on the relationships of one individual. Your partner is an AH as well for being so unkind and selfish to you.", "NAH - you\u2019re definitely not an AH - it sounds like she is involved with a very controlling guy - that doesn\u2019t make her an AH either, but you should probably try to keep an eye on her for her safety - her BF is probably abusive in other ways", "NAH/NTA. You\u2019re not the asshole for wanting to have one on one time with your bestie - my best friend and I have girls nights once or twice a month even though she\u2019s engaged. But some women, once entering relationships, center their whole social worlds around their partners and hate doing stuff without them. It\u2019s shitty and it shouldn\u2019t be that way, but it is like that for some women and she\u2019s not an asshole for not feeling comfortable going out without her boyfriend (especially if he\u2019s at all controlling and she\u2019s afraid of him).", "NTA.\n\nIf she can\u2018t make time to spend a few hours only with your as friends, you aren\u2019t obligated to play along anymore. Friendships shouldn\u2018t always be tied to one person\u2018s relationship.\n\nAnd your boyfriend is an AH for being so selfish and inconsiderate towards you as well.", "ESH - you shouldn\u2019t cut someone off for just one shitty thing especially if they are a life long friend. It also makes me think something is happening with her current partner, toxic and abusive partners often isolate their significant others from their family and friends as a form of control. \n\nMy advice would be to maybe miss out on seeing them this year but really let them know you miss hanging out just the two of you and dont lose touch.", "Nta BUT\n\nI know a lot of people that are uncapable of activity without the partner. You can't judge them for a behaviour different to yours.", "ESH - Your friend should be willing to spend an evening without her boyfriend.\n\nLikewise, it seems an extreme measure to cut all contact with a childhood friend because of this. \n\nIs there a middle ground you could reach with you friend?", "I\u2019m kinda torn.. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for being upset, but to no longer hang out in person altogether is a bit much for someone you claim has been your best friend since childhood.. so, YTA, but just barely.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is not a time to abandon what has always been a good friendship - see if you can get her to open up and make sure she knows that you have a safe place for her if she ever needs it.", "ESH.\n\nYou are both a little immature. The friend for the extreme codependency that is their relationship with the boyfriend. You for trying to force your friend into compliance by rescinding time together until they do what you want.

Did you ask them about their own feelings?", "NTA her bf sounds controlling, she always chooses what the activities or plans are probably due to her bf suggestions.  If the outings are not as much fun anymore then there is no longer a need to do double dates.", "NTA but you might want to pay close attention... she says \"he wouldn't like it\".... sounds controlling.  She might not be in a great situation with him. I know Reddit likes to jump to conclusions, but...  well. You know your friend.

They're together everyday :/", "More context for my question\n\n1. Is the best friend the only person living in a different country in this scenario? If so, then during the two times you guys see each other, is she the one coming back to your country? Are those also only the times that she gets to see her boyfriend?\n2. If it's the best friend and her boyfriend who both live abroad, then do they both travel to your country to see you? Does he have friends/anyone else in your country that he can hang out with while your best friend would hang out one-on-one with you?\n3. Or are you the only one living in a different country? And you are you going to visit both your best friend and your boyfriend?\n4. Or is your boyfriend also making a trip twice a year with you?\n5. Or do you guys take turns to visit each other?\n\nThe situation changes in every scenario.

English is not my first language.", ">How do you understand it, since you're not sure?\n\nOriginally, I was under the impression that it's the best friend who is traveling back to her home country and I wasn't sure if she and her bf live in the same country. If that were the case, then it would be sus if OP's bf was calling the best friend in AH.\n\nBut based on new context provided by OP, my original impression was incorrect. Given that it is OP and her bf who travel to the other country, I now think OP's bf's opinion makes sense.\n\nBut also, jfyi\n\n>Yes, i've read that part multiple times before i commented to you.\n\nI'm not the person you replied to :) I just randomly jumped into the convo. Sorry about that.", "Neither is mine, no worries. ^^", "NTA I had a boyfriend like that. Controlling.

There\u2019s an issue if he gets upset with her hanging with others without him or she\u2019s cuts things short to get home to him early. Also you live in another country so this is not someone she sees on a regular. You should let her know this upsets you and you would like one on one time with her without your partners around. Maybe voice your concerns if she says she feels bad leaving him behind or he gets upset.", "NTA But I\u2019m curious if your friend constantly checks her phone and messages during your girl\u2019s nights. As other commenters have said, her rushing home bodes poorly for her position in her relationship.", "Her decision to spend time alone with you shouldn\u2019t affect your decision to do a double date if you also enjoy that. In the long run, you\u2019ll have to recognize that your relationship is changing and this is how it\u2019s going to be if the friend has an SO. It\u2019s up to you to determine if you want to adjust to this change in the friendship parameters. \nNAH", "NTA, but I think your friend isn't purposefully being an AH either. \n\nPlease do speak to her about her partner because that's very controlling (and is what I expected would be the problem because it happens a lot). He seems controlling, and this is a form of abuse. Not allowing to go out on her own. If she were, I expect he would accuse her of cheating and being out to see men, even accusing of cheating with your partner. It is 100% unhealthy to expect your partner to not go out without you. She needs help seeing that she's not being treated right. Because for most of us it takes a long time to realize what's happening to us. Take it from those with experience. If she left after an hour of hanging out without him, that rings alarm bells in my head. Because that just tells me she was scared. and if she was scared, she expected something scary. So I doubt it has stopped at controlling behaviour. \n\nThis sort of behaviour from someone - not going out alone without the partner - is a pretty telling sign.", "That\u2019s not healthy behavior. Not saying they should be \u201cjudged\u201d but it\u2019s not just \u201cdifferent behavior\u201d. Codependency isn\u2019t a good thing.", "Oh no worries! I was at the store at the time and didn't even look at the nicknames. xd didn't occur to me someone else might have replied to me tbh ^^ \n\nThanks for explaining either way!"]}
