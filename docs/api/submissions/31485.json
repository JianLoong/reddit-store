Turned out fine, and everyone was happy with our decision, but imagine going against the traditions when over 500 people are involved. And I wouldn't even consider having meat at a wedding a real \"tradition\". A wedding like a Turkish wedding is much more than \"two people love each other and want to stay together forever\". It's a social event, and OP is right when she writes, \"the wedding is for them, not for us\". People could argue that it is totally different to a western wedding where everything is about the couple, but in my opinion, OP's statement is more honest and definitely closer to the truth. Otherwise, people wouldn't complain that much about a vegetarian, sober, or Halloween themed wedding. Also, the fact that the groom's family pays for the wedding in OP's culture also proves that she and her fianc\u00e9 have little say about if they want their traditions at their wedding or not.  \n\nI put \"western\" in \"\" because there isn't just one western tradition, and there isn't really a point where you can draw a line.", "It is not the couple who reads out the gifts. It's either a close relative or a hired person. There are around 500 to 1000 people present at such event, so I guess sneaking out at the moment when everyone else is standing in a line to hand over the envelopes should have been possible (and it is being done as far as I know). What the aunt and her cousins did wasn't a \"faux pas\". A faux pas means that you accidentally did something that is socially unacceptable. OP stated that the aunt and cousins gave 50bucks and less (at least the aunt was expected to pay at least around 1000$. That's what she got for her wedding, and that's what's expected to come from a close family member). Giving that amount was meant to be a slap in the face for the couple, and it was meant to be read out loud. Again: If you can't pay the amount everyone expected for whatever reason, there is always a way around the public announcement. It's not always meant to save the face for the gift-giver, but it is mostly meant to protect the couple from humiliation. \n\nThe aunt didn't humiliate herself. She humiliated the couple and made sure everyone knew that she disliked them.", "Can't agree more. There are reasons for traditions like these, and aunt and her family also profited from them. It was meant to be a cultural \"f you\" and that's the real issue. My post was meant to remind people that there are millions of different wedding traditions and that \"the couple is meant to pay for their wedding on their own\" isn't always the case. Financial support plays a huge role in a lot of weddings, which is totally fine for me (and also plays a big role in my family tradition, even though not as big as in some cultures)", "I have read some of OP's comments. Apparently, it was her aunt's family gifting around 15$ (I wrote this so often that I really hope I don't mess the numbers up). Her aunt is nowhere poor (and according to my friend, there would be a way around that just to save her face). So, even I as a person  not coming from a culture with such traditions knows that her \"gift\" wasn't a real gift but meant as an insult for the couple. Nope, wouldn't want that either.", "Probably.  But I don't know if AITA posts are a thing in those subs and we can't stop people from posting here just because their culture is different (would be a big no-go). But I also think that  OP would most likely a better judgement there.", "You mean the way OP's aunt treated OP's sister? There are many ways to insult a person, and OP's aunt chose a way everyone at the wedding understood was meant to be humiliating.

Cash is normal.

You gift envelopes with money and all the envelopes would be opened and the amount announced. How much you give shows how close you are to the newlyweds. Giving only a small amount  when you could afford more would be considered very rude. It would say you don\u2019t love this person.  I always asked Turkish colleagues about the right amount to give. I guess you\u2019re from a similar culture?\nIt\u2019s not my culture but I recognize that Turkish weddings tend to be really large and the money would help if you weren\u2019t rich to pay for all the guests. Not inviting everyone you know wouldn\u2019t be an option either. People from cultures that have a background of generations of living well may not understand.", "Honestly, you\u2019ve got a 50/50 shot when you come on here as to if you\u2019ll actually get reasonable responses based on your culture and it\u2019s not looking like it\u2019s going in your favor. Your cousins broke the cultural contract at your sister\u2019s wedding why on earth should you invite them to yours? \n\nIt would be like if a woman in the west wore a white dress to your sister\u2019s wedding and said they did it because that was their best color, get over it. If that was the case then you\u2019d have people saying she showed you what she thought of your family, why risk it?\n\nMy understanding is that this is a way of showing good will to the couple and helping them start out their life together. It would be one thing if they couldn\u2019t fulfill traditional gift expectations, but especially with them just saying they didn\u2019t want to? It\u2019s a slap in the face. If they don\u2019t consider you close enough then why should they be close enough to get an invite?", "While in America this would be appalling, I actually understand from some coworkers/friends cultures that it\u2019s kind of a reasonable thing to be frustrated with.\n\nI wonder though if it\u2019s more of a lack of money than family being cheap?", "Seems fair enough to me. If they have the money to give, but want to culturally embarrass the shit out of you I understand that you don't want them there.", "Out of curiosity OP do you know why they don\u2019t want to? Has there been something that your immediate family did or a race thing etc?", "In that case, the hypocrisy annoys me and I understand your frustration and stance on this.

Shame on all of you. YTA", "Something being cultural doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have a choice. OP, moreover, refuses to say what this magical country, in which everybody demands up to 5000 dollars from aunts and uncles and announces the amount publicly, is.

Nothing wrong with that it just seems like a crazy amount, not that I'm doubting you. \n\nBut I'm not talking about what ops family did. But if op doesn't invite all of their family isn't that going to be a pretty big deal in this wedding? That seems like the kind of thing everyone will remember. Not doing that whole line for handing over the money and making it all anonymous would seem to be the smaller deal wouldn't it? I understand you can't easily change things like that and it'll be an issue. But I would imagine not inviting all your family would be the bigger deal. \n\nThough I would disagree to some degree on the last paragraph. Yes it's a big public insult to the couple who will be humiliated.

Depending on the wedding, it can be a close relative, or you hire someone to do it. There is a long queue, and everyone hands the envelope to that person who publicly announces the amount (no other gifts, just money. Sometimes gold or jewellery, but it depends). The reason why it is done varies, but mostly, it makes sure that the couple gets enough for their future life (because nobody wants to be greedy). Again, it's not the couple that initiates all of this. Also, remember that her aunt profited from their traditions. \n\nWhat she and they cousins did was meant as a huge \"f you\"", "Yeah she literally said it's cultural and would be an embarrassment to her in front of her new husband's family, plus would likely cause some contention between the in-laws.

Not every country has the same traditions and for you to call those traditions tacky is incredibly rude.", "Changed for the whole country?", "If we are not as wealthy no one is gonna be upset that we give less money. My own parents couldn't afford to give much money to my sister and it was no problem. It's only a problem when someone can afford it but won't give it", "I have read a few of OP's comments. First off: There are several cultures with a similar tradition, but I even send it to a friend coming from a family with such traditions, and she was shocked. Not from OP, but from the aunt and her family:\nAs far as I understood, her aunt's family gifted around 15$. Not sure if OP exaggerated the situation, but depending on the social status, a family member that close is expected to pay around 1.500$. If you are well-off, it could be even more. My friend explained that everyone is getting that, so when aunt married (or her children), they would have gotten the same from OP's family. There are different reasons why you pay so much, but one reason is that for most cultures with traditions like these, a wedding with 500 guests is considered small. \nAlso, OP wrote that her aunt's family isn't poor at all and doesn't have a problem with paying much more for different weddings. So, they made the \"gift\" by choice (oh, my friend also told me that most families have a way around if someone can't afford the gift. Mostly to keep their face and the couple's. But that's her culture and family, I don't know if there is something similar for others). \nGifting 15$ (again: If OP wasn't exaggerating) is like a huge \"f you!\" to the couple. I can promise you that everyone felt silent after that. It's like \"objecting during the vows (you can see it as a disapproval of the couple), smashing the gift table and making a speech about how much you hate your family at once\". Nope, wouldn't want that for my wedding either.", "Wow, that is a dick move. Culturally it's very different to our time used to the idea of snubbing somebody like that at a wedding seems beyond rude.

Everyone knows what giving 50bucks and less means if you probably got 1000$ for your own wedding (and yes: you are meant to repay the favour to the next family member who marries). It is a bit hard to explain (especially when English isn't your first language) but it's a bit like if you publicly announced that you stole the money you were supposed to save for the next wedding from your family. Normally, one person keeps tracks of who gifted what so that you can return the favour. Imagine one of OP's cousins (one of them who also gifted 50bucks and less. And no, we are not talking about little kids who can't afford a thing) marries next: OP's sister either has to gift the amount usually expected or has to return the favour of 50bucks. Yes, it is less of a gift and more of an investment.\nI stated in another comment that a family feud probably is unpreventable (family no matter the culture have falling outs over smaller issues than money and more or less telling your family members at a wedding that you hate them). So, OP can either keep the (false) peace for another wedding, get herself humiliated (if her aunt decide to do the same stunt again. But if she suddenly decides to give the money everyone expected she also would need to explain why she didn't do it for her first niece) and someone after her will cause the final outburst.

There is a reason why the grooms family pays for most of the wedding, and the couple gets huge monetary gifts (no, if you are invited to an event like this you are usually not expected to gift the same amount).", "understandable but still rediculous. if you throw a party/ social gathering for any other reason it would make you entitled to expect guests to give such large gifts. slap a ring on it and a bit of paper and theres suddenly an expectation to pay over the odds to attend.", "I don't see why someone should be welcomed equally when they've taken a $1k gift and given a $15 one in return with no difference in income.", "I think you\u2019re missing the cultural aspect here.

One example is birthdays you generally get $101 from close family. It\u2019s a value of good luck. There\u2019s many things like that. Another is for new year we always get $2 bills. Like the actual 2 dollar bill not two singles.\n\nFor OP, it sounds like a $25 gift would be as insulting as wearing white to an American wedding.", "It\u2019s customary in Japan, Korea and Italy to publicly announce gift amounts?

It is a huuuuge event with a ridiculous amount of guests (we are talking about 500 to 1000 guests in average) and not  all of them are directly connected to the couple. Not getting an invite can be a huge insult (doing what her aunt and cousins did at her sister's wedding probably justified it) and cause family drama for generations. Do you know the original story of \"sleeping beauty\"? There is a reason why a fairy lost her sh*t for not getting invited because of a missing golden plate. Many people today don't understand it, but I can only guess that people back then cringed about the fauxpax committed by the King and Queen. And not inviting your father's business partners (and for them: Not going when they haven't an excellent reason not to go) even though you have never met them in your whole life can be as much as an insult as not inviting Maleficent to the christianing of little Aurora. \nThe couple has little to no say in who to not invite, but having your aunt's family causing a scene one time probably justifies the couple to cut her out, even though her parents want to keep the peace. That's one reason why they get soo much money for their wedding. Firstly, most people can't afford such an event when they are in their mid-twentieth. That's why OP is writing she isn't doing it for herself, but for the family (she marries the guy because she wants to marry him, but the whole event is more for the family than the couple). Secondly, they are expected to pay everyone back when they are marrying. That's one reason why the thing the aunt and the cousins did is such an insult: If they are married (and the aunt most likely is, I can't speak for the cousins) they already got the expected money (which is depending on your position, age and how close you are to the couple around 1000$. It can be significantly less, but OP somewhere stated that that was the amount that everyone expected), and now, they are \"repaying the favour\" with 50 bucks and less. It's like publicly announcing that you are stealing the money you own your family. Again: At a \"normal\" wedding, nobody expects you to repay a gift years later. But in OP's culture, that's an unwritten rule everyone needs to follow. As far as I know, while reading out loud how much everyone gave the the amount is also documented so that you know what to give when your cousin marries next time. You can probably see now where this is going.... \n\nThis is probably going to end in a family feud anyway. But it is now on OP if she wants to keep a (false) peace for a little bit longer just so it isn't her who initiated it (even though she didn't cause it) or if she says \"screw you, I don't want to get humiliated at my own wedding\".  Needless to say, the situation is bad.", "Only $25 from her family would be equal to them announcing that they think OP is worthless and unworthy of respct.
