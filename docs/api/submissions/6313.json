I run a business and part of the service I offer uses a drone.  The drone I use is on the more expensive side since it has swappable sensor mounts so I can use thermal imaging or multi spectral sensors in addition to a regular camera.  In the past I\u2019ve used it to take family photos for Christmas cards etc.  \n\nSo this year I was taking photos and my wife\u2019s 6 year old cousin asked if he could fly the drone when we were done.  I said no since there were a lot of trees where we were taking the pictures and didn\u2019t want to risk him running it into a tree. His dad said he would be careful and I should let him.  I stood my ground and said there was no way I was letting a 6 year old fly a $5000 drone.  \n\nThe kid was mad and screamed for a while but I figured whatever it\u2019s a parenting moment.  So I went back to taking pictures.  A few minutes later I here the kid\u2019s orbeez gun shooting, then my drone making awful noises and then catching a tree branch and crashing.  It took me a second to realize this kid had just gone to the car and grabbed his orbeez gun and shot the drone down.  The camera was snapped off at the gimbal, all of the props were broken and one of the arms had broken.  \n\nI just packed everything up, told my wife\u2019s uncle he would be covering the repair bill for that, and then left with my wife.  The repairs cost $1300 and when I sent the statement to my wife\u2019s uncle he said that accidents happen.  I explained how what his son did was not an accident and he needed to make it right or I would be filing a claim in small claims court.\n\nHe unhappily sent me the money to cover the cost,  my wife is hearing from other people in her family that I should have tried to work things out a different way and I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to treat family that way and I should have not made anyone else pay for it.  I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong and that my wife\u2019s uncle should have handled his kid better", "created_utc": 1672684287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101jrv5/aita_for_making_my_wifes_uncle_pay_to_repair_a/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And tried to deny any responsibility \"accidents happen\". Well, sure they do but that wasn't an accident. That was his son intentionally damaging something because he was pouting and didn't get what he wanted.", "NTA-obviously. His kid intentionally shot it down because you didn\u2019t let him fly it. It wasn\u2019t an accident. And even if it was an accident, if a child breaks something, it\u2019s the parents responsibility to make things right. And you could have made him pay $5,000 to get a new one, so you were more than reasonable.", "NTA the kid broke it so his dad needs to pay for it. \u201cFamily \u201c does not mean you have to pay for other people\u2019s expenses.", "NTA, obviously. That's not an accident, that's the kid purposefully breaking your shit because you wouldn't let him play with it.", "The only acceptable alternative I would accept is if I could shoot the kid with a full paintball gun. \n\nNTA. Parent your goddamn kid or pay for its fuck ups.", "A 6-year-old leaves his father's sight walks to the car, opens the door and comes walking back with an orbeez gun in his hand...he knew exactly what the kid was doing!

You said no and the kid intentionally shot it down. He\u2019s lucky you only charged him $1300!", "NTA, you were generous not to demand a full replacement drone.

Parents are responsible for the actions of their children.", "NTA\n\nHis kid intentionally damaged the drone! He was trying to pass it off as an accident in the hope you'd leave it & not go after him for the cost of repairs!\n\nThe rest of the fam sound like AH's for saying you should have sorted it another way! Just because you're fAmIlY doesn't give them the green light to intentionally damage other people's property.", "NTA. The uncle and his kid were both out of line. You\u2019re in the right.", "Absolutely NTA. The child used a weapon to damage your property. You break it, you buy it.", "NTA.   The child maliciously damaged your drone.   He and his Dad should be glad you didn't call the police and have him charged.", "NTA. Are you planning on taking any more photos for this group? I'd recommend getting a deposit if they request you to in the future.", "Nta", "NTA the kid got mad and destroyed you drone. They are responsible for his actions.", "NTA! They should be happy that you didn't take them to court.   \nThem going and whining to the family when they were extremely clearly in the wrong just shows how pitiful they are.", "NTA.\nAs a general rule, parents do have to pay for anything their kids break. While it is possible to be generously merciful, it is not something to be entitled about.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that the kid stole the drone - use it without agreement- is aggravating the case. So you are totally in your right.\n\nThat's said, it's too bad that the \"teaching moment\" didn't happen for anyone. The uncle is really in fault her for pushing you to share your drone with his kid and so diminishing your refusal in the kids'eye (pretty sure that if the father agreed that it wasn't for a kid to play, the kid would have respected the first \"no\"). But he didn't learn anything as he is complaining to family.\nAnd so as he is complaining rather that owning his failure to parent right, I guess the kid didn't suffer any consequences for his action.", "NTA.\n\nNope, you were right. After your refusal this kid went and nearly destroyed a valuable piece of equipment. Uncle needs to explain to kid No means really No and it's right he had to pay for the damages.", "NTA. It sounds like a different story has been circulated through the family since no one in their right mind would think a father who allows his six year old to shoot down a drone belonging to someone else shouldn\u2019t be responsible for the repair bill. \n\nDon\u2019t worry. When that child hits his teen years it will be startling obvious to everyone that he was not raised properly.", "NTA he's responsible for his child's actions. If he didn't want to pay for the damage, he shouldn't have allowed his child to cause that damage. Don't budge on this.", "Did you get the kid\u2019s actions on film? If so, post them to show the asshole family members.", "NTA.  The drone isn't a toy.  And any \"toy\" that can shoot down a drone isn't really a toy, and definitely shouldn't be used unsupervised.  \n\nI'm glad that OP was reimbursed for the repairs.  I think that the 6-year old kid has anger management issues and if his response to being told \"no\" is to shoot  and destroy things, the only other different way of working things out would be for the parents to spend the $1300 on family counseling.", "NTA\n\n\nTechnically (by technically I mean it did happen, but there's no chance in hell he would be persecuted) that 6 year old just downed an aircraft in violation of Title 18 US Code 32 of the 1984 Aircraft Sabotage Act.\n\nShit carries a hefty prison sentence, uncle is glad he ain't getting a visit from CPS for encouraging the shootdown of aircrafts by his son.", "Nta. His son didn\u2019t even do it on accident, he shot the drone down on purpose. I\u2019m glad you stood your ground and made the Dad pay for repairs. There\u2019s a parenting lesson there for sure haha", "But a soiled child in the family is entitled to demand use of expensive equipment belonging to s member of the family????    \n\nAsk the family members exactly how that could be worked out some other way than the dad paying for his son\u2019s malicious act?\n\nAsk family members how they would react if the same child through a rock through their big screen tv; demanded to drive their car and when told no, flattened the tires or poured sugar in the tank.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He\u2019s 6 now but it\u2019s safe to call him a menace and AH bc no one is going to set him straight. Kid is a future AH and his dad is a present AH", "NTA,  uncle is probably whining about having to pay. He should focus on teaching his kid not to be a vandal.", "NTA. Dude is a crap parent, first for trying to wheedle you into letting his six year old play with your (NOT a toy) drone, second for allowing the little brat to shoot it down, third for trying to squirm out of taking responsibility for his bad parenting and his son's bratty behavior. \n\nGlad you made him pay. He was probably raised like he's raising his son... spoiled, entitled, nothing is ever his fault.", "NTA he is doing his child a great disservice by allowing him to act this way.", "NTA I would not have let my 6 year old even ask to use someone else\u2019s expensive equipment, let alone let him make it out my line of sight with a weapon to shoot it down\u2026. Also why does a six year old have a weapon that can damage anything like that? Are nerf guns not good enough anymore?", "NTA. His kid INTENTIONALLY broke your drone out of SPITE. He is responsible for his sons actions, and (I assume) his bad parenting and the lack of consequences he enforces are the reason the son acted out that way in the first place. Not to mention, this is an expensive drone you use for work and not some sort of cheap toy that\u2019s easily replaced. You explained that to them before the incident so it\u2019s not on you that they did not take you seriously and he wasn\u2019t watching his son. Also, I\u2019m not sure what else you could have tried first. The drone needed repaired. That was the cost. Why should you put yourself out of pocket and sit around waiting for them to slowly pay it off? If anything that would have probably just dragged out the drama of it or you wouldn\u2019t have ended up getting paid in full. I think you made the right call. You would only be a minor AH if they were somehow in a dire financial situation where paying you everything upfront would have meant they can\u2019t eat or pay their rent/mortgage for the month\u2026in that scenario I could maybe see because they are FaMiLy that you give a little leeway. Even then though you wouldn\u2019t be *obligated* to do that. \n\nPlay stupid games you win stupid prizes. Next time around I\u2019m willing to bet he will make sure his son doesn\u2019t play such stupid games.", "Nta- if the kid shot your drone, he\u2019s to blame. The uncle sounds like a total ahole for giving his kid a gun that he isn\u2019t mature enough to use without damaging property. In the United States, property is basically more important than people- our country punishes people who destroy or Rob property in extreme ways. If he did that to a stranger, your uncle and his brat would be dealing with the police", "NTA. Why does family always think they get a pass for shitty behavior? His kid was angry he didn't get to play with something and acted like a child (which he is) and he broke your drone. Like you said, it was a parenting moment and the uncle failed to parent and this is the result. If the uncle refuses to parent, then he forced your hand.", "Nta. I would have been so embarrassed if my kid has behaved that way and paid immediately. I don\u2019t understand what the relatives are thinking here.", "NTA", "NTA. That kid is going to cost the parents a lot more money down the road.", "NTA- this isnt a toy drone for $300 from the store. Its a very professional one you use for your business", "NTA. The \"ffaaaammmiiillllyyy\" argument doesn't hold water, especially when it comes to hurting your livelihood.", "NTA. Whatever happened to the concept of \"parents are responsible for the actions and conduct of their children?\" Heck, most of the parents I grew up around (including mine) would have taken the Orbeez gun and turned it into more fragments than the drone ended up in assuming the kid wasn't shown the corner to stand in as soon as the tantrum started.", "This is such blatant updoot bait i'm surprised it hasn't been reported and taken down yet.", "Also extremely concerning that the child heard the word \"no\" and decided to resort to using a weapon. That's some serious criminal behaviour in the making right there.", "That stood out to me, too\u2014in what \u201cdifferent way\u201d should this have been handled? It\u2019s a simple \u201cyou broke it, you bought it\u201d situation.\n\nAre these other nosy Parker\u2019s offering actual alternatives? I\u2019m guessing not, nor are they offering to make it right.", "After this event no.  I\u2019ve been flying different drones for my business for 6 years and this was the first time I have had a drone \u201ccrash\u201d and need to be sent in for repairs that weren\u2019t from wear and tear."]}
