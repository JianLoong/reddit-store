No. No more.  This is how you end up with the \"Uncle that pinches\" and they just herd the kids away, but you don't get a reason.

You've now likely embarrassed your sister alot. Thrown away a friendship with very minimal effort to resolve it. That was a super weird thing for him to say.

That\u2019s her choice which she has the right to do but, people will notice, and they will see the outline of her nipples. It doesn\u2019t make them a creep. It\u2019s just a fact. You can\u2019t get that butt hurt because he happened to be one of the people who noticed. \n\nHe was probably laughing because of how awkward it was BECAUSE he\u2019s known her since she was kid. Unless he\u2019s said inappropriate things towards her before, that was a MAJOR over reaction to an observation.  \n\nAnother thing, there was ZERO reason to bring it up in a public and embarrass your sister like that. You pointed out that someone noticed her breasts in front of everyone. How was any less embarrassing for her? Unless this is normal behavior for him towards her, you really need to regulate your emotions better, cause this was an unhinged reaction otherwise.", "YTA bc u failed to address it with him directly and instead chose to block him, then made assumptions that someone would not come to something they were invited to, then chose to assassinate his reputation. all cause you didn\u2019t want to communicate.\n\nyea the comment was off, but u could have just been like \u201cmate it\u2019s 2023 not 1923, have a look around, that\u2019s normal and you\u2019re being creepy. I need some space, plz don\u2019t come to the bbq tomorrow\u201d", "Honestly when things like this happen it's really awkward and it catches you by surprise.  I had dorm mates wear short shorts and no underwear and she just came in my dorm room and hopped on my bed and it's like, wooa am I supposed to pick up on this.... is this a total accident, like you don't want to embarrass them but you also aren't sure if this was a obvious invitation (in the case I'm referring to it was a total accident she had just showered).\n\nIt's honestly hard to know what to do other than to try and not to stare.  I only eventually told her a few weeks later because some other guy on the floor had told her and she insisted it wasn't possible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's probably not the first time it's happened. It's probably just the first time that anyone's noticed it happening, or had the courage to say anything.\n\nThe reason I'm guessing that, is because he had the balls to actually tell Op That that's what they were doing. First time offenders tend to be embarrassed or won't draw attention to their behavior.\n\nAnd it's not non-invasive interaction. It's not not a big deal. Normal people with a rational mind don't stare at somebody's chest and giggle like a child, and then message their sibling stating that they weren't wearing a bra, normal mature rational people ignore when someone's not wearing a bra.\n\nHe was acting like a creep, you've got rightfully called out on it.

And I feel bad for any women, or anyone in general in your life.", "im not makin excuses for creepy behavior, im saying we're all human and the way u learn from doing something wrong is being corrected on it. if no one ever corrects u then u end up being uncalibrated in social situations and actin like this. on the flip side, if u see something and u dont correct it and then let it escalate to public humiliation as your only attempt of dealin with it, then UTA. shoulda acted earlier instead of assuming ur buddy could read ur mind.\n\ni believe broad application of my way makes the world a better place than broad application of ur way\n\nalso judgin by OP's grammar, they dont appear to be in North America, so u may be applying the lense of ur culture to a place where it isn't relevant or in focus. for example do us civilized folk think only savages require women to wear head scarves? well, yes. but within that culture it is acceptable to intimidate / harass women that dont have head scarves.\n\nbtw im not sayin starin man aint an A, i dont care im answering the question is OPTA."]}
