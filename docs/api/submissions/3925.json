So i apologise for all mistakes in advance. \n\nMy MIL who is usually very sweet and nice asked me to try on her wedding dress as she wanted to gift it to me for the wedding. I did not want to hurt her and so I tried on the dress (even though I knew that I wanted to buy my own dress). I fittet quite well and looked pretty but not what I was looking for at all. \nSo I thanked MIL for the opportunity and the gesture but that it was not what I envisioned myself wearing on my wedding day. But that she was welcome to join me and my mom the next day when we were looking for wedding dresses. \n\nShe joined us and I thought everything was fine. But during the shopping she tried to make me try on dresses similar to her weddingdress, but more my style. I tried two of her picks but stated that it was still not what I was looking for, even though I liked it a little better on me then her dress. And I thanked her for helping me. \n\nShe got quiet and only shrugged her shoulders over the other dresses I tried on. \nI finally found my dream dress, bought it (I am paying about 2000\u20ac and my parents payed about 300\u20ac for shoes and a veil. My In-laws don\u2019t pay anything towards the dress or the wedding) and then we went to eat lunch together. \n\nMIL was still unusually quite so i asked what was wrong and if I could help her. She shrugged her shoulders and said \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d and I thought she needed a little time for her. So I started a conversation with my mom and started eating after we all got our food. We did not exclude her and tried to make her a part of our conversation. But she just shrugged and moped. \n\nA few minutes into lunch she said \u201cYou are a ungrateful spoiled brat.\u201d And I was utterly confused and asked why. That\u2019s what she said:\n\n\u201cI would have gifted you my dress but it wasn\u2019t good enough for little miss-I-want-a-new-dress. That\u2019s ungrateful. And i tried to find a compromise with a dress that matched our both tastes in a dress and you still denied all that. Your so ungrateful and impolite. Not even able to make a compromise.\u201d\n\nThen she stood up, paid for her meal and left without me being able to say anything. \n\nI asked my fianc\u00e9 later that day about it and he told me to not very as I did nothing wrong. But SIL texted me that I was an ungrateful asshole for hurting her mother this much and not compromising on anything. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670158163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc92p8/aita_for_not_wearing_my_mils_wedding_dress_and/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, there are plenty of things that you could compromise with to make family happy, such as the guest list to include some of their friends, the menu to make sure key people have food they like, and certain traditions/ceremony components.

Honestly even the groom can keep his mouth shut about the dress the bride picks out (after agreeing on price and color scheme, which same goes for the groom's suit). \n\nJust don't engage with her on this anymore, certainly don't include her in any more wedding stuff (and make sure your vendors have passwords in case your MIL goes full crazy, because she is on the path) and let your fiance deal with her.", "Nah.

I wander if it is why the dress was so important to her. Sounds like she sees you as a daughter and had taken the rejection to heart as if you were rejecting her and everything she represent / connection to her (not justified obviously, the dress/compromise in her head being the representation of her). You are obviously not in the wrong here, and it seems to me that the problem is her own insecurity in the relationship/family dynamics in regards to your own family. In any case don't take it to heart, it is about her, not you. The fact that she wanted you to wear her wedding dress means that she cares for you a lot. She felt her, she lashed out, it was really wrong of her, but she might not have realised that you were not rejecting her. I don't know but your fianc\u00e9 should talk to his mum and reassure her. If she had been good until then, I hope you can forgive her for the sake of your future family life. Is your SIL married?

So she can participate and find ways to involve herself in supporting your planning or she can sit on the sidelines and attend as a guest, but there is no middle ground because this event will be planned to your taste and preferences as it is your wedding, your party and your day.", "NTA and if you do stand up for yourself now, it will be worse when you are married.", "NTA.

She\u2019s a spoiled drama queen trying to force a woman that isn\u2019t even her daughter to wear her dress! THIS incident has shown you who she truly is - as you didn\u2019t do what she wanted, she revealed her true nature. \n\nIgnore her tantrum - there is no reason why you should \u2018compromise\u2019 by doing exactly what she wants. \n\nNTA.", "Don\u2019t compromise. It\u2019s your wedding.", "Looks like she is finally showing her true colors", "She\u2019s either secretly a control freak and this is your first time crossing her or she envisioned this being a bonding moment for you and is not taking it well that this isn\u2019t the case. Unfortunately my bet is on the former rather than the latter as made evident with the fact that she would have been okay with similar styles if not her dress. She doesn\u2019t see you as future DIL, she sees you as her personal Barbie doll and she\u2019s now having a tantrum because her perceived toy has been taken from her. Maybe she is sweet but keep an eye on her because this isn\u2019t okay. Maybe she *was* sweet before you were locked in by an engagement and she doesn\u2019t feel the need to be on her best behavior anymore. Let your fianc\u00e9 handle her though and you worry about yourself. She can ride alone on her own power trip.", "This, absolutely this OP ^\n\nShe has her own daughter(s) to benefit from her dress being worn again, it\u2019s a ridiculous assumption of hers to think her DIL must wear her dress.  NTA", "Your MIL had a vision for YOUR wedding. She is delusional. She wanted to feel important and in her mind maybe she was saving you time and money. You are not a spoiled brat. It\u2019s okay to want what you want for your wedding and keep in line with your very own vision for your day (not MIL). \n\nYour MIL now has to process that you are your own person and can make your own choices and get over it. It will be hard for her and your SIL is siding with her. But you have done nothing wrong. Keep setting boundaries and stand firm for what you want for your day.", "And yet you wouldn't tell SIL she is an asshole for not getting married and losing weight so her mother's vision could be fulfilled.\n\nNTA", "then the mil should stop complaining", "Exactly. MIL already had her wedding and the opportunity to pick the dress she wanted. This is the Op's wedding . The dress choice is the op's. Op should stand her ground about this now because I see similar MIL tantrums in the future....like MIL expecting the op to take her opinion on how she furnishes her home, where her and her spouse buy a house , where holidays are celebrated and if the op and her spouse have kids - op can expect  tantrums on the usual  MIL antics like being allowed to be in the delivery room, naming the baby etc.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
