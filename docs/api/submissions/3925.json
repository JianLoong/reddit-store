So i apologise for all mistakes in advance. \n\nMy MIL who is usually very sweet and nice asked me to try on her wedding dress as she wanted to gift it to me for the wedding. I did not want to hurt her and so I tried on the dress (even though I knew that I wanted to buy my own dress). I fittet quite well and looked pretty but not what I was looking for at all. \nSo I thanked MIL for the opportunity and the gesture but that it was not what I envisioned myself wearing on my wedding day. But that she was welcome to join me and my mom the next day when we were looking for wedding dresses. \n\nShe joined us and I thought everything was fine. But during the shopping she tried to make me try on dresses similar to her weddingdress, but more my style. I tried two of her picks but stated that it was still not what I was looking for, even though I liked it a little better on me then her dress. And I thanked her for helping me. \n\nShe got quiet and only shrugged her shoulders over the other dresses I tried on. \nI finally found my dream dress, bought it (I am paying about 2000\u20ac and my parents payed about 300\u20ac for shoes and a veil. My In-laws don\u2019t pay anything towards the dress or the wedding) and then we went to eat lunch together. \n\nMIL was still unusually quite so i asked what was wrong and if I could help her. She shrugged her shoulders and said \u201cit\u2019s fine\u201d and I thought she needed a little time for her. So I started a conversation with my mom and started eating after we all got our food. We did not exclude her and tried to make her a part of our conversation. But she just shrugged and moped. \n\nA few minutes into lunch she said \u201cYou are a ungrateful spoiled brat.\u201d And I was utterly confused and asked why. That\u2019s what she said:\n\n\u201cI would have gifted you my dress but it wasn\u2019t good enough for little miss-I-want-a-new-dress. That\u2019s ungrateful. And i tried to find a compromise with a dress that matched our both tastes in a dress and you still denied all that. Your so ungrateful and impolite. Not even able to make a compromise.\u201d\n\nThen she stood up, paid for her meal and left without me being able to say anything. \n\nI asked my fianc\u00e9 later that day about it and he told me to not very as I did nothing wrong. But SIL texted me that I was an ungrateful asshole for hurting her mother this much and not compromising on anything. \n\nAITA?\n\nUpdate:\n\n1. My fianc\u00e9 already talked to her. I believe 3 or 4 days ago. But thanks for the suggestion \n\n2. My MIL called me just a few minutes ago to apologise. To me it sounded sincere. M\n\nShe told me that she was disappointed that day because she wanted to be a part of all that at my wedding day and she did not know how to ask since my parents already said they pay for my veil and shoes. And she knew that I don\u2019t were jewellery expect my engagement ring and a necklace my fianc\u00e9 gifted me 8 years ago, so she couldn\u2019t give something like this. And she did not want to gift me a garter, since she thought it inappropriate to gift her DIL something like that. And that she was hurt after trying to give input on my dress and was rejected. She apologised again and then asked to treat me and my mom to lunch tomorrow as an apology for her behave and that she wants to offer (if I am up for it) that she pays for my bridal bouquet. \n\n\nSo tomorrow we are going out for lunch and after that to a florist so I can show her the flowers I like and the idea I have for my bouquet. \n\nI thank you all for your judgments.", "created_utc": 1670158163, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc92p8/aita_for_not_wearing_my_mils_wedding_dress_and/", "score": 2114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sure, there are plenty of things that you could compromise with to make family happy, such as the guest list to include some of their friends, the menu to make sure key people have food they like, and certain traditions/ceremony components.

I wander if it is why the dress was so important to her. Sounds like she sees you as a daughter and had taken the rejection to heart as if you were rejecting her and everything she represent / connection to her (not justified obviously, the dress/compromise in her head being the representation of her). You are obviously not in the wrong here, and it seems to me that the problem is her own insecurity in the relationship/family dynamics in regards to your own family. In any case don't take it to heart, it is about her, not you. The fact that she wanted you to wear her wedding dress means that she cares for you a lot. She felt her, she lashed out, it was really wrong of her, but she might not have realised that you were not rejecting her. I don't know but your fianc\u00e9 should talk to his mum and reassure her. If she had been good until then, I hope you can forgive her for the sake of your future family life. Is your SIL married?

So she can participate and find ways to involve herself in supporting your planning or she can sit on the sidelines and attend as a guest, but there is no middle ground because this event will be planned to your taste and preferences as it is your wedding, your party and your day.", "NTA and if you do stand up for yourself now, it will be worse when you are married.", "NTA.
