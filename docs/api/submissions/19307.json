We have a child (2m). \n\nMy job is taking care of my disabled brother so my mother can work her job. Her job occasionally (once every four weeks) requires her to work the weekend. This has always been a slight issue here and there for my husband since she also has to work a holiday here and there. All of these weekends and holidays we know a year in advance.\n\nFor a few years i have had my mom switch weekends or take off when his family has had a party or something \u201cimportant\u201d. My in-laws are horrible at plans, everything is last minute. For years i have tried just to block weekends off to avoid issues or the stress of last minute planning. However it became clear that this was something that they were growing entitled to. That they assumed id do. It was expected. By everyone including my husband. This is no benefit to me or my mother. I do not get along with my in-laws and they haven\u2019t been the nicest to me or my family.\n\nIt really came ahead this last month. I turned 30. Traditionally (no matter the birthday) we have a party at our house. My husband\u2019s is the following month and again we have had parties at our house since we bought it. We have owned our house for 5 years. \n\nFor 4 out of 5 years my in-laws seem to always have plans for our birthdays. Doesn\u2019t matter when we have tried having. Offering to reschedule. Somehow they are always booked. And when my husband sees this behavior upsets me his response was \u201cwell they had these plans months ago before we technically planned anything\u201d my argument is birthdays are an annual thing, and they have expected me to block of or move around two people\u2019s work schedules for them. He said that he understands im upset but says i dont even like them and \u201cpeople cant just cancel or reschedule plans they have had for months\u201d. This honestly is why i dont like them. Not the only reason but it doesn\u2019t help.\n\nWell after this last birthday\u2026which was a milestone birthday\u2026i told him i would no longer be managing birthdays for his family. I wouldn\u2019t be the one remembering and purchasing gifts. But more importantly i would never rearrange the work and holiday schedules for them. That according to him: if there are plans months ahead of time then we are required or expected to cancel or reschedule them. And this work schedule is something i have a year\u2019s notice on. My husband says im an AH and that im preventing him and our child from seeing family (my husband\u2019s family lives hours away and he refuses to travel with our child by himself). I countered with that im using his logic and rules fairly and if he doesn\u2019t like it then tough. \n\nHe says it\u2019s not fair because it\u2019s abnormal for people to work weekends and holidays as often as my mother does. I kinda laughed at that. He says im being spiteful and im an AH. I say no. I am just following the same rules and leniencies as the rest of his family.", "created_utc": 1686236575, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144bnsn/wibtah_if_i_refuse_to_switch_weekends/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A neutral party may help you discuss these issues in a more productive way.", "NTA. \n\nYou are correct that birthdays are annual and not a surprise. His parents well and truly are choosing to commit to things other than your birthdays. And we the poor have always worked weekends, so I have no idea what this man means by it being abnormal to work \"this much\". Do not let him gaslight you. \n\nHas he always been this way or is this a more recent development in his personality? I would highly advise couples therapy either way but let it be a lesson in red flags in relationships if he has always been this way.", "NTA \n\nIt's abnormal for people to work weekends?!? Weird, last time I checked, most stores and restaurants and entertainment venues are the busiest on the weekend, hence the higher staff ratios. And hospitals are busier too. And emergency services are still working. And people are still getting their electricity,  water, and sewage. I guess all that is just a figment of my imagination since it's abnormal for people to work weekends.  \n\nIt's his family. He can do all the arrangements for that side. Wash your hands of it. If he wants your child to see his side of the family, then he can do the traveling. Plan your events as you see fit, with what works with your schedule.  If they fail to show, it's on them.", "NTA and their entitled asses. Fuck your husband too, with his double standards. \n\nLike you said, you're using his logic and reasoning. Why should you keep moving things around for in-laws that are AHs to you, people you don't like anyway, when you have a year's advanced notice on weekends anyway? \n\nNTA op, NTA.", "NTA - As someone who also had assumed the mantle of taking care of all planning, birthdays, and gift purchasing for my family and my now ex's, I really think the default should be each partner takes care of their own family. If as part of the division of labour in your household you want to do all of this, then it should be an opt-in, and gratefully appreciated!\n\nRegarding scheduling, your husband and his family appear to be petulant twats who only want things their own way, and even with your schedule known a year in advance, they all choose to cause problems rather than cooperate. Good on you for calling out their hypocrisy. You are setting a solid and extremely reasonable boundary. \n\nHis refusal to travel by himself with your child shows that he expects you to do everything and has entrenched himself in his own incompetence. \n\nThe only spite being exhibited here is from him and his family. They are fairly soaking in it.\n\nAll the best to you OP!", "NTA your husband can take your kid and see his family without you, how are you preventing him from seeing his family? Ots his choice not to go, not yours. And I did the same thing with my husband years ago - why should I be in charge of his family? Nope", "NTA - he honestly thinks \"it\u2019s abnormal for people to work weekends and holidays\"??  I'd let him know that if he really thinks that, he should stop doing everything on weekends.  No grocery shopping, no golf, no movies, no oil changes, no anything.  **The world only runs because people work weekends.**  And many of them work EVERY weekend.  I worked in a call center and worked 10am-9pm every Saturday plus 3-4 major holidays every year.\n\nYour husband is spoiled and doesn't like being held to his own rules.  I suggest making an iCalendar or one on Google that can be shared with his family so that everyone can see exactly when you are and are not available.

Telling your husband to manage the birthday gifts, etc. for his family is also fair. Expecting your husband to occasionally drive the kids to his parents for a visit, I agree with that too. In your place, I would **go ahead and make those small changes in behaviour---but without some big \"announcement\" or confrontation about it.**\n\nYour in-laws not blocking out their calendars every single year for those birthdays...uh, I get that too, they can have their own active social lives. At some point, the birthdays for your adult kids probably drop in priority (especially if you still see them fairly frequently).  They can be last-minute planners---but they can't get upset or mad when others don't participate.\n\nYour husband is trying to straddle the line here.

I do.\n\nBut it's also a situation that's easily handled: send out the invitation EARLY. This doesn't need to be a situation that destroys your family..", "Thank you for clarifying. I\u2019m going to be honest, I think you\u2019re taking it a tiny bit too personally, at least for grownup birthdays.

I dont need gifts but it be nice if the contributed food or drinks. Instead if they do come they take half our leftovers home for themselves.", "I\u2019m sure your in laws expect you to send out invitations for your funeral as well. They sound awful", "Well, I know it hurt your feelings, but realistically, your son won\u2019t remember. \n\nAs for bringing food, you could definitely send the invite specifically notating \u201cbring a dish to pass\u201d. Another idea is \u2026 non-leftover parties. If that makes sense. Hard to take a sloppy joe home. Hard to take a smoothie home. Hard to take soup home unless they\u2019re bringing Gladware with them. What about a drinks-only party? Just some ideas because that would annoy me too."]}
