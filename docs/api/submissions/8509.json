How we understand sexuality is very different now, and we got here by learning.\n\nThe idea that sexuality, like many things that people did in their teens and 20s  was a phase, was prevalent through the 1970s and 1990s. They appear to have accepted their grandson which is a big deal for the time. Not everyone was that lucky.\n\nGive her a chance to understand why what she said was hurtful.
