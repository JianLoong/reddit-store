People don't easily change their minds. But they can. \n\n OP is dealing with someone who was born in the early 1940s and when they were 40, it was progressive to tolerate gay people. Hell it wasn't in people's radar. Even though it was in the title, it was not common knowledge that Freddy Mercury was gay, even Liberace, seriously, lots of people didn't know. How we understand sexuality is very different now, and we got here by learning.\n\nThe idea that sexuality, like many things that people did in their teens and 20s  was a phase, was prevalent through the 1970s and 1990s. They appear to have accepted their grandson which is a big deal for the time. Not everyone was that lucky.\n\nGive her a chance to understand why what she said was hurtful. She seems him as straight now since he's marrying a woman, the nuance that he's still bi is lost in her.", "Oof yeah that's a really good point. You're right.", "NTA.  calvin is clearly marrying up and he\u2019s super grateful for it.", "NTA\n\nGrandma to proud to apologize. No wedding for her.", "NTA. Normally I\u2019d be hesitant to support someone making a decision about their partner\u2019s family with no discussion, but in this case, the bigotry needed to be called out. You needed to show what kind of family you are and what you\u2019re not willing to tolerate.", "NTA. no matter how you look at it, things would have turned out the same. At least now he knows you will always support him and won't be quiet about it. \n\nWish you luck and many years of happiness!", "NTA, and don't feel guilty. You were right to challenge that loathsome bigot. \n\nAnd Calvin is right: block Grandma from attending the wedding. I'd block his mother, too, but that's just me. \n\nBest wishes and good luck to your both.", "NTA. Good job standing up for your fiance, but at the end of the day it is his call I think, and if he doesn't want her there, that's the decision.", "NTA\n\nAnyone who is arguing against what you did, does not have your boyfriend's best interest at heart. It sounds like the number of people you might need to invite to the wedding is decreasing.", "What could have been her motive for doing what she did?", "NTA. Your wedding is supposed to be about you and your fiance, and you have the right to not invite anyone that make you uncofortable. And, if the others of the family think the same way as the grandmother, i woldnt want then if it was my wedding either.", "NTA. \nBut screaming at someone isn't usually the best way to handle the situation.  Maybe if you had stayed calmer, you could have educated her and not alienated the whole family.", "Yup. You're the  AH. You should've let Calvin handle it his own way. It's his family. His feelings that got hurt. You just need to support him in whatever decision he makes. I'm sure you thought you were defending the one u love. But all you did was make an ant hill into a volcano. It's his wedding too.", "NTA - good for you. You went full protective mode. I love it. There are no peacemaker in couple. Just people who demand to be treated with respect.", "NTA", "Great job OP for backing your fiance from his bigot of a grandmother.  There is nothing wrong with telling a bigot off and putting them in their place.\n\nThat said, OP needs to ask herself a few questions:\n\nWith the treatment she has received over this, does she really want a big wedding?  Would she be better off eloping or going to the justice of the peace (or something similar).  Something tells me having a very small wedding or eloping would save OP and fiance a whole lot of drama here.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nunpleasant old cow is just getting the cold shoulder treatment she deserves. She needed the wake up call and so does everyone else - who should be warned that grandmother is not the only person who can be uninvited if they can\u2019t be civilised to both of the people getting married.   \nstart how you mean to continue - basic respect for other human beings is non-negotiable.", "NTA. The grandmother was rude and homophobic and doesn\u2019t appear to have any regrets. Being old isn\u2019t a free pass to be an asshole.", "NTA. \n\nIn fact, OP you\u2019re a freakin rock star! I love what you did.", "Absolutely NTA and Calvin is one lucky person to have someone so firmly in their corner.", "NTA\n\nYou are awesome for standing up for your partner and being supportive for him.\n\nHis grandmother did this to herself. What a disgusting homophobe.\n\nFrankly anyone taking the grandmother's side, I wouldn't invite to the wedding either.", "NTA. Sounds like the mum, aunts, and uncles shouldn\u2019t come to the wedding either.", "NTA and whomever agrees or defends her can join her. Congratulations on your engagement. Wishing you both many years of happiness.", "Everyone the A-hole here, except Calvin of course.  For Pete's sake girl, hold that tongue and temper!  I'm not saying you weren't right in your anger, but there is a time and place (and after you talk to your fiance).  You make decisions together.  You just ostracized the whole damn family!  Not the way the start a marriage or ongoing relations with their in-laws.  I am in no way excusing grandma's behavior, but ignorance makes you say stupid stuff.  Maybe Calvin could have had a powerful conversation with his grandmother about how much it hurt him, and the family would have stayed intact.  AND, I think in the long run, Calvin may regret not having his grandmother at his wedding.  Perhaps they need to go to lunch and talk...ALONE.", "I said this in another post on another issue, bigots deserve no quarter.NTA.", "NTA; however, this is going to cast a big shadow over the wedding itself.  Have you two considered an elopement so your actual wedding can be stress and drama free, followed by a big party where you don\u2019t invite all those people who have caused this hurt and stress?  It\u2019s easier to deal with stress over a party than over the wedding.  An elopement would allow your big day to just be about the two of you.", "Here's the thing, did she ask Calvin what he felt? Did Calvin ask her to defend him?She went off on his behalf, but it doesn't seem like he wanted it handled that way. Remember this is about HIM, not her. YTA", "NTA Homophobia isn't just an opinion and shouldn't be allowed in weddings of any kind. Weddings are a celebration of love and homophobia is hate speech. Normalize cutting off bigots from family events.", "NTA\n\nGood for you! Stand up for your future husband!!  Be the support he needs when the winds are too strong for him.\n\nFuck his mom though too, she can go choke on a weird crooked dick next to the grandma.", "My thoughts are another heart to heart convo with your partner about his desires and thoughts. \n\nWhat she said was inappropriate, but the decision to uninvite her and create this rift I think would have been better made with you both together at the same time as a united front. Now they have all the anger on you. This is generational type stuff.\n\nIt sounds like he was having big feelings about it, and while sided with you, you def want to make sure that's his true feeling about it. Ultimately yes it's absolutely about what you both desire. \n\nPersonally would have been super funny for you to exclaim that neither of you would be giving up men and that you would both continue banging men in an open marriage with threesomes...but hey, may have given them a heart attack. Still...a dinner for the ages.", "NTA. You are a wonderful and supportive fianc\u00e9 to stand up for him the way you did. You didn\u2019t reprimand her in public, you waited until you were home. His family sounds awful and you don\u2019t need any of the nasty ones at your wedding, especially the grandmother. What she said was so uncalled for and over the top. Shame on her and shame on anyone on her side.", "Nah !", "YTA. I can't imagine screaming at my GF's grandma over anything, especially something like this. Every little thing isn't the end of the world and cause for yelling and assholery. I have no doubt Calvin said he agreed with you cause it's clear how you'd act if he said he didn't. Calvin needs to grow up and stand up for himself whether it's his Grandma or especially you OP", "ESH. Grandma made a rude comment, but you come across as unhinged with your fit of rage and you look overly controlling by making a unilateral decision to uninvited HIS grandma. Also, Calvin  needs therapy or a new backbone if he just sits back and lets you fight all his battles \u2026 or is it that you treat Calvin this way too, and he just cannot go against you? I wonder why he cried all day. Is it really because he was upset with \u201ceverything his family said\u201d (when it was only grandma and you fighting?) or because you embarrassed the f out of him too? Can Calvin really make up his own mind around you, or does he have to do what you want or risk your wrath? It\u2019s really telling that Calvin didn\u2019t talk to you (the big hero /s) the rest of the night and that he even refused to talk to you while sobbing. In moments of vulnerability, people do not open up to those who do not make them feel safe or comfortable.", "> This is all about you two, and when you two are on the same page, everyone else can either be nice or fuck off.\n\nExcept OP *didn't know* they'd be on the same page when she acted.  She just got lucky.  I get that homophobes get people clamoring for the N, T, and A keys, but we should stop to realize that speaking and acting for your partner before gauging his opinion on the matter can be a recipe for disaster.", "Ans geriatric bigots shouldn't get a pass.", "I'd be texting images of a wedding invite with their names on it going through the shredder! They can stay home and be hateful with grandma, defending her bullshit would automatically get you summarily evicted from my entire life, let alone the wedding. No apologies necessary since I'd never talk to grandma or her cronies again.", "If you can't imagine yourself  defending your loved one after bigotry....that's not great.", "I disagree most strongly. We grandmas work on ourselves all the time (or don\u2019t) - it\u2019s not related to age or grandparenthood.

Okay, feel free to live your life that way.", "My grandmother was 88 when my kid came out as trans.

That is why the smart thing to do is start working on your retirement early so when you can no longer work you still feel engaged.
