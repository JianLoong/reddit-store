Whether her reasoning for saying no is because she wants to go on the trip because she thinks you are going to that stupidly overpriced park or because of her own reasons is irrelevant (unless her reason is because you want her to do this for free).

It\u2019s not your daughter\u2019s responsibility to watch your pets while you\u2019re away. It does not matter if it\u2019s for family reasons or not.

But you\u2019ve explained to her it\u2019s not a vacation, but have you asked her why she wants to go, and what she plans to do with her time there while you\u2019re watching the competition? Maybe she wants to watch her sister? Maybe she doesn\u2019t and wants to roam the park? This needs to be known to find out what the real deal is instead of you guessing (\u201cwhich is why I THINK older daughter has a problem with it\u201d). \n\nHowever. The other issue is what to do with the dogs? What would you do if both daughters were with you and your husband on vacation?  Find another relative or close friend to watch them perhaps.

Maybe sweeten the pot by offering to pay her and reiterate that you guys aren't going for vacation but a competition, which leaves little to no time for relaxation.", "NTA. As a mom of adult children, I understand how you feel. We do everything for our kids even when they are adults. To ask them to do a favor and them telling us NO is VERY annoying and selfish.

When it comes to family and friends, you treat people how you want to be treated AND how they have treated you. So if my parents ask me for a favor, I am happy to do it because they have done me a ton of favors, and still do. \n\nI imagine your daughter is still going to expect free vacations, free food, and help from you in other ways, and at 22 she certainly understands that actions have consequences. By not watching the dogs because she is hurt she doesn't get to go, she is changing the dynamic of what you can expect of her, but also hope you adjust what she expects of you accordingly. She is hurt she isn't invited on the trip, but you have a very valid reason for that and it isn't about excluding her, it is about both parents being there for a child. \n\nI hope you are able to find a friend to help, and I hope you make it clear to your daughter that she should expect the same kind of help from you that she gives to you- not much.", "Pay her to do it and see if her tune changes.", "YTA why can't you stay and let your husband go for a change ?", "YTA. We have a dog that can't  be boarded, so when we travel, we Iiterally have to pay someone to come stay at our home with the dog. \n\nIf your older daughter is supporting herself with the fast food job there's no way that she could afford a trip to Disney World. I can see why she whould be a bit jealous. Has your older daughter ever even been to Disney world? Are you going to Disney World after the competition with your younger daughter and without your older daughter? If that's the case I can understand her being really upset.\n\nMy daughter went to gymnastics world competition a Disney more than once, so I understand the commitment that you're making here. It's not unusual in this situation for team members to stay an extra day after competition and spend the day at Disney World since they're already there. I keep wondering if this is what you're doing, and without the older daughter?

Either you have never been before or you\u2019re being intentionally daft to leave out your daughter. It can be very vacation-y. There\u2019s a ton of downtime where teams often go do fun things with each other. During that downtime, you and your husband could go and do stuff around the park with your other daughter while the younger is with her team. In fact it\u2019s pretty normal for those families to bring their other children so they don\u2019t have to sit HOURS at the venue waiting for their child\u2019s 2 minute and 30 second routine. Not to mention it\u2019s a multiple day competition, so you have nights that you could be doing \u201cvacation\u201d things too. Otherwise we\u2019re you just planning on sitting in your hotel? Yeah no. Didn\u2019t think so. Your younger daughter will be with her team most of the time and you and your husband will be in the park with nothing to do except: enjoy the park. I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t ask your older daughter to come with you? Why are you intentionally excluding her? YTA and I saw another comment that said you were a chaperone for the team.

I know you said you do cause you\u2019re the \u201cteam mom\u201d But I know you\u2019re not the only one and I know that dad could step in.

Tells much, don't you think?", "Then don't bring her, but she still can say no to dogsitting.\n\nYour daughter is either family enough for you guys to do each other kind things just because, or she's not.

Mom's house is closer to the oldest daughter's place of employment. How could she possibly say no to that?!", "If the oldest daughter already stays there for multiple days, it's closer to her work, and she likes the dogs I don't see why she wouldn't stay over to watch them. She's acting like they're going on vacation w/out her when they're not, especially since they went as a family to Disney the last year. It seems like the oldest is just being a brat imo. One of the dogs needs special attention, and on top of that another was injured when they boarded them previously, so I understand why they want someone who knows and likes the dogs and vice versa to watch them.", "In that case it's either a dog sitter or you go alone.", "Then I\u2019d say NTA.

They went on a family trip the year before, and the daughter stays at the house for days at a time with no issue.\n\n I agree the daughter has the right to say no, and the mom has the right to do the competition and not take the older daughter.

Of course they consider her family - They asked her to dog sit because they thought it would fit with her existing schedule and that she would have no interest in going, same as always. When she said no, they backed off. They\u2019re annoyed because they feel like it wouldn\u2019t be all that inconvenient for her to help out and that her reasons for saying no are petty. I disagree with that assessment - I think she feels hurt and excluded and maybe OP needs to rethink their approach.

No. Because that would be ridiculous.", "IMO OP included details so you or anyone else wouldn't have to assume or ask for more info about that.

She\u2019d have to swing by once a day to feed my kitty and give her some attention, I would spring for a self cleaning littler box if I was leaving for 5 days so she wouldn\u2019t even need to scoop for me. And I would still pay her for that time.\n\nYou, on the other hand, are asking your daughter to fully rearrange her life to look after your *3* dogs. You want her to walk them, clean up after them, feed them, socialize them, and be with them as often as she can so your anxious one doesn\u2019t freak out. But you respect your daughter so little that you don\u2019t think she deserves compensation for giving you that much of her time to help you out.

Otherwise they are sitting in a performance area for 8 hours watching 2 minute routines over and over. I don\u2019t know if OP has never been before or what but they\u2019re leaving out a lot to make them not look bad.
