Wife worked before kids and after we had our first. But sporadically, not in stable jobs. After our second, she could have carried on working but childcare was almost as much as she was earning and she didn't want to be away from the children. I was offered a job with very unsociable hours that I could have taken. Would have let her work too but she didnt want to.\n\nContinued after the third. I was happy for her to go back to work and we'd juggle childcare but she didn't want to. So she stayed home with them.\n\nShe's been working for almost a year. But now she's in a fixed position. \n\nI've had to go in to work for about a year but I've always dropped the kids and left work early to pick them up, then made up the time in the evening. I always drop off the kids, even when she's not working.\n\nAnd for those wondering why we don't combine finances, I've always been the primary earner. So I take on bills according to my salary because I know we can afford them.

Mental load counts too, so time spent planning activities for the kids and making shopping lists ads up too. The division might not be as equal as you think. It rarely is.\nIf the division of chores and mental load is truly equal you leave it as is, otherwise have a conversation about if you both are okay with keeping it as it is or if you there are improvements to be made.

Both of our money gets deposited into our account and all bills are paid out of it. Whatever is left we discuss how to divide. We make sure we can pay all bills on his salary for financial security but never ever from the point of view that it\u2019s \u201chis\u201d. If we didn\u2019t go over our budget every month to keep track of expenses we wouldn\u2019t even know who made what.\n\nI\u2019m both very thankful my husband does not think the way that you do and if he did, well, he wouldn\u2019t be my husband for much longer without making some changes. It would either be \u201cfine, I\u2019ll take a full time job and we can split everything equally, you need to meal plan get the groceries and do the laundry and dinner clean up as well as baths and bedtime this week\u201d or \u201coh, I didn\u2019t realize you wanted to use your finances to control my behavior.

If you don't want to 100% combine finances, at least open a joint account and throw a certain percentage of each of your earnings into it.

Then nobody is \"the one\" paying for childcare and all this bitterness goes away", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re hearing what anyone is saying. \n\nShe\u2019s already forfeited years of earning so YOU could work full time.  \n\nYou guys really need to sit down together and re-think your split finances.  You are nickel and diming a person who gave up an entire salary to avoid a shared cost, with concomitant costs in career development opportunities. \n\nThis is the base problem with split finances. You\u2019re ignoring opportunity costs when it benefits you.", "You're just not getting it, no matter how many times someone tells you. Both of your incomes belong to the family. They should be put in one pot with all of the bills being paid out of it/money put in savings, etc. Each of you could draw an allowance for any personal spending, but it should be equal amounts.

How can you hold making more money over someone when they gave up so many years of their career advancement to save you money. Maybe she SHOULD contribute more financially now but you should talk about it as partners not you tell her what to do.", "YTA. You\u2019re punishing her for going back to work by asking her to pay for 100% of the childcare since she\u2019s no longer home 24/7 to look after your children.", "Or she could pay an equitable amount. Like if she makes 1/3 of what you make then she would pay 1/3 of the bills. Idk your careers, but it's a lot easier to advance in your career if you are at it consistently rather than working on and off while having babies and raising a family. All of that work she has done is of MAJOR value to your family and your children.", "You're missing the point. It's not a \"she\" it's a \"we.\" Implying that your wife's financial stability isn't also your financial stability is so odd. Especially after a decade of marriage and 3 kids. Get a joint account, put all your money in it, and then pay bills from that. Then it doesn't matter who makes what. Marriage is a partnership, not roommates arguing over bills.", "Bruh.

I've seen you comment that quite a bit already and it doesn't make any sense.", "Maybe, but that's ok too. I am just saying that all income has to be budgeted fairly for the well being of all. Major decisions should be made together but each of you should have a certain amount of diddle money as well, for personal expenses, presents, etc. \n\nIt absolutely drives me wild when one person says, \"It's my money and I can spend it as I wish\" or \"I earn more so I can buy more luxury items.\" One of my personal favourite posts was the guy who went alone on a holiday because his wife couldn't afford it.", "I mean as a team. Money goes into one pot and you take it from combined pot. Like all expenses.", "Her role was always less flexible. Like other people have said, yours is the job that changed.

She no longer has to ask him for money for things. Getting her to pay childcare costs is a way to reduce her income and get her reliant on him again.

Like what do couple like this think is going to happen when retirement age hits?! I understand keeping some stuff separate just as a precaution, but why would you want to watch your spouse struggle?

It's *our* home and family. When I was unemployed and the dog I desperately wanted needed food it wasn't even a question for my partner. When he was recovering from unemployment I didn't think twice about filling his gas tank. And keep in mind these examples are from when we first moved in together, how can OP be so fucking cold to *the mother of his children?!*\n\nTo be honest, I've never seen a couple with this attitude towards finances survive happily.

It makes no sense except that she's the mom and that you dont help pay for it. Your other agreements are kind of moot, especially if there is plenty left after you pay the other bills. Your work situation changed most recently, resulting in the need for childcare...so by that standard, it's on you.", "And that\u2019s not even considering the fact that the way OP is talking about his wife staying home with the children is as if it were a welcome reprieve for her from work lol.

He is just wanting financial control", "Yup! Chauffer, laundry service, cleaner, assistant, chef, personal shopper, childcare.

It's not a big amount of money, and we're both aware of the accounts and how much is going into them. Is that a system that would work for everyone? No. It's what works for us and what we agreed to do when we sat down and made the budget, what adults in partnerships do. \n\nWe don't have children but if we did, their expenses would come out of the joint account just like our housing and food do. \n\nThese people have been married ten years and haven't figured out a financial system that works for them.
