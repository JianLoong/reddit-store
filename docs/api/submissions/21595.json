Gee, I wonder why she's single.", "**NTA**\n\nReal friendship is sometimes saying the hard things, and that's just what you did. You didn't undermine her success, her education, her looks, etc. She sure did that to you though, and it is not even close to the same thing. To say that you only have what you do only because you are pretty and artistic? Bullshit. I've known plenty of pretty and artistic girls that are still single/divorced (also in my early 30s) and don't have degrees or careers because they either are jerks or have no work ethic. Sure, being pretty can help in some situations, but it also hinders in others.  \n\nHonestly, I would think about making her into an acquaintance over a close friend. She sounds like she is determined to make her own life miserable by having such unbending standards and stipulations and will obviously lash out her insecurities in a vindictive manner.", "Definitely a justified asshole after she just reduced all your successes in life to being 'pretty'. \n\nCan't say that level of pettiness is a sought for quality in friendship or romance.\n\nNTA", "How odd that she deserves an apology for an \"insensitive\" comment but you don't deserve one when she made a comment about how you got everything because of your looks. She dismissed you(all your hard work, all your effort, all your milestones)based on your appearance. This is not a friend. NTA", " \"it\u2019s hard being single\"  \n\n\nI mean as someone who hates being single, it seems a hella lot easier than the easiest of relationships.", "NTA. I had a friend like that when I was 30. Her demands are pretty much a guarantee that she'll never find anyone who meets all these criteria. What you said to her was fair and not mean or \"insensitive\" or especially an \"asshole move.\" If this is how she reacts to hearing something other than what she wants to hear -- well, then. Good luck with all that. You certainly don't owe anyone an apology just because they are unhappy with where they positioned themselves in their life and take it out on you while falsely claiming that you started it.", "It is hard being single in your 30\u2019s feels like everyone already found someone and the ones that are single there\u2019s a good reason why. I agree with you the education thing and not being married before is a bit stupid, wanting someone with a similar level income and no kids isn\u2019t unreasonable as those things can make a relationship very different. I think NTA, she was saying to you that because you\u2019re pretty you got stuff which I think is out of order, what you said about college and salary I don\u2019t think is unreasonable.", "By the way, you will always be the AH for speaking the truth when the person you\u2019re speaking to hides behind a veil. They don\u2019t want to hear or see ANYTHING for what it really is.", "NTA. People who have a big list of requirements for a future spouse should start with the number of people in their city, take out half for being the wrong gender, take out the number who are married or not their sexual orientation, and continue reducing the number until they get to what is left. She is likely to find there are very few people in her area who meet her qualifications. Take out the ones who are left who would t marry an asshole like her, and she may find there is no one left.", "NTA, but realistically you are fighting against nature and you will not win the argument no matter how logical your points are. Many, if not most, younger successful women looking for serious relationships have a visceral, almost wired-in aversion to dating below their economic and educational level. To be clear I am talking about women looking for serious, committed, potentially marriage-oriented relationships, not one-night stands and hookups.\n\nHaving said this, she does have a point about her chances vs yours if she is not all that \"conventionally attractive\". Beauty is a HUGE advantage across the board for young women regardless of their economic and educational status, and it is intensely annoying when people who are pretty claim that being attractive has had little to nothing to do with their economic or relationship success in life.\n\nIn any event, there is nothing you can do to help her. The high-earning, college-educated, never married childless, 30-something men your 30-year-old friend seeks do not care all that much about women's educational level or earning ability. They want reasonably intelligent, attractive, pleasant women who are nice to them. Their fishing pond is 100X larger than your friends.\n\nShe is not the only one in this position. As women's earnings and educational levels have increased substantially over the past several decades, they (unlike men) will NOT easily go down the economic and educational ladder for mates *until* they age out of being able to have children, at which point their acceptable mate options narrow to a vanishing point. At that stage, their priorities often rearrange, and dating a successful, divorced plumber becomes a viable option.", "ESH I'm assuming you've been married or at least with your partner for a few years- dating in your 30s is much different than in your early 20s, so your experiences aren't exactly similar. \n\nWhile pretty privilege is a thing it was unnecessary for her to go there. So yea, you were both shitty friends that night.", "NTA, you kept it real with her and she didn\u2019t like it because she would rather believe that she is entitled to/will find a man that checks all her (largely superficial) boxes.", "NTA, but your friend does have reasonable requirements; depending on where you live, a new college grad can easily make six figures in their first job, so her expectations aren't out of line and she's only asking for criteria she meets herself. Just because education and income weren't important to you, doesn't mean she has to feel the same way. She was horrible to say you only have your success because of your looks though, that would be enough to reevaluate the friendship if she doesn't realize how wrong that was.", "NTA\n\nJudging someone \"value\" as a partner on their levels of education and income is quite shallow.", "Nta, her problem isn't HER standards, it's other people's standards of not wanting to date a total jerk.", "You both kind of suck for not speaking kindly to one another, but you're more the asshole here. If she's looking for someone who matches what she has to offer that's fine. You feeling a certain type of way about her wanting an equally successful partner and taking it out on her is the AH move here. YTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She refuses to date anyone that doesn\u2019t have a college degree, isn\u2019t making six figures, ...\" ... **What does SHE bring to the table?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat kind of degree does SHE have?", "Info. How pretty are you?", "NTA but she is. And she clearly wants to keep her dumb, superficial list of requirements so she can complain about how somehow she's been short shifted while people like you get it all without doing anything. Don't understand why your friends want you to apologize for not lying to her but I definitely understand why she is single.", "NTA. She's going to be single for a long time.

Maybe you were tired of listening to her complaining and finally said what was on your mind... and she retaliated in kind. And now ur in a fight. I guess the question now is how good a friend is she to you (and vice versa)- but honestly, the standards she chooses to hold her date up on is her choice. She lives with it everyday- you calling it out was you being annoyed by her since I can't imagine most ppl would just change their minds on their friends' say-so", "NTA\n\nWhen she's alone at 40 she will likely need to re-evaluate her high standards.", "NTA, no wonder she\u2019s single", "NTA, by a long shot.\n\nAlso, even if she *were* to find someone who somehow manages to meet all the criteria in the beginning, who\u2019s to say she won\u2019t immediately dump them as soon as they can\u2019t meet one of the criteria?\n\nJobs aren\u2019t always permanent, so would she dump the man who used to be making 6 figures as soon as/if he loses the job?\n\nEither way, you need to be rid of her.", "NTA and why did she need to involve other people? Absurd.", "Sounds like you have three friends to ditch.\n\nNTA", "NTA, refer her to a plastic surgeon and tell her to get back out there. Her singleness couldn\u2019t be due to her personality or victimhood or her short temper, that\u2019s for sure!", "Ladies I don't want to be so blunt...guys who have a degree...make 6 figs...don't have children...haven't been married...they date early 20s girls.   Once you 30s those standards will crush those dreams.", "[deleted]", "She is, not you.\n\nI know she's your friend, but I laugh at women like her who got more than they bargained for. She wanted the future to be female, now she's got it. Men aren't doing very well in our feminized society, and she has nothing to offer. Her college degree doesn't mean anything to a man. It's probably even a negative. It means she think she's smarter than she is. Education isn't intelligence. The 100k is nice, but she's not giving that away for free. She wants more than 100k in return! And she can probably get it. There are a lot of men with more money than brains who will just give it to her. But she's not going to have a real soul mate type relationship with a pay pig. A legitimate man who earns more than 100k is out of her league. She needs a down to earth blue collar guy who gets by with odd jobs. She provides the steady income. That's what she signed up with with her fancy degree, right? The man provides everything she can't on her own. Excitement. He can fix things around the house, make things for her, teach the kids, dwindle away her money on frivolous get rich quick schemes, I don't know. What's she going to do with $200k that she won't do with $100k? She needs someone independent with ideas that can keep them dreaming of millionaire success even if they probably won't get it.\n\nLook at birds. The Peacock has bright ridiculous colors. The peahen is drab and subdued.\n\nShe is right that physical attractiveness is massive and you're downplaying it. You probably don't want to admit to yourself that your husband and job had a lot to do with it. But you weren't saying that and were't out of line about anything. She was. She's probably right in assessing herself as ugly, but I'll bet she's also frumpy, as in she wears baggy clothes, has a non-feminine haircut thinking she can be taken seriously as an imitation man, only to be resentful when it makes things worse not better. She is not playing to her strengths. Men will fall in love with ugly women if they are not ugly on the inside too. They see her and they see divorce on the horizon. I'm surprised she didn't demand that her man must also be a feminist Democrat. Tell her to lift weights and stop eating high carb.", "Tell her she\u2019d better simmer down if she wants a 1%er. \nRecommend that she listen to Fresh and Fit podcast.\nA man wants a woman who need him for dependency; Not one that feels like she\u2019s is already at the top without him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel like this is the same one but things switched around and other details left out. Anyone else remember the one I\u2019m talking about? I believe the person got voted Y T A", "NTA.  I know someone that is almost 60\u2026never married, no kids.  She thinks that someone (now at her age) is going to waltz in and sweep her off her feet when she makes it well known to everyone that she has a good income and no man can take care of her as good as she takes care of herself.  She only hangs with a very small group of people and she has literally let herself go.  She wonders why she is still single.  Uh\u2026no man really wants to feel like they are in a competition when they are looking for companionship.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\" She refuses to date anyone that doesn\u2019t have a college degree, isn\u2019t making six figures, can\u2019t have kids, can\u2019t have been married before\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshe just dropped her dating pool to under 1% of men.....", "ESH.\n\nYou\u2019re definitely right about her standards.\n\nAnd if you think your looks don\u2019t directly correlate to conventional success in your relationships and career, you\u2019re deluding yourself.  This is backed up by loads of studies.\n\nYou can burst her bubble, then she can burst yours.  \n\nYou can be annoyed at her hypocrisy and you she can be annoyed at yours.\n\nSee how this works?", "NTA. Your friend is a snob and lashed out when you tried offering realistic advice. My wife and i don't make 6 figures and are quite happy. After reading your story, I'm thinking her single status isn't about your transient city, her looks, or her requirements. I think she probably just chases men away by being a turd.", "Someone who really loves you won't mind your salary nor educational credentials.", "ESH, pretty privilege is absolutely a thing. You really went after her first and then you both escalated it. She was venting her experience, there was no reason to take it personally. You judge her for her standards. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her expecting her partner to be at her level. There\u2019s nothing wrong with someone not having a degree or making less money, but when she has those things and wants someone who can provide a similar lifestyle that\u2019s her right. It doesn\u2019t make her an asshole.", "NTA.  She's probably single because she's a beach.", "NTA, your friend seems entitled and exhausting", "NTA. Aside from the list of things she wants in a partner I think is her attitude that is not getting her dates. Also, I know a lot of \u201cpretty\u201d girls who are in bad relationships, single or unemployed so that has nothing to do with how you got all you have.", "NTA. You were having a conversation and she personally attacked you. She is jealous of you and your success. If you really care about her as a friend and this is an outlier kind of situation, then tell her she hurt you by personally attacking you and reducing you to your looks. But she is the one who should be apologizing.", "NTA Your friend has issues and she was awful to you.", "I would have let the friend's comments slide. She can have whatever standards she likes and live with the results.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n\nGee I wonder why your friend is single\u2026/s.", "If all she has is her degree and salary as her personality, no wonder she is single.\n\nNTA\n\nFunny how she needs an apology but you don't?!", "NTA, sounds like her making 6 figures doesn\u2019t make up for being a shallow ass", "NTA\n\nTbh, you could probably have stood to be more of an asshole about it, yeesh.", "NTA. Your friends, however, seem to think that being pretty and having common sense makes you TA.", "What is a \"transient city\"? All I can think of would be Vegas?", "I would suggest just stop talking to her for a while. Lc and then you will see what you want. Personally I would just go NC with her and move on.\nEither way.. Nta.", "NTA", "So she is essentially saying that you have no real talent or ability - you made it solely on your good looks? Like you\u2019re an empty shell of a person? Yet apparently interesting to be with and talk to enough to be a good friend. That is insulting. She is not a good friend who sees you as a peer and mutual support system. Yes it is hard being single but she has no valid justification- the Ven diagram of those worthy and eligible for her is basically zero. NTA", "NTA. With an attitude like that she seems uglier on the inside than outside.", "No.\n\nOkay so you got your job because you're attractive. What job does she have that she didn't get just for being female, let alone an unattractive female? That's total privilege. There's some benefit to having pretty people around. There's no benefit to women getting jobs just to make the numbers right. That's absolutely harmful. Some of the privilege given to you trickled down to her. Is she in STEM? She went to school to learn how test tubes have a phallic shape because men wanted to scare the women away. Her husband racked his brain with differential equations to figure out how to get an airplane propeller to be .01% more efficient. Wow that's a match made in heaven. So much in common! What do they talk about first? She makes $100k a year and I guarantee she still has zero savings. She spends it all on Netflicks and cake. There's just so many good shows she can't help it. There's this new one that's about fighting the patriarchy. Move over men! Can't put this one down!", "NTA. Sounds like her attitude is the reason she\u2019s single.", "Well, bless her heart...\n\nOP - You're NTA", "NTA- time to cut this friend loose.  She sounds unhappy and unpleasant", "NTA. People have insane standards for dating. Honestly I think it\u2019s best to call them on their bullshit.", "NTA, girl I have been there!!! I actually cut out the friends because they\u2019re not really friends. It\u2019s really really damaging to hear your accomplishments diminished by people you\u2019ve actively supported in their goals. I have to say it must be hard to be single yes but you made an observation trying to offer advice. She hit you with a low blow. She\u2019s let her true colors show because what she said is how she truly feels about you. my advice is talk to the other friends explain the other side of the story.  if they still think you have to apologize reevaluate the friendship. Do not give your time or energy to people who do not respect your efforts and accomplishments.", "NTA. I've seen a comedy video breakdown of the standards you're describing and it's something like 3-5% of all men that end up matching them and also being single.  \n\nTry finding one in that tiny percentage that's compatible and not an arrogant raging dick.  Especially since most men (especially the ones who are rich and want kids) don't care about their partners salary or education level.", "at 30 a dude with those qualifications doesn't have to date anyone you are top of the food chain at that point why would you settle down lol", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have gone off about you getting what you want because you\u2019re pretty. \n\nAnd you shouldn\u2019t take her standards personally. They\u2019re not about you and they\u2019re not unreasonable things for her to want.", "NTA, she put the question out there and couldn't handle an honest answer. Now she's trying to turn your mutual friends against you to protect her ego. This is not a good friend. \n\nYou're also right. Men don't really care about their partner having a degree or making a lot of money. I mean if they do, cool. But we place a lot more importance on other things.", "Nta. I don't even think her standards are a problem or unreasonable. There's probably other flaws that are turning men off but only she can self reflect in what they are.", "NTA. She's single because she's objectively awful.", "NTA.\n\nAnd if she is set on her standards she is going to love a lonely life. There is nothing wrong with waiting later for a serious relationship. But most people who are in their 30s and make 6figures are already in relationships, or have had previous marriages.\n\nI miss how easy dating was in the early 2000s, and back then I can't believe that would have been considered easy.   But you actually went out, met people and talked to them. And then saw how irt went. Where now not only do a lot of people think it's inappropriate to just walk up to a woman and start a conversation. But before 2 people even share their first word, they are filtering out like 90% of the dating pool. And are looking for the perfect partner on paper before they ever meet.  Instead meeting someone you have some chemistry with, and building a good relationship.", "Esh - I feel like you missed a big opportunity to validate your friend by digging in and focusing on the wrong part of what she said (hello, just sympathize with her - she IS AMAZING, and it\u2019s CRAZY that it\u2019s so hard for her) and also, if that\u2019s how she feels about you, she should have kept it to herself.", "NTA and highly doubt this is real. I swear I've read this story before", "NTA. I think you were actually being really nice. Tell her to get her ass to the gym.", "NTA. Your friend sounds jealous\nAlso sounds like she might be pretty in an unconventional way, aka not pretty", "NTA - she sounds like she is looking for a cash machine not a life partner", "If she is truly not pretty and not someone who could attain nor simulate prettiness via money or effort, you should cut her a break. Life is hard on women who are not pretty.", "NTA \n\nJust by her stipulations for a partner, you can already tell what type of person she is.", "NTA. Maybe she is single because she is an asshole. No amount of education, money, or good looks make up for a shitty personality.", "Ugly and demanding...Its A Bold Strategy Cotton, Lets See If It Pays Off For her.", "Yeah- that\u2019s a hard one, do you have an easier one? Lol", "Why do you wonder when we all know why?\n\nOh yeah. Is that sarcasm? \ud83e\udd14", "Right? I think maybe she came up with these strict standards *after* she started catching on that she has a hard time attracting / keeping men. I suspect she prefers to pretend that she's single because she has high standards, and not because no one will have her.\n\nIt can ease the accumulated sense of rejection and give an illusion of control of the situation, when she tells herself that *she* is the one doing the rejecting, and get to complain that no one is good enough for her.\n\nThis complaining is actually preservation of her self image. That's why it felt like an attack on her person when you challenged that narrative. It's very telling that she thought her response was a proportional rebuttal.\n\nStill NTA. If you're going to tell yourself life lies to cope, keep them to yourself and don't try to force others to play along and validate them.", "100% this girl told a huge sob story to their mutual friends and didn't mention how much of a dick she was back to OP.", "That's exactly what this is. \"Friend\" is trying to lean on her education and income as the reasons she should be partnered or married, and is befuddled why it isn't working. OP took that away from her by pointing out that it's really not relevant at all, and that leaves \"friend\" in the uncomfortable position of having to face the fact that her personality is likely more to blame than anything.\n\nIn short, she wants to live in the fantasy of \"I'm doing everything right, why isn't it working?\" instead of actually trying to figure out what's wrong, because that puts all the blame on men (or women, if that's her thing)/society, and not on her.\n\nOP is NTA.", "Yeah I had a friend like this. It was exhausting having to watch what I\u2019d say when she\u2019d be venting about her life, especially when she\u2019d go off about another gf who she swore did her wrong.\n\nNot surprisingly she suddenly stopped being my friend. To this day I have no clue why, she just started making excuses whenever I tried to reach out. Not a surprise considering I\u2019ve seen her do it to other woman, and I should\u2019ve ended the friendship myself when I realized all this about her.", "Why is it always women that say that to other women?? It\u2019s despicable.\n\nFriend was being a biatch here and OP is of course NTA", "As someone who enjoys being single, that's kinda bullcrap. There's a ton of financial and logistical benefits to being in an even semi-decent relationship. You do give up a lot of freedom and independence to get those benefits, so some of it is individual values, but having someone to walk your dog or go pick up your meds when you're sick - for free and without having do a bunch of mental calculations around which friend is available and likely to say yes and what their schedule looks like - makes life a lot easier.", "Her requirements would be reasonable if she had built herself into the kind of woman men who meet those requirements actually want.  She hasn't.  That's literally what OP was trying to tell her.", "The job and a chunk of income will go away when you retire.  What about who a person is, what they like, how they spend their off time, are they funny, kind, generous?  Do they share the same values?", "Yes, people who don't want/can't have kids are like.....5% of the population, and when you add the other requirements on top of it, your options are near nonexistent. In fact, difficulty finding a partner is one of top grievances posted in r/childfree. The friend isn't wrong to have such expectorations, but she should be prepared for the consequences, ie, slim pickings.", "Yeah I will never get the whole list of criteria, is just weird. I have a friend who is in a very miserable relationship with a guy because he is from a specific country and he is blonde. She refuses to break up with him because he is from that country and those are the best men according to her mother (who has never met a dude from that place before).", "JFC she is delusional!", "Ummm. As a woman who is past having children, I beg to differ on the \u201cacceptable mate\u201d options. Unless you\u2019re talking about OP\u2019s criteria - yes, you\u2019re going to find precious few men who have no children and/or aren\u2019t divorced. But otherwise? Not that hard.", "Solid take.", "Las Vegas, Nevada.", "First date, bring your last 5 years 1040s", "Legit.

You're so peachless", "She does and I'm not, I'm just really sarcastic.", "Brilliant", "I sure do like pumpkins!", "That\u2019s a tangent from OP\u2019s question and another conversation entirely. In the case of my friend, I couldn\u2019t imagine. She thought contradicting every declarative sentence a man uttered was a form of sexy banter.", "Oh for sure, having a partner you can trust is great, but most of the time it just takes less effort being single, in my opinion. \n\nRelationships are something you gotta put effort towards and lots of patience and communication. Also a lot of self evaluation, and self work if you don't want your own baggage to unfairly affect your partner.", "The friend said she was a college graduate with a six-figure income and wanted the same in a partner, plus not married before and with no kids. She's not asking for anything she doesn't already meet herself.", "I think the OP meant \"can't have\" as in does not have kids right now, not as in physically can't have them.", "I think friend may still be dating well into her 40s based on her attitude and overly high standards. I've known plenty of people who made a six-figure income who were just happy to find a partner they loved and who treated them well. Asking for things like someone without major debts is fine, but insisting on only dating people who have a degree and fall into a certain income bracket kind of makes you elitist and also drastically reduces your possible dating pool. Would this woman seriously not date someone who owned a successful business making over six figures just because they didn't go to university?", "No it really isn\u2019t a shitty thing to say, this commenter is delusional!", "touche! Makes sense :-)", "She\u2019s just jealous. Only idiots equate education = intelligence anyway.", "Ooof, as much as she shouldn't have said that - as someone who married your high school sweetheart I wouldn't recommend commenting on her dating life at all. You've never dated as an adult and you really do not know what it is like.", "I think you're a very good friend, and she was totally wrong to blow up at you like that 100%. I will say her requirements honestly seem pretty easy. 100k salary - hundreds of thousands of new grads make that at 22 years old, pretty easy. No kids and never married by 30; fairly easy also; and college degree also pretty easy.  It seems like she's asking for the same criteria she already meets herself.", "Exactly. She wants someone bringing as much to the table as she does.", "They are a bunch of idiots honestly", "Hard no here lol", "I don't think her standards are overly high. She just has to be okay with the being single if she can't find someone who meets them.\n(Seriously. Those aren't crazy high standards.)", "Oh my God, dating in your 40's is AMAZING!  That's when women hit their sexual peak, and it is Wonderful!  Be ready.", "It is, but it also feels very fake.
