Gee, I wonder why she's single.", "**NTA**\n\nReal friendship is sometimes saying the hard things, and that's just what you did. You didn't undermine her success, her education, her looks, etc. She sure did that to you though, and it is not even close to the same thing. To say that you only have what you do only because you are pretty and artistic? Bullshit. I've known plenty of pretty and artistic girls that are still single/divorced (also in my early 30s) and don't have degrees or careers because they either are jerks or have no work ethic. Sure, being pretty can help in some situations, but it also hinders in others.  \n\nHonestly, I would think about making her into an acquaintance over a close friend. She sounds like she is determined to make her own life miserable by having such unbending standards and stipulations and will obviously lash out her insecurities in a vindictive manner.", "Definitely a justified asshole after she just reduced all your successes in life to being 'pretty'. \n\nCan't say that level of pettiness is a sought for quality in friendship or romance.\n\nNTA", "How odd that she deserves an apology for an \"insensitive\" comment but you don't deserve one when she made a comment about how you got everything because of your looks. She dismissed you(all your hard work, all your effort, all your milestones)based on your appearance. This is not a friend. NTA", " \"it\u2019s hard being single\"  \n\n\nI mean as someone who hates being single, it seems a hella lot easier than the easiest of relationships.", "NTA. I had a friend like that when I was 30. Her demands are pretty much a guarantee that she'll never find anyone who meets all these criteria. What you said to her was fair and not mean or \"insensitive\" or especially an \"asshole move.\" If this is how she reacts to hearing something other than what she wants to hear -- well, then. Good luck with all that. You certainly don't owe anyone an apology just because they are unhappy with where they positioned themselves in their life and take it out on you while falsely claiming that you started it.", "It is hard being single in your 30\u2019s feels like everyone already found someone and the ones that are single there\u2019s a good reason why. I agree with you the education thing and not being married before is a bit stupid, wanting someone with a similar level income and no kids isn\u2019t unreasonable as those things can make a relationship very different. I think NTA, she was saying to you that because you\u2019re pretty you got stuff which I think is out of order, what you said about college and salary I don\u2019t think is unreasonable.", "By the way, you will always be the AH for speaking the truth when the person you\u2019re speaking to hides behind a veil. They don\u2019t want to hear or see ANYTHING for what it really is.", "NTA. People who have a big list of requirements for a future spouse should start with the number of people in their city, take out half for being the wrong gender, take out the number who are married or not their sexual orientation, and continue reducing the number until they get to what is left. She is likely to find there are very few people in her area who meet her qualifications. Take out the ones who are left who would t marry an asshole like her, and she may find there is no one left.", "NTA, but realistically you are fighting against nature and you will not win the argument no matter how logical your points are. Many, if not most, younger successful women looking for serious relationships have a visceral, almost wired-in aversion to dating below their economic and educational level. To be clear I am talking about women looking for serious, committed, potentially marriage-oriented relationships, not one-night stands and hookups.\n\nHaving said this, she does have a point about her chances vs yours if she is not all that \"conventionally attractive\". Beauty is a HUGE advantage across the board for young women regardless of their economic and educational status, and it is intensely annoying when people who are pretty claim that being attractive has had little to nothing to do with their economic or relationship success in life.\n\nIn any event, there is nothing you can do to help her. The high-earning, college-educated, never married childless, 30-something men your 30-year-old friend seeks do not care all that much about women's educational level or earning ability. They want reasonably intelligent, attractive, pleasant women who are nice to them. Their fishing pond is 100X larger than your friends.\n\nShe is not the only one in this position. As women's earnings and educational levels have increased substantially over the past several decades, they (unlike men) will NOT easily go down the economic and educational ladder for mates *until* they age out of being able to have children, at which point their acceptable mate options narrow to a vanishing point. At that stage, their priorities often rearrange, and dating a successful, divorced plumber becomes a viable option.", "ESH I'm assuming you've been married or at least with your partner for a few years- dating in your 30s is much different than in your early 20s, so your experiences aren't exactly similar. \n\nWhile pretty privilege is a thing it was unnecessary for her to go there. So yea, you were both shitty friends that night.", "NTA, you kept it real with her and she didn\u2019t like it because she would rather believe that she is entitled to/will find a man that checks all her (largely superficial) boxes.", "NTA, but your friend does have reasonable requirements; depending on where you live, a new college grad can easily make six figures in their first job, so her expectations aren't out of line and she's only asking for criteria she meets herself. Just because education and income weren't important to you, doesn't mean she has to feel the same way. She was horrible to say you only have your success because of your looks though, that would be enough to reevaluate the friendship if she doesn't realize how wrong that was.", "NTA\n\nJudging someone \"value\" as a partner on their levels of education and income is quite shallow.", "Nta, her problem isn't HER standards, it's other people's standards of not wanting to date a total jerk.", "You both kind of suck for not speaking kindly to one another, but you're more the asshole here. If she's looking for someone who matches what she has to offer that's fine. You feeling a certain type of way about her wanting an equally successful partner and taking it out on her is the AH move here. YTA.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She refuses to date anyone that doesn\u2019t have a college degree, isn\u2019t making six figures, ...\" ... **What does SHE bring to the table?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat kind of degree does SHE have?", "Info. How pretty are you?", "NTA but she is. And she clearly wants to keep her dumb, superficial list of requirements so she can complain about how somehow she's been short shifted while people like you get it all without doing anything. Don't understand why your friends want you to apologize for not lying to her but I definitely understand why she is single.", "NTA. She's going to be single for a long time.

Maybe you were tired of listening to her complaining and finally said what was on your mind... and she retaliated in kind. And now ur in a fight. I guess the question now is how good a friend is she to you (and vice versa)- but honestly, the standards she chooses to hold her date up on is her choice. She lives with it everyday- you calling it out was you being annoyed by her since I can't imagine most ppl would just change their minds on their friends' say-so", "NTA\n\nWhen she's alone at 40 she will likely need to re-evaluate her high standards.", "NTA, no wonder she\u2019s single", "NTA, by a long shot.\n\nAlso, even if she *were* to find someone who somehow manages to meet all the criteria in the beginning, who\u2019s to say she won\u2019t immediately dump them as soon as they can\u2019t meet one of the criteria?\n\nJobs aren\u2019t always permanent, so would she dump the man who used to be making 6 figures as soon as/if he loses the job?\n\nEither way, you need to be rid of her.", "NTA and why did she need to involve other people? Absurd.", "Sounds like you have three friends to ditch.\n\nNTA", "NTA, refer her to a plastic surgeon and tell her to get back out there. Her singleness couldn\u2019t be due to her personality or victimhood or her short temper, that\u2019s for sure!", "Ladies I don't want to be so blunt...guys who have a degree...make 6 figs...don't have children...haven't been married...they date early 20s girls.   Once you 30s those standards will crush those dreams.", "[deleted]", "She is, not you.\n\nI know she's your friend, but I laugh at women like her who got more than they bargained for. She wanted the future to be female, now she's got it. Men aren't doing very well in our feminized society, and she has nothing to offer. Her college degree doesn't mean anything to a man. It's probably even a negative. It means she think she's smarter than she is. Education isn't intelligence. The 100k is nice, but she's not giving that away for free. She wants more than 100k in return! And she can probably get it. There are a lot of men with more money than brains who will just give it to her. But she's not going to have a real soul mate type relationship with a pay pig. A legitimate man who earns more than 100k is out of her league. She needs a down to earth blue collar guy who gets by with odd jobs. She provides the steady income. That's what she signed up with with her fancy degree, right? The man provides everything she can't on her own. Excitement. He can fix things around the house, make things for her, teach the kids, dwindle away her money on frivolous get rich quick schemes, I don't know. What's she going to do with $200k that she won't do with $100k? She needs someone independent with ideas that can keep them dreaming of millionaire success even if they probably won't get it.\n\nLook at birds. The Peacock has bright ridiculous colors. The peahen is drab and subdued.\n\nShe is right that physical attractiveness is massive and you're downplaying it. You probably don't want to admit to yourself that your husband and job had a lot to do with it. But you weren't saying that and were't out of line about anything. She was. She's probably right in assessing herself as ugly, but I'll bet she's also frumpy, as in she wears baggy clothes, has a non-feminine haircut thinking she can be taken seriously as an imitation man, only to be resentful when it makes things worse not better. She is not playing to her strengths. Men will fall in love with ugly women if they are not ugly on the inside too. They see her and they see divorce on the horizon. I'm surprised she didn't demand that her man must also be a feminist Democrat. Tell her to lift weights and stop eating high carb.", "Tell her she\u2019d better simmer down if she wants a 1%er. \nRecommend that she listen to Fresh and Fit podcast.\nA man wants a woman who need him for dependency; Not one that feels like she\u2019s is already at the top without him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think your friend was a huge AH for flinging accusations at you, and I also may be able to offer insight into why she has the standards she has.\n\nI'm 31F with similar standards, though I would say I have income and educational *preferences*. I would give someone a chance if I otherwise liked them and they didn't meet those preferences, but there are reasons for having those preferences based on my actual dating experiences.\n\nI have two master's degrees. I don't quite make 6 figures yet, but it's realistic for me to expect to in <2 years.\n\nIn my experience, men who don't have the same education level as I do can be very insecure about it, especially if they work a blue collar job or don't have a four-year degree. Hell, I've even had men with four-year degrees get mad at me for using words they don't understand. I agree that you don't need to have a degree to be intelligent, and I also know plenty of people with a degree who aren't very bright. However, I have also found that my experience in higher education has helped me view the world and think critically in a way that is difficult to achieve on your own. I have found I am more likely to be compatible with people who have at least a bachelor's degree. \n\nAs far as income level -- I've been in enough relationships and observed enough of my friends' to know that even when a man professes to want to be equal partners and split household labor 50/50, realistically, most of it is still going to fall on the woman in the relationship. I don't really want to have to be the breadwinner and the household manager, and so I would like a man who makes at least in the ballpark of what I make.\n\n\nAgain, these are preferences rather than absolute dealbreakers, but I also haven't found many exceptions.\n\nOP, I get the sense that you took your friend's standards personally, as though she was saying that people who don't have a certain income level or education level, such as yourself, are inherently bad partners or don't have value as people. While I can't speak for her, I don't think that's what is going on here.\n\nIf her experiences are anything like mine, she's probably gone through Hell in the dating scene. I think sometimes women who met their person early on don't realize how difficult it can be, and how many men lack emotional intelligence, basic relationship skills, and how much work it can be for women to get them to be actual partners. It's likely those standards have developed over time as protective measures and to filter out men who are looking to take advantage of her.\n\nShe's a huge AH for the accusations, but I hope you can understand that her standards aren't meant to hurt you.", "This is definitely the most realistic take on this situation. \n\nMost guys just won\u2019t care if their partner makes a lot of money if they already are educated and making significant income.

Women can do everything a man can do until she gets pregnant and gives birth.  Suddenly she has to rely on someone else.  Why would any woman with a good education and high salary want to rely on someone less reliable than herself?  It's hard-wired into all humans to find a suitable partner.\n\nThe issue now, of course, is that men are consistently disappointing our expectations and we're choosing to be single and not have children because the biological risk isn't worth the reward.", "An unmarried, child-less, 30 year old man with a college degree making six figures will probably be dating a 25 year old or younger attractive woman.", "Hmm. I\u2019m well aware that good looks can make life easier. The friend is not ugly. She is also conventionally attractive.

The conversation just kind of fell apart but it\u2019s not something a friendship should break up over. \n\nThe friend is coming from a place of hurt so it sounded like she was lashing out but she mentioned pretty privilege which is definitely a thing when finding a partner.\n\nIn the 20s, more options are available and people are more willing to invest in a partner. By the time it\u2019s 30s, standards are higher as people become more established and have firm expectations in what they\u2019re looking for. The friend who\u2019s dating actually isn\u2019t asking for much (like if you go to the Bay Area, there\u2019s much a higher ratio of single and professional men looking for their partners with those credentials - especially since both of you are freshly 30 which is still super young.)\n\nIt might help her to try a different area. Or find a matchmaker quick to help find connections of serious life partners from other areas who are seeking someone like her. Try getting her date in person or meet people in a 3rd space and not just online.", "I disagree with the salary requirement as well BUT if that is how much she is making I can understand her reasoning considering men who earn less than their wives are more likely to cheat and women who earn more than their husbands end up taking on MORE household duties than women who earn less than their husbands.", "I understand this, but my friend is attractive by society\u2019s standards.

Firstly, assuming op is us based, less than 20% of the us population makes 100k a year and this number includes households, meaning a substantial portion of this 20% arent single. Automatically ruling out 80% of the population because of income alone is crazy. Secondly, like op says, her location makes it near impossible for her to meet anyone. You could get away with demanding a potential partner makes 6 figures in cities like LA or NY. There's a lot of money flowing around the city and there are always people coming in and out. Because of this, your chances of meeting a guy who is doing well for himself are much higher. Lastly, OP's friend isn't conventionally attractive. Guys good enough to meet the friends standard are good enough to meet the standards of a lot of other women too. Because of this, these guys also have standards, and physical attractiveness tends to be quite high on the list for what men look for in a potential partner. So op's friend would have to bring something really special to the table for these types of men to choose her over all of the conventionally attractive women they could choose. \n\nCombine all of these factors and the friends dating criteria is a recipe of her being single.
