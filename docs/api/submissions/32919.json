We live in a 2 bedroom apartment. \n\nUntil recently, I had all of the kids sharing a bedroom. The girls had a bunk bed, my son had his toddler bed, and most of their stuff was kept in the playroom or hall closet. \n\nThe playroom is our second living area. It's about 9'x20' and is mostly separated from the rest of the house. It isn't a legal bedroom because it doesn't have a door or closet. \n\nThe kids needed some space so I moved the girls into the play area. We installed a sliding barn door to fix the no door issue and got them some Ikea wardrobes to fix the closet issue. They still have their bunk bed but as they get older I plan to get them their own beds and split the room with room dividers so it feels like they have their own rooms. They love having all of the extra space to play and my son is excited to have his own room. \n\nThe problem is my brother visited and saw the barn door on the kids room. He asked about it and I told him that it's the girls' new room. He's upset that I put the girls in there because apparently they'll be safer in a real bedroom with a real door and that one day they'll realize I shoved them into the living room instead of giving up the master. \n\nnow I'm wondering if I shouldn't have put them in the playroom.

I lived in a home with a \"bonus room\" which was a small room with no closet so the landlord couldn't call it a bedroom, even though that how we used it. \n\nYou came up with a very reasonable solution. You put a door in for privacy, gave the girls more space, and have appropriate furniture for them.

You're making the most of the space you're in. It has a window, you added the door for privacy and storage.  Seems like your daughters don't have an issue with the space. Children have been sharing rooms for hundreds of years. It's not always possible to have a room for each kid.  I would give them freedom to decorate their side to their own individual style.

I will say, since you have two girls and only one boy, the two girls should probably have been given the second bedroom and your son put in this extra space. Unless the extra space is a lot bigger, in which case then it makes sense to put the girls there. Whichever space is larger should be where the girls should be since there are two of them sharing that space. What you describe is something that many people do and not unusual at all.

After I moved into what would be my last bedroom in that house it was quiet for a good while, I\u2019d say 3-4 months. Then the tapping began. \n\nIt started in my closet; I suspect it actually began at the other end of the crawl space that curved around into my closet. The entrance was on its own landing at the top of my stairs, like a cutout with carpeting and all, and a little square white door with a brass knob. \n\nI thought at first rats, maybe raccoons or squirrels; it was an old house after all, we can\u2019t be sure there isn\u2019t a hidden hole in the roof. We called an exterminator but there was nothing nesting in the crawl space *or* the roof. \n\nIn fact, the people that came by said they were surprised at how well organized the crawl space was (thank you borderline OCD but already severe mother) and that the previous roofers\u2019d done a good job because there weren\u2019t any openings that they could find despite the age of the house and how much of the original architecture still stood. \n\nAnyway, the tapping increased. It was always at night, and it would start in the closet but then it would skitter behind my bed and tap almost like in Morse code. Like it was trying to play in a way. It wasn\u2019t rhythmic, not a song. It was a series of taps in mostly 2s and 3s, but I never got a sense of if there was some sort of reference that would mean it was some sort of communication. \n\nSometimes I would tap back, but I didn\u2019t like doing that much because the taps would become more insistent and loud when I did. That was when I started to suspect that the spirits in the attic might be young. They didn\u2019t have a sense of boundaries, if I tapped back that meant playtime and they were insistent on \u2018playing\u2019 until *they* were done, not me. \n\nI noticed that the more I engaged with the upstairs spirits the more bold they\u2019d get; they began playing pranks. Their favorite was waiting until around 3 am and then whisper shouting my name in my mother\u2019s voice in my ear. \n\nI\u2019d shoot up in bed thinking something terrible was happening (fire, murder, biologically enhanced centipedes roaming the streets, you get it) only to find a completely dark, quiet house and no mom calling me after I didn\u2019t respond. That\u2019s how I knew it wasn\u2019t her; if my mom called up the stairs for me and I didn\u2019t respond in time, meaning .02 seconds, she would call again. \n\nBeyond that the 3rd floor kids were fairly chill, sometimes they\u2019d move my things but they only seemingly had access to items already out. Meaning all my little tchotchkes, any hair or face products in my bathroom, pictures on my nightstand were all fair game. I didn\u2019t mind that much, but I did get a bit frustrated when they messed with pictures of my grandma after she died. I had a bit of a telling off with them in a moment of mild hysteria and they actually did lay off. I found that surprising but quite kind. \n\nTo come back to the ghost on the second floor: when I grew up and broached the subject of the house being haunted again with my mother, she finally fessed up. It revealed a lot of why the old woman didn\u2019t visit consistently.\n\nTurns out, that same spirit would visit my mother as well, but for her afternoon naps. My mom has a well documented history of 1-1:30 pm naps and that didn\u2019t change when we moved. What we figured out was most of the days I didn\u2019t get sleep paralysis were days my mom felt the presence instead during her nap. \n\nWe both agreed that while it wasn\u2019t an altogether unpleasant experience, it felt cloying and needy. Neither of us ever figured out what that spirit in particular wanted, so the new owners as of roughly 2 years ago inherited some rather otherworldly roommates. \n\nBeyond that, the only other thing I always felt in that house was an overwhelming sense of being watched as I walked down the front path. I could never tell which of the sunrooms the feeling was coming from (I mentioned in another comment that we actually had 2, one was on the ground floor and functioned as my mom\u2019s office). All I know is you can\u2019t turn your back on that house without feeling eyes on you. \n\nIt\u2019s creepy, but I loved that house. I grieved heavily when my parents sold it. It had so much personality, and it knew who it wanted to own it. Would always act up when flaky buyers came by for a viewing; weird sounds, the old intercom system would go off intermittently (it\u2019s been disconnected since the 80s), and the same tapping I used to hear as a teenager.\n\nThe family that finally clicked has four little girls and the house seems to like the whole family. I think because there are so many unfinished lives and stories amongst long dead grandparents and children, the house itself longs for youth and innocence. It wants a big family to fill its rooms with laughter and stories. \n\nThat house may have been and still is haunted as all hell, but I\u2019m glad it got another family to love and helped grow. It treated us right despite being a bit unique, and none of us ever experienced any actual physical harm in that house. What was scary in the moment I look back on as mostly miscommunication and japes. Just got a bit lost in translation.", "Apologies, I took myself to a movie date, just seeing this now. \n\nIt took until adulthood for my mother to admit that I was always right about the second floor in particular being haunted. She never wanted to admit it when I was little because she didn\u2019t want to scare me. Joke\u2019s on her, would\u2019ve been better if she told me she was experiencing the same things. I grew up for a long time thinking I was the only one. \n\nAnyway, the first \u2018incident\u2019 I suppose you could say took place in the bathroom connected to the second floor sunroom. I was maybe 8 years old, about a year after we\u2019d moved into that house.\n\nI had the bathroom door shut and latched, and I can be sure of that even now because every house I\u2019d lived in to that point was within a 3 block radius and were all built roughly within the same decade. \n\nAll the doors between the three houses I\u2019d lived in were oddly sized, original metal work and required some finagling to get them completely latched. You had to fight for that \u2018click\u2019 and I know I heard it in the bathroom door connected to the landing. Meanwhile I had the sunroom door open, but all windows in there were shut and latched. Easy to check, as they had old school cast iron turn locks at that point. \n\nI was doing kid things, messing around with my sister\u2019s things despite being told not to. I\u2019d been in the bathroom ~15 minutes just mucking about when out of nowhere the bathroom doorknob *turned* and the door slammed open to reveal an empty landing, then with just as much force the sunroom door slammed shut *and the knob latched into place*. \n\nI ran out of there before I could even fully register what happened. I was hysterically crying and screaming for my mom. When she came over and I told her what happened she tried to tell me she\u2019d just closed the window on the landing below and the air current\u2019d pushed both doors to open and shut respectively. \n\nI knew that wasn\u2019t right, because true to my kid hijinks I\u2019d made sure the door was latched so I would have forewarning if someone, notably my sister, was coming in. I may have been 8 but I wasn\u2019t stupid when it came to my doing things I wasn\u2019t allowed. \n\nAfter that I avoided that bathroom for about two weeks, preferring to do my showering upstairs in my older brother\u2019s shower (that says how scared I was) and my teeth brushing in my parent\u2019s room until I was eventually shuttled back into the second floor bathroom. \n\nNever had another experience like that in that bathroom but never felt right being alone in either room for extended periods. One of the reasons I moved to the 3rd floor when my parents offered to renovate for me. \n\nAnother was the extreme sleep paralysis I experienced in my second floor bedroom from age 7-15/16 when I finally moved upstairs. It wasn\u2019t every night, but it happened often enough that I was terrified to sleep in that room. \n\nI understand that sleep paralysis can happen to anyone, anytime and is for all intents and purposes medically related. I also believe that mine was paranormal related because since moving out of *that* room I haven\u2019t had any sleep paralysis. It\u2019s been 15 years and I can confidently say that room and the spirits/souls caught within were the cause. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t that the apparition (yes, just one) was scary in appearance per se, it was more a suffocating presence that sat on the end of my bed, often on my feet and always in the middle of the night (between midnight and 2am). The apparition was an older woman, I can\u2019t describe her clothing or her face even, I just *know* she was elderly, lonely, and benign. It wasn\u2019t that she was a figure in front of me, it was more that she invaded my dreams in a way. I only remember a kindly sort of demeanor and long salt and pepper hair, left wild mostly but sometimes it was half tied back. \n\nI suspect she or someone she loved died in that room, or both. She came to me sporadically. There were weeks that I\u2019d sleep soundly (I later found out why) and others she would come 2 or 3x a week. Some months were particularly bad, I remember winter being a significant uptick. \n\n(Continued in another comment because I am way too verbose)", "This really does seem like an \"oh boy, time to tell everyone how amazing my rich kid childhood was\" but I'm going to chalk it up to a \"they have a balcony?

Comparing wealth and how property was used from eons ago is a bit pointless. I'm just saying I know families who have 3 story homes (they rent out the top 2) and aren't anywhere close to being rich.", "I know, I said above to others that living in a home, three story or not, dos not make someone rich or even close to it. I'm saying the girl they're replying too is foolish for comparing her whole floor to sharing a room with a balcony.", "Is this where we line up for open-cricket6994 to buy us a new house with large rooms for all?", "I know folks like that too. But I'm not speculating off of people I know, only off of the information given, and considering the size, scale, location, and age of the house, I'm assuming they're again, at least upper middle class."]}
