We live in a 2 bedroom apartment. \n\nUntil recently, I had all of the kids sharing a bedroom. The girls had a bunk bed, my son had his toddler bed, and most of their stuff was kept in the playroom or hall closet. \n\nThe playroom is our second living area. It's about 9'x20' and is mostly separated from the rest of the house. It isn't a legal bedroom because it doesn't have a door or closet. \n\nThe kids needed some space so I moved the girls into the play area. We installed a sliding barn door to fix the no door issue and got them some Ikea wardrobes to fix the closet issue. They still have their bunk bed but as they get older I plan to get them their own beds and split the room with room dividers so it feels like they have their own rooms. They love having all of the extra space to play and my son is excited to have his own room. \n\nThe problem is my brother visited and saw the barn door on the kids room. He asked about it and I told him that it's the girls' new room. He's upset that I put the girls in there because apparently they'll be safer in a real bedroom with a real door and that one day they'll realize I shoved them into the living room instead of giving up the master. \n\nnow I'm wondering if I shouldn't have put them in the playroom.

I lived in a home with a \"bonus room\" which was a small room with no closet so the landlord couldn't call it a bedroom, even though that how we used it. \n\nYou came up with a very reasonable solution. You put a door in for privacy, gave the girls more space, and have appropriate furniture for them.

You're making the most of the space you're in. It has a window, you added the door for privacy and storage.  Seems like your daughters don't have an issue with the space. Children have been sharing rooms for hundreds of years. It's not always possible to have a room for each kid.  I would give them freedom to decorate their side to their own individual style.

I'm of the opinion that unless someone is helping you pay your bills, they don't get to have a say in the matter unless there's an actual safety issue. And there is not. When I was married to my first husband and our son was young, we initially had him in our bedroom and then eventually felt like he needed his own space. Off of the kitchen we had a corner area that was considered the living room. We turned that into his bedroom and he loved having his own space. I will say, since you have two girls and only one boy, the two girls should probably have been given the second bedroom and your son put in this extra space. Unless the extra space is a lot bigger, in which case then it makes sense to put the girls there. Whichever space is larger should be where the girls should be since there are two of them sharing that space. What you describe is something that many people do and not unusual at all. If your brother has an issue with it, let him step up and contribute money each month for you to be in a bigger space.
