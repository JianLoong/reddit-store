Your mother is very abusive and the fact that you would even remotely consider that you might be the AH in this situation shows how much damage she has already done to you. Cut off contact with her and her side of the family (even if only for a little bit) to get yourself out of the fog and see how truly abusive her behaviour is, and get started on therapy as soon as you can, it will be a journey.

The law requires your mother to care for you until you turn 18, and she can not charge you rent. Seems like you already know this, but your mom is a terrible parent. The most important thing for you to do right now is to get your documents from her house ASAP and get a bank account without her on it.

I recommend therapy, even if you think you're doing OK, and you should look into government programs that can help you get things like health insurance as soon as you turn 18. \n\nIf your dad's mom is willing to let you stay for some time, stay there.
