I love cooking on my free time. I work usually work late at nights and he comes home late afternoons. So during the mornings I look at recipes and try to cook/learn to make new foods, because of that I got into a habit of buying very nice and expensive Japanese kitchen knives for our kitchen. The price of my knifes ranges from $200-$5000. One day I come home and I see my $5000 knife on the kitchen counter soaked in water and looked very dirty. I immediately went and cleaned it up and put it back into its original box that it came in. This specific knife I only bought just to have and never use because it was incredibly expensive and only 200 were ever made. The next morning I asked my boyfriend how the knife ended up being used and left in such a poor condition. He said he was doing some cleaning, saw the box and got curious then opened it and because he wanted to get into cooking as well, he used the knife to prep. I didn\u2019t get upset at him because he didn\u2019t know about the knife. So I told him how much it was and how priceless it was to me. He understood and said he would never use it again. Yesterday morning I woke up and took the knife out just to see if there was any damages done. I take it out of the box and grabbed the handle and noticed it was wet, this is very unusual as the last time I cleaned it I made sure it was 100% dry and covered it in microfiber wipes for the upmost protection. I stormed into our bedroom enraged and woke my boyfriend up and asked him if he secretly used the knife again. He admitted to using it the night before and said he cleaned it very thoroughly\u2026 apparently not. I asked him why would he use it again when I specifically said not to. His excuse was it was the sharpest knife and liked using it, every other knife in the kitchen was dull which is BS because I take care of my knifes. So I told him if he even breaths near the knife again he\u2019s going to buy me a new one. He apologized and agreed. Here\u2019s why I might be the AS. When he left for work that day I hid all my kitchen knifes and went to a nearby supermarket to buy a new knife for my boyfriend since he said all mine were dull and because he doesn\u2019t know how to clean and take care of knifes I wanted him to used and learn to clean this cheap one first before using mine again. The new knife wasn\u2019t as good but sharp enough to cut food. When I came home he ask where I put all the knifes and I told him until I see that you can take care and clean this cheap knife and keep it in good condition for the next few days, until then he won\u2019t be using mine again. He got annoyed and said I was acting like a child and that the new knife doesn\u2019t cut well and needs to be sharpened . I grabbed my grit stones and said to him then get sharpening. He ignored me the whole day today.

I'm going to go against the grain a bit, though and say slight ESH. Hiding your knives was fine, and buying him a less expensive one to learn on was a great idea, but you spoke to him like he was a toddler. He screwed up, yeah, but that's not a reason to devolve into a parent-child relationship with your boyfriend. I know it feels like it is. He was acting like a child, so you treated him like a child, but that's not healthy in a relationship because it will breed resentment.

I can't speak for OP, but I sincerely doubt that she got the \"training knives\" as a means to \"save her relationship.\" It was purely to protect her knives from someone who couldn't be trusted around them. You're jumping to an awful lot of conclusions here. You're asking that she just blindly trust him despite him proving to be untrustworthy. I agree with you that these are things that can be worked out, but her protecting her property from him is understandable and justified. The trust has been broken, and it's going to take work to mend it. If a toddler was running around with a hammer and accidently hurt their sibling, would you give them the hammer back after scolding them for using it irresponsibly? Of course not. Why do drunk drivers get their licenses taken away? For the same reason.\n\nIt also seems the point of the \"training knives\" was for him to learn how to use knives in general under a safer environment where her valuable knives aren't at risk, and before whipping them out again. You're coming at this from the assumption that the good knives are never coming out again. OP never said they wouldn't, so I don't understand where you're getting this notion that she's treating him like a child without justification.", ">It was purely to protect her knives from someone who couldn't be trusted around them.\n\n\n>protecting her property from him is understandable and justified. The trust has been broken\n\n\nIf that is the case (and this is an assumption on your side) the why is he still in this apartment? How can be he trusted with anything? Yes, I assumed that she wants to continue her relationship with him despite his (undaubtedly awful) behaviour and therefore believes in his betterment and therefore allows him to be in her apartment at all. \n\n\n\n>I don't understand where you're getting this notion that she's treating him like a child without justification.\n\n\nOf course she has very good reasons. But she IS treating him like a child. He is an adult so in general she shoud talk to him and make shure he understand the problem first. (There is no other way to solve this than him realizing he was in the wrong.) Hiding stuff in your apartment is regardless of context not a recipie for a healthy relationship.\n\n\n\nI dont know why we are even discussing, when he is the one who should have to fix the situation."]}
