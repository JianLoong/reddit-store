I love cooking on my free time. I work usually work late at nights and he comes home late afternoons. So during the mornings I look at recipes and try to cook/learn to make new foods, because of that I got into a habit of buying very nice and expensive Japanese kitchen knives for our kitchen. The price of my knifes ranges from $200-$5000. One day I come home and I see my $5000 knife on the kitchen counter soaked in water and looked very dirty. I immediately went and cleaned it up and put it back into its original box that it came in. This specific knife I only bought just to have and never use because it was incredibly expensive and only 200 were ever made. The next morning I asked my boyfriend how the knife ended up being used and left in such a poor condition. He said he was doing some cleaning, saw the box and got curious then opened it and because he wanted to get into cooking as well, he used the knife to prep. I didn\u2019t get upset at him because he didn\u2019t know about the knife. So I told him how much it was and how priceless it was to me. He understood and said he would never use it again. Yesterday morning I woke up and took the knife out just to see if there was any damages done. I take it out of the box and grabbed the handle and noticed it was wet, this is very unusual as the last time I cleaned it I made sure it was 100% dry and covered it in microfiber wipes for the upmost protection. I stormed into our bedroom enraged and woke my boyfriend up and asked him if he secretly used the knife again. He admitted to using it the night before and said he cleaned it very thoroughly\u2026 apparently not. I asked him why would he use it again when I specifically said not to. His excuse was it was the sharpest knife and liked using it, every other knife in the kitchen was dull which is BS because I take care of my knifes. So I told him if he even breaths near the knife again he\u2019s going to buy me a new one. He apologized and agreed. Here\u2019s why I might be the AS. When he left for work that day I hid all my kitchen knifes and went to a nearby supermarket to buy a new knife for my boyfriend since he said all mine were dull and because he doesn\u2019t know how to clean and take care of knifes I wanted him to used and learn to clean this cheap one first before using mine again. The new knife wasn\u2019t as good but sharp enough to cut food. When I came home he ask where I put all the knifes and I told him until I see that you can take care and clean this cheap knife and keep it in good condition for the next few days, until then he won\u2019t be using mine again. He got annoyed and said I was acting like a child and that the new knife doesn\u2019t cut well and needs to be sharpened . I grabbed my grit stones and said to him then get sharpening. He ignored me the whole day today.

You're jumping to an awful lot of conclusions here. You're asking that she just blindly trust him despite him proving to be untrustworthy. I agree with you that these are things that can be worked out, but her protecting her property from him is understandable and justified. The trust has been broken, and it's going to take work to mend it.

It's a reasonable deduction based on her actions.\n\n>But she IS treating him like a child.\n\nIf he doesn't want to get treated like a child, then maybe he shouldn't act like one. She never would've hid *her* knives if he hadn't used them after he said he wouldn't. How is this connection of events eluding you?\n\n>in general she shoud talk to him and make shure he understand the problem first\n\nShe did. Twice! What more does OP need to say?\n\n>(There is no other way to solve this than him realizing he was in the wrong.)\n\nHe admitted he was in the wrong in the first discussion they had, yet he did it again. Again, what more does OP need to explain? He clearly understood, but didn't care.\n\n>Hiding stuff in your apartment is regardless of context not a recipie for a healthy relationship.\n\nDamn, I guess I'm in a toxic relationship with my wife for hiding my Christmas presents for her from her.

OP is handling this correctly.", "I think our disagreement is in the priority of long term vs shirt term solutions. You argue, that her posessions are in immeadiate danger and she therefore shoud hide them from her bf. Because his obvious incompetence/malice he can not be trusted.\n\n\nIf thats the \"main\" problem then again I don't know how she can still trust him to be in this apartment at all.\n\n\nI argue that she wants to keep this relationship. Therefore she must beleave for him to have a way to restore her trust in him. And at trust him currently that he has understood the severity of the problem. How he can regain her trust is the main problem here. Treating him like a child might be justified or excusable in this instance but it wont help him on his task. Therefore her behaviour was not constructive for this general problem. \n\n\nDoing nothing and letting him come up with a solution would have been better because now the discussion might just drift to \"you broke my knife\", \" but you treated me like a child\", \"but you...\". \n\n\nShe should keep up her boudries and I probaly would have demanded a very detailed explanation on how he got to this behaviour and how he intends to fix the broken trust until a given ultimatum. Again if he can not be trusted not to use the knifes even now there is not much use in talking and he needs to leave...\n\n\nI wrote ESH and by no way I mean that equally. He is 100% AH. And she did behave emotionally understandable but not ideal, so maybe 10% AH.", "I'm not sure what your relationship experience is, so I'm not going to comment on it. I am married though and have relationship experience prior to meeting my wife, so I'm speaking from my experiences on what's worked and what hasn't.\n\nTo me, this whole thing is a minor issue. I personally wouldn't divorce my wife over something like this. He wanted to use knives. He found knives and used them. Turns out he shouldn't have. He overstepped boundaries. She understandably got upset. Trust is something that is earned and needs to be re-earned when lost. Both of the solutions you've presented are extreme ends of the spectrum. Either she stays with him and gives him infinite chances while giving no consequences for his actions, or she gives no leeway and breaks up with him over this whole incident. Neither of what you've suggested is a good way to handle it. You're failing to see the middle ground solutions. There's no on-size-fits-all solution for all relationship problems. I'm not saying you think there is, I'm just driving a point that not all problems have binary solutions.\n\nOP did the right thing by establishing a boundary. When it was violated, she retaliated accordingly. Him, and by extension you, perceiving her getting him knives he can use and mess up as childish is an ego problem on his part. He's insinuating that he doesn't need \"training,\" while simultaneously not taking responsibility for his actions. This could be indicative of a pattern of behavior, but it's not something to break up over immediately. We don't know what their relationship is like. The only way I'd suggest full on separation is if this was a pattern of behavior. Not enough info is given to come to that conclusion, therefore your stances are all based on assumptions.\n\nETA\n\n>Doing nothing and letting him come up with a solution would have been better\n\nHis solution was to throw her boundaries aside and keep using the knives. If you believe this was the best alternative, I suggest you to try this strategy with your partner and see how it works out for you."]}
