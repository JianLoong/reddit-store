I love cooking on my free time. I work usually work late at nights and he comes home late afternoons. So during the mornings I look at recipes and try to cook/learn to make new foods, because of that I got into a habit of buying very nice and expensive Japanese kitchen knives for our kitchen. The price of my knifes ranges from $200-$5000. One day I come home and I see my $5000 knife on the kitchen counter soaked in water and looked very dirty. I immediately went and cleaned it up and put it back into its original box that it came in. This specific knife I only bought just to have and never use because it was incredibly expensive and only 200 were ever made. The next morning I asked my boyfriend how the knife ended up being used and left in such a poor condition. He said he was doing some cleaning, saw the box and got curious then opened it and because he wanted to get into cooking as well, he used the knife to prep. I didn\u2019t get upset at him because he didn\u2019t know about the knife. So I told him how much it was and how priceless it was to me. He understood and said he would never use it again. Yesterday morning I woke up and took the knife out just to see if there was any damages done. I take it out of the box and grabbed the handle and noticed it was wet, this is very unusual as the last time I cleaned it I made sure it was 100% dry and covered it in microfiber wipes for the upmost protection. I stormed into our bedroom enraged and woke my boyfriend up and asked him if he secretly used the knife again. He admitted to using it the night before and said he cleaned it very thoroughly\u2026 apparently not. I asked him why would he use it again when I specifically said not to. His excuse was it was the sharpest knife and liked using it, every other knife in the kitchen was dull which is BS because I take care of my knifes. So I told him if he even breaths near the knife again he\u2019s going to buy me a new one. He apologized and agreed. Here\u2019s why I might be the AS. When he left for work that day I hid all my kitchen knifes and went to a nearby supermarket to buy a new knife for my boyfriend since he said all mine were dull and because he doesn\u2019t know how to clean and take care of knifes I wanted him to used and learn to clean this cheap one first before using mine again. The new knife wasn\u2019t as good but sharp enough to cut food. When I came home he ask where I put all the knifes and I told him until I see that you can take care and clean this cheap knife and keep it in good condition for the next few days, until then he won\u2019t be using mine again. He got annoyed and said I was acting like a child and that the new knife doesn\u2019t cut well and needs to be sharpened . I grabbed my grit stones and said to him then get sharpening. He ignored me the whole day today.

You're jumping to an awful lot of conclusions here. You're asking that she just blindly trust him despite him proving to be untrustworthy. I agree with you that these are things that can be worked out, but her protecting her property from him is understandable and justified. The trust has been broken, and it's going to take work to mend it.
