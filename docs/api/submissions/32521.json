None of my business really,  but if you're that cash strapped, I'm dubious on her chances of success. Starting a business can be expensive.  Might be better to get a regular job without start up expenses and save up.  Or do you both really believe she has a good chance at success?\n\n(And please... this isn't an MLM is it? Asking because taking money from places you shouldn't to \"start a business\" is often where those stories start and they don't end well)", "Does your wife like your/hers daughter? Wtf. \n\nNTA. You are doing an amazing thing for your kid. Your wife wants a car for her new business? She can make a loan for it!", "NTA.  Also, as soon as you can, instill the habit of saving in your child.  In this culture of I Want It NOW, the virtues of frugality and planning for the future are very much unappreciated - but are needed more than ever.   \n\nThere are too many people who end up in their old age destitute and desperate.  There are so many cautionary tales in r/AgingParents, r/legaladvice, and similar subreddits.  Talk to your wife about financial planning with these stories at the ready.", "Lock it into a high yield bond or something, that will mature in 7 years or so. That way she can't get at it.\nTell your wife to get a job or a better job so that she can get a car. Probably the other moms are pressuring her to get a better vehicle", "YTA. \n\nYou already have a property which you are passing on to your daughter. In whichever country you are, it should be something valuable. \n\nIf your wife is requiring a car for work, you can consider it also since you feel she needs it for business. \n\nYour daughter is only 2 years old. You need to save only for her tuitions. From your house and your life insurance, she will get the head start she needs \n\nCan you provide more to her as inheritance? Yes. \nBut the amount of suffering you and your wife have to go through for that is not justifiable. Why should you struggle to put aside some money for your daughter after so many years. You can live well, earn more and leave whatever you have once you pass away. You don\u2019t owe any more to your kids.", "Your wife sounds like a horrible and selfish mother", "NTA. That is your daughter\u2019s money for her future. \nAlso, if this is your wife\u2019s business, her Startup money should not come from your daughter, or really, your \"family income\". This is how people end up throwing good money after bad. How do you know if her business is costing you money or if it is making money if she is mingling finances? She needs to come up with a viable business plan for you to discuss as an investment before any money comes out of family finances for her.", "NTA. If your wife is starting a business that requires a car that's her problem. Your inheritance is not the solution to your wife's problem. Also: it's really nice if you to save up for the future of you child. The earlier you start the better because interests compound.", "ESH. It\u2019s good that you\u2019re thinking about savings, but it seems like you have become fixated on saving for something that\u2019s 20 years away *and are not also thinking about what your current financial needs are*. \n\nThat would be out of balance - and it\u2019s generally not a good idea to do things in an imbalanced way. \n\nSounds like there might even be some trauma informing that imbalance (eg bad childhood with drunk dad + death of mother, rescued by your mum\u2019s savings). \n\nIt would be worth doing some \u201cbig picture thinking\u201d about your family finances - and then making some decisions *as a couple*!  \n\nBecause the 2nd reason you\u2019re the AH here is because you seem to be making family finance decisions on your own & don\u2019t appear to believe your wife has an equal say. That\u2019s\u2026 not how a healthy relationship works. \n\nBasic principle of adult finances is (after the basics of: get your outgoings down to less than your income) have \u201cemergency savings\u201d of minimum 3 months for all your standard outgoings. \n\nDo you have that?\n\nBecause if not, you are wrong for saving for your daughter before you have put that in place. \n\nIt\u2019s not a savings account for holidays or cars etc. \n\nIt\u2019s a security fund in case you lose your job / have a family emergency. \n\nThat\u2019s your first priority, if you have money for saving. \n\nBut also you need to think about short term spending.  If the family does need a car (it\u2019s not clear from the post if that\u2019s a real need or not) then that should be considered. There also needs to be some kind of \u201cfun money\u201d every month or life just becomes a dull, hard, slog that\u2019s barely worth living. It doesn\u2019t have to be much - but saving for future security *at the expense of living your life now* is not balanced. If you have money to put into savings then you can find a balance between that & (at least minimal) fun money. \n\n**TL;DR:  make sure you are looking at your finances with balance across the big picture**:\n\n- short term: actually living your lives now \n\n  - including monthly \u201cfun money\u201d - even if it\u2019s a tiny budget. Needs to be non-zero if you can afford to save. \n\n  - includes short term savings for things like: holidays, car repairs, birthday presents, etc. \n\n- medium term: 3-6 months\u2019 money for bills as an emergency fund\n\n- long term: daughter\u2019s future\n\nETA: I said ESH then didn\u2019t explain how I thought the wife was also an AH. Because it\u2019s fairly obvious - she doesn\u2019t seem to have good financial priorities here. And if you\u2019re not financially secure (eg the 3-6 months emergency fund) then she probably cannot afford to start a business. Most fail & just cost money & never make money. Unless she has a detailed & professional business plan (and it\u2019s not an MLM scheme) then this probably isn\u2019t the right time for her new business.", "NTA. If your wife needs a car for her business that should be factored into her business plan. It is an absolute no go to pay business expenses with private funds. Some might also find it rather unethical to steal from your own child, some don't. I think it is just as bad as or worse than stealing from other people.", "NTA, once you give it to your child, it stays your child's, its the only attitude you can have or you will take the money over and over and there will be nothing left. Your wife is starting a business, the car should be a cost of the business and come out of business funds. There are plenty of classes on learning to handle money, maybe think about attending some to get a handle on handling your money and savings.", "NTA\n\nIf your wife wants a car for her business, then SHE can work and save up for one.", "NTA you are doing a good thing. I'm 43 and just started saving this year because no one ever taught me how important it was. If my parents had paid my tuition or a down payment on a house, I would be leaps from where I am now (nearly everyone who had this help in life is further ahead that those of us who didn't). Stick to your guns and don't let her steam roll you.", "ESH because you are not communicating about financial goals and it is super bad for your marriage. You and your wife have different financial priorities. You want to save for your child\u2019s future while she is worried about the present. You tell us there is not much money to go around, so I am betting this 5000 dollar savings is something you both feel in your everyday lives. Your wife does not share your feelings on whether it is important for a family to have a car (tbh I find it difficult to believe your lives would not be improved by access to a car, but I don\u2019t know where you live.) The truth is that whether you need a car or not and whether now is the right time to save for your daughter or not doesn\u2019t matter nearly so much as the fact that you and your wife are supposed to be partners and you are clearly not on the same page. You also seem to have a huge amount of anxiety about the future because of your history that is probably going to keep getting in the way until you deal with it. Talk to your wife, approach your budget together and find a way to split the difference between caring for your family today and providing for your daughter\u2019s future.", "NTA. Your child's savings account is not your piggy bank. If I had to choose between letting my kid go hungry or taking from their savings account I'd obviously take from the account after exhausting all the other options like going to food bank and soup kitchens. \n\n\nI don't know how smart it is for your wife to start a business when you are so strapped for cash. She may have to look at a W2 Job and start her business in spare time. \n\n\n\nAnd I hope you have her investments saved in something like VTI or similar so that it can grow with her. Investing just $25/month plus the 5k you already have will grow to 15k when she is 18 if you have it invested. And if you can do 50/month that's over 23k! And I hope your wife doesn't have access to that account. And stop sharing with her what you are contributing for your daughter as she seems to lack basic personal financial skills and only thinks about now vs long term", "Thank you, I was just thinking about this. If his wife was able to make money using the car, their family would benefit financially. You also need an emergency fund for unexpected emergency expenses whether medical or job related. If a car increases your cash flow, it will be much easier to save. Also if it\u2019s a business, it can be expensed and their other tax incentives. This should be a conversation and not so one sided.", "Usually small businesses and the owner are one in the same because it\u2019s most likely set up as a sole proprietor. You need cash and resources to start a business and I would definitely want to use my personal cash instead of these interest rates. Also most banks want projections and collateral. If you don\u2019t have it, your options become less and interest rate increases because you\u2019re probably a more risky loan. You would need to find a small business not profit type to help with this. It\u2019s a lot of work but they can be very helpful. Main point is you usually do use personal funds to start a small business."]}
