It\u2019s good that you\u2019re thinking about savings, but it seems like you have become fixated on saving for something that\u2019s 20 years away *and are not also thinking about what your current financial needs are*. \n\nThat would be out of balance - and it\u2019s generally not a good idea to do things in an imbalanced way. \n\nSounds like there might even be some trauma informing that imbalance (eg bad childhood with drunk dad + death of mother, rescued by your mum\u2019s savings). \n\nIt would be worth doing some \u201cbig picture thinking\u201d about your family finances - and then making some decisions *as a couple*!  \n\nBecause the 2nd reason you\u2019re the AH here is because you seem to be making family finance decisions on your own & don\u2019t appear to believe your wife has an equal say. That\u2019s\u2026 not how a healthy relationship works. \n\nBasic principle of adult finances is (after the basics of: get your outgoings down to less than your income) have \u201cemergency savings\u201d of minimum 3 months for all your standard outgoings. \n\nDo you have that?\n\nBecause if not, you are wrong for saving for your daughter before you have put that in place. \n\nIt\u2019s not a savings account for holidays or cars etc. \n\nIt\u2019s a security fund in case you lose your job / have a family emergency. \n\nThat\u2019s your first priority, if you have money for saving. \n\nBut also you need to think about short term spending.  If the family does need a car (it\u2019s not clear from the post if that\u2019s a real need or not) then that should be considered. There also needs to be some kind of \u201cfun money\u201d every month or life just becomes a dull, hard, slog that\u2019s barely worth living. It doesn\u2019t have to be much - but saving for future security *at the expense of living your life now* is not balanced. If you have money to put into savings then you can find a balance between that & (at least minimal) fun money. \n\n**TL;DR:  make sure you are looking at your finances with balance across the big picture**:\n\n- short term: actually living your lives now \n\n  - including monthly \u201cfun money\u201d - even if it\u2019s a tiny budget.

Because it\u2019s fairly obvious - she doesn\u2019t seem to have good financial priorities here. And if you\u2019re not financially secure (eg the 3-6 months emergency fund) then she probably cannot afford to start a business. Most fail & just cost money & never make money.

If your wife needs a car for her business that should be factored into her business plan. It is an absolute no go to pay business expenses with private funds.

You and your wife have different financial priorities. You want to save for your child\u2019s future while she is worried about the present. You tell us there is not much money to go around, so I am betting this 5000 dollar savings is something you both feel in your everyday lives. Your wife does not share your feelings on whether it is important for a family to have a car (tbh I find it difficult to believe your lives would not be improved by access to a car, but I don\u2019t know where you live.) The truth is that whether you need a car or not and whether now is the right time to save for your daughter or not doesn\u2019t matter nearly so much as the fact that you and your wife are supposed to be partners and you are clearly not on the same page. You also seem to have a huge amount of anxiety about the future because of your history that is probably going to keep getting in the way until you deal with it.

If you don\u2019t have it, your options become less and interest rate increases because you\u2019re probably a more risky loan.

Get on the same page with a budget. It sounds like your wife is also trying to increase income, which would allow you to save more, but if not having a car hurts that, you could be running dangerously close to financial abuse territory if your wife doesn't have a steady income and is not being given consideration in the finances for you as a couple. Not giving a designation because there's a lot of nuances that could swing it either way, but since most are pointing out one side, I'm just gonna point out half a couple not being given a say in finances who doesn't have a source of transportation and is being hindered from getting one to run a business is a red flag in a lot of situations\n\nEdit: because I pointed out in a different comment I'll add it on here for the \"get a job\" crowd- not having a car can also hinder wife's opportunities to do that, depending on where they live.

You sound lovely and I'm glad you're saving, but generally I agree with your wife that saving for your own needs should come before saving money solely for your child's future use. Building an emergency fund for yourselves, enhancing your own professional qualifications (to increase your future earnings), starting a business (if it's a good business idea with a good chance of working), buying a home (to build equity), and saving for your own retirement (your child can borrow money for college/a house, but you can't borrow money to fund your retirement), are all things that should come before saving your child a nest egg. A car is also a reasonable expense to spend family money on, depending on the situation (you didn't give details so no judgement there).\n\nYour mom was in a somewhat unusual situation and I would guess she saved a nest egg for you because your father was spending family money on alcohol. So maybe she felt that taking some of the extra income and saving it for you, would be better than it being spent on alcohol. She probably didn't feel your father would \"have your back\" later in life because of his addiction. But hopefully neither you nor your wife is an alcoholic. Assuming you and your wife are both fairly reasonable people, the two of you are your child's most valuable asset for his/her future. Your own careers should probably be your biggest investment at this stage of life, when presumably (given you have a 2 year old child) you have the ability and potential to work hard and earn more income.\n\nYou say you're not good with money but clearly you have good instincts as you want to save.

It's funny how you can't form an opinion all of a sudden.", "Actually that applies to all custodial accounts, as well as 529s and retirement accounts. Future money being worth less than current money is a dumb reason to spend it all and a reason you don't store it in a sock under a mattress and why government created investment vehicles for that money where you can invest it in low cost ETFs or index funds such as sp500", "But it's not actually needed here.  It's wanted.  So many confuse need with want, and that is why so many have bad finances.  She wants to start a business.  She doesn't need to start a business.", "Financial planners are in the business of selling you investments.  They will never tell this couple they should invest in their business instead of investing in the market or whatever they suggest that they make a commission off", "Maybe, but since one of the two adult members of the family *does* think they need a car, it\u2019s hard for me to rule out the possibility that a car would make things easier for them.", "Maybe. Even with a lot of those jobs, if OP and their family don't need a car for every day life, I don't see how their spouse would need a car to start a business.\n\nI'm not saying that in some places a vehicle wouldn't be the norm for these jobs but in a most places having a vehicle is the norm. They don't have a vehicle for their day to day life to begin with.", "Like I said, suspected. No matter what, I question how stable her plan is. All new small businesses come with a certain amount of risk and given her stance on personal savings, she doesn't sound like someone who would have a good business plan that includes solid risk mitigation.", "Because they don't have a car. OP is in the UK, I think, because he referred to his mother as mum. And for all we complain about it here, if you live in even the most modest of towns there is public transport that is usable enough that some people don't need a car. Some big cities it's even a disadvantage to have one.", "They think $5k is a lot of money, they don't have a car, only one parent works - they're definitely not middle class.", "I gave advice I didn\u2019t tell them to purchase a car. All I said was have an emergency fund. If a car helps increase cash flow, get it. Never did I assume it would. These are choices they have to make based on their knowledge of the situation and what they can handle/able to do. I\u2019m not sure what you read.", "It depends on the financial advisor. I'd recommend going through a free one through his workplace or the library. They don't have those same business motivations.", "Per ops post history they seem to live in Copenhagen which according to a quick Google is [a model for how to design walkable cities](https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/five-cities-show-future-walkability/1066681/)\n\nI agree they should have a regular family savings before having one for their kid, and a good term life insurance policy might be a good option to explore\n\nBut if they're still in Copenhagen I doubt public transport in day to day life is that much of a headache tho I'm open to being wrong. If this is a purely business necessity then I think this will really depend on what the business is, predicted ROI, etc, and should be reframed as \"wife wants to invest x amount in her business, is that a sound financial decision and where would the money come from\"", "Middle class doesn't step down directly into abject poverty. Working class people are not inherently living in poverty. Also, *I'm* comfortably middle class as a single professional and *I* think $5k is a lot of money. Because - ya'know - **it is.**", "$5,000 *is* a lot of money, whether you grew up poor or not.\n\nAnd OP has said they don't *need* a car *unless* his wife starts whatever this business is, so buying one doesn't make sense when they actually can afford not to have one. And if the business is an MLM, they can't afford for her to start that business.", "Okay, I also think $5k is a lot of money and I'm not living at \"poverty levels\". We have retirement savings, have a paid off car. We also save every month, and have savings for our 16 month old to go to college in 16+ years. And I repeat, I still think $5,000 is a lot of money.\n\nJust to note, you don't really \"need\" a car in every city (in the US), and even less in every country.", "Cash flow needs to exceed expenses of the car. Depending on where you live car insurance can be expensive, they might need to pay to park it if they are in a city, repair costs, etc.", "How do you give advice when you can't form an opinion? It makes no sense to me how you can cherry pick and twist yourself to explain stupidity.", "You are correct", "I don\u2019t follow you. You can give guidance. Have you heard of self help books? they give guidance and advice but they don\u2019t make decisions for you."]}
