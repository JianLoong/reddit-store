This is a massive adjustment and at your age it is one that could be extraordinarily difficult. If your dad has room it makes sense.", "NTA Your mom is being selfish. Her job as your mom is to prioritize you not herself. She got remarried, good for her. She moved in 4 other people in a house that is not big enough for 6 people and expect you to live with it. Before getting married, your mom should have considered the living space, since its not big enough she should have looked for a bigger space for all 6 of you and then you all move there instead of taking away half your room.\n\nSince your dad has space, why wouldn't you move there? Tell your mom, you will live with your dad until she has space for you. You'll visit when you can.", "NTA. Do not let her guilt you into staying there. She is making it all about HER. Have you told her everything you just put on here about your stuff going missing and so forth? Tell her you\u2019ll work out a schedule where you can come over but this isn\u2019t what you had in mind.", "NTA.  Tell her you will visit her, but this is not working for you", "NTA - you can be happy for her without having your own life completely disrupted.", "NTA. Sounds like your mom is trying to turn this around on you and she's the one being selfish. You can be happy for her and still not want to be in a crowded house without privacy. As long as you are happy to live with your father then I say continue to do so without guilt. It's possible that she is angry because she is making this out like you are choosing Dad over her but either way NTA Dad's your parent too and I bet he's really happy to have your company and a 15 year old girl deserves some privacy if she can get it. Good luck at Dad's house OP.", "NTA. You\u2019re old enough to make that choice for yourself. You have to choose what will make you the most happy and comfortable.", "She should understand your feelings and not make you feel guilty. It would be difficult to be living with a bunch of people. Hopefully she would keep everything fair between you and all your siblings. I hear so many story\u2019s where the step parent doesn\u2019t care about their step kid and literally does everything for just their kids..", "NTA. It's a massive change in your life and it sounds like your mother is dismissing your concerns. You can still visit but you need to put your own  needs first and move out.", "NTA. There's no a priori reason for you to live with either your mom or your dad. Your mom's house doesn't have much space any more, which makes your dad's place a better environment for you now.", "NTA\n\nA dad is a parent too", "NTA.   You can be happy for her from your Dad's house.   Your mom needs to understand that her actions affect the entire family,  not just her.", "NTA. I just HATE it when my stuff keeps disappearing. Did you even tell your mom that that was happening? If you do and she gaslights you, there's your answer that things would never work out.", "NTA\n\nYou weren't consulted in giving up your room, it just happened. So not only did you lose your personal, private space, your stepsibling is helping themselves to your stuff. \n\nMove in with your dad and get your sanity back. Your mom deserves to be happy again, but not at your expense.", "NTA.  You can be happy for her and still not want to live in an overcrowded house when you have other options.", "NtA.. he's your dad, not a stranger. THEIR divorce has NOTHING to do with YOU! remind your mother of that!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m making an assumption but it sounds like you may be an only child? Blending a family is difficult and if you are an only child, I would imagine that would be a little be of a challenge going from no other kids in the home to 3 being added.\n\nMoving in with your dad doesn\u2019t mean you are rejecting your mom and her new spouse/step kids. You are doing what is best for yourself. \n\nGood luck and glad you have your dad to live with.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m always baffled when parents do this sort of thing to their kids. As if blending families weren\u2019t hard enough, let\u2019s make them share rooms too. \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude44\n\nYour mom is the AH here thinking only of herself.", "NTA- I think it\u2019s very unfair for any child to not have a room of their own, obviously this isn\u2019t possible in some cases. But people need their own space and privacy especially as you\u2019re growing up and becoming your own human. You\u2019ve lived a certain way of life and it\u2019s become overwhelming and it\u2019s not fair on you. They\u2019ve lived with you for 2 months, that\u2019s giving it a fair shot.

Live where you feel at home, welcome and safe, period.", "You\u2019re entirely entitled to make it about you. You\u2019re a kid.

NTA.", "NTA GO MOVE IN WITH DAD DO IT. And don't bring anything valuable with you if you choose to visit your mom.", "NTA. Your mom is expecting a lot from you!  Did she discuss having stepdad and kids moving in and how you felt about it?  Did she ask if you wanted to share a room?  Has she sat down with you alone since the transition to see how you are coping and how she can assist you in adjusting?\n\nIf you feel more comfortable with you dad and feel like it\u2019s the best decision for you right now then that is okay.  He is your parent too and you shouldn\u2019t be made to feel guilty for moving there ft.\n\nYou mom needs a reality check!!", "NTA!  JFC, that's six people in a three-bedroom house with ***one*** bathroom. Just the noise level alone would drive me away.  Mom laying a guilt trip on you is totally unfair.  Maybe she wants to have all those extra kids, which is fine, but it's not fine to sign OP up for it.", "You are mature enough to choose. Living in a place you suffer isn't a great choice, you can be there without living them, Dad is a parent aswell.", "NTA, enough said.", "NAH. 2 months is enough time to figure out if a living situation\u2019s good", "NTA, you went from your own space to not having any space.  I'm guessing dad's house has more room.  You can be happy for her and not want to live there.", "Your mum is aware you can do both, isn't she? You can be happy she's happy, but wanting to live with your dad. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You went from having your own room to having to share a room and never having any privacy. Your mom has a right to be happy. So do you.", "NTA \n\nYou mum can\u2019t force you to be happy living as a blended family. You\u2019re technically old enough to decide where you want to live so it\u2019s up to you. Just make sure it\u2019s the right decision for you and what you want first.", "NTA move in with your dad. That is a ridiculous amount of people living in one house. Your mom is just mad her Brady bunch image she wanted didn\u2019t work ou.", "NTA your mother totally disrupted your life. They should have thought through the accommodations more thoroughly. That is too many people in a blended family with one bathroom", "NTA.\n\nYou, presumably had your own room growing up, and there were only 2 people sharing one bathroom. Your mom decides to marry and he and his 3 children move into your home, and you're now forced to share your personal space with someone you don't know very well. And your mom didn't think that's a massive ask for a teenaged girl? \n\nYour mom either wasn't thinking at all, or she was only thinking of herself. \n\nSounds like you came up with the best solution possible. Moving all your stuff out of your old room, and staying with your dad, seems optimal.", "Sounds like all the planning that should go into a creating a large, blended, family didn't happen. That's on the parents. OP is NTA for the parents lack of planning and discussion.", "NTA. Sounds like your house was invaded. 4 extra people is a lot. Living with your Dad if you have a good relationship seems logical if there is more room. Your Mom is telling you to suck it up to be 1 big happy family but the tris the house is too small for 6-7 people.", "NTA.\n\nTo your mom\u2019s two main points, it appears she\u2019s given you plenty to complain about; and you did give it a try, from which you concluded the best recourse of action was to live with your dad.", "NTA kiddo.", "NTA\n\nThis is just a part of the economics of life.  She does something that creates a problem, you do something that finds the solution.\n\nIt doesn't sound like they gave any thought to you whatsoever in this process.", "NTA, you\u2019ve got a good reason to move", "NTA. I grew up in a 3 bedroom 1 bath house with three sisters and my mom. The only time I was ever alone was in the bathroom, and I had to hurry! I would go to school looking like crap because my older sisters would hog the bathroom every morning. \n\nI love (most of) them, but if someone had offered me my own room and bathroom like literally ANYWHERE back then, I would have taken it. Fam be damned.", "Info: Do you dislike/ angry at the fact that your mother remarried and brought in a new family without fully considering your comfort and standard of living?", "NTA. Just reinforced the fact that you love her and your step family, this is only for practical reasons, that you know that she will miss having you around all the time but you will still come and visit at weekends. Plus, it might be good to spend a bit more time with your dad, to know him better and having somewhere more quite to do your homework.", "NAH. Mom deserves to be happy, and if Stepdad and kids make her happy, more power to her. You deserve to be happy too. If living with your Dad instead of in a full house where you have to compete for bathroom privileges and never have privacy and someone takes your stuff makes you happy, more power to you. I'd pick Dad over the house you describe anytime, and I think most people would too. It doesnt sound like the kind of situation you get used to, just resigned to. You can be happy for Mom and still prefer to live somewhere with a bit of privacy. Good luck to you all.", "NAH - Transition is tough, be it you have to learn to share your space you used to have all to yourself, or your mom getting used to not living with you on a daily basis.\n\nWhat does Dad think?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I want what I want and I won't put a child through that BS, it's not fair for them.\n\nAnd especially when *expanding* a household. Bringing together two families *requires* space expansion.
