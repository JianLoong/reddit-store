I'd pick Dad over the house you describe anytime, and I think most people would too. It doesnt sound like the kind of situation you get used to, just resigned to.

Your Mom isn\u2019t putting you first before her new husband and his kids.", "NTA. This is a major, major, major shift in living circumstances and your mother is gaslighting you about them. Living with all those people and their noise is not for everyone, and you're lucky that your dad's living arrangements have room for you.", "NTA it is about you, though. You get to live happy and comfortably and just because she's got a good situation now, doesn't mean it fits you.", "Yea you keep finding things to complain about because there's something to complain about in every room", "NTA.  You\u2019re a child - you\u2019re supposed to make it about you.  So is she got that matter.", "THIS \u201cyour mom deserves to be happy again, BUT NOT AT YOUR EXPENSE\u201d thank you for saying it!!!", "Don't forget the child support that mom is going to have to pay now", "I\u2019d agree with this usually but housing is absolutely insane where I live in the US so they get a pass just aren\u2019t allowed to complain when OP does the obvious.
