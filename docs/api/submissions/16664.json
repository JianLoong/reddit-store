Them getting married is not a surprise.\n2. They are being respectful by not making brother's event about them\n3.

They did it alone, quietly, barely took pictures, insist on not saying anything until after the honeymoon, and acknowledged that they don\u2019t want to upstage the other couple.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how you see anything wrong here. What is this really about lol.", "YTA.  I think your sister and now SIL went out of their way to make sure that their wedding didn't in any way take the focus off of your brother's upcoming wedding.  As you said, you accidentally found out.  When they do announce it after your brother returns from his honeymoon, DON'T say anything about thinking they should have waited.  There will only be drama if YOU create it  Butt out.", "YTA. They've gone out of their way not to inconvenience anyone & not to upstage anyone. That's their obligation, as loving and considerate family to your brother, and they're fulfilling it. \n\nIf they want to get privately married, that's their own business. And as a loving and considerate family member, you should support their desire to pursue their own happiness at their own pace in a way that doesn't actually harm anyone.", "I don\u2019t see a problem here. Why does it bother you they got married before and not after? It makes no difference to anyone besides them since no one else will even know until after the honeymoon.\n\nYou seem to think your brother will be upset, but will he? Does he react dramatically to things like that?\n\nYTA if you try to make your sister feel like she did the wrong thing.", "YTA.\n\nThey had the kind of wedding they wanted. They chose the best time for them. \n\nWhy does it matter that it was before someone else\u2019s wedding?", "YTA.  The only feathers ruffled here are yours.", "YTA \n\nIt doesn\u2019t impact your brother in any way and they\u2019ve been completely respectful", "Why should they wait? They did a legal transaction to secure their partnership,  and asked for ZERO fanfare in the doing. \n\nYTA.  Keep your comments to yourself,  celebrate your siblings ' happiness and go on your way.", "YTA. it's not your decision when they decide to get married. they kept it a secret, - are keeping it a secret. you accidentally found out. they are planning on telling everyone after your brothers back from his honeymoon. so how on earth is that upstaging. you're being very unreasonable", "YTA and obviously have no real problems if this is what you concerned about. Weirdo behavior", "Yta, people don\u2019t have to get married on anyone else\u2019s timeline.  Your brothers wedding doesn\u2019t take precedence over people living their lives.  They did it quietly and aren\u2019t making a big deal about it so as to not take away from brothers wedding anyway.  You weren\u2019t suppose to find out this soon anyway, so what\u2019s your issue here?", "YTA. Sounds like they did everything they could to make sure they don\u2019t upstage your brother while still having the wedding they wanted. Then they trusted you with that secret and you judged them.", "YTA.\nThey're not announcing it so they don't intrude or take away from the brother and his bride.

We chose our wedding date and shortly after one of my husband's family members decided to get married the day before us. Miracle of all miracles, we still enjoyed our wedding, and his family was still happy for us. I do not understand this type of thinking at all. I think it is appropriate to not announce it at his wedding, but it would even be fine to let everyone know beforehand.", "Yta so pretty much no one knows, they aren't announcing it until after, and you found out by *accident*.\n\nSTOP CREATING DRAMA.", "YTA \n\nUnless they announce it *prior to* or *at* brother\u2019s wedding, it is **not** them upstaging anyone. \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019re projecting. Don\u2019t be an AH, just leave them alone and let them enjoy being married. They aren\u2019t hurting anyone. \n\nIf your family love them, then when they do announce it, everyone will be happy for them. Well, everyone *except you* because in your mind they\u2019re doing it out of spite to upstage brother/SIL.", "YTA There is absolutely zero reason for them to have waited, especially if they\u2019re not even telling anyone until after your brother\u2019s wedding.", "YTA\n\nThere is no issue here other than you creating drama out of a non-issue.", "I N F O: how is them deciding to get married and then waiting for a period of time after your brother\u2019s wedding to announce it going to affect anyone at all?\n\nThey wanted to get married. They did it with no fuss, no ceremony. They don\u2019t want to upstage your brother so they\u2019re waiting a respectable amount of time to announce it to everyone else.

They had a quiet, discreet wedding and are only telling everyone well after the fact. There was no reason to wait a month.", "YTA\n\nAre you one of those drama loving people that can\u2019t seem to handle drama free life? They haven\u2019t done anything wrong and are being completely mature and respectful of your brother\u2019s big day. Stop trying to find drama where there is none.", "YTA. I never understand why it's expected to postpone your happiness, arrangements etc. for other people's arrangements so that you don't outshine them. They wanted to get married and they did, congratulations to them. It's not like they planned this big wedding or reveal with the intention of outshining your brother's day. In fact everything points to the opposite of it. It's a nice gesture of them to want to keep it a secret because of your brother's upcoming marriage (they are planning on waiting until after the honeymoon which is extra considerate) but even if they didn't they wouldn't be assholes to me.", "NAH but if you plan to blow their cover and put them on blast telling everyone they got married then you would be YTA. \n\nLet them have their secret chill no frills marriage, they are intentionally NOT trying to steal any of the spotlight from your brother and were not interested in having the same type of wedding/celebration as he clearly wants to have w/all the planning pomp and circumstance. This doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s that deep at all", "Why would it have been any different if they did it two weeks after the wedding? \nHonestly NAH. You\u2019re all entitled to your opinions. Quite honestly I fail to see why this should cause any drama.", "NAH. You are probably projecting too much. I still don't get how you can be married so fast (Europe requires tons of paperworks) but it is up to them.\n\n\nAnd your brother and his soon to be wife may not even care that much.", "It is a weird thing to do tbf.

People wanna make engagement announcements? Sure. Baby announcements? Go right ahead. Come out as LGBTQ? Heck yeah! Once your wedding is over the world continues turning and lives move on. Your sister went above and beyond to make sure they didn\u2019t \u201cupstage\u201d your brother. Why is a \u201cmonth\u201d such a good amount of time to wait? It\u2019s very arbitrary and everyone has different opinions on that.
