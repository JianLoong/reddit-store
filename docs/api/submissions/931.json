My dad is overall a pretty good dad but we definitely have a complicated relationship. There has been a lot of selfishness on his part when it comes to how he prioritizes his wants and desires over the relationship he has with his kids.\n\nHe remarried about 5 years ago and was dating this woman for maybe 3 or so years before that.  At first, this woman, G, was nice enough. She tried to take an interest in our lives and was respectful of times when we said we just wanted to be with our dad.  However, we noticed that she was really rude or cold to our youngest sibling (T) who has a disability.  G would either speak really harshly to T or yell at them or try to parent them (she did it to all of us but was really hard on T in a way she was not with me or my other sibling).  One of her own children has a disability and she has infinite patience for her own child, but is straight up mean to T.  Over the course of the relationship, she became increasingly mean and icy to T.  We would point it out to our dad and he would usually acknowledge it but nothing would change.  When he told us they were planning to get married, my middle sibling and I warned him that if G continued to treat T this way, it will seriously impact our relationship with him because he continues to allow it.  They married anyway and G's attitude to T become even worse, she would even make up lies to get T in trouble.  dad continued to let it slide.\n\nThe other weekend, we were all out to dinner and we ran into a few of my friends from middle school. I introduced them to everyone and introduced G as my dad's wife.  She and my dad both interrupted me to say \"step mom\", I shook my head, insisted \"dad's wife\" but continued on in talking.  My dad pulled me aside after we got home to say that I really hurt G's feelings because I won't call her my stepmom.  I reminded him of all of her shitty behavior and reactions to his kids and told him that that certainly fits the bill of evil stepmother from fairy tales but that I don't even want to pretend we have the familial relationship. She is ***his*** wife, not ***my*** anything.   He is continuing to insist that I am being unreasonable and a jerk for this, so reddit, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Some clarity!  My mom is fantastic and is and has always been a huge support to me and my siblings.  Her husband is also great and treats me and my siblings really well.  My mom has defended us and T and advocated for us as much as she can to my dad.  We lived primarily with her and would see our dad on the weekends and for a few full weeks throughout the year.  G and her children moved in when both me and middle sister were in college. T would only go every other weekend at that point and if there were times he refused, my mom would never force him to go.\n\nNone of us live at home, and we don't stay the night at dad's house anymore.  But all of us try to maintain a relationship with our dad and so we see them frequently enough.

A marriage certificate doesn't erase someone's bio mom when you marry their bio dad.\n\nYou were an adult when she married your father.

Your dad's wife had none of those, so to refer to her as your father's partner is not inaccurate. \n\nBut you've also been clear with your father that you want a particular relationship with her and they should respect that.", "\"G, can we talk? Dad says you were upset the other day when I introduced you as his wife and not my stepmom. I'll be honest, I was a bit frustrated too that you thought it was appropriate to attempt to correct me in public... It's not. And if we had a stepmom-stepdaughter relationship, I'm sure you'd know that. If you are interested in starting the process of repairing your relationship with me, I'm happy to discuss it. But until then, you are just the woman my father happens to be married to.\"\n\nNTA. \n\nAnd this part is not judgment, just advice: I find that it is easier to avoid non-productive conversations when you establish a clear pathway that the other person can use to move forward. In your case, G's starting point would be an apology to T, an attempt to make up for her past bad behavior and immediately starting to treat T differently. Then anytime she or your father brings this up in the future, you can say, \"G knows what she can do to start the ball rolling. Since she has made the choice not to do that, she's clearly not interested.\"\n\nAnd occasionally (*very* occasionally) people surprise you and actually take steps to improve themselves", "NTA\n\nYou were an adult when they married. even if you weren't, I don't think you should be forced to call her that. but to suddenly start calling her that when you don't have a mother/daughter type relationship is weird.", "NTA\n\nBut your father is absolutely the asshole for being with a woman who would treat any of his children poorly. Your father's wife is emotionally abusive and your father is complicit in the abuse  because he knows it is happening and refuses to do anything about it.

They embarrassed THEMSELVES by trying to correct your verbiage in front of your friends.

Remind your selfish dad of this.", "\"She is his wife, not my anything.\"\n\nThere you go. NTA and SHAME ON YOUR FATHER for allowing the kind of abuse especially on his youngest. I wouldn't do much to maintain a relationship with him at all if it meant having to suffer G's presence.", "NTA. My wife is in kind of the same situation, her dads wife is the \u201cother woman\u201d who split up her parents so my wife has refused to call her \u201cstep mom\u201d", "OP, I want to share my experience as I have nothing but positive things to say about my mums husband but it doesn\u2019t make him stepdad. \n\nMy Mum remarried after my Dad died.
