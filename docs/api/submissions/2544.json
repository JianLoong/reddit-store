You are using the door as a shield because you could have left them alone when asked, but left the door open on a crack or something if you were really that concerned about the door. Instead you refused to leave and stared, probably threateningly or angrily at the grieving friend. If you don\u2019t trust him to this extent then leave him. You knew what was up with the friend. You heard her sobbing uncontrollably. He told you about what\u2019s going on with her dog and calls her every day about said dog.

That is more than him \"being her friend supporting her\". He could have done that in the living room and you could have been involved in that support.

OP wasn't leaving any space for the friend to cry and let it out, so they went in a more private place so OP wouldn't be disturbing them. I don't see anything wrong with that. The husband was trying to be a good and supportive friend.", "Ugh your attitude is one of the worst in the world. Men and women can be close friends without wanting to bang. \nStop preaching misogynistic, sexist bs.", ">Supporting a friend, consoling them, doesn't require privacy or intimacy.\n\nIt kinda does, no one wants to ball their eyes out in front of people that aren't close friends or family. It's embarrassing for a lot of people to cry like that. And close friends are intimate all the time, not snogging or banging intimate but hugging while crying, sure. Plenty of friends do that. I've done that with a friend many times.", "or maybe the wife has a history of being unpleasant to her or female friends of husband.", "This is how I feel.", "OP coming in with the alt \ud83d\ude02", "[deleted]", "Clearly the beat friend doesnt feel comfortable to be vulnerable around OP, and based on this post I dont Wonder why that is.", "The wife was at home AND she clearly heard the friend crying, what do you think was happening exactly?", "Care to elaborate?", "Agreed. But his radio silence doesn't speak well for his maturity level. That's no way to communicate with a spouse, even one like OP who reacted so poorly. While I would have found the whole situation strange, I would have waited to discuss it with him after the guest left.", "Not to hug opposite members in secret.  If it is innocent why do it secretly?  Why can't he leave the door open to say \"look I am hugging my friend but I want my wife to know it is just a hug\"", "It is absolutely a generalization.    There are always exceptions.    In my many decades, I have seen numerous guy/girl friendships and in almost every one of them, the guy is playing the long game, waiting for the girl to have romantic feelings.   \n\nIt's not toxic.   It's just the truth.   I am a man.   I will never claim to know how women think(even though I was raised by 3 and live with 6), but I do know how men think. \n\nMost men are weak in this respect, so the default position is this.\n\nEdit:. This mainly pertains to single people, even when only 1 is single.", "Makes you wonder why the husband's best friend is not well known or comfortable with his wife.       If this is the case, I would call it another red flag.   Who gets the flag(wife or hubby) is in question.\n\nAll of my good friends know my wife incredibly well and are very comfortable around her(some have even cried).", "There could \"maybe\" be a lot of things. People rarely post every relevant detail in these posts.\n\nMy point is that being a friend, consoling someone, doesn't require privacy or intimacy. And yes, holding the woman in the guest room with the door closed so she can weep in his arms as he holds her IS an intimate act.\n\nThe husband was calling the woman every day consoling her, being a friend. He demolished that friend boundary when he took her into the guest room for privacy as he \"consoled her\" in his arms.", "Yep.

Jealousy sucks", "You are always taking the situation back to yourself. OP is not you. \n\nA spouse doesn't have to be friends with all of their partner's friend. People are allowed to have their own close friends. Also... it's not like it was a normal casual conversation. The friend was having an emotional issue and needed to be very vulnerable for a moment. I don't blame the friend for not wanting a lot of people seing her in that state.", "When you totally miss the joke - hence the \ud83d\ude02 at the end. \nHave a cookie friend. It's not that serious.
