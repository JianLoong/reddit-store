He got up and started repeatedly telling me to get out. I told him it's my house and he can't tell me where I can and cannot stay. He got angry and told me to get out and we'll talk later but I refused. He asked what was wrong with me for not seeing how tense the situation was and for not giving them privacy. I told him that they did need to shut the door for any reason nomatter what it was. We argued and she ended up leaving. He blew up at me afterwards calling me unbelievable and saying I had no respect for him and his friend who's going thtough a hard time and refusing to give them privacy. I told him how weird it was for them to shut the door just becsuse they were crying.

You are using the door as a shield because you could have left them alone when asked, but left the door open on a crack or something if you were really that concerned about the door. Instead you refused to leave and stared, probably threateningly or angrily at the grieving friend. If you don\u2019t trust him to this extent then leave him. You knew what was up with the friend. You heard her sobbing uncontrollably. He told you about what\u2019s going on with her dog and calls her every day about said dog. Door or no door, why did you go in and disrupt them when it\u2019s clear nothing untoward was happening in the first place.

That is more than him \"being her friend supporting her\". He could have done that in the living room and you could have been involved in that support.

I mean I suppose it makes sense (it's still harmful and weird, but at least umm logistically possible??) if you're a cishet person surrounding yourself with cishet people, from any other standpoint it makes zero logistical sense even. I should have zero friends outside my marriage according to this logic. \n3) men being socialized to not show emotions, to not be tender outside of romantic relationships is what harms all genders and is part of toxic masculinity. \n4) I understand that you felt uncomfortable. I'm genuinely sorry. Try to examine why. Do you not trust your husband? Do you not trust him around HER? If so, what are you two going to do about it? Do you want the friend to start treating you with more respect? Try talking to him. But the moment you chose to put your foot down was very wrong.

There's no reason for him to be shut away in a bedroom with his friend.", "I agree. It is okay for the husband to comfort the woman. Not okay to go into a closed room. That looks suspect.", "I think this seems really reasonable to me, fwiw.  I think her husband's reaction makes it all feel a lot worse.  I once came home to find my bf at the time and his female friend watching a movie, and her legs were across his lap.  I felt weird with how uncomfortable that made me, but I brought it up to him later and he immediately was like \"oh okay! that makes sense, sorry!\" and they stopped being that level of affectionate.  Different people are okay with different levels of touch/cuddling, but I think her husband digging in after she said something makes this all feel weirder.", "I think you\u2019re correct.

Her husband and the friend are out of line.", "Agreed. Weird as hell.", "No downvote here!  I agree with you.  My husband has female friends and I wouldn't mind if he was there for them during a hard time, but something about this situation feels off to me.  Why did they need privacy?

I would not appreciate my husband going into a bedroom and closing the door for privacy with any woman that isn't his family.  I would react exactly as she did and I've been married for 34 years.

You are taught to be careful about the appearance of the situation, because the appearance of the situation is what can cause all kinds of problems in the workplace.  Talking alone with someone while walking the garden is very different from talking alone with someone while in a closed office space with no windows to the rest of the building.

Offering someone a space of safety and comfort? Damn.", "Yep, I noticed the same thing about the door. OP didn\u2019t ask to leave the door open a crack or anything of the sort.

A parent I could understand, but a dog?) and she then shouted at her husband when he said he was not comfortable in his own house having his wife hugging (and crying? Over SOMEONE else\u2019s dog?!?) another man and telling her husband to leave.. would OP reaction be to shout at him if she had nothing to hide???\n\nIm sorry to say this OP but you need to look at how they communicate with one another in text/email/ social media.. if he has nothing to hide he will show you (even him holding his phone and scrolling quickly, that would reassure me that he is not sexting) after his over reaction.

I\u2019m afraid to admit this for being jumped on and accused of bias, but similar experience to u/Lipstick_On. I had not one but two boyfriends with a female best friends that I was dumped for. I desperately wanted to keep my fears and insecurity in check and be \u201ccool\u201d and mature, but looking back I see a lot of red flags that I think were valid reasons for me to be suspicious. \n\nSecond bf was \u201chelping best friend through a hard time\u201d which turned into him staying nights over at her place and shooting his shot with her. We broke up, but years later (after his bestie rebuffed his advances and their relationship practically dissolved into nothingness) well I stupidly got back together with and even married him. Then, a few years into our marriage he breaks down that he misses his best friend and he enlists my help to track her down and put them back in touch. I did, and then they started talking. Very soon after that my then-husband admitted to being in love with bestie and that he was willing to leave me for her, but first he was waiting for bestie to break that news to her own fianc\u00e9. Bestie ended up staying with fianc\u00e9 and cutting ties with my then-husband, leaving him a distraught mess that I then had to help him through. Only after bestie cut him off was my ex willing to try marriage counseling, and I did agree to go and of course did all the therapists' homework... but I was beyond done, the relationship was beyond saving for me. As you've surmised if you read this far, we are divorced now lol. \n\nSorry for the novel but all this to point out two things. \n\nEdit for accidentally posting before my comment was done\n\n1) As some others have already said, I doubt this is the first time there's been closed doors, insistence on privacy, etc. and my hunch is that OP's gut was telling her something was wrong for a reason. In my case, there were signs that I actively talked myself out of for fear of coming across as immature and jealous. \n\n2) for those people arguing that \"OP's husband is obviously not going to start having sex with his best friend with his wife in the house!\" Maybe not, but in my own experience at least, partners who cheat and/or have relationships with inappropriate levels of intimacy don't even hide some of their iffy stuff because they've convinced themselves it's totally appropriate, not cheating, etc. For example my ex-husband was open about the fact that he stayed the night at this other girl's house while we were together (though initially was not open about wanting and trying to be in a relationship with her). He was very open, almost boastful, about the fact that he folders on his computer with literally hundreds of photos of bestie (but like, two photos of me or us together)... but was weirdly protective of his digital privacy and hated for me to ever even incidentally glance over at his computer or phone. When he told me he was in love with her and wanted to leave me for her, he also admitted that he wasn't going to break up our marriage unless she was for sure going to break up her engagement--I mean he straight up told me I was his second choice but he was keeping me around in case his first choice didn't pan out! And he never admitted in marriage counseling how fucked up this was. \n\nSo basically, partners who are acting shady can still have incidences of alleged transparency, and it's not because they're not doing anything sus--it could be because they've just rationalized all of their behavior and convinced themselves it's not hurtful or wrong.", "The people calling OP TA are the same people who end up on the relationship sub talking about \"I feel so blindsided, I can't believe he cheated on me! I thought our relationship was perfect because he's the perfect man. I know he yelled at me that one time because he needed some alone time in the bedroom with his best friend, but I didn't think anything of it. How was I supposed to know he was having an affair???\"", "NTA Married over 20 years here, you have to be respectful of marital boundaries. There is such a thing as emotional cheating and by his actions I'd bet it might have gone farther. Him yelling at his wife and trying to make it seem like she was crazy for questioning him, was suspect. This other woman needs to find a single friend for her emotional support, especially when she isn't friends with the wife. You don't go to a couples house and request alone time in a bedroom with the husband with the door closed. This isn't appropriate. Husband sounds a little too invested in this situation and his subsequent reaction was way off. Wife's comfort level with a situation always comes first. The husbands behavior is going to lead to trouble if it hasn't already, he is completely out of line.", ">These asshole votes are from children. \n\nWelcome to AITA.

If husband had been hugging female friend in the living room or even and office or den with the door shut, wife probably wouldn\u2019t have been as bothered - but for any number of reasons, it is uncommon for a straight male (or even many masculine gay males) to be alone in a bedroom with a female \u2014 not the least of which is the potential to be accused of sexual misconduct. \n\nMy 20 year old son coaches a high school girls sport and I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have told him never to shut the office door, no matter how sensitive a concern a player needs to discuss with him. Obviously a coach/player situation is different than two adults with no potentially abusive power dynamic - but I think the risks of being in a closed room with a member of the opposite sex is drilled into boys because of potential allegations against them and girls because of potential risks to them. That is likely influencing how this adult interaction is perceived - whether that is right or not.\n\nAnd it becomes a bit of the chicken and the egg scenario, while it might not be right to advise people based on a common cis, straight power dynamic - failure to do so can create very real trouble \u2014 so the cycle and the biases continue.\n\nIf people are aware of those perceptions and biases, which they obviously are, it creates a situation where people create suspicion when they fit into one of the buckets of people you described and they deviate from normative behavior for that pairing.", "I think that was what tipped it for me. Whether the friend was a man or a woman, the fact they changed rooms, to a bedroom and closed the door feels very odd. Why not just close the sitting room door?

Like if I was comforting my best friend and she'd wanted privacy, I wouldn't be immediately going off on one to my partner for coming in.

It just shows a massive lack of trust and insecurity. Me and my partner are gay, wouldn't think twice about him hugging someone behind closed doors, male or female. Even if it was an ex, cause I'd know he'd never ever cheat.\n\nEven more so if I could hear sobbing from behind the door. I don't understand what level of distrust you must have to assume your partner and their friend would go from full on sobbing to fucking, and what level of distrust you must have to think they'd fuck in the house, while OP is still inside the house, when they know there's a good chance OP would see they aren't where they originally are and maybe look to see where they'd gone, incase they were expecting her to join.\n\nIt would be no problem if she knocked & walked in, checked if friend was okay and asked if they wanted drinks, especially as post sob headaches are usually pretty unbearable, but to stand and watch and refuse to leave is just unbelievable. \n\nAnd all the NTA responses? I honestly wonder sometimes what sort of fresh hell straight people consider stable and healthy relationships.

And...I've seen a situation like this with a friend (it didn't end well).  This person is someone who regularly crosses marital boundaries and husband lets it happen. Then she demands privacy in a closed bedroom (another apparent and reasonable boundary) ..that's a huge red flag on both ends.  It's not about 'you can't support friends or can't embrace your friend'. It's the matter in which this was done. Do we even know the dog has cancer? Like it really sounds like this could potentially be something else.", "It's strange that they had to close the guest room door to comfort them.

Basically the whole \"she stomps boundaries, says she knows my husband better than me, and compares us\" thing. Like if she had previously been super wonderful and respectful and they were like \"hey I'm pretty rough right now, can I have a private moment with my friend?\" it'd be pretty alright. But clearly she's already uncomfortable with this friend's behavior.\n\nThis is coming from someone with a similar background. My ex had a female friend, who said and did all those things, and it turned out she was sending him nudes (but it didn't \"mean anything\" and I forgave him like an idiot and it came back to bite me in the form of emotional abuse from him later, long story). There just seems like there's real disrespect underlying this.\n\nOn the flip side, I have many male friends so I've also been on the other side of this. After my break up, one of my male best friends let me stay at his and his girlfriend's house for like two weeks to get away.

They weren't just in the room embracing. \n\nThe way the op acted is a red flag to me. She refused to leave the room and then argued. THEN She said it was her house and she could go anywhere she wanted. It reminds me of abusive/controlling behavior I've experienced in the past. \n\nCould the husband be a nefarious cheater. Absolutely. But the context of the situation says the friend just needed a few minutes of private grief.", "Its odd if they're 14 and op is their mom.

I think I would be LESS uncomfortable with my husband going to the friend\u2019s house to comfort her and visit the dog (since if he is also crying and the reason is true, then he must have grown attached to the dog as well), because that makes sense. The scenario OP has described seems co-dependent to a level where I would also feel hurt and excluded regardless of whether the friend is of the opposite sex or not. Of course that would have to be a pattern more than just this particular, very sad scenario, but I don\u2019t blame OP for not being comfortable having someone\u2019s boundaries taken priority over hers in her own home.", "While I'm not sure I'd automatically be suspicious, I'd certainly feel its a bit wierd.

With the OP being clearly rather nosy, again, I'm not surprised. \n\nEverything with members of opposite sex has to be done publicly? Excuse me, what are you smoking? Are people not allowed to have doctors of opposite sex? How about seeing their family members? Are they allowed to hug them behind closed doors or is there a chaperone required?

BF already crosses boundaries and husband is right there doing the same. If I was comforting a female friend and she was uncomfortable with my husband, I would ask him to give us a minute and he could leave and go anywhere else in the house. Why would I relocate to a bedroom and close the door? Why didn't the husband say anything to his wife about taking her inside the guest room? She had to find that out on her own.

It could be either. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my husband for over 15 years and we have never been a couple to go away and close the door - if one of us wants space, whether alone or with friends, the other wouldn\u2019t hesitate so to us going into another room and shutting the door would be out of the ordinary and seem really odd.\n\nIf my husband were the type to never give me any space and I felt this were the only way to get it, that would be a different matter (but then why go to their house at all, you\u2019d surely want to be out of the way of her if she were that awful).\n\nIt\u2019s just odd *to me* but it might not be odd to others - depends on the dynamic.", "I was looking for this. \n\nHonestly? \n\nI think friend had a miscarriage and hubby is the father. \n\n(Completely reaching and unfounded)", "It's absolutely insane how I experienced damn near the EXACT same thing as you with my ex, just without the marriage. \n\nI used to be the same way where I wanted to be that calm, cool & collected partner & never wanted to come off as jealous when it came to my partner having opposite-sex friends. Annnnd of course, it landed me in the same exact situation as you. \n\nMy lesson learned from relationships is if you're too lenient when it comes to them having opposite-sex friends, 9 times out of 10 they're going to take advantage of that kindness &  cheat away. \n\nI'm so sorry you were put through hell from that d-bag, so glad you're far away from that toxicity.", "Oof, I\u2019m so sorry you got burned not once, but twice.

He and I even slow danced at their wedding while she happily rested her feet and took some cute photos of us with his mom. They invited me to their home right after I had a catastrophic breakup and they definitely both hugged me while I cried at points, but he and I would never do that with a door closed if she was there, that just wouldn't feel appropriate to either of us.

Some people are very private with their emotions; most people don\u2019t end up as close with their partner\u2019s friends as their partner is.

Had an ex who NEVER invited me to his friends parties (always a big bash for them).\n\nYeah, because his *other* girlfriend was there and so were all her friends.", "Yeahhhh.  I (female) have a married male best friend.   His wife?  Became my second best friend!  Sure,  I won the glorious friend lottery.  If your partner's best friends aren't also your friends,  though,  I'd be asking myself why.   Friends don't drive wedges between couples.", "The second I stopped being invited into the voice chats with my ex fiancee and her friends on discord, it's like a subconscious part of me... just knew.   She had been cheating on me for I think a year before she finally came clean and dumped me.", "I had a boyfriend who would never talk about his best friend with pronouns. I finally told him I knew it was a woman. He said I had nothing to worry about because they had been best friends for 20 years and even lived together and nothing happened. We took a trip together, and as soon as we got back she told him she loved him and wanted to try. He dumped me, got with her, they dated for a few months, and then got dumped. What a waste.", "Awy, you\u2019ve got a keeper \ud83d\udc96", "I have been married 3 times, to my current and forever husband for 41 years. I am his 3rd wife also. I am telling you for a fact that your boyfriend is a keeper. Wishing you both all the best. Hugs from a great grandma", "In an update OP says she didn't want him to invite the friend over. He invited her anyway and probably was worried about OP being mad. Which she was anyways so it's like. Pick your battles dude.", "I absolutely dislikemy friends partner and if I was having an emotional crisis I would 100% not be wanting him to be in the room if I went to her house for consolation.\n\nBut also despite the fact I think he's a bag of dicks I think he would have the ability to judge that like yeah, he'll leave us the livingroom therefore no one would need to be led off into bedrooms for any reason \ud83d\ude02", "This happened to me too. Knew my friend since diapers. Pretty much never see him because his girlfriends are always uncomfortable with my existence. I didnt hang with him at that point much anymore cause we went separate directions, and honestly i think partly cause girls couldnt quantify my existence in his life. We never have had a thing nor wanted to have a thing. I'm ace anyways. We were always raised like siblings and viewed eachother as such. His mom is one of my moms best friends and they lived across the street so I was over their house as much as I was at my own. I consider myself an aunt to his kids. It's sad but I'm not mad at the situation because at the end of the day I don't want to affect his relationships. I still see his kid once and a while. I see the rest of his family more than I do him these days. (Still live across from them and see his son on occasion when grandma is babysitting).", "100% agree.\n\nI trust my husband completely. But he would also never do this. It trampled too many natural relationship boundaries.", "Finally this is the comment I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t seen! This here!", "The fact that OP states her husband and the friend were crying makes me think they have a shared loss. I'm pretty certain hubby doesn't have a meaningful relationship with the \"dog\".", "Everyone has their own lines. For me, it\u2019s fine! I trust my husband completely and one of the things I love about him is that he has tons of female friends. He just treats them like normal people, and it\u2019s depressing how rare that\u2019s been in my dating history. I would have no issue at all. In fact, before we got married (but we\u2019re very serious), he hung out with a female friend I\u2019d never met but they\u2019d known each other for years. She told him to leave me and kissed him. He immediately pushed her away, got in an Uber, blocked her number, and called me to apologize (apologize for what?? Getting assaulted??). \n\nThat said, that\u2019s OUR established boundaries. It\u2019s perfectly fine to feel uncomfortable! Especially because it sounds like that woman is undermining their relationship- constantly comparing her to OP?? Pushing boundaries?? The husband stinks here, too, for not respecting his wife and insults being hurled at her.", "Totally agree here.  Being alone in a bedroom with the door shut with someone where there is already a contentious relationship due to potential possessive issues (not on the OP's part) is sketchy on the facts alone.  Add in the response from the husband, and this a clear indication of the OP's standing regarding his friend and his wife.  The \"friend\" has demonstrated she can piss on the OP'S proverbial tree, and the husband will not only allow his wife to be treated poorly, but covertly encourage it.", "Absolutely, this! This is the most important part. \n\nI agree with everyone saying the situation is suspicious but why is the husband choosing to defend the friend's emotions over his wife's emotions?\n\nThe consideration of his partner's feelings should come first so I would hope to see empathy for the fact that she was needing reassurance. It is completely understandable given the circumstances. Since the friend and OP do not get along, he should have been conscious of this before closing the door. \nInstead of trying to bridge the gap between them, he's made things worse.\n\nCommunication and respect are foremost in a relationship. The silent treatment only communicates disrespect to me, unless he just needs some time to process and get his thoughts together for a more involved conversation.\n\nEdit: typo", "Tbh if im only comfortable w one person and need to talk, i prefer to do that in a private room and have my breakdown. Not where the one im not comfortable with is available to see/pretend to care.", "Fair.\n\n\nI didn\u2019t consider that. But you are right. I overlooked over that part (the \u201cshe does not like me\u201d part), but I shouldn\u2019t have", "\u201cAnd here\u2019s the fridge to hold your Iranian yogurt\u201d", "Yep, as a woman this happened to, who also has plenty of male friends, I try to always show that I value and respect my friends partners and their relationships. If that means pulling back on certain levels of emotional intimacy until I know it's fine, that's okay. I have a good friend I used to spend nights watching tv with. I haven't since his relationship but I have had movie nights a few times with the two of them and it's always a good time.", "That's not the same behavior in the example though. Your boyfriend wasn't giving a lap dance and you don't even explicitly say he's getting one, but let's assume he is. The correct turnabout would be you going to a male strip club with a friend's daughter and getting her a lap dance and one yourself. I don't know if that would change anything for him compared to you giving a lap dance but those are two very different situations, with you taking a much more passive role in the one I outlined vs the active role in the one you described.", "This happened to me. There was always a reason for me not to go to ex-husband's work dinners or things (mainly bc I was taking care of our young child) and it was because they all knew about his cheating and maybe baby.", ">You are never friends of your partner friends !\n\nOnly if your partner has shitty friends. I'm friends with almost all my spouse's friends and when someone in the group was exposed as a cheater, they got cut from the group because we aren't cool with that", "What's crazy is this has happened to TWO people in my life. How do people get off lying like that??", "Do you have a link?", ">I will be selecting if not actually buying her birthday, XMAS, anniversary gifts on his behalf anyway so I need to know her well enough to pick great gifts for her.\n\nokay but holy invisible labor batman this is the kind of shit where these men need to step up and take responsibility for figuring out gifts for their OWN significant others???", "The real MVP right here ^^^", "ALL OF THIS SO MUCH!!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Same same. A couple of my best friends are guys and I adopt their girlfriends as new best friends and usually keep them even after they\u2019ve broken up with my bro. This is uncomfortable for my guy friends.\n\nBut better that than weirdness when they\u2019re dating. I refuse to be seen as an enemy or obstacle when I have less than no interest in what is in their pants.", "I was with you on all but the selecting gifts on his behalf that seems controlling", "You are a great friend!\n\nOP NTA, I wonder why he didn\u2019t marry her", "Don\u2019t forget the oscillating fan blowing all the marinara flags around", "That\u2019s so wonderful! I\u2019m so happy for her! It sounds like her ex got what he deserved too. Love a happy ending!", "i dunno.  i had a husband i wasnt invited to his open mic nights (youd have to get a sitter) turns out it was bc he acted single at them", "I hear you.  Ultimately what tends to\nhappen is I remind dude of a significant date coming up. He then asks me to go shopping for his girlfriend or wife. I\u2019ll get her gifts and he\u2019ll reimburse me.\n\nI never insist on doing this.  They never demand that I do it either.  It just tends to happen more often than not.", "I mean, I thought we were meant to communicate that way, but it seems like many people don't. Communication is so important.\n\nAlso, I love your Louise avatar. So cute.", "Oh I get that then. In that case I\u2019d say he needs to man grow up you\u2019re not his Mama", "You could put your foot down and not do it. I'd be devastated if I found out my partner had pawned off something so personal. These guys need to step up.", "I've been guilty in the past of not communicating properly but I can learn from my mistakes.  I know that I can't control anything but my own actions and reactions. It's a lot harder at times to keep your mouth shut than it is to give a flippant or even a hateful response, which is kind of sad. How can we hope for a better world if people choose to be so unkind to one another? All I can do is work on myself. \n\nThanks on the compliment to my Louise! You are the first person to say anything about it. Bob's Burgers is one of my favorite shows!", "My husband tries SO HARD with gifts. I know he does. And sometimes what he picks is amazing! Sometimes his gifts can be a bit...perplexing. Of course I always love any present he gives me, but he finds gift giving REALLY stressful so when he's not sure if something's going to be a hit or miss he just asks our best girlfriends and if they say \"miss\" he just gets whatever they tell him to. It works haha."]}
