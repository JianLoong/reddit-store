Makes me feel really good. \"Don't touch the dancers!\"\nYta", "Wow. How dare he?? How dare he comfort his Best friend?? How dare he tell you to get out of a room, so his Best friend would feel more comfortable crying without an audience??\n\nJesus lady.\n\nYour insecurity is YOU issue.\n\nYTA", "NTA Ok I am going to get so down voted for this.. but I honestly don\u2019t know if I would feel comfortable with my husband in a room holding an other woman that isn\u2019t family. I find this strange and disrespectful. I get men and woman can be friends but there is a thing of being too friendly. Don\u2019t get me wrong I am not a jealous person but the fact they where hiding in a room from her just kind of puts off alarm bells in my head. But I don\u2019t know the whole situation but like I said it sounds strange to me.\n\n\n\nI am editing this because I am getting so many comments. Some good and some bad. And I truly appreciate all of them. \n\nSo let\u2019s say that instead of this being a bf(take the cheating aspect out) let\u2019s say this was op\u2019s mil(husbands mom). Let\u2019s say they got really bad news from the vet and the family dog is very sick. Mil shows up and is completely distraught. So op\u2019s hubby asked her to go get her a glass of water. Op does and come back from the kitchen and they are no longer in the living room. So op goes to the guest room to where the door is shut and she hears crying. She walks in and find them embracing. Op\u2019s husband goes off just like in the post.  In this situation I still would not be ok with what op\u2019s husband did. I would still find it very disrespectful. I would still think that op and mil overstepped major boundaries.\n\n\nAnother edit. To be crystal clear i would have a problem with this situation if the bf was male or female.\n\n\nOk adding another edit because someone comment on this post and made a very valid point\nIf op is jealous and in secure of the bf. She has probably made her concerns known to her husband and the bf probably also knows her concerns about thier relationship. Instead of discussing boundaries she is comfortable with and making sure to let her know they understand her concerns they instead push boundaries even farther. The husband even yells at op and gets defensive. \n\nIf it was me and my spouse(the person I am suppose to love) is uncomfortable with a situation I would do everything in my power to let her know that her/him feelings matter to me. That she/he is my first and only priority. My marriage is my first and main priority. Op\u2019s husband and bf do not do this. Instead the husband lets the bf overstep boundaries. Let\u2019s her compare the two. He should be the one shutting down the bf. And explaining to her his wife\u2019s feelings are more important than the bfs. Why do something to make the wife even more insecure or even more suspicious.\n\n\nAnother edit because I don\u2019t know how else to fix the above mistakes. I will admit 100 percent I should not have used the mil in the above scenario.  I honestly was trying to figure out how to take the cheating aspect out of the situation and wanted to replace the bff with someone the husband could absolutely have not been cheating with. I wanted to show everyone it wasn\u2019t about cheating for me. It was about the disrespect for op\u2019s feelings toward the situation. I also had the problem with the fact how the husband yelled and got defensive. For me I had issues with the whole situation. I really hope this helps everyone understand the comment about the mil. I see now I truly failed making my point by using mil in the context for this situation. I", "NTA. He's having an affair with her.", "INFO: have you ever had suspicions on them before?

I think its possible that you had an overreaction. For now, YTA.\n\nEdit: yes the dog didnt die, but she still got a sad diagnosis. For everyone thats hell bent on cheating, it is possible for opposite gendered people to be friends. I asked for info because its unclear if suspicion is warrented or not.", "Yeah, no.

It\u2019s fine to ask him to leave the door open, tho it seems  to me the friend was grieving and embarrassed about it which might be why they went to the guest room in the first place. You stood there staring at him trying to comfort a distraught friend instead of leaving when you realized what was happening. You are using the door as a shield because you could have left them alone when asked, but left the door open on a crack or something if you were really that concerned about the door. Instead you refused to leave and stared, probably threateningly or angrily at the grieving friend. If you don\u2019t trust him to this extent then leave him. You knew what was up with the friend. You heard her sobbing uncontrollably. He told you about what\u2019s going on with her dog and calls her every day about said dog. Door or no door, why did you go in and disrupt them when it\u2019s clear nothing untoward was happening in the first place. Would you have reacted this way if he was comforting a male best friend?\n\nEditing to add YOU DID TREAT HER POORLY! She came for comfort and was met with aggression.

Either your suspicions are true and you managed to catch them in the (very unsexy) act, or you forced your way in to watch this woman cry to make sure they aren't hugging too romantically.

I should have zero friends outside my marriage according to this logic. \n3) men being socialized to not show emotions, to not be tender outside of romantic relationships is what harms all genders and is part of toxic masculinity. \n4) I understand that you felt uncomfortable.

Hence why they were there. \n\nBut really the decision to embrace someone in a private bedroom? Hell, most spouses would be more comfortable with being asked to leave the house so the person is comfortable in the living room. Normal people would just walk into another room and give them privacy in the living room.

I felt weird with how uncomfortable that made me, but I brought it up to him later and he immediately was like \"oh okay! that makes sense, sorry!\" and they stopped being that level of affectionate.

If I had a friend who was losing their dog (as evidenced by cancer diagnosis + deep sobbing) I would hug them as they cried and probably also cry myself. There's nothing sus or sexual about feeling empathy. \n\nLike I personally think NAH here - OP is entitled to her feelings, but friend is entitled to her grief and husband is entitled to offer friend privacy in the house he shares with OP. Plus, friend inviting husband over to her home to cry would be even more sus than an unlocked door in a shared home while OP is there.", "Some people feel empathy when people they care about are in pain.", "Maybe he is empathetic?

OP, you weren't there to help your husband's friend. You were there to what, supervise?

I desperately wanted to keep my fears and insecurity in check and be \u201ccool\u201d and mature, but looking back I see a lot of red flags that I think were valid reasons for me to be suspicious. \n\nSecond bf was \u201chelping best friend through a hard time\u201d which turned into him staying nights over at her place and shooting his shot with her. We broke up, but years later (after his bestie rebuffed his advances and their relationship practically dissolved into nothingness) well I stupidly got back together with and even married him. Then, a few years into our marriage he breaks down that he misses his best friend and he enlists my help to track her down and put them back in touch. I did, and then they started talking. Very soon after that my then-husband admitted to being in love with bestie and that he was willing to leave me for her, but first he was waiting for bestie to break that news to her own fianc\u00e9. Bestie ended up staying with fianc\u00e9 and cutting ties with my then-husband, leaving him a distraught mess that I then had to help him through. Only after bestie cut him off was my ex willing to try marriage counseling, and I did agree to go and of course did all the therapists' homework... but I was beyond done, the relationship was beyond saving for me. As you've surmised if you read this far, we are divorced now lol. \n\nSorry for the novel but all this to point out two things. \n\nEdit for accidentally posting before my comment was done\n\n1) As some others have already said, I doubt this is the first time there's been closed doors, insistence on privacy, etc. and my hunch is that OP's gut was telling her something was wrong for a reason. In my case, there were signs that I actively talked myself out of for fear of coming across as immature and jealous. \n\n2) for those people arguing that \"OP's husband is obviously not going to start having sex with his best friend with his wife in the house!\" Maybe not, but in my own experience at least, partners who cheat and/or have relationships with inappropriate levels of intimacy don't even hide some of their iffy stuff because they've convinced themselves it's totally appropriate, not cheating, etc. For example my ex-husband was open about the fact that he stayed the night at this other girl's house while we were together (though initially was not open about wanting and trying to be in a relationship with her). He was very open, almost boastful, about the fact that he folders on his computer with literally hundreds of photos of bestie (but like, two photos of me or us together)... but was weirdly protective of his digital privacy and hated for me to ever even incidentally glance over at his computer or phone. When he told me he was in love with her and wanted to leave me for her, he also admitted that he wasn't going to break up our marriage unless she was for sure going to break up her engagement--I mean he straight up told me I was his second choice but he was keeping me around in case his first choice didn't pan out! And he never admitted in marriage counseling how fucked up this was. \n\nSo basically, partners who are acting shady can still have incidences of alleged transparency, and it's not because they're not doing anything sus--it could be because they've just rationalized all of their behavior and convinced themselves it's not hurtful or wrong.", "The people calling OP TA are the same people who end up on the relationship sub talking about \"I feel so blindsided, I can't believe he cheated on me! I thought our relationship was perfect because he's the perfect man. I know he yelled at me that one time because he needed some alone time in the bedroom with his best friend, but I didn't think anything of it. How was I supposed to know he was having an affair???\"", "NTA Married over 20 years here, you have to be respectful of marital boundaries. There is such a thing as emotional cheating and by his actions I'd bet it might have gone farther. Him yelling at his wife and trying to make it seem like she was crazy for questioning him, was suspect. This other woman needs to find a single friend for her emotional support, especially when she isn't friends with the wife. You don't go to a couples house and request alone time in a bedroom with the husband with the door closed. This isn't appropriate. Husband sounds a little too invested in this situation and his subsequent reaction was way off. Wife's comfort level with a situation always comes first.

If husband had been hugging female friend in the living room or even and office or den with the door shut, wife probably wouldn\u2019t have been as bothered - but for any number of reasons, it is uncommon for a straight male (or even many masculine gay males) to be alone in a bedroom with a female \u2014 not the least of which is the potential to be accused of sexual misconduct. \n\nMy 20 year old son coaches a high school girls sport and I can\u2019t tell you how many times I have told him never to shut the office door, no matter how sensitive a concern a player needs to discuss with him. Obviously a coach/player situation is different than two adults with no potentially abusive power dynamic - but I think the risks of being in a closed room with a member of the opposite sex is drilled into boys because of potential allegations against them and girls because of potential risks to them. That is likely influencing how this adult interaction is perceived - whether that is right or not.\n\nAnd it becomes a bit of the chicken and the egg scenario, while it might not be right to advise people based on a common cis, straight power dynamic - failure to do so can create very real trouble \u2014 so the cycle and the biases continue.\n\nIf people are aware of those perceptions and biases, which they obviously are, it creates a situation where people create suspicion when they fit into one of the buckets of people you described and they deviate from normative behavior for that pairing.", "I think that was what tipped it for me. Whether the friend was a man or a woman, the fact they changed rooms, to a bedroom and closed the door feels very odd. Why not just close the sitting room door?

Like if I was comforting my best friend and she'd wanted privacy, I wouldn't be immediately going off on one to my partner for coming in.

I don't understand what level of distrust you must have to assume your partner and their friend would go from full on sobbing to fucking, and what level of distrust you must have to think they'd fuck in the house, while OP is still inside the house, when they know there's a good chance OP would see they aren't where they originally are and maybe look to see where they'd gone, incase they were expecting her to join.\n\nIt would be no problem if she knocked & walked in, checked if friend was okay and asked if they wanted drinks, especially as post sob headaches are usually pretty unbearable, but to stand and watch and refuse to leave is just unbelievable. \n\nAnd all the NTA responses?

We've known each other for half our lives, and he's had gfs in the past who didn't like me, were jealous of me, or thought I was trying to one up them in how well I knew my friend, even though I have always tried to be open and welcoming to all his past gfs. Some people just cannot handle their partner being close friends with someone of the opposite sex. \n\nThankfully my friend is now dating a woman whom I adore.

Then she demands privacy in a closed bedroom (another apparent and reasonable boundary) ..that's a huge red flag on both ends.

He and I even slow danced at their wedding while she happily rested her feet and took some cute photos of us with his mom.

This is about boundaries and respect.

I was stuck in that relationship for almost a decade.  I won't even get into the mindfuck that it was but honestly when I read this post initially, I thought that OP was in the wrong for not giving her husband's grieving friend some privacy in her grief.  Grief sucks, and it *is* sometimes a very private thing.\n\nBut all the comments had me second-guessing.  I read it out loud to my current partner, who I consider my relationship with to be very healthy.  And he said the same thing -- hell no, it's not OK for a married man to be in a bedroom alone embracing another woman while explicitly forbidding his wife to be present.\n\nAnd ya know...it made me think that he and those comments are right.  That is, in fact, exactly the kind of rationale my ex would use to make me feel like I was crazy or irrational or controlling while he slept with other women.  Fuck, I remember one night where we hosting an event at his house and one of his lovers was there.  She got puking drunk and he invited her into his private bathroom inside his private bedroom to be drunk in, with doors closed.  I came in and did not like it one bit but you know what?  The mindfuck was so deep that he not only convinced me that it would be insensitive not to let her be there, but then he also *left me there alone with her* and I ended up holding her hair for her while she puked and sobbed about her parental trauma to me, while he went back to the party.\n\nSo...yeah.  Wow.  Guess I'm still reeling a bit even though it's been years and I've had therapy and stuff...manipulation and gaslighting can run so deep when people use seemingly reasonable explanations and appeal to your sense of empathy or guilt in order to normalize things that should not be normal.  Y'all have convinced me NTA and helped me realize some stuff.", "Right. Like if they\u2019d stepped out onto the patio or something, that makes perfect sense.

And even if he doesn\u2019t reciprocate feelings he is still an ah for discounting his wife\u2019s feelings, ordering her about, embarrassing her & pretty much showing his \u201cfriend\u201d that he values her over his wife.", "That's fair in that specific situation.", "Its okay.

We don\u2019t change problematic dynamics by accepting them as an unfortunate part of society, any more than we change them by pretending they don\u2019t exist. Instead, we change them by *learning to recognize them in ourselves and reassess accordingly.* OP doesn\u2019t need to pretend these dynamics aren\u2019t there because they shouldn\u2019t be; but she does need to do some introspection to decide whether these dynamics are present *because that\u2019s the norm she projects into situations,* or because *the stereotype happens to apply to her husband\u2019s personality due to the way he was socialized in society.* essentially, is she seeing something she just expects to see, or something that is really there?\n\n2. The bedroom distinction is a silly one. Sure, people are more likely to cuddle on a bed than on a desk, but if husband and friend were planning to mess around, do you really think they\u2019d be more likely to do it on the guest bed than against a wall, on an office chair, or on a table? Heck, if anything, a mattress would make more noise! No, being in a bedroom doesn\u2019t make it more likely that there was infidelity; aversion to bedrooms is an increasingly-outdated concept that\u2019s more about maintaining appearances than about actual likelihood of deviance.\n\n3. Finally, this post suggests one of two situations: either a) OP was picking up on something inappropriate, and her conclusion was correct even though the facts are inconclusive; OR b) OP is insecure and inserts herself inappropriately, and in fact would have made this friend uncomfortable while their husband could offer genuine platonic support. As readers, we have two sources of bias here: we\u2019re reading the post through OP\u2019s eyes, and our sexist biases predispose us towards OP\u2019s interpretation of the situation. Now, we could just take the easy route, avoid cognitive dissonance, accept our biases and conclude that OP, as a woman, is emotionally intuitive and a man seeking alone time with a woman must be up to no good; or we could challenge our biases and ask OP to offer more concrete justification for her suspicions. Is a man having a close female friend inherently inappropriate? Is a friend being uncomfortable sobbing in front of their friend\u2019s spouse and preferring a room with a closed door inherently suspicious? Can we really assume that OP would have been a harmless presence, and that her discomfort with the situation was driven by the dynamic she observed? \n\nPersonally, I think the appropriate step here would be to ask OP if they have any reason to suspect their husband, and what she thinks was happening or going to happen. We should push OP to question her biases, and consider whether her discomfort was rooted in social norms or something real from her husband. And we should recognize the difference between being aware of the norms of our society, and accepting them.", "Anger isn't an unhealthy emotion, it can be a very useful way our brain gets us to react to a situation we need to react in. We just need to be able to control it and not let it control us.\n\nJealousy serves a similar purpose in some ways. I trust my spouse and I trust myself, but people make mistakes and overstep boundaries. Emotional intimacy with friends is great, but emotional affairs are also a thing that destroys good relationships when people don't set and respect appropriate boundaries. \n\nI don't think OP should have handled things the way she did but the husband yelling at her is also a bad response, so I'd go with ESH. They need to respectfully communicate with each other about these issues. OP said the friend is competitive with her about how close she is with the husband, which isn't cool and the husband needs to set better boundaries with his friend to show respect for his spouse. The wife's insecurities are understandable when the husband won't set good boundaries with his friend. It isn't always about sex, my straight husband had to cut off a male friend who was really disrespectful to me and ended up stalking my sister. Not all friends are respectful towards their friends' marriages.", "I agree with you.\n\nI think OP\u2019s husband knocked up his friend.

I am friends with my fianc\u00e9\u2019s friends.

I won't go into what transpired, because I am sure you all can read similar stories on some sub. They are all the same.\n\nThey were having an emotional affair. I don't know if it would have become physical, but it was definitely moving that way with that embrace. He claims that was the only physical contact they ever had, but there is still a part of me that he is not being fully honest about that.\n\nDH and I are still together, but only because he did some very hard work to prove to me that I could trust him. Marriage counseling helped. It was one of the most difficult and painful periods of my life. I don't recommend it.\n\nI cannot say if there is more to this relationship or not, but the way the DH handled it was out of line and over the top.

The relationship doesn\u2019t sound appropriate. I would feel uncomfortable too.", "I just want to applaud OP for having the spine to tell her husband she\u2019s going to stand right there. THAT is HOW it\u2019s DONE.", "NTA \u2026 are you they are BOTH crying over the list of a dog? It\u2019s a weird vibe but maybe they shared a more significant loss\u2026?", "NTA. #4 is a red flag AND the fact that they became BFFs in adulthood as opposite sex. She \u201cfriend zoned\u201d him (not a thing but guys think it is) and kept him for manipulation to make her feel good. He \u201csettled\u201d for you because he couldn\u2019t have her but she still pulls rank emotionally.", "NTA\n\nIf they need to be in a separate room with the door closed, then what they are doing is not appropriate.\n\nThey're relationship isn't kosher.", "Noooo, no, no, no, NTA", "NTA\u2026 IDC I am not eva gonna be comfortable with another woman in a closed door room with my husband! Y\u2019all can have privacy with the door open\u2026 I stand ten toes down on this", "Nta, he has a thing with her.  Sorry op", "I\u2019m thinking the bff of hubby is jealous. OP mentioned a problem with the friend always bringing up the fact that \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know him like she does\u201d and comparing herself to OP.  Hubby might not see or think that his friend has a thing for him, but this bff comes off that way. OP is definitely NTA and there is no reason why they need to run into a different room and close the door. I\u2019d ask hubby if he would be comfortable if she asked a male friend over and they pulled this shit. It seems sketchy to say the least.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019ve been married for a decade and I would riot if my husband pulled this.", "NTA!!!!! I don\u2019t care how long they\u2019ve been friends! If you can\u2019t join in on their cry fest then he should have met her somewhere else! They\u2019re gonna do it eventually if you don\u2019t step it up!", "NTA - women's instincts (listen to that gut feeling) something was clearly not right about the whole situation. And my personal opinion \"female friends\" always seem to try to cross boundaries.. I will never understand nor will I put up with it. Sorry OP that this is a thing.", "Context #4 is the real issue here, not this one situation. The bff obviously doesnt respect you and neither does your husband if he lets his bff act like that.", "NTA- Exactly what the top comment said, including the edits. They could have easily done this on the couch and I\u2019m sure OP would have given them some distance if they were in a common area of the house. He\u2019s not supporting his wife or giving her priority at all and that\u2019s poor spouse behavior. You don\u2019t do that unless your wife is comfortable with it. My bf has a long time female friend. I have no jealousy there and they go out to dinner once a year or so. He lets me know they are going out and I\u2019m okay with it. But what OP described is shady. It was raise red flags for me too. Her gut is telling her something and I\u2019m one to follow your gut if you\u2019re not a jealous person to start with. If she thinks something may be going on she\u2019s probably right. I had a guy cheat on me more than once and react with this is the exact type of behavior that he would pull. Gaslighting me and turning the tables around to make it my fault or that I was \u201ccrazy\u201d or it was all in my head.       \nSecond, does this girl not have any other friends? As a woman I wouldn\u2019t dream of getting between a couple in this way. If I knew the wife was uncomfortable with our friendship I would not push boundaries and I would not compare myself to her etc.  This \u201cfriend\u201d is not helping the situation AT ALL. In fact, she\u2019s doing her part to actively sabotage the relationship. There are women out in the world like this. They get off on getting men to pay attention to them and like causing problems in a relationship. I will guarantee this friend is jealous of OP because her friend is no longer there to give her his undivided attention. In fact this is exactly what happened to me with another female friend that my bf had. She wanted us to be together because she herself was dating. She played matchmaker and we got together. She and I had a falling out, she then proceeded to try and sabotage the relationship. In part due to our falling out but also in part to when she wasn\u2019t dating because she wanted my bf back to be at her beck and call to do projects around her house! He finally had to just cut her off when he realized what she was doing.", "NTA, it feels inappropriate to be hugging in a room with a closed door after sending you on an errand. Fetch a glass of water so we can run off immediately to a bedroom? Fuck that.", " My gut reaction is that she just lost their baby via miscarriage or abortion.", "Add in her edits and this sounds very much a tale of \u201cthe girl he told me not to worry about\u201d. \n\nOP this girl wants your husband. No mistake.", "Exactly this. I work with mostly men and get along great with them, but everyone makes sure to keep conversations and everything \u201cabove board\u201d so we avoid issues like this. If I need to talk to one of them privately, I message them in a private chat.", "And then if my married male friend screamed at his wife to leave, I\u2019d be even more uncomfortable and apologize to the wife\u2026. Unless I was in love with the married male friend as the best friend in this story seems to be", "> If she was just a friend and needed support, he couldn't have done it in the living room? \n\nYeah, I know I'm always the most comfortable bawling my eyes out in front of people who don't like me.  Seriously, have you ever cried in your life?", "This would totally be a reasonable case if this was the reason. But giving the fact it was about a beloved family pet why would you need that much privacy.", "Thank you for sharing your view with everyone. I think that your perspective  on the situation is more important than most. You are use to your partner being with someone else(forgive me if that wasn\u2019t a sensitive way to put it. I don\u2019t know much about being polyamorous. And I would never want to disrespect someone\u2019s lifestyle.). So the fact you see this as incredibly weird behavior is telling.", "Damn, this honestly adds up more than crying over a dog who isn\u2019t actually dead yet in a enclosed bedroom. OP maybe needs to sit down with them both for an honest discussion.", "If any of my friends are cheating on their spouses, I\u2019m fucking telling. I will support the spouse if they divorce too. I don\u2019t tolerate cheating, it\u2019s bullshit. And bullshit to hide it from someone like that. All of his friends are shitty people for that.", "Ok, going to reveal how clueless I was as a 22 year old...\n\nMet my now ex-wife through a mutual friend and we started dating\n\nMy roomates and I through a party MF came to the party.  Her nana had recently passed away.  We ended up in my room to get some quiet so we could talk about it.  GF came in after a bit and was like time to wrap it up and for the two of us to go to bed.\n\nShe, GF, was upset.  I thought I was just being a good friend.  Well a few weeks later MF made it clear she wanted more than friendship.  I did not see that coming being completely clueless.  \n\nPoint being, OP you are NTA and trust your instincts, my GF saw it even if I didn't.\n\nNote: had nothing to do with her being my ex, that came over a decade later.", "Agreed. They're all terrible people!", "It\u2019s not a funny situation, but your hide and seek comment make me spit out water laughing.", "Same but thankfully I figured it out before we got married. I was so suspicious of my ex-fiance's work friend. I don't know what made me do it, as I'm usually pretty non-confrontational, but one day he came home and *told-not-asked* me that we would be taking care of her pitbull for her for a week. This was obviously not the first sign, but it was the final one.\n\nYeah she moved in a couple days after I moved out.", "NTA. I would not be comfortable with them embracing each other behind closed door either especially bc you already said she boundary stomps so that\u2019s just a no no. Did they lock the door? Bc if so, that makes everything 20x worse. Now I understand being there for your best friend but he could have left the door open. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about this & crying in front of you, but still.", "NTA. How would your husband react if you and a male friend were in a closed bedroom in the same situation? Even if nothing is going on between them, it\u2019s about respect. Your husband could\u2019ve said just give us a minute, leave the door open and we\u2019ll be right out, but instead he made it weird and suspicious.", "NTA. A woman or man should not be seeking physical or emotional support from a married person. This woman needs to go. She\u2019s relying on him for her emotional needs. From a male perspective, this type of emotional intimacy is usually only reserved for romantic relationships. This is why there is always debate over whether men and women can really be friends\u2026.if your husband is playing that role, you have a problem.\n\n\nI had a woman latch onto my husband years ago just as a \u201cfriend\u201d. It caused serious issues. Their friendship isn\u2019t appropriate.", "He wants to fuck her. It\u2019s a short story I wrote about this situation and the title of the story is also \u201che wants to fuck her\u201d", "She's for sure insecure about it.", "We don't know that the OP hasn't voiced issues over the friend's boundary stomping.", "And don\u2019t get me wrong. I love my dog with all my heart. He sleeps in my bed next to me every night. But it\u2019s a dog. The daily calls to have hubby talk you through it and coming to the house to sob in his arms\u2026 seems like she\u2019s milking a situation or needs a therapist. Why isn\u2019t she spending the week doing all of her dog\u2019s favorite things WITH her dog?!? Again I love my dog with all my heart. I cried on multiple occasions when my childhood dog died. But no this was not a public sobbing calling everyone over to the house to get me through event. It was just me being sad. Alone in my house. And then a few months later I got another dog.", "I was thinking this too.", "Even poly people have rules. My partner and I have disclosure of hey I'm dating someone and will be intimate with them. I'd feel some type of way if they did that with someone they consider a friend because going behind closed doors is a little odd. \n\nI have opposite gendered friends and have consoled them but I wouldn't just up and run off to a different room and close the door with them because out of respect for my partner, I'd be as transparent as possible.", "I'm feeling very toxic undertones. Like gaslighing and stonewalling/sllent treatment. And almost looks like he gets off from this given the apparent non sense of making her get water and quickly hide in the room.", "I KNOW that's right!", "He may very well have expected OP, after returning with the water and then finding them in the bedroom, to either not come in or to submit and obey him when he told her to leave them alone. \n\nHe likely did NOT expect for her to stand her ground and enforce boundaries; if it\u2019s gotten to this point, there have probably been a lot of boundaries OP has set which he and his \u201cfriend\u201d stomped on in the past, so he probably expected this to be a similar situation.", "I would really be interested in seeing an update from OP on this situation", "omg my thoughts exactly she was pregnant and lost their baby.", "Yeah men love to play I know zero about my friend can you get stuff for them game.", "NTA ,they are boinking if they aren't doing it already they'll start soon .he doesn't respect u might as well mentally check out from the relation to avoid hurt later", "NTA I would not be comfortable with my spouse embracing their friend in a bedroom with a closed door. Nor would i ever do that with my friends, especially of the oposite sex. \n\nI read too many reddit stories where men/women best friends embrace, then cuddle, get too emotionally involved and then you know what happens next. All while they said we are only friends and not to worry.\nMaybe i am a bit cynical Lol.", "NTA. divorce this man ASAP.", "NTA- I think you need to have a serious conversation how how this looks to people. When you said they were in the guest room I immediately thought he was cheating on you. If he doesn't want to talk maybe leave this out so he can look at it?", "Background: I love my dogs more than nearly anything and my (30F) best mate of 10 years is 30 male. I know his partner, we aren\u2019t \u201cfriends\u201d but we\u2019re cordial. I would NEVER think this was appropriate in the slightest and even the concept of shutting myself away in a bedroom with him is so rude and disrespectful and intimidate that it grosses me out. This behaviour is not ok in the slightest.", "I have a lot of male friends. Some married and some in relationships with either men or women, and some single. I wouldn\u2019t do this to any of them, especially the ones in relationships. \n\nLike a quick supportive hug is fine. But I wouldn\u2019t want to be closed off in a bedroom crying in my friend\u2019s arms *in the home he shares with his wife*. No matter how much I wanted the support or even if our friendship was like that before he got married. \n\nIt\u2019s important to respect the spouse of your friend. I feel this was disrespectful to you. \n\nNTA", "NTA If they would have asked you to leave the living from privacy, it would still be rude but much more appropriate. They went into a private room with a bed and then closed the door and then your husband disrespected you in front of her. Nope", "Red flags, she's a snake.", "Is there an update? Hope OP is ok", "NTA. You're not the one who was out of line. It's unusual for an unrelated man and woman to close the door and have an intimate embrace unless they are in a more-than-platonic relationship. And it's your house, too! Judging by your husband's reaction to your opening the door, I would be uncomfortable as well.\n\nIf I were embracing a friend whose loved one had passed away, I would be *totally fine* with my partner walking into the room. I would keep the door open. With the door open, my partner would see my friend crying and me hugging them and come to the correct conclusion about what was happening.\n\nSo why did he close the door in the first place? Because she wanted privacy? Nope, she does not get private intimate moments with your husband in your own home. I don't trust her intentions because she's disrespecting your relationship with your husband.\n\nUnlike so many of these stories, your husband isn't being over-the-top abusive (although he's in the wrong on several counts). Marriage counseling would be a good step so he can hear a take from an unbiased third party.\n\nThe paranoid side of me thinks this may have been a setup by the friend to start a fight between you and your husband. Your reaction upon opening the door was somewhat predictable - that you would not be OK with the intimate embrace. Only a small percentage of people are probably Machiavellian enough to try something like that, though. My apologies if this makes you feel worse.", "As a man, NTA. Your husband is YOUR man, not anybody else\u2019s. That\u2019s kind of what you both agreed to when you got married. If someone else is trying to subtly suppress that, they need to go. Also, it\u2019s always been my belief that having a \u201cbest friend\u201d of the opposite sex when you\u2019re committed to someone else is just unwise. Your spouse should be your best friend, period. They should be the one you\u2019re closest to, share your life with the most, are the most intimate with (emotionally speaking; physical intimacy is already obvious here). Although you retain your individuality to an extent, a married couple is one team, one unit, one body (so to speak). It makes absolutely no sense to be closer to somebody else than that person, *especially* if the other person is the same sex as your spouse. Her stomping on boundaries and making those comparisons is bad news. I\u2019m only a man so I\u2019m not going to pretend to be able to read a woman\u2019s mind, but if the sexes were reversed I\u2019d say the dude was definitely trying to get into the woman\u2019s pants. That also wasn\u2019t \u201cproper support.\u201d That was asking for trouble.", "I'm with you on this. I've consoled friends in \"intimate\" ways before after deaths or breakups, and every single time my spouse has been present. I didn't care if he saw because we didn't make it weird. I feel like grief or being extremely upset to the point of needing consoling would make someone not give a shit who was around to see it. Trying to shut the door and make it private is odd as hell in my opinion.", "Yeah. Initially I thought op was the A H but reading her contextual comments, I am on the fence. There\u2019s something off about her husband\u2019s friend or their relationship. Husband needs to work with wife to ensure their marriage is strong.", "I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought this was weird."]}
