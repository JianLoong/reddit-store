He was asked to host the bachelor party at our house. I plan to spend the day out of the house. I got a text from my bf saying that I could come back any time after 5. I came home around 6:30. When I get home, everyone is still there along with several girlfriends and the fianc\u00e9. I thought the party ended earlier than anticipated but it did not. \n\nTbh, I felt uncomfortable because it was a bachelor party which is usually just men. But I was told I could come home and there were other girls there so I tried to embrace it. I mingled and helped my bf with hosting(went for a beer/drink run, made sure enough snacks were out, drove drunk people home at the end of the night etc.) I wasn\u2019t really involved in the party activities which I was fine with because I did feel weird being there. \n\nPresent day/this past weekend: we\u2019re at the wedding reception, I don\u2019t even remember how it came up in conversation. Bride and groom loudly announce that I crashed the bachelor party and how much of a jerk move that is. Only the wedding party was invited and that\u2019s who all the girlfriends were (I didn\u2019t put this together at the time of the party). I was stunned. But I stood up for myself and said that my bf told me I could come home, so I did and not even right away. They said the invite should have came from them not my bf. To which I said they should be mad at my bf then, not me? I also pointed out that aside from hosting and mingling, I stayed out of their way. Just because I was home (and in another room) doesn\u2019t mean I \u201ccrashed\u201d it. I live there! They got increasingly upset at my statement and said it was their wedding day and they don\u2019t want to argue about it. Fine, end of conversation. I didn\u2019t even know it was an issue until that interaction. \n\nMy boyfriend was not present for this. I told him what happened and he was furious because the groom told him to call me to come home. But the bride and groom were so drunk that night they don\u2019t remember it. \n\nI\u2019ve been sitting on this for a few days and I\u2019m losing my mind here. It never felt right being at the party. My boyfriend has my back and said they were just drunk and they\u2019ll get over it. They cancelled on our plans tonight but still went without us and posted stories at the restaurant we were supposed to go to. So they\u2019re def still angry. I know typically I\u2019d never be invited to a bachelor party so I\u2019m torn on this. \n\nTl;dr my boyfriend hosted a bachelor party at our house, I was told I could come home, and when I did the party was still ongoing. I mingled and helped out with \u201chosting\u201d duties but didn\u2019t partake in much \u201cpartying\u201d. A month later, the bride and groom are now angry I was there, called me out at their wedding and are now cancelling plans with us.", "created_utc": 1691640998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15n1r3p/aita_for_going_to_a_bachelor_party_that_i27f/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Bfs friends sound like a bunch of mean girls & their boos. Some reasons you're totally in the right:\n\n1. The party was at *your* *house*\n2. You arrived towards the end, did not show up to participate in the full thing\n3. The party was at *your house*\n4. Your bf and his friend invited you to join\n5. The party was at *your fucking house*\n\nTruly recommend you take this blessing and distance yourself from these toxic people. Healthy adults talk about shit that bothers them, they don't stew about it and make snide comments in public. I'm assuming you're no longer in high school, and reasonably you've left the childish behavior behind. Obviously, they have not. Save your energy and just don't fuck with them, they're not worth the drama.", "NTA. Not one bit.\n\nThese \u201cfriends\u201d are infuriatingly childish.\n\nYou did absolutely NOTHING wrong.\n\nit\u2019s really as simple as that.", "NTA \n\nWhy is your boyfriend friends with those A-holes? Time to wash his hands of them. They\u2019re low class and rude. \n\nNot only did he host in your house, to which the groom said to call you back, you also got more booze for the jerks and drive them home. \n\nThese kinds of posts make me want to tear my eyeballs out of my head. Is this Jr high BS really worth your time? Are these \u201cfriends\u201d really worth worrying about? Cut ties and block block block these lying ungrateful jerks.", "So let me get this straight. The Batchelor party was at your house. And all the groomsmen and the groom were there with all their girlfriends/fiancee bc they were part of the wedding party...but they are mad you showed up..at your own house. I would be furious. Friendships would end. Your boyfriend should have never stood for this. And you went out of you way on beer runs and hosting. NtA!!!", "I hope this post gets on TikTok. This is some abhorrent behavior and these newlyweds deserve to get absolutely trashed about this bs. NTA.", "NTA. These friends are really dumb. It\u2019s not even possible to crash a party happening in your own home. You live there. There\u2019s no crashing, you just used your house key. If they didn\u2019t want you there they shoulda did it somewhere else.", "NTA. If they had such an issue with it, they couldve said  something either at the party or after. Instead they announce it at their reception? Wtf? I wouldn\u2019t worry about losing their \u201cfriendship\u201d since they weren\u2019t much to begin with.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend said you could come, so you went. That's between him and the groom. And I have a sneaking suspicion if you got the bride away from the groom, she'd admit she was not just cool with it, but happy you were there.", "NTA What a bunch of AHs they are. You did nothing but help on the night of the bachelor party, and they just want to exclude you. They\u2019re really inexcusably horrible AHs. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with them. You did nothing wrong.", "How the fudge is somebody not going to be invited to a party that is being hosted at their place? Did they pay to rent out your space?? You *catered for free*!!!! You felt like you weren't supposed to be there because you were probably being snubbed, made the best of it, but was outed at their wedding. What a horrible experience, I hope they divorce.\n\nHuge NTA. Kudos to your boyfriend for leaving.", "NTA in the slightest. \n\nFirst of all: it\u2019s your home. If they didn\u2019t want you there then they shouldn\u2019t have been there. \n\nSecond: your boyfriend told you the coast was clear. \n\nThird: they should\u2019ve just shut up about it instead of making a big deal of it.", "NTA\n\nThese people sound miserable to be around. Who clings on to resentment for what was, at most, a mild breech in social decorum, so that they can create a scene at their own wedding? Do they like to pretend their life is a reality tv show? Or a sit-com perhaps?\n\nAll you did was enter your own home after you\u2019d been given the okay to do so. The idea that you\u2019re in the wrong for that is ridiculous. Yes, you felt weird, but you trusted the people around you to be adults and communicate. If they had a problem, they could have approached you there and then. There was no reason to wait until the wedding and make a public display of this conflict after there was nothing more to be done.", "NTA. You fucking live there. It sounds like they have a problem with you and were trying to find a reason to pick a fight with you. Good riddance to them.\n\nAre you a PoC? Cause honestly them being racists would not surprise me.", "NTA - public shaming is really immature behavior. So is their passive aggression with canceling plans etc. It sounds like you were a gracious host. Also a shit move - the party was in your home and you weren't invited.", "I\u2019m very petty so my reaction would\u2019ve been to send them an invoice for the cost of renting a venue. You don\u2019t get to use my home as a free space and have the nerve to publicly disrespect me. On top of that cancelling your plans together and going without you and posting it? I would\u2019ve gone as far as to comment on the post about how sad i am that i couldn\u2019t be there as planned, because they uninvited me after publicly humiliating me after i opened my home for them, FREE OF CHARGE, AND spent the night going out of my way to make them comfortable.", "NTA.  Try not to worry about it; these are your bf's friends, and he has your back.  They sound super immature, but that's his lookout, not yours.", "NTA and really do you and your boyfriend want to be friends with these ungrateful people???? Like what the actual F! They are jerks and if they didn\u2019t want their wedding ruined then why bring it up? Where did they want you to go when they were in YOUR home for the party and really you couldn\u2019t be there because it was wedding party only? They sound clicky and I feel like you have been excluded from other things in the past.", "I didn\u2019t know children could get married. \n\nNTA. They need to grow up.", "NTA at all. You very graciously tried to stay out of your own home for others to have a party there. (I honestly think that as the girlfriend of the host and being someone who lived there, you should have been invited.) You were told it was fine to come home, and when you saw the party was still going, you were either very helpful or chilling in a completely different room. Then you even went out of your way to help with driving all the drunk people home safely. The only thing they should be saying about it is, \u201cThank you for helping when you really didn\u2019t have to!\u201d", "NTA but how insufferable do you have to be to accuse someone of gatecrashing their own home?", "NTA. You did absolutely nothing wrong. Those don\u2019t sound like very good friends.", "NTA\n\nYou live there. You agreed to leave for most of the day and came home when you were told you could (which, btw, was honestly already quite rude of them to ask you to leave your own home)\n\nIf they have an issue, just let the trash take itself out", "NTA whatsoever. You even drove people home that were too drunk. They all sound like a bunch jerks.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t crush anything. You went home 1.5 hours after you were told you could. Kudos for standing up for yourself.", "This is a dumb post, clearly you are NTA.", "NTA. I don't even know your \"friends\" and they are giving me a headache over here.", "Clearly NTA.", "It\u2019s your house!\n\nThey are not your friends. Good that your BF has your back, but you should stop trying to maintain relationship with those people.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

On top of the obvious things, they call you out at their wedding reception, but when you speak for yourself suddenly they don\u2019t want to sour the wedding day with an argument? That\u2019s the equivalent of the old person saying you are disrespectful the moment you say something back.\nI\u2019ve had one person do this to me several times.

She is the GF of one of the groomsmen.  So their statement is false.  What they really meant to say was it was our party and we just didn\u2019t want you there.

I tried to befriend them at the beginning of our relationship. I really did. But they\u2019re insufferable at times. I still am nice to them and will hang out occasionally but we\u2019re not good friends by any means. My boyfriend is nothing like them. He is actually really good at not putting up with bullshit and setting boundaries but there is something about them he can\u2019t stand up to. He complains about them often. I\u2019ve encouraged him to reconsider their friendship because they treat him so poorly and it does bother him. There\u2019s something that he can\u2019t let go of with them. Idk what it is. I\u2019m hoping this opens his eyes a bit", "Not only that but absolutely no one from the bridal party helped with set up or clean up. My boyfriend paid for everything. I helped him with set up because no one showed up early. No one came over the next morning after they trashed our house. Him and I literally did everything for this party.

I did consider just hanging out in my bedroom but no one from the bridal party helped my boyfriend at all. He set the whole thing up himself and paid for everything himself. The best man did nothing planning wise and I feel like he got the shit end of the stick. So I wanted to help him so he could enjoy at least a little bit of the night. So that\u2019s also rubbing me the wrong way with all of this.", "Yeah, like you\u2019re at the main event, let it go.  And it\u2019s so dumb to act like their bridal party is some exclusive club\u2026like their sacred group is going to mean jack shit once the reception ends.  \n\nIt\u2019s so wild how many people spend their engagements full on power tripping.", "Why was your house the place for the party? Why were they drunk enough to not remember telling your bf to call you but sober enough to remember you crashed the party?", "Whether you were part of the wedding party or not, you shouldn't have been excluded. It was your house. You accommodated everyone. They are ungrateful people. It's on your boyfriend to talk to his friend about this and set the record straight. I just don't know if it would be worth continuing the friendship. But I really have a low tolerance for ungrateful people.", "I agree. I think your boyfriend was used to some extent. Why was planning the bach party put on him anyway? Isn\u2019t that best man territory? \n\nIs this a pattern between your boyfriend and his best friend?", "I would love to know that as well. I think because we have the nicest house, it made sense to do it here. The groom didn\u2019t want to go out to bars/clubs. So I think because my boyfriend agreed to host it, it turned into him planning it too. They are best friends, but the groom is not a great friend to my boyfriend. The way he treats him sometimes angers me. My boyfriend actually isn\u2019t bad at setting boundaries, but for some reason he lets this behavior slide with him. The best man should have helped wayyyy more. I\u2019ve never really met him before but he ended up leaving the reception after dinner. So he seems like a real peach."]}
