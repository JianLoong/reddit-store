He was asked to host the bachelor party at our house. I plan to spend the day out of the house. I got a text from my bf saying that I could come back any time after 5. I came home around 6:30. When I get home, everyone is still there along with several girlfriends and the fianc\u00e9. I thought the party ended earlier than anticipated but it did not. \n\nTbh, I felt uncomfortable because it was a bachelor party which is usually just men. But I was told I could come home and there were other girls there so I tried to embrace it. I mingled and helped my bf with hosting(went for a beer/drink run, made sure enough snacks were out, drove drunk people home at the end of the night etc.) I wasn\u2019t really involved in the party activities which I was fine with because I did feel weird being there. \n\nPresent day/this past weekend: we\u2019re at the wedding reception, I don\u2019t even remember how it came up in conversation. Bride and groom loudly announce that I crashed the bachelor party and how much of a jerk move that is. Only the wedding party was invited and that\u2019s who all the girlfriends were (I didn\u2019t put this together at the time of the party). I was stunned. But I stood up for myself and said that my bf told me I could come home, so I did and not even right away. They said the invite should have came from them not my bf. To which I said they should be mad at my bf then, not me? I also pointed out that aside from hosting and mingling, I stayed out of their way. Just because I was home (and in another room) doesn\u2019t mean I \u201ccrashed\u201d it. I live there! They got increasingly upset at my statement and said it was their wedding day and they don\u2019t want to argue about it. Fine, end of conversation. I didn\u2019t even know it was an issue until that interaction. \n\nMy boyfriend was not present for this. I told him what happened and he was furious because the groom told him to call me to come home. But the bride and groom were so drunk that night they don\u2019t remember it. \n\nI\u2019ve been sitting on this for a few days and I\u2019m losing my mind here. It never felt right being at the party. My boyfriend has my back and said they were just drunk and they\u2019ll get over it. They cancelled on our plans tonight but still went without us and posted stories at the restaurant we were supposed to go to. So they\u2019re def still angry. I know typically I\u2019d never be invited to a bachelor party so I\u2019m torn on this. \n\nTl;dr my boyfriend hosted a bachelor party at our house, I was told I could come home, and when I did the party was still ongoing. I mingled and helped out with \u201chosting\u201d duties but didn\u2019t partake in much \u201cpartying\u201d. A month later, the bride and groom are now angry I was there, called me out at their wedding and are now cancelling plans with us.", "created_utc": 1691640998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15n1r3p/aita_for_going_to_a_bachelor_party_that_i27f/", "score": 836, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The Batchelor party was at your house. And all the groomsmen and the groom were there with all their girlfriends/fiancee bc they were part of the wedding party...but they are mad you showed up..at your own house. I would be furious. Friendships would end. Your boyfriend should have never stood for this. And you went out of you way on beer runs and hosting. NtA!!!", "I hope this post gets on TikTok. This is some abhorrent behavior and these newlyweds deserve to get absolutely trashed about this bs. NTA.", "NTA. These friends are really dumb. It\u2019s not even possible to crash a party happening in your own home. You live there. There\u2019s no crashing, you just used your house key. If they didn\u2019t want you there they shoulda did it somewhere else.", "NTA. If they had such an issue with it, they couldve said  something either at the party or after.

You did nothing but help on the night of the bachelor party, and they just want to exclude you. They\u2019re really inexcusably horrible AHs. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with them. You did nothing wrong.", "How the fudge is somebody not going to be invited to a party that is being hosted at their place? Did they pay to rent out your space?? You *catered for free*!!!!

Who clings on to resentment for what was, at most, a mild breech in social decorum, so that they can create a scene at their own wedding? Do they like to pretend their life is a reality tv show? Or a sit-com perhaps?\n\nAll you did was enter your own home after you\u2019d been given the okay to do so. The idea that you\u2019re in the wrong for that is ridiculous. Yes, you felt weird, but you trusted the people around you to be adults and communicate. If they had a problem, they could have approached you there and then. There was no reason to wait until the wedding and make a public display of this conflict after there was nothing more to be done.", "NTA. You fucking live there. It sounds like they have a problem with you and were trying to find a reason to pick a fight with you. Good riddance to them.\n\nAre you a PoC? Cause honestly them being racists would not surprise me.", "NTA - public shaming is really immature behavior. So is their passive aggression with canceling plans etc. It sounds like you were a gracious host. Also a shit move - the party was in your home and you weren't invited.", "I\u2019m very petty so my reaction would\u2019ve been to send them an invoice for the cost of renting a venue. You don\u2019t get to use my home as a free space and have the nerve to publicly disrespect me. On top of that cancelling your plans together and going without you and posting it? I would\u2019ve gone as far as to comment on the post about how sad i am that i couldn\u2019t be there as planned, because they uninvited me after publicly humiliating me after i opened my home for them, FREE OF CHARGE, AND spent the night going out of my way to make them comfortable.", "NTA.  Try not to worry about it; these are your bf's friends, and he has your back.  They sound super immature, but that's his lookout, not yours.", "NTA and really do you and your boyfriend want to be friends with these ungrateful people???? Like what the actual F! They are jerks and if they didn\u2019t want their wedding ruined then why bring it up? Where did they want you to go when they were in YOUR home for the party and really you couldn\u2019t be there because it was wedding party only? They sound clicky and I feel like you have been excluded from other things in the past.", "I didn\u2019t know children could get married. \n\nNTA. They need to grow up.", "NTA at all. You very graciously tried to stay out of your own home for others to have a party there.

You were told it was fine to come home, and when you saw the party was still going, you were either very helpful or chilling in a completely different room.

This is all so insane. Even if you had been there the whole time you would not have been crashing the party, you live there. And you helped out.
