I have only met the couple maybe once or twice and have had no real conversations with them. They have never showed interest in getting to know me although I have tried. So they are practically strangers to me.\n\nThe wedding is a couple states away from us. A group of my boyfriend\u2019s friends, who are also in different states, got an Airbnb to split to attend the wedding, which I was not included in the planning of place or the cost of the house. \n\nMy boyfriend asked me to be his +1 but I have would have to take off two days of work and pay $400, as my part of the Airbnb, because my boyfriend\u2019s friend group decided to split it evenly between all people. \n\nI told my boyfriend that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay to watch strangers get married. Especially when every moment is going to be taken up by wedding weekend activities so this was no vacation. I asked him to talk about the costs with his friends and their thoughts about the situation. Him and all of his friends berated me saying that I needed to pay my fair share and calling me stupid for even suggesting I didn\u2019t pay the full share. \n\nI am 5 years younger than everyone in that friend group and not able to just throw money around for trips like this. I brought up the point that if I didn\u2019t go that no one except my boyfriend would notice and they would have to split the additional cost amongst them anyways. Which if I didn\u2019t go the additional cost would be ~$75 more a person.

If everyone is getting their own room except you and bf, then I could understand wanting it to be divided by room instead of per person. I could also understand wanting your bf to cover your cost as you\u2019re his guest. But it seems like the easiest solution is just not to go.", "YTA.

Plus he will want to hang out with them, recall old stories, and you would just be a third wheel.  This is an  'old friend event'.
