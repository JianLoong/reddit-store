His friend is getting married and my boyfriend was invited to the wedding with a +1. The wedding invitation came out after him and I were dating for quite a while and the couple knew about me. I have only met the couple maybe once or twice and have had no real conversations with them. They have never showed interest in getting to know me although I have tried. So they are practically strangers to me.\n\nThe wedding is a couple states away from us. A group of my boyfriend\u2019s friends, who are also in different states, got an Airbnb to split to attend the wedding, which I was not included in the planning of place or the cost of the house. \n\nMy boyfriend asked me to be his +1 but I have would have to take off two days of work and pay $400, as my part of the Airbnb, because my boyfriend\u2019s friend group decided to split it evenly between all people. \n\nI told my boyfriend that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay to watch strangers get married. Especially when every moment is going to be taken up by wedding weekend activities so this was no vacation. I asked him to talk about the costs with his friends and their thoughts about the situation. Him and all of his friends berated me saying that I needed to pay my fair share and calling me stupid for even suggesting I didn\u2019t pay the full share. \n\nI am 5 years younger than everyone in that friend group and not able to just throw money around for trips like this. I brought up the point that if I didn\u2019t go that no one except my boyfriend would notice and they would have to split the additional cost amongst them anyways. Which if I didn\u2019t go the additional cost would be ~$75 more a person. Not to mention I wouldn\u2019t be taking up additional space because I was going to be sharing a room with my boyfriend. \n\nSo AITA for bringing up that I don\u2019t want to pay to be a +1?", "created_utc": 1689737845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153jjzk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_shell_out_money_for_a/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are NTA for not wanting to spend $ plus vacation days on this event. Your boyfriend is TA for inviting you to his friend\u2019s event at your cost, not covering your cost, pretending that you have a fair share obligation in his event, allowing his friends to call you stupid, berating you, and calling you stupid. Your conflict is solely with him and his treatment of you is not something you should agree to continue. DTMFA\nNote: it is reasonable for you to pay for your own food on the trip, as you should regardless of location. It is not reasonable for you to pay travel and accommodation expenses you cannot afford for an event you would be attending as a favor.", "YWBTA if you went and didn't pay. Look, if you go, you pay. If you don't want to pay, don't go. It's pretty simple, really.", "ESH. I think you went about this the wrong way. If you had an issue with the cost, you should have brought it up with your bf, not his whole friend group. They\u2019re not responsible for your accommodations. If everyone is getting their own room except you and bf, then I could understand wanting it to be divided by room instead of per person. I could also understand wanting your bf to cover your cost as you\u2019re his guest. But it seems like the easiest solution is just not to go.", "YTA. You\u2019re not paying for the wedding, you\u2019re paying for a share in the amenities. If you don\u2019t want to pay, don\u2019t go.

Nothing seems unfair here. You can tell your boyfriend you don't want to go or ask him to pay your share if it's such an issue. \n\nAlso the whole thing about I was reduced to a +1 even though they knew we were dating is kind of a moot point. Because even if you were actually invited you would be attending and have to pay for the stay which you have to anyway as a +1. You yourself said they were practically strangers to you so the feeling is obviously two ways I don't think there's anything to get offended by. \n\nYou stay you pay simple", "INFO: when your boyfriend invited you to be his plus one, did you tell him only if he covers your expenses? Or did you agree to go and then later tell the whole group you didn\u2019t want to pay for the Airbnb?", "Nta to not want to pay- which means you don\u2019t go. No big deal. This is the choice in this situation. If you know the expectation ahead of time, either agree or don\u2019t. You can\u2019t go and not pay.", "Wait so you mean to tell me out of the 6 men in the air b&b, only 1 has a +1???", "Really going for that next +1 invite huh? Put aside the money issue, your attitude is awful YTA", "YTA if you are only now dating for 5 months, then you couldn\u2019t have been \u2018dating for some time\u2019 when the invitations were sent. Five months is not a long time. So it is perfectly reasonable for an invitation to be sent to him (their friend) and his plus one, who may or may not have been you by the time the wedding rolled around. Adding in that they don\u2019t know you, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to invite you personally. \n\nAs for the AirBNB, if you are using the facility, then pay your share. You aren\u2019t paying a fee for the wedding, you are paying to be part of the trip. 10 people using the house, then divide by 10. You don\u2019t charge per room, otherwise 6 guys will cram into one room with sleeping bags and split the cost of one room. \n\nSo I\u2019m the end, of you want to go as his date, then go. If you don\u2019t want to go or pay your share, then don\u2019t.  Just don\u2019t try to dictate how the group, that you have been invited to be part of, should split the costs. Their trip, they booked, if you want to go then your share is $X dollars.", "YTA. You\u2019d all be sharing the Air Bnb, you all should chip in equally.

Budgets are real, and sometimes they suck. Don't go if you can't afford it. If you go, pay your share of the expenses. YTA otherwise.", "Wait, how is everything so expensive? Can the two of you just split a 200$ hotel room?", "ESH. If you can't afford it then tell your boyfriend and don't go. Simple really. If he pressures you then he can pay for it. All in all you don't sound like you want to attend this wedding. As for not being named in the invitation, you said these people were strangers to you and you've only been dating your bf for 5 months. I think that's your answer to why you weren't specifically invited.

That's not a small amount of money to cough up for people you don't know...\n\nId say NAH, your partner should have planned accordingly, and if you're sharing a room then that seems crazy that they're splitting costs per head rather than per room \ud83d\ude05 its not like you're there long enough to accrue utilities that should be split equally. \n\nBeing a +1 to someone who isn't family or part of a bride/groom entourage at a wedding (and you barely know them personally) means they aren't going to stare out the window waiting for your arrival. Just enjoy a weekend off and explain that you have work and can't currently afford the time off and the costs of attending on such short notice.", "NTA  \nJust don't go to the wedding. Then you won't need to take time off or pay part of the AirBnB.", "NTA for not wanting to go because of money. You can\u2019t really expect your boyfriend to pay for you unless he offers. With that being said, if I were him I\u2019d offer to pay since you\u2019re right, you are a +1 instead of a guest, and he\u2019s going / paying regardless so might as well have his gf with him\u2026 if I were you I\u2019d just decline to go. On side note kind, Idk why his friends are involved , it should just be between the two of you.", "Yta. You\u2019ve been together 5 months not 5 years.

It's belittling, verbally abusive. The fact that he let his friends berate OP, too, would be another nail. If he wants you there as his date, he can pay. You don't know these people or owe any of them your money. Plus, now that the guys in the house have insulted you, do you even feel okay staying in a house with them? I'd  nope out of the wedding weekend, and maybe the relationship too, unless he is otherwise marvelous to deal with.", "NAH.  If you can't afford it, don't go.  It's not fair to ask others to pay for you if you go.  Just decline and move on.", "I think a discount is quite a reasonable request. But do you really want to be trapped in an abnb with such awful people?", "ESH- why can\u2019t boyfriend cover your stay?

That was your mistake.   I would have just explained to the bf that you have very limited vacation time and finances are tight, and that you would prefer not to spend them on his friends that you do not know.  Plus he will want to hang out with them, recall old stories, and you would just be a third wheel.  This is an  'old friend event'.  When you are married (may it be to him or someone else) the same will end up applying to family events.  You can't be at both families for Christmas.....or Thanksgiving.....or attend all weddings/birthdays/reunions as a couple.  It will eat up all of your vacation time and vacation money.", "No, one bed, assuming they sleep together, one share of costs. Maybe I\u2019m wrong and they all brought guests. In that case the boyfriend needs to pick up the cost. If you invite someone, you pay", "I brought it up with him to bring up to his friend group.

She's sounds unreasonable. \n\n If she doesn't want to go/can't afford to go, then she needs to just say so.  Instead  of being offended that the couple, whom she's only met once or twice didn't invite her by name.....eyeroll.

That's called going to a wedding.\n\nI guess the question is: do you want to be part of the friend group or not?

But the +1 isn't a big deal and is super common.", "Maybe you don\u2019t realize this, but if they had put your name on the invitation, that means you would be entitled to come with or without your bf.

Your relationship is fairly new so until you have fully bonded with your bf\u2019s friends and family, you\u2019re going to feel like just the plus one at all of the gatherings and events.

I\u2019m not into men paying for everything at all, but here it\u2019s justified.", "His friends should not have to subsidize his trip with you. There is no reason why they should pay for you because you cannot afford the trip.\n\nIf he wants you to go, and you can get the time off work, and you want to go, then he should pay for the trip. Otherwise stay home. But don't expect his friends to pay for you."]}
