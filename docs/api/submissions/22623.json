His friend is getting married and my boyfriend was invited to the wedding with a +1. The wedding invitation came out after him and I were dating for quite a while and the couple knew about me. I have only met the couple maybe once or twice and have had no real conversations with them. They have never showed interest in getting to know me although I have tried. So they are practically strangers to me.\n\nThe wedding is a couple states away from us. A group of my boyfriend\u2019s friends, who are also in different states, got an Airbnb to split to attend the wedding, which I was not included in the planning of place or the cost of the house. \n\nMy boyfriend asked me to be his +1 but I have would have to take off two days of work and pay $400, as my part of the Airbnb, because my boyfriend\u2019s friend group decided to split it evenly between all people. \n\nI told my boyfriend that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay to watch strangers get married. Especially when every moment is going to be taken up by wedding weekend activities so this was no vacation. I asked him to talk about the costs with his friends and their thoughts about the situation. Him and all of his friends berated me saying that I needed to pay my fair share and calling me stupid for even suggesting I didn\u2019t pay the full share. \n\nI am 5 years younger than everyone in that friend group and not able to just throw money around for trips like this. I brought up the point that if I didn\u2019t go that no one except my boyfriend would notice and they would have to split the additional cost amongst them anyways. Which if I didn\u2019t go the additional cost would be ~$75 more a person. Not to mention I wouldn\u2019t be taking up additional space because I was going to be sharing a room with my boyfriend. \n\nSo AITA for bringing up that I don\u2019t want to pay to be a +1?", "created_utc": 1689737845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153jjzk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_shell_out_money_for_a/", "score": 235, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If everyone is getting their own room except you and bf, then I could understand wanting it to be divided by room instead of per person.

Plus he will want to hang out with them, recall old stories, and you would just be a third wheel.  This is an  'old friend event'.

She's NTA for bringing this up as an issue, but of course if they say no to being hospitable then no means no.", "Her share? As far as the OP states, they already booked and paid. Whether she goes or not, the money is exactly the same. If you want things to be \"equal,\" you let her know before booking just like everyone else and you give her her own room just like everyone else. This insistence on \"equality\" is so out of place here, especially with the way they're talking to/about OP now all because she didn't want to give them $400 that BF requested himself.", "They are not paying her share though. They are paying the exact same amount as they would if she were not going. In other words the amount they were originally paying. They are trying to sublet half a room to defray their costs. \n\nOP has been asked to chip in on a house that has already been rented so no additional cost to anyone. Plus she is paying airfare, taking unpaid time off from work or using vacation days, paying for meals, a dress she may need to purchase and all for a couple she has said hello to once or twice.\n\nShe is not asking anyone to pay anything extra for her to be there. Cost would be the same if she is there or not. NTA, just presented to the friends in a poorly worded way by her BF", "The friends really wouldn\u2019t feel the financial effects of it. My boyfriend would have an additional $400 where the friends would only pay $70. Which if I didn\u2019t go they would pay anyways. This friend group will pay 100+ on a bar tab without blinking an eye so money isn\u2019t hard for them. I just thought it was shitty of the friends to not working something out with my boyfriend because then he would have to pay $800. I was not involved with the planning or choosing the Airbnb, if I planned it I would\u2019ve picked something significantly less expensive for everyone. It was already paid for so there really no share, at that point if I did go it would just be lessening the expense for the friends. They were expecting to pay the cost without me there and were fine with the cost when they booked the hotel.", "Based on the Ops responses I'm under the impression that boyfriend actually offered to pay but that she rejected that idea because she thinks it's unfair for him to pay 800 when all his friends are only paying 400 so she wants them to split the cost. OP is a bit young and naive and doesn't seem to understand how the dating world works.", "$200 for a weekend AirBnB is cheap if she had a whole room to herself, her own bathroom, and kitchen space. That's not the case though. She's going as someone's date to crash in his room for a short event. I don't believe her going increases costs at all, at least not from anything that OP said. Also, she's not wrong to bring up that she wasn't invited by name. This event isn't about her at all, and she doesn't have to go. She's saying that money is an issue so that they know why she's not going, even though she's been introduced as a guest's significant other.", "If there are three people staying in an airbnb that costs $1600 they each pay $533. If there are now four people they each pay $400. \n\nIf someone doesnt want to pay $400 to stay, they dont go.", "[deleted]", "Obviously I disagree. This friend group could be hospitable, especially since they failed to clear anything with OP before booking and because she would not be getting a bed/room to herself like every other \"equal\" guest. For a two day trip, I would. And it's certainly an AH move to be offended just because she asked. At that price, without clearing it first, of course a person OP's age is gonna have an issue. BF might even be the AH for not considering that before asking.", "She said she isn't going to give them $400 because she's young, and that makes sense.\n\nShe brought up that they could maybe just let her go along without anyone paying any extra money from what's already booked because they literally could do that. They're choosing not to. Maybe they are justified, maybe they're not, but either way OP is not wrong unless she keeps pushing. It sounds like they were rude to her, which makes me think they are wrong in the first place.", "It\u2019s not an issue with friend group. It\u2019s an issue with her boyfriend. Most likely he is asked to pay 800 for his room and he is passing down the cost. If he agreed for this house for this price for his plus one that that\u2019s on him.\nEdit: typo not faked but asked."]}
