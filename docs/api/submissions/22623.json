His friend is getting married and my boyfriend was invited to the wedding with a +1. I have only met the couple maybe once or twice and have had no real conversations with them. They have never showed interest in getting to know me although I have tried. So they are practically strangers to me.\n\nThe wedding is a couple states away from us. A group of my boyfriend\u2019s friends, who are also in different states, got an Airbnb to split to attend the wedding, which I was not included in the planning of place or the cost of the house. The house was chosen and paid for before I was asked to come. The split for everyone would be ~$475. Everyone was already expecting to pay $475, me out of the picture. When I was asked to attend they decided it should be $400 and everyone pay that. So if I were to come I would knock $75 off of everyone\u2019s part. I was not part of any decision making. I would have gotten a much cheaper hotel room with just my boyfriend.\n\nMy boyfriend asked me to be his +1 but I have would have to take off two days of work and pay $400, as my part of the Airbnb, because my boyfriend\u2019s friend group decided to split it evenly between all people. My thought, which is a metaphor, is it that every invitee was getting a piece of the pie, but my boyfriend and I are sharing a piece of pie. \n\nI told my boyfriend that I shouldn\u2019t have to pay $400 to watch strangers get married. Especially when every moment is going to be taken up by wedding weekend activities so this was no vacation. I asked him to talk about the costs with his friends and their thoughts about the situation. Him and all of his friends berated me saying that I needed to pay my fair share and calling me stupid for even suggesting I didn\u2019t pay the full share. \n\nI am 5 years younger than everyone in that friend group and not able to just throw money around for trips like this. I brought up the point that if I didn\u2019t go that no one except my boyfriend would notice and they would have to split the additional cost amongst them anyways. Not to mention I wouldn\u2019t be taking up additional space because I was going to be sharing a room with my boyfriend. If I was pay by bed then it would be a conversation with just my boyfriend but when it\u2019s pay equally when I was never even involved in the decision is where I was asking for adjustments. \n\nI am not asking the friends to foot the bill for anything, I am asking my boyfriend to talk to his friends about keeping the original split. I would work out costs or anything else with just my boyfriend. \n\nSo AITA for not wanting to pay a full price to be a +1?", "created_utc": 1689737845, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153jjzk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_shell_out_money_for_a/", "score": 613, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are N T A  for not wanting to spend $ plus vacation days on this event. Your boyfriend is TA for inviting you to his friend\u2019s event at your cost, not covering your cost, pretending that you have a fair share obligation in his event, allowing his friends to call you stupid, berating you, and calling you stupid. Your conflict is solely with him and his treatment of you is not something you should agree to continue. DTMFA\nNote: it is reasonable for you to pay for your own food on the trip, as you should regardless of location. It is not reasonable for you to pay travel and accommodation expenses you cannot afford for an event you would be attending as a favor.\n\nEDIT: BF indeed offered to cover all of OP\u2019s lodging costs (1/8 of total). However, OP feels that her attendance is irrelevant as she is sharing a bed, and asked BF and friends to revert to a 1/7 split, which none of them wanted to do. OP also never communicated directly to the friends.\n\nNEW JUDGMENT: ESH, boyfriend as above (though less so since he did intend to cover her costs); OP for being an unreliable reporter, for trying to change plans instead of responding to the invitation she was given, for interfering with her BF\u2019s friendships and finances, for refusing to see that her attendance is consequential to the other people staying there, and for misrepresenting the situation. The friends might also be TA for being rude to OP but it\u2019s unclear whether they called her herself or her action stupid, and the latter certainly is.", "YWBTA if you went and didn't pay. Look, if you go, you pay. If you don't want to pay, don't go. It's pretty simple, really.", "ESH. I think you went about this the wrong way. If you had an issue with the cost, you should have brought it up with your bf, not his whole friend group. They\u2019re not responsible for your accommodations. If everyone is getting their own room except you and bf, then I could understand wanting it to be divided by room instead of per person. I could also understand wanting your bf to cover your cost as you\u2019re his guest. But it seems like the easiest solution is just not to go.", "YTA. You\u2019re not paying for the wedding, you\u2019re paying for a share in the amenities. If you don\u2019t want to pay, don\u2019t go.

Nothing seems unfair here. You can tell your boyfriend you don't want to go or ask him to pay your share if it's such an issue. \n\nAlso the whole thing about I was reduced to a +1 even though they knew we were dating is kind of a moot point. Because even if you were actually invited you would be attending and have to pay for the stay which you have to anyway as a +1. You yourself said they were practically strangers to you so the feeling is obviously two ways I don't think there's anything to get offended by. \n\nYou stay you pay simple", "INFO: when your boyfriend invited you to be his plus one, did you tell him only if he covers your expenses? Or did you agree to go and then later tell the whole group you didn\u2019t want to pay for the Airbnb?", "Nta to not want to pay- which means you don\u2019t go. No big deal. This is the choice in this situation. If you know the expectation ahead of time, either agree or don\u2019t. You can\u2019t go and not pay.", "Wait so you mean to tell me out of the 6 men in the air b&b, only 1 has a +1???", "Really going for that next +1 invite huh? Put aside the money issue, your attitude is awful YTA", "YTA if you are only now dating for 5 months, then you couldn\u2019t have been \u2018dating for some time\u2019 when the invitations were sent. Five months is not a long time. So it is perfectly reasonable for an invitation to be sent to him (their friend) and his plus one, who may or may not have been you by the time the wedding rolled around. Adding in that they don\u2019t know you, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to invite you personally. \n\nAs for the AirBNB, if you are using the facility, then pay your share. You aren\u2019t paying a fee for the wedding, you are paying to be part of the trip. 10 people using the house, then divide by 10. You don\u2019t charge per room, otherwise 6 guys will cram into one room with sleeping bags and split the cost of one room. \n\nSo I\u2019m the end, of you want to go as his date, then go. If you don\u2019t want to go or pay your share, then don\u2019t.  Just don\u2019t try to dictate how the group, that you have been invited to be part of, should split the costs. Their trip, they booked, if you want to go then your share is $X dollars.", "YTA. You\u2019d all be sharing the Air Bnb, you all should chip in equally. You\u2019re not paying to see a wedding, you\u2019re paying for the accommodations you\u2019ll be using.", "It is fine to not go, but it isn't fine to expect all the others to pay for you if you do go. Budgets are real, and sometimes they suck. Don't go if you can't afford it. If you go, pay your share of the expenses. YTA otherwise.", "Wait, how is everything so expensive? Can the two of you just split a 200$ hotel room?", "ESH. If you can't afford it then tell your boyfriend and don't go. Simple really. If he pressures you then he can pay for it. All in all you don't sound like you want to attend this wedding. As for not being named in the invitation, you said these people were strangers to you and you've only been dating your bf for 5 months. I think that's your answer to why you weren't specifically invited.

That's not a small amount of money to cough up for people you don't know...\n\nId say NAH, your partner should have planned accordingly, and if you're sharing a room then that seems crazy that they're splitting costs per head rather than per room \ud83d\ude05 its not like you're there long enough to accrue utilities that should be split equally. \n\nBeing a +1 to someone who isn't family or part of a bride/groom entourage at a wedding (and you barely know them personally) means they aren't going to stare out the window waiting for your arrival. Just enjoy a weekend off and explain that you have work and can't currently afford the time off and the costs of attending on such short notice.", "NTA  \nJust don't go to the wedding. Then you won't need to take time off or pay part of the AirBnB.", "NTA for not wanting to go because of money. You can\u2019t really expect your boyfriend to pay for you unless he offers.

You don't know these people or owe any of them your money. Plus, now that the guys in the house have insulted you, do you even feel okay staying in a house with them? I'd  nope out of the wedding weekend, and maybe the relationship too, unless he is otherwise marvelous to deal with.", "NAH.  If you can't afford it, don't go.  It's not fair to ask others to pay for you if you go.  Just decline and move on.", "I think a discount is quite a reasonable request.

His friends only agreed to accommodate her if their costs went down.", "Yes!  Hotels are so much better, and so much cheaper than the new fad of Air BnB's.  The cleaning fee alone is stupid. NTA", "No no. My suggestion was that they keep the original split and then I split with my boyfriend. I didn\u2019t refuse trying to make his friends pay for me. They got the house and paid for it before I was even asked to go. My boyfriend really wanted me to go so he said he would pay the $800 and we could work something out. $800 is way too much for a person to spend so said he should talk to his friends about the original cost and then I work out that price with my boyfriend. I would not be staying there for free or expected the friends to cover my share or split it. The Airbnb cost was factored without me and the friends were expected to pay $475.", "yeah just saw that, gotta love how one sided these stories can be", "Exactly and I can\u2019t drink so I know I would be taking care of all these drunk adults and cleaning up the place so we didn\u2019t get an over the top cleaning fee like I always do.", "This post best sums up the options available here.  Anyone else saying she should stay for free as OP are the same people that constantly bum free rides without offering to cover some gas money since to them it costs nothing extra to jump into the car.", "You are asking to stay for free essentially. If you don't go, everyone pays $475. But if you go and follow your idea, everyone still pays $475. So how are you not asking to be included for free?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153jjzk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_shell_out_money_for_a/jsl39bo?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2\n\nShe said that in her comments", "She\u2019s young and being pressured. Not cool.", "OP - Just let your boyfriend pay! You\u2019re probably causing a bigger headache to your boyfriend by creating this drama than the financial cost of the extra $400. \n\nYes, there are probably cheaper lodging options than this Airbnb but a lot of weddings serve as a reunion of sort for guests and their friends. Your boyfriend probably thought this was a great way to spend time with you and have you get to know his friends and he was willing to pay the extra $400 to spend time with both you and his friends. \n\nAs a married person, I\u2019ve gone on plenty of trips with my single friends and we\u2019ve split the cost by headcount instead of by bedroom. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t always feel fair but do remember that in an Airbnb, you\u2019re not just paying for the bedroom space but the common area and the amenities which everyone has access to.", "You making this SOOOO complicated.\n\nYou didn\u2019t get a choice in lodging I get it, you got invited to stay at their Airbnb in what world would this not be divided by EVERYONE staying? I\u2019d understand if you aren\u2019t even staying the whole weekend but sounds like you are. \n\nYou\u2019re choices are \n\n1- don\u2019t go problem solved no money spent no time off work. As much as you\u2019ve mentioned the wedding is for \u201cstrangers\u201d why is this such a big deal, just say no??\n\n2- go and STOP. COMPLAINING. Your bf is paying for you. \n\n3-continue to complain and then have your bf of 5 months friends not like you which isn\u2019t a good outlook for the future of your relationship.", "I would be splitting something with my boyfriend because we are splitting a room. So not staying there for free. Every wedding invitee gets 1 piece of the pie. I am sharing a piece of pie with one invitee. So half of the cost.", "Is everyone getting their own rooms or are there some friends who would be sharing rooms?", "She isn't a victim.  You are making her out to be.  She could say no, but she is pressuring everyone else to do what she wants.", "Yeah, once he offered to pay this ceased to be her problem or something she had a reason to weigh in on. I think reasonable minds can differ about the fairest way to split an air b&b when there's a mix of couples and singles (pay per person vs per bed vs some in-between), but at this point it's totally between the boyfriend and his friends, no reason for her to be involved.", "My mistake on the fact that you were originally going to try and pay. But that part is already resolved between you and your BF and he is paying for you. \n\nBut regardless, you and your boyfriend are responsible for paying for your lodging. It is not his friend\u2019s responsibility to pay so that you have a free place to stay all weekend. If you\u2019re going to be staying in the Airbnb, then you absolutely should be accounted for in the costs. Your BF seems to understand this and agreed without complaint. But you are upset for some reason? \n\nYou are right that you could find a hotel for cheaper costs, but it seems like your BF wants to be in the AirBnB with his friends. And doesn\u2019t mind paying more for it.", "What piece of the pie? This isn't about the wedding at all really. This is about accomodations, it doesn't matter if you were a +1 or directly invited, you're going to be occupying space at this AirBNB. To everyone else in the house, you're staying for free, they are subsidizing your stay.\n\nYou and your BF are not a single entity, despite what you want to claim. You are going to occupy time in the bathroom, living room, etc. \n\nI could see an argument for a different split, like 425/ea from his friends and you and your BF cover rest, since you're sharing a room, but I'm sure you'll want the biggest, nicest room since you're the couple.", "If couples have their own room and singles have their own room why should a single bedroom with a couple in it cost them twice what another single bedroom cost?", "Dude, YTA. It's quite reasonable to split a house by person. That's the arrangement they're using. You are a person, therefore you are counted in the split. If you're not going, they pay more, but there's also one less person in their space. That's called a benefit. If you go, there's one more person in their space but they pay less. \n\nSecond, it is your boyfriend's money and he gets to decide how to spend it. If this wedding weekend is worth $800 to him, that's a decision he gets to make. \n\nEither go and pay, go and let your boyfriend pay, or don't go. Picking a fight with his entire group of friends isn't going to end well with you - the chances of him picking you over his friends are slim-to-none.", "Point is - her bf wants her to go but she cannot afford it. So bf told her he would cover her share if she comes. It is his problem, not his friends. She makes drama over something that could be handled easily and doesn't affect her (over financial aspect).", "Exactly. And saying that she showed efforts while they didn't... Girl, you have been dating your bf for probably less then half time than the couple had been engaged. With work and all wedding planning, you expect them to accomodate to you... I cannot believe this is real.", "She exactly expects for his friends to pay for her just becouse the house is already booked. 6 guys planned to spend time together and one of them decides to bring his +1 along. They agreed so it would lower the cost even if it breaks group dinamic. And now she is against her partner paying for both of them and wants to stay for free there.\nI am not sure how she was expected to be given any input about the place when she wasn't even invited at that time?", "It's frozen, it's fineeeeeeee", "Yeah like the whole financial issue is about the accommodation/lodging. But in this case, it\u2019s hard to see a situation where OP gets what she wants."]}
