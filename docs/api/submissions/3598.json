Sure, if it were MY kid, it would be a very long time before they got another gift, and that would be after months and months of providing service to children in need, donating to children\u2019s organizations, etc. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what you would do too. But the reality is, it isn\u2019t your kid, and nothing you do in the limited time you see him will change his behavior. \n\nShort of blowing things up with the in-laws, it seems you have a couple options. 1) Keep handing the kid money in a card. If that feels too simple, there are money puzzles on Amazon for around $5 that are cute and would make it seem a little more exciting. 2) Get him the least expensive thing on his list and call it a day. That wouldn\u2019t honestly take much more effort on your part than money in a card. \n\nAt the end of the day, being right doesn\u2019t always mean you should keep doing it. Do you have an otherwise good relationship with your husband? It seems that this bothers him. It wouldn\u2019t take much effort on your part to do this for him, even if his nephew doesn\u2019t deserve it.

Those kids haven't received a single gift from us since. We asked what they wanted, mom gave us ideas and they weren't really wanted by the kids and every time we came over the items were put away somewhere the kids couldn't reach anyways. We gave them a toy fisher price phone one year and it's was a big hit with the cousins but every time it got used nephew said it wasn't for playing with according to mom.
