Yeah, that sound right... not. \n\nHave either the boy or his parents said anything? Because many 11 year old actually love the freedom of spending money... (mine made a point of putting it on their wishlist)\n\nI still think NTA, but maybe you could try to find out more from the boy and his parents", "I think they mean sending an entitled brat 100 when he throws a tantrum is just reinforcing bad behavior. I'd send $20 or nothing.", "But if you enabled his behavior by giving the kid the gifts he wants, you would be complicit in setting him down a bad path.\n\nIf there are never consequences for the kid's behavior, if he just has to throw a tantrum to get what he wants, he might think\u2026 idk\u2026 he can bully his classmates and get away with it, or he may develop anger control problems the day he doesn't get what he wants.\n\nSure, he's not your son, you don't have the right to parent him, but I would discuss your (right) concerns with his parents.\n\nNot to mention that tantrums are routine for toddlers. For a 11yo? Not so routine.", "No problem! I hope everything works out! :)", "I get it but you're still rewarding his bad behavior. That's lot of money for an ungrateful child.", "And yet he is being too lazy to go out and buy (or order) a gift himself.", "And yet he is being too lazy to go out and buy (or order) a gift himself.", "You are well within your rights to be annoyed by that behaviour. You are owed an apology. Although it\u2019s hard to tell from this one incident as described here, it sounds like SIL is raising a rather entitled, spoiled child. That will only cause him difficulties later on.", "Wow.", "I  would do exactly what you are doing or my husband would be the one shopping for nephew\u2019s present so he can get yelled at it when it\u2019s not the right thing.\n\nBut I can\u2019t help but think of how mad my mom and dad would have been if my siblings or I acted that way when getting a gift. There has definitely been a time or two that I wasn\u2019t fond of something, but I never would have let who bought it for me know that.", "That doesn't surprise me.  Well, it's up to you but I wouldn't give him a thin dime or a rotten piece of fruit as a gift until he grows up, apologizes and stops acting like such an entitled little beast.  And if his parents have an issue with it, that's their problem.", "If he was 18, I would answer differently. But kids can be little jerks, and kids, unlike adults, can change.", "Ha!!", "Exactly!", "They just ignore it until he stops.", "Lmao!", "Not a damn thing! He screamed and kicked the box and was ungratful as hell you get NOTHING from me ever again.", "My husband would be mortified if we went to his family without a gift for the kid. It is definitely Not my place to parent him, I have my own child to worry about. And my SIL does not like when people parent her son especially when she is there. So I just kept quiet and walked away.", "It's not that he hates cash...it's that there is nothing else for him to open but a card. And my daughter is opening a bunch of presents.", "I did not mention it to anyone but my husband. My only reaction, on the day of, was disgust and telling my SIL the gift can be returned.  No one has said anything but they never sent lists until I started giving cash.", "It's not my family it's my husband's family. If it were my family it would have been a different situation.", "I would be mortified if my daughter ever did anything like that!!! So embarrassed I wouldn't be able to stop apologizing for her behavior and making her apologize as well.", "He has had no home training to act like that.  I can see being disappointed with a gift, but that kind of tantrum?  All the nopes.  11 is plenty old enough to know not to act like that.", "To me, not doing anything=enabling. Not cool.", "Yeah, that shit behavior is for toddlers, the kid is 11, old enough to know better than that. old enough to understand that shitty behavior means i ain\u2019t giving you shit.", "If your husband wants him to have \u201cpresents\u201d then he is free to take the list and go out and purchase from it otherwise nephew will continue to get the gift card or nothing its his choice at this point. You dont have to parent your nephew but you sure as shit dont have to reward and enable ungrateful crappy behavior either the gift card is VERY generous of you.", "You should tell your husband that he is now responsible for his family\u2019s gifts.  Why are you putting any effort into any of this? It would be bad enough if your time and efforts were not being appreciated. It\u2019s a whole extra level to be receiving criticism.", "I get what you\u2019re going for\u2026but 11 year old me was STOKED to get $100 each year from my grandpa. I personally don\u2019t think you\u2019re being petty enough. This kid shouldn\u2019t get $100 from you.", "again, your husband can go shopping and deal with nephew's rudeness when his choices don't make the grade.", "And your husband is the one who thinks its petty?\n\nWell then, if he wants **his** nephew to have gifts and not cash, then he needs to be the one to go do the shopping. And after a time or two of having his nephew tantrum over being given the wrong thing that he'd gotten, he might just realize why you'd switched.\n\nIf he doesn't want to do the shopping, then he needs to keep his opinion to himself.", "Eh. Kid could be neurodivergent, could have emotional issues, could have plain bad parenting. Kids can learn and grow.", "He is a very smart kid, but the parenting style they use differs from mine. They ignore the behavior instead of feeding it. But this is the result of it being ignored.", "You could even have a conversation directly with the kid, you could say my feelings were very hurt when you reacted that way to the gift I gave you, even if you don\u2019t like a gift, you say thank you. See how that goes.", "I wouldn't do that only bc it's my in laws and my SIL doesn't appreciate the whole it takes a village bit. The last thing I want is to have an argument over what I said to her son."]}
