Which gives he wasn\u2019t actually listening to her. \n\nHe completely disregarded her actual wants & he instead tried to pacify her w a gift that she never asked for. The gift was sweet but low effort especially for an 11 year anniversary gift. \n\nOp I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re getting flagged as TA but that\u2019s bc most ppl on this thread choose accept the bare minimum and accepts whatever is thrown their way. \n\nIf your husband truly wanted to treat you for your anniversary he\u2019d get the gift you\u2019d actually wanted.

You can simply say you're going to exchange them for a different pair if you think that's necessary.

You literally told him exactly what you wanted, I assume based on your description it was financially feasible, I don\u2019t understand why he wouldn\u2019t do what you wanted? Like maybe he thought it was sweet to \u201cremember\u201d something you said you wanted but you didn\u2019t say you wanted those, you literally said you wanted to try other options before committing. Idk I\u2019m with you girl", "NTA\n\nExchanging a gift should never be a reason to be angry, especially since you told him at the time you were not sure. \n\nGet the birks you want and order your own ring, this dude cleary does not listen to you.", "YTA. \n\n\"Low effort gift\"? What's wrong with you? You're a brat.", "NTA", "YTA. You sound horrible to give gifts for. \"It wasn't the particular one I wanted so I want to take it back\" is just super self-absorbed.

He knows you are a tad difficult to shop for and he was doing a really nice thing.", "YTA. It doesn't appear that low effort: you actually liked them, you admit you're indecisive when spending that much money and he probably thought \"aha, I'll buy something she likes but doesn't want to spend the money on.\"  Have these and then research other shoes you can buy as well. Or don't buy any more and get the cheap ring from the link you sent (which *is* low effort).", "I think it makes sense that everyone's feelings are hurt.

Sounds like it requires an open, honest conversation from a place of kindness and respect (remember that saying \"honesty without kindness is often cruelty\"). This is manageable if everyone's willing to hear each other out, maybe even a chance to find room for growth and new happiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPerhaps you can say that you've both been giving smaller efforts bc that's what was available to give at the time, but things have stabilized and you want to reconnect.

Re read your post as if a stranger wrote it and you were reading it for the first time and see if it\u2019s reasonable, spoiler it isn\u2019t! It\u2019s just rude. Why couldn\u2019t you buy your own ring? Your husbands never going to want to get you anything again with that attitude, your being mean.

A few months ago my husband mentioned needing a new wallet. I bought him one as our anniversary gift. In my mind, that\u2019s thoughtful. I listened to what he said he needed, remembered it and surprised him with it. Your husband was under the impression you like these shoes and decided to surprise you. I know you said you needed to think about it, but he may have thought it was due to the price and he wanted to take that burden of considering cost away from you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for wanting to return the gift since you hadn\u2019t made up your mind on the shoes yet, but I do think you\u2019re an asshole for calling his gift \u201clow effort\u201d.", "YTA.

Your indecisiveness was read as a massive hint that you wanted the birkenstocks.

How could you think that you're not the AH?? You picked them out. Said you liked them. Didn't purchase because of anxiety over price. Husband listened. Paid attention to which specific shoe you chose. Cut the anxiety of price comparing for you. Went back and purchased said item THAT YOU LIKED. And you're upset.

It wasnt what i wanted sooooo it\u2019s low effort.", "YTA your extremely ungrateful i was expexting you to say he got you some leggings or something when you said 'low effort' that was quite observant of him not many husbands would do that", "YTA yikes", "YTA. That is not a low effort gift. That is your husband listening and seeing how happy you were when you tried them on. And maybe he didn\u2019t understand that you wanted to do more research into other types but he probably also knows you\u2019re less likely to spend a bunch on yourself. I have a husband who does this sometimes. Your husband did something nice and you should be grateful.", "YTA how is that low effort? he remembered that you really liked something but wouldn't get it for yourself and went back and got it for you. \n\nalso why do people think they can dictate what gift is given to them? a \"gift\" is supposed to be a voluntary way of showing appreciation to someone, it should not be an obligation. just be grateful.", "ESH\n\nYou are an AH for characterizing his gifts as low effort.  He made the effort to remember something you like and make a special trip to the mall to get it.  That puts him ahead of 75% of the partners I know. It would serve you well to show as much appreciation as you can muster for his efforts. \n\nHowever, he's an AH for two reasons.  Firstly, he did not pay attention to what you said, i.e., that you weren't actually sure that you liked them. Or if he did pay attention, he ignored or discounted you. Secondly, he's mad at you for not wanting to keep shoes that are wrong for you. Shoes have to be right, or they become a waste of space and money. At age 37, he should know that.", "YTA. I'd be freaking happy with a new pair of shoes rather than an updated ring. What's wrong with the ring? Also I wouldn't consider birkenstocks low effort, they're not cheap by any means.

After five years of some friendships, I know how my friends deliberate or decide things, not to mention someone I'm in partnership with. While DH did get a gift, he went out at the last minute to get something that OP had said needed more decision time, after having agreed to get OP what was specifically asked for, linked, and discussed. A lot of the YTA seem to be \"be grateful that he did anything\" which seems like an exceedingly low bar, while the NTA seem to be that OP communicated and DH reneged on what was agreed upon.

Mine is struggling more, so I'm looking to upgrade and look for one that can do some extras.  \n**Dad**: \\*buys a random, though at least same brand as the old one, sewing machine without any input from mum (or even me) and without doing any research into what it can and can't do. \n\nHe did this with a lot of stuff, buying things that are close to what mum said, but never exactly what she wants / needs. It is a very annoying: you have something you don't want or can't use for what you specifically need, and you cannot show your annoyance because dad might (and will!) feel insulted. \n\nSame with jewelry.  \nDad: mum likes purple.  \nMe: yes, but that's specific item is not mum's style. It's too small and too close to her neck.  \nDad: I can buy whatever I want for my wife  \nMe: she is not going to wear it  \nDad: I beg the differ, I know mum  \nApparently he didn't because guess what piece of jewelry she never wore and after a couple of years has been secretly given to one of my cousins...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, it is just lazy work of my dad. Because if he really listened to my mum, he would know exactly what mum wants. He just needs to pay attention and not just half-listen. It's the same with OP's husband. \n\nOther example that really happened: when my sibling and I were a lot younger, we wanted a Gameboy for Christmas (and birthdays combined) we begged and even suggested Dad that grandparents, godparents, any other family that wanted to give us a present, should just donate for a Gameboy (we had saved some money to buy a game once we had it)... if he thought it was too expensive. You know what we got? A handheld gamecomputer that can only play 3 forms of tetris. It s\\*cks when you communicate very clearly and ask for \\[Item A\\] and you get \\[Item a'\\].
