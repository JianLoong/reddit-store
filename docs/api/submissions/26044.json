I know you said you needed to think about it, but he may have thought it was due to the price and he wanted to take that burden of considering cost away from you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for wanting to return the gift since you hadn\u2019t made up your mind on the shoes yet, but I do think you\u2019re an asshole for calling his gift \u201clow effort\u201d.", "YTA.

How could you think that you're not the AH?? You picked them out. Said you liked them. Didn't purchase because of anxiety over price. Husband listened.

It wasnt what i wanted sooooo it\u2019s low effort.", "YTA your extremely ungrateful i was expexting you to say he got you some leggings or something when you said 'low effort' that was quite observant of him not many husbands would do that", "YTA yikes", "YTA. That is not a low effort gift. That is your husband listening and seeing how happy you were when you tried them on. And maybe he didn\u2019t understand that you wanted to do more research into other types but he probably also knows you\u2019re less likely to spend a bunch on yourself. I have a husband who does this sometimes. Your husband did something nice and you should be grateful.", "YTA how is that low effort? he remembered that you really liked something but wouldn't get it for yourself and went back and got it for you. \n\nalso why do people think they can dictate what gift is given to them? a \"gift\" is supposed to be a voluntary way of showing appreciation to someone, it should not be an obligation. just be grateful.", "ESH\n\nYou are an AH for characterizing his gifts as low effort.  He made the effort to remember something you like and make a special trip to the mall to get it.  That puts him ahead of 75% of the partners I know. It would serve you well to show as much appreciation as you can muster for his efforts. \n\nHowever, he's an AH for two reasons.  Firstly, he did not pay attention to what you said, i.e., that you weren't actually sure that you liked them. Or if he did pay attention, he ignored or discounted you. Secondly, he's mad at you for not wanting to keep shoes that are wrong for you. Shoes have to be right, or they become a waste of space and money. At age 37, he should know that.", "YTA. I'd be freaking happy with a new pair of shoes rather than an updated ring. What's wrong with the ring? Also I wouldn't consider birkenstocks low effort, they're not cheap by any means.

After five years of some friendships, I know how my friends deliberate or decide things, not to mention someone I'm in partnership with. While DH did get a gift, he went out at the last minute to get something that OP had said needed more decision time, after having agreed to get OP what was specifically asked for, linked, and discussed. A lot of the YTA seem to be \"be grateful that he did anything\" which seems like an exceedingly low bar, while the NTA seem to be that OP communicated and DH reneged on what was agreed upon.

Mine is struggling more, so I'm looking to upgrade and look for one that can do some extras.  \n**Dad**: \\*buys a random, though at least same brand as the old one, sewing machine without any input from mum (or even me) and without doing any research into what it can and can't do. \n\nHe did this with a lot of stuff, buying things that are close to what mum said, but never exactly what she wants / needs. It is a very annoying: you have something you don't want or can't use for what you specifically need, and you cannot show your annoyance because dad might (and will!) feel insulted. \n\nSame with jewelry.  \nDad: mum likes purple.  \nMe: yes, but that's specific item is not mum's style. It's too small and too close to her neck.  \nDad: I can buy whatever I want for my wife  \nMe: she is not going to wear it  \nDad: I beg the differ, I know mum  \nApparently he didn't because guess what piece of jewelry she never wore and after a couple of years has been secretly given to one of my cousins...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, it is just lazy work of my dad. Because if he really listened to my mum, he would know exactly what mum wants. He just needs to pay attention and not just half-listen. It's the same with OP's husband. \n\nOther example that really happened: when my sibling and I were a lot younger, we wanted a Gameboy for Christmas (and birthdays combined) we begged and even suggested Dad that grandparents, godparents, any other family that wanted to give us a present, should just donate for a Gameboy (we had saved some money to buy a game once we had it)... if he thought it was too expensive. You know what we got? A handheld gamecomputer that can only play 3 forms of tetris. It s\\*cks when you communicate very clearly and ask for \\[Item A\\] and you get \\[Item a'\\].

He didn\u2019t get what you wanted. And specifically, clearly asked for. And the gift you wanted was a much more appropriate gift for an anniversary.\n\nIf I asked for a $200 ring and instead I got $80 shoes that are \u201cpractical\u201d I\u2019d be fucking annoyed. Give me my jewelry!! This is a fancy occasion!", "NTA", "ESH. \n\nHe should\u2019ve just gotten you the ring you discussed (although I understand the feeling of wanting to get something more unexpected then exactly what they asked for). You should\u2019ve just said thank you for the gift, and got yourself the ring (you were going to get yourself the shoes, so you\u2019re ending up with both anyway). Also if you want a different style of shoes just exchange them.", "YTA\nBe thankful for everything", "Nta- you told him you wanted the ring. Yes you showed that you liked the birks but you literally said to him you wanted to pick them out for yourself. You\u2019re not a brat bc your husband can\u2019t listen to your very clear instructions", "NTA sandals are not an anniversary gift, especially when you had agreed on a ring", "YTA. I'm confused because at the beginning you said you weren't expecting anything and that you're both too busy for such things. Then you are unhappy because the gift he got wasn't good enough? Even though he noticed how much you liked the shoes, remembered, and went and got them for you as a surprise? I would be really touched if my partner did that for me. You sound  pretty ungrateful...", "maybe he took into consideration that you're an indecisive shopper and thought it would be easier to make that decision for you in the form of a thoughtful gift. he knew you didn't *not like* them so figured it was a good choice. is he not typical a 'good' gift giver? i know it's something not everyone is stellar at. plus, maybe he needed to get something that he could get quicker and not have to order? eta: sorry, yta. he got you a thoughtful gift regardless and your lack of gratefulness isn't cool.", "YTA, he remembered something you liked and went and bought it for you. That's not \"low effort\" that's the definition of a thoughtful gift.\n\nWhat exactly did you get HIM for your anniversary...", "yta - thats not a low effort gift.  he paid attn to how u liked them and thought well ill go surprise her and buy them.  admit it:  your upset becuase u got the birkenstocks instead of the updated ring you wanted.", "Info: what did you get for him? \nAlso, you can\u2019t say that you weren\u2019t expected a gift but also mad he didn\u2019t get you a ring.", "Well congratulations!  You\u2019ve just assured that he never puts any thought into your gifts again. He will only consider the exact item you tell him to get for you. You\u2019ve gone from low effort to no effort gifts. I hope you are happy now.\n\nYTA and have only succeeded in screwing yourself.", "YTA", "YTA. Maybe he didn\u2019t want to give you an inexpensive ring as an upgrade. I find it interesting that you find the Birks a low effort gift when you sent him links to the ring you like, which would have taken minimal effort to purchase. He at least tried to do something thoughtful that showed he was listening. You sound like you overthink big purchases, isn\u2019t it possible that he realized you liked an expensive pair of shoes and decided to purchase it for you in case you talked yourself out of the big purchase?? I just don\u2019t understand why you jumped to the worst conclusion for your husbands action. Sure as shit doesn\u2019t provide motivation for surprise gifts in the future.", "YTA. I love it when my partner does this for me. Love it because it means he is attuned n cares abt me.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s low effort but I would suggest to him that he buy you a gift card in the future since you like to do research. This doesn\u2019t need to be huge but I can see the disappointment on each end. He feels like he can\u2019t do anything right and you are unsatisfied with the gift. Also Birkenstocks are addicting welcome to the club", "NTA. Accept the gift and re-gift this pair", "NTA, instead of low effort, I see it as low attention, unclear on the concept of a thoughtful gift. Not paying attention.  question - does he have ADHD? This reminds me of, with all respect, an ADHD story.", "Yeahh\u2026 OP isn\u2019t the asshole. OP husband was informed and confirmed what OP wanted for their anniversary. OPs husband bought the shoes the day of. \n\nNow, if OPs husband bought the Birkenstocks prior to OP showing interest, then OP would be ungrateful. But the husband was just lazy about it, personally.", "NTA. It was a low-effort gift. Nothing kills marriages faster than spouses who don\u2019t listen to their partners. Well\u2026cheating, ig could. And murder. But the next fastest are spouses who feel unheard, unseen, and unloved.", "YTA like ma'am what? Low effort? Compared to you're no effort I'd say you're being rude", "NTA. I genuinely don't get people who aren't thrilled at the opportunity to buy their loved ones gifts that show how much you've been thinking of them and, by extension, how much they matter to you and how grateful you are to have them around. I hoard details and information about my partner like found pennies, saving the details up for the next gift occasion, and while I probably wouldn't do the ring as an anniversary gift, either (probably because I'd have already done it as a \"just because\"), what she receives will almost certainly be related to an offhand comment from six months ago about her favorite childhood book or a game she mentioned wanting to try, or tickets to an event that she didn't know was happening that I know will leave her grinning for a week after. Man, finding the perfect gift is so much fun? I don't understand people who choose not to.", "NTA. Nothing is more depressing than getting a gift from someone \"close\" that tells you the giver knows nothing about you and can't hear the words that come out of your mouth.", "NTA. If I got birckenstocks for my ELEVEN YEAR anniversary after that exchange you two had I\u2019d be fuckin pissed. Hell, call me ungrateful, but my bf got me a whole ass cat for my birthday. He brought home the cat a couple days before my birthday though, and I didn\u2019t get anything on my actual birthday. I wasn\u2019t expecting another gift or anything but a card and some flowers would have been nice\u2026.but I was still bummed he didn\u2019t get me a card\u2026(I\u2019m really into cards and messages of love and yes he knows how important it is to me). My point is, I may be a spoiled little brat but guess what? We\u2019re allowed to be disappointed when we don\u2019t get what we want and what we\u2019ve made clear that we want. Doesn\u2019t make you ungrateful.", "i want to know this too. i figure maybe he didn't have time to order and have it shipped?", "He could have gotten her the ring she asked for.", "Came here to say this. It\u2019s not \u201clow effort\u201d. He noticed something you liked, found time to sneak out and buy it. That\u2019s the opposite of low effort. YTA and rude as hell.", "She wasn't \"weirdly upset\", he was. She didn't know which ones she wanted, he bought the ones she wasn't sure about. Now she wants to exchange them and he's mad. She feels \"some kind of way\" because he is mad at her.", "Agreed. People on this post really showing they couldn't care less about their loved ones wants or listening to them at all. NTA.", "Exactly. I don\u2019t think that most people understand the concept of what a gift is. If my wife says that she want a specific thing, then it\u2019s not a gift, thats an errand. \u201cHey honey, here\u2019s a link to this thing that I want you to buy with money from our joint bank account for me and I\u2019ll pretend that I\u2019m surprised and appreciative when you give it to me, but if you get me something different then you\u2019ll be sleeping on the couch. Oh and by the way, since we have a history of not giving gifts, you won\u2019t be getting anything from me.\u201d", "Not to make an anniversary transactional, but... did OP put in the thought and effort for him that she wanted for herself? I'm very curious.", "Then he should at least have given her something she really likes/wants.\n\nSure, the ring could have been too expensive. But OP clearly communicated that she didn't want the shoes that he got (it's why she didn't buy them). It's not about the ring, it's about the lack of consideration towards OP. \n\nNo gift would have been better than the one she got.", "Telling women they need to communicate more / better is often just a smokescreen. It\u2019s a way to deflect blame onto her instead of onto a man for failing to give a crap. But then when she does communicate clearly, the goalposts shift to blaming her for having unreasonable expectations. Then we wonder why so many women put up with less than the bare minimum in relationships with men.", "You may have apologized. BUT bring up this topic another time and without apologizing, describe to your husband how you felt (after you spelled out wanting an inexpensive ring and sending him a picture/website link) - that even after specifying what you would like, he didn\u2019t BOTHER with all of your thought process and then got offended that you weren\u2019t grateful for something you weren\u2019t sure about.\n\nSpeak up now or this drama of him getting offended at HIS half-hearted and stubborn attempts of gift-giving is going to repeat itself forever over years.\n\nNTA", "NTA but also try seeing it from your husbands side, yes you agreed on it and told him. But I would see me getting my wife something she specifically pointed out to me a \u201clow effort gift\u201d and try to do something more thoughtful. At 11 years he should know you by now though. He shouldn\u2019t be upset you didn\u2019t like the gift. Cut him some slack but definitely communicate how this made you feel so he knows even though he might feel it\u2019s low effort it\u2019s what you would prefer. Hope you sort this out. And happy anniversary! January will be 8 for us.", "Nah Simple communication could\u2019ve been good. \u2018I got you the ring but it\u2019ll take xyz\u2019", "Grandma here but I like Tetris and Dr Mario before becoming a grandma. I don\u2019t have the dexterity to play anything else", "Why are grandmas so obsessed with Tetris. When mine was alive she would literally stay up all night (in her 70s!) playing goddamn Tetris", "ALLLL of this. Exactly.", "Its manipulation", "It wasn't said that he asked her \"so you want this for your anniversary gift?\" He just verified that that's something that she wants maybe he's budgeting for it or something. It's not said that he refuses to get it for her", "Gifts aren't transactional like that...it's the thought that counts. Just because you don't get the gift you asked for doesn't mean you shouldnt be grateful for the thought and effort that went into the gift ?", "You're right. It's not low effort. It's indifference to what she actually wants. He ignored what she actually wanted **after agreeing to buy it**, ignored that she wasn't ready to buy that pair and wanted to do more research. And now he's sulking that she's not excited that he doesn't pay attention to what she says and thinks.", "She literally sent the link wtf", "This confused me too.", "Sounds like \"no gift\" is what she got him.  That's why my vote is YTA.", "I swear, sometimes folks take the direction my brain was blowing me and have already built the vision I couldn't see. Yep, this, 100% this - the bar is on the sub-basement floor and folks're digging to Hell", "Tetris improves existing PTSD and can reduce the likelihood of developing it in the first place if you play it immediately after a traumatic event. They hadn't quite done the research yet but I'm pretty sure that's why my grandma was so obsessed.", "In relationships, if you tell someone you are going to do something for them, it is rude and hurtful not to do that thing.  It seems like his 'thought' was that he forgot to buy her the ring or he broke his promise to buy the ring.  If he didn't want to get the ring for whatever reason he should have told her before hand.  Some people really like to be surprised by gifts, but some are happier with guided gift giving.  And by any measure shoes are not as romantic of a gift as a ring.", "No thought went into this though.  It's not like he bought them for her with out her having tried them on. Or he bought them for her because she had achy feet. He bought them after he saw her try them on. She wasn't even sure those were the ones she  wanted.", "Funny OP cooked breakfast, seems low effort."]}
