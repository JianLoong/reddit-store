A few months ago my husband mentioned needing a new wallet. I bought him one as our anniversary gift. In my mind, that\u2019s thoughtful.

I know you said you needed to think about it, but he may have thought it was due to the price and he wanted to take that burden of considering cost away from you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for wanting to return the gift since you hadn\u2019t made up your mind on the shoes yet, but I do think you\u2019re an asshole for calling his gift \u201clow effort\u201d.", "YTA.

How could you think that you're not the AH?? You picked them out. Said you liked them. Didn't purchase because of anxiety over price. Husband listened. Paid attention to which specific shoe you chose. Cut the anxiety of price comparing for you. Went back and purchased said item THAT YOU LIKED. And you're upset.

It wasnt what i wanted sooooo it\u2019s low effort.", "YTA your extremely ungrateful i was expexting you to say he got you some leggings or something when you said 'low effort' that was quite observant of him not many husbands would do that", "YTA yikes", "YTA. That is not a low effort gift. That is your husband listening and seeing how happy you were when you tried them on. And maybe he didn\u2019t understand that you wanted to do more research into other types but he probably also knows you\u2019re less likely to spend a bunch on yourself. I have a husband who does this sometimes. Your husband did something nice and you should be grateful.", "YTA how is that low effort? he remembered that you really liked something but wouldn't get it for yourself and went back and got it for you. \n\nalso why do people think they can dictate what gift is given to them? a \"gift\" is supposed to be a voluntary way of showing appreciation to someone, it should not be an obligation. just be grateful.", "ESH\n\nYou are an AH for characterizing his gifts as low effort.  He made the effort to remember something you like and make a special trip to the mall to get it.  That puts him ahead of 75% of the partners I know. It would serve you well to show as much appreciation as you can muster for his efforts. \n\nHowever, he's an AH for two reasons.  Firstly, he did not pay attention to what you said, i.e., that you weren't actually sure that you liked them. Or if he did pay attention, he ignored or discounted you. Secondly, he's mad at you for not wanting to keep shoes that are wrong for you. Shoes have to be right, or they become a waste of space and money. At age 37, he should know that.", "YTA. I'd be freaking happy with a new pair of shoes rather than an updated ring. What's wrong with the ring? Also I wouldn't consider birkenstocks low effort, they're not cheap by any means.

After five years of some friendships, I know how my friends deliberate or decide things, not to mention someone I'm in partnership with. While DH did get a gift, he went out at the last minute to get something that OP had said needed more decision time, after having agreed to get OP what was specifically asked for, linked, and discussed. A lot of the YTA seem to be \"be grateful that he did anything\" which seems like an exceedingly low bar, while the NTA seem to be that OP communicated and DH reneged on what was agreed upon.

Mine is struggling more, so I'm looking to upgrade and look for one that can do some extras.  \n**Dad**: \\*buys a random, though at least same brand as the old one, sewing machine without any input from mum (or even me) and without doing any research into what it can and can't do. \n\nHe did this with a lot of stuff, buying things that are close to what mum said, but never exactly what she wants / needs. It is a very annoying: you have something you don't want or can't use for what you specifically need, and you cannot show your annoyance because dad might (and will!) feel insulted. \n\nSame with jewelry.  \nDad: mum likes purple.  \nMe: yes, but that's specific item is not mum's style. It's too small and too close to her neck.  \nDad: I can buy whatever I want for my wife  \nMe: she is not going to wear it  \nDad: I beg the differ, I know mum  \nApparently he didn't because guess what piece of jewelry she never wore and after a couple of years has been secretly given to one of my cousins...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe thing is, it is just lazy work of my dad. Because if he really listened to my mum, he would know exactly what mum wants. He just needs to pay attention and not just half-listen. It's the same with OP's husband. \n\nOther example that really happened: when my sibling and I were a lot younger, we wanted a Gameboy for Christmas (and birthdays combined) we begged and even suggested Dad that grandparents, godparents, any other family that wanted to give us a present, should just donate for a Gameboy (we had saved some money to buy a game once we had it)... if he thought it was too expensive. You know what we got? A handheld gamecomputer that can only play 3 forms of tetris. It s\\*cks when you communicate very clearly and ask for \\[Item A\\] and you get \\[Item a'\\].
