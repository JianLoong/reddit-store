Despite us constantly fighting growing up we were less than a year apart in age and were honestly always best friends.\n\nAnyway, due to life circumstances we live a few towns apart, now. My sister recently met a man at her church who is just out of prison. He is a convicted felon who once sold meth.\n\nMy sister insists that he is a reformed man and last week invited our mother and me to come out to her town and meet him. I refused and so did our mom. I can't fully speak for our mother--although I know that this is also her reasoning based on our conversations--but we refused because of his criminal past. This is a man who was once fully willing to destroy people's lives and possibly cause death just to make a quick, easy buck. I have absolutely NO respect for such a man and it shocks me that my sister would give such a person her love and support.\n\nMy sister is furious with me and our mother. She says that her boyfriend did his time, is remorseful, and deserves a second chance. I told her that if he can maintain a clean, honest lifestyle for the next two years that I will meet him and will encourage our mother to do the same. But that until he can prove himself he's basically a piece of garbage to me. Am I being too demanding and putting too long a time limit on it?

She met him in church? Oh lord) , you DO need to meet him, because your sister is doubling down on him being the love of her life or whatnot.\n\nBasically, if you meet him you are showing this guy that your sister has a family and support. \n\nSo if he really is sketchy and has bad intentions, he\u2019ll hopefully be scared off by her support system. See, by cutting off contact with her you\u2019d be playing into his hands - that\u2019s the first thing abusers do, separate any victim from their family.\n\nIf he is a reformed soul, well then you\u2019ll have met your sister\u2019s new boyfriend. There\u2019s no downside here. \n\nMaking a stand is just empty talk - see what she really needs and support her in that.", "YTA\n\nNot specifically because you didn\u2019t want to meet him, but for not trusting the judgement of your sister and best friend. \n\nYou are making your mind up based on nothing but your own preconceptions of who he was and is. The ridiculous time limit is evidence of this. \n\nWhat\u2019s the harm in going out to meet him, maybe learn a little about him and his past? If he\u2019s reformed as she says, it will be easy as he should be pretty open about it. It\u2019s very easy to sit in a proverbial ivory tower and judge someone for their past, but until you know how they ended up on that path you have little foundation to base that judgement on.", "NTA. Yes he\u2019s served his time. But if he\u2019s \u201cjust out of prison\u201d, he needs time to show he can build a life outside of crime and the destruction of drugs. I would be hesitant to meet someone so freshly out of incarceration. In the us, the criminal justice system focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation. Recidivism is real. [\u201cOver two-thirds (76.9%) of state drug offenders released from state prison were rearrested within five years, compared to 41.9% of federal drug trafficking offenders released from prison over the same five-year period](https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/recidivism-among-federal-drug-trafficking-offenders).\u201d I would be cautious at first. Especially as many people claim to be \u201cborn again\u201d to excuse their criminal past and as she met him in church, this seems likely. It doesn\u2019t erase the harm they caused. I would need more time than \u201cjust out of prison\u201d, especially for such a harmful charge that sent him there. Two years seems like a very long time though", "I'd say YTA for mutiple reasons.\n\n1. Judging someone on their past. people change and grow, dealing drugs isn't the end-all-horrible-scarface moment D.A.R.E and other programs make it out to be (they lie) like do you even know the extent of his drug dealings? was he simply a weed dealer who pushed up to make ends meet? was he a gang member? did he sell laced product? or was he somehow society ignored & was shunned by society/ignored & pushed into a direction you don't like? \n2. if you think he's so terrible then you should 10x as much BE THERE for your sister. make sure she's safe. if you isolate her - and if he IS abusive. it makes it 100x easier for her to manipulate her, \"look how easily your family abandoned you, no one will love you the way I do\" yada yada. \n3. the audacity to give a time limit for someone else's relationship to be \"good enough\" for you is so friggen obnoxious and stupid. by the time he's \"good enough\" for you do you think either of them will GROVEL at your feet begging for your approval? tough luck if they would even want to talk to you at that point. I know I wouldn't.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t being asked to date the guy, you\u2019re being asked to meet him and be civil. This is someone your sister cares about, and you are making your judgment about him without even meeting him.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable not to want to meet convicted felons and drug dealers.\n\nI would point out that if you posted \"I'm refusing to meet my sister's new boyfriend because he used the n-word three years ago,\" everyone here would say you're not the a-hole.", "YTA.  Love how you are already judging him and have preconceived notions about him without even saying hello.   You have no reason as to why he was selling drugs, it's not always for a \"quick, easy buck\".  \n\nFrankly, your sister sounds better off without you in her life for the next 2 years", "Geez. Your tone is so judge-y and emphatic that I want to say y.t.a. I mean, do you know anything about the guy or what the circumstances were? You say very definitively that he knowingly and intentionally hurt people, but that's not a certainty. People, particularly if they are young and under significant economic or emotional pressure, can twist themselves to justify lots of bad behavior. Hell think about all the doctors who took kickbacks while over prescribing options. I doubt you'd be making the same fuss if she brought one of those guys home.\n\nPlus, if he is a bad guy you are just further isolating your sister and making it more difficult for her to see that about him. Meeting him, remaining curious, understanding how he treats her and others is a better tactic.\n\nAll that said, I don't think you should be required by the rules of non-assholery to go to dinner with anyone. So my judgment is NAH even though I think you probably are being a bit of a judge AH.", "NTA. \n\nNot at all.", "\u2026.NTA, but wow am I judging commenters. \u201cStep right up folks and meet the meth drug dealer right out of prison\u201d.  Do people not see the news??  Every day dirtbags fresh out of prison meet innocent women that later up as their victims, whether abused or dead. If this WAS your child would you be so quick to suggest \u201cthey just need a second chance\u201d.  I agree that the person served his time, but it\u2019s remarkable how quickly they meet someone fresh out of prison.  \n\nPlease send me your downvotes so I can see how trustingly stupid many commenters are. I will relish them.", "YTA - people change and the purpose of prison is to rehabilitate and well as incarcerate. Many people have been to prison for things and have left and become respectable people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf your sister brought home Robert Downey Jr would you be the same? He went to prison for drug related things too.", "YTA. This guy doesn't owe you anything. He has done his time and deserves a second chance.", "I feel like the divide in the comments has nothing to do with your actions and everything to do with people's take on the guy.\n\nImpersonally I think pretty much NTA because he did something you found morally objectionable to the extreme and don't think there's any coming back from. You don't owe anyone forgiveness and your sister picking someone as a partner doesn't mandate you liking or even accepting them.\n\nPersonally, I definitely agree with that take. We in the comments don't know to what extent he dealt but the hard fact is he was a provider of one of the most life ruining drugs in existence and no matter how responsibly he was dealing (which is a stretch of the term responsible) he still was putting that out there. He can say he's sorry after a prison sentence and say he's reformed but I'm with you, unless you stay clean for a long while I have no reason to believe you.", "YTA- the man did his time and is allowed a second chance. It\u2019s completely rational to be skeptical and be careful at first around them but they deserve a chance. You also have no idea what this persons upbringing or home life or anything else was like so you have no idea what caused them to turn to selling drugs. There are some people who do it just to make a quick buck and don\u2019t care who it hurts. There are also people who do it because it\u2019s the only way to keep food on their table and the lights on.", "NTA. IMO, you made a reasonable deal with her even though you worded it harshly. I've known way too many drug dealers and users here in my country who've been in and out of prisons, have promised to change to their families, and then go back spiraling down that hellhole after a few months of being \"clean\" despite going through rehab, therapy, and counseling.\n\nThe people here who think he deserves a chance this very early in his \"recovery\" have probably never had a drug addict in their life. Experiencing the relapse, the lies, and the heartbreak that may or may not be waiting for her is her choice to make.", "NTA don't come to Reddit for things like this, the judgments are going to be from people with superiority complexes that have no interaction with the outside world or how it works lol", "You & your Mom are free to make your own decisions however I can\u2019t imagine your sister will be thrilled with your complete lack of trust of her & of loyalty to each other as siblings. \n\nYour sister asked you to meet this man. That\u2019s why you should do it because you respect your sister. The man has nothing to do with her request. \n\nYTA", "N T A. You could have said it in a less aggressive way, but I see where you're coming from.  He's fresh out of prison, and unfortunately, that time period is where they usually get caught up in old habits.", "NTA. She is walking into a situation just waiting to explode. Hope she doesn't have the data needed to steal your or your mother's identity. It's easier than people think, and I wouldn't trust that man one iota.", "YTA\n\nYou trust your sister and find out with her, or you don\u2019t. \n\nAlso, \u2018every sinner has a future, and every saint has a past.\u2019 Judgmental much or is this a first?", "NTA\n\nTwo years seems reasonable.

Have you heard of these films in something called the MCU?", "While it\u2019s true that the American prison system does not have a broad rehab component, many individual prisons do have things like animal therapy or creative writing classes that are explicitly intended to help inmates redirect their lives so they can be functional members of society when their time is done. They have to WANT to change, of course, and there are plenty of people who only pretend to change, but there\u2019s no way to know unless OP meets him.\n\nI am worried about the FRESH-out-of-prison aspect, mostly because newly released people do need some transition time sort of like newly-clean addicts do, but OP didn\u2019t say exactly how long the guy has been out. Fresh could mean 2 weeks, 2 months or a year."]}
