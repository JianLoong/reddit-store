Despite us constantly fighting growing up we were less than a year apart in age and were honestly always best friends.\n\nAnyway, due to life circumstances we live a few towns apart, now. My sister recently met a man at her church who is just out of prison. He is a convicted felon who once sold meth.\n\nMy sister insists that he is a reformed man and last week invited our mother and me to come out to her town and meet him. I refused and so did our mom. I can't fully speak for our mother--although I know that this is also her reasoning based on our conversations--but we refused because of his criminal past. This is a man who was once fully willing to destroy people's lives and possibly cause death just to make a quick, easy buck. I have absolutely NO respect for such a man and it shocks me that my sister would give such a person her love and support.\n\nMy sister is furious with me and our mother. She says that her boyfriend did his time, is remorseful, and deserves a second chance. I told her that if he can maintain a clean, honest lifestyle for the next two years that I will meet him and will encourage our mother to do the same. But that until he can prove himself he's basically a piece of garbage to me. Am I being too demanding and putting too long a time limit on it?

She met him in church? Oh lord) , you DO need to meet him, because your sister is doubling down on him being the love of her life or whatnot.\n\nBasically, if you meet him you are showing this guy that your sister has a family and support. \n\nSo if he really is sketchy and has bad intentions, he\u2019ll hopefully be scared off by her support system. See, by cutting off contact with her you\u2019d be playing into his hands - that\u2019s the first thing abusers do, separate any victim from their family.\n\nIf he is a reformed soul, well then you\u2019ll have met your sister\u2019s new boyfriend. There\u2019s no downside here. \n\nMaking a stand is just empty talk - see what she really needs and support her in that.", "YTA\n\nNot specifically because you didn\u2019t want to meet him, but for not trusting the judgement of your sister and best friend. \n\nYou are making your mind up based on nothing but your own preconceptions of who he was and is. The ridiculous time limit is evidence of this. \n\nWhat\u2019s the harm in going out to meet him, maybe learn a little about him and his past? If he\u2019s reformed as she says, it will be easy as he should be pretty open about it. It\u2019s very easy to sit in a proverbial ivory tower and judge someone for their past, but until you know how they ended up on that path you have little foundation to base that judgement on.", "NTA. Yes he\u2019s served his time. But if he\u2019s \u201cjust out of prison\u201d, he needs time to show he can build a life outside of crime and the destruction of drugs. I would be hesitant to meet someone so freshly out of incarceration. In the us, the criminal justice system focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation. Recidivism is real. [\u201cOver two-thirds (76.9%) of state drug offenders released from state prison were rearrested within five years, compared to 41.9% of federal drug trafficking offenders released from prison over the same five-year period](https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/recidivism-among-federal-drug-trafficking-offenders).\u201d I would be cautious at first. Especially as many people claim to be \u201cborn again\u201d to excuse their criminal past and as she met him in church, this seems likely. It doesn\u2019t erase the harm they caused. I would need more time than \u201cjust out of prison\u201d, especially for such a harmful charge that sent him there. Two years seems like a very long time though", "I'd say YTA for mutiple reasons.\n\n1. Judging someone on their past. people change and grow, dealing drugs isn't the end-all-horrible-scarface moment D.A.R.E and other programs make it out to be (they lie) like do you even know the extent of his drug dealings? was he simply a weed dealer who pushed up to make ends meet? was he a gang member? did he sell laced product? or was he somehow society ignored & was shunned by society/ignored & pushed into a direction you don't like? \n2. if you think he's so terrible then you should 10x as much BE THERE for your sister. make sure she's safe. if you isolate her - and if he IS abusive. it makes it 100x easier for her to manipulate her, \"look how easily your family abandoned you, no one will love you the way I do\" yada yada. \n3. the audacity to give a time limit for someone else's relationship to be \"good enough\" for you is so friggen obnoxious and stupid. by the time he's \"good enough\" for you do you think either of them will GROVEL at your feet begging for your approval? tough luck if they would even want to talk to you at that point. I know I wouldn't.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t being asked to date the guy, you\u2019re being asked to meet him and be civil. This is someone your sister cares about, and you are making your judgment about him without even meeting him.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable not to want to meet convicted felons and drug dealers.\n\nI would point out that if you posted \"I'm refusing to meet my sister's new boyfriend because he used the n-word three years ago,\" everyone here would say you're not the a-hole.", "YTA.  Love how you are already judging him and have preconceived notions about him without even saying hello.   You have no reason as to why he was selling drugs, it's not always for a \"quick, easy buck\".  \n\nFrankly, your sister sounds better off without you in her life for the next 2 years", "Geez. Your tone is so judge-y and emphatic that I want to say y.t.a. I mean, do you know anything about the guy or what the circumstances were? You say very definitively that he knowingly and intentionally hurt people, but that's not a certainty. People, particularly if they are young and under significant economic or emotional pressure, can twist themselves to justify lots of bad behavior. Hell think about all the doctors who took kickbacks while over prescribing opiods. I doubt you'd be making the same fuss if she brought one of those guys home.\n\nPlus, if he is a bad guy you are just further isolating your sister and making it more difficult for her to see that about him. Meeting him, remaining curious, understanding how he treats her and others is a better tactic.\n\nAll that said, I don't think you should be required by the rules of non-assholery to go to dinner with anyone. So my judgment is NAH even though I think you probably are being a bit of a judge AH.", "NTA. \n\nNot at all.", "\u2026.NTA, but wow am I judging commenters. \u201cStep right up folks and meet the meth drug dealer right out of prison\u201d.

He has done his time and deserves a second chance.", "I feel like the divide in the comments has nothing to do with your actions and everything to do with people's take on the guy.\n\nImpersonally I think pretty much NTA because he did something you found morally objectionable to the extreme and don't think there's any coming back from. You don't owe anyone forgiveness and your sister picking someone as a partner doesn't mandate you liking or even accepting them.\n\nPersonally, I definitely agree with that take. We in the comments don't know to what extent he dealt but the hard fact is he was a provider of one of the most life ruining drugs in existence and no matter how responsibly he was dealing (which is a stretch of the term responsible) he still was putting that out there. He can say he's sorry after a prison sentence and say he's reformed but I'm with you, unless you stay clean for a long while I have no reason to believe you.", "YTA- the man did his time and is allowed a second chance. It\u2019s completely rational to be skeptical and be careful at first around them but they deserve a chance. You also have no idea what this persons upbringing or home life or anything else was like so you have no idea what caused them to turn to selling drugs. There are some people who do it just to make a quick buck and don\u2019t care who it hurts. There are also people who do it because it\u2019s the only way to keep food on their table and the lights on.", "NTA. IMO, you made a reasonable deal with her even though you worded it harshly. I've known way too many drug dealers and users here in my country who've been in and out of prisons, have promised to change to their families, and then go back spiraling down that hellhole after a few months of being \"clean\" despite going through rehab, therapy, and counseling.\n\nThe people here who think he deserves a chance this very early in his \"recovery\" have probably never had a drug addict in their life.

I am going with YTA.\n\nI have a friend who is an addict. He is my best friend of nearly 20 years. We have seen and gone through everything together and lived together twice and it was the second that he became an addict. His behavior had completed changed to the point I couldn\u2019t even recognize him and after two years I kicked him out. It was a clean move, no drama and no anything, he tried but I nipped it the bud. It became better for him and after a year he has finally started going into a professional setting and is turning his life back around and has become the person I knew and we remain best friends.\n\nMy point is that yes you are right, dealers do taken advantage for selfish reasons. But prisons are meant to be the punishment, and they should also be the source of rehabilitation as well. Granted not here in America. But, you didn\u2019t know this guy when he was a dealer and you\u2019re not making an effort to know him now. Who knows what he is like and what steps he is been taking to make reparations in ways that he can. Will it undue the damage that was done to others? No, nothing can. Can anyone fix every single big and small mistake they made whether the after effects were singular or multiple? No. \n\nIf you want someone to fix their behavior and then punish them for their attempts then you are enabling them to go back to the bad behavior because you\u2019re showing them that nothing matters so why not be the thing you treat them to be.

None of his confiscated supply contained fentinyl. Those factors lead to a lighter sentence in a minimum security place. He served his time, and he got clean again while he was in.

And then he might question at some time \"why bother\" if there is no way back to a life outside crime. \n3. He was in prison. His debt to Society is paid. Dealing drugs is not a medical condition, it is not like he will have violent outbursts at people or something. If you do not think that prison is enough, you should vote on legislation to put drug dealer on death row or something like that (that is the consequence if there is no redemption, or life in prison, right?) \n4.

This idea that once you been been charged with a crime you're forever a criminal only makes it harder to reintegrate people into society. \n\nTo be clear I'm in no way suggesting we blindly trust everyone getting out of prison but if we can't give them a chance why even let them out in the first place?  It took me a while to gain back trust, even from people that loved me the most. It's because of having that chance that if you got to know me today you'd be surprised to learn I'm a convicted felon.  \n\nOne last comment concerning everyone bringing up concerns of abuse.

When it comes to addicts/dealers etc. you keep them at arms length and give them a wide berth.  This is what my family has had to do.  Simply agreeing to casually meet someone as a subtle way to let them know their loved one has a support system, while making sure she understands you have her back,  does not equate letting this person into your life and to the point they are in your home robbing you blindly and bringing violence to your household.

However, \nI have seen both sides. \n\nOne is my mother, who went from one relationship to another druggie, alcoholic, felons are her guys/husband's of choice. NC for 25 years, then about 5 years ago, I once allowed her in my life to get clean. She needed help and was husband free, and for six months, she did not do drugs, and I thought she doing was doing well. After Six months sober, one day, she decided she needed a drink, then proceeded to pop a tire on my SUV as she almost ran up the curb at school pick up and then tried to drive my kids drunk in my car.  I had to meet her at the school and had to call someone to fix the tire. Then I smelled the alcohol on her breath as she had been standing away from me as I was dealing with the tire, etc. A bunch of other dramas ensued, but this is why she is NC again and out of our lives.\n\nOn the flip side, I have another family member who had been on drugs for 20 years, sold drugs, did meth, lived on the streets from time to time, dumpster dived for food because getting high was his thing to do. He quit cold turkey one day, and he has been sober over 7 years. I was skeptical at first, but over time, I was glad he proved me wrong. Paid his fines and dues, got his license back, and got a good paying job after staying sober for years. He is doing amazing and has a support system in place, including me. He also has a wonderful family now.\n\nMy point is that while it's tough to think about what new bf has done in the past - you and your mom separating your sister from her family,  is dumb, potentially dangerous an gives a possible abuser carte blache to start abusing (doesnt need to be physical). Right now, the relationship is new. He is sober and trying. Some people really do want second chances, and a good support system goes a long way even if you can only support your sister now. I hope that is the case for your sister sake.\n\nMy advice is to be safe, be cautious, and encourage your sister to stay close to you. At best, he really wants a new life at worse it can go bad for your sister.

It's not cute like Breaking Bad.", "While it might not be true, it rings true -- if that makes sense. \n\nKnowing several people that escaped abusive relationships -- it was always the outside support that helped them first realize the issues and made them feel safe enough to leave. It's why abusers try so hard to isolate their victims, because then they can start crafting an uncontested reality for victim that suits the whims of the abuser.
