Despite us constantly fighting growing up we were less than a year apart in age and were honestly always best friends.\n\nAnyway, due to life circumstances we live a few towns apart, now. My sister recently met a man at her church who is just out of prison. He is a convicted felon who once sold meth.\n\nMy sister insists that he is a reformed man and last week invited our mother and me to come out to her town and meet him. I refused and so did our mom. I can't fully speak for our mother--although I know that this is also her reasoning based on our conversations--but we refused because of his criminal past. This is a man who was once fully willing to destroy people's lives and possibly cause death just to make a quick, easy buck. I have absolutely NO respect for such a man and it shocks me that my sister would give such a person her love and support.\n\nMy sister is furious with me and our mother. She says that her boyfriend did his time, is remorseful, and deserves a second chance. I told her that if he can maintain a clean, honest lifestyle for the next two years that I will meet him and will encourage our mother to do the same. But that until he can prove himself he's basically a piece of garbage to me. Am I being too demanding and putting too long a time limit on it?

She met him in church? Oh lord) , you DO need to meet him, because your sister is doubling down on him being the love of her life or whatnot.\n\nBasically, if you meet him you are showing this guy that your sister has a family and support. \n\nSo if he really is sketchy and has bad intentions, he\u2019ll hopefully be scared off by her support system. See, by cutting off contact with her you\u2019d be playing into his hands - that\u2019s the first thing abusers do, separate any victim from their family.\n\nIf he is a reformed soul, well then you\u2019ll have met your sister\u2019s new boyfriend. There\u2019s no downside here. \n\nMaking a stand is just empty talk - see what she really needs and support her in that.", "YTA\n\nNot specifically because you didn\u2019t want to meet him, but for not trusting the judgement of your sister and best friend. \n\nYou are making your mind up based on nothing but your own preconceptions of who he was and is. The ridiculous time limit is evidence of this. \n\nWhat\u2019s the harm in going out to meet him, maybe learn a little about him and his past? If he\u2019s reformed as she says, it will be easy as he should be pretty open about it. It\u2019s very easy to sit in a proverbial ivory tower and judge someone for their past, but until you know how they ended up on that path you have little foundation to base that judgement on.", "NTA. Yes he\u2019s served his time. But if he\u2019s \u201cjust out of prison\u201d, he needs time to show he can build a life outside of crime and the destruction of drugs. I would be hesitant to meet someone so freshly out of incarceration. In the us, the criminal justice system focuses on punishment rather than rehabilitation. Recidivism is real. [\u201cOver two-thirds (76.9%) of state drug offenders released from state prison were rearrested within five years, compared to 41.9% of federal drug trafficking offenders released from prison over the same five-year period](https://www.ussc.gov/research/research-reports/recidivism-among-federal-drug-trafficking-offenders).\u201d I would be cautious at first. Especially as many people claim to be \u201cborn again\u201d to excuse their criminal past and as she met him in church, this seems likely. It doesn\u2019t erase the harm they caused. I would need more time than \u201cjust out of prison\u201d, especially for such a harmful charge that sent him there. Two years seems like a very long time though", "I'd say YTA for mutiple reasons.\n\n1. Judging someone on their past. people change and grow, dealing drugs isn't the end-all-horrible-scarface moment D.A.R.E and other programs make it out to be (they lie) like do you even know the extent of his drug dealings? was he simply a weed dealer who pushed up to make ends meet? was he a gang member? did he sell laced product? or was he somehow society ignored & was shunned by society/ignored & pushed into a direction you don't like? \n2. if you think he's so terrible then you should 10x as much BE THERE for your sister. make sure she's safe. if you isolate her - and if he IS abusive. it makes it 100x easier for her to manipulate her, \"look how easily your family abandoned you, no one will love you the way I do\" yada yada. \n3. the audacity to give a time limit for someone else's relationship to be \"good enough\" for you is so friggen obnoxious and stupid. by the time he's \"good enough\" for you do you think either of them will GROVEL at your feet begging for your approval? tough luck if they would even want to talk to you at that point. I know I wouldn't.", "YTA. You aren\u2019t being asked to date the guy, you\u2019re being asked to meet him and be civil. This is someone your sister cares about, and you are making your judgment about him without even meeting him.", "NTA. It's perfectly reasonable not to want to meet convicted felons and drug dealers.\n\nI would point out that if you posted \"I'm refusing to meet my sister's new boyfriend because he used the n-word three years ago,\" everyone here would say you're not the a-hole.", "YTA.  Love how you are already judging him and have preconceived notions about him without even saying hello.   You have no reason as to why he was selling drugs, it's not always for a \"quick, easy buck\".  \n\nFrankly, your sister sounds better off without you in her life for the next 2 years", "Geez. Your tone is so judge-y and emphatic that I want to say y.t.a. I mean, do you know anything about the guy or what the circumstances were? You say very definitively that he knowingly and intentionally hurt people, but that's not a certainty. People, particularly if they are young and under significant economic or emotional pressure, can twist themselves to justify lots of bad behavior. Hell think about all the doctors who took kickbacks while over prescribing opiods. I doubt you'd be making the same fuss if she brought one of those guys home.\n\nPlus, if he is a bad guy you are just further isolating your sister and making it more difficult for her to see that about him. Meeting him, remaining curious, understanding how he treats her and others is a better tactic.\n\nAll that said, I don't think you should be required by the rules of non-assholery to go to dinner with anyone. So my judgment is NAH even though I think you probably are being a bit of a judge AH.", "NTA. \n\nNot at all.", "\u2026.NTA, but wow am I judging commenters. \u201cStep right up folks and meet the meth drug dealer right out of prison\u201d.

He has done his time and deserves a second chance.", "I feel like the divide in the comments has nothing to do with your actions and everything to do with people's take on the guy.\n\nImpersonally I think pretty much NTA because he did something you found morally objectionable to the extreme and don't think there's any coming back from. You don't owe anyone forgiveness and your sister picking someone as a partner doesn't mandate you liking or even accepting them.\n\nPersonally, I definitely agree with that take. We in the comments don't know to what extent he dealt but the hard fact is he was a provider of one of the most life ruining drugs in existence and no matter how responsibly he was dealing (which is a stretch of the term responsible) he still was putting that out there. He can say he's sorry after a prison sentence and say he's reformed but I'm with you, unless you stay clean for a long while I have no reason to believe you.", "YTA- the man did his time and is allowed a second chance. It\u2019s completely rational to be skeptical and be careful at first around them but they deserve a chance. You also have no idea what this persons upbringing or home life or anything else was like so you have no idea what caused them to turn to selling drugs. There are some people who do it just to make a quick buck and don\u2019t care who it hurts. There are also people who do it because it\u2019s the only way to keep food on their table and the lights on.", "NTA. IMO, you made a reasonable deal with her even though you worded it harshly. I've known way too many drug dealers and users here in my country who've been in and out of prisons, have promised to change to their families, and then go back spiraling down that hellhole after a few months of being \"clean\" despite going through rehab, therapy, and counseling.\n\nThe people here who think he deserves a chance this very early in his \"recovery\" have probably never had a drug addict in their life.

I am going with YTA.\n\nI have a friend who is an addict. He is my best friend of nearly 20 years. We have seen and gone through everything together and lived together twice and it was the second that he became an addict. His behavior had completed changed to the point I couldn\u2019t even recognize him and after two years I kicked him out. It was a clean move, no drama and no anything, he tried but I nipped it the bud. It became better for him and after a year he has finally started going into a professional setting and is turning his life back around and has become the person I knew and we remain best friends.\n\nMy point is that yes you are right, dealers do taken advantage for selfish reasons. But prisons are meant to be the punishment, and they should also be the source of rehabilitation as well. Granted not here in America. But, you didn\u2019t know this guy when he was a dealer and you\u2019re not making an effort to know him now. Who knows what he is like and what steps he is been taking to make reparations in ways that he can. Will it undue the damage that was done to others? No, nothing can. Can anyone fix every single big and small mistake they made whether the after effects were singular or multiple? No. \n\nIf you want someone to fix their behavior and then punish them for their attempts then you are enabling them to go back to the bad behavior because you\u2019re showing them that nothing matters so why not be the thing you treat them to be.

Other people made the choice to buy the drugs, they are responsible for themselves. This would be like blaming car companies for auto deaths or alcohol for alcohol poisoning and not the people who make those choices.", "They may know some former Meth dealers and not realise it, most might not be as forthcoming about their past due to how judgemental some people can be.", "My late grandfather did a long career as a minister, a lot of it in prisons. He always used to say there are two things that can make a man change his life around, get out of the vicious circle of drugs and violence, either when he finds Jesus or when he finds love. So, it is possible that this guy has changed and is going to church with clean intentions and is a loving partner to this sister. I'd be wary, but it's possible.", "Flip side of that is that churches are often the only places who will support someone after they leave prison. I say this as an atheist who thinks religion does way more harm than good, but I know of multiple religious centres here in the UK who do practice \"proper\" Christianity when it comes to not judging others. \n\nI work with several former offenders who can't get a job because of their record and church volunteering is pretty much the only way they can get some kind of work on their CV.", "That\u2019s very true. I wasn\u2019t trying to excuse that fact, OP says her sister is her best friend she should trust her sister\u2019s judgment and at least meet him. Then she base her decision off her *own* judgment of him. If anything she should meet him just to know what he looks like and more about him, he *did* just get out of prison. \n\nOP has not only removed this option for herself but their mother as well, so now neither of them know anything about the man from prison their sister/daughter is dating.", "My ex did that. He was a felon and drug addict. He \u201cfound Jesus\u201d and went to church regularly to look good. So when he started using again and was abusive to me, no one believed me", "Yeah but I never know how famous anyone is outside their own country. I barely know who any actor is most of the time and I only learn their names accidentally. Apologies for assuming. \n\nOur prison system in America is incredibly broken and does not have a reform component, it is purely a form of punishment. Some programs exist to try and improve while locked away but they are few and far between and usually under funded.", "Lol ok I feel dumb no Tysm\ud83d\ude00", "Still an AH move to not meet him though. If he seems dodgy af in person then you\u2019d know he wasn\u2019t reformed", "People can get better even if the prison system isn't designed for that purpose.\n\nBe careful and guarded around someone with a past like his, but treating him like a drug dealer for the rest of his life is just gonna make him a drug dealer again.\n\nIt kills me to see my former addict family members treated like animals despite being clean for years.", "So you think people don't reform in prison? Because they absolutely do, despite the work being for profit. Terrible take.", "Not the same as what OP said....\n\nOnce sold meth = sold  meth in the past\n\nSold meth once = sold meth on one occasion.\n\nNot sure why it's assumed that he reformed just because he's out of prison, recidivism is extremely high amongst (making an assumption this is in the US).", "OP's post: \"who once sold meth.\"\n\nthis doesn't mean the guy sold meth ONE time. it means the guy USED to sell meth i.e. once upon a time.\n\ni am once again begging people to read.", "Where does OP say he sold meth once?", "You sound like you\u2019ve never met a real life person before. Like anyone from any of these demographics. If you can\u2019t understand that the less fortunate are much more likely to be sympathetic to addicts, I find it hard to believe you\u2019ve spent much time with people in poverty *OR* wealth. You can think of all the reasons you feel that way, but reality is a very different thing and doesn\u2019t give a shit about those.", ">What \"experience with meth, poverty, or addiction\" do you think would make one more sympathetic to a meth dealer lmao?\n\nKnowing any meth dealers, for a start. Do you know any? Do you know any meth users, or users of other drugs of addiction? Because all those people--the users and the dealers--are much more likely to be desperate than evil.\n\n>Most poor people do not sell illegal drugs that kill people. Most people, even in destitute poverty would probably refuse to sell meth.\n\nWay more do than you think they do, my dude. People become real morally flexible when it's the only way to keep a roof over their kids' heads. I got clean off heroin a few years back, and the people I bought dope from felt, for whatever reason, like they had no other choice but to sell it and wanted to stop. At least one of them eventually got into recovery, thank God, and last I heard runs an NA meeting. My wife is a public defender who represents a lot of people on meth charges, and none of them are Pablo Escobar. They're people living in desperate poverty and the occasional knuckleheaded party boy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>People in poverty face the impacts of drugs like meth disproportionately. Why do you presume a poor person would somehow get a more positive enlightened view on an individual who was tangibly, actively acting in the destruction of their community and systems that lead to widespread poverty?\n\nBecause they face the same struggles and temptations, obviously. They know people who sell drugs and why they do it, so they're less likely to cast stones.\n\n>Who may have been the person to give their mother/child/brother the drugs that killed them?\n\nMy best friend died of a heroin overdose last year, if that gives you any perspective. I found his body.\n\n>\"The poors and the druggies will definitely understand the person selling meth and love them!\" is not the enlightened view that somehow anyone here thinks it is\n\nThe poors and the druggies *will* generally have more empathy for people who have been in trouble for drugs, whether or not they love them.", "Since you\u2019re wildly speculating about what this man may or may not have done, please extend the same courtesy to me. Let\u2019s speculate, for example, that this man was driven to deal drugs by absolute abject economic necessity which, oftentimes, is a reason given for why people join the military. The military similarly \u201cruins lives and kills people.\u201d Does your moralism extend to them as well?", "As a drug addict in recovery, your take placing all the blame on the dealers for the impact their product has on people\u2019s lives is hot garbage. People who do drugs seek them out quite willfully as well, addiction is a disease but it\u2019s not one where you\u2019re just fucked. \u201cOpe, I\u2019m an addict, of COURSE I sold the car for drugs \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u201d yeah no. Ask any addict in recovery and they will tell you they don\u2019t blame their dealers. Lots of drug dealers are also addicts and do it because that\u2019s how they keep it up. It absolutely doesn\u2019t make it ok, but the way you talk about it makes it seem like you\u2019ve only ever seen drug dealers and addicts on TV shows.", "A lot of people are dealt horrible cards, let's not remove personal agency and responsibility from people who grew up impoverished, it's infantilising", "I know the USA prison system exists to make money and all else is secondary but people can and do get out of it positively. \n\nOP assuming he sisters bf is automatically walter white (breaking bad) with no info is pre judging, based on  stereotypes that may or may not be true. \n\nSadly bf may be an ass who didnt learn at all from his past and if so i hope sister gets away safely. \n\nHowever he may now be the nicest guy you will ever meet for the rest of your life and in fact he was only dealing to raise money to feed his 4 sisters as he was left looking after them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is the AH for pre judging on little to know info and setting rules on her sisters relationship", "People definitely can overcome the prison system that\u2019s designed against them. And I do hope changes can be made so the focus is no longer profit. \n\nI was just refuting the comment above mine that says he went to prison and reformed, which sadly isn\u2019t always the case. \n\nI\u2019m sorry to hear about your family, it\u2019s a shame the stigma that surrounds addiction. And the unwarranted shame placed upon them while they struggle to overcome it.", "True, I read that part a little wrong. \n\nI just wouldn't discount someone because they've been to jail.", "I am from a poor neighborhood. \n\n\nNearly all my family are addicts, including both my parents. \n\nI've never met a single person who feels anything but loathing for a meth dealer. And I've never met a single poor person that would ever sell meth and willingly kill people because they are \"\"\"\"less fortunate\"\"\"\".\n\n\nMy former best friend's parent was convicted of drug dealing and not even they were this sympathetic towards themselves lol. No, absolutely nobody feels the way that you do. What you're arguing isn't ethically or morally consistent in a vacuum or on the theoretical level, let alone when you have to face the fact that your entire theory here is that the people who have died and suffered the most from people like this boyfriend, would somehow magically feel the most bad for him? \n\nYou say \"I've never met a real person before\". Your argument is that people who have lost their friends and family and possibly even their own health to meth, would somehow feel sympathy for the people killing them. So in any \"real life\" terms this argument is completely ridiculous. The only way this argument of yours was logical again goes with the complete stereotyping of poverty, that if you don't have money you somehow completely lose your morals and would be happy to be a part of a system that is actively killing people. This is how movies portray poverty -- as if poor people are nonthinking animals.\n\nAgain, very far from the supposed enlightened take you seem to think you're exuding here.", ">If you can\u2019t understand that the less fortunate are much more likely to be sympathetic to addicts\n\nWe're not talking about *addicts*, we're talking about *drug dealers*.", "People who get out of it positively have money on the outside and a support system. \n\nDo you think going to college in prison is free? Commissary is free? Books are free? \n\nIf you don\u2019t have people who love you on the outside you will continue to commit crime in prison and outside because you have to survive.", "Current dealers and recovering addicts/former dealers aren\u2019t the same thing. Nobody has sympathy for a current dealer. And this is not how everyone that\u2019s poor is. Not even the majority, but WAY WAY more likely than rich people. \n\nNobody is saying you should treat someone who is selling meth like they are not selling meth, but nobody is selling meth here! Caring about recovering addicts, even if they\u2019re former dealers, isn\u2019t losing morals. You\u2019re not helping them sell drugs or being part of the system that kills people. literally the opposite. You\u2019re trying to stop it from happening again.\n\nAnd have you just never met people that help recovering addicts? Like again I just don\u2019t think you\u2019ve spoken to many people. Because they\u2019re real, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve never met one that came from wealth, unless they\u2019d lost it after becoming an addict, I guess.\n\nPeople that do these things are disproportionately affected by addiction, many people who lost people. THATS WHY THEY WANT PEOPLE TO GET BETTER!!!\n\nI also think you\u2019re conflating sympathy with compassion, respect, and human decency. Saying poor people are more likely to care about a recovering addict isn\u2019t less morality, it\u2019s more. And it\u2019s also just the case. Like an addict is going to find more compassion as an addict from people that came up poor than people that never struggled."]}
