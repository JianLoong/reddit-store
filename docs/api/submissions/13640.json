Doesn\u2019t always mean sex. \n\nTo spend 2 hours talkin to his gf that long that he just went back out again to the cinema is a clear giveaway of how much you monopolised the time. \n\nThat being said. The GF could have cut the convo short if she wanted to be alone with your brother so it\u2019s not entirely you\u2019re fault, the reason you\u2019re an asshole is because you don\u2019t think your brother had a right to be annoyed when in his own words you took away quality time from him.", "YTA. not for talking to her, bc i think if she seemed willing to talk and you didn't know that they wanted to be alone, it's not entirely your fault. i think YTA for the way you treated your brother AFTER he told you. you invalidated his feelings, and basically called him pathetic on reddit. apologize to your brother and stop bothering them. if you want to hang out with her, make plans with her yourself.", "This is so awkward.  Annoying big sister inserted herself into a two person hang out to which she wasn\u2019t invited.

You're kind of TA for saying it's cringe because he wanted to cuddle and nap with her, which is literally the best thing in the world.", "So in your mind, spending time with a girl just being together, without a defined activity (movie) or fucking, is a waste of time. \n\nExcept that you spent two hours with your brother\u2019s girlfriend - who I will add add likely only did so for fear of being rude - doing exactly what he wanted to be doing. \n\nThis goes beyond being an AH.

Bro could have snidely asked her if  she\u2019s tired and try to avoid the 2h chatting in the first place. If that doesn\u2019t work then uh, the convo is just more entertaining that sleeping then. F", "I'm going against the grain here. Nta, if the girlfriend wanted to end the conversation and sleep, she could have said something to OP. Hey, Op, I told your brother we would nap before the movie. End of conversation. Now ops brother wants to be mad at her because gf didn't want to nap anymore and had fun conversing with OP. It's not a big deal. Brother told Op after the fact that she wanted to nap. How would the Op even rectify the situation at that point? And let's be honest, it's awesome that siblings get along with s.os. I'm sure Op would love her brother and her boyfriend being able to talk for two hours. It's his first GF he will soon realize how awesome it is that Op wants to have friendly conversations. Ops brother could have tried to get his gf out of the room whilst talking. But he waited and then yelled at her afterward. This is not going to be his only time to cuddle with Gf. But it may be the last time she tries to be friendly to your gf. Shame.", "NTA. She can make her own choices. I think she would have said somewhere in mid conversation that she wanted to nap if she was that tired. I get his point of view too though. It\u2019s understandable why he is mad, he wanted to spend extra time with her and give her some more affection, but you really aren\u2019t at fault.", "NTA this time. But maybe be more conscious next time \n\nAt the end of the day, if she didn\u2019t want to talk to you. She could have stopped. Your brother also could of said something like \u201chey let\u2019s go to my room\u201d \n\nI get why he would be annoyed but it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA. Your brother needs to understand that his gf is a human being that can make her own decisions, and if she rather wouldn't nap/sleep with him/whatever, it's up to her. You or your brother cannot dictate to her what to do with her time.", "NTA - you were just chatting with a friend, it wouldn\u2019t have been that hard for your brother to have said \u201calright, we\u2019re gonna go hang out in my room for a little, catch you later!\u201d", "NAH\n\nShe\u2019s a person that should make her own mind up.\n\nThough I would recognize they were on a date and not monopolize the time.", "NTA.\n  Your brother could have just taken his girlfriend to his room if she wanted to lay down.\n\n His girlfriend could of excused her self from the conversation.\n\nIt's not like you were hovering over them in his room right?\n\n\n>Later my brother got mad at me, like he seemed genuinely upset by this, saying I should\u2019ve realised he wanted to be alone with her. \n\nHum. You were at the house first..  they came in AFTER you.  Maybe if they wanted to be alone they should have gone somewhere where there was no one?", "NTA. Your brother just missed something big. Intimacy takes many forms and your partner having a good moment with a family member is huge for a relationship. She may feel closer to him now because you two had such a long chat.\nEdit: to everyone saying OP took time away from them, it takes two to tango. The gf wanted the convo otherwise she would have cut it short.", "Info: op how old are you?", "NTA, but maybe you should let her initiate next time.", "NAH, I wonder if the girlfriend thought cuddling would lead to the discussion of sex and she didn\u2019t want to be put in that situation.", "NTA.
