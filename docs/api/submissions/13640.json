Doesn\u2019t always mean sex. \n\nTo spend 2 hours talkin to his gf that long that he just went back out again to the cinema is a clear giveaway of how much you monopolised the time. \n\nThat being said. The GF could have cut the convo short if she wanted to be alone with your brother so it\u2019s not entirely you\u2019re fault, the reason you\u2019re an asshole is because you don\u2019t think your brother had a right to be annoyed when in his own words you took away quality time from him.", "YTA. not for talking to her, bc i think if she seemed willing to talk and you didn't know that they wanted to be alone, it's not entirely your fault. i think YTA for the way you treated your brother AFTER he told you. you invalidated his feelings, and basically called him pathetic on reddit. apologize to your brother and stop bothering them. if you want to hang out with her, make plans with her yourself.", "This is so awkward.

Bro could have snidely asked her if  she\u2019s tired and try to avoid the 2h chatting in the first place. If that doesn\u2019t work then uh, the convo is just more entertaining that sleeping then. F", "I'm going against the grain here. Nta, if the girlfriend wanted to end the conversation and sleep, she could have said something to OP. Hey, Op, I told your brother we would nap before the movie. End of conversation. Now ops brother wants to be mad at her because gf didn't want to nap anymore and had fun conversing with OP. It's not a big deal. Brother told Op after the fact that she wanted to nap. How would the Op even rectify the situation at that point? And let's be honest, it's awesome that siblings get along with s.os. I'm sure Op would love her brother and her boyfriend being able to talk for two hours. It's his first GF he will soon realize how awesome it is that Op wants to have friendly conversations. Ops brother could have tried to get his gf out of the room whilst talking.

Your brother needs to understand that his gf is a human being that can make her own decisions, and if she rather wouldn't nap/sleep with him/whatever, it's up to her.

The gf wanted the convo otherwise she would have cut it short.", "Info: op how old are you?", "NTA, but maybe you should let her initiate next time.", "NAH, I wonder if the girlfriend thought cuddling would lead to the discussion of sex and she didn\u2019t want to be put in that situation.", "NTA.

But if you find a way to fix your attitude he can have your back when you need it most. Right now you don't deserve that from him. YTA", "You seem to be jealous of your brother.", "I think OP is primarily into herself. Monopolizing someone else\u2019s guest is often due to excessive egotism.", "It\u2019s why coffee or lunch is a better first date since you get to interact rather than sit passively, but they\u2019re just kids. Movie is fine.", "How is she supposed to know not to talk to someone else's date for 2 hours when they arrive?  \n\nReally?", "Happy Cake day! \ud83c\udf82", ">Nobody talks for two hours just to be polite.\n\nYes, they do.\n\nSource: I've met people, worked places that other people also work at, have been in meetings, have been around friends of friends, have been at family events, and am also a person that exists.", "Yeah and she\u2019s shitty for rubbing that in", "Why would you say that? Did something in the story indicate that she was more experienced? hmm...", "Sometimes siblings need hitting.\n\nTalking can only get you so far and will not always yield the desired results", "Where was ops brother during this 2-hour long conversation, though? He could have stepped in and said hey she is tired. We are going to have alone time. And yet he waits till after it all happens?", "\u201cLoving someone? Wanting to be with them? Cringe\u201d", "Right?  I imagine that a part of being either confident or nervous around girls is how you\u2019re treated by your sister(s). Especially an older one that you look up to.", "[deleted]", "Oh but she does have a boyfriend! That is so important to her and so necessary in proving her superiority to her brother here. She\u2019s the better one, because omg she has a high school boyfriend.", "Or maybe hanging out together at one of their houses to chat and chill before going to a movie? If OP doesn't ruin it of course.", "My guess is that OP started talking with her friend and time got away from them.\n\nClearly OP didn't deliberately interrupt his date.", "I left my own comment with context and an explanation. However, I think from context clues, you could determine that I said \"YTA\" because OP has a shitty attitude.", "I'm totally with you, you should start by deleting yours", "She\u2019s obviously not superior & better because her boyfriend doesn\u2019t even love her enough to show her affection. The poor girl doesn\u2019t know what a healthy relationship looks like & she\u2019s projecting that onto her brother. \n\n(P.S. I know you were being sarcastic about being superior lol)", "> Clearly OP didn't deliberately interrupt his date.\n\nOP deliberately talked to her for 2 hours.   The date starts when the person arrives.  \n\nSo yes, OP took deliberate actions that resulted in interrupting the date.  \n\nWhether or not OP did it just for selfish attention or to interrupt the date is irrelevant.  \n\nPeople that are not self absorbed would not start a conversation past \"hello\" when someone else's date comes over and they know they're on a date.", "Girls can find their farts delectable too bro", "Nope, I stand by my comment. I downvote every comment that's a judgement with nothing else in it.", "You know what? Bet. I'll do anything for my fans. \n\nFor reference, or if you wish to continue downvoting me: \n\n\"Not sure why super fucking useless comments like this get upvoted. No context, no explanation. Whatever.\"", "That\u2019s true. I\u2019m guessing her boyfriend is long distance or something.", "i mean\u2026..yeah? the comment still has the wrong pronouns tho", "YTA", "Cool. Do you feel better now?", "LOL. And my comment was useless?", ">Not sure why super fucking useless comments like this get upvoted. No context, no explanation. Whatever.\n\nYou do know they have a bot counting YTA, NTA and NAH to determine what to tag the post as right? It's not a useless comment they are legit throwing in a vote to determine whether or not the OP is an AH or not"]}
