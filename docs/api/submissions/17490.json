During the pandemic his gf got pregnant. He moved her in with his roommates who were not happy. The roommates left and  they resigned with the landlord just themselves but his gf couldn\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t find a job and he lost his job a few months later and couldn\u2019t pay rent. They stayed for 7 months and then got evicted. Now they have an eviction on their record and terrible credit because they lived off of credit card so they have thousands in credit card debt. \n\nI didn\u2019t want them moving in, my son(38M) lived at home until he was 31 so we had a lot of trouble getting him to move out. But his gf was giving birth soon so we took them in. They stayed for almost a year and the deal was, they both get jobs, they help pay utilities and pay off their credit cards and find a place to live. They were only suppose to stay for 6 months but they wouldn\u2019t move out when we asked at the end of 6 months. They said because of the eviction on their record no one would rent to them. They also didn\u2019t make enough to pay utilities. So my husband and I paid more in utilities and they ate for free as well since they would take from the fridge and wouldn\u2019t buy any groceries themselves. We offered to help them with baby expenses (diapers, car seat etc) at first but it\u2019s been almost a year and we are still paying for it. They were doing door dash but not working more than 3-4h a day. I kept trying to get my son to get a full time job but he just got angry and accused me of nagging him. His gf also is very messy and doesn\u2019t clean up after herself. I\u2019ve changed more diapers and fed her son more than she has and it\u2019s infuriating because they chose to have a child but won\u2019t take responsibility. \n\nMy husband and I have been retired for 2 years now and we had planned to move to Chile were I am from. We were suppose to sell the house last year and didn\u2019t just to let them stay but it\u2019s now been over a year and we were sick of it. We kept telling them they had to move out and they just ignored us so we put our house up for sale. We had wanted to renovate it first but they wouldn\u2019t let us into their bathroom and room so we decided just to sell as is. We got a fair offer and closed in a week end told them they had 2 months to move. My son yelled at us for kicking them out and not caring about him and shattered our decorative vase we had.\n\nThey finally moved out and we are in between places and will be going to Chile next month. But my son and his gf currently have no where to live. They are staying with a friend now but they are only letting them stay until the end of the month and then they will have to figure it out. My son yells at my over the phone and tells me I\u2019m never allowed to see my grandson again for kicking us out. I don\u2019t know where I went wrong that he couldn\u2019t be an adult and get a job and move out without being forced.", "created_utc": 1684348879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ka9y9/aita_for_kicking_my_son_his_gf_and_my_grandson/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were way more patient than you could have been.", "NTA.\n\nBut perhaps set up a trust for that kid for when he comes of age because it sounds like he may need it.", "OP, you are NTA. Your son and his gf did this to themselves. 7 months is a long time to go before being evicted. They could have taken steps to get back on their feet. They did not. Once they moved in with you, they could have taken steps to pay off their credit cards and get back on their feet. They did not. It is unfortunate that a child is caught in the middle of all this, because his parents are not willing to take responsibility for themselves. But, you have earned your retirement, and your son's entitlement, is his problem, not yours. Maybe, this will be the wake up call he needs. With no home to return to, and with you in a foreign country, he might finally be forced to stand on his own. If you had let them stay, which was clearly what their plan was all along, you would have been an asshole to yourself.", "NTA. Your son is the epitome of entitlement attitude.", "NTA - He's a grown a\\*\\* man and it's time for him to grow up and take care of his kid.", "NTA, not close.", "Nta.  They were talking advantage of you.  You did the right thing", "Nta- there\u2019s a lot of things parents do or might do that can contribute to how our grown kids behave but there\u2019s also the fact that sometimes even the very best parents raise a kid who reflects none of how they were raised and taught. We are each our own people and responsible for our own choices. Your son and gf have made horrible choices and will now face the consequences of them. I do feel terrible for the baby but none of it is on you. Nta.", "NTA - They had 8 months to figure things out. I feel bad for their baby, but at 38, he should be old enough to be on his own feet. Good luck for your move to Chile!", "NTA. Your son is 38 and needs to step up and be a freaking adult. You can't live your life around him and his problems. Dude needs to grow up and handle his responsibilities, FFS.\n\nAlso, it's not a matter of where \\*you\\* went wrong. This is ALL about where your son went wrong and his poor decision making, as well as his laziness... the job market is tough, sure. But he could find work if he wanted it. He can't be above working a fast food job just to get by for now. \n\nThis isn't something you did. It's what he's not doing. Don't take that weight on your shoulders. It's not yours to carry.", "NTA.\n\nI know how hard it is to do things like this to family but you gave your kid every opportunity and a soft place to land. At some point he's going to have to figure out how to stand on his own two feet. Go live your life.\n\nAnd keep an eye on the situation with their child. If the mother is neglectful, you may need to get CPS involved as well. So sorry you're having to go through this and best of luck.", "You may have gone wrong no where at all.  Some amazing kids come from awful parents and sometimes (though rarer) amazing parents end up raising shitbirds. \n\nI do worry for the kid and I think you should call CPS.  This baby is a baby and there is a decent chance of adoption since the two of them can't get it together.  \n\nIf I were you I'd try to come to peace with never seeing your grandchild because even if they keep the kid, they will always use that child as as a pawn to get money and housing.  And anytime you say no they will threaten and remove the child.  \n\nYour son is nearly 40.  I'm so sorry because I know you're embarrassed but whether you did a good job or a bad job your job here is done.", "I never understood why kids felt that blackmailing/ threatening their parents with grandchild visitation was a real threat. Aren't parents the ones that benefit the most from free babysitting? \n\nNTA. Enjoy your retirement in Chile.", "NTA. But your son is. He is a freeloader. Don't know eighter where you went wrong. Don't want to judge it\n\nBut maybe if your son and his girlfriend are acting like that, give a tip to cps.", "NTA\n\nHe's never going to grow up, and neither is his girlfriend\n\nSucks for that poor kid, though.", "blud kicked the whole family  \n\n\nanyway NTA", "NTA. They are adults who chose to have a child, it's their responsibility and theirs alone to ensure that they can care for themselves and their child. You've already helped them plenty and if you continue that pattern they will continue to take advantage.", "nta block his ass.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't have any other options. You did what was needed. Your son is a prime example of \"failure to launch\" its from a romcom.  At some point I expect he's going to come back to you for money again. But I don't know that he will ever be able to afford to pay for tickets to bring the baby to visit you in Chili. But when he is looking for more money try to get them to do facetime or google meeting so you can see the baby.  I'm also a bit suspicious of baby momma. When she isn't being supported anymore I expect she might take off. With or without the baby is the question. You sadly just need to wait and see what works out.", "NTA but you need to see it you can get custody of your grandson I don\u2019t think that they will be good parents", "Many companies are laying people off right now. Not hiring them (but I\u2019m sure he can find something for the time being). It\u2019s very unfortunate about your son. He was not smart to have a baby since he can\u2019t or won\u2019t support him. That is his kid for life and they are not cheap. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but your family is now on the street. Your son and grandkid are homeless. Very sad situation. Maybe the gfs mom will take a turn and help some. Maybe a church has a benevolence ministry that can help them. They should also move to a cheaper area if possible. I\u2019m sure there are some resources online. \n\nHe should look into cutting costs wherever possible - diapers, food, gas, entertainment. Having a kid means making sacrifices. He needs to live below his means.  A recession is upon us. I\u2019ll pray for y\u2019all.\n\nAlso, he owes you a vase.", "NTA.\n\nYour son is nearly 40 and acting like a teenager.\n\nAre you sure you want to leave the country though? Yiu'll hardly ever see your grandson. They change so much and so quickly in these early years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Getting out of the country is the absolute very best thing you could do in this situation and I'm delighted that that was already on the board.

However, your son and his girlfriend have come face to face with the fact that they are adults with a child they are responsible for and they need to grow up. Frankly, it might be better if some other family member, on your side or hers, would take that child and leave the two of them to live in a box under an overpass somewhere.
