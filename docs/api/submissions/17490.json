Once they moved in with you, they could have taken steps to pay off their credit cards and get back on their feet. They did not. It is unfortunate that a child is caught in the middle of all this, because his parents are not willing to take responsibility for themselves. But, you have earned your retirement, and your son's entitlement, is his problem, not yours. Maybe, this will be the wake up call he needs.

This baby is a baby and there is a decent chance of adoption since the two of them can't get it together.  \n\nIf I were you I'd try to come to peace with never seeing your grandchild because even if they keep the kid, they will always use that child as as a pawn to get money and housing.

But when he is looking for more money try to get them to do facetime or google meeting so you can see the baby.  I'm also a bit suspicious of baby momma.

That is his kid for life and they are not cheap. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but your family is now on the street. Your son and grandkid are homeless. Very sad situation.

I\u2019m sure there are some resources online. \n\nHe should look into cutting costs wherever possible - diapers, food, gas, entertainment. Having a kid means making sacrifices.

Getting out of the country is the absolute very best thing you could do in this situation and I'm delighted that that was already on the board. I'm very sorry for your grandchild, and I'm sorry for the relationship that you won't be able to have with him. However, your son and his girlfriend have come face to face with the fact that they are adults with a child they are responsible for and they need to grow up. Frankly, it might be better if some other family member, on your side or hers, would take that child and leave the two of them to live in a box under an overpass somewhere.

SO I don't see lots of visits with your Grandchild anyway.\n\nSadly, this is a failure to launch child(lived at home until age 31--presumably freeloading the whole time).  How much of that is on him and how much on you and your husband?

Nevertheless, I can be certain that\u2014at nearly 40\u2014whatever changes he makes are going to have to be intrinsically motivated, because evidently he has been content to freeload for the last few decades. \n\nThe economy being what it is, I understand that getting a job is a lot easier said than done, but it doesn\u2019t really seem like he\u2019s making an effort. If you are concerned for their ability to take care of their child, I\u2019d make a call to Child Protective Services or whatever the equivalent is where you live.\n\nEdit: I also wanted to agree with some of the comments saying to consider setting up a trust for your grandson, if you plan on leaving any sort of inheritance. He\u2019ll be able to get to it when he reaches the age of majority. I worry that whatever you will to your son directly will be spent frivolously and without regard for the well-being of the child.

It's hard and pride gets in the way for a lot of us, causing us to blame others and lash out.  That doesn't excuse your son's behavior, he needed something to get him motivated to step up and take ownership of his life. He has a kid, it's beyond time for him to stop blaming others.", "Nta. \n\nFirst, thank you for taking them in. You didn't have to and you gave them such a great help up out of their situation. They didn't want to accept it though, that's on them. \n\nSecond, chances of you moving to Chile and seeing your grandson would've been slim anyways, unless you footed the entire bill- for all of it. Hopefully, eventually, your son will grow up and you guys can communicate through messages, facetiming, etc, but again, this is on him. Be there when he's ready, but offer no more support. You've done so much already. (With the exception of an inheritance.... I was your son- even now, I still live with my dad, along with my son but I work and pay my way now.. but I'm aware that even letting me stay with him is a huge blessing so any inheritance I may have gotten- I'd rather it go to my son, since again- just letting us stay with him and financially supporting us at times, was more than enough). \n\nThirdly, I hope you have fun back home! Show your husband all the sites, known and unknowns!", "Why do you still talk to him? Stop making him your problem, he\u2019s not.", "NTA. Where you went wrong was letting him stay with you until 31.

Are you sure your grandson is safe with them?", "NTA.\n\nSounds like my brothers. From my point of view, my parents treated my brothers like babies, never made them get jobs (one brother is 30, never had a full time job), bought them cars, never had chores, no discipline. \n\nStill to this day (my sister and I are married) both brothers live at home 30 and 35 years old.

You're NTA because you have been incredibly generous to them and patient with them so far.\n\nBut YTA because you don't understand the current American economy.  Jobs for people like your son and his gf are not easy to get, don't pay well, and don't provide the kind of lifestyle that allows a couple to raise a child.\n\nThe ding in their credit makes it impossible for them to rent an apartment.  So now you've made your son homeless with a family.  He and his gf going to have to make terrible, desperate choices while living on the streets or in their car.  \n\nDo you want your grandchild's mother to be doing sex work?  Or your son to be the one tricking her out?  Do you want your grandchild sleeping in a homeless shelter or worse, in a tent at a homeless encampment?

Is their plan to live off you until you die and they inherit?", "NTA. They are adults so time to grow up and face their responsibilities. Either they get full time jobs trading shifts so they can care for the baby or one gets a full time job with the other a part time job.
