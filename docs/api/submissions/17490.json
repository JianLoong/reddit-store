Once they moved in with you, they could have taken steps to pay off their credit cards and get back on their feet. They did not. It is unfortunate that a child is caught in the middle of all this, because his parents are not willing to take responsibility for themselves. But, you have earned your retirement, and your son's entitlement, is his problem, not yours. Maybe, this will be the wake up call he needs.

This baby is a baby and there is a decent chance of adoption since the two of them can't get it together.  \n\nIf I were you I'd try to come to peace with never seeing your grandchild because even if they keep the kid, they will always use that child as as a pawn to get money and housing.

But when he is looking for more money try to get them to do facetime or google meeting so you can see the baby.  I'm also a bit suspicious of baby momma.

That is his kid for life and they are not cheap. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH but your family is now on the street. Your son and grandkid are homeless. Very sad situation.

I\u2019m sure there are some resources online. \n\nHe should look into cutting costs wherever possible - diapers, food, gas, entertainment. Having a kid means making sacrifices.

Getting out of the country is the absolute very best thing you could do in this situation and I'm delighted that that was already on the board. I'm very sorry for your grandchild, and I'm sorry for the relationship that you won't be able to have with him. However, your son and his girlfriend have come face to face with the fact that they are adults with a child they are responsible for and they need to grow up. Frankly, it might be better if some other family member, on your side or hers, would take that child and leave the two of them to live in a box under an overpass somewhere.

SO I don't see lots of visits with your Grandchild anyway.\n\nSadly, this is a failure to launch child(lived at home until age 31--presumably freeloading the whole time).  How much of that is on him and how much on you and your husband?

Nevertheless, I can be certain that\u2014at nearly 40\u2014whatever changes he makes are going to have to be intrinsically motivated, because evidently he has been content to freeload for the last few decades. \n\nThe economy being what it is, I understand that getting a job is a lot easier said than done, but it doesn\u2019t really seem like he\u2019s making an effort. If you are concerned for their ability to take care of their child, I\u2019d make a call to Child Protective Services or whatever the equivalent is where you live.\n\nEdit: I also wanted to agree with some of the comments saying to consider setting up a trust for your grandson, if you plan on leaving any sort of inheritance. He\u2019ll be able to get to it when he reaches the age of majority. I worry that whatever you will to your son directly will be spent frivolously and without regard for the well-being of the child.

It's hard and pride gets in the way for a lot of us, causing us to blame others and lash out.  That doesn't excuse your son's behavior, he needed something to get him motivated to step up and take ownership of his life. He has a kid, it's beyond time for him to stop blaming others.", "Nta. \n\nFirst, thank you for taking them in. You didn't have to and you gave them such a great help up out of their situation. They didn't want to accept it though, that's on them. \n\nSecond, chances of you moving to Chile and seeing your grandson would've been slim anyways, unless you footed the entire bill- for all of it. Hopefully, eventually, your son will grow up and you guys can communicate through messages, facetiming, etc, but again, this is on him. Be there when he's ready, but offer no more support. You've done so much already. (With the exception of an inheritance.... I was your son- even now, I still live with my dad, along with my son but I work and pay my way now.. but I'm aware that even letting me stay with him is a huge blessing so any inheritance I may have gotten- I'd rather it go to my son, since again- just letting us stay with him and financially supporting us at times, was more than enough). \n\nThirdly, I hope you have fun back home! Show your husband all the sites, known and unknowns!", "Why do you still talk to him? Stop making him your problem, he\u2019s not.", "NTA. Where you went wrong was letting him stay with you until 31.

Are you sure your grandson is safe with them?", "NTA.\n\nSounds like my brothers.

You're NTA because you have been incredibly generous to them and patient with them so far.\n\nBut YTA because you don't understand the current American economy.  Jobs for people like your son and his gf are not easy to get, don't pay well, and don't provide the kind of lifestyle that allows a couple to raise a child.\n\nThe ding in their credit makes it impossible for them to rent an apartment.  So now you've made your son homeless with a family.  He and his gf going to have to make terrible, desperate choices while living on the streets or in their car.  \n\nDo you want your grandchild's mother to be doing sex work?  Or your son to be the one tricking her out?  Do you want your grandchild sleeping in a homeless shelter or worse, in a tent at a homeless encampment?

Is their plan to live off you until you die and they inherit?", "NTA. They are adults so time to grow up and face their responsibilities. Either they get full time jobs trading shifts so they can care for the baby or one gets a full time job with the other a part time job. You have more a year to get their crap together and they didn\u2019t do so. How many more years would you be willing to put your life on hold waiting for them to become adults?

Go live your life and let them lie in the bed they\u2019ve created.", "NTA, however you went wrong about 20 some odd years ago.", "I unfortunately also have an eviction on my record from years back, with that I use an apartment finder who helps find apartments that will lease to me.", "NTA. Your son sounds awful and has treated you terribly and used you for years. Honestly, they'll figure out something. I wouldn't worry about it. The man is 40 years old. Have fun in Chile and enjoy your retirement. You deserve it.\n\nAs for never seeing your grandson, you know good at well he's going to want something again from you. So it's an empty threat and one he'll constantly dangle over you to try to get more from you.", "Nta. \n\nDoes the situation suck? Yep. \nIs the grown son not being fair or reasonable? Yep\n\nHe made his bed and now he has to lay in it. \n\nYour son doesnt like the situation because of his choices. No one elses. His. His gf is in the situation because of her choices. \n\nThe only innocent is the child they have together. They had sex, as grown adults who knows what the consequences of sex can be. They had the consequence. They need to raise, live and deal with that. \n\nYou made your choices. You lived your life and are ready for the next step. No shame in that. You survived a pandemic and finding out that despite your best efforts your grown adult son is entitled and dowsnt have the work ethic needed for tge lifestyle he wants. \nBut he is an adult. And not 20 with no clue. Sometimes you gotta give a little tough love and it will hurt. That is okay. \n\nHopefully they learn to be better parents thru this struggle they are gonna endure.", "Nta kick them out maybe an asshole for allowing him to get to this point in general.", "It's crazy to me that between two people they couldn't even split utilities. They wouldn't let her in the bathroom, either it was disgusting af, or they're using and it's disgusting AF.", "I think you mean \"should\" not \"could.\"", "As I told my mom about my 35 year old brother, sometimes you just have to love people from over there.  At a safe distance.", "I feel sorry for the child... they're the biggest victim here", "Good idea. OP should just make sure that the parents can\u2019t interact with it. Maybe wait until the grandson is older (like 25 instead of 18) before he has access to it/strict rules on what it can be used on, so the parents can\u2019t try to pressure him into giving them anything", "At thier age they probably don\u2019t have the money to set up a trust for the grandson. Plus he isn\u2019t their responsibility. It\u2019s time they take care of themselves.", "He is a freeloader. Don't know eighter where you went wrong.", "Same here. Honestly I\u2019d reply back \u2018don\u2019t threaten me with a good time\u2019 or something.", "He lived with her until he was 31. He hasn\u2019t even been gone a decade. He had plenty of time to work really hard on saving while he was an adult still living with mommy and daddy and when he moved back in to live with them again. Not to mention that the economy hasn\u2019t been in the state it\u2019s currently in the entire time he\u2019s been reliant on them. If they continue to help him he\u2019s gonna keep refusing to learn how to live on his own until he runs his parents into an early grave. You can only do so much to help someone who truly doesn\u2019t want to help themselves and it seems like their son doesn\u2019t really want to help himself.", "She hasn't \"made\" her son and family anything.  They actively let the eviction go through when they could have left.  There are jobs that only require a high school education.  \n\nOff the top of my head I know, for sure TSA and IRS are hiring (and a lot of those employees dont have stellar finances) a few months ago SSA was hiring.  Those jobs didnt require a college degree, have stable hours and good benefits. Temp agencies are always hiring. \n\nThere are federal and often state programs for impoverished families because no one wants to see kids on the street.  Section 8, food stamps, general assistance.  Son and girlfriend haven't bothered to try for any of these.  Even with their piddly door dash gigs they haven't bothered to save any money while mooching off OP", "\u2026and they WILL try", "And that any attempts by the parents will forfeit the trust fund and it to be donated to charity instead of the grandchild.", "Or a first car.", "That's well and good in theory, but they clearly have zero intention of ever doing that, so it's the kid that's going to suffer through no fault of his own. I agree the grandparents shouldn't have to shell out for his maintenance if they don't want or can't afford to, but if they ARE able and willing, it may well be the only way the poor kid gets a fair shot in life.", "That is ok but I don\u2019t know why people are downvoteing me for this", "Oh, yeah. They're definitely the type to blame the kid for having basic kids' needs. Thinking things through and taking responsibility for their choices doesn't seem to be something they're capable of.", "I just don\u2019t know to many retired couples who have the money to raise someone else\u2019s child. \n\nAnd even if they did have the money they should enjoy their retirement.", "Fully agree. It's just sad for the kid. But absolutely not their duty."]}
