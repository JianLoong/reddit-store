Her dad took it back to the grill and destroyed them. So now I buy Select grade meat. \n\nI've been buying some excellent quality Wagyu for when my parents visit. Not every single time.

One is having dinner at home. The other is taking the family out as a treat. Also, your parents enjoyed being able to go out to places. I\u2019m pretty sure that they would just as much enjoy those activities with their son and daughter-in-law just like the in-laws, but because the in-laws don\u2019t like expensive food that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t spend the money on it.\n\nIn-laws clearly don\u2019t understand the effort and significance of the meat and since they don\u2019t know the difference, they\u2019re not upset.

And texture to an extent, but mostly it comes down to salt. Specifically the amount of sodium that remains in the meat after cooking. There is always loss as water and fat \"washes\" the sodium out of the meat, but there is less when the meat is cooked to a lower temp. This isn't much of an issue if you are cooking a steak less than half an inch thick because you are salting the steak before cooking it. But the thicker the steak, the less that surface salting will help; unless you are \"dry/wet brining\" in which case you can increase the amount of salt in the meat as the salt is absorbed into the meat (yay ionic diffusion!).\n\nAlso, there's the issue of moisture. The higher the temp, the less moisture is retained, and the more dry the meat will become. The difference between a \"juicy\" well done steak and a dry one can be less than a minute on the heat. There's also the issue that carry-over heat is more of a concern when aiming for a not-dry-as-leather well done steak.\n\nSo, an average-to-thick medium-rare to medium steak will taste better than a well done one because the medium-rare retains more innate salt than the well done one.\n\nThis doesn't apply to things like pot roast though.

It's that he is buying them expensive gifts that are tailored to his preferences and in complete disregard of theirs and when they didn't care for it, he stopped giving them expensive gifts at all.\n\nETA: re-read your comment and just so much wrong there I have to address. \n\n1) a cruise is not an expensive, extravagant vacation. Cruises are one of the cheapest getaway vacations there are. If these steaks for 4 are $200 each and there's 4 of them, that's $800 every year they can put towards something else for the 4 of them to do that all 4 of them actually enjoy. Not just him and his wife leaving her parents uncomfortable and him upset. It would be enough to cover a cruise for 4 after just a few years.  \n\n\n2) if *his* parents find out (not likely as they live far from each set), and would rather do a vacation then they can. And they can eat $20 steaks just like her parents instead of $200 ones every year too. That's up to them. He's catered these steaks to them (not her parents) because he and his parents are foodies. Which is bizarre to me personally but none of mine nor your business just like the \"crappy\" food her parents like isn't our business. Not your food. Not your business.  \n\n\n3) I can't believe your dad has the gall to try to force someone to eat something they've clearly expressed they aren't okay with. If I were your sister I wouldn't eat at all or wouldn't come. It's disrespectful to not have basic respect for personal boundaries moreso than it is to refuse food someone made just because they made it.  \n\n\n4) I was not suggesting he do ALL of those things. It's just a list of ideas of what he could do instead. I specifically said something that's comparable to the $800 meal he makes his parents but that her parents would actually enjoy. As in of a similar monetary value, quality time value, and effort. Part of the effort of a good gift is giving something that the person receiving it will actually like and/or use. You wouldn't gift a pregnant woman a bottle of whiskey at a baby shower just because *you* love whiskey would you?", "Exactly", "YTA, everybody's different,  and you sound like a kid that doesn't want to share his toys because the other kids don't want to play with your toys \"the proper way\". \n\nI love a good med-rare steak but I find steak snobs insufferable. Steak snobs are up there with other self-righteous doucebags for the worst people in the world.  Think overly opinionated vegans, the far right/left, hipsters that prefer vinyl, and others that once they get started their judgment and BS become intolerable. Think about this, you're on the same level as an obnoxious vegan bro, a vegan.\n\nIf they eat it all then it's not going to waste and I am willing to bet that because of the fat content, overcooked Wagyu will still be a moist, delicious, and wonderful experience for parents. If not, only do it once and never again.", "YTA for being a steak snob. If they like it well done, cook it well done. You aren't ruining it by cooking it to order. It's OK to enjoy a nice cut of steak well done.\n\nAnd no, well done isn't burnt to a crisp. Properly well done steak is still tender and juicy, just fully cooked through with no pink remaining.", "YTA. Ugh! You \u201csteak people\u201d are just insufferable. Literally I can think of nothing more annoying and faux pretentious.", "I think a lot of people here are reading that he's like stubbornly serving them steak even though they don't care for it. It sounds like the in laws have steak quite a bit and just prefer overcooked. That's my family. They love steak and love the way I make it, but they can't handle any pink whatsoever. My mom even throws A1 on it much to my infinite sadness. But they would be really disappointed if I was just like eh I'm not gonna make steak anymore because you don't like it a certain way. It might almost be worse to stop making it. Idk, up to OP to read the room on that one, but I don't think it's fair to assume he's just forcing it on them instead of doing something else.", "Let the wife splurge with her money if she wants her parents treated the same. OP's NTA", "I nice pork roast is going to cost less than the prime steak he's serving now.  If the issue the wife has is OP only buying the more expensive stuff when his parents come over, this isn't the solution - it's adding lobster tails on the side of the well done steaks.", "1000% horseshit.  As a kid preferred well done, now medium.  Eaten hundreds of steaks both ways.  The quality of the steak is very noticeable.", "I honestly enjoyed the Two-buck Chuck from Trader Joe's way more than the Mondavi Cabernet my SIL made me try, LOL!!   (I'm such a philistine!!) Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it'll please everyone's palate.", "Sad I had to scroll so far for this. I like my steaks well done, it's not the same thing as burnt, it's just fully cooked.

We're much better cooks than the rest of the extended family, and I'll deal with the additional cost so I can make sure I'm note eating a dry-ass, under-seasoned bird.", "I had family over for dinner a while back and I made roast beef and the way my heart broke when I saw my aunt put it in the microwave for FIVE! MINUTES! because it was pink in the middle, and then put ketchup on it because it \"tasted weird\" (because you blasted the flavor out in the microwave!!!!!) is something I'll never forget. I feel so dramatic saying this but I said I had to get something from the basement and went downstairs and had a little cry. I worked so hard on that dinner.", "Good NY strip or filet mignon might do medium/medwell. I was in my late 20s once I realized I did like steaks.

It\u2019s just not the kind of acts of love they appreciate and also not how they want to treat themselves - when my parents come around to visit I usually try to plan going somewhere they enjoy (like art museums, botanical gardens or hikes) and grab ingredients so we can cook some of my mom\u2019s favorite comfort foods together. \nThey also just love getting little odds and ends from places when we travel. \n\nI can appreciate the desire to want to spend equally on both sides, but it\u2019s possible one set may not care - especially if they\u2019re getting to spend the quality time they want.", "That would give them an out but they\u2019re not in the least.

It's preference. I am well off, travel around the world regularly and if I have to have steak I want it well done. I prefer *not* to eat meat but have run into occasions where it was polite to just go with the flow.
