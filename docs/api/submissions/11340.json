If this was the meal for the one time a year you serve them, I would say to find another way to splurge on them. I did say it several comments up. But you\u2019re making them 9 gourmet dinners a year and doing something different on only the tenth: that\u2019s pretty minor.", "That's the point multiple people are trying to make, though. It doesn't sound like there are other ways he is going out of his way to make things 'special' for her parents. Everything is pretty equal save for the fact that he spends a large amount of money on very special meals for his parents. He should be talking with his wife about what her parents' \"wagyu\" is. They obviously don't value food the way OP and his family do, and thus, the money spent would be wasted, but that doesn't mean there isn't something else that could be done for them that would make OP'S wife feel that he values her parents instead of feeling that he looks down on them.", "Right, I get that. My parents do, too. But if you are grilling one night - can\u2019t you grill some other protein other than steak to avoid the issue?", "Did a well done steak bully you in kindergarden or something? \n\n\nTake a step back and look at the situation from the outside- you spend hundreds of dollars both you and your wife earned to treat your parents like kings while serving her parents trash and sneering at them and talking about them like they're less than because of meat. The condescension is just dripping from your post and I bet you your wife can tell how you think her parents are beneath you. Next time they visit just skip the cooking all together and serve them your yesterday's trash in pet bowls since you talk about them as if they are raccoons anyway. \n\nIt's not about meat, it's about respect. And you obviously have none for your in laws.", "The part where he cooks food to their likes despite finding it unappetizing but yet when he\u2019s served at their home, they cook how they cook and he\u2019ll just have to deal with it.

Everyone got a well done steak.\n\nYet when OP was cooking, he cooked their steak longer than his own, to a doneness he thought they would prefer to the one he liked: medium well. He tried to cater to their tastes, they ignored his.\n\n> The issue here is not specifically the food item, it is the effort put into finding the parents version of \u201cwagyu steak\u201d whether that\u2019s art, music, drink, sports whatever.\n\nI agree, and I doubt they will do the same in any area. That's just the way it is for white, non-Hispanic Americans who eat steak well done. \n\nTrump likes his steak well done and with ketchup, btw.", "I can understand that people enjoy things differently, but, literally, what makes wagyu special will be destroyed if you overcook it.

Just making some kind of effort will likely go a long way here.", "Yeah, could be something other than food/drink or just different food/drink (different kind of meat, dessert, wine, scotch, port, etc) that the in-laws would enjoy and sometimes be spends there.

It's a good bet they're \"meat and potatoes\" sorts.", "Well if I get a steak from a restaurant I ask how they define medium vs medium rare because some places cook theirs differently than the majority.

If I give him that steak raw and let him go to town on the grill what will he pull off the grill?", "He's not saying there's going ti be left overs. It's clear you have never cooked waygu. It's very fatty. If they cook it well done on a grill 80 percent of the steak is going to dissappear because the fat is going to melt away. That's why he doesn't want to get them waygu steaks. It's not like a regular steak.", "I gotcha. My b. I meant more so that they seem like the type who don\u2019t care about food so they haven\u2019t considered whether someone likes food cooked in a different way. Which I agree is rude. That\u2019s why I was suggesting maybe there is something they do highly value that OP also values and they can connect that way. Navigating in-laws who have different values and belief systems can be challenging. I\u2019m suggesting to let go of the steak preference and find common ground.", "How is it a waste?

Our kids are the only kids on his side, so they get lavished with gifts and money on all occasions, whereas my mom gives my kids (and all her six grandkids) chocolate and eggs for Easter, and homemade cookies for a good report card. Also, because I have four siblings, we were able to give my mom a nice gift for her 70th birthday and I just had to chip in $250; we gave a comparable gift to my FIL for his 70th but paid for all of it ourselves because my husband is his only kid\u2014and it wouldn\u2019t be fair of me to insist that we only budget $250 to keep things even.", "They had the official looking diagram on their menu and it checked out... so I just assumed they were a good authority.
