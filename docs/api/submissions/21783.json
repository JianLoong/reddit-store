I am making the choice to get rid of a menu item for cost efficiency and profit, a menu item which an autistic man eats as a 'safe food,' and which I'm fairly certain we are the only diner close by that does it/does it in a way he will eat it. As the owner and manager I can make the choice to just keep the menu item and deal with less profit, but ultimately I suppose I'm choosing my business over him having access to a 'safe food.'\n\n2. I certainly feel like an asshole for it, but our local community and my staff are divided and its become something of an issue overnight.

Mom can make that for him at home if he likes it so much, or he can perhaps try something similar and learn to like it. Surely he goes to other restaurants where they don't have that exact thing and orders something?", "NTA. I would have said NAH if the mom had just expressed her upset and asked you to work with her to come up with a solution since she and her son were longtime customers.

If only one person is buying an item and it requires special ingredients or effort then it does not make sense to keep it on the menu. It is disappointing and frustrating for that family if the person's diet is so limited but that does not mean you are targeting them. If he ate other food on your menu he would be welcome to do so.

You're running a business and you're not obliged to keep serving a dish if it isn't profitable.  That said, I do think you missed an opportunity to go above an beyond for a customer, and that's the sort of thing that can earn a bunch of good word of mouth.\n\nI was actually willing to cut the mother a lot of slack in this case.  I don't think you have a good sense of how challenging it is to take care of a person that is this severely autistic and what this dish meant to her.  It was a source of reprieve amongst a sea of stress and frustration, and you took it away from her (though for good reason).  I can understand her being upset, but when she started review bombing you she crossed the line.  There's just no reason to try and sabotage someone's business like that.\n\nI don't know if you have this lady's contact information, but one nice olive branch gesture might be if you could offer to teach the mother how to make the dish you used to make at your restaurant so that she could try to make it at home.
