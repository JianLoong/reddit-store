{"id": 1258, "submission_id": "ym6wp0", "title": "WIBTA for telling my friend they can\u2019t cook at my house anymore?", "selftext": "So I (21F) live in a house with my boyfriend and 2 housemates. Recently, a friend of mine moved to my town to be closer to me, we\u2019ll call them Eli (20NB). Eli and I have been friends for almost 10 years, however we really only saw each other once a year because they lived about 6 hours away from me. Our friendship has always been a little..strained. They can be very controlling and manipulative at times, but I\u2019ve stayed friends with them because they don\u2019t really have anyone else, and they can be intensely caring and I have tried to take into account that they came from a rough upbringing. \n\nAnyways, on to the problem. Eli is really big on cooking for people, but they\u2019re not very good at cleaning up. Like, after they\u2019re done in a kitchen it literally looks like a tornado wrecked it. Eli has started taking it upon themselves to make these massive dinner plans for our house and basically coming over and destroying our kitchen. \n\nNow normally, if someone cooks for me I don\u2019t mind cleaning up at all, but Eli never really takes the time to get the OK from my housemates or I. Like they\u2019ll ask me and I\u2019ll say I\u2019ll talk to my housemates about it, and they take that as a yes and just come over. The last time they were here, I literally had a mental break down from the state of the kitchen. Bits of food EVERYWHERE, shit spilled all over the counters, piles upon piles of dishes, the floor caked with sticky shit, the oven covered in burnt nastiness. My housemates and I have a variety of different mental health problems, and keeping the kitchen and house clean can be hard on all of us, so when Eli comes through like a wrecking ball it\u2019s immensely frustrating.\n\nAs a side note, I work as a cook, and the last thing I wanna fucking do when I get home is cook. But when Eli is cooking they will guilt us all into helping, and basically say things along the lines of \u201cOh I\u2019m cooking this amazing meal for you guys, the least you could do is help\u201d and shit like that, yet none of us asked them to cook for us and none of us signed up to be sous-chefs. \n\nThe last time I tried to suggest we maybe cook at their place, they got massively offended, and said it was rude of me to suggest that when they are just trying to do something nice for me. So now I\u2019m worried that maybe I would be the asshole if I put my foot down? They are just trying to be kind and cook for us because none of us have the motivation to. \n\nWhat do you think Reddit?", "created_utc": 1667587563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym6wp0/wibta_for_telling_my_friend_they_cant_cook_at_my/", "score": 3, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
