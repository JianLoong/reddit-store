{"id": 1258, "submission_id": "ym6wp0", "title": "WIBTA for telling my friend they can\u2019t cook at my house anymore?", "selftext": "So I (21F) live in a house with my boyfriend and 2 housemates. Recently, a friend of mine moved to my town to be closer to me, we\u2019ll call them Eli (20NB). Eli and I have been friends for almost 10 years, however we really only saw each other once a year because they lived about 6 hours away from me. Our friendship has always been a little..strained. They can be very controlling and manipulative at times, but I\u2019ve stayed friends with them because they don\u2019t really have anyone else, and they can be intensely caring and I have tried to take into account that they came from a rough upbringing. \n\nAnyways, on to the problem. Eli is really big on cooking for people, but they\u2019re not very good at cleaning up. Like, after they\u2019re done in a kitchen it literally looks like a tornado wrecked it. Eli has started taking it upon themselves to make these massive dinner plans for our house and basically coming over and destroying our kitchen. \n\nNow normally, if someone cooks for me I don\u2019t mind cleaning up at all, but Eli never really takes the time to get the OK from my housemates or I. Like they\u2019ll ask me and I\u2019ll say I\u2019ll talk to my housemates about it, and they take that as a yes and just come over. The last time they were here, I literally had a mental break down from the state of the kitchen. Bits of food EVERYWHERE, shit spilled all over the counters, piles upon piles of dishes, the floor caked with sticky shit, the oven covered in burnt nastiness. My housemates and I have a variety of different mental health problems, and keeping the kitchen and house clean can be hard on all of us, so when Eli comes through like a wrecking ball it\u2019s immensely frustrating.\n\nAs a side note, I work as a cook, and the last thing I wanna fucking do when I get home is cook. But when Eli is cooking they will guilt us all into helping, and basically say things along the lines of \u201cOh I\u2019m cooking this amazing meal for you guys, the least you could do is help\u201d and shit like that, yet none of us asked them to cook for us and none of us signed up to be sous-chefs. \n\nThe last time I tried to suggest we maybe cook at their place, they got massively offended, and said it was rude of me to suggest that when they are just trying to do something nice for me. So now I\u2019m worried that maybe I would be the asshole if I put my foot down? They are just trying to be kind and cook for us because none of us have the motivation to. \n\nWhat do you think Reddit?", "created_utc": 1667587563, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym6wp0/wibta_for_telling_my_friend_they_cant_cook_at_my/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially when that gift brings more chores with it.", "NTA.  Your place (plus your clean-up), your call.", "Yeah I\u2019ve been picking up on obsessive vibes as well, I originally just thought it was cause I was one of their only close friends but now it\u2019s reached a point that it\u2019s making me uncomfortable.", "They use they/them pronouns.", "That\u2019s a great idea, thank you!", "Thank you, that\u2019s what I think would be fair as well.", "Then wouldn't \"IT\" make more sense or does this person have multiple personalities?", "It\u2019s just what they prefer man, trying to be respectful.", "Nta it isnt doing something nice when that person doesnt want it done.... like it can be until the point the person is like \"I appreciate the gesture but I actually dont want you to cook for me\". After that. Incistance makes you an asshole", "Just say no. It\u2019s a rough discussion, but you need to be honest with him.  The food is good but the mess he makes causes anxiety for all of you.  He can be an adult, accept the criticism and work on it, or he can try to continue to manipulate you.  You need to shut down the guilt tripping.", "NTA.  Are your housemates willing to take the fall here to spare your friendship?  Because \"they all outvoted me and said you can't come over and cook anymore, it's too delicious, we're all gaining weight\" seems like the best way out of this given how sensitive Eli is and that your friendship is more of you just being a really nice person in the first place.", "NTA. They won't host because it defeats the purpose of going to your place. They don't want the mess.", "NTA, if you can't tell the truth to your friend, this is not a good friendship to have.\n\nTell Eli not to come around anymore and that all the cooking that Eli wants to do will be done at Eli's residence.", "NTA. Your manipulative friend is manipulating you. It\u2019s not kindness if it leaves all of you worse off than if they didn\u2019t do it. The quality of frozen and fresh prepared food is amazing these days- healthy, tastes good, minimal prep and clean up. Eli is your worst option here.", "NAH.\n\nYou've done a good job of laying out the issues as you see them for a bunch of strangers on reddit.\n\nWhy not sit down with Eli and do the same thing?", "Eli is not going this *for* you, they\u2019re doing it *to* you.", "I\u2019ll have to talk to them about that, they might be willing to partially help me out with something like that, but I also don\u2019t wanna make it awkward for them when Eli comes around.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll react well to be honest. Strangers on Reddit have a much better sense of \u201copen communication\u201d than Eli does, which is saying a lot. But I think I\u2019m gonna have to be the bad guy in this situation and just put my foot down.", "Yes but then they wouldn't be able to duck out and leave you with the cleaning. I say drop this person. You say that they are intensely caring sometimes, but coupled with the other behavior you mentioned I would think it's more lovebombing to keep you around, rather than genuine consideration of you. \n\nYou'll probably get stuck cleaning their big ass mess even if you went over there. It would turn into \"well I invited you over to make you this amazing meal, the least you can do is help/make half of it/do all the dishes/some combo of those\".", "I have never heard of a friend moving to be closer to a friend. Maybe for a job in the area with friends that live there but not what Eli did.  Ask your bf and roommates to back you up when talking to Eli. How does Eli get in the house?", "They just walk in lol. They moved down here to be closer to me, but also to be in a more accepting area because they lived in conservative central where they couldn\u2019t come out as non-binary or feel comfortable expressing themselves.", "Fair enough but you can be respectful to him while not making it overly painful to read for the rest of us.  \n\nAnyway, back to the main point.  NTA.  Eli has no respect for your space and banning him/her/it is a wise move."]}
