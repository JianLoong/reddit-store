Who are you cutting off as well?", "NTA. Your brother is part of a family who supports him yet made a personal decision that resulted in his family losing a lot of money.  He made this decision despite being asked to reconsider and being warned of the potential consequences.  He chose to put himself first.  He knew his grandparent's views, it sounds like he just wanted to spite them.  The better way to spite them would have been to inherit $250K and donate it LGBTQ activism.  Now the result of his outing might make him feel good but he's basically f@@cked over his supportive family.  Well done.  Clap, clap clap.", "honestly\u2026. ima get attacked but nta (more like no one is an ass, except the grandparents of course) and i would be mortified. then again thats because im in a terrible financial situation so it\u2019s hard to see the value of money from others perspectives \u2026 regardless, i would be furious. are you around your grandparents a lot? there was little reason for him to tell them if you\u2019re not, he can live his life and be himself without their knowledge, screw them. it was foolish, and you are angry and that is understandable, but i wouldn\u2019t let it ruin your relationship with him!", "NTA - I don\u2019t care, downvote me. I sell my soul every day at work. I\u2019d be more than happy to make my sister uncomfortable at family outings for $250k.\n\n$250k would have in fact put your life in easy mode. That\u2019s a decent house bought and paid for or college paid for with money left over for a sizeable down payment after college. That fact that anyone whouldn\u2019t see this as an enormous and huge setup for a successful life is either, incredibly spoiled, an idiot, or a kid who doesn\u2019t realize how the world works.\n\nYour brother knowingly and intentionally ruined this chance for all 3 of you. Making a stand that confused 80+ year olds have to accept my lifestyle (that was ingrained as evil in their time) is downright stupid. Is their viewpoint acceptable in today\u2019s society? No. But they are old as hell, their grandfathers are the generation that finished off the Native Americans, what did you think they thought? (Bill Burr reference). 30 years ago, they would have been the normal in terms of viewpoints but times change for the better.\n\nI am not someone who believes they should wait around for loved ones to die for the sweet sweet insurance money. I have found that that is generally a bad idea and not a good way to lead your life long term. But 1-3 years for this bunch. Jesus christ, I can wait that long!
