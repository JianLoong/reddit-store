Accounting for those things, however, does not mean fully abstaining from doing the things a person enjoys--if that is the expectation, then the relationship is no good.

Maybe you weren\u2019t someone who really cares about stuff like that, but does your husband lean more towards fashion and that\u2019s why it\u2019s more relevant to him? \n\nIt\u2019s just something to consider for the future because if you end up marrying him, part of being married is compromising.
