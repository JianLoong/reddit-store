Accounting for those things, however, does not mean fully abstaining from doing the things a person enjoys--if that is the expectation, then the relationship is no good.

Maybe you weren\u2019t someone who really cares about stuff like that, but does your husband lean more towards fashion and that\u2019s why it\u2019s more relevant to him? \n\nIt\u2019s just something to consider for the future because if you end up marrying him, part of being married is compromising.

I recommend you leave, because this is highly concerning behavior and if he isn't outright abusive already then it may not be long until worse abuse comes. Controlling partners rarely stop at only a little bit of control. If you aren't being abused yet, then familiarize yourself with the different types of abuse and how they commonly manifest. My therapist told me when I was thinking about leaving to not leave because other people told me to leave. She said that if I leave for other people's reasons I would forever have regrets and what ifs. What if I did something different? What if I had loved him more? What if I had just obeyed what he wanted? She said that I needed to make the decision to leave on my own. I had to decide for myself how I would let him treat me, let him continue to treat me.

There is a need for compassion for each other, and it needs to go both ways. Being a dick about some pants is honestly just an expression of a human being behind in development, in the best of cases, or its just an asshole. You are NTA", "You don't owe him \"pretty.\"  If he likes you, he likes how you look no matter what. \n\nDon't listen to this dude, check out the downvotes.", "Just learned this in psych class. When someone intentionally withdraws like he did, especially to make a point,  it's an unhealthy relationship and some consider it a form of verbal abuse.", "My brother\u2019s wife has these hideous yellow sweatpants she wears for working around the house. He calls them her \u2018sexy pants\u2019 because as soon as he sees her wearing them, he wants her to take her pants off.", "Would love to see that lol. I want flame boots!!!!", "Marmcore!", "the most wholesome comment :)", "thats so sweet!! can you heat one up for me too??", "Yeah like... They aren't *flattering*.\n\nNobody else's ability to look at someone's arse is more important than that person's comfort.", "I'm stealing it for MY basic sweat pants and hoody look \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, I mean, it's a risky click on this sub sometimes, you know? The title seemed so innocent, and those are often the worst, lol.", "You sound like you might need help, and maybe some punctuation classes.", "He came in joggers for a date night where you'd be alone and mostly sitting and getting comfy watching somehting? Clever!  \nYou wore something appropriate for such a date, too and you really ask if you are the asshole? I'm sorry you feel like you could be. NTA, no.  \nBut, he on the other hand...  \nHe treated you shitty for no reason. Like, he mostly ignored you when seeing your jeans? He sounds like a child pouting bc he didn't get the toy he demanded.  \nEven if you hadn't invested more time and effort in your appearance than him he would have no right to be so salty about your looks.", "\"He was wearing a sweatshirt and joggers\"\n\nSo he's a hypocrite.  He's 'allowed' to wear comfortable clothes.  You're not.\n\n\"and did my hair and makeup to look presentable.\"\n\nThe only reason you should do your hair and makeup is because you want to.  Not to look 'presentable' by his or anyone else's standards.  Be hygienic sure, but your beauty is not tied to what hairstyle you have or your makeup routine. \n\nNTA, u/masmalls.  Your boyfriend is a controlling immature idiot.  My husband loves me just the same if I'm wearing jogging pants and tshirt with my hair in a simple ponytail or if I'm wearing a dress with makeup and my hair done.  Keep the jeans, lose the boyfriend.", "You need a better boyfriend. NTA", "she doesn\u2019t need to wear something he likes every time they see each other. he more than likely does not think about what she wants anytime he puts clothes on to see her, so why should she? and yes it makes him\u2026 a fucking asshole for being a child and ignoring her when she simply wore something he didn\u2019t think was flattering. that is asshole behavior. if you love your partner you let simple shit like this go, unless they are wearing something with holes, something stained or something inappropriate for where you\u2019re going. otherwise what your partner puts on their body is none of your business unless they ask.", "Sounds like a good plan to me! Sucks that your spouse doesn't find you appealing in sweats.", "I saw a pic of some of those dresses we wore and it *really* made me miss them!  lol", "Ms. Frizzle was the first thing that popped into my head, haha.", "I had a denim skirt back then and it wasn\u2019t even acid wash", "Flames...on the side...of my boots!", "My husband fell in love with me when I had the worst\\* haircut of my life and wore BDUs every day. He only ever saw me.  \n\\*bowl cut, with a line.", "Glad to hear he's an ex.", "as long as you don't mind if i eat it in your honor, absolutely!", "They probably are flattering. He just wants an excuse to exert control so that he can punish her noncompliance.", "This, exactly. If they say it without being asked, they are TA. I'd never say anything to my partner about what he's wearing or how it looks. If he's comfortable in it and likes to wear it, then that's what I prefer too.", "Nope. Men like the TA in the op are the ones who need help.  I was being a bit flippant saying I was jealous.", "i like ur comment. i think we as a society should boo meanies more often", "That sounds very close to shaming women for how they dress; As if their choice of clothing is soley chosen garner attention or get a reaction out of people. (Especially men)\n\n\"Were you wearing that dress at the bar to show off your clevage and get men to hit on you?\" \n\n\"Did you wear a suit instead of a dress to a formal event just to annoy homo/transphobes?\"\n\n\"Did you cut your hair just to spite your ex and show off that you are over them?\"\n\nClothes arn't always meant to make a big statement. Sometimes you just throw on what ever is clean and within reach because you just need to get dressed in somethong or just to laze around. People in generel wear and present how they want because it makes them feel secure.  Either with identity, comfort, self expression or sometimes personal reasons or inside jokes.\n\nShe already said she PRIMARILY wears skinny jeans but is growing out of them so these pants were available, fit and were comfterble and not just eye candy to be \"flattering\" for her Boyfriend to oggle or control what she wears. \n\nPlus she already answered you \n\n\"Not at all, I wore them purely for comfort.\"\n\nshe did NOT wear them to piss him off. That was just you jumping to conclusions on a trampoline and shaming her for nor being her boyfriends dress up doll.\n\nEven If she DID do it to it to get a rise out of him she still wouldn't be the asshole as she has every right to her own autonomy and he is just being controlling and abrasive for absolutely no reason at all.", "Partial comment stolen from u/dr-sparkle\n\nu/practsadgvh is a bot", "They were so comfortable.

He's in the shower atm but i gave him a big hug when he walked in. he said work was slow today", "Do people who occasionally bitch about bad traffic they often encounter have unresolved trauma?
