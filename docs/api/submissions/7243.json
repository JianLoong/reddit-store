I feel sad and excluded but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in the wrong here. \n\nI\u2019m the only family member/in law that is not involved in the wedding party, won\u2019t be in any photos, rehearsal dinner, or any other wedding events. \n\nMy (26F) fianc\u00e9 (26M) and I have been together for 10 years, we live close to his family (but not mine) and I thought we were all really close. \n\nHis sister (31) met someone a year ago and they\u2019re now planning a huge 80k wedding, mostly funded by my future in laws. \n\nI love my fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister like she is my own and I thought she felt the same about me. She is not close at all with my fianc\u00e9 or her other brother (25) because she has admittedly always been very competitive with them.\n\nShe was single for a long time and constantly had serious breakdowns over feeling like it was unfair that her brother had \u201cnever been single a day in his life\u201d since we got together so young. \n\nI\u2019ve always let her vent and tried to comfort her because I grew up in foster care and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is basically all I\u2019ve got. I reassured her she would be my maid of honor and that it would be a special day for her too. \n\nI was so excited for her when she got engaged. I was sad that I wasn\u2019t asked to be in the wedding party but whatever, I assumed that maybe they would just be having friends or something. \n\nInstead, she asked my fianc\u00e9 and his brother (he is single) and is having her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister, her husband, and husbands sister (three people she has never met) \n\nShe calls me all the time discussing her wedding and getting me to help her out, which I was glad to do. But she keeps making comments about how important family is and how she couldn\u2019t imagine not having her sil and her husband and his sister in the party. \n\nShe has her seating chart finished now and I am at a guest table with some extended relatives, I am not even at the table with my I. Laws, I\u2019m not going to be in any photos and I have to show up alone because ny fianc\u00e9 and his family are all getting ready at a hotel/staying there the night before. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is mad about all of this and doesn\u2019t want to be in the wedding at all, but I begged him to just let it go because it\u2019s her day and not about me. \n\nHowever, I am starting to feel like this whole thing was an intentional snub because his sister keeps seeming to rub it in my face that I am not involved at all yet am helping her with decorations and planning. \n\nAm I the asshole for taking this so personally and making it about me? Is SIL being an asshole or does she just not realize how this feels for me? Why would she be acting like this when I thought we were family? \n\nWIBTA if I just don\u2019t go and fake sick or something?", "created_utc": 1673632411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b0sa2/aita_for_being_upset_im_the_only_family_member/", "score": 902, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a really *awesome* fianc\u00e9 because he\u2019s standing up for you, but you\u2019re too humble to let him.\n\nStop helping his sister. Stop talking to her.

Stop helping her and when she calls for help, tell her talk to the people involved in the wedding . Your fianc\u00e9  has every right to be mad, to be angry, you shouldn't be excluded this much.   That isnt fair or right.", "Wow. I'm honestly at a loss here, because I'd be hurt and confused too...especially given how long you've been with your fiance and how close you say you are to her. I'm curious to see what others say. But no, NTA.", "NTA - this is weird. Maybe it\u2019s an oversight, and maybe it\u2019s an intentional slight. No way to know without asking.

Her response will be telling.\n\nAs an aside, regardless of how you feel about your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family, they are not your in-laws until you marry your fianc\u00e9.\n\nEdit - is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10b2wbi/aita_for_not_letting_my_brothers_gf_sit_with_us/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) the other side of the story?", "NTA. It would seem she's \"getting back\" at you for all the attention she feels that you got while being the person in a relationship all these years.

Decline to do anymore helping, deflect when asked anything, show up right on time to the ceremony, sit in the back, stay just as long as expected, then go to the hotel/home whenever it is social convenient. \n\nIf you do get so lucky to get married to your partner, don't involve her in the slightest, other than as a member of your family. Sit her with her husband/parents, and simply treat her politely and similarly to how she treated you, perhaps a step better (for forms sake). Don't invite her to a bachelorette, don't ask for any help AT ALL, don't give her a role in the wedding, and just smile and move on when you see her. \n\nKill her with kindness and aloofness, and you'll be free and clear morally and she won't be living rent free in your head.", "NTA It is weird, if everything you say about her relationships with her siblings is true. Sounds like she's using you. Stop helping her and suggest she ask her bridesmaids to do it, since family is so important and all.", "Absolutely NTA because you haven\u2019t actually done anything rash regarding your hurt feelings. But I do find it very rude and odd that she didn\u2019t invite you to be in the ceremony but has made it a point to have you help her with planning and such. Why aren\u2019t her MOH and bridesmaids the ones doing this? Honestly I would have just asked if there was any particular reason why she chose people she doesn\u2019t really know over you. Just be open about it but also non confrontational (as much as possible). Why wonder when you can just ask?", "NTA - You are not even seated with your fianc\u00e9 during the dinner? There has to be something more going on here and I doubt it has anything to do with you. Stop helping her with things - don't make a big deal of it, just start being too busy to help. Don't comment on the situation at all. I am guessing she is hoping you will make a fuss so can use that against you. For whatever reason she has decided to choose drama as a wedding theme. Just go along with whatever (accept helping her with anything) and don't make a peep. \n\nI guarantee people are going to be confused when they see you being left out at the wedding, since their family has known you for a decade.

This exclusion is definitely an intentional snub. I think you need to gracefully pull away from her and her wedding plans. She has an entire wedding party to help with the preparations.\n\nETA: I hope you don\u2019t make her your MOH either. If you don\u2019t merit even a place in her party or at the family table, she does not need a place of honor in your wedding. Stand up for yourself.", "Yeah it's a snub. I wouldn't get too broken up about not being in the actual wedding party proper, but seating you by yourself with distant relatives is intentional.\n\nNTA.", "Nah\n\n\nFirst it's her wedding party so she does get final say. That being said she needs to accept the consequences. \n\n\nSecond your fiancee has every right to back out if he wants to. Don't push him into doing something he isn't comfortable with\n\nFinally stop being a doormat.  Don't help her and don't discuss her wedding anymore.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the day it's her wedding. She is royally screwing up her family relationships.", "NTA but stop helping her, she doesn\u2019t deserve it, especially as you\u2019re not even invited to the rehearsal or sitting with your fianc\u00e9 at the reception. As your in-laws are paying, are they aware of this?", "Hold up, is this the same SIL that was in your post on r/relationship advice? I think you\u2019ve got your answer there as to why you\u2019ve been excluded. She is a still holding a grudge about that.", "NTA\n\nIt's strange and very rude that your SIL is wanting all this help from you without asking you to be a bridesmaid or even sitting you with your fianc\u00e9 at the wedding. \n\nI think what you need to do is ask her about this instead of faking an illness so you can't go. It is mean and thoughtless of her to expect your input but exclude you from everything you're helping her plan, and she really should know how you feel about this.", "Based on the past issue with your FMIL, your FSIL is punishing you for the boundaries that your fiancee set up during the home purchase. You need to support your guy and have him confront his family. She is not required to have you in her wedding party but he should be sitting with you during the wedding.\n\nNTA - however, you need to talk to your fiancee and solve this issue with his family.", "Stop helping!! Please stop helping her she\u2019s using you and rubbing your nose in the fact you aren\u2019t part of the wedding!!", "NTA. Stop setting yourself on fire to keep others warm. You are being treated unfairly despite doing a lot to help. She is allowed to have whoever she wants on her party, but you don\u2019t need to be a doormat so that you two can have a relationship.", "NTA! That's honestly bizarre and I am inclined to agree that she might have some reason for this. It sounds kind of intentional. That said, could your fianc\u00e9 not gently broach the subject without causing a big argument? Like, \"hey, I'm very excited for you but am kind of surprised that you completely left my partner out of all this, and I'm just curious if that was intentional?\"", "I think since your husband agrees that this is weird, that he should be the one to broach it to his sister - in a GENTLE and non-accusatory way.  Like, \u201cY\u2019know, with all the help OP is giving, I\u2019m surprised she isn\u2019t in the wedding party.\u201d  Or at the very least he needs to TELL HER that he insists that you sit with him at the reception.  Splitting up couples is just horrible.", "Don't get passive aggressive. Just ask her.", "NTA. It seems she does have something against you be it jealousy toward you or toward your fianc\u00e9.

I think that ultimately it was the correct choice given the groom had a complicated family structure and it meant nobody got left out.\n\nBased on how close you are to your SIL and how you're discussing it, I agree, it seems like she's rubbing your face in it and it might be that she's actually... not A Good Person. I've had some relationshippy trauma and it might be that you're not seeing the ways you're being mistreated. \n\nIf you're sure that's not the case then that's fine, but perhaps talk it over with your fiance and ask how he sees it, as he's likely to have been socialised in a similar way and will know if what's happening is Not Okay. \n\nJust to say as well, all wedding suck, the planning for them sucks, the evening sucks, get drunk and make your own fun.\n\nEdit: other commenter referred to the issues you're having with MIL. This is a calculated snub and manipulation. You are extremely unlikely to be able to change these people. Only answer the phone to your SIL if you don't think it's a conversation you will enjoy, don't invest literally anything into the wedding, don't give them an inch of yourself. Imagine big cold forcefield shields around yourself and sit back in your chair whenever you talk to her, even on the phone. Im so sorry it's happening like this but it sounds like you and your fiance are a good 'unit' and he's building himself, so make sure you're a team and work together to help growing", "If you guys are close enough that she calls you often and you talk a lot then maybe just have a frank discussion with her about how you feel. Tell her you feel left out and why.  Based on her reaction you will know whether or not to continue helping with all the decorations etc. or if you should just bow out of helping all together. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSIL is passive aggressively and intentionally making you feel \u201cless than\u201d.\n\nFor goodness sake STOP helping!\n\nNow go find some AITA posts from woman wondering if they\u2019re assholes for being upset when their BFs, fianc\u00e9es or husbands don\u2019t stand up for them.

You should just get your husband to ask what the deal is and yes, he should skip the event as well.  If it was just who is in the wedding it would be one thing, but the dinner seating is a definite snub.", "Why are you still friends with her?  Best case scenario is she is insensitive.  The seating of the reception is just a snub.  Worst case scenario, she is intentionally trying to hurt you.  Why are you helping her to hurt you?  You don\u2019t have to confront her.  Just be too busy to help her plan.  Don\u2019t plan any showers or bachelorette parties as that is the duty of the bridesmaids.  Avoid any bachelorette parties where she can hurt you.  Find better friends", "NTA Sometimes you gotta accept what it is and cut your lost. Stop helping her and doing everything that is related to the wedding. Every time she ask for help, just said you\u2019re not available for it.", "NTA, it is absolutely terrible wedding manners to seat an engaged couple apart. Also, any person who is invited to the rehearsal dinner should be allowed to bring their spouse or fianc\u00e9 as well. Not to mention how you are being treated as a friend. It sounds like she has some kind of issue with you or something.

Like, the siblings of the GROOM?\n\n\nI'm so confused, it sounds like it's actual siblings of the bride and groom that are in the wedding party.", "Nta at all. This seems intentional. Like she's trying to show she's better than you or something. But why are you still entertaining talk about the wedding? Either don't answer the calls/questions or say you don't want to help or talk about it. I wouldn't put myself through that when she's obviously doing it on purpose.", "INFO: Have you asked her why she's excluded you from this?", "YTA to yourself.  Stop helping her.  Stop being a doormat.  Personally, I would go and have a great time.  Life of the party stuff!", "NTA.  You have the right to feel the way you do.  I do find it strange that you weren't asked to be apart of the wedding party based on what you wrote about your relationship with you SIL.  It would be okay to ask your SIL why you were excluded from the wedding party and take it as feedback.  Anything more, let your fianc\u00e9 take it since it's his family.  You do need to know her reasons since you said that you wanted her as MOH on yours which looks like you may need to re-evaluate that decision.  It would be best to have as much information so you know where you stand in your relationship with SIL since you would be  planning your wedding and can act and defend your decisions accordingly.", "You sounds like a very kind and helpful person. She's lucky to have you in her life. However, YWBTA if you faked being sick, because it's very passive aggressive. Why can't you just say I don't want to go to the wedding because I have been helping out a lot and yet I'm not included or appreciated? As well, stop helping! Stop helping immediately. It sounds like it's only leading to your kindness being taken advantage of. As well, it sounds like you have a really good fiance in that he has your back but you told him to go to the wedding anyways so you kind of missed your opportunity at having him help mediate this situation. Finally, don't include her in your wedding, not because of paybacks, but it sounds like she's not a very considerate person. You don't need that kind of drama at your own wedding.

That's what her bridesmaids are for.", "NTA.  \n\nShe definitely is though aa she's using you as if you are in the wedding party but leaving you out of it. \n\nPlanned sickness would be the nicer way to not add drama but if it was me, I'd be more petty lol", "NTA. This seems to be a calculated thing to specifically keep you away from everyone and isolate you. Don't fake being sick, but be honest as to why you aren't going. You're being excluded from everything and would rather spend that \"alone time\" being with friends who want you around. Find some friends to hang out with that weekend and skip it.\n\nInfo: why can't you stay with your fiance at the hotel and sit with him at the wedding? What's stopping you from showing up and just hanging out while they all get ready?", "NAH. You are totally justified in your feelings. I also think she may not even be aware of what has happened in regards to you.\n\nThat being said, I've been in your shoes. One of my best friends got married years ago & I was the only friend not in her wedding party. She felt that I had abandoned her when I went to basic training - something I later found out - & decided that my abandonment warranted not being a part of the wedding. I took the advice of another friend about being the bigger person & went to the wedding anyway. I was miserable. I only knew my friends & they were all busy doing wedding party things. I was literally sitting in a chair at my table doing nothing. I think I stayed at the reception for 30 minutes and then left. \n\nI think you'd be justified not attending.", "INFO: Is this the same SIL from previous post?", "I applaud your fiance for supporting you by offering to stay away from the wedding. If you go and he is willing I think he should sit with you wherever you are at. \n\nFrom what you have written, the sister sounds like she has some issues. I doubt this will be the last time she causes trouble.  \"she has admittedly always been very competitive with them.\" This is only the beginning. NTA but you are now on guard against this sister.", "NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s her day. Let her have it.

You mentioned your SIL is competitive, could that somehow be at play here? It\u2019s clear she\u2019s intentionally excluding you, and you honestly shouldn\u2019t be dismissing your fianc\u00e9\u2019s feelings in the matter. If he\u2019s hurt and offended, that\u2019s a reasonable reaction. Telling him to let it go doesn\u2019t seem like the healthiest approach for all involved, it\u2019ll only give room for resentment. \n\nIt might help to have a talk with her, along with your fianc\u00e9, about the situation and your discomfort. Weddings are not some magical free pass to mistreat and disrespect others, so please do not play into that mindset.", "I am going ESH.\n\nI think the bride would be delighted if you did not go and stopped talking to her. I get the impression that she really does not like you much right now.\n\nThe only reason she is being \"nice\" to you at all is because it was the only way to get her brother/your boyfriend to be in her wedding. \n\nI dont know which side is deliberately trying to provoke the other into being TA, but it is dragging out to long to be completely one sided. \n\nESH because you are all are dragging it out because nobody  wants to be TA. Go no contact and make it stick. Everyone will call you TA. Or stick it out until sister explodes and kicks you both out of the wedding. Everyone will call her TA. Or maybe wait till mom oversteps boyfriends boundries again....she can be TA.\nOr boyfriend can be TA. But nobody wants to be TA.\n\nI think you should go extremely low contact with these people.

I guess she\u2019s jealous of your happy relationship???\nIt\u2019s unheard of and SUPER RUDE to invite her brother and not allow you - his fianc\u00e9e - to sit with him? \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 was right, suggesting he remove himself from the party. I mean sis should already respect you off rip. But disrespecting you is kind of like disrespecting her brother, because he loves you and chose you to be his wife and trusts you with his life, you know? Kind of like sis is disrespecting his judgment? \n\nThe point is if she\u2019s gonna mistreat you like this, your fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t go, as if he supports that.", "NTA.  I think the answer is in what you wrote: she's very competitive, she was single for a long time, and feels it's unfair that her brother had \u201cnever been single a day in his life since we got together so young\". and now she's getting married.  She is intentionally snubbing you because she feels like you've had one up on her for the past 10 years.  Now she's finally getting married and she's beating you to the altar.  This is 100% a snub and psychological manipulation.\n\nI'd start deflecting.  Those calls about her wedding (which are to rub your nose in the fact that she's getting married), yeah, you're busy now.  Don't answer, reject the call and send a short text later. \n\nThe wedding itself?  Well first your fiance sounds like a keeper, glad he recognizes this and is mad on your behalf.  Honestly I would find an excuse to be out of town for the wedding.  Business trip, concert out of town you wanted to see, hell even just a spa trip and tell her you won't be there.  I think if you tell her you can't go after all and downplay it, you'll get to the heart of her feelings.  \n\nMy sense from what you wrote is that you absolutely mean a ton to her, but that you're also in competition and she has to 'win' at getting married.  That's why she's snubbing you and seating you with the extended family.  She's gloating.  When you and your fiance get married, just make it a small affair without a best man or maid of honor.", "NTA \n\nStop helping her at all. Her bridal party is the one who should be helping her. Change the subject every time it\u2019s brought up or tell her to ask her bridal party or fianc\u00e9. \n\nTruthfully, I would reevaluate your friendship. You are not close to her.

Please don\u2019t make it about yourself and please don\u2019t make a scene. It will reflect very poorly on you. Be graceful, be the bigger person, enjoy the festivities, and if you truly love her as you say, try to be happy for her.", "Oh god this is a tough one. I\u2019m going NAH. I was about to say YTA, until I read the part about your future SIL including three people she\u2019s never met in the wedding party, which almost feels like your being excluded for some unknown reason. I can see why you are upset, but it\u2019s her wedding and her day, and she can do what she wants with that day. I think you should go and be civil and participate to avoid making it about you by boycotting, but can see how this would be an awkward social situation for you. So NAH", "NAH - the optics don't look good but it is her day and best if you just go along.  You can decide how you want to handle when you get married to her wonderful brother.", "Info: have you been told you're not invited to any of the other wedding events?\n\nShowers are a gift grab, they generally want as many people at them as possible. The rehearsal isn't usually just about the wedding party, its both family's the wedding party and their partners which would include you. If you have been outright told you aren't welcome then you're very obviously being snubbed. Otherwise maybe she's just trying to build a relationship with her soon to be husband's family so she included them over you someone she already has a relationship with. \n\nAs for the seating chart, is it possible that the table with your inlaws was simply full and since your fiance is going to be in the wedding party and would obviously be sitting with the wedding party it kakes sense you wouldn't be seated together.", "I think honestly if your not married it\u2019s not in law yet.\n\nBut I would set a boundary of not helping her with her wedding preparations. You are a guest only.\n\nAnd she shouldnt be your maid of honor", "You sister in law isn't trying to be an asshole. From what you say here everyone else partaking in wedding party stuff is either a blood sibling of hers or the grooms or a siblings spouse. You may be engaged but you're not married yet and in terms of drawing a line with wedding parties where numbers need to be even they have to decide where that line is. Being married is a common one. \n\nBe honest about your feelings without demanding anything. It won't change anything but simply asking why without entitlement or your fiance's ire.

I get that after 10 years, this is your family; she may not see it quite the same.\n\nI completely get why it sucks feeling left out and away from your in-laws and that is a fair shake that you would want to sit with your family.", "Hmmm\u2026I don\u2019t think YTA, but I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s a deliberate slight either. You\u2019re entitled to your feelings, you\u2019re entitled not to go to the wedding if you do choose, but I wouldn\u2019t start a brouhaha over it.

I feel sad and excluded but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m in the wrong here. \n\nI\u2019m the only family member/in law that is not involved in the wedding party, won\u2019t be in any photos, rehearsal dinner, or any other wedding events. \n\nMy (26F) fianc\u00e9 (26M) and I have been together for 10 years, we live close to his family (but not mine) and I thought we were all really close. \n\nHis sister (31) met someone a year ago and they\u2019re now planning a huge 80k wedding, mostly funded by my future in laws. \n\nI love my fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister like she is my own and I thought she felt the same about me. She is not close at all with my fianc\u00e9 or her other brother (25) because she has admittedly always been very competitive with them.\n\nShe was single for a long time and constantly had serious breakdowns over feeling like it was unfair that her brother had \u201cnever been single a day in his life\u201d since we got together so young. \n\nI\u2019ve always let her vent and tried to comfort her because I grew up in foster care and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family is basically all I\u2019ve got. I reassured her she would be my maid of honor and that it would be a special day for her too. \n\nI was so excited for her when she got engaged. I was sad that I wasn\u2019t asked to be in the wedding party but whatever, I assumed that maybe they would just be having friends or something. \n\nInstead, she asked my fianc\u00e9 and his brother (he is single) and is having her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister, her husband, and husbands sister (three people she has never met) \n\nShe calls me all the time discussing her wedding and getting me to help her out, which I was glad to do. But she keeps making comments about how important family is and how she couldn\u2019t imagine not having her sil and her husband and his sister in the party. \n\nShe has her seating chart finished now and I am at a guest table with some extended relatives, I am not even at the table with my I. Laws, I\u2019m not going to be in any photos and I have to show up alone because ny fianc\u00e9 and his family are all getting ready at a hotel/staying there the night before. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 is mad about all of this and doesn\u2019t want to be in the wedding at all, but I begged him to just let it go because it\u2019s her day and not about me. \n\nHowever, I am starting to feel like this whole thing was an intentional snub because his sister keeps seeming to rub it in my face that I am not involved at all yet am helping her with decorations and planning. \n\nAm I the asshole for taking this so personally and making it about me? Is SIL being an asshole or does she just not realize how this feels for me? Why would she be acting like this when I thought we were family? \n\nWIBTA if I just don\u2019t go and fake sick or something?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA at all for not going. But don't fake sick, just tell her why. And stop helping her with wedding stuff! It's SUPER insulting to be asked to help with all the wedding things, then have your 10-year relationship fiance in the wedding forcing you to attend alone and then not even seating you together! Just wow. She obviously doesn't consider you family", "Why haven't you asked her? It doesn't seem like it would have been out of place to tell her you thought you were close enough to be included and feel hurt. No demanding to be included, just asking so know what kind of relationship you really have.", "NTA. Drop the phone calls and make some fun plans for the day. Since your fiance's family is high drama, there are going to be fights and drama, probably even on the wedding day. With your tender heart, this is the last place you want to be.", "NTA. I would step back from helping with the wedding. Clearly she doesn\u2019t view you two as having a close relationship as you say. I wouldn\u2019t be okay with some stuff and would have my finance back me. I absolutely would be spending the night with my fianc\u00e9 the night before the wedding. Everyone is an adult therefore will have their own hotel rooms. He will just have to go early to get ready with the groom. I also would insist on sitting with my husband for the reception. I would make it my hill to die on if I am seated at a table with strangers (not wedding party +1s) but if the answer is no then I\u2019d decline the invite, leave after the ceremony. If everyone else\u2019s +1s in the wedding party are sitting together and you\u2019re excluded, it\u2019s time to call it like it is and be honest that you aren\u2019t wanted by the bride.", "You're not family. You're the ten year engagement chick. That's why you're not in the wedding. Be angry at your \"fiance\", not his sister. Very soft YTA for blaming the wrong person for this.", "Stop taking her calls and helping out with the wedding. If she needs help just tell her that is what the MOH and bridesmaids are for. \n\nLet your fiancee back out of the wedding, he is trying to take a stand with his family and let them know he will not allow them to treat you like this. Let him.\n\nIn regard to your own wedding, do NOT make her the MOH or let her know any details about the wedding. I have a feeling that she will try to sabotage the wedding. Place her and her parents at a table in the back of the room near the kitchen (or the dj speakers).", "Let's back it up a minute here:\n\n> Instead, she asked my fianc\u00e9 and his brother (he is single) and is having her fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister, her husband, and husbands sister (three people she has never met)\n\nHer brother, her other brother, fiance's sister, his brother in law and his sister in law.  \n\nYou say she hasn't met those three people but obviously her fiance has.  They are his family.  These are all family members, by blood or marriage.  \n\n> I am not even at the table with my I. Laws\n\nYou are not married.  They are not yet your in-laws.\n\nHow I see it is they invited some direct family to join.  The three family members she \"hasn't met\" are probably at the behest of the groom.  Her brothers, well that's clear. \n\nI wouldn't be super upset about it.  I wouldn't be making a stink about the wedding party to the point where your fiancee wants to not go. \n\nIf you don't want to help her, don't help her.  \n\nI think maybe the appropriate thing here would've been your husband saying \"my fiancee has been around a long time and I think it would be a good idea to seat her in the family area or the more direct family area.\n\nAt the end of the day, I think getting mad about who is or isn't included in a wedding party is a rough one.  \n\nIt's not like a gaggle of friends and your the one from the group chat not included.  It's family, with a wedding party of family.  And you aren't married into the family yet.", "Thanks for this comment.. I really needed to hear that I don\u2019t have to go. \n\nSil and the entire family have had so many dramas and it was at times constant fighting between them all, but I just.. I just want them to love me, I want my sil to love me like a sister as stupid as it probably sounds. \n\nI really wanted to be involved and I was excited to help her and discuss the whole thing since it\u2019s been all anyone has talked about all year, and we can\u2019t afford to ever have a wedding this extravagant. \n\nThe thought of going to this wedding is just making me panic and feel like a sad kid again, and I thought I was just being selfish and dramatic but I am so goddamn worried I\u2019m going to cry at the wedding and cause a scene. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do that. I\u2019m also really worried that if I go I\u2019m going to be blamed for ruining it, but if I don\u2019t go I\u2019m also going to be blamed. \n\nI wish I could go into a coma for wedding month.", "We haven\u2019t set a wedding date because we are still saving up, but I asked her a couple years ago when we got engaged if she would be my MOH and she said yes.

This is why it\u2019s so confusing - she calls me and talks to me for hours at a time on the weekends or during her commute, I\u2019ve been super excited for her and talking about her wedding but lately it seems like she\u2019s sort of.. bullying me I guess? I don\u2019t understand. \n\nI\u2019ve asked my mil gently if sil is upset with me or anything and she said no, why would I think that? I said that I felt sort of awkward to not be involved in the wedding party and I hoped I didn\u2019t hurt my SILs feelings or do something to cause it, and my mil said that it\u2019s just because sil has so many friends she has to include. \n\nBut she isn\u2019t including that many friends and has complained to me that the friends she did pick aren\u2019t that close to her. I jokingly said \u201cwell, you can always pick me because I\u2019ll hopefully be around for life lol\u201d and she just ignored it.", "Yes this is great advice. Depending on the response as to seating arrangements, you should decide whether you really want to be helping with the wedding. NTA.", "It's kinda strange that OP doesn't understand that her fiance would like to be with her during a wedding. I would never accept an invite to a wedding where I'm expected to be without my significant other, when everybody else is with their SO\n\nDoes the bride want to brake them up?", "Good spot!", "Yes, it is. I changed some details in that post so that hopefully no one irl finds my posts. But I ended up (trying anyway) to fix things between my fianc\u00e9, his mom, and sister. And I convinced my fianc\u00e9 to say yes to being in the wedding party, he started speaking to his family again, etc. my sil was really happy that I \u201cfixed things\u201d and I thought that maybe she would see how much I care about her and the family if I tried to get us all on the same page again. \n\nThere was a lot more to it because after she blamed and my fianc\u00e9 she instead started blaming MIL and FIL and then they tried to cut her off\u2026 so I ended up being a shoulder for her to cry on and she told me I \u201cliterally saved her life\u201d and that she knew I would save the day etc etc. \n\nJust really complicated I know.", "Exactly this. After reading her other post, SIL is punishing her brother by punishing you. I would suggest backing off from the entire thing, don\u2019t plan on attending and let your BF decide his own relationship with his family. His family sounds very manipulative from the posts and you need to let your BF decide what he wants to do.", "I agree, I had a similar situation happen at my BILs wedding, I was split from my fiance because he was in the wedding party, but I was at least sat with friends/people I got along with. OPs fiance should broach it in a gentle non-accusatory way, especially because you're helping in other ways. Insisting to sit with they sit together at the reception may be a bit much, but at the very least fiance should be insisting OP sit with someone OP knows better than vague extended family since OP is helping with the wedding. (Or OP should just stop helping with the wedding.)", "I agree my brother in law was in my wedding party and I was not in his.

Plus, I got married to her brother 3 months before her wedding, and she was a bridesmaid and her now husband was an usher. I was just a nobody for her wedding, while she included her husband\u2019s sister in law who she used to cry to everyone about because she was so mean to her. Whatever. Totally understand how you\u2019re feeling and sending hugs.", "Since you are a former foster child, I\u2019m going to start with something that you desperately need to hear before we get to the heart of the matter. \n\nNOTHING that happened to you was your fault. YOU ARE JUST AS WORTHY AND DESERVING OF LOVE AND HAPPINESS AS EVERYONE ELSE.  You are clearly a wonderful person and you deserve love and respect and reciprocation. YOU DO NOT NEED TO EARN LOVE. You are already worth loving. <3\n\nUnfortunately, some people take advantage of people who don\u2019t know their worth or who are desperate for friends and family. Your SIL is just as competitive with you as she is with her brothers and always has been. Worrying that you and her brother will beat her to marriage or kids is a sure sign that she\u2019s competitive with you. This means that she\u2019s never really seen you as her friend. I think that if you think about how close you\u2019ve been you might find that it was an unhealthy dynamic. When she came to you with her problems, were you able to go to her with yours? Have you ever cried on her shoulder or vented to her or is it a one way street? She sounds selfish and I suspect that her friendship with you has been a way to one up her brother with a good dose of taking advantage of someone desperate to be loved and welcomed. \n\nNow that she\u2019s planning her dream wedding her true feelings are showing themselves (though I also suspect they\u2019ve always been visible) and her treatment of you is getting harder to rationalize to yourself as BFF behavior because of the formal wedding roles. You are talking to her for hours about her wedding, helping her plan it, and sitting out of sight?!? There\u2019s very good reason this doesn\u2019t sit right with you. Frankly, it shouldn\u2019t. That\u2019s your self respect there and you should listen to it. \n\nIf you want to try to keep the peace, I recommend being direct with her that you feel hurt and left out. Don\u2019t apologize and don\u2019t yell. Something along the lines of \u201cI\u2019m so happy for your big day, but I don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m not in the wedding party. I thought we were close friends and that I would be a bridesmaid for you as you will be for me.\u201d  Just be direct, don\u2019t be passive or hope that she\u2019ll know how you feel because that will be ignored. See what she says and use that information for how you want to proceed with your relationship. If you are direct and firm with her, she may end up admitting what a user she is and that can at least make you feel less crazy. \n\nIf you don\u2019t feel strong enough to be direct with her, you should just plan to go LC. She\u2019s never going to love you like a sister. I agree with most other recommendations here about not helping her anymore, not being her sounding board, etc. I do think that your fianc\u00e9e is right to be outraged at your exclusion. You can let him protest your treatment and you two can elope during her wedding or he can step down as a groomsman and sit with you all night or you two can fake horrible food poisoning day of to avoid the drama. \n\nFinal note. An $80k wedding is ridiculous. Don\u2019t be jealous of her wedding compared to yours. It\u2019s unfair that his parents are shelling that much for her but not him but that\u2019s a separate issue (screams she\u2019s the golden child though). Think about it like this. Statistics show that the more expensive the wedding, the more likely the divorce. I had a $30k wedding and a $120 courthouse wedding and I can tell you I was so so so much happier at the courthouse with the man that is unquestionably the love of my life, my BFF, my partner in crime, etc. The $30k wedding was an amazing experience but it only lasted a few hours and all that money is gone and in hindsight it wasn\u2019t even remotely worth it even if we\u2019d stayed together.", "YWNBTA If you\u2019re as close to her as you think you are, then reach out and talk to her.

She will be bored and, most importantly, SIL consciously put her in that situation since all the other couples have been put close/doing something near. \n\nIn my opinion, if OP is treated like a far relative, it means she can act as such.

Sit her with her husband/parents, and simply treat her politely and similarly to how she treated you, perhaps a step better (for forms sake). Don't invite her to a bachelorette, don't ask for any help AT ALL, don't give her a role in the wedding, and just smile and move on when you see her.Kill her with kindness and aloofness, and you'll be free and clear morally and she won't be living rent free in your head.\n\nThis really is the best answer. OP, please beware of folks trying to get you to cause drama over this. Do not skip the wedding. Do not tell your fianc\u00e9 to go in there and ask why you aren't included. It's enough that he knows it's wrong and is supportive of you. Here's how I'd play it.\n\n(1) Low contact with the SIL. Next time she calls/texts about the wedding \"don't you want to figure this out with your bridesmaids?\" and subsequent times just say \"oh I don't know! Whatever you think sounds great.\" or something equally \"gray rock.\" Wear a dress you already own, just treat it like a business event and text with a friend on your phone under the table during the toasts if it feels too emotional for you being excluded.\n\n(2) Be perfectly polite and nothing more. Enjoy getting to know the distant relatives, they may be the coolest members of your future in-law family!\n\n(3) Plan something nice for you and fianc\u00e9. And most definitely elope. When you get back tell your in-laws if they want to host a reception for their family you'd be honored, but you really just wanted something private and low-key.\n\n(4) Emotionally detach from this family. You and your fianc\u00e9 can be involved up to a point (once a month dinners and holidays?) but you need your own emotional support network of people who actually care about you. Friends? \n\nGood luck. Again, do not under any circumstances cause more drama about this. Your feelings are 100% valid. Absolutely!!! But talk it through with a counselor.

Maybe if there\u2019s a conversation, you\u2019ll learn something you missed. Who knows, but having a conversation is the only way to figure that out.\n\nAnd if you do have that conversation, I\u2019d encourage \u201cI\u201d and \u201cme\u201d statements.

Think of it more like going to a business dinner with your fianc\u00e9 or going out with some friends of his from before he knew you. It might be a little uncomfortable or not what you\u2019d prefer to do, but you do it because you love your fianc\u00e9, not because you like the other people.

But don\u2019t let these people steal a moment from you IF you want it", "I would say your feelings are valid in that worry. Also stop helping her, and when she asks why tell her that you started looking into planning your wedding. She doesn't need to know that she's getting to you unless you want to tell her off.   \n\nSo you do YOUR day how you want & fuck em.

These people delight in making other people feel bad, and you should not waste any more time trying to get them to like you or to make them happy. \n\nThe reason you\u2019re questioning your own reasoning is because they\u2019re gaslighting you and that is the sole purpose of gaslighting. You are mistaken that the SIL isn\u2019t competitive with you and are solidly in her crosshairs. \n\nI think you should elope because otherwise they will find a way to ruin your wedding, and do it while they\u2019re all preoccupied with SILs wedding. Weddings are not pageants or productions, they are a celebration of a union of families. I don\u2019t think joining the rest of the family is much to celebrate, so an elopement is entirely appropriate.", "Why are you heartbroken that some narcissistic ahole doesn\u2019t pay attention to you?", "She is literally only getting married to \u201cbeat you to the altar\u201d. She\u2019s a hot mess of an asshole.", "She didn't warmed up to you. She's an hypocrite I'm sorry to say that. How come she always come to you and cry her eyes off, use you to plan her wedding and place you on the table of guests ? And you really think she'll love. I'm pretty sure she's using you to upset her brother and to show how she's the princess of the house. I hate fake people", "I think it's referring to you. And that's bullshit. You are being blamed and punished for your fiance setting boundaries with his mother. \n\nAs hard as it is, I think the thing to do here is give them zero indication that anything they say or do is hurting you. Whatever settings you are in together, channel all your strength into seeming carefree and completely unbothered. Your in laws are being really ugly, and I think they are enjoying your heartache, as disgusting and sad as that is.", "You\u2019re just an object to her, something she can use and abuse. Sounds like a narcissist.  Avoid narcissists.", "Yep, it's 100% deliberate and mean spirited. (In my case, I was a wife.) And it is 100% the type of thing other guests will notice and make note of.", "I love this answer. This is the way.", "I think you should keep in mind you DO have true family. Your fiance seems like a really great dude who is always on your team, from what you've said. I think you guys should focus on that family, with the two of you - maybe invite the other brother out to stuff with you guys, too, if he's similarly shunted to the side by the rest of them. You have family who really loves you, and that's wonderful.", "I really think they should just elope and forget about the rest of his family.  If they don't have a wedding,  then they could have a fabulous honeymoon.\n\nWhen mom complains about the elopement,  her fiance could say \"but mom,  I didn't think you were interested in welcoming OP to the family since you didn't do anything when sis went out of her way to snub her at her wedding\".  He also needs to tell them that the elopement is HIS idea, and if they don't accept her as part of the family then he isn't part of it either.", "Oh my God, I LOVE this!", "I love this phrase.", "The migraine is great advice! Go to the ceremony and fake sick and go back home. Put on your PJs, make some snacks, flip on a show, and ENJOY a drama-free evening to celebrate your escape from this woman. \n\nI agree you should stop helping her and taking her calls, but still be polite and make an excuse (imo) to save face for future.\n\nAin\u2019t nobody got time for that!", "This is a good idea too. I was going to say invite the parents but nope.", "NTA to not go and Yes! Therapy. I would guess your feelings are coming through hard because of childhood trauma and abandonment with being in foster care. Dream families aren't a thing from the inside. As you said there is drama around. You let your Fiance manage his family. You work with therapy on boundaries, what a healthy family dynamic looks like, and knowing you are worthy. None of us should pin our self-worth on someone else's validation. That shit comes from within.

So far I\u2019ve helped her pick out a lot of stuff and I\u2019ve gushed nonstop about how beautiful her dress is, the venue, her themes etc etc. It really hurts my heart that she doesn\u2019t care for me the way I do for her. \n\nAnd her wedding actually is going to be really beautiful!

I share your view on this.\n\nAnyone that has the audacity to disrespect you, devalue you, tries to tear you down and destroy your self-worth and then tries to kick you when you\u2019re down- show them where the door is, and don\u2019t let it hit them on the way out.\n\nWe all have so much more power than we know. We are all worthy of love and respect and should never let anyone else take that away from us, not even someone related by marriage, not even someone that is related to us by flesh and blood.\n\nNo one has the right to take that power away no matter who they are. We have to stand up for ourselves even when there is no one else in our lives that will stand up for us, and if that destroys the peace, so be it.\n\nSometimes, this is what it takes stand up for yourself and to demand the respect you should never have to ask or beg for.", "Because I\u2019ve known her for a decade and even though she has had some awful moments, I thought we were family and that we\u2019d be in each others lives forever.

It makes me feel like I\u2019m paranoid and it\u2019s worse than them just outright being rude to me because if I bring it up they deny it and act like I\u2019m crazy.", "I just want to say that you seem like a really lovely person and I wish you (and OP) great things in life \ud83d\udc96", "When I got married, I had all my siblings and their partners (not married) in my party. I absolutely did not want to exclude anyone so it was doubly hurtful when they excluded me. They kept saying \u2018it\u2019s all about family\u2019 when clearly it wasn\u2019t. Don\u2019t know why they did it, but I\u2019ve moved on. But I haven\u2019t forgotten it either. My wedding was lovely all around, but so expensive (we paid on our own) that I wish we eloped and had a party to celebrate later. Don\u2019t feel like you have to do anything you don\u2019t want to in the name of \u2018family\u2019 or \u2018being the bigger person\u2019.

Hopefully OP will consider this. I think this would be a lovely elopement if they did something like this. \n\nI\u2019m just gushing over the idea of a wedding with just the bride and the groom and their officiant (and maybe photographer) with no one else to ruin their moment. \ud83d\ude0d", "It\u2019s not autocorrect, it\u2019s to evade the sub rules banning covid-19", "Oh that's a thing that came up on TikTok ages ago, so probably intentional vs autocorrect", "Old Reddit saying:\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make someone love you by giving them more of something they already don\u2019t appreciate.\u201d\n\nStop doing things for her hoping it will make her like and appreciate you.

With most people, that is the case where it takes two people to cause an issue. It is not the case with abusive people, people who take pleasure in making others feel small, or those who\u2019s pride and ego take precedence over all. \n\nYou want to believe people are good and if you could just understand their perspective it would make sense. But sometimes people aren\u2019t, and their perspective is abhorrent. \n\nI did this same thing with my parents for years until I went to therapy and learned that I deserve to be treated with kindness and respect in the same way I treat other people. You deserve that too. You are deserving of people who cherish you and want to be your friend.", "You need to take a step back from the wedding planning and from her. It's not healthy for you and she's made her point clear. She wants to use you and keep you for her own emotional validation.
