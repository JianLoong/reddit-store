I\u2019d have done exactly the same", "NTA. What else were you supposed to do?", "NTA.

Any time someone behaves as if you are the parent, having to hand out chores and reminding people that moldy plates are bad, whether it's a partner or a flatmate, that's a good sign the relationship is not good.", "NTA, she was too gross to live with, she moved out, problem solved. Lucky she did not fight you about it.", "NTA - if you share a space with someone, you should be prepared to clean up after yourself. Struggling with depression can make it harder to have the energy or motivation to do that, but it's okay for you to set clear boundaries and expect your roommate to respect them.", "NTA.", "NTA   You\u2019ve talked to her several times about it. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t like you didn\u2019t give her a reasonable chance. I would definitely make sure to follow your local regulations on notice and making sure it\u2019s documented otherwise you could end up with her stretching this out in court while not paying rent, etc.  \ndocument document document and follow the rules to the letter. \nI once found out that an exact phrase in a certain font size and bold letters was required to send an official demand letter regarding a real estate transaction. Without that phrase they could have not provided the payoff info and left me holding the bag for the extra costs.", "INFO I\u2019m confused. How did you get to decide to kick her out? Were you unofficially subletting the place you rent? Or did the landlord kick her out after you complained?", "NTA. I'm feeling a lot of rage on your behalf lol You have a DISHWASHER and she still can't do her dishes?? Moldy dishes are going to attract bugs/vermin. This person just has a fundamentally different level of acceptable cleanliness than you do. You're always going to be stressed living with them, so might as well get it over with quickly. (I will say though, Idk where you live but 2 weeks doesn't seem like  enough time to find a new apt...)\n\nI've lived in my 3 bedroom apt for over 12 years and have had a bunch of different roommates. During the interview process I always ask them specific questions about cleanliness to see if we're on the same page.", "INFO:\n\nThere is not enough information here. Was she added to the lease? What are the laws in your area when it comes to notice?", "Info: are you also the landlord or are you subletting to her?", "NTA.  I lived with a roommate for 2 years whom I acted as a mother to. All the cooking, cleaning, and laundry were always on me. She was my good friend, so I didn't want to create conflicts, but it was a relief when she moved out. You should be glad that you don\u2019t live with her anymore.", "NTA, she was disrespectful and needed to go. You weren't compatible as roommates.\n\nI wish I had done the same sooner with my former roommate.", "NTA at all...you gave her a number of chances and spelled out what was expected. I'd consider yourself lucky she moved out after those 2 weeks without a legal challenge or other shenanigans. \nBut you had to do what you had to do.", "ESH\n\nYou have a reasonable right to cleanliness and housekeeping especially in a shared environment. If the person can\u2019t clean after themselves then it\u2019s not a healthy environment and housekeeping issues can cause health issues. \n\nNote, two weeks notice may not be sufficient notice in New York for a month to month lease. Should you choose to rent that room out in the future be sure to check into landlord tenant laws to ensure you are covering your ass. Failure to provide adequate notice can result in legal action against you from a future tenant. Don\u2019t make landlord decisions when you\u2019re heated, even if you are in the right you could still become viral as the \u201chot headed landlord\u201d. After the fact, you can send written notice to terminate the lease and remain fully professional. \n\n[NY Tenants Rights](https://www.nyc.gov/assets/buildings/pdf/tenants_rights.pdf)", "She stays past 30 days and you\u2019ll have to evict. \n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Legally OP should have gone through the eviction process. In CA where I live that would have required 30 day notice. If roommate still refused to move out after 30 days, OP would have had to go to court to get an order of eviction. Courts are still incredibly backed up here due to covid so that could have taken months. Any mistake in OP\u2019s 30 day notice or court filing could have made her have to start the process all over. If roommate still refused to budge after a court order, OP would have had to get law enforcement involved to enforce it.", "I reread your story and I need to add that while I am TOTALLY with you and would have been just as angry, banging on her door and waking her up to yell at her was not a good way to handle things.

First thing I do is send an email with some get-to-know-you type questions, which include some about cleaning/cleanliness preference.
