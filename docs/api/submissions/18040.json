It went smoothly and I met a single mom (23f) with a son around my boys age so we started talking and set up play dates. She lived with her parents so she wanted to have playdates at my house or at a park which was totally fine. Our boys got along great and it was really sweet. My husband was always a part of the play dates or around the house when they came by and he enjoyed the occasional conversation.\n\nShe started looking for a bf and talking to guys (no problem there, do you boo-boo) and found a guy who adored both her and her son. That sounded like a win in my book! The next time she came over for a play date and dinner, something seemed off. She barely spoke to me even when I initiated a conversation. My husband comes out of our room to sit down and watch the kids play and she immediately started talking to him about this that and everything. If he\u2019d been going to the gym, how his day has been, how work was. I figured it was normal conversation topics and didn\u2019t think much of it until she started following him around the house everywhere he went. He moved to the dining room, she followed. He went to the bathroom, she waited outside the door. He finally went and sat in his gaming area while I was sitting in the living room with her eating and she moved to go sit basically at his feet. She then got a call from the guy she was talking to and she rushed out the door with her son.\n\nMy husband told me he felt very uncomfortable with the whole night and asked me to no longer have play dates when he is around (so no play dates at home and it will just be me, her, and the kids). \n\nWe had planned to go to the zoo but my husband didn\u2019t want to go anymore and my son wanted to stay with his dad and I didn\u2019t want to cancel last minute so I went to the zoo with her and her son. I bought her son a stuffed animal and we all fed the giraffes and waited to see the live show. The only time she talked to me was to ask about my husband (not even myself or my son) so I told her the truth that the other night made him uncomfortable and he has requested to be left out of playdates. She simply shrugged and said she had to go so we ended the zoo date and went our separate ways. That night I get a message at 3am from her saying I was an AH and a horrible friend and to enjoy my time in hell then blocked me on everything.\n\nAITA for telling her she made my husband uncomfortable? What should I have done instead?\n\n\nEdit 1: We had a total of five play dates spread out over four months and my husband would play with both boys at the park or at home so neither one felt left out. We had a few girls days where we went out and ran errands or went to eat. Her and I talked everyday but mostly about our days or the kids. We had a good friendship going so I don\u2019t understand how it went under so fast\n\nEdit 2: My comments are disappearing so I will add this here. I never met the guy she was talking to but she had a picture of him and told me about her first date when it happened. It was at her parents house and supposedly went well. She asked me if I could watch her son the weekend after the zoo date so she could go on a second date with him (seeing as she blocked me on everything the night of the zoo date, watching her son didn\u2019t happen). I realize she could have made him up and used fake pictures but I don\u2019t know what that would have accomplished?", "created_utc": 1684882417, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q3mlb/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_she_was_making_my/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was crossing the line and what about the guy she was gushing about that adored her and her son? Had you ever seen a picture of him or anything? If not, I have a sneaking suspicion that she was talking about your husband.", "NTA\n\nThe new boundaries are in response to her behavior towards your husband. Her saying otherwise is her playing victim, and trying to shift blame. But, as a few others have stated I'd be concerned as the cause of this shift in behavior (extra attention towards your husband, and not wanting to be around you.)", "Be alert...

I can see a fatal attraction thing happening.", "Nta for telling her.\n\nHonestly, you should have been the one pulling the plug on that friendship. She was crossing boundaries and not even being discret about it. She made your husband uncomfortable in his own home, and him telling you that he didn't want to be around her should have been your cue to cut ties too. She was being disrespectful of your marriage, and the appropriate response is to draw a clear line. Your husband did, you didn't. \n\nAs for her response, her inappropriate behavior was acknowledged and she got defensive and lashed out to because she knows she doesn't have a valid excuse.\n\nPersonally, I don't suspect cheating from your husband based on the info from this post. I think a cheater would have pushed for you to not talk to her and even block her. Unless your husband as given another reason to suspect cheating.", "NTA. And she did you the favor of blocking you. There is something up in her behavior at your home and after talking to her. Be glad the woman is gone.", "NTA. Don't buy a pet rabbit anytime soon", "What a strange set of circumstances. I would say no idk what her end goal was.", "NTA\n\nFrom your story, it sounds like there's some piece of information missing here but it's not information that you know. It sounds like something is going on in your friend's life but unless she's willing to communicate that problem in a mature way you're not obligated to take that into consideration.", "NTA... She sounds unhinged. You are better off not having her around. Sorry for the boys.", "She sounds like a fucking maniac. It sounds like she made this dude up and was obsessed with your husband. Fucking creepy as hell. NTA, this is how horror movies start", "NTA because you did and said nothing wrong, but I have no insight on what could possibly be going on with the play date friend because how she acted with your husband was totally weird, how she started acting with you was even weirder and the message she sent at 3AM was the weirdest thing of all. I'm stumped. But I do know, given her behavior, that she did you a HUGE favor by basically \"unfriending\" you so don't lose anymore sleep over this situation or her. You're adults and mothers so you don't have time for immature behaviors and childish antics; let her be someone else's problem (pretty sure she has a problem making and keeping friends as well as getting and keeping boyfriends/mates LOL)", "NTA.", "NTA. What bizarre behavior. The only thing I can kind of imagine is if she and your husband were running around behind your back, maybe this makes more sense in the context of she\u2019s trying to show off in front of the two of you to get him to leave you.", "NTA.  Are you sure your husband is being truthful?  I don't know many women who would act that way without a reason.\n\nThat or she's a psycho stalker and scary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
