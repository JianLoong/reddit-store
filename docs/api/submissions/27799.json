It would be reasonable for him to avoid extended uses of the bathroom during the only times of day you are able to use it, and it's of course hypocritical for him to demand that you vacate when you've been in there under 5 minutes.... it's kind of laughable. It honestly seems like this person can't really be a roommate at all unless he has his own BR. But what you're looking for is reasonable.", "NTA \n\nThat has to suck having only one bathroom!!\n\nSet a morning schedule for showers. Talk it over and make an agreement on bathroom etiquette. He needs to learn to leave you alone when you're in the bathroom. He's being pushy and disrespectful. He can wait. \n\nIf your lease is coming up, think about renting a 2 bdrm 2 bath place together if you want to stay roommates. \n\nI don't think one bathroom works for you two.", "NTA - I'd do what I do when someone on the road rushes behind me and flashes his headlight (while I'm at the max speed allowed).

Start knocking hard on the door after he's been in the bathroom 5 minutes. Keep it up until he gets out.", "INFO:\n\nAre you using the bathroom during the period of time he gets ready for work?\n\nthe solution here is to set time blocks. he gets ready for work from (say - 7:00am - 7:30am) and you have morning bathroom time (7:30am - 8:00am) and other times are first come first serve. ( or flip the times)... that way you both have enough AM time in the bathroom to get ready and can set expectations clearly.", "NTA - Common courtesy is simply on these dullard types.  What you need to do tell him before using the bathroom again if he control himself from now on your going to stay in the bathroom using an extra minute for each damn knock he does.  So knock away dude.  Knock away.", "NTA\n\n30 minutes to an hour for a shower is ridiculous.  I hope he is paying more for the utilities than you are.\n\nWhat a waste of water.", "NTA and the only real solution is schedules but if he's a dick about it it's tough.", "NTA.

KNOCKING. BACK. People like this only learn when you fight fire with fire. Really be obnoxious about it too. If he doesn't like it? He can stop. Or you keep going forever.

NTA but goddamn.", "Yeah, I\u2019ll have a talk with him about it after work because that\u2019s really the only issue I have with him as he is a family member and I love him but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be late to work if I\u2019m in the bathroom pooping for 3 mins", "Just to make sure you are aware.

It's fair for him to expect a reasonable amount of time to get dressed but it's not fair for him to expect everything to revolve around him.\n\nEven if he won't agree to a specific time, just tell him you'll be in there at a specific time every morning for a set period of time. He will probably be fine with agreeing to that if you're flexible on the time. \n\nLike \"hey, to make sure we're working out our bathroom schedule - i'll be in there from 7:00am -7:30am so if you want to go in earlier or later, it will be open and available for you - but for that time period, expect me to be in there getting ready and i promise to be out by 7:30.\"\n\nhe won't need to knock because he knows when you're coming out.\n\nGive yourself a time period to get dressed and get him to agree with you on it.  Problem solved.
