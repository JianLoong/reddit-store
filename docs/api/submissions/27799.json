Moving into a 2 bathroom place is not an option 3. I think he\u2019s a great roommate in every other way and I know I\u2019m not a perfect roommate and probably a worse roommate than him in many other ways lol this isn\u2019t a major conflict just a small family/roommate squabble so I\u2019d appreciate everyone being kind he\u2019s not a bad person just enjoys his long showers i guess \n\nTy to all those who weighed in and gave their opinions and ideas for ways to solve the problem", "created_utc": 1695904106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16uep9i/aita_for_getting_annoyed_at_my_roommate_for/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then we'd have a conversation about spending a reasonable time in the bathroom.", "30-60 minutes for a shower is really excessive. I'd make a schedule when you can each use the bathroom and how long you should expect to be in there. 15 minutes would be my maximum. Strip, hop in, lather up, rinse off, towel dry, dress, brush teeth. Everything else should be able to be accomplished in your bedroom. You don't need to be hogging a major plumbing resource when you're not using the plumbing. It would be like eating a sandwich while hovering over the kitchen sink, while your roommate's arms are full of dirty dishes and your apartment doesn't have a dishwasher.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA tell him you will take however long you want when he does the same with his insanely long showers.

I\u2019ve done it in the past with roommates. He has from 7-7:30 you have from 7:30-8am. You have a structure break at 12pm so he knows to try and use the bathroom before or after. Whatever the times are - then everyone knows and agrees ahead of time.", "If the shower curtain is opaque, just use the toilet while he showers since he is a family member. I have usually permitted roomies this courtesy. As far as CONSISTENTLY knocking after 2-3 minutes while you're moving your bowels, that's nutty and rude. I'd probably holler, \"Occupied! Gimme 5 minutes!\"", "I also shared a bathroom with 2 other girls and we had no scheduling, I just introduced a nice little habit of communicating planned bathroom breaks. \n\n\n\nA.k.a. if I need it, I'll just go and use it. But if I'm planning to take a nice long bath or shower, I'll check in with them like \"Hey I'd like to take a bath in 5-10 minutes, is that ok with you? Will you need the bathroom?\" and they started doing the same. It was awesome because most of the time the other person was ok with it, sometimes they had a \"tactical wee\" before the shower or bath (after just peeing you don't really need to use the bathroom for a couple of hours at least), and sometimes they needed it too so we would reschedule, or found a compromise. Unless you're dealing with unreasonable AHs, it's such a small and quick solution: I can have a quick pee before my roomie lock herself in the bathroom for two hours, and she can chill in the tub knowing we won't come knocking. Win-win.", "Perhaps OP needs Dr. Sheldon Cooper to write up a roommate agreement.", "Right? What percentage of the water bill is this guy paying?

Usually if I know he\u2019s in there I just wait till he\u2019s done.", "From my perspective you knock if you don\u2019t know if the bathroom is occupied, if you know it is you just wait, no point in knocking if you already know someone\u2019s in there imo", "I tried to speak to him ab it this morning before making this post but I think it may have been a bad time so I\u2019ll try and talk about it again later and try to come up with a solution", "Well he\u2019s a family member so it\u2019s some family arrangements we agreed upon with my mom and grandfather", "As I\u2019ve previously stated I\u2019m a way worse roommate than him in other situations, it\u2019s not the biggest deal in the world, no need to be so harsh he\u2019s like a brother to me and again my family", "We don\u2019t pay water bills because we have a tank", "If he\u2019s late because you\u2019re in the bathroom for 3 minutes longer than usual, then he\u2019s late anyway.
