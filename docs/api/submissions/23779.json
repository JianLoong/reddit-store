I went through my dismay at the likelihood of ever owning a home, my worry being unable to afford repairs or a new car if my old clunker dies on me, and the stress I feel as a man who is unable to provide security and new experiences for my partner (she's my rock and doesn't expect these things of me, but it pains me regardless).\r  \n\r  \nHe just said \"the grass is always greener on the other side\" and told me I would have different, possibly worse stressors if I had more money.

I think your dad might have needed that reality check. Sure, everyone, regardless of their financial status, has problems and deals with anxiety. But man, there's a major difference between \"If any unexpected expense shows up, I'm going to have to choose between being able to eat and paying rent\" and \"What if I lose some of the money I invested\". Both stand to lose money if the worst were to happen, but the consequences would be ***very*** different. \n\nYour dad might genuinely have some anxiety regarding his investments, but at the end of the day, if he never gets a return on that money, it might sting, but it sounds like he'll be fine. I think he just needs to leave his own bubble and realise that far from everyone has disposable income to do whatever with.", "NTA? I think. You were venting to dad and he said some Boomer, insensitive shit. You didn\u2019t even ask for money, just told him he was being insensitive by comparing investments to your necessities. I don\u2019t know exactly how to improve the situation, as it just seems like two different tax brackets not being able to see it from each others pov, even if I think your dad is an ass for saying that. I don\u2019t get the YTA, people are allowed to vent to their parents.

I had an almost identical conversation with one of my parents about 5-6 years back (student loans figured prominently in it as well) and we ended up not talking for half a year. Their concern wasn't investments, but had I contacted enough of my political representatives to try and make my concerns as a constituent clear.\n\nI lost it at them and ended up hurling my phone across the room in rage (which of course only exacerbated my money problems).\n\nMy parent eventually took it to heart after a couple months of no contact and ended up researching what life was actually like for millennials. It's helped a lot, so hopefully this snapping at your dad makes him reflect as well.", "Every Y. T. A prolly never had to deal with being poor.\nLike even the logic behind this kind of talk is ridiculous. Who says it's good you don't make more money because it's hard to invest to someone who's problem is literally not having enough to cover basics. That's just crazy. I'd feel insulted as well. NTA", "NTA\n\nDoesn't sound like he's the type of person to talk to about these things so you might want to keep that in mind for future communication\n\nPeople who have money always say that money doesn't buy happiness. No but money pays the bills and buys food and helps you get health care and dental work so that you're not lying awake at night in the freezing cold in the middle of winter because you can't afford heat while starving to death because you haven't had any food for 3 days.\n\nYes rich people have problems too. I'm not saying their life is perfect. But they are often extraordinarily delusional when it comes to money", "NTA. That was a super asshole thing to say. Like, oh, thanks. I'm glad I don't have to worry about what Crypto to invest in, I'll just worry about if I can afford more than ramen this week. You're right, thanks for the perspective, dad.", "NTA. Your dad is a boomer and needed a reality check.", "NTA. Money can't buy happiness, but it increases the odds.", "Your dad has a major issue with empathy, as in, he seems to be incapable of it. Don't burn your bridge, but just know that conversation with him is never going to go anywhere you want it to. Next time he asks how you are, you can say: \"Fine.\" whether you are or you aren't. \n\nIn the meantime, is there an educational opportunity you can pursue that will enable you to get a better paying job? A business opportunity? Perhaps what you can ask Dad for is an introduction to a connection he has that would be someone who could hire you. It's not what you know, it's who you know. If dad is earning a lot and has good connections, that might be more useful than his pathetic attempt at sympathy.", "NTA - I just finished paying off a loan and mentioned it to my mum and she said I should put that money into savings. I responded well my mortgage is doubling so that money is allocated elsewhere. And she replied \u2018such is life\u2019 .. while she lives mortgage free. Sometimes people are very out of touch, it was very hard for me not to yell at her!", "NTA but maybe I can provide some perspective.\n\nFirst, you dad was an AH.  Just, no way around that.  You were venting your very legitimate concerns and at a minimum, your dad could have listened and sympathized.  He didn\u2019t.  He sucks.\n\nThat said, to put your dads \u201cinvestment\u201d comment into context, I\u2019m guessing that he is worried about retirement, inflation, how to have enough, the potential death of social security, etc. etc.  It\u2019s very hard to get to retirement age and wonder if you\u2019ve saved enough or if your going to be unable to afford food, shelter and medicine at age 80 when you can\u2019t do anything about it.  Does this stress excuse his comments?  No, it doesn\u2019t but it might make it make sense.", "YTA you are pissed because your dad is more successful than you are... but I bet you would be in a good mood if he offered money.  If you could act like more of a spoiled entitled brat, I would be surprised.", "YTA. I understand you are stressed and sometimes we vent to our nearest one. But after cooling off, we should apologize. Your father didn\u2019t mean any harm, he didn\u2019t cause your financial issue, and he tried to give a positive spin to reduce your stress. You know all of that and still didn\u2019t apologize to him.", "More money more problems.", "YTA. You admitted you were stressing about your financial situation so you blew up at your father over some silly comments. He may have been thoughtless but he\u2019s not an a-hole but you are for looking to make him a scapegoat for your anger & frustration about your own life.", "YTA, you have a place to live and food. Imagine a homeless person hearing you rant about being able to pay for a place to live and being able to afford food. Everyone has problems and just because they have money doesn't mean life is easy for them. It's not your Dad's fault you are financially stressed, why take your stress out on him?", "Yes-YTA. You have no right to victimize yourself. Unless you can point to your father failing you as a KID, you are responsible for your adult and educational choices-not him.\n\nThere are always people in the world that have more material things. It\u2019s how you live your life that matters most. Downplaying the loss of a spouse seems heartless to me, and your father isn\u2019t responsible for you & your GF financially, nor is he an AH for worrying about savings when he is likely much closer to retirement.", "YTA. By the sounds of it you grew up in a fairly well off household and didn't make choices that allowed you to keep that quality of life. I say that you are y t a because life is mostly about choices for someone in your situation. I grew up to poor parents. I earned more in my first job than my mum did at retirement. This is because I barely had holidays and no luxuries as a kid, as my parents made sure I went to a good first school that enabled me to get into a good (free) secondary one. There were lots of things I would have liked to do with my life, but when you grow up poor, you often see the value of money - I made choices that meant I would be financially secure, even if the subjects I studied and career path I chose were not the ones offering me the most enjoyment. My parents did not have the same opportunities as me because they grew up EVEN POORER. My mum was one of 5 and all the siblings shared one room in a developing country. Life is about choices when you grow up with enough money as you did. Don't blame your dad because you didn't make the best ones.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
