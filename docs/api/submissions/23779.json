No savings, no investments, no holidays; just survival basically. My father - who isn't 'rich' but earns about 3 times what I do - called to check in with how life was going, and I was honest with him.\r  \n\r  \nI explained that I'm upset with the cost of living and worried about how things will go in the future if I don't secure a better job soon (I've been trying for months). I went through my dismay at the likelihood of ever owning a home, my worry being unable to afford repairs or a new car if my old clunker dies on me, and the stress I feel as a man who is unable to provide security and new experiences for my partner (she's my rock and doesn't expect these things of me, but it pains me regardless).\r  \n\r  \nHe just said \"the grass is always greener on the other side\" and told me I would have different, possibly worse stressors if I had more money. I asked him what kind of stress he believes he has that I should be grateful I don't, and his response set me off: \"You're lucky you don't have to worry about which investments are going to be worthwhile.\"\r  \n\r  \nFrom there the conversation turned into an argument with me accusing him of being entirely out of touch with the reality of the world as most people experience it, and him empathising with a billionaire who lost a loved one saying \"wealthy people still have problems\". I told him he couldn't dare compare my struggle of choosing between adequate food or rent, to his uncertainty of whether his latest investment will pay off.\r  \n\r  \nThe call ended pretty quick after that and I was seething over it for hours, likening it to a rich man telling someone who can't afford to eat that they're lucky they don't have to decide between Ferraris. At the end of the day I know he doesn't mean to upset me and just doesn't have the same perspective as I do, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1691055338, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gzdhb/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_wealthier_father_about/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'll say it again. Money may not buy happiness, but at the very fucking least it mean I dont have to worry about the bare necessities trying to find happiness.\n\nWhether or not I can eat tonight is not the same level of concern of whether or not an investments gonna work out or not.", "NTA. I think your dad might have needed that reality check. Sure, everyone, regardless of their financial status, has problems and deals with anxiety. But man, there's a major difference between \"If any unexpected expense shows up, I'm going to have to choose between being able to eat and paying rent\" and \"What if I lose some of the money I invested\". Both stand to lose money if the worst were to happen, but the consequences would be ***very*** different. \n\nYour dad might genuinely have some anxiety regarding his investments, but at the end of the day, if he never gets a return on that money, it might sting, but it sounds like he'll be fine. I think he just needs to leave his own bubble and realise that far from everyone has disposable income to do whatever with.", "NTA? I think. You were venting to dad and he said some Boomer, insensitive shit. You didn\u2019t even ask for money, just told him he was being insensitive by comparing investments to your necessities. I don\u2019t know exactly how to improve the situation, as it just seems like two different tax brackets not being able to see it from each others pov, even if I think your dad is an ass for saying that. I don\u2019t get the YTA, people are allowed to vent to their parents. And yes there\u2019s plenty of people worse off than OP but damn he\u2019s just venting to his father.", "NTA - Your father is part of a very big ideological problem that dismisses the real struggle off working people.\n\nMoney doesn't buy happiness, yeah, but in the current economic system, happiness is still paywalled, there is no guarantee you may be happy if you get more money, but it is 100% guaranteed you'll be miserable if you don't.", "NTA and hopefully this can be a learning experience for your dad.  I had an almost identical conversation with one of my parents about 5-6 years back (student loans figured prominently in it as well) and we ended up not talking for half a year. Their concern wasn't investments, but had I contacted enough of my political representatives to try and make my concerns as a constituent clear.\n\nI lost it at them and ended up hurling my phone across the room in rage (which of course only exacerbated my money problems).\n\nMy parent eventually took it to heart after a couple months of no contact and ended up researching what life was actually like for millennials. It's helped a lot, so hopefully this snapping at your dad makes him reflect as well.", "Every Y. T. A prolly never had to deal with being poor.\nLike even the logic behind this kind of talk is ridiculous. Who says it's good you don't make more money because it's hard to invest to someone who's problem is literally not having enough to cover basics. That's just crazy. I'd feel insulted as well. NTA", "NTA\n\nDoesn't sound like he's the type of person to talk to about these things so you might want to keep that in mind for future communication\n\nPeople who have money always say that money doesn't buy happiness. No but money pays the bills and buys food and helps you get health care and dental work so that you're not lying awake at night in the freezing cold in the middle of winter because you can't afford heat while starving to death because you haven't had any food for 3 days.\n\nYes rich people have problems too. I'm not saying their life is perfect. But they are often extraordinarily delusional when it comes to money", "NTA. That was a super asshole thing to say. Like, oh, thanks. I'm glad I don't have to worry about what Crypto to invest in, I'll just worry about if I can afford more than ramen this week. You're right, thanks for the perspective, dad.", "NTA. Your dad is a boomer and needed a reality check.", "NTA. Money can't buy happiness, but it increases the odds.", "Your dad has a major issue with empathy, as in, he seems to be incapable of it. Don't burn your bridge, but just know that conversation with him is never going to go anywhere you want it to. Next time he asks how you are, you can say: \"Fine.\" whether you are or you aren't. \n\nIn the meantime, is there an educational opportunity you can pursue that will enable you to get a better paying job? A business opportunity? Perhaps what you can ask Dad for is an introduction to a connection he has that would be someone who could hire you. It's not what you know, it's who you know. If dad is earning a lot and has good connections, that might be more useful than his pathetic attempt at sympathy.", "NTA - I just finished paying off a loan and mentioned it to my mum and she said I should put that money into savings. I responded well my mortgage is doubling so that money is allocated elsewhere. And she replied \u2018such is life\u2019 .. while she lives mortgage free. Sometimes people are very out of touch, it was very hard for me not to yell at her!", "NTA but maybe I can provide some perspective.\n\nFirst, you dad was an AH.  Just, no way around that.  You were venting your very legitimate concerns and at a minimum, your dad could have listened and sympathized.  He didn\u2019t.  He sucks.\n\nThat said, to put your dads \u201cinvestment\u201d comment into context, I\u2019m guessing that he is worried about retirement, inflation, how to have enough, the potential death of social security, etc. etc.  It\u2019s very hard to get to retirement age and wonder if you\u2019ve saved enough or if your going to be unable to afford food, shelter and medicine at age 80 when you can\u2019t do anything about it.  Does this stress excuse his comments?  No, it doesn\u2019t but it might make it make sense.", "YTA you are pissed because your dad is more successful than you are... but I bet you would be in a good mood if he offered money.  If you could act like more of a spoiled entitled brat, I would be surprised.", "YTA. I understand you are stressed and sometimes we vent to our nearest one. But after cooling off, we should apologize. Your father didn\u2019t mean any harm, he didn\u2019t cause your financial issue, and he tried to give a positive spin to reduce your stress. You know all of that and still didn\u2019t apologize to him.", "More money more problems.", "YTA. You admitted you were stressing about your financial situation so you blew up at your father over some silly comments. He may have been thoughtless but he\u2019s not an a-hole but you are for looking to make him a scapegoat for your anger & frustration about your own life.", "YTA, you have a place to live and food. Imagine a homeless person hearing you rant about being able to pay for a place to live and being able to afford food. Everyone has problems and just because they have money doesn't mean life is easy for them. It's not your Dad's fault you are financially stressed, why take your stress out on him?", "Yes-YTA. You have no right to victimize yourself. Unless you can point to your father failing you as a KID, you are responsible for your adult and educational choices-not him.\n\nThere are always people in the world that have more material things. It\u2019s how you live your life that matters most. Downplaying the loss of a spouse seems heartless to me, and your father isn\u2019t responsible for you & your GF financially, nor is he an AH for worrying about savings when he is likely much closer to retirement.", "YTA. By the sounds of it you grew up in a fairly well off household and didn't make choices that allowed you to keep that quality of life. I say that you are y t a because life is mostly about choices for someone in your situation. I grew up to poor parents. I earned more in my first job than my mum did at retirement. This is because I barely had holidays and no luxuries as a kid, as my parents made sure I went to a good first school that enabled me to get into a good (free) secondary one. There were lots of things I would have liked to do with my life, but when you grow up poor, you often see the value of money - I made choices that meant I would be financially secure, even if the subjects I studied and career path I chose were not the ones offering me the most enjoyment. My parents did not have the same opportunities as me because they grew up EVEN POORER. My mum was one of 5 and all the siblings shared one room in a developing country. Life is about choices when you grow up with enough money as you did. Don't blame your dad because you didn't make the best ones.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's something particularly enraging about dealing with family members who could work on their emotional intelligence. My partner's family members own property and complained to us about how hard that was. We are currently living in a housing crisis, may never own a home and are working very precarious jobs. We didn't say anything to them but it was very difficult to stomach. Wealthy people do have problems, they're just not as pressing as \"will I have a roof over my head in the coming months?\" or \"how many meals can I subsist on?\". Your father doesn't owe you anything but it is sad that he can hear how his child is really struggling and not want to offer any sort of support or care.", "NTA, insert .gif with the guy wiping his tears with dollar bills", "Money can't buy you happiness, but poverty can't buy you anything.", "Having money\u2019s not everything. Not having it is.\n\nLine hits so much harder as an adult", "it's a sin to be rich, it's a low down shame to be poor", "I feel like regardless if it's family this kind of talk doesn't reduce stress at all. Who wants to hear when really struggling with money \"it's good you don't have more\" basically said that. NTA.", "To answer your question: it's his dad. In healthy families, you can vent to each other for emotional support. It's kind of sad you have to ask this question. \n\nAnd your 'homeless person' example isn't great here: the OP is the relatively poorer person complaining. Just as it would be insensitive for OP to complain about money to a homeless person, it's insensitive for dad to complain about money to his relatively poorer son.", "You will always find someone who has worse problems than you. Yes, from the perspective of a homeless person, the OP would probably sound like a brat. But if you constantly compare your problems with others, you would basically not be allowed to feel bad about anything in your life, because someone always has it worse. \n\nI think the OP might have been looking for some empathy when he told his dad about his stress/anxiety regarding his financial situation. Maybe a bit of a pep talk or something? I don't think someone who feels like they're one dead engine away from not being able to eat or have somewhere to live, really wants to hear how his dad is seemingly indifferent to his financial problems and instead starts talking about the anxiety he feels regarding his investments. It's kind of a slap in the face to express how you are worried about not being able to eat, and then have someone say \"We all got problems\" (or even, \"Some people are homeless\").", "I disagree with your take. \n\nHe is in deep stress and looking for comfort or at the very least comfort and validation. His dad should have been there to comfort him or at least provide support or some sort of guidance. \n\nHis dad is very insensitive and while op blowing up on him is somewhat bad, i think in these extreme circumstances, he is still NTA.  Op is probably one paycheck away from being homeless. \n\nHis dad did not have to offer money, just understanding and kindness, like a parent should.", "wtf are u talking about", "Guess you've never heard of inflation, huh.", "sounds like you've never had to worry about food or rent.", "Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy security.", "Op's dad is always going to be around forever to bottle up the stress for them? No. Op's dad can never feel financially stressed too? No.", "Op can use words and say I could use some help getting rid of stress or empathy because they have been worrying about the future. It sounds like op went on a rant about being financially stressed out and ops dad responded in turn. Op's dad can't complain as well because there would always be someone worse off than him?", "As an adult you are responsible for your own feelings, it's not other people's jobs to coddle you and make you feel better. Op is no longer a child and should figure out how to reduce the amount of stress. Op is not the only one hurting financially in the entire world, many people are and don't get in arguments with their parents.", "It's not coddling if you offer some kind words of support and any decent parent or person can do that, especially after they gone and pour their heart out about their stress. I do believe an apology is needed for lashing out but it could of all been avoided if the parent didn't try and one up him! \n\nNot everyone lashes out in response to stress but it is one of the ways someone can react and parent's should at least be supportive or kind during those periods.", "What if Op's dad was trying to empathize in his own way by talking about his financial stress? We probably won't know because op got angry and decided to get in an argument instead of look for words of support or have a conversation.", "If the dad talked about his past, if he ever struggled, then sympathised with him then it would have been wrong of op to get angry however the dad did not and instead tried to get sympathy from op for his struggles, which if op is correct in what he said, is in no way reassuring to op and if anything almost insulting as he offered no help or support to op in any way.\n\nWhile I do get there could be another side op is possibly not telling us, it would be impossible to determine this alone from op's post.", "Op posted here about blowing up at his wealthier father after op called his father. He didn't need to get angry and argue on the phone. Op could have said that the conversation needed to end much earlier and hung up. It's Op's right to yell at or argue with anyone who make him angry? I'm saying YTA because there was absolutely no point in staying on the phone seething, it benefits absolutely no one. A conversation can be had later, when one or both parties calm down."]}
