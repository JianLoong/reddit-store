The fact that you only see him hit on girls doesn't mean he isn't bisexual.\n\nBesides that, you sound like you have some major jealousy issues as well. \n\nJust because he's your Gf's ex doesn't mean you need to be rude to him.", "So;\n\n* Deny his bisexual-ness for no reason other than your own ingrained prejudices\n* write a post which routinely brings up said sexuality\n* 'Joke' about beating him up, and finally\n* act strangely enough for even your GF to make note of it.\n\nYes, YTA. And you do sound creepy.", ">(18M) who is also her ex, claims to be bisexual (I believe this is only so he can date women) \n\nYour logic here is laughable. Why say you are bisexual to date with girls? Straight guys also date girls.", "YTA\n\nGeez, prejudiced much? Its awfully ignorant to assume he\u2019s not bi because you don\u2019t see him flirt with guys. A better question would be *why would that be any of your business?*. \n\nAnd don\u2019t joke about inflicting violence on people. Believe it or not people have actually been charged just on that basis alone.", "YTA - You don\u2019t have to like him but you can show basic manners by acknowledging him in social situations. No one has asked you to be his best friend. I feel that you are a bit jealous of his friendship with your girlfriend. If you can\u2019t stand him then break up with your girlfriend because she is just as likely to choose him over you.", "YTA. I believe both of them. You are the only saying you just ignore him although that, in itself, is childish in the extreme. Plus. You don\u2019t trust your gf. You wouldn\u2019t be threatened by him if you did.", "ESH - I get your guys are young, but this sounds like middleschool drama", "YTA for being both creepy and biphobic\n\nOk, so you never personally witnessed him hitting on a guy, so what? Aside from the fact that you don't hover over him every second of his life, has it ever occured to you that because of heterosexuality being widely viewed as default, it might be WAY easier as a guy to openly pursue girls than guys? Especially since straight guys tend to act very hostile when you come at them assuming they aren't straight.\n\nPeople calling you prejudiced because you are prejudiced. Only accepting people's sexuality if they fit into your image of their sexuality is literally the definition of prejudice.", "This sounds petty and worthless of all our times. Just tell the guy you don\u2019t want to hang together and move on", "I don't really agree with questioning bisexuality on that basis, but I don't care. NTA just for the simple reason that I would not want to hang out every day with my gf and her ex.", "You think he's faking his sexuality to... Flirt with girls? And you're going as far to 'joking' that you'll beat up the guy simply because you don't like him? Oh, and your girlfriend seems to be noticing your odd behavior. Pretty sure there's a lot of missing information regarding your personality. I'd love to hear the friend's side of the story.\n\nYTA.\n\nETA: Okay, so apperantly your girlfriend is the one who makes the joke. Neat, so not only she knows that you dislike the friend, but that you're also actively hostile towards him. You know ignoring him won't solve the issue, right? Not only is it disrespectful, but that's also another way to show passive-aggresive hostility. Make eye contact, be polite yet assertive; if you think he's crossing a line, then calmly correct him. But you need to let go of the prejudice in order to make this work.", "YTA, you honestly sound jealous. Why do you care if that person claims to be bisexual? You have no right to comment on it at all.", "I\u2019m going to go nta leave ur girlfriend", "Hmm I don\u2019t think it was clear that my girlfriend is the one that does these jokes because I did say she jokes with me about it, and she is just recently saying something when she had been fine with it. I would imagine he still comes around maybe not to bother me but for some other reason\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
