We have 3 kids (7, 4, & 2) and we've found ourselves in a place where we are now primarily acting as parents and rarely working on our relationship as husband and wife.  We started seeing a counselor who suggested we take a \"love language\" test and work with each other on finding ways to speak each others language.  \n\nOf course, my husband's primary love language is physical touch (honestly, are there any men out there that aren't like this?).  My primary language is acts of service.  As we were talking about ways that we can speak each others language and do things that make them feel loved and seen, my husband said that him coming home and doing dishes during his lunch break should count as an act of service.  If I gave him any more of a side-eye, I would have tipped over.  I told him that doing dishes and other basic chores like that don't count as an act of service because that sort of thing should be the baseline contribution as an adult member of the household.  \n\nHis argument is that he goes out of his way to do the dishes over his lunch break when he could be spending that time doing other things.  His office is about an 8-10 minute drive from our house so he comes home for lunch pretty much every day.  He'll let the dog outside, make himself leftovers or a sandwich, do whatever dishes are in the sink, maybe start or switch a load of laundry, then go back to work.  \n\nHe is also the one who picks up kids from daycare after work, so I get home before he does every day and get dinner started.  He says that by doing the dishes over lunch, he's doing an act of service for me so that I don't have to do them after work and can just get dinner started.  In his mind, he's going out of his way to do something to make my life easier.  \n\nWhen I told him that doing dishes shouldn't count, he said \"Ok, then I'm sure you won't mind if I start bringing lunch to the office or getting lunch with coworkers instead.\"   So that's what he's been doing since, staying at work for lunch or going out with coworkers.  \n\nThat means I'm stuck doing a sink full of dishes before I can start dinner after work.  I'll admit, it sucks and it delays dinner which makes the kids cranky.  My husband hasn't complained once though, so at least he's holding his tongue.  \n\nI finally told him that I do appreciate him coming home and doing a few things over his lunch break, but I still don't think that should count as an act of service.  But he's insisting it does since it obviously makes my life easier and he's doing something that I otherwise would have to do every day.  \n\nHe said he will only start coming home for lunch again if I admit that him doing dishes at that time counts as an act of service, which I think is kind of an AH move on his part, especially since I don't want him to start thinking that basic chores count.

By taking the time and effort to contribute during his limited break, he demonstrates his commitment to supporting you and making your life easier. It's important to appreciate his willingness to prioritize your well-being and acknowledge the extra effort he puts in.

Otherwise he could count picking up the kids as well, since, you know, otherwise you'd have to do it. \n\nAnyways tho I think that you guys should take this issue into another session of couple's counselling and you need to establish that in the end it only matters whether the recipient feels like it fills their need. If something doesn't fill your cup, it just doesn't. If your husband wants to connect more, he needs to listen and get over himself and his expectations.

We have 3 kids (7, 4, & 2) and we've found ourselves in a place where we are now primarily acting as parents and rarely working on our relationship as husband and wife.  We started seeing a counselor who suggested we take a \"love language\" test and work with each other on finding ways to speak each others language.  \n\nOf course, my husband's primary love language is physical touch (honestly, are there any men out there that aren't like this?).  My primary language is acts of service.  As we were talking about ways that we can speak each others language and do things that make them feel loved and seen, my husband said that him coming home and doing dishes during his lunch break should count as an act of service.  If I gave him any more of a side-eye, I would have tipped over.  I told him that doing dishes and other basic chores like that don't count as an act of service because that sort of thing should be the baseline contribution as an adult member of the household.  \n\nHis argument is that he goes out of his way to do the dishes over his lunch break when he could be spending that time doing other things.  His office is about an 8-10 minute drive from our house so he comes home for lunch pretty much every day.  He'll let the dog outside, make himself leftovers or a sandwich, do whatever dishes are in the sink, maybe start or switch a load of laundry, then go back to work.  \n\nHe is also the one who picks up kids from daycare after work, so I get home before he does every day and get dinner started.
