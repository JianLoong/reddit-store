I moved pretty far and the only way to get home is on a flight. My mom is a single mom who works as a nurse, so I know she can't always afford flights. I got a job to try to balance that cost for her so she wasn't carrying the weight of it all.\n\nThis situation started months ago. Whenever I lived at home I carried most of the weight with cleaning. I go to a rigorous college and most of the time whenever I come home I'm super exhausted. My mother has a habit of falling off on cleaning whenever I'm not around and that got worse with college. I would often come home and there would be nothing cleaned, no groceries, and she didn't seem to care. For example, whenever I came home for Christmas she complained about how much money she would end up having to spend on groceries and told us we would just have to figure something else out. I didn't have a job at the time so it was me and my sister trying to figure out getting food. On top of that, I'd helped her buy a house before we left for college and when I got home nothing was unpacked and I basically spent the whole break unpacking my room. I know my mom works hard, but I expected at the minimum that she would try to set up my room and make it more comfortable for us. She also makes lots of rude comments whenever I come home. I went home this past weekend and she made comments about my weight, my finances, and asked questions about my fake ID.\n\nOn the ride to the airport, I told her that I didn't really think that I would be coming home often. I didn't enjoy feeling like I was on the defense the entire time and I didn't like being a maid. I already do so so much work at school I just want to relax and be able to kick up my feet whenever I come home and I feel like she doesn't understand that. She did not take this lightly and began yelling at me. She called me ungrateful and told me that so many other kids would beg to have moms like mine. I tried to rebut her saying that just because other kids would want to live in these conditions doesn't mean that they're good. She didn't take that well and just shut down for the rest of the car ride. I explained that this wasn't something that came out of left field. I've been telling her for a while that I didn't like how she spoke to me and that I didn't like the conditions whenever I came home and I'd love to find a middle ground to try to fix it. She didn't make any effort to try to help me on that so I'm just deciding not to be around as much anymore.\n\nMy sister called me that night and told me that I made the right decision, but other family members have reached out to me and called me an asshole saying that I need to be more respectful of my mother and all the work that she does. I'm kind of torn on this because I know I did what was best for me but I also didn't really want to hurt my mother's feelings. so aita?\n\nEDIT: there seems to be some confusion about who pays for school. i am on a full ride through questbridge, and i pay for all of my personal expenses. she does not contribute financially", "created_utc": 1686919693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14avzpq/aita_for_telling_my_mother_i_wont_be_coming_home/", "score": 556, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, it's not stated directly in the post, but I don't think we'd be reading this if you were just expected to do basic daily chores vs. a full overhaul of cleaning every visit. \n\nPeople saying that she has a right to live as she pleases because she doesn't mind a messy house, or you need to suck it up and pull your weight at home likely don't understand what a truly dirty home looks like.

Yes, your mom can choose to live like that, but you can also choose not to be around it.\n\nThose saying \"just cut back on visiting and don't give an explanation\" or chastising you for sharing something about it are being misguided too. If your mom is so filthy it makes you uncomfortable, then she should be informed so she can decide if she wants to take steps to maintain a relationship with her adult children who no longer have to be present or if she wants to value her mess over you. Eventually she'll ask why you don't visit and you'll have to tell her. Better to let her know sooner rather than later. \n\nI think it's great you still want to spend time with your mom, and I'm sorry it's not going great right now. \n\nAs for the fake ID.

No, but still NTA.", "I'm going to guess that the family members that are calling and upset come from your mother's generation or later? And that generation would be Boomer?\n\nNTA", "YTA a little bit. For one thing, if you have another place to stay just stay there. You don\u2019t have to announce it. That\u2019s just you starting a fight.\n\nAlso, at 19 you are not a child and are not entitled to household services from anyone. If you don\u2019t like a place, don\u2019t go there. Do for yourself.", "While we all had our chores to do, mom NEVER let the kitchen go empty or slacked off on housework once we were all grown and on our own.", "She doesn't seem to make any effort when you come home then gets angry when you say you won't come home as often.", "NAH - It sounds like your mom is genuinely struggling. It sucks that you don't have financially successful, doting parents to come home to on college break, but that's just reality for a lot of people.   \nIf I were you, I wouldn't burn this bridge, but maintain some boundaries. You don't need to visit your mom every break, but  maybe visit for at least once a year. If you have a friend or other relative in town you can stay with, that might be better. It can be tough figuring out boundaries during the college years. Good luck!", "I recommend reading \u201cadult children of emotionally immature parents\u201d.", "NTA the fact that your sister, the one who knows the most on both sides, is on your side is all you need to know.", "NTA.  Going to visit your mother appears to be something you do FOR HER.  It is a chore for you as you have to clean, etc.  I would find another place to visit and block the people who think it's ok for your mom to treat you like unpaid help.", "NAH. Isn't she depressed?", "I think you told her this to get under her skin. Your 19 and going to college\u2026..relax.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation or responsibility to your mother whatsoever. You had every right to bring up your concerns but her response was manipulative & refusing to take responsibility for her behavior.", "I would argue that everyone deserves respect until they prove that they don't. But that's just me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Especially not having money for food when the college aged kids come home! To expect you guys to scrounge up money with no job so you can eat is BS. She could have done some extra shifts before you came or gone to the food bank if she truly couldn\u2019t afford it.", "Agreed. I was experiencing the insulting already, then one of the things that made me feel completely unwelcome at my parents' house during university holidays was I always had to buy my own food and cook my own meals. It was like being back at university only even more expensive and time-consuming, because I had no existing supplies at my parents' place. I went back very very rarely.", "Right? I'd never beg to have that mother", "She\u2019s a disgusting person and imagine how she treats her patients. I worked as a pediatric nurse for years and so many parents would be thrilled their child is alive and healthy. Lost my youngest brother when he was 27 and my parents would give anything to have one more day with him.", "Also if she\u2019s so broke that she can\u2019t afford to have food for their visit, wasting money on plane tickets is irresponsible. They will just have to catch up over Skype", "i found the house, set up the meetings with the realtors, packed the entire house, and when she couldn\u2019t understand some of the finance things i went to those meetings too. i didn\u2019t pay for anything obvi, but i helped do most of the heavy lifting", "I'm mostly on OP's side but I don't get the unpacking thing.  Why would they expect their mom to unpack their room?  It's their room?  I wouldn't even want my mom to unpack my room.", "I feel crazy that people are acting like mom magically got lazy. I think it\u2019s obvious she is struggling with this massive change in her life. OP is very young, they\u2019re right not to let mom treat them this way and they should stand up for themselves - but I think they are missing the bigger picture. Your mom cares for you immensely and having you out of the house has her wrestling with big feelings that she doesn\u2019t know how to handle. It\u2019s not your job to fix her, but just keep this in the back of your mind when she is being annoying.", "\ud83d\ude93", "My only real contribution here is, if you're on a full scholarship *do not* risk fucking it up by using a fake ID.", "Expecting groceries in the kitchen and a generally clean house doesn\u2019t seem like shes asking \u201cto be waited on\u201d. \n\nIt seems like OP has done a lot of the adult responsibilities around the house for a long while and her mom is struggling to adjust to having to do it all herself again. But OP should have never had those expectations on her in the first place and it\u2019s time for her to start laying some boundaries down so she doesn\u2019t have to carry those expectations for the rest of her life.", "i\u2019m on full scholarship! besides that i pay for all my daily expenses and my bills", "Not really concerned, no. Super common thing for under age college students.", "\ud83d\ude93", "Isn\u2019t this the norm in college to be able to get drunk? 21 drinking age is ridiculous.", "Grow up.", "FWIW, if it wasn't that she \"brought you into this world\", there would be some other reason why you *owe* her unconditional and unlimited gratitude, submission, compliance, and dedication.\n\nSource: adult adoptee", "Your mother has no right to be verbally abusive to you as well as being neglectful (no food, dirty house, etc). As a fellow nurse, I\u2018m ashamed and appalled at her behavior and the ones enabling it. Worked as a pediatric nurse for years and she should be grateful her children are alive and healthy.  Lost my brother when he was 27 and my parents would give anything to have one more day with him. Your mom may never change but you are in control of your life. I would take a break from visiting and if she or other family gives you grief, tell them finances are tight and go as LC as you can. Good luck sweetie!", "This attitude is actually the best.", "Likely she's spending all her money on take out", "Was the car ride on the way to the airport the best time to have this conversation.", "Serious question: does your mom have mental impairments of any sort? I'm not asking to be a dick, it just seems odd that a fully functional adult would need their child to help them arrange to buy a house. Maybe that has something to do with executive functioning in general?", "I\u2019m having trouble reconciling that with your post.\n\nYour post says you went home, didn\u2019t have a job, and the pantry was bare.\n\nYet, you somehow also paid all your own bills. So phone, and health insurance, and travel, and all your own food and daily expenses\u2026.\n\nMom isn\u2019t helping you?", "Ugh unless you were raised mormon, in LDS folklore/mythology it's taught that children PICK their parents", "i can clarify the timeline! i got a job when i went back in january and have been paying for my own stuff since. before having a job i lived off of my refunds my school would give me and scholarship money. my sister works, so for that first trip she provided for us both", "It also sounds like the mother was never a house goddess. That won't change just because the girl goes to college. Part of growing up is accepting your parents as the people they are. The sense of entitlement here bothers me. Life doesn't offer many opportunities to put your feet up-ever.", "That's all on you. NTA for the majority of the other issues."]}
