I moved pretty far and the only way to get home is on a flight. My mom is a single mom who works as a nurse, so I know she can't always afford flights. I got a job to try to balance that cost for her so she wasn't carrying the weight of it all.\n\nThis situation started months ago. Whenever I lived at home I carried most of the weight with cleaning. I go to a rigorous college and most of the time whenever I come home I'm super exhausted. My mother has a habit of falling off on cleaning whenever I'm not around and that got worse with college. I would often come home and there would be nothing cleaned, no groceries, and she didn't seem to care. For example, whenever I came home for Christmas she complained about how much money she would end up having to spend on groceries and told us we would just have to figure something else out. I didn't have a job at the time so it was me and my sister trying to figure out getting food. On top of that, I'd helped her buy a house before we left for college and when I got home nothing was unpacked and I basically spent the whole break unpacking my room. I know my mom works hard, but I expected at the minimum that she would try to set up my room and make it more comfortable for us. She also makes lots of rude comments whenever I come home. I went home this past weekend and she made comments about my weight, my finances, and asked questions about my fake ID.\n\nOn the ride to the airport, I told her that I didn't really think that I would be coming home often. I didn't enjoy feeling like I was on the defense the entire time and I didn't like being a maid. I already do so so much work at school I just want to relax and be able to kick up my feet whenever I come home and I feel like she doesn't understand that. She did not take this lightly and began yelling at me. She called me ungrateful and told me that so many other kids would beg to have moms like mine. I tried to rebut her saying that just because other kids would want to live in these conditions doesn't mean that they're good. She didn't take that well and just shut down for the rest of the car ride. I explained that this wasn't something that came out of left field. I've been telling her for a while that I didn't like how she spoke to me and that I didn't like the conditions whenever I came home and I'd love to find a middle ground to try to fix it. She didn't make any effort to try to help me on that so I'm just deciding not to be around as much anymore.\n\nMy sister called me that night and told me that I made the right decision, but other family members have reached out to me and called me an asshole saying that I need to be more respectful of my mother and all the work that she does. I'm kind of torn on this because I know I did what was best for me but I also didn't really want to hurt my mother's feelings. so aita?\n\nEDIT: there seems to be some confusion about who pays for school. i am on a full ride through questbridge, and i pay for all of my personal expenses. she does not contribute financially", "created_utc": 1686919693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14avzpq/aita_for_telling_my_mother_i_wont_be_coming_home/", "score": 1554, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No, it's not stated directly in the post, but I don't think we'd be reading this if you were just expected to do basic daily chores vs. a full overhaul of cleaning every visit. \n\nPeople saying that she has a right to live as she pleases because she doesn't mind a messy house, or you need to suck it up and pull your weight at home likely don't understand what a truly dirty home looks like.

Yes, your mom can choose to live like that, but you can also choose not to be around it.\n\nThose saying \"just cut back on visiting and don't give an explanation\" or chastising you for sharing something about it are being misguided too. If your mom is so filthy it makes you uncomfortable, then she should be informed so she can decide if she wants to take steps to maintain a relationship with her adult children who no longer have to be present or if she wants to value her mess over you. Eventually she'll ask why you don't visit and you'll have to tell her. Better to let her know sooner rather than later. \n\nI think it's great you still want to spend time with your mom, and I'm sorry it's not going great right now. \n\nAs for the fake ID.

I go to a rigorous college and most of the time whenever I come home I'm super exhausted. My mother has a habit of falling off on cleaning whenever I'm not around and that got worse with college. I would often come home and there would be nothing cleaned, no groceries, and she didn't seem to care.\n\nis she asking you to help with cleaning, or is she comfortable with the level of cleanliness in her home, but you are not, and take it upon yourself to clean?\n\n> For example, whenever I came home for Christmas she complained about how much money she would end up having to spend on groceries and told us we would just have to figure something else out.\n\ndoes she genuinely have trouble affording that much food? some other commenters are saying things about not having bought groceries for \"Christmas dinner\", but it sounds like you are talking about expecting her to buy all your food for a 2-4 week christmas break from school, which can be alot of money. IMO i think parents should still be feeding their 19 year old in this case for sure, but if she genuinely doesnt have the money, she doesnt have the money.\n\n>On top of that, I'd helped her buy a house before we left for college and when I got home nothing was unpacked and I basically spent the whole break unpacking my room. I know my mom works hard, but I expected at the minimum that she would try to set up my room and make it more comfortable for us. \n\nthis is mega entitled. you are a grown ass woman, unpack your own shit. totally unreasonable expectation.", "I do not think you are an AH.  Do you think your mom might be depressed?  kt", "I\u2019m still stuck on the fake ID thing.", "Ditto, but I am concerned that you helped her buy a house. OP, Do you mean that you co-signed?", "For some reason, I don't believe much of what she says. Sounds like a spoiled brat who thinks her Mom should wait on her hand and foot.", "Nah, not all mean girls become nurses. Some of them become teachers!!\n\nIn all seriousness, though, a lot of people who are like that go into professions where they have power over other people. Nursing and teaching are roles where you have a lot of power.", "I highly recommend the videos by Dr Ramani on YouTube. She actually had a video on this exact topic.", "I love that you went with Skype before Zoom or Facetime. Do people still Skype??", "Yeah. You should be unpacking your own stuff unless you want her going through your things and deciding what\u2019s important. Also, an adult who\u2019s home for Christmas for a month or 2 can go to the store and do some of the chores while mom is at work. Obviously OP shouldn\u2019t be doing everything and mom needs to communicate if she needs for adult kids to pitch in for groceries beforehand so that they can make the decision to come home or not. And although common, mom should leave off on comments about your weight, etc. except for the fake ID thing. As a nurse, she\u2019s probably seen her fair share of underage alcohol deaths, so I get why she\u2019d have a concern and maybe make a comment about it.", "I've always wondered how that would work - is it some kind of vacuum vagina thing? Vaccuterus?", "They already answered that before you even commented https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14avzpq/comment/jod9z2p/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "Drinking age in most of the US is 21.", "its to buy booze", "I changed my mind, if that\u2019s how she plans to end my life I might actually wanna live.", "Maybe she's got depression. That would explain the behaviour including the messy house", "Found the mom", "My youngest is here because of an extra glass of wine at lunch, and rashly thought, \"Well what could happen at my age?\" (Surprise!)\n\nAnd I have a friend who blames her youngest on dark chocolate Tim Tams. She claims it was the only way she could get her husband to share.", "Oh my god I tried Tim Tams for the first time a few weeks ago when an international team flew in from Aus to help us set up a new project and I am now so upset I can\u2019t get them here.", "This may be the most Australian thing I've ever heard.", "None of this makes you TA, but I found myself feeling a little sorry for your mom. Been through a rough divorce, presumably works long hours in a job that is extremely physically and emotionally taxing (and horribly undercompensated) and now probably finds herself eating in the hospital cafeteria and then coming home to an empty nest every night because her (final?) child moved away.\n\nAgain, you are still NTA there, but I hope your mother can pull it all back together again for her sake and the sake of you all.", "Nta, I wonder though whether she needs to be screened for depression.", "NTA.  Your mother is a gaslighter and has gaslighted you for years to treat you like the maid, chef and personal assistant.  I would go LC and not come home very often.", "All \"mean girls\" grow up to be women.... and a lot of women become nurses. By no means are most or even a significant proportion of nurses \"mean girls\" \u2014 the profession is filled to the brim with empathetic people who do a tremendously mentally and physically stressful job, for not enough pay, at great cost to their well-being. A huge proportion wash out in the first few years because of what it takes.\n\nSorry you had less than stellar interactions with your caregivers. They should have done a better job at sublimating their own emotions.", "We all literally fought millions of sperm to be the one to fertilize the egg, so I don\u2019t buy that argument", "I wouldn't call that unpacking", "Yeah there are a few things in here that make me think we're not getting the whole story.", "sorry, it's like the ghostbusters trap once it's activated", "I\u2019m here because my parents wanted a girl. I\u2019m a gay guy, so they got half their wish.", "I feel your pain. Earlier this year, I was diagnosed with coeliac disease, which means (dramatic sobbing) no Tim Tams ever again. \n\nThere is a similar-ish GF product, but it's not the same. \n\n(If you are in the US, [Aussie Food Direct](https://aussiefoodexpress.com/collections/tim-tam-biscuits) sells the genuine Arnott's Tim Tams.)", "And no, my friend didn't name her kid \"Tim Tam\"."]}
