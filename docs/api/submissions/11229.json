She's a grown woman and should at least attempt to care for herself and her underaged daughters.", "Nice", "Well, one underage daughter now. 18 year old will need to get a job but I'm sure you think Mom is on the hook for continuing to provide for still, heck probably even pay for college. Well I'm sure she would have but shit happens. They weren't planning on Dad dying at 47. My point is that the married daughter with child lived there for practically free so they could save money and now at the thought of staying and helping Mom out by paying rent, it is completely out of the question. Does she have to stay? No, but don't act like Mom wasn't helping out. I wonder if they even contributed proportionally for food? What about baby sitting? Gas, electric, water for 2 is 100 a month, so they've been paying 100 a person not counting baby in rent for at least 3 years.", "Of course they didn't plan on the father dying, but they should have had money saved away in the case anything like that happened. It's not up to OP to help pay for everything. Regardless of them living there, if it wasn't stated from the get-go for them to help out more financially, it shouldn't be expected later on. We don't know if they helped out with anything else, but I'm assuming they have due to the way the mom reacted to them leaving. I genuinely doubt the mom was helping with much cause she didn't work and was just a stay at home mom according to OP. It was most likely just \"left over money\" the husband had before he passed. I dunno though. I still don't think that they should pay for anything if it wasn't stated from the beginning. \n\nPersonally, I pay $250 a month for just rent at my moms place. We have 6 people living here right now. That's not including paying for groceries, toilet paper, laundry stuff, gas, electricity etc. That makes it go up to $700 a month sometimes. I trade off paying for this stuff amongst us because it was stated to me once I turned 18 that I'd have to start paying. If that same or a similar conversation happened between OP and the mom, I'd understand your side."]}
