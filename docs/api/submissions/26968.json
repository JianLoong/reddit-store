If I tell my husband something bothers me, he stops doing it, and I do the same for him. If you truly love someone, you respect them. Little things can add up, and become big issues.

Then he has the fucking *gall* to complain that you dont want him ruining your clothing?\n\nIm not going to say its time to break up with him but it is time to have a very fuckin serious conversation with him. He owes his entire current life style to your kind heart and generosity, and so far it doesnt seem like hes showing how grateful he is.", "NTA. Um, wtf? I played paintball for years. Good paintballs stain clothes permanently. We all knew that. You wear junk clothes or you buy paintball specific gear.\n\n Over the years, paintballs have become more bright and permanent to prevent, or at least stifle cheating. When I played tournaments, I used paint that stains even your skin. You ain't wiping that shit off. \n\nMore importantly, paintball is expensive as FUCK. That's why most of us stop playing. We need money for grownup things. No unemployed person has any business on a paintball field. I've had lots of different hobbies and paintball was easily the most expensive.", "NTA - but please ask yourself why you are with someone without a job, without the ability to take care of themselves.

Why not go a step further and head out to a thrift shop, yard sale, etc., and buy him a handful of used t-shirts? You're already paying for all this.

He pays for his own paintball games. \n\nYou do realize he's treating you like his mommy.", "NTA at all  \n\n\nFirst off, communication is key with all of this. You both should be able to voice your sides without any dispute; your side and his side, no finger-pointing, respectively.  \nIf he doesn't have a job, and is fully capable of getting one, I personally think charging him for any damaged clothes seems like a good and effective idea. If he's inconsiderate to that extent, it's only rational to hammer down on his irresponsibility by having him feel some sting.  \nThen again, I have only been put in a *very* loosely similar situation of possessions *once*, so I'm by no means an expert.  \n\n\nRegardless, I wish you both luck and hope a happy medium is found", "NTA..  it's not wrong to want to preserve your clothing.

Thats basic respect and common courtesy.", "NTA thats a child not a partner lol", "NTA\n\nPaintball *should* wash out, but often won't.\n\nAnd that doesn't include the fact that clothes worn for paintball will take a battering from all of the running around so he will most likely end up getting them sweaty, dirty and manky from running around, if he doesn't rip them or damage them first.\n\nSo wanting to preserve your own clothes seems pretty sensible.\n\nIf he wants to go paintballing, he can use some older sets of his own clothes, buy some cheap clothes to wear, or if he wants to be fancy, buy some fatigues so he can look the part too.", " NTA.

I might sound a bit harsh here but tbh, he should either get a job and get his own clothes or respect you enough to atleast not ruin ur clothes.", "NTA - at 20, you both are still pretty young.  I would suggest some counselling to root out the actual problem and why he is acting this way since it seems to be rather passive-aggressive about something.  At best, you will know what is going on and maybe it will be something fixable; at worst, he will refuse and you know will know it is doomed.\n\nIf you feel bad that he can't currently afford to buy clothing, offer to buy him something just wear for paintball as a present.  How he acts when you offer this and after will be telling.

What true companionship is. What love is. The fact that just bc someone does something that annoys you, does not mean you should immediately abandon your relationship. My gf does annoying shit with my clothes too, and according to y\u2019all I should leave her bc of it, not knowing/understanding/caring that she\u2019s my best friend in the entire world and would do anything for me. For every thing she does that annoys me, they\u2019re are 50 things that I adore. So no, don\u2019t leave your relationship because your bf is fucking up your clothes and isn\u2019t working. Just talk to him and out your foot down. It\u2019s easy for any normal person to understand to stop fucking up my shit bc it angers me. Simple. By next week he can have a new job, and new clothes, and you\u2019ll be thinking damn did I really throw my relationship away for that?

Just because you make enough to support you guys doesn't mean you should have to keep spending money to replace clothing! \n\nHe's being absolutely disrespectful by continuing to take your clothes despite telling him not to, and then ruining them.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with being a single income couple - as long as you've both agreed to it. I'd be willing to bet that if you live together, he sits around all day doing nothing (sleeping half the day, playing video games, watching TV, playing paintball, etc) while you work all day - then come home and have to do all the chores by yourself (laundry, cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc).

You're in a codependent relationship. He's playing you like a fiddle. He's playing the long con here and this isn't the first step of his weaponized incompetence. What's his is his and what's yours is his, too.\n\nLet's get the laundry and clothes topic out of the way. You used to do his laundry alongside yours. A year ago you took a stance and refused to do his laundry. He's wearing your clothes because you won't do his laundry, but by wearing YOUR clothes and you do wash those, then by all intents and purposes, you ARE doing his laundry. He outmaneuvered you and you can't even see it because you feel guilty about your attempt to demand the bare fucking minimum of respect. Now you're on Reddit asking if YOU did something wrong? Jesus H. Christ. \n\nHe has access to the savings and balances. He knows how much he's contributed and he can do basic addition and subtraction to realize he's burned through his portion of the contributions and then some.

Now you're telling him that he needs to get a job, so he resents you and wants to use childish excuses. \n\nGetting a replacement Social Security card and birth certificate are not difficult. It's a pain in the ass and can be time consuming, but doesn't work right now. He has all of the time in the world to go handle his personal affairs and get new copies of his missing documents. The fact that you even have to have this conversation with him is comical. If he is showing these signs right now, it's going to get way, way worse before there's a glimmer of hope it'll ever get better. You will waste your entire 20s with him and then you'll be at 14 years in. At that point, with your current mindset, you'll stay indefinitely due to the sunk cost fallacy. Break up with him now. Kick him out of your apartment. Cut all ties. If he's unable to cope on his own, that alone tells you that he's not capable of being an equal partner now or in the future. \n\nWork seasonally.

Itll just be resentment building up for months or years in between the moments of you thinking about how you care about him and want him to be better.\n\nIm not going to tell you what your boundaries should be as thats a choice for you to make, but I will suggest that along with anything you think of, him not doing anything like you said (refusing therapy, refusing anti-depressants, etc) and choosing to stay as he is right now is not something you should accept. He wont get better that way, neither of you will end up happy and itll lead to a more bitter break up down the line fueled by resentment on your end (along with you having a lot less money saved up). You arent a therapist, or psychologist or any kind of doctor, youre just a regular person who really cares about someone, but you need to look out for yourself too because even if you were any of those other things, a therapist cant help someone who doesnt want help.

Truth is that I couldn\u2019t and I was actually enabling him to do nothing to try and help himself because I was doing everything.  He never wanted therapy or medication or psychologist or even a medical check up. He refused to consider anything that could possibly help him and once I finally opened my eyes I realized something really important:  you can\u2019t help someone that doesn\u2019t want to help themselves.  You can do literally everything right for someone to pick them up onto their feet but if they don\u2019t want to stand, it doesn\u2019t matter what you do.

I saw what my shitty depression behavior did to my very supportive boyfriend, and decided I didn't want to add to his problems. I wanted to be better so we could have a happy life together. Changing that is hard af, trust me, but it was worth it.\n\nIn my instance, I was in therapy and on meds for years with very little improvement. I stopped meds and realized that they were treating the symptoms but not the problem, and that was on me to change. Meds made me hazy and hard to think, but I know tons of people who are benefited from meds, so its up to him if he wants to try them or not. Therapy gave me some coping methods, but I didn't try as hard until I actively decided I didn't like the depressed mess that I was letting myself stay, and its been a journey of stopping myself before I spiral. But it's made our relationship so much better, we're both so happy, and it was something I never though possible until I met him, and decided I wanted to be better bc he deserved the best.\n\nAnyways, I know this was about the shirts, but since I read down this thread this far, I thought I would share my two cents as someone who was the depressed mooch at one point. I still don't have a job, but I clean and cook, and side hustle on Mercari and Ebay for a little extra cash for us. I just wanted to add my anecdote that it is possible to get better. But only IF true effort is made, of course.\n\n I always want to end my advice that if he shows no effort to change, its not your obligation to stay with him. If I never made an effort, and my bf left, I wouldn't blame him on that. People deserve happiness, and support, but if they won't try to, then that support becomes a burden", "Time to bounce.
