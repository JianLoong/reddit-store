From this post, it sounds like it\u2019s not much.", "INFO: Why doesn't he wear his own clothes to paintball? Why does he have to wear yours? He's obviously not worried about the paint, so... Why?", "Info. Why doesn\u2019t he have a job? \n\nNTA at all, I\u2019m just curious why he\u2019s unable to support himself but is fine with ruining your things. You don\u2019t need to justify saying no. He needs to respect that and stop borrowing your clothes.", "NTA\nHe's using your clothes instead of his own because he knows he will ruin them. And 2-3 weeks to wash them in unacceptable.  He doesn't get to ruin your clothes because he can't afford his own.", "NTA. If he can\u2019t afford to buy his own clothes - although doesn\u2019t already own clothes????? - how can he afford to play paintball?  And why does he not do the laundry to contribute to the household you are supporting?  Time to reevaluate your relationship.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he needs to just wash his own clothes and stop getting yours dirty.", "NTA.  Nothing inherently wrong with sharing clothes, but dude here is using OP's stuff like rags and not even washing them regularly.  Wasteful and disrespectful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep reusing the same ones until they wear out.", "NTA. He's intentionally destroying your property. Shouldn't he be looking for a job not playing paintball? And why can't he just use the same outfit over and over again?", "NTA. Just because you are in a relationship does not mean that either of you are entitled to free access to any of the other\u2019s possessions at any time. If you want to say that he can\u2019t wear your clothes, you can do so at any time. Especially since it\u2019s obvious that he is only doing so to keep his clothes from getting dirty. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are making enough to support both of you or not - it\u2019s a matter of respect for the other party. If he truly respected you, he would have been washing the clothes as soon as he got back after paintball, at the very least, and he would have stopped wearing them when you asked. He also would have understood that, because you are the only one with an income, that you have a measure of control in this relationship.", "NTA. What's yours is yours.  He doesn't get to decide yours is his, and expect you should go away with it.\n\nHe can get a job.  They are everywhere.  Don't feel bad for arguing.  You are an adult. You get to want what you want, and stand up for yourself when someone else tries to tell you you don't.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to allow him to borrow your clothes at all, nor he you.  But for a *damaging* activity where even when it's not his own clothes he can't be bothered to wash them until stains set in?  Oh hell no.  He can set aside an outfit of his own that's specifically for paintball.\n\nHe doesn't have a job and so can't afford to buy a cheap pair of jeans and a t-shirt, but he can afford a new paintball hobby?", "YTA a bit to yourself. He's acting as if he's some toddler that's unable to learn or understand what he's being told. He's not going to change and he's shown you that hes not going to change. \n\nYou need to treat people like they teach you to treat them. Right now, your BF is telling you that he doesn't care about what you want.\n\nI suggest reading this before reading the rest of my comment. It's written by a guy who was doing similar things as your BF. [She left me for leaving dishes by the sink.](https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_9055288)\n\nAt this point, it's not about the shirts. It's about basic respect. Asking your BF but to not wear your shirts has become asking him to respect you enough not to wear them. You've communicated clearly. He's making you ask him to treat you like an equal partner and human being and repeatedly saying NO.", "You have every right not wanting him to wear your things just because they fit, especially since he isn\u2019t taking care of it. \nI have issues with people like him. Getting a job isn\u2019t hard (may not be what you want) to make some side money to go thrifting for clothes he can still like and be okay with ruining.", "Must be some good D to put up with all that I've read in the comments. You do you.", "This and he can\u2019t afford clothes of his own for this activity but can afford to play paintball?", "He's not worried about the paint because it's not his clothes.", "Because he doesn\u2019t wash his clothes. We moved into a new apartment and still have to buy a small washer and dryer. I\u2019ve been going to a friends house since I don\u2019t like laundry mats, he makes no effort to do so since I stopped washing his clothes for him.", "Yea some of his old good for nothing else clothes, which he isn't afraid to get dirty and full of paint.", "Yeah he can run around playing paintball( with OPs assistance I assume) but can\u2019t get a job?", "We prefer to work seasonally. Typically 8 months on 4 months off so we can travel. I went back to work two weeks ago and probably will leave around may.", "Yup. We don\u2019t have a washer/ dryer yet because we just moved. But there\u2019s a mat down the street and friends that let us use their washer and dryer often.", "I pay for the paintball because it\u2019s something he really enjoys. I love seeing how excited he gets to go play with his team and I genuinely don\u2019t mind paying for it, it\u2019s the use of my clothes that I feel is disrespectful.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. It\u2019s cheap t shirts from Walmart/Marshall\u2019s but it\u2019s still wasteful regardless of the price.", "OP never said he wasn\u2019t looking for a job. I agree NTA, but people who are looking for work are also allowed to maintain hobbies.", "It bothers me because we agree on everything else. He does the chores and maintenance while I work and take care of everything financially. I\u2019m not sure why this exact situation isn\u2019t clear to him.", "Lmao. We\u2019ve been together for 4 years, almost 5 and I really love him. He\u2019s gotten lazy and I want him to get his act together. I\u2019m not gonna give up on him because of petty arguments.", "Exactly, so many red flags here. It doesn\u2019t matter if OP makes enough money to support the both of him - he sounds like a mooch.", "He has gear and the padded pants and shirt. The inside of it is rough so he wears a t shirt under. Idk why he has to wear a different t shirt every time he goes because NOBODY sees it under the gear.", "Oh my gosh. This guy sounds so lazy and immature. I hope you see that.", "You're NTA it is about time someone doesn't coddle him. He has no job whatsoever. I wonder where he gets this childish behaviour from as it can't be out of the blue.", "Well you need to have more than one conversation with that man. See, I do my partners laundry, but not because my man won't. Its a compromise that I offered him. I tell my partner to keep his dirty clothes off the bedroom floor and into the basket, and im fine washing them with my own clothes. And it works. I get something, he gets something.\n\nMaybe there's some kind of middle ground yous can come to at the very least.", "Yup I bought all his gear for his birthday a few months ago. We work seasonally so I just went back to my job two weeks ago and he\u2019s looking for one, I was being a little petty during the argument.", "That\u2019s completely fair. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t ruin your thing no matter the situation though. It\u2019s just basic courtesy especially for your significant other.", "Well if he's not working be has plenty of time to go get his own clothes cleaned. His options here should be stop or move out", "You really need to sit down and have a serious conversation with him, because he is being disrespectful to you, especially because you seem to be contributing a lot more to the relationship than he is. It sounds like you love him very much, but if he can\u2019t or won\u2019t respect your feelings and your things now, it\u2019s probably going to get worse not better as time goes by. If I tell my husband something bothers me, he stops doing it, and I do the same for him. If you truly love someone, you respect them. Little things can add up, and become big issues. I hope that he sees how important this is to you and that everything works out, but stand your ground. You deserve to be treated with love and respect.", "He just started a new hobby that destroys her things. I doubt paintball is free either. \n\nHe can keep busy while unemployed but he still needs to respect her property. It's funny how he knows not to use his clothes but somehow her clothes are fair game. It's rude!", "You\u2019re missing the point.  He shouldn\u2019t be playing he should be working no matter how much you make."]}
