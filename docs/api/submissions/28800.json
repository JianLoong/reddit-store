My husband (46) has 4 kids (13F,11M,8F,6F) with his ex wife. Their divorce was very amicable and he gladly pays for his ex\u2019s home and cash support as she was a SAHM. This amounts to close to 8k a month. He makes 250k (15k month net) while I make 400k (around 23k a month, varies). I would guess his ex makes 60k a year now.\n\nWe live in a high cost of living city so Ex's house is only 3 beds and ours is 4 beds (almost 10k a month). Before marrying me he lived in a studio down the street and he would take the kids during his days but put them to bed at her house. I lived in a two bedroom paying 4k, so my daughter had her own room. Now, his kids share a room at our house when they are here 30% of the time. We have an uneven amount of kids and can\u2019t afford a 6 bedroom. I have put my daughter in her own bedroom. She\u2019s only 2 months younger than my oldest stepdaughter and is with us almost all the time. Her father is out of state and I receive meager child support.\n\nBetween that and my daughter attending private school (started 2 years ago before we married), I pay a little less than half my salary every month to tuition and mortgage payments. \n\nEx wife is now asking my husband to either allow my oldest stepdaughter or stepson to have their own bedroom, and to send all the kids to private school. Quite frankly, we can\u2019t afford it. I am making great money now but was basically paycheck to paycheck most of my daughter\u2019s life. I pretty much decimated my retirement and got into big debt (100k) to start my business that just started thriving last year.\n\nShe is claiming I am treating my child like the favorite. I have always instilled academic values in my child- she has never received anything less than an A and has a lot of dreams. The other kids are great kids but they do not value education as much. I\u2019m not judging, just evaluating, but the kids are different. They have been raised differently, and that's fine.\n\nI told my husband we can consider private school for each kid individually as they get older and  they possibly get more academic rigor but sending 5 kids to private school is just out of the question. I feel like I am being expected to foot this bill because I am successful but I also have my long term financial security to work out. He has a healthy retirement (to which ex is entitled to half) and I have nothing to fall back on if my industry gets a downturn. My career is half his career\u2019s age, I do not have wealth like he has.\n\nI asked my daughter if she was ok sharing a room with her stepsister, and she said she would prefer not to since the kids are messy. \n\nAITA for not wanting to pay for all my stepkids private schooling and changing up rooms?", "created_utc": 1697150176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176jndn/wibta_if_i_didnt_pay_for_my_stepkids_private/", "score": 723, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep finances separate except for house expenses. Put that in a joint account. Why is his ex demanding anything?  Your husband needs to tell her to mind her business.

In addition, you are paying for it out of your own pocket, your husband doesn't contribute. \n\nIf they want their kids going private too, they need to figure it out with their finances, and not to bring yours into it. If you want to contribute, that's fine, but they shouldn't expect it to happen. It starts with private school, which will turn to colleges, and soon enough you'll be 55 with no retirement plan and none of your debts settled because you've been paying for private schools and college tuition for 4 other kids for 20 years.\n\nRegarding the bedrooms, that's a bit different. Personally, I'm an advocate that sharing bedrooms should be normalized. Unfortunately, in some countries (I'm looking at you, USA), people have this ridiculously stupid idea that each kid should have their own bedroom, as if humanity began sometime in the 1800s and will end in Pittsburgh PA whenever. The world has 8B people, and in most of it, kids share bedrooms (yes, even in France and England).\n\nThe bedroom situation at your place is exactly the same as at ex-wifes place. So the kids should be used to it, and I see no reasons for complaining. Having said this, there is an argument to be made for the boy not to share a bedroom with his sister once he hits puberty (in both households). I think however that no changes need to be made for another 1 to 2 years, but it needs to be evaluated case to case as not all kids are the same. \n\nSince your husband's kids spend about 8 days a month with you guys, you could contemplate either:\n- moving 11M in with his younger sisters, giving the 13F the bedroom she desires.\n- moving 13F with your daughter for those 8 days a month, giving 11M the bedroom.\n- moving 13F with your daughter for those 8 days a month, and 11M with younger sisters, giving parents the office they desire.\n\nHowever, it seems to me that no changes are required at the moment. \n\nFinally, I'd like to add that although you're making the most money now, that could change in the future. So you should take advantage of this opportunity to setup a retirement fund and make further savings aimed at moving to a bigger home later or adding a bedroom in the future (if there's space). Kids will continue to grow, and the oldest kids will continue to come back home often for at least another 10 years so getting these dynamics down will be important. \n\nIt seems that your communication is very strong, so keep those lines of communication open and honest, and that's more than half of the hard work done.\n\nNTA", "NTA with a caveat: In my state, it's strongly suggested that kids share a room only with their own gender, which would land his son in his own room and the two 13YO girls still sharing a room.
