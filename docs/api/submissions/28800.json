My husband (46) has 4 kids (13F,11M,8F,6F) with his ex wife. Their divorce was very amicable and he gladly pays for his ex\u2019s home and cash support as she was a SAHM. This amounts to close to 8k a month. He makes 250k (15k month net) while I make 400k (around 23k a month, varies). I would guess his ex makes 60k a year now.\n\nWe live in a high cost of living city so Ex's house is only 3 beds and ours is 4 beds (almost 10k a month). Before marrying me he lived in a studio down the street and he would take the kids during his days but put them to bed at her house. I lived in a two bedroom paying 4k, so my daughter had her own room. Now, his kids share a room at our house when they are here 30% of the time. We have an uneven amount of kids and can\u2019t afford a 6 bedroom. I have put my daughter in her own bedroom. She\u2019s only 2 months younger than my oldest stepdaughter and is with us almost all the time. Her father is out of state and I receive meager child support.\n\nBetween that and my daughter attending private school (started 2 years ago before we married), I pay a little less than half my salary every month to tuition and mortgage payments. \n\nEx wife is now asking my husband to either allow my oldest stepdaughter or stepson to have their own bedroom, and to send all the kids to private school. Quite frankly, we can\u2019t afford it. I am making great money now but was basically paycheck to paycheck most of my daughter\u2019s life. I pretty much decimated my retirement and got into big debt (100k) to start my business that just started thriving last year.\n\nShe is claiming I am treating my child like the favorite. I have always instilled academic values in my child- she has never received anything less than an A and has a lot of dreams. The other kids are great kids but they do not value education as much. I\u2019m not judging, just evaluating, but the kids are different. They have been raised differently, and that's fine.\n\nI told my husband we can consider private school for each kid individually as they get older and  they possibly get more academic rigor but sending 5 kids to private school is just out of the question. I feel like I am being expected to foot this bill because I am successful but I also have my long term financial security to work out. He has a healthy retirement (to which ex is entitled to half) and I have nothing to fall back on if my industry gets a downturn. My career is half his career\u2019s age, I do not have wealth like he has.\n\nI asked my daughter if she was ok sharing a room with her stepsister, and she said she would prefer not to since the kids are messy. \n\nAITA for not wanting to pay for all my stepkids private schooling and changing up rooms?", "created_utc": 1697150176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176jndn/wibta_if_i_didnt_pay_for_my_stepkids_private/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Keep finances separate except for house expenses. Put that in a joint account. Why is his ex demanding anything?  Your husband needs to tell her to mind her business.

Should have said \"we\".", "Im actually not that salty about the spousal support, but we do have a 4 bedroom instead of a two bedroom because of his kids.", "Get a post nup or honestly divorce. No offense but you put yourself in a very messed up situation and the ones that are going to get hurt are you and your daughter. If your husband won\u2019t sign a post nup then you have your answer as to how things will go. You don\u2019t see anything wrong with the fact he wants you to pay for things when you don\u2019t hVe a retirement fund? Get him to sign or get out.", "It read to me like he is paying considerably more than he is legally obliged to do, did I get that wrong? As far as the mortgage being higher because you have a four bedroom house, I think that's fair as long as your % ownership of the home reflects what you put in. I say that because you chose to be with somebody knowing it would be necessary to have a bigger home.", "If she has a 3 bedroom, and you have a 4, shouldn\u2019t the rooming arrangements be the same in both houses? 1 bedroom for parents, 1 bedroom for group one of husband/ex\u2019s kids- I\u2019m assuming the son, 1 bedroom for group 2 of husband/ex\u2019s kids- I\u2019m assuming the girls? You have the 4th for your daughter, ex doesn\u2019t have a 4th bedroom.  And your daughter is with you most of the time. \n\nYou mentioned him paying the mortgage on the ex\u2019s home, is he on the title? \n\nHow much extra beyond the court agreement is he paying? Is it being documented? \n\nOP NTA, she\u2019s seeing you pay private school tuition for your daughter, but that\u2019s coming out of your salary.  Your salary isn\u2019t meant to supplement child support.  \n\nHow much of your salary are you saving towards retirement? And have you paid off the loan you took out to start your business?", "There are parts of his support that hes legally obligated to, and other parts that could be reevaluated based on her new income. It hasnt been worth the headache because we are doing well and didn't want to cause fights - except now we are in one. \n\nAs for the house, I am not saying its unfair. But I do think the comment that the majority of the bills at my house are because of me and my daughter is wrong.", "The rooming arrangements are the same, but its not quite what you said. The 11 and 13 year old share a room (boy and girl) and the two little girls share a room.\n\nHe is on the title to his ex's home. He isnt paying beyond what they agreed in the divorce but it should be reevaluated based on her working - maybe a couple thousand max he is overpaying. Not enough for private school. \n\nI hate to say it, but I havent started saving towards retirement. Not paid off my loans. My extra income this past year went towards the down payment of our home (which he paid a little more than me). We have had a \"do what you can\" attitude towards our finances but I really need to get a grip on mine and private school is out of the question.", "It definitely sounds like it's time for you to sit down with him and discuss things. I can understand not rocking the boat when things were peaceful, but there are two situations to resolve here. You need to start by discussing things with your husband and come to an agreement about your finances before you start discussing what to do about his ex-wife. But you are definitely NTA on the original question. it is not your job to pay for private schooling for his children, and that includes subsidising him so that he can do it. He needs to understand that you cannot pay for anything else until you have covered all debts and your retirement fund. Too many women leave themselves financially vulnerable and regret it later. I can understand prioritising your child over your own well-being, but it's not your job to prioritise anyone else's."]}
