Americans just seem to always have terrible managers and terrible employment practices.  I'm so sorry you were put in such an awkward spot.  He should be getting a budget from head office, no?  Especially for a consulting firm, my god. But even just the fact that an event was scheduled on a holiday.  Ask the other teams tomorrow what their experience has been with their team building stuff and get their reactions.  If they have more normal experiences, you might be able to submit a complaint to someone above him, at least to get that pressure off you.", "NTA.

Id be taking this higher up the chain of command.\n\nMy policy has been and always will be that anything work related, supplies, events, uniforms, I won't pay for it.\n\nThey can't just deduct it from your check either.

Report it and find a new job.", "Paying to go to work on a stat holiday? Hell no. Sounds illegal to me. I hope your office has an HR department (and if that fails and they take your money from your cheque, that where you live has an employment standards agency and a decent job market for you to turn to). NTA.", "On top of that, since it\u2019s mandatory - they had to pay you to be there. \n\nAnd it\u2019s a holiday? Check your contract and local labor laws. They may have even had to pay you time and a half if you\u2019re hourly/non-exempt.\n\n(That\u2019s assuming you\u2019rethe US, but dickhole boss pulling that seemed like a safe bet it\u2019s probably US lol)", "I would agree except for the usage of \"paycheque\"", "Absolutely NTA. something like this happened to me recently on a school choir trip. We were doing a guest service at a cathedral and we were told we were going to pizza express afterwards as a reward. A few days afterwards, everyone's parents got emailed telling them that everyone was getting charged \u00a320 for the meal.

You need to complain to HR, both about being asked to pay and about being mandated to work on a holiday, especially with no notice. Your wages should not be garnished for this, and you should also be getting overtime pay for working on the holiday. Make sure to print out/ make copies on everything to do with this event so that you have proof, but do not accept this.", "Nta.  Boss needs to pay for everyone.  And pay them to attend the event", "NTA. And judging by you're wording, you might be Canadian. If that's the case, make sure you speak with HR to tell them your boss is threatening to make an illegal payroll deduction and apparently doesn't plan to provide you with Stat holiday pay after telling you it was mandatory to attend a work function on the stat, and if there's anything funny about your pay, you WILL be reporting it. Oh, and mention that your manager also has allowed, if not encouraged, other employees to engage in reprisals against you for asserting your rights.", "I'm assuming you're not in the US because this bs would be straight up illegal. I don't know where you live, but you're NTA in any part of the world.", "If you want to really burn some bridges over this, draw up an invoice for your time (using consultancy rates NOT your hourly wage), multiply by time and a half or double time for it being on a statutory holiday, then add on a late notice fee.

A cursory googling suggests Australia and New Zealand haven't had a staturltory holiday recently where as Canada has. The other option is Scotland which also had a recent holiday but as you say there's a currency unit discrepancy.", "Aussies also get state specific holidays. It forever grinds my gears Melburnians get more holidays than us Sydneysiders.", "The US isn\u2019t the only place with states.
