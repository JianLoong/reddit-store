For the most part he is not all that interested in wedding planning. However, there is one major part of our wedding that is causing lots of issues between us, and that is deciding how large of a wedding we should have. I've always imagined a medium sized wedding of maybe 60 guests. The idea of planning and paying for a wedding with 100+ sounds exhausting and wouldn't create the wedding I've always dreamed of.\n\nThe problem, however, is that my fianc\u00e9 has a very large family that are all fairly close. He has 6 full siblings, 3 older half-siblings, 4 younger half-siblings, 3 stepsiblings plus 2 former stepsiblings he's close to. He has 14 nieces/nephews and 6 great-nieces/nephews. His dad is one of 9 so he has lots of cousins (1st, 2nd, 3rd). He has 3 living grandparents (+4 step grandparents) and 3 living great-grandparents.\n\nThis isn't a family that only see each other at weddings, funerals and the occasional reunion, they are actually in each other\u2019s lives and have a close bond. The family he wants to invite is already way over 60 and that's before we even consider some of their spouses.\n\nMy family is a lot smaller. I have my parents plus my unmarried younger sister. My dad has one sister who is married with one daughter and my mom has a brother and a sister and they each have 2 children. I have one living grandparent and am not close with my more extended family so will not be inviting them to my wedding.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I also have a large group of friends and our non-negotiable friend invites come to 27.\n\nI've suggested to my fianc\u00e9 that he should pick 30-40 family members he wants in attendance so that his family isn't so heavily represented compared to mine. He will still have double the family I do if he does manage to narrow it down. I also suggested doing a seperate party at his dad's house in his hometown before or after the wedding where he could invite any of the family he wants, and they wouldn't have to travel far.\n\nHowever, my fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm being an asshole because I don't want 70+ of his rowdy family members at my wedding. One of my friends also agrees with him and thinks a larger wedding will be fun and that my fianc\u00e9 won't enjoy the day as much if he feels there's people missing. My future FIL has also been pressuring me about a larger wedding and has offered to pay to facilitate this. I don't think I'm being an asshole about this and neither do my parents, they agree that the groom\u2019s family shouldn't so heavily outweigh mine.

I get it that it's overbearing, but if his family is that important to him, he would feel really bad about it. Also, imagine the excluded family members' feelings about not making the invitations. Maybe tty to compromise, like a smaller ceremony with just you two, parents and vitnesses and a bigger dinner with everyone. My uncle and his second wife did this, they had a separate occasion actually for the party part as the bride's family couldn't make it due to living in another country, and it was actually great.", "YTA. It's his wedding too and his family he's close to. Plus his family is willing to pay.

It was great that we had all of OUR friends and family in attendance and it made for a great party.", "YTA - you are literally demanding that you get everyone special to you and he gets what\u20261/3?  \n\nIm usually a supporter of having the wedding you want, but this is just the wedding YOU want, not what your FI wants.

He will still have double the family I do if he does manage to narrow it down.\n\nSo? They're his family. He didn't choose them but they are important to him. This isn't a popularity contest or an accounting exercise, but that's a very selfish reason to exclude them.\n\n> I also suggested doing a seperate party at his dad's house in his hometown before or after the wedding where he could invite any of the family he wants, and they wouldn't have to travel far.\n\nWhy should he have to offer a consolation prize when he wants them at the main event?\n\n> However, my fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm being an asshole because I don't want 70+ of his rowdy family members at * **my** * wedding.

Calling it **my** wedding really shows your true colours. A wedding joins two families. If you're not prepared to do that, are you actually compatible?

Because it sounds like you see the wedding as your event and he's just conveniently invited.\n\nETA: Correction. You refer to it as \"our wedding\" in your response to the judgement bot, but that's literally the only place. The actual main post, you still act like it's your wedding only.", "YTA, it really sounds like you just don\u2019t like that he\u2019s inviting more people than you.

His family put pressure on me to only invite some of my family because they worried about the imbalance of representation. When I talked to my (now) husband about it, he said he would never dream of asking me not to invite the most important people to me on one of the most important days of our lives. He knew it would make me feel like something was missing from our day. You said he doesn\u2019t really care about wedding planning. So I\u2019m going to guess you have got to plan a lot of the wedding your way. If this is one of his few requests I would give it to him. After all it\u2019s not just your wedding. Also, if extra people ruin your vision for your wedding.. you have a VERY specific vision..", "YTA.\nHaving your family and his family attend your wedding in equal numbers is not a thing.

So they're considering themselves as your family already, but you can't seem to see them as your family. The wedding would be an opportunity to celebrate the family (values and members) you're joining and show them you know what it means to be a part of this family.

If you don't want your small family to be greatly outnumbered don't date someone with an immediate family size of 100 people. Also, how exactly do you expect to be accepted by his very close family that gets together all the time if your only reason why his aunt wasn't invited is \"I told him only x number of his relatives could be invited\"?

And ask him to get more involved with the planning so the two of you can decide together what is important and what you can save money on.

There aren't any financial issues here, because your future FIL is willing to pay for the increased cost. As a \"compromise\", you suggest that your fianc\u00e9 have a B-list party for his family instead of inviting them to the wedding.

The rest was my husbands family and our friends.", "YTA.", "YTA. I get that it must be stressful to plan for a bigger wedding, but what you should be asking from your fianc\u00e9 is his help with planning, not a cut on the guest list.

They are obviously close so why would he not invite them to the wedding? It shouldn\u2019t matter that his family is bigger than yours that\u2019s just the way it is. He\u2019s not just inviting them for the sake of it. If I was you I would also get used to the idea that going forward any family events you have are going to involve a huge amount of people.

You chose a man with a big family, a close family. What\u2019s more important, the wedding or the marriage?", "YTA. This wedding is about BOTH YOU AND YOUR FIANCE. The merging of two families. It's not all about you.\n\nMy BIL's family photo was less than 20 people. My Sister's family was like a damn senior class photo. 120-something people.

The fact of the matter is he does have more family than you. It\u2019s not a competition. A wedding is supposed to be a celebration of the beginning of your lives together. It sounds like he\u2019s very close to his family regardless of how large it is, so why shouldn\u2019t he have them at an important event to celebrate with him? It sounds like you\u2019re pretty selfish and I hope your fianc\u00e9 is noticing this. YTA", "OP, you seem to be thinking that marriage somehow is just between the two of you. While yes, of course, it's just you two getting married, and yes you should have each other's back first over family in most situations, know right now that you are marrying his family just as much as him.\n\nIf you exclude his close family now.... what kind of start to marriage is this? You understand that he is very close with them, right? That he's probably not going to pick you over them? You have to fit in with the family, or your marriage likely won't work. \n\nAgain don't get me wrong, if he's putting them over you every single day and your needs never get met, different story, but don't expect that he will suddenly not be close with his family once you're married, that's not how it works.", "Yta, do want to have a wedding, or do you want to be married to another human?", "YTA. This isn\u2019t just your wedding. It\u2019s his wedding, too. His family isn\u2019t \u201coutweighing\u201d yours. It isn\u2019t a competition. He just has more relatives than you.", "YTA. You are marrying into a large family. All events will be like this. If it bothers you call off the wedding. It\u2019s not just your wedding. Your fil has offered to cover the cost.

You deamed.of a 60 person wedding....  but then you decided to marry a man with a different dream.  He wants his siblings, parents, and grandparents at his wedding.

If your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t helping plan the wedding at all, it\u2019s even more frustrating. My advice would be to have a destination wedding, on a weekday. That will naturally cut your guest-list down, without offending anyone. \n\nInfo: who\u2019s paying for the wedding?", "NAH. I don\u2019t really think either of you are wrong for your wants. I think you need to have a realistic conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about what your budget is. A lot of venues will give you a cost per person if you\u2019re doing dinner/drinks. That will give you a better idea of actually how big of a wedding you can afford. I understand the wedding celebration is for family, but unfortunately when you take someone\u2019s money, you are opening yourself to a wedding that includes what they want - which may be the reason why OP doesn\u2019t want to take FIL up on his offer of $$$. Weddings are tricky. I had the same issue with my family and we decided on a very small wedding with immediate family only and no friends or family.

If not, he can trim the list.", "I think slight NTA. It\u2019s not just your wedding. But he needs to help you plan the wedding if he wants his huge family there. He isn\u2019t allowed to be uninterested in wedding planning if he wants every single family member there. It\u2019s not fair to leave all the planning to OP.

Don't start with your compromise (double your family) start the conversation again with equal guests on both sides then meet in the middle from there.\n\nFind the total cost needed for guests (venue, drinks, entrees, cake etc...) and divide it by the number attending.

For the most part he is not all that interested in wedding planning. However, there is one major part of our wedding that is causing lots of issues between us, and that is deciding how large of a wedding we should have. I've always imagined a medium sized wedding of maybe 60 guests. The idea of planning and paying for a wedding with 100+ sounds exhausting and wouldn't create the weeding I've always dreamed of.\n\n\rThe problem, however, is that my fianc\u00e9 has a very large family that are all fairly close. He has 6 full siblings, 3 older half-siblings, 4 younger half-siblings, 3 stepsiblings plus 2 former stepsiblings he's close to. He has 14 nieces/nephews and 6 great-nieces/nephews. His dad is one of 9 so he has lots of cousins (1st, 2nd, 3rd). He has 3 living grandparents (+4 step grandparents) and 3 living great-grandparents.\n\n\rThis isn't a family that only see each other at weddings, funerals and the occasional reunion, they are actually in each other\u2019s lives and have a close bond. The family he wants to invite is already way over 60 and that's before we even consider some of their spouses. \n\n\rMy family is a lot smaller. I have my parents plus my unmarried younger sister. My dad has one sister who is married with one daughter and my mom has a brother and a sister and they each have 2 children. I have one living grandparent and am not close with my more extended family so will not be inviting them to my wedding.\n\n\rMy fianc\u00e9 and I also have a large group of friends and our non-negotiable friend invites come to 27.\r  \nI've suggested to my fianc\u00e9 that he should pick 30-40 family members he wants in attendance so that his family isn't so heavily represented compared to mine. He will still have double the family I do if he does manage to narrow it down. I also suggested doing a seperate party at his dad's house in his hometown before or after the wedding where he could invite any of the family he wants, and they wouldn't have to travel far.\n\n\rHowever, my fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm being an asshole because I don't want 70+ of his rowdy family members at my wedding. One of my friends also agrees with him and thinks a larger wedding will be fun and that my fianc\u00e9 won't enjoy the day as much if he feels there's people missing. My future FIL has also been pressuring me about a larger wedding and has offered to pay to facilitate this. I don't think I'm being an asshole about this and neither do my parents, they agree that the groom\u2019s family shouldn't so heavily outweigh mine.

It's about the aesthetic. The feel. I come from a relatively compact family. Christmas was my parents and us three kids. Sometimes my unmarried aunt from out-of-state. The rest of our family was always several states and hundreds of miles away. When we had Thanksgiving dinner it was the same.There were five or six of us and we ate at the (fancy) dining room table with a nice tablecloth and the fine china and silverware. We served our food with nice serving bowls, platters and serving spoons.\n\nI have spent many Thanksgivings since then with my married friends and his side of the family. It's often 35 to 40 people in a relatively small house. There is no fancy tablecloth, silverwere, china or fancy dining room. It's all disposable plates and utensils. Sometimes you are lucky if you get a spot on the couch to sit down while you eat. Of course it's crowded and busy with that many people but I'm not complaining at all and I'm happy they have me. But it's a completely different vibe and I could see how someone who came from a family like mine and was used to that kind of family Thanksgiving might feel a little off balance in that kind of situation - eating with loads of people whose names you aren't even sure of (I had a cheat sheet I used to study before I went).

Them offering to pay for more people is probably the opposite of what she really wants, deep down. She wants the kind of wedding that would happen in her family - smaller but classier (remember, she called his family \"rowdy\"*). Neither she nor her fiance is inherently wrong about what they envision, but it's a problem that they have different visions. As others have said, this problem will not go away for her. It will come up at every family gathering. In practical terms, she either has to reconcile herself to the fact that she is joining a large, close-knit family and embrace it or prepare to be regularly unhappy (or, ultimately, activate the nuclear option and call it off).

Then if we were taking them out for a bit for pictures or to show them off to family we rarely see, we had to mark a box so they didn't worry they lost a child, then we'd mark another box when we brought them back.
