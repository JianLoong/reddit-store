For the most part he is not all that interested in wedding planning. However, there is one major part of our wedding that is causing lots of issues between us, and that is deciding how large of a wedding we should have. I've always imagined a medium sized wedding of maybe 60 guests. The idea of planning and paying for a wedding with 100+ sounds exhausting and wouldn't create the wedding I've always dreamed of.\n\nThe problem, however, is that my fianc\u00e9 has a very large family that are all fairly close. He has 6 full siblings, 3 older half-siblings, 4 younger half-siblings, 3 stepsiblings plus 2 former stepsiblings he's close to. He has 14 nieces/nephews and 6 great-nieces/nephews. His dad is one of 9 so he has lots of cousins (1st, 2nd, 3rd). He has 3 living grandparents (+4 step grandparents) and 3 living great-grandparents.\n\nThis isn't a family that only see each other at weddings, funerals and the occasional reunion, they are actually in each other\u2019s lives and have a close bond. The family he wants to invite is already way over 60 and that's before we even consider some of their spouses.\n\nMy family is a lot smaller. I have my parents plus my unmarried younger sister. My dad has one sister who is married with one daughter and my mom has a brother and a sister and they each have 2 children. I have one living grandparent and am not close with my more extended family so will not be inviting them to my wedding.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I also have a large group of friends and our non-negotiable friend invites come to 27.\n\nI've suggested to my fianc\u00e9 that he should pick 30-40 family members he wants in attendance so that his family isn't so heavily represented compared to mine. He will still have double the family I do if he does manage to narrow it down. I also suggested doing a seperate party at his dad's house in his hometown before or after the wedding where he could invite any of the family he wants, and they wouldn't have to travel far.\n\nHowever, my fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm being an asshole because I don't want 70+ of his rowdy family members at my wedding. One of my friends also agrees with him and thinks a larger wedding will be fun and that my fianc\u00e9 won't enjoy the day as much if he feels there's people missing. My future FIL has also been pressuring me about a larger wedding and has offered to pay to facilitate this. I don't think I'm being an asshole about this and neither do my parents, they agree that the groom\u2019s family shouldn't so heavily outweigh mine.

I get it that it's overbearing, but if his family is that important to him, he would feel really bad about it. Also, imagine the excluded family members' feelings about not making the invitations. Maybe tty to compromise, like a smaller ceremony with just you two, parents and vitnesses and a bigger dinner with everyone. My uncle and his second wife did this, they had a separate occasion actually for the party part as the bride's family couldn't make it due to living in another country, and it was actually great.", "YTA. It's his wedding too and his family he's close to. Plus his family is willing to pay.

I was in the same situation, I have a small family while my wife has a very large one (maybe not as large as your SO) with a ton of friends in our area.

It was great that we had all of OUR friends and family in attendance and it made for a great party.", "YTA - you are literally demanding that you get everyone special to you and he gets what\u20261/3?  \n\nIm usually a supporter of having the wedding you want, but this is just the wedding YOU want, not what your FI wants.

He will still have double the family I do if he does manage to narrow it down.\n\nSo? They're his family. He didn't choose them but they are important to him. This isn't a popularity contest or an accounting exercise, but that's a very selfish reason to exclude them.\n\n> I also suggested doing a seperate party at his dad's house in his hometown before or after the wedding where he could invite any of the family he wants, and they wouldn't have to travel far.\n\nWhy should he have to offer a consolation prize when he wants them at the main event?\n\n> However, my fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm being an asshole because I don't want 70+ of his rowdy family members at * **my** * wedding.

Calling it **my** wedding really shows your true colours. A wedding joins two families. If you're not prepared to do that, are you actually compatible?

You won't be put out financially.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nHe comes from a large family AND he is close to all of them. He should be able to invite his family.

This is a celebration for your fiance, too. If the planning gets exhausting for so many people, definitely ask him to help since he is the one that wants this bigger wedding.

Because it sounds like you see the wedding as your event and he's just conveniently invited.\n\nETA: Correction. You refer to it as \"our wedding\" in your response to the judgement bot, but that's literally the only place. The actual main post, you still act like it's your wedding only.", "YTA, it really sounds like you just don\u2019t like that he\u2019s inviting more people than you.

His family put pressure on me to only invite some of my family because they worried about the imbalance of representation. When I talked to my (now) husband about it, he said he would never dream of asking me not to invite the most important people to me on one of the most important days of our lives. He knew it would make me feel like something was missing from our day. You said he doesn\u2019t really care about wedding planning. So I\u2019m going to guess you have got to plan a lot of the wedding your way. If this is one of his few requests I would give it to him. After all it\u2019s not just your wedding. Also, if extra people ruin your vision for your wedding.. you have a VERY specific vision..", "YTA.\nHaving your family and his family attend your wedding in equal numbers is not a thing.

So they're considering themselves as your family already, but you can't seem to see them as your family. The wedding would be an opportunity to celebrate the family (values and members) you're joining and show them you know what it means to be a part of this family.

If you don't want your small family to be greatly outnumbered don't date someone with an immediate family size of 100 people. Also, how exactly do you expect to be accepted by his very close family that gets together all the time if your only reason why his aunt wasn't invited is \"I told him only x number of his relatives could be invited\"?

And ask him to get more involved with the planning so the two of you can decide together what is important and what you can save money on.

There aren't any financial issues here, because your future FIL is willing to pay for the increased cost. As a \"compromise\", you suggest that your fianc\u00e9 have a B-list party for his family instead of inviting them to the wedding.

The rest was my husbands family and our friends.", "YTA.", "YTA. I get that it must be stressful to plan for a bigger wedding, but what you should be asking from your fianc\u00e9 is his help with planning, not a cut on the guest list.

They are obviously close so why would he not invite them to the wedding? It shouldn\u2019t matter that his family is bigger than yours that\u2019s just the way it is. He\u2019s not just inviting them for the sake of it. If I was you I would also get used to the idea that going forward any family events you have are going to involve a huge amount of people.

You chose a man with a big family, a close family. What\u2019s more important, the wedding or the marriage?", "YTA. This wedding is about BOTH YOU AND YOUR FIANCE. The merging of two families. It's not all about you.\n\nMy BIL's family photo was less than 20 people. My Sister's family was like a damn senior class photo. 120-something people.

The fact of the matter is he does have more family than you. It\u2019s not a competition. A wedding is supposed to be a celebration of the beginning of your lives together. It sounds like he\u2019s very close to his family regardless of how large it is, so why shouldn\u2019t he have them at an important event to celebrate with him? It sounds like you\u2019re pretty selfish and I hope your fianc\u00e9 is noticing this. YTA", "OP, you seem to be thinking that marriage somehow is just between the two of you. While yes, of course, it's just you two getting married, and yes you should have each other's back first over family in most situations, know right now that you are marrying his family just as much as him.\n\nIf you exclude his close family now.... what kind of start to marriage is this? You understand that he is very close with them, right? That he's probably not going to pick you over them? You have to fit in with the family, or your marriage likely won't work. \n\nAgain don't get me wrong, if he's putting them over you every single day and your needs never get met, different story, but don't expect that he will suddenly not be close with his family once you're married, that's not how it works.", "Yta, do want to have a wedding, or do you want to be married to another human?", "YTA. This isn\u2019t just your wedding. It\u2019s his wedding, too. His family isn\u2019t \u201coutweighing\u201d yours. It isn\u2019t a competition. He just has more relatives than you.", "YTA. You are marrying into a large family. All events will be like this. If it bothers you call off the wedding. It\u2019s not just your wedding. Your fil has offered to cover the cost. The grooms family is the grooms family and if they outweigh your family that\u2019s just too bad. Get over it.", "YTA it\u2019s not just your day and dream wedding.

This is the man you are going to build a life with - you really want to get off on the wrong foot and alienate him and his family?

You deamed.of a 60 person wedding....  but then you decided to marry a man with a different dream.  He wants his siblings, parents, and grandparents at his wedding.

A large close knit family. Sorry, you don\u2019t get the luxury of excluding part of what he considers immediate family just because their are more on his side than yours.

If your fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t helping plan the wedding at all, it\u2019s even more frustrating. My advice would be to have a destination wedding, on a weekday. That will naturally cut your guest-list down, without offending anyone. \n\nInfo: who\u2019s paying for the wedding?", "NAH. I don\u2019t really think either of you are wrong for your wants. I think you need to have a realistic conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about what your budget is. A lot of venues will give you a cost per person if you\u2019re doing dinner/drinks. That will give you a better idea of actually how big of a wedding you can afford. I understand the wedding celebration is for family, but unfortunately when you take someone\u2019s money, you are opening yourself to a wedding that includes what they want - which may be the reason why OP doesn\u2019t want to take FIL up on his offer of $$$. Weddings are tricky. I had the same issue with my family and we decided on a very small wedding with immediate family only and no friends or family.

If not, he can trim the list.", "I think slight NTA. It\u2019s not just your wedding. But he needs to help you plan the wedding if he wants his huge family there. He isn\u2019t allowed to be uninterested in wedding planning if he wants every single family member there. It\u2019s not fair to leave all the planning to OP.

Don't start with your compromise (double your family) start the conversation again with equal guests on both sides then meet in the middle from there.\n\nFind the total cost needed for guests (venue, drinks, entrees, cake etc...) and divide it by the number attending.

For the most part he is not all that interested in wedding planning. However, there is one major part of our wedding that is causing lots of issues between us, and that is deciding how large of a wedding we should have. I've always imagined a medium sized wedding of maybe 60 guests. The idea of planning and paying for a wedding with 100+ sounds exhausting and wouldn't create the weeding I've always dreamed of.\n\n\rThe problem, however, is that my fianc\u00e9 has a very large family that are all fairly close. He has 6 full siblings, 3 older half-siblings, 4 younger half-siblings, 3 stepsiblings plus 2 former stepsiblings he's close to. He has 14 nieces/nephews and 6 great-nieces/nephews. His dad is one of 9 so he has lots of cousins (1st, 2nd, 3rd). He has 3 living grandparents (+4 step grandparents) and 3 living great-grandparents.\n\n\rThis isn't a family that only see each other at weddings, funerals and the occasional reunion, they are actually in each other\u2019s lives and have a close bond. The family he wants to invite is already way over 60 and that's before we even consider some of their spouses. \n\n\rMy family is a lot smaller. I have my parents plus my unmarried younger sister. My dad has one sister who is married with one daughter and my mom has a brother and a sister and they each have 2 children. I have one living grandparent and am not close with my more extended family so will not be inviting them to my wedding.\n\n\rMy fianc\u00e9 and I also have a large group of friends and our non-negotiable friend invites come to 27.\r  \nI've suggested to my fianc\u00e9 that he should pick 30-40 family members he wants in attendance so that his family isn't so heavily represented compared to mine. He will still have double the family I do if he does manage to narrow it down. I also suggested doing a seperate party at his dad's house in his hometown before or after the wedding where he could invite any of the family he wants, and they wouldn't have to travel far.\n\n\rHowever, my fianc\u00e9 thinks I'm being an asshole because I don't want 70+ of his rowdy family members at my wedding. One of my friends also agrees with him and thinks a larger wedding will be fun and that my fianc\u00e9 won't enjoy the day as much if he feels there's people missing. My future FIL has also been pressuring me about a larger wedding and has offered to pay to facilitate this. I don't think I'm being an asshole about this and neither do my parents, they agree that the groom\u2019s family shouldn't so heavily outweigh mine.

OP is petty and selfish and definitely TA.", "just curious though, why is it leaning to ESH?", "wouldnt that make it NAH?", "Depends what she means by wedding planning. He doesn't need to care about all the little details if he's focused on the bigger experience. But the literal first step in wedding planning is the guest list, so he could also not be interested in planning an event that they aren't ready to plan yet.", "OP FIL already offered to pay.\n\nBut curious how is it fair to one spouse to say, well I don't have that much family so you can't invite all of yours.", "Its THEIR wedding not just hers.", "This is dumb. He comes with a family and just because hers is smaller doesn't mean that he should have to exclude his when they are willing to pay. She doesn't respect who he is and who his family is. It is a good representation of how their marriage will go and unfortunately it's representing her badly", "How is that fair?  She has 15 people that she loves and wants in celebrate her special event.  He had 30 people that he equally loves and wants to be there to celebrate his special event.  \n\nThe starting point is now she gets ALL of her special people and he starts with HALF that?\n\nShe is literally getting her way in every aspect.  And her WAY is through excluding the people her future husband loves\u2026", "Is she marrying herself?", "Well said", "Yes. I think she may think she \u201ccan change him\u201d after they get married.", "Far better would be to allow children at the ceremony but make the reception child-free. The reception is when they be running around, getting hyper, getting into mischief, then getting tired and cranky. Plus less cost of food and drink for the kids. Let parents go drop off their kids between the ceremony and the reception, and if you want to be truly kind, make sure to send parents home with a slice of cake for each kid!", "Most people do the opposite. \n\nKids at the ceremony and kids go home when the food and booze comes out. \n\nBut I don\u2019t think kids is her issue but the sheer size of his family vs her aesthetic of 60 people at HER wedding", "Her wording is all about HER wedding and HER aesthetic. \n\nPretty sure she knew he had a large family", "This. We had about 55 people at our wedding. We invited 80 total but my side definitely outweighed my husband\u2019s he had like 15 to my 40. We\u2019ve been married for over 13 years and honestly that thought doesn\u2019t even cross our minds at all because it genuinely didn\u2019t matter. It didn\u2019t matter on our wedding day and it definitely doesn\u2019t matter now. We treated our guests as OUR guests and not mine and his. It would be one thing if these were distant family members he rarely ever sees or speaks to but co side ring the closeness of the family she\u2019s marrying into she\u2019s gonna have to suck it up and get used to being involved in a large , boisterous, and close knit family. If that\u2019s something she thinks she\u2019ll struggle with then she needs to call it off now.", "HAPPY WIFE HAPPY LIFE VIBES", "I know you're being sarcastic but if you check out some of the wedding subs this is exactly how most women feel. I feel awful for the men. \ud83d\ude14", "That's a milliwedding, a microwedding needs to have less than 6 guests. If you have no guests it's a picowedding.", "Cause if he\u2019s refusing to help her plan their wedding, he\u2019s an AH too.", "Yep, fixed.", "That's a lot of assumptions you're making in the fianc\u00e9's favour.", "If a lot of people are coming from out of town, maybe arrange an area at the reception venue that's a kids party, with some paid babysitters and some parents changing out. Feed the kids pizza or something.", "That\u2019s why I said ESH - OP sounds awful. But everyone here is saying that offering to pay makes it all hunky dory. I planned a big wedding for my huge family - it is a lot. If they want everyone to come, it needs to be all hands on deck, not just a large check.", "Oh, I'm very aware how some women are when it comes to wedding planning. I think they're ridiculous and I feel bad for the men who decided to marry them. These are the same types of women who get \"post-wedding blues\" because they're no longer brides and not the center of attention anymore.      \n\nIt kind of makes me sad for people who put SO much importance on one single day that they can't see the big picture of what that day actually means.", "That part. It\u2019s not fair to triple the size of the wedding and do zero work.", "The first step of planning is making your guest list so you can pick appropriate venues, caterers, accommodations, etc. They haven't agreed on the guest list and don't know their budget because they might get money from FIL or might not. What is he supposed to be planning when they can't actually do anything yet? Is he supposed to ooh and aah over different shades of pink or get excited about flowers? She sounds like she has a vision since it's *her* wedding so maybe it's hard to contribute to that. It sounds like they're just in two different places.", "she mentions hes just not interested in the wedding planning, but i could be misunderstanding what that means tbh. I mean if she asked him to be more involved and he didnt, then yeah hes also defo an AH.", "She's giving me very little to go on in her favour. What's he supposed to be planning when they don't know how many people will be there? They don't have a budget yet, they can't look at venues until they know numbers, they can't look at caterers until they know the venue, can't do invitations, don't know what to do for decor, etc etc etc.\n\nWhat's he supposed to be planning right now?", "It\u2019s her wedding, she emphasized that quite often. He may not feel comfortable because she clearly wants it her way and her way only.", "They could absolutely be doing research into all those things even without exact numbers. Not to mention dress code, decor, flowers, centrepieces, hotels for out-of-towners, other events surrounding the wedding itself, etc. If OP says her fianc\u00e9 hasn't shown much interest yet, I see no reason not to take her at her word.", "Oh dont get me wrong, I personally believe shes the AH, but I mean the fiancee is being an AH to himself if he doesnt stand his ground for his family to come to their(there? im horrible with these) wedding.", "Sounds like she has 15-20 people and they have less than 30 friends, so 50 plus who he invites. She said it's 60 plus spouses, so if half of them have partners it's 90 more people. That's a HUGE difference. The venues available to us for 60 people vs 150 were vastly different. Many couldn't accommodate that type of range.\n\nSo you pick your guest list so you can look at appropriate venues. You pick a hotel that's close to the venue. You pick decor and centrepieces that match the venue and fit your overall budget, which they haven't set because they haven't decided to accept FIL's contribution yet. The events surrounding the wedding are only for people invited to the wedding, so again there's no guest list (and some of them aren't planned by the couple anyway). \n\nSo he could be helping with the colour palette I guess? I'm not surprised he's not super interested at this point when it's all theoretical."]}
