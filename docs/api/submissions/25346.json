It\u2019s gotten to the point that she\u2019s using me as a cover up so my stepdad doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s buying her self clothes, she buys stuff then makes me take it up to my room and tells my stepdad she bought me clothes when she\u2019s just buying herself stuff. I\u2019m going back to school in a week and we just had a big argument because i need school supplies but she spent all her money on clothes, she also canceled my phone plan which i really need because she has to pick me up from school and I need to text her where I\u2019m at. She\u2019s mad because some of the clothes she bought was for me but I never asked her to buy me clothes. If I tell my stepdad she\u2019d probably hate me for the rest of my life but this has gotten insane and I can\u2019t deal with my stepdad hating me because he thinks I\u2019m spoiled.\n\n\nEdit: thanks for all the advice, I should add that my mom relies off my stepdad and she mainly works so she can support her spending habits.\nMe and my stepdad don\u2019t have a good relationship and we usually don\u2019t talk unless necessary. I do fear my parents divorcing because my mom doesn\u2019t have any family and if SD kicked us out we\u2019d have no where to go. My mom and stepdad already have a rough relationship.

Your mom is sick. Shopping addiction is a real thing. You did nothing wrong and it will not be your fault. She needs professional help.", "NTA. You are a child and she is an adult with a severe addiction using manipulation tactics. You could try giving her a set amount of time to confess to SD but I fear she might just cook up more lies. I believe another strategy might be to let SD know by A) showing him you have no new clothes or school supplies as listed by your school or teachers and B) asking him to check credit cards and/bank statements to see where recent purchases have been made. If they are not teen-centric stores or places where school supplies are sold then he might be likely to believe you. Either way, you should NOT be worried about making your mom mad you.

She will get mad, yes. But you need things for school and she keeps spending money that 1 could pay for other things and 2 she is wasting, because she probably has more clothes than she\u2019ll ever wear, if she\u2019s been doing this for years. You simply sit your stepdad down and tell him about the shopping. Tell him she makes you take her clothes upstairs, that she\u2019s using you and that you\u2019re worried about her. That way, he can\u2019t fault you for it, you\u2019re expressing concern. YWNBTA", "NTA, very uncool of her to do that. And yes, you should tell your stepdad, not only for your own image, but also because it could end up being a big financial issue that can't be resolved unless you get to the true root of the problem.", "I disagree about giving her an ultimatum. It gives her time to concoct a story that makes OP look like the bad guy. Addicts will say anything to avoid admitting that they have a problem. \n\nOP, NTA.", "My dad lives on the other side of the country, we have a good relationship but I don\u2019t live with him for a couple of complicated reasons.", "It might be time to involve him with what\u2019s going on with your mom.  He\u2019ll either give you the money you need for clothes and school supplies, or he\u2019ll deal with the shopping addiction himself.  That\u2019s my suggestion.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Keep yourself safe. Can you ask to move in with other family? Telling the truth may at least keep you out of trouble with SD. Or he may decide you are a liar. Either way, your mom is not your responsibility, your mom's marriage is not your responsibility, and it's probably headed for divorce no matter what you do, so be ready.", "OP, totally \ud83d\udcaf% NTA\nIt's totally unfair for your Mom to put you in this situation & overspend to the extent you aren't getting what you need.\n\nI see you can't live with your bio Dad but can you confide in him? Are there other family members you can trust?\n\nI'm not getting a clear idea of what  SD is like  here & you need to be safe & OK.", "You're NTA but you're in a very rough spot, kiddo.\n\nIf your mom and SD already have a rough relationship and she's spending out of control then this may lead to darker times when he finds out what she's been up to. You mom seems manipulative and it's terrible of her to drag you into her drama. She's 100% wrong for that. I'd advise that you say nothing for now for your own sake. It seems your mom might take things out on you if you say anything to mess up her marriage and your mutual living situation.\n\nI would suggest that you sneak a little and find out how to get a copy of your birth certificate and social security card if you live somewhere you have those things. I would advise you to look for some part time work to bring in some income of your own. If you can possibly say you're at extra curricular clubs and work, I would in your shoes. Save every penny you can. Birthdays, Christmas, work money, everything. Hide every penny you can. Get a bank account, if possible and make sure your statements are online. If you can, work really hard in school and get the best grades you can and also start deciding if you're going to be able to go college or need certifications/trade school. I'm saying all this because your mom's own actions are going to eventually cause your stepdad to divorce her or put her out of the house (by your post it seems the house is probably his before they married?) and I hope that you're as stable as you can be. The moment you turn 18, you need to lock down your credit so your mother can't destroy your credit score. Good luck.\n\nETA: I saw that your dad is in your life but you can't live with him at the present. Is there any other extended family on his side able to allow you to live with him? Continuing to stay with your mom is seemingly a bad idea.", "NTA. You need to tell your mom that either she can tell stepdad or you will. If she tells him it will go down infinitely better. If he finds out that you've been colluding to hide this secret, it will go infinitely worse for the both of you.", "please tell him. addiction is not just drugs or booze. she needs help, expeditiously. \n\nNTA", "This is great advice to follow if you have a safe place to stay if your mom and step-dad's relationship falls apart. If your mom is able to take care of you and your needs.\n\nBut what if you don't? You need to put your own interests first.  \n\nCan you take a piece of paper and write down all of your options (tell SD, say nothing, threaten mom, tell another trusted adult, steal your mother's credit cards and burn them....). Then write down the the possible outcomes with those different options. It might help you think things through.", "Yeah, don\u2019t warn her. You\u2019ll put yourself in danger. Gather evidence eg. Take photos of clothes she bought \u2019for you\u2019 in your mother\u2019s room. \n\nMake sure you have all your personal documents and bank details. Ask a trusted friend to help you check she hasn\u2019t opened bank accounts in your name. Then, aim at being independent as soon as you turn 18 and leave them to it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t have better parents but it\u2019s not something you have done. It\u2019s not your fault. \n\nGood luck", "I agree. Can you explain a bit more for OP how to breadcrumb?", "Definitely agree here!\n\nMom is an addict. The two of them apparently don't have the best relationship and the SD seems to be the one with the financial means and home they live in. I think the kid would be putting themselves in a precarious position with a mom like that if SD decides he's absolutely done with her BS.", "Ask him to mail you the school supports if possible", "NTA...but since they are now \"your clothes\"?  Sell for the money you need.", "It is unfortunate that you were put in this position, and that, at your age you need to be the adult in the room.  Sometimes there aren\u2019t really any good answers, and it\u2019s just \u201cleast worst\u201d solutions.  \nIf you have any honest, decent relatives (does anyone? \ud83d\ude09) you can talk to about this, who you know would maintain confidentiality until you\u2019ve made a decision, that might help.  Even a school counselor, but both those possibilities do entail some level of risk.\nYour mom will not be happy once she gets found out, which she will, one way or another.  It\u2019s important to remember, you did not create this problem.  You did nothing wrong here.  \nI\u2019m not a big fan of ultimatums, but this situation won\u2019t last, and it won\u2019t get better over time.  The best thing would be if you could impress upon your mother the awkward and uncomfortable position she has put you in, but people with addictions, and she is one, are rarely objective, reasonable, or sympathetic to such revelations.\nIn any case, YNTA, clearly.", "NTA - you need to refuse to hide the stuff, but you also need to do what you can to stay safe.", "Shopping addictions can happen because the person is incredibly unhappy. They are addicted to the feel good emotion of successfully purchasing something that a salesperson makes them feel good about buying. They also have a dream life in their head and they feel that buying the purchases will get them closer to that dream life. For example, if your mum envisages a more romantic relationship with your stepdad, she might purchase party dresses so that she is ready for when he finally takes her out to dinner. She enjoys the shopping experience because she is living out the fantasy of preparing for a romantic dinner that in actuality might never happen.\n\nIf your mum and SD have a great relationship, he will support her to make some life changes to address the underlying problems. If he is part of the problem (Ie reason for her unhappiness) and the problem cannot be fixed, yes they may split up. However, after the initial separation, your mum may feel a lot happier and less like she needs to shop. So hopefully some money will free up.", "You aren't getting basic needs met. She isn't acting like she loves you. If she gets mad at you tell her she should be mad at herself. You should tell. This can't go undescovered forever.", "I used to live with my grandma but she\u2019s a little insane and was abusive she\u2019s the only close family i have, the rest are addicts or dead. I keep my birth certificate with me because i fly out to see my dad, i also have my learners license and a bank account but I think the bank account is under hers (i don\u2019t really know how that works and if it\u2019s important) another issue is that I was trying to get a job but I need a phone number to apply and she canceled mine so I can\u2019t pay for it or get a job.", "Well let\u2019s just take a step back and think for a moment. Perhaps the mum is sick of dealing with step dad\u2019s BS but she feels trapped in a bad relationship? So she shops to make herself feel better.", "Are there friends you could stay with?", "Why don\u2019t you take a step forward and read the first sentence of OP\u2019s post instead? Mom has been an addict OP\u2019s entire life, so her shopping is not stepdads fault. Every time a woman does something shitty this sub bends over backwards to blame it on a man", "i just moved and I haven\u2019t started school yet so not really", "NTA that\u2019s so messed up. Why would a mother have you take the blame when you already have a rocky relationship with him. I understand your concerns, does she have a sister or a mom that\u2019s still living that you can confide in? Because they might be able to help you sit down and talk to your mom about her problem. You could try to talk to her alone but she might not take you seriously. If that doesn\u2019t work, you should tell him and maybe he can help her get help for it instead of fighting with her. Juste remember that you\u2019re a child in this situation and nothing you do will be the real cause of any break up.", "Tell your mom that if she doesn't get your phone turned back on you will tell. Also, he's going to find out eventually", "Excellent point", "Obviously the mom is shopping to fill some kind of void and that\u2019s sad for her but it\u2019s affecting her child. She\u2019s the adult. It\u2019s her responsibility to take care of her sh!t and show up for her kid", "In addition to letting your dad know, reach out to the school counsellor when you can. I think the more eyes on your situation, the better. Hopefully your dad has a way to help.", "Gather evidence: take photos of all the shopping bags in her room, voice memos of her telling you to take them if you can. Then tell your stepdad, tell him that she's buying herself all this stuff, you haven't been able to get school supplies etc\n\nAlso make sure you have all your important documents, bank cards, credit locked down etc because I have a sneaky suspicion she'll take cards out in your name to fund her spending habits.\n\nVerdict: NTA", "Before you tell your step dad you should have somewhere to land. If moving in with your dad is a possibility, or if perhaps you could talk to a trustee advisor or counselor at school who could give you some help in getting in contact with resources", "It\u2019s just important to make sure you have plans in place to make sure you are safe, that needs to be your number one priority, alright?"]}
