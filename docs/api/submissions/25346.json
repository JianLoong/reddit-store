It\u2019s gotten to the point that she\u2019s using me as a cover up so my stepdad doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s buying her self clothes, she buys stuff then makes me take it up to my room and tells my stepdad she bought me clothes when she\u2019s just buying herself stuff. I\u2019m going back to school in a week and we just had a big argument because i need school supplies but she spent all her money on clothes, she also canceled my phone plan which i really need because she has to pick me up from school and I need to text her where I\u2019m at. She\u2019s mad because some of the clothes she bought was for me but I never asked her to buy me clothes. If I tell my stepdad she\u2019d probably hate me for the rest of my life but this has gotten insane and I can\u2019t deal with my stepdad hating me because he thinks I\u2019m spoiled.\n\n\nEdit: thanks for all the advice, I should add that my mom relies off my stepdad and she mainly works so she can support her spending habits.\nMe and my stepdad don\u2019t have a good relationship and we usually don\u2019t talk unless necessary. I do fear my parents divorcing because my mom doesn\u2019t have any family and if SD kicked us out we\u2019d have no where to go. My mom and stepdad already have a rough relationship. Should I just ignore her and refuse to hide stuff for her?", "created_utc": 1692810543, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15z9yd8/wibta_for_telling_my_stepdad_about_my_moms/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mom is sick. Shopping addiction is a real thing. You did nothing wrong and it will not be your fault. She needs professional help.", "NTA. You are a child and she is an adult with a severe addiction using manipulation tactics. You could try giving her a set amount of time to confess to SD but I fear she might just cook up more lies. I believe another strategy might be to let SD know by A) showing him you have no new clothes or school supplies as listed by your school or teachers and B) asking him to check credit cards and/bank statements to see where recent purchases have been made. If they are not teen-centric stores or places where school supplies are sold then he might be likely to believe you. Either way, you should NOT be worried about making your mom mad you. She is an addict who needs help and who is currently manipulating people in her life (including you). Do not feel bad about trying make a grown up decision to help her.", "NTA, Just make sure you can trust your stepdad", "INFO\n\nIs your bio dad in the picture?", "....I wouldn't drop the dime right away and everyone encouraging this kid to do it immediately isn't thinking of the ramifications for OP. Ok, so stepdad gets told immediately and it's WWIII......what if they split, mom hates OPs guts for it and that's who he has to live with and depend on? \n\nThis is way over your head OP but I would do the things you can like stop covering for her, drop bread crumbs for stepdad to figure it out for himself and stay out of the line of fire as much as possible. Idk what kind of relationship you have with your stepdad, but see if you can't strengthen a bond there to get your needs met and help him mitigate your Mom's addiction. (do this by bread crumbing... )\n\nI know this sounds kind of shitty but OP is just a 15 year old kid and it's not their responsibility to take on a burden that will certainly throw their life into chaos.\n\nedit: YWBTA to yourself for getting involved in your parents financial matters...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you need things for school and she keeps spending money that 1 could pay for other things and 2 she is wasting, because she probably has more clothes than she\u2019ll ever wear, if she\u2019s been doing this for years. You simply sit your stepdad down and tell him about the shopping. Tell him she makes you take her clothes upstairs, that she\u2019s using you and that you\u2019re worried about her.
