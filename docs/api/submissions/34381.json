Not your wedding, not your place to get angry. You keep saying \u201cwe were angry\u201d \u201cwe were livid\u201d, did anyone tell you they were angry or did you assume they were, because no one else seemed very bothered.

Calling her behavior \"bitchy\" was completely uncalled for and extremely rude, I can see why your cousin prefers her company over yours.", "It was a dance at someone else\u2019s wedding 5 months ago\u2026 you sounds exhausting to be around.

Your cousin enjoyed her wedding; why put a dampener on that by bringing up her friend's behaviour?\n\nLook, the bride and groom had a blast at their wedding. That's the most important thing.\n\nIf the dancing ruined it for you, that sounds like a 'you' problem to me. Stop having a go at your cousin about this and get over it.", "Maybe, just maybe your cousin is laughing and not making this a big deal because she asked her to do it.maybe she didn't *want* to dance with her \"family\". Maybe she knew exactly what type of people you were and what you would do and asked her friend to do it. Maybe she just wanted to dance and enjoy her wedding without worrying about yall trying to \"share\" her moment\n\nShe's only saying she didn't think so, or whatever else she's saying to throw you off.", "ESH. The intrusive dancer for what she did, you for not letting it go\u2026what matters is your cousin enjoyed her wedding.   Don\u2019t keep trying to remind her someone threw a damper on it.   Don\u2019t keep telling her you feel no joy in the memory of her wedding.", "YTA That you let this \u201cruin\u201d your enjoyment of the event is silly enough, but that you keep bringing this up, months later, to try to hurt your cousin is quite bizarre. She enjoyed her wedding and her guest. Let. It. Go.! Your cousin isn\u2019t in charge of your emotions and reactions, YOU are. You let this \u201cruin\u201d someone else\u2019s day -at that!, for you,  that\u2019s 100% on you! Stop moaning about it.\n\nAlso, how old are you?!?! I pray you\u2019re a teenager. I\u2019d be really worried about your mental health otherwise.", "Yta. Not your wedding.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
