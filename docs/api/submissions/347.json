While she was in town, she apparently went to the local bar where my friend (30FTM) was. \n\nNow it\u2019s important to note I used to work there so I basically know everyone there and my brother even works there currently. \n\nMy friend, I\u2019ll call them B, told my friend (19F, calling her E) that they had slept with my mother and didn\u2019t know it was her until like the day after. \n\nAfter E told me, I was obviously upset so I called my mother. She answered and I just started yelling at her. I can admit that was not one of my better moments\u2026 but you find out your mother slept with one of your friends and you\u2019d be pissed too. \n\nSo, while on the phone with my mother, she told me that I \u201ccant control what she does\u201d and \u201cI should get friends my own age.\u201d\n\nNote: i\u2019ve been friends with people 3+ years older than me since i was like 13 \ud83d\ude2d. \n\nAnother note: my mother is a lesbian and doesn\u2019t know about B transitioning and has stated before she doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with someone transitioning as it\u2019s too much for her to handle both their mental health and her own. She\u2019s not transphobic or homophobic I can tell you that. \n\nMy friend E has told me I am not the asshole, however since talking to my mother about what she did I have barely talked to my mother. I told her she could pursue a relationship with MY friend or talk to me, but I would not be talking to her if she pursues a relationship with my friend. Texts here and there for doctor appointments. I also haven\u2019t talked to my friend, B. AITA for this?\n\nEDIT: feedback said i am TA, but i\u2019d like to note my friend (B, 30) was bragging about it to the bartenders and the other staff. This person has a history of creating drama and making the attention go to them when it\u2019s not on them.\n\nEdit: i\u2019m 16 F\n\nedit for pronouns", "created_utc": 1667214988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi8pcg/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_who_slept_with_my/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How old even are you? Judging by the ages, it's not even possible for you to have a healthy relationship with a 30 year old.\n\nYou absolutely need to get friends your own age, and stop dictating what your mom does with people in her own age group. Your 30 year old \"friend\" is consenting and capable enough to make his own choices about his transition and how he presents to who was well. \n\nGet over yourself.", "YTA. Why do you think you should get a say in who your mom forms a relationship with? If she were going after people your age it would look a little weird, but dating people who are nearer to her own age is pretty normal.  It doesn't sound like she even knew that this person was your friend.\n\nAlso, why do you know your friends exact ages but don't have a clue how old your mom is?", "YTA\n\n1. Your mom can fuck who she wants\n2. Your friend can fuck who they want\n3. Having sex once with someone isn't a relationship,  so that whole point is moot\n4. Mind your own business", "YTA. How old are you? I agree with your mom that you need friends closer to your age than hers. If you're an adult you should understand that she can hook up with anyone she likes without clearing it with you. It doesn't seem like she's going after your friends, so why so much hate for her? The friend you mentioned is also roughly your mom's age so there's nothing inappropriate happening there. Nobody is excited to hear about their parents getting laid, but your mom and friend are adults and get to have sex. Even with each other.", "**Seriously YTA.**  Your mother is still your mother, your friend is still your friend.  They are both consenting adults.  Neither of them needs permission of you to sleep with each other, or to have a relationship with each other.", "Did your mom know that woman was your friend?\nKinda YTA but its soft because in the spur of the moment sure you get to be angry and annoyed but if neither of them knew who the other one was and they\u2019re both in the 30\u2019s then you truly cannot blame either of them. Your mom has a point where you dont get to demand who she chooses but you could sit her down and talk about why it would bother you if she pursued your friend or maybe meet halfway in an idea.", "YTA, they were both consenting adults, if this had been a friend your age I get it but your friend is 30 and perfectly capable of making their own decisions. \n\nThere is a strangely possessive quality to your post, is there a reason for that?

While I understand a teen wanting to be in adult friend groups, a 30 yo being close friends with a 16 yo is a red flag.\n\nOP, between the lines I am reading a really difficult living situation that seems normal to you.  I strongly urge you to focus on high school and people your own age for now. Drop the 30 yo friend, keep your mom.\n\nNAH", "YTA. Neither knew who the other was & sleeping with someone one time isn't always the start of a relationship.", "YTA.

B didn't even recognise the mother so I am not sure how they are supposed to know that the child thinks they should be off limits to each other?

That's not a relationship, that just sex! Which, if OP's friend hadn't kissed and told, OP would have never known about.
