They're perfectly nice to everyone to their faces, but no sense of morals. They're the kind of people that think that scamming and stealing is a legitimate way to get ahead in the world and an accomplishment. For an example one of my wife's uncles chose gaming over working during his marriage, and when his wife divorced him for cheating on her, he won alimony and half of her money, which totaled over 500k. After he got it, he bragged and everyone congratulated him on 'becoming financially stable'. Those kind of people. \n\nOf course, my wife loves her family, so we see them frequently. I'm trying to raise my kids to have some actual morals, so I try to counteract the \"lessons\" they're learning from that side whenever I see it. The big news at Thanksgiving, was that one of my wife's cousins, Tya, and her husband just became homeowners for the first time this year. \n\nShe and her husband are young, so there were questions, and the story was recounted. Well, her husband's grandma died. She'd left the house to her kids to split, but her lawyer father-in-law figured out a loophole to take the entire house for just his son, and had him jump on it before the rest of the family even had a chance to know about it. He wanted to help out his son, so he paid the entire cost to make it happen as a \"wedding gift\". And to be able to screw over his ex-wife and her siblings, no doubt. \n\nPer usual, everyone was congratulating them. I tried to have a side conversation with my kids to make sure they knew that they really stole the house, and that that wasn't right. It was overheard and started a whole thing about how it wasn't Tya's fault, and what did I expect her to do?\n\nI'm willing to give that it's a little bit of an exception because while it was actively being done, she didn't even know anything about it because she was in the psych ward, but she does now, and she's certainly reaping the benefits. If something you want to not be complicit in happens, you have to do **something** to go against it. You don't get to go \"it wasn't my fault and therefore I don't have any responsibility here\" while you waltz around your free house every day, still cuddling up to the person that stole it. \n\nEveryone accused me of bullying Tya when I 'know she's vulnerable' and being too hard on her for just trying to be a good wife and survive when I know she's had a hard time, and this is such a good break for her, so why can't I be happy for her? I wanted to keep peace, so I said that we see things differently, and I told my wife I was leaving and would pick her up when she was ready. \n\nAfter I left, Tya apparently had a panic attack and had to be calmed down, and now I'm enemy #1 and they all want an apology. I don't want to give one, because I'm not in the wrong.

But do so calmly, and give her a chance to explain her side without interruptions.  Once she has, ask her to allow you to explain yourself in a similar fashion.  Make sure to try and cite examples of situations you didn't agree with, and how you are worried this will affect the growing perceptions of your children.\n\nAlso, ask how she would feel if her family felt they could get ahead at your expense.  Because if they think conning family out of rightful inheritance is brilliant, then they probably wouldn't think twice about screwing you over for the sake of your spouse.\n\nIf she fails to see any of your points I'd make sure you have one hell of a lawyer you trust.\n\nAs to the cousins panic attack, not your problem.  She better get used to people outside the family thinking she and her husband are scummy, because they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think that it\u2019s wild that their whole family is making you out to be the bad one in all of this. I understand Tya has a lot going on and no one wants to make her feel worse. But what about her husbands siblings. What about them? They had what was theirs stolen right out from under them. Where is the consideration for them?", "NTA.\n\nYou are the company you keep though. Stop letting your kids be around those people. Kids learn from what they see and hear. Even with you providing countering advice, they're still learning by example that even though it's wrong, it can still get you ahead of the game if you cheat others.", "First off, give up the notion of being liked by everyone. Being a people pleaser to that extreme will make you crazy and uptight, will force you to become a social chameleon which is antithetical to the way you presented yourself. If you live ethically and morally, those character attributes alone will create division and will cause many to dislike you in our relativistic culture. It can be hard to make peace with this reality but remember: if you stand for nothing then you will fall for anything. As to whether you are the AH, I would say, in light of the crowd and your desire to be liked, you were surprisingly courageous. Good for you. Thievery and grift deserve being called out when it is exposed. However, you know what scoundrels these people are. Stay away, and keep your kids away from them on their turf.  If you have to see them, make it in small groups on your turf. There is truth in saying that you don\u2019t want to meet a lion in its den. Also continue to coach your kid. He needs to hear from you constantly.", "No. You're not supposed to be okay with it. My advice is to stop spending time with these morally vacuous people so that your children won't be exposed to them.", "NTA for the lesson to your kids, but what you did was foolishly indiscrete. Save those conversations for the car ride home or after the guests leave, next time.", "NTA I agree it wasn\u2019t wise to have the conversation in front of Tya; it\u2019d be upsetting for the kids if they witnessed her having a panic attack or were forced to choose sides in an argument. I hope that your wife agrees with you as far as morals since she is so close to her family. You need to make sure that you two are on the same page and not giving your kids mixed messages.", "NTA. It's important for your kids to know what's appropriate and what isn't. Why is your wife okay with the kids being around people like that? Does she not realize that kids learn from those around them. Her family sounds like a whole big bunch of AH's. Are you sure your wife doesn't share the same beliefs and \"morals\"?", "I am seriously grossed out. I can only imagine what this crew would say and whine about if they were scammed. NTA. \n\nI agree with the rest though that that conversation would be better for a different time. I don't envy you the situation. Hope your wife is on your side. I would also lock down credit for you both in case they decide to teach you a lesson. Odds are nothing will happen, but to play the victim when they cheat and steal is pretty low.", "NTA.\n\nYou have no obligation to support and enable evil people. You certainly don't have any reason to apologize to any for making certain your children understand the evil involved. And teaching your children lessons in morality is a very good thing.", "Nta how is your wife accepting of this? I would question her morals if she is okay with this. How old are your kids? I would limit the time they spend with that family.", "It's a little late for this now, but why did you marry into this family?", "NTA though I wouldn't have talked to the kids in listening distance to the family.\n\nI agree that they are not good influences on your kids, and I think a convo needs to happen between you and your wife about limiting exposure to them. \n\nIf that's not an option, then having regular in-depth conversations with your kids at home about appropriate behavior, morals, right and wrong, etc will help them develop a good head on their shoulders so when they are around the extended family you don't need to worry about correcting every mistake they make around your kids. And heck, maybe even your kids will end up calling out the behavior... how embarrassing would that be for the family lol", "There should be two questions asked here: \n\n1) Does your wife condone these behaviors?\n\n2) Is she ok with her kids growing up like this? \n\nIf the answer is yes to either, then it\u2019s up to OP to try to take away the children from this mess of a family. This is the kind of situation where ultimatums are appropriate. \n\nIf OP\u2019s wife says no to any of the questions, then it is much more simple. Let the wife hang out with her family with shitty morals while OP and kids stay away. \n\nOP is NTA\n\nEdited to correct word", "What you've described, I feel like they can very easily brainwash your wife so you should look out for yourself. I just want to know, what was your wife's reaction in both situations ( uncle's divorce and her cousins new house). \nNTA", "Nta.

I don't think you're wrong for trying to teach your kids that sometimes people do crappy things and right from wrong, but you are really obtuse for thinking that having that conversation IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE YOU ARE GOSSIPING ABOUT, is not the way to go. \n\nYou wanted to keep the peace, but you did the opposite of that and thus I'm calling YTA.", "ESH.  If you're saying that in front of her, you're not taking to your kids, you're talking to her.", "YTA.\n\nYour wife\u2019s family is comfortable with actions that you find immoral, unethical, and likely illegal. That\u2019s how they are and this is a known fact about them.\n\nYou are not comfortable with any of this and you want your kids to follow your example instead of their mother\u2019s family example. I agree with you on this part, completely. \n\nBut here\u2019s where you messed up. You had a \u201cside conversation\u201d with your kids at the party, where anyone could overhear you telling your kids how you feel about their mom\u2019s family. That\u2019s a recipe for\u2026well, exactly what happened. You were rude at a family gathering and talked shit about a family member, and you got called out for it. \n\nWhen you do things like this, you put your wife, whom you presumably love, right in the middle. You set the example for your kids that\u2019s it\u2019s okay to talk shit about people whose lives you disagree with. \n\nSave the \u201clessons\u201d for home. Quit talking about your wife\u2019s family. Quit putting your wife in the middle. Quit making your kids feel like half of their biological family is tainted and that they are tainted by extension.", "I\u2019m sorry you did what? \u2026 How old are your children? Have you not taught them yet that private conversations about judging other people should be private in their own home? Oh wait \u2026 you would have to have learned that lesson to be able to teach it. You\u2019re having an adult conversation with your kids. Literally dragging up your kids into an adult conversations & pointing a finger at their extended family members is not the way to do it. Teach values for your family in your own home.

You can't blame a person so mentally ill that they were recently hospitalized. \n\nYou admit she would have had to have been proactive to not get this house, since she wasn't even around when it all happened. You're expecting this anxious, mentally ill woman to divorce her husband and become homeless to prove her morality. You're not being reasonable.\n\nI understand this family has issues with morality, but you picked the wrong time and wrong person to take issue with.", "*I tried to have a side conversation with my kids to make sure they knew that they really stole the house, and that that wasn't right*\n\nYTA. You don't have a side conversation in front of everyone schooling your kids on what grifters their family is. The more appropriate response would be to teach your kids right from wrong, limit their exposure to the grifters and stop acting as if you have the moral high ground. Acting like TA to your kids is going to cause them to question whether what you say is correct.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
