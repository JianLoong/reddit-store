They're perfectly nice to everyone to their faces, but no sense of morals. They're the kind of people that think that scamming and stealing is a legitimate way to get ahead in the world and an accomplishment. For an example one of my wife's uncles chose gaming over working during his marriage, and when his wife divorced him for cheating on her, he won alimony and half of her money, which totaled over 500k. After he got it, he bragged and everyone congratulated him on 'becoming financially stable'. Those kind of people. \n\nOf course, my wife loves her family, so we see them frequently. I'm trying to raise my kids to have some actual morals, so I try to counteract the \"lessons\" they're learning from that side whenever I see it. The big news at Thanksgiving, was that one of my wife's cousins, Tya, and her husband just became homeowners for the first time this year. \n\nShe and her husband are young, so there were questions, and the story was recounted. Well, her husband's grandma died. She'd left the house to her kids to split, but her lawyer father-in-law figured out a loophole to take the entire house for just his son, and had him jump on it before the rest of the family even had a chance to know about it. He wanted to help out his son, so he paid the entire cost to make it happen as a \"wedding gift\". And to be able to screw over his ex-wife and her siblings, no doubt. \n\nPer usual, everyone was congratulating them. I tried to have a side conversation with my kids to make sure they knew that they really stole the house, and that that wasn't right. It was overheard and started a whole thing about how it wasn't Tya's fault, and what did I expect her to do?\n\nI'm willing to give that it's a little bit of an exception because while it was actively being done, she didn't even know anything about it because she was in the psych ward, but she does now, and she's certainly reaping the benefits. If something you want to not be complicit in happens, you have to do **something** to go against it. You don't get to go \"it wasn't my fault and therefore I don't have any responsibility here\" while you waltz around your free house every day, still cuddling up to the person that stole it. \n\nEveryone accused me of bullying Tya when I 'know she's vulnerable' and being too hard on her for just trying to be a good wife and survive when I know she's had a hard time, and this is such a good break for her, so why can't I be happy for her? I wanted to keep peace, so I said that we see things differently, and I told my wife I was leaving and would pick her up when she was ready. \n\nAfter I left, Tya apparently had a panic attack and had to be calmed down, and now I'm enemy #1 and they all want an apology. I don't want to give one, because I'm not in the wrong.

But do so calmly, and give her a chance to explain her side without interruptions.  Once she has, ask her to allow you to explain yourself in a similar fashion.  Make sure to try and cite examples of situations you didn't agree with, and how you are worried this will affect the growing perceptions of your children.\n\nAlso, ask how she would feel if her family felt they could get ahead at your expense.  Because if they think conning family out of rightful inheritance is brilliant, then they probably wouldn't think twice about screwing you over for the sake of your spouse.\n\nIf she fails to see any of your points I'd make sure you have one hell of a lawyer you trust.\n\nAs to the cousins panic attack, not your problem.  She better get used to people outside the family thinking she and her husband are scummy, because they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I think that it\u2019s wild that their whole family is making you out to be the bad one in all of this. I understand Tya has a lot going on and no one wants to make her feel worse. But what about her husbands siblings. What about them? They had what was theirs stolen right out from under them. Where is the consideration for them?", "NTA.\n\nYou are the company you keep though.

Being a people pleaser to that extreme will make you crazy and uptight, will force you to become a social chameleon which is antithetical to the way you presented yourself.

It can be hard to make peace with this reality but remember: if you stand for nothing then you will fall for anything. As to whether you are the AH, I would say, in light of the crowd and your desire to be liked, you were surprisingly courageous. Good for you. Thievery and grift deserve being called out when it is exposed. However, you know what scoundrels these people are. Stay away, and keep your kids away from them on their turf.

It's important for your kids to know what's appropriate and what isn't. Why is your wife okay with the kids being around people like that? Does she not realize that kids learn from those around them.

I don't envy you the situation. Hope your wife is on your side. I would also lock down credit for you both in case they decide to teach you a lesson. Odds are nothing will happen, but to play the victim when they cheat and steal is pretty low.", "NTA.\n\nYou have no obligation to support and enable evil people. You certainly don't have any reason to apologize to any for making certain your children understand the evil involved.

You don't have a side conversation in front of everyone schooling your kids on what grifters their family is.

This is the first year they haven't been at the kids table, so normally they're in another room and too distracted.", "I think to show that the whole family doesn't have the same morals as OP.", "Excellent points about the lawyers and wills.  Scary thing is some couples don't even put together a will until they get \"old enough\".  Can't ever be too sure or safe when it comes to your kids inheritance.", "Kids are super perceptive and very impressionable. I 100% would not go near or bring my kids near these kind of people, be they my family or my spouse\u2019s. Have a calm discussion about it, but make clear to your wife they do not see the kids ever.", "While I am 99.8% sure that based on the viewpoint provided to us that Tya's \"panic attack\" was to deflect people's attention away from any possible critical thinking, I just want to add that I've had a panic attack over feeding my yowling and howling animals. Panic is a sneaky piece of work and everyone is set off by different things.", "While I agree with you on most of this, including that her panic attack could be faked, people can absolutely suffer a panic attack over something like this. People have all manner of triggers, so let's not say it's 100% faked.\n\nStill reprehensible people, either way.", "While the dramatics are undesirable it important for kids to see the fallout of immorality. If that woman actually had a panic attack it\u2019s because her conscience finally kicked in. \n\npersonally I think she\u2019s faking to get people on her side.", "Agreed, discretion is the better part not shoving a foot in your mouth.  LoL.", "Given that they congratulated the bil for screwing over his aunts uncles and cousins I would say they would definitely be willing to screw over OPs wife especially now since she is the black sheep for marrying OP, he might have just branded her and their kids as expendable to the rest of the family. He  needs to go to a lawyer yesterday and get their wills and trusts locked down for the kids ASAP.", "Fair.", "Sounds like the measure by which he decides if he can screw someone over is \"how likely this person is to cut me off forever vs. They're in this relationship too deep to pull out so they'll likely forgive me.\"", "I hope she's the exception that proves the rule for his sake.", "Everyone has such a weird take when it\u2019s family. Like. No. Fuck that. If they\u2019re scummy, I don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re related or not, you don\u2019t spend time with them! And certainly don\u2019t bring your impressionable children around them.", "OP, be honest with yourself, do you truly believe your wife shared your morals? Because it sounds like she makes a lot of excuses for her family and/or just takes the easy way out. Doing the right thing is sometimes hard and it sometimes means you end up either less than you would have if you had done the wrong thing. Does your wife EVER do the hard stuff and is she really teaching your sons to be upstanding citizens, or does she leave that all up to you?\n\nETA: Who do you have designated as a guardian for your children in the event of your deaths? How ironclad is your will? If you don\u2019t currently have a trust set up with your kids as beneficiaries TRUSTED person named to oversee the distribution of it, you may want to get that done. Imagine what would happen to your kids and any money you left them if someone like Tya and her husband ended up with custody after your death.", "Ok so think about this, you said in some situations you have to actually do something to go against things. Then think about your wife's reaction to these situations. Now think about if there were ever problems between the two of you. She won't even speak up now to say these things are inappropriate, she's passively supporting and condoning it.", "So either she says nothing bc she approves or she lets them think she approves by staying silent cuz she doesn't want to stand up to them.\n\nThose are both major red flags", "And pissing in the faces of your hosts is just as immoral as they\u2019ve accused them of being.", "I honestly didn't see what the issue was there. Two people who I assume she loved and who loved her, her grandson and his wife, are living in her house. I think a lot of people out there would probably want similar outcomes for their families and properties.", "Sure, but he is singling Tya and her situation out. Why isn't he preaching on the morals of being kind to those hospitalized for mental illness rather than gossiping about a situation she wasn't even involved in?", "As someone who before the age of 35, has lost both parent and was screwed out of any and all inheritance/residue, I can\u2019t agree with you enough. I would also add more needs to be done to protect/prosecute elder abuse issues but getting wills written is cheap peace of mind.", "Yes 100% this. \n\nOP can have all the conversations he wants, but that won't undo the damage these people are doing. The kids see adults they trust doing bad things and getting rewarded and congratulated about it. That is being normalized to them. They will remember that more than any side conversation OP tries to squeeze in. He should have had this confrontation years ago, before the kids were in the picture.\n\nWhat's up with his wife that she seemingly approves and wants to spend so much time around them? I'd seriously be side eyeing anyone who enjoyed spending time around ppl who think it's acceptable to behave this way, cuz I'd be wondering what they are doing/willing to do that I didn't know about", "Yes and stop bringing your kids around people who brag about committing unethical/illegal activities and congratulate others for it. You can't counter that with a side conversation", "I would argue OP started a necessary and overdue conversation.  Would it have been better to start it at an event OP was hosting?", "Being rude is no where on the same level as trying to swindle someone out of a house", "I tried to raise my children in the same manner as OP. They are adults now, seems that some of our parenting style produced  positive results (in the sense that I haven't found them to be schemers trying to scam people).", "What do you want her to do?", "She literally isn't responsible, though. And it sounds like this may be one of the few \"gifts\" the universe *has* given her. Doesn't seem like she's \"sitting back and enjoying\" anything in life at all. She's really not the person you should be begrudging toward.", "Not defending OP's wife, but she has been conditioned over her life to think this behaviour is normal and ok. OP might be the first person who has ever challenged her family's morals, values and way of thinking. \n\nNTA.\n\nOP, this is a turning point for your family. However you navigate going forward can impact your marriage and how your children interpret how adults behave. Time for some honest, courageous conversations with your wife and kiddos.", "Exactly. OP's life can easily work without them and they're just extended family. Just wish them on holidays and ignore them. But I feel like his wife is more attached to these relatives, that's why he's tolerating them.", "He didn\u2019t start it, though. He was calling his in-laws crooks TO HIS CHILDREN, basically using them as pawns to teach a lesson. \n\nRighteousness eliminates whatever moral high ground the OP thought they had.", "That couple need to get a valuation done, of the property, and get a payment agreement in place, at the very least.", "I don't know if he was overhead or \"overheard\", but regardless they should have been called out on it.  Someone has to take a stand against immoral actions.  In some cases shaming is the only potential consequence that would be understood. There's no \"right\" time for that.  If it comes up at Thanksgiving, then that's were that conversation is had.", "Again, what should Tya, the mentally fragile person who had nothing to do with this in the first place, do? You really think she has control of what happens with that house? Do you really think her name is even on the deed?", "I put manners over calling people out on their bullshit. \n\nSo, I respectively disagree.", "She should just enjoy the fruits of her husbands thievery, poor thing.", "Fair enough, but manners never changed the world.", "I just don't see what she should do or why op is picking on her instead of the guy who is responsible. But I suspect it's because OP is an AH", "Neither did pissing off your in-laws."]}
