So we didn\u2019t meet til I was much older. I don\u2019t have the best relationship with them and don\u2019t talk to them much or really at all.

You sent a gift, so Tiffany should know it's not that you don't care about her at all. In your shoes I would tell her the truth: you didn't want to go because you didn't want to ruin her wedding by upsetting her mom & other siblings with your presence. Throw them under the bus by sending Tiffany screenshots of every abusive thing they've said to you. \"I figured this sort of thing would happen if I went or if I didn't, & although I'm sorry if you feel like I let you down, I care about you enough that I didn't want to disrupt one of the most important days of your life.\"", "NTA, but honesty might be the best path here.  Tell Tiffany how you feel about your other siblings and the way they treat you.  If Tiffany was willing to reach out, she might be willing to help change the dynamic if that is something you want.", "NTA, Greg, Sara and their mom is. I think it was really sweet of Tiffany to reach out and invite you, but I understand why you weren\u2019t comfortable going. Explain to her why you did not feel comfortable going and suggest a more private way to get to know each other. Don\u2019t make it about yourself, frame it that you didn\u2019t want your presence to get in the way of her big day and apologize for having to reject her olive branch. Maybe suggest having her over for dinner or going out for a drink to connect.", "NTA\n\nYour step siblings and their mother blamed you, an innocent child, for the divorce of two adults. The blame lies with your father, your mother, and their mother. Not you. So why should you WANT to have a relationship with people you didn't even meet until you were 18 and blame you for something that is not your fault. Just because you share half the blood the same does not make you family. And now, as an adult, you are allowed to decide if you want to be apart of that family or not. It's your choice and there is not right or wrong answer. There is just your answer. \n\nIn all rights these people are total strangers to you. A stranger invited you to a wedding, where you know people who hate you will be, so you nicely refused and even had the unnecessary courtesy to send a gift. You did everything right.", "NTA obviously, but you deserve a round of applause for navigating this shit sandwich you were born into. YOU were a baby with no culpability and your half siblings and their mom are rank AHs for treating you like you're the problem.", "NTA. Sounds more like an attempted gift grab", "You are not an AH for not going, and they shouldn't have berrated you, but if you do like Tiffany, maybe try explaining to her why you feel uncomfortable, and that although you'd like to develop more of a relationship with her, for now, you are uncomfortable being around the rest of them.  She may be offended by that, but if she really wants to develop the relationship, she will understand.", "NTA, and their reaction proved exactly why you didn't need to go", "INFO Weren\u2019t your Dad and his family there? Wouldn\u2019t they have been supportive of you?", "NTA. You don't owe anyone an explanation as to why you didn't go. And no one should judge you for it. Also, I don't see how a wedding would be a good opportunity to get to know someone better....like maybe go for a coffee or dinner instead?", "NTA. You felt uncomfortable and I hardly feel like a wedding is a good spot to extend the olive branch. Why not a nice family sinner BEFORE the wedding. Maybe then you might have felt more comfortable. They probably would have been mad if you went too. Damned if you do, damned if you dont.", "NTA. It's an invitation, not a summons. You're allowed to not attend an event. They're just looking for a reason to talk bad about you.", "NTA. Tiffany may well have been extending an olive branch but it sounds like her family are just messy af. I completely understand why that would have been stressful. You made the right call. Send her screenshots of her family abusing you. Why would you wanna be stuck with these people?", "NTA but you should have given the actual reason. She tried to make peace and you could have said \u201chey that\u2019s awsome, congrats, I just t don\u2019t feel comfortable around your other siblings and mother \u201c honest is the best way to go here", "NTA. Tiffany and the rest of them, continue to reveal their nasty, hateful selves. Maybe they will move on and stop spamming you. And you have the option to just block them completely.", "NTA.", "NTA. I absolutely do not blame you for going. Have you told her half sister how the other siblings and their mother is treating you? It sounds like the one who invited you to the wedding May really want to try to get to know you and then maybe something good for you if it's what you want. She probably was poisoned by her mom for so many years as a child and is now coming into her own adulthood and realizing it's not your fault. But maybe she needs to know how the rest of her family is acting.", "NTA. You don't need this in your life.", "NAH, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this is the end of your relationship with your siblings. She reached out an olive branch in a formal setting to officially include you as family, and you shut her down. You very clearly showed you do not want to show up for these people, and going forward you maybe shouldn\u2019t expect them to show up for you. You showed them your priorities, don\u2019t be surprised they take your word for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Send those texts to tiffany and tell her:  I wont be there because your siblings and their mother don't care about me in fact they actively hate me and would at the very least treat me with passive aggressive attitudes and I just couldn't bear to go through that especially with those who are supposed to by my brother and sister. I did send a gift as I appreciated your invite but the rest of the family treats me so horribly, I just couldn't believe they wouldn't do the same at the wedding and I didn't want to be a part of something that would cause your wedding to be disrupted so I opted out. I hope you understand and know that I really am happy that you are getting married and wish you the best.", "NTA send Tiffany screenshots of the messages from her mum and siblings and say \"this is why\"", "NTA, greg sara and their mom are massive AHs", "NTA. You handled yourself very maturely. I'm sorry you have had to put up with this drama in your life.\n\nGreg, Sarah, and their mom proved that you were correct in your worries. Fuck them. They owe you a huge apology.\n\nTiffany seems like she may have genuinely wanted to have a relationship. That might still be a possibility.", "NTA.  The other siblings and their mom validated why your instinct was not right to go to the wedding.  Their behavior is so very, very odd.  They have little contact with you and all seem to obsess why you did not come to Tiffany's wedding.  Strange with a capital S.", "OMG NTA. What horrible people. I would go no contact. You don't need people in your life like that. I'm so sorry they blamed you, and that they feel like treating you like this in response is appropriate and acceptable behavior.", "NTA. You declined an invitation and were rewarded with abuse.

Was your mother involved with a married man?", "Yeah, OP, this 100%", "> You sent a gift, so Tiffany should know it's not that you don't care about her at all.\n\nOn the other hand, it can feel even mroe as a slap in the face. \"Here's the perfunctory thought, to let you know that I only care about you as much as it's good etiquette to.\"", "My Dad is currently battling a brain tumor. Tiffany's wedding was in her hometown, which is around a 9-hour drive from where my parents live. My dad can't miss his chemo and due to his chemo, he is very susceptible to getting sick easily because of that and covid (his ex-wife and my two older siblings are anti-vaxers) he made the choice to not attend the wedding for health reasons.

TF??", "I was looking for something like this\n\nWhat icks me the worst is (if this was the wording used) is that she says olive branch, not apology or something like that, like saying \"I was an ass but you were the reason my parents divorced so we are both at fault here so let's make up\", don't know if I'm reading too much into it.", "'only... as much as it's good etiquette to' is still more than not caring about someone at all, wouldn't you agree? If I thought the gift by itself was sufficient to explain OP's position, I wouldn't have suggested the rest of it.", "You could be right. Extending an olive branch means to make peace between two people. It very well could mean \"let's forgive each other for our wrong doings\". But OP did nothing wrong, is only being blamed for something."]}
