Assuming some flexibility in dates, you should be able to get both of them onto a plane to the USA for something fairly well under $1000. Did that bill involve moving a lot of household goods? She'll probably have to leave them in Germany.\n\nHowever, what the heck is going on? Is it possible to get your daughter a mental health assessment?

If you don't have the money there's not a lot you can do about that, and it sounds like your daughter *really* needs to learn about budgeting and contingency planning.

Was your granddaughter even there long enough to be enrolled in school?
