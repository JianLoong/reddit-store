I don\u2019t think anyone did anything grossly wrong, but I\u2019m not surprise this ended in hurt feelings. \n\nSo, OP, you introduced an element of transaction when you promised them a cash reward for their help. I don\u2019t know your financial situation or what your kids would have assumed that cash reward to be, or what they thought their involvement would need to be to earn that. Like if I knew it was a big reno job and I\u2019d get $10k-20k at the end, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be willing to give up a year\u2019s worth of precious weekends for that.\n\nBut if I found out after that the reward ended up being a whole house\u2026 well I think I\u2019d have too much shame to give anyone shit for it but I think that would be devastating. In this economy especially, being given a house is maybe the single most life changing, life improving thing that can happen short of winning a big lottery amount.\n\nOf course, they didn\u2019t earn a house. But then, neither did your daughter. It makes sense she got it, but a year\u2019s worth of weekend work isn\u2019t the same value as a house. So you gave your sons what they deserved (nothing) and gave her way more than she deserved - on balance, she was unfairly benefited, and I think it probably would have made more sense to sell her the house for a pittance or let her live in it rent free. But it also makes sense to reward hard work, and sometimes that reward can exceed the value of the work. \n\nIt\u2019s both fair and unfair, depending on how you look at it, and probably too nuanced for aita.", "YTA, 700k is a lot of money and I doubt you made it clear from the start that this was going to be divided amongst who helped you. I imagine your sons have a life as well which means rent, possible children, and other expenses. If I had all these responsibilities I would think twice about spending what little time I had helping on a renovation for \"\"some\"\" reward.\n\nIdk, again find it hard to believe anyone would really turn down such a massive amount of money if your intentions were clear from the start. Insinuation from my side would be that you set this up as some sort of test and weren't happy they didn't come to help you.  \n\n\nedit:  \nAlso, how could you possibly do enough work to earn 12x median income as a gift?", "You're only the ass hole if you never offer the same opportunity to your sons.\n\nEdit: just so I'm clear for those it's to hard to grasp I'm saying NTA because they offered it to all of the kids", "Even if NTA as a parent you always have to think about family unity.

It tends to be that the others are more selfish and put their lives first and don't feel any responsibility to show up for their parents. That's perfectly fair, they're entitled to make their own choices and prioritize themselves and their own plans or whatever sounds more fun or important to them.

It actually sounds like a great solution and perfect amounts. Daughter gets 1/4 for the help and then they split whatever is remaining as inheritance when the time comes. The sons effectively got written out of the will because they weren\u2019t available to help with the house. The daughter should definitely be rewarded for what she did, but this is too extreme of an inequality between the siblings for what would have been an inheritance.\n\nThe 3 kids were also going through different things in life at the time- one was married, one single and therefore likely also busy with trying to find a partner, and the daughter who had just gone through a divorce and looking for something to take her mind off of it. The daughter was in a position in life that was better suited to taking on this project. How much blame the sons deserve for not helping over the year really depends on how often they were asked for help, or if it turned more into a parent-daughter project quickly and they just assumed things were already taken care of and it would be difficult to sporadically jump in for brief periods.\n\nThe inheritance doesn\u2019t need to be soon for some children to feel it\u2019s unfair that a significant asset it given only to one.", "AAHH YES, how dare someone use money they made from the sale of their property on themselves and not just give it away to the sons who couldn't be bothered to show up once to help..", "Dude that house never was part of the inheritance, since it was OPs inheritance.

In any case it's certainly possible, but I'd consider them unreasonable there too.

Per OP their issue was: \n\n>That I am a jerk for giving her a 700k home and that they got nothing at all.\n\nso they wouldn't be able to say she was given a home, and it would be far more reasonable that what she received was tied to her contribution and both of them getting nothing was also tied to their contribution (or lack thereof).", ">  One did work and bonded with mom, two did not.

That's completely ridiculous. \n\n>Equal would be selling it and splitting 3 ways regardless of who helped, which would, in fact, be inequitable to the child who did help.\n\nI specifically avoided saying equal in my other comments because I don't believe in equal treatment unless the inputs are equal, and they rarely are.

I never said the sons should receive anything at all, you mentioning it here as if that was part of my argument is completely disingenuous and tells me you have to put words in other peoples' mouths in order to make your argument look better (i.e. you have a bad argument). Really the only resulting distribution of assets I mentioned was that the the daughter should get a lot ***relative to what she contributed***, and then the parent just keep the rest.
