I have seen her dad's collection of belt buckles from when he was young.  By the time I met him he was a school principal. I have never seen him on a horse in real life.  \n\nShe mentioned that he did all the events we were seeing in the movie.  Okay. That's kind of weird. I grew up around people who compete. They usually stick to their one or two events.  I don't know any bull riders who also do team roping for example.  I'm sure they exist I just personally don't know them.  \n\nI am not going to argue with her about her father. If she wants to say he competed in every event it's not worth arguing over.  \n\nUnfortunately I'm stupid. I said you mean he did everything except barrel racing right?  Nope he was awesome at that too.  I told her that barrel racing is not something men do at a rodeo.  It's a ladies event. She started getting upset with me for doubting that her father was the best male barrel racer she had ever seen.  \n\nI probably should have shut up.  I doubled down and showed her a few websites for professional rodeo.  She got really upset with me for taking the information on the internet as accurate when she knows what she saw.  I just finally agreed with her. \n\nShe ended up calling her dad to ask him about it. She put him on speakerphone.  He said that he completed in three events but barrel racing wasn't one of them since that was for ladies.  She said that she remembered him doing it.  He said him and his friends might have played around at it for fun but it was not an event for men.  \n\nShe kept insisting that she had seen him compete. He eventually told her to go look online. She said that I had already shown her.  Then he said if she was too dumb to know how to understand the internet had the information he should get a refund on her education. \n\nHe may not be a cowboy but he still kind of talks like one.  \n\nNow I'm in trouble for her conversation with her dad. She said that if I had just accepted what she said her dad would not have belittled her.  \n\nI did not make her call her dad and ask a dumb question.

Some people can just never be wrong and because your wife sounds like one of those people you are NTA. Does she frequently do this? The fact that even after you showed her proof that men do not compete in barrel racing and she continued to double down and insist she was right makes her TA! To then continue to argue with her dad about something he definitely would know whether or not he did and insist he was wrong and she was right means she continued to be TA. \n  I think dad might have been a tiny bit harsh for what he said to her but maybe she needed to be told since she kept arguing about something so ridiculous!\n   I'm just curious if this happens a lot with her. I have known people who tend to say something ridiculous that is obviously not true and who will continue to argue even when the proof they are wrong is right in front of them...it is extremely annoying and tiring to have to frequently deal with someone like this.", "NTA...this situation was blown out of proportion obviously but wife's inability to admit that she is wrong even when presented with facts is exhausting.", "NTA.
