Now she\u2019s not speaking to OP because he \u201cknew I thought that and that I was wrong and never said anything.\u201d    Better to hear that you\u2019re harboring a delusion in private than in public.", "> I am not going to argue with her about her father. If she wants to say he competed in every event it's not worth arguing over. \n\n> Unfortunately I'm stupid. I said you mean he did everything except barrel racing right?\n\nyeah this is the part. he seemingly decides he's not going to argue with her about her memories of her father, but then specifically asks a question designed to get her to say something verifiably incorrect. something that he can be the ultimate source because now it's not an issue of it being incredibly *unlikely* that her father competed at everything, now it's an issue of her father competing in an event he couldn't have possibly competed in. now it's a factual argument and you can prove her wrong\n\nwife is extremely defensive and unable to admit when she's wrong. dad is the one calling her names (though his annoyance that she wouldn't believe him is justifiable). but this whole thing could have been avoided but not making it about her (lack of) rodeo knowledge\n\nshe probably idolised that part of her dad but doesn't have any (or many) clear memories and has created false ones from a combination of real memories, stories, photos, movies. people can be incredibly defensive about false memories, especially if they don't understand the concept. the memory feels real so arguing with them or even showing evidence to the contrary can be an experience that feels similar to gaslighting. psychiatrists can successfully trigger patients to recall a memory that doesn't exist, and then when confronted that it was made up, people will not necessarily believe them and can struggle to identify a fake memory \n\nmaybe she just answered yes to barrel racing because the idea of her father not being amazing at everything hurt. but there's a good chance that asking that question *created* a false memory for her by prompting her to focus on this specific event\n\nshe still obviously handled the situation terribly but wow was this eminently avoidable", "Must be an area thing,  both of them were under 5'7\".
