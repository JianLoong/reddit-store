If that's not a modern cowgirl then idk what the fuck is.  OP was weirdly aggressive in wanting to prove her wrong and trivialize her memories, and he was wrong about some of it too.  He exhibited skepticism about her dad doing more than one event that men are known to do even when she said she remembered him doing both, and then tried to catch her in a lie by tricking her into saying she remembered him doing an event only for women.  But it sounds like she did have memories to base this on too, given that her dad admitted he probably messed around with it with his friends.  Yeah she was wrong about him competing in it but obviously she idolized her dad and it's not that crazy to me that she might conflate that memory if she watched her dad and his friends at the farm practicing barrel racing, then also watched him competing in the rodeo.  I'm imagining her feeling little and stupid when her husband called her dad just to make her feel little and stupid from the sounds of it, saying something like \"but I swear I remember that!\" and then being called little and stupid by her dad too.\n\nI feel bad for her.
