We've been sorta dating since then trying to figure out what exactly this is. We finally told our parents a few days ago who took it pretty well. \n\nMy Mom basically went \"I always knew you were gay\" and that kinda irritated me and I told her I wasn't gay and I'm only attracted to one guy.

For about two years, I was \"out\", but I still hated the lifestyle and wanted nothing to do with queer people.

Just like another commenter highlighted queer as an umbrella term for some and that was discussed.\n\nAs an individual I know myself and others have specifically used the term intentionally in specific spaces to describe things such as a while in a m/f relationship calling ourselves gay couples etc. While some people I know only clarify as bi/pan with people of differing genders or in romantic contexts since bi erasure can come from both inside the LGBTQ+ community and straight/cis/ het side. \n\nTo clarify:\n **Imo it's always best to try and use the most specific identifier available if known especially if you don't have a familiar relationship with someone.\n\n*For context a common convo trajectory where I live  to identify as straight or gay/not-straight --> get more specific or stick to umbrella term.

I think so often the intent isn\u2019t to downplay it, the message is often \u201cI have known a long time and loved you always\u201d not \u201coh honey we know, now do you want cheese on your burger\u201d", "It\u2019s definitely a read the moment kind of thing.  Depending on the person could go either way."]}
