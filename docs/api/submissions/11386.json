Just sit down with her and thank her for her acceptance and explain why you don't like being refered to as gay.  You have a parent that accepts you for who you are, which so very many don't.

Men aren't irrevocably tainted with \"the gay\" when they love one other man.  Bisexuality in various degrees (from equally loving everybody to having an exception) is a common thing.
