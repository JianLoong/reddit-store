I'd talk about how \"the person\" I was going to marry one day, instead of saying \"my future husband\". But despite those things I refused to say I was gay because of the bullying I experienced and the internalized homophobia that I was going through. In middle school, I hated gay people because I was always told that I was one and that people hated that I was gay. They tried to \"change\" me straight when I was oblivious to my own queerness. People pushed me out of the closet just to rile me up then shove me back in. From the time I was 6, people were telling me I'd grow up to be a \"lesbo\" and gave the lifestyle a horrible connotation. I was told by friends, family, and even my parents that I'd grow up to be a woman who likes women.\n\n It turns out... They were right. How I hated that they were right! I  was so angry! For about two years, I was \"out\", but I still hated the lifestyle and wanted nothing to do with queer people. I only got over it when I met my first girlfriend and I actually experienced how wonderful and comfortable it is to fall in love with someone without having to force myself.

You may think she's trying to do a good thing, but she is explicitly not listening to him. Surely we all agree that listening to your child and paying attention to any clues of what they might want from you in what to them is probably one of their most vulnerable moments ever is pretty important? Doubling down and telling them you know their sexuality better than they do isn't the most supportive thing she could have done.", "I've seen way too many guys that say they're 100% straight but just happen to enjoy sucking dick.", "Your last sentence kinda hits the nail on the head: half this entire discussion is about semantics.\n\nLike, if Mom had said \"Oh honey, I always knew you were bi!\" Or demisexual, or pansexual, or fucking whatever, would OP have been cool with it?\n\nI actually don't think so, he's clearly very confused and very stressed about what he's going through, and he snapped at the person who loves him unconditionally... probably \\*because\\* she loves him unconditionally.\n\nIsn't a thing where people sometimes treat their loved ones like garbage because they expect to get away with it?  \n\n\nNo matter what, he's an asshole for yelling at his mother in response to her basically telling them that she loved him and supported him no matter what.", "Mainstream reddit subs are subject to an absolutely absurd amount of made up nonsense.\n\nIt's not perfectly black and white, either; sometimes things are inspired by true events, sometimes they're purely made up, sometimes it's an old thing that people are simply reposting for internet points.\n\nThe number of pictures I see posted to subs like mildlyinfuriating, for example, as if they're new, when I first saw them online 15 years ago... is too damn high.", "Oh well I didn't see those ones. Just from the story I thought people were ignoring the fact that he could be bisexual but if he's saying he's straight then he probably has internalised homophobia", "To OP it\u2019s an incorrect label. He sounds bi or pan  and he should be able to determine this for himself. His mother, Reddit shouldn\u2019t be telling him what his sexuality is, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying", "Maybe what attracts him to his childhood friend is their deep relationship? Going by OP's post they grew up together and presumably know eachother very well.\nMaybe he's attracted to this feeling of familiarity, understanding eachother and feeling safe around his lifelong friend.\n\nHe's attracted to this person because they're a human he connects with and they happen to be a guy. I'd say he can totally not be sexually attracted to other men or men in general.", "That\u2019s the whole point of being bisexual is that your not gay. You\u2019re into both women and women, the terminology is completely different. Just because you think what you say is a fact doesn\u2019t mean it is, that\u2019s flat earth logic.", "That is so incorrect", "The thing is he is all up in the comments insisting he is straight, which is why people are commenting. He could be one of many things but what he absolutely isn\u2019t is straight.", "That last sentence\u2026lmao", "Can you explain why? Genuinely asking", "You can't identify as straight when you're attracted to two genders", "I agree that sexuality is a spectrum and bisexuality might not be what he's comfortable with. In his case it seems like internalized homophobia. He just needs time to figure his sexuality out (if he wants to). But it shouldn't be an insult to be called gay anyway.\n\nHe might be pan, he might be bi, he might even be abrosexual, but he's not straight.", "He literally said in a comment that he is not bi. You don\u2019t actually get to declare someone else\u2019s identity.", "Okay I reread it again. To me it sounds like she's trying her best to be supportive and wants to allow her son to be who he is.", "Okay fair point", "Exactly. In the absence of him expressing any particular identity (which I don\u2019t believe OP has done), her insistence that her son is gay comes off less as bisexual erasure and more as her (again, clumsy) way of calling out what she perceives to be internalized homophobia.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case then she is very much NTA, in fact I\u2019d say that is a very commendable and healthy intention for her to have. She may have some learning and growing to do, but so does OP!", "Maybe. OP\u2019s description could be read as her gloating that she knew and trying to force him into a label he isn\u2019t comfortable with. But OP\u2019s words could also be read as her trying to reassure him in case he was worried about being judged. \n\nIt\u2019s possible that she just meant exactly what she said and that it\u2019s okay to \u201cjust be gay.\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t know how old Op\u2019s mom is but she might not have a very nuanced understanding of sexuality and she may have been trying to make him feel comfortable. Or not. I don\u2019t know. But it does seem like people are projecting a lot into the situation that isn\u2019t attributable to actual words she said.", "If they didn't want people commenting on what their sexuality is, then they shouldn't have created an AITA post about it.", "It's not biphobia.", "I read it more as 'I love Jasper despite his gender' though I can def see how you are reading it too.", "Have you even seen the clip?", "We all know the dude wouldn\u2019t have accepted being bi either\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "The bi and pan erasure is real.", "Not if you only have sex with men. That\u2019s called using women as your beard.", "This is a valid perspective.\n\n I can't really speak for how people outside of the community use it and if it's offensive. In my experience and region it's pretty common and I haven't seen much disagreement from the community for it to be used in an umbrella term fashion but if someone disagreed I wouldn't argue the other way. There are several GSA (gay,straight alliance) clubs in schools, \u201cgay\u201d  programs etc, clubs etc utilizing it as an umbrella term in my area where it's understood people not in the community use it as an umbrella also describing those places, events etc.\n\nFor context I've worked & volunteered in community centers etc specifically caters to the LGBTQ+ in my area for a while.\n\n\n\n>Bi erasure is very prevalent and I can't imagine tons of bi folk are thrilled at once again being told they're in a box they don't belong to.\n\nBi erasure is real with historical intricacies and if someone was upset with it being used regarding them it is valid and would make sense. \n\nTbqh more specifically in my experience both bi and pan people have often also used it as an umbrella term too while also using more specific verbage in different scenarios. *But that's just my experience.* Language is dynamic and usage of different things varies based on a bunch of factors and the same term first means the same thing everywhere. Just like another commenter highlighted queer as an umbrella term for some and that was discussed.\n\nAs an individual I know myself and others have specifically used the term intentionally in specific spaces to describe things such as a while in a m/f relationship calling ourselves gay couples etc. While some people I know only clarify as bi/pan with people of differing genders or in romantic contexts since bi erasure can come from both inside the LGBTQ+ community and straight/cis/ het side. \n\nTo clarify:\n **Imo it's always best to try and use the most specific identifier available if known especially if you don't have a familiar relationship with someone.\n\n*For context a common convo trajectory where I live  to identify as straight or gay/not-straight --> get more specific or stick to umbrella term. Like pretty soon with meeting someone unless they start with the more specific identifier first. Like even many people on dating apps just say not straight etc and wait for convos to specify in my experience here*", "You're doing an awful lot of work attributing malice to what's clearly ignorance. The odds of mom being up-to-date and knowing what the fuck biphobia is are pretty slim. She thought her son was coming out as gay, and when he very clearly overreacted in some sort of internal denial, she tried to reassure him that he's okay to like boys if that's his prerogative. Did she do the best? Nah, she could've been a bit more tactful, but there was absolutely zero malice coming from her. You're an asshole for making her out to be some anti-bisexual supervillain.", "At the end of the day, based on what he's said in this post, we have no reason to assume he's *gay* specifically, and not bisexual. He clearly has same-sex attraction to his friend and is a bit obsessed with him -- but that doesn't suggest his attraction to women *must* be some self-delusion.", "He is, and he\u2019s going to hurt everyone he loves, but most of all, himself.", "yeah, i read a few comment threads. OP was not open to anything pan, demi, bi, gay, literally nothing. still just arguing that he's straight except for the one guy that he loves and had sex with, and that's normal anyways because ALL straight guys experiment duh /s", "He\u2019s not bi because he is only attracted to this one guy. According to him.", "It feels trivializing. Okay so they knew already.  But sharing was a big deal to the person who shared and now they are acting like it was no big deal, but it WAS.  It just feels deflating and not supportive like the person intended, in my personal experience", "He is attracted to one gender. The opposite gender. And *one* person who happens to be the same gender.", "I didn\u2019t call him bi either. I said that it\u2019s common for bi people to not want to be called gay. It\u2019s also common for anyone non-gay to not want to be called gay. \n\nAnd that he clarified that he is predominately attracted to women. He didn\u2019t say he was bi either. \n\nBut my point stands that regardless of his label, he disagreed and she doubled down with her logic that because he is attracted to one man he is gay. Which is not her call to make and is a form of homophobia and bi-erasure.", "Which is why OP was annoyed. Because that is what his mum was trying to do.", "Hopefully, that is her intention. But she doubled down, even well meaningfully, and turned the conversation into one where OP felt uncomfortable. \n\nIntentions do not negate impact and when he tried to clarify the first time she went harder and didn\u2019t actually listen. Then he got frustrated, rightfully so imo, that she was taking something he probably felt anxious about and making it about her and her acceptance of him.", "\"All it means is you care about the person and not what's between their pants.\"\n\nMaking bisexuals out to be shallow or focused on genitals, reinforcing the sexual deviant stereotype. So yes, biphobia", "I think he's deleted them now cause I looked at his account and there's only 3 comments there. Him and a lot of people in this comment section have a really binary view of sexualities tho. Ik a lot of the time it's just gay or bi but it's not always", "People can be asexual tho. He could be pan or something and just sexually attracted to women and people he's close too. There's a term for that but I can't think of it atm", "Yes that's two genders", "She was trying to be supportive and put her foot in her mouth. That warrants a conversation not screaming at her.", "idk if he deleted or if i misremembered reading more. either way it seems like the main issue comes down to he came out to his mom, she went 'ah, now i can mention it' and used the word gay to describe OP. OP seems to not be fully straight or gay, but took offense to being labeled as gay.\n\nenough people have explained that's not really what his mom was trying to say, and explained a bit about different sexualities, that i hope he can learn from this and accept himself a bit better.", "I mean I doubt he is asexual since he clearly states he is sexually attracted to his boyfriend and they do sexual things.  Sure there are all kinds of labels he can use, but insisting you are straight and actually getting mad at your mother for trying to emphasize with you is a reaction born out of not being fully truthful with himself and not doing the self reflection necessary to come to terms with the truth about yourself.  I mean he can go around telling everyone he is straight while he introduces them to his boyfriend, but people are gonna think he is delusional which it kinda seems like he is.", "Ok, you seem to not be getting the concept, so I\u2019m done arguing. Have a nice day.", "Yeah I do agree with the YTA judgement because OP really did overreact, I was just making the point that what the mother said was also wrong, albeit far less so and understandably so. As you say, she just put her foot in her mouth.", "Ya looking back he could've been nicer. Thinking about it more she's not really gonna know much about it is she. I still wouldn't call him an AH tho I do feel bad for him", "I get why he did tho. Coming out is stressful asf", "Idt he's actually said straight tho but he could've deleted comments. This isn't really an aita situation to post cause you'd really need to be there to get what ttone she was using", "Considering when he got mad she tried to assure him that it was Ok with her that he was gay, it only made him more mad, I don't think the tone was \"OMG I always knew your were a homo you little F@##it\" She was clearly trying to be supportive, and perhaps if OP had the capability describe his feelings and emotions beyond \"I am not anything LGBTQ and I am attracted to women, but I am attracted to this one guy more, and we are dating and basically in love\" There very likely was almost no reaction his mother could have had that didn't make him uncomfortable because he himself very much does not seem comfortable getting real with himself or the situation."]}
