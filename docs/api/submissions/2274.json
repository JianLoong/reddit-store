It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone who is actually straight keeping this up for two years. Hiding any relationships? Crushes? Not caring if people told others he\u2019s gay? That\u2019s a lot of commitment for some bad jokes. \nSo maybe he\u2019s just not sure about his orientation? Or trying to go back into the closet? Or developed something towards a female and hope this means being gay is behind him? Testing you how you\u2019d respond? \n\nSo I think it\u2019s not good to dump him.

Like really why would he lie/joke about that? Any possibility he was or still is unsure about his sexuality?", "NTA. that's a bizarre thing to lie about and the reasoning is messed up too. lying about being gay to say homophobic slurs? wtf is that about? not being in contact is a good idea", ">He's used it as an excuse for saying slurs aswell\n\nSo... you cut a lying bigot out of your life?
