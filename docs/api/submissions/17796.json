The brother can\u2019t walk talk or even feed himself, which would take up more time looking after him rather than my daughter. I also wanted to have more children but it would make it impossible caring for a newborn and him at the same time. I told my husband no and I will get a job and he can look after his brother and our daughter which he didn\u2019t want to do. The parents have given us no option since they want to travel, which is quite unfair on everyone just dropping their child to go overseas.

Tell him that you will not take on caring for his brother to make his parents lives easier. You should start consulting divorce lawyers.", "NTA. \n\nIt's absolutely ridiculous of your inlaws & partner to think this is in ANY way a reasonable expectation to place on you.\n\nIf your inlaws want to travel: they can hire a caregiver for your BIL.", "NTA - but be prepared for him to magically appear at your doorstep.  I'd start setting up exit strategies now if I were you.", "So so so. NTA!    You need to figure out a place you can go if it comes down to it.  I am afraid that your hubs will agree, and one day they just show up with brother and his stuff.   If this happens you need a quick exit where you just leave 1/2 an hour later.   The in laws are still pretty young and are just tired of doing the work because it is darn hard to care for him.  You may want to consider whether you still want to be a stay at home mom because it seems as if your hubs does not respect the effort and time it takes to care for a baby.", "OP seriously look at your setting up your escape plan and keep it open in the event your husband's brother magically appears one day at your house.  Your in-laws and husband aren't budging likely and it's quite possible wouldn't care if you were good with the arrangement or not.  Best of luck to you and worry about you and your daughter.", "**NTA**\n\nStart looking for programs and facilities in your area that can properly care for your BIL.    Check to see what kind of state programs can offer support", "NTA.", "NTA. In any way. Especially since your husband doesn't want to do it either. This is a huge ask, and your reasons for not wanting to take this on are entirely valid!\n\nI *totally* get where his parents are, wanting to finally have some time to live and travel before they're too old, but dumping him on you  isn't the answer.", "You are NTA and this *is* a hill to die on.", "NTA, keep saying no.  My great grandparents tried pulling the same thing with my grandmother and her siblings.  They kept refusing so my grandmother's sister was put into a home instead.  It ended up being the best thing for her because for the first time she had friends and got to do things.", "NTA but your in laws and your husband are YTA", "NTA.  Oh hell no! You have your own child to take care of.  His parents can't just decide to give you theirs. Your husband needs to prioritize the family he chose to create with you and tell his parents they need to find other options for the brother.", "NTA. It'd be one thing if they asked to look after him for a few days while they travel to give them a break, but full time is totally unfair to ask of you, and your husband knows it, because when you presented him with the reverse scenario where you get a job and he becomes a stay-at-home dad he has no interest in doing it. He has some nerve calling you an asshole when he refuses to do the very thing he's asking of you.", "NTA.  Not even a little bit. \n\nLove that your husband is happy to drop you into this shit....\n\nMaybe consider before having more kids if he sees you as a problem dumping ground. \n\nYes, a person that severely disabled IS a problem, and is not hers...", "You are NTA whatsoever.\n\nIt\u2019s telling that your husband wouldn\u2019t quit his job and do it and unreasonable and hypocritical that he expects you to.\n\nThis is terrible behaviour by your in laws. They are not entitled to dump their responsibilities on to you, let alone assume that you will do it without consultation. And that\u2019s the point: their son is their responsibility. I understand carer burnout but that doesn\u2019t mean they have any right to abandon him. They can also look at other alternatives. \n\nIt is also a much bigger job looking after someone like your brother in law than looking after a child. A child will hit developmental milestones and the level of care required will change, not to mention that other people can babysit a child. This is not as true of a severely disabled adult.\n\nWhatever you do, stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nHard one - hope you're OK.", "NTA, tell them to go through the state and find a CILA for him to live at. You can be his guardian and have him live in a group type home where there are 4 individuals living in a regular house with staff that helps them 24 hours a day", "Nope, not even slightest, caring for a disabled adult is a full time job, and having that compete with your babies needs is a recipe for neglect, that's an impossible burden. That is too much workload for one person.\n\nThey are all trying to manipulate and exploit you. It's telling your husband doesn't want to quit his job and do the labour himself, because he knows how hard it is but he is willing to guilt and bully you. \n\nPersonally I'd go get a job, even part time in anticipation of them dumping this adult on your doorstep. I would be prepared to leave my marriage over this. I would be prepared to up and go because they are pushing a caretaking burden on you and running off overseas, they've been eyeing you up for ages. The fact they've already got the plan they've talked about behind your back and you were never in the conversation says a lot about the kinds of people you're dealing with, they view you as a resource and not a person and a mother obligated to her child", "NTA. Do not do it. Refuse. Stay strong agai st this abuse.", " NTA - your in laws are extremely crass for trying to do this to you.  Your husband has 0 clue how hard this would be, I would be telling him if he sticks you with his brother, you are giving him divorce papers so he can pay alimony and child support and take care of his brother by himself.\n\nYou are young, saddling you down with a person that isn\u2019t even your own child will absolutely destroy this marriage.", "Wow this sucks.     \n\n\nYou're NTA.   It's incredibly unfair to expect someone with small children and possible plans to have more to take on the care of a disabled adult, especially when other people are available to do it.   It is not your or your husband's responsibility.  However, you husband can and might take on that responsibility (legally.  hubby and I work in disability advocacy.  Your husband could take legal guardianship of his brother, and then his care would be his (your husband's) legal responsibility).  At which point, you have to decide what you want to do.    \n\n\nIt sounds like your husband's family just assumes he, and therefore you, will take over care for your BIL.  This is something that should have been discussed before the two of you married, and again when your first child was born.  As it wasn't, you need to discuss it now.  Start with your husband.  Ask him what he thinks life looks like for his brother in ten, twenty, forty years.   Tell him you are not comfortable providing care.  Tell him what you would need to agree to guardianship--would you want your BIL in a separate dwelling, or would a room in your house be enough?  Would day staff to help care for him work for you, or would you want round the clock care so that you were responsible for none of it?  And then ask him about your own lives.  Does he see you having more children?  What if you have a disabled child, too?  How will that change your BIL's place in your lives?  \n\n\nOnce the two of you have agreed on what you want and are comfortable with, then it's time to sit down with the in-laws and talk to them.   You will need to present a united front, especially if they have spent the past couple of decades assuming that once your husband was settled, they could leave his brother with him and move on with their own lives.   \n\n\nHubby and I have both spent a lot of time in disability advocacy, and these conversations suck.  They just do.  But they are so important to keep the family strong and to make sure the disabled person is getting the care they need with the best quality of life available to them.", "NTA\n\n> My husband and his parents have the idea that since I stay at home that I can look after his brother too. \n\nHAhahahahahahahahahahaha\n\n#*no.*\n\n> The parents have given us no option since they want to travel\n\nLOL, too fucking bad! \n\nIt's *their* kid and if *they* want to abandon him for a jet-set life, **_they_** are going to have to be the ones to make the nasty decision themselves.", "NTA - But your in-laws are. They should not expect someone else to shoulder the burden of his care just because they are tired of it.", "Nta.  You spoke your truth, and caring for an disabled adult is a lot of work and not everyone can do it. Your husband should never had considered it without discussing it with you. His parents need to make other arrangements.", "NTA. Divorce. Put that on the table now. He cannot force you to be a caretaker for his disabled sibling. I'm telling you right now, if this is not something you're on board for and willing to do, not only you but your child and your marriage will suffer more than currently. \n\nReach out to your own support system. Get yourself and your kid out. Your husband is effectively destroying your relationship by dying on this hill. It's scary but its never too late to start over. You are too young to seal your fate like this.\n\nPlease if not for yourself, then your child.", "If someone dropped a child or individual on my doorstep without permission then CPS or the police would get called immediately.", "Finding a solution is not OP's responsibility.", "I wish I had an award to give this comment. OP came on Reddit and got some solid gold professional advice. \n\nIt's a really unfortunate situation because a person is being passed around like a hot potato, but someone who can't independently complete *any* ADLs is a huge responsibility. Not everyone can handle that, and that's okay. It's okay to say that it is too much. The disabled person should be somewhere where they can get the proper care and attention, be it with family or ultimately in a facility. \n\nIt's a little surprising that this is coming up now, when OP and hubby are just starting a family of their own, and isn't something that has been discussed prior. Surely as his caregivers, the parents have made some kind of provisions for where their son would go if they were suddenly unable to give him that care?", "Given the way she described her husband's behavior, she actually does need to have ammunition because he's not going to backdown without a counter proposal."]}
