They are not entitled to dump their responsibilities on to you, let alone assume that you will do it without consultation. And that\u2019s the point: their son is their responsibility. I understand carer burnout but that doesn\u2019t mean they have any right to abandon him. They can also look at other alternatives. \n\nIt is also a much bigger job looking after someone like your brother in law than looking after a child. A child will hit developmental milestones and the level of care required will change, not to mention that other people can babysit a child.

They want to abandon their kid but make you look bad for not letting them\n\nPersonally I'd go get a job, even part time in anticipation of them dumping this adult on your doorstep. I would be prepared to leave my marriage over this. I would be prepared to up and go because they are pushing a caretaking burden on you and running off overseas, they've been eyeing you up for ages.

It's incredibly unfair to expect someone with small children and possible plans to have more to take on the care of a disabled adult, especially when other people are available to do it.   It is not your or your husband's responsibility.  However, you husband can and might take on that responsibility (legally.  hubby and I work in disability advocacy.  Your husband could take legal guardianship of his brother, and then his care would be his (your husband's) legal responsibility).  At which point, you have to decide what you want to do.    \n\n\nIt sounds like your husband's family just assumes he, and therefore you, will take over care for your BIL.  This is something that should have been discussed before the two of you married, and again when your first child was born.  As it wasn't, you need to discuss it now.  Start with your husband.  Ask him what he thinks life looks like for his brother in ten, twenty, forty years.   Tell him you are not comfortable providing care.  Tell him what you would need to agree to guardianship--would you want your BIL in a separate dwelling, or would a room in your house be enough?  Would day staff to help care for him work for you, or would you want round the clock care so that you were responsible for none of it?  And then ask him about your own lives.  Does he see you having more children?  What if you have a disabled child, too?  How will that change your BIL's place in your lives?  \n\n\nOnce the two of you have agreed on what you want and are comfortable with, then it's time to sit down with the in-laws and talk to them.   You will need to present a united front, especially if they have spent the past couple of decades assuming that once your husband was settled, they could leave his brother with him and move on with their own lives.   \n\n\nHubby and I have both spent a lot of time in disability advocacy, and these conversations suck.  They just do.

I am worried that OPs husband volunteered his future wife long before he met her, though.", ">I hate that my brain works like this, but... wow... this never was brought up before you were um... married and had a baby?\n\nIt was probably brought up, just she wasn't there. I bet these AH parents and husband quietly all hatched up the plan of her taking over the care.", "100% this. And them all thinking that because she's a SAHM she has time to also take care of the disabled brother. Disrespect on top of disrespect. There are AH's in this story but the OP is not among them.", "Oh, she should call adult protective services for abandonment as she leaves and files for divorce. \n\nHe agreed, she didn't. So he would be on the hook for not being home with his brother.", "If her husband leaves the guy in her care, she can still call APS. she didn't sign up for it, so if yher husband isn't caring for him, he's abandoned just the same", "I worked for a paraplegic who liked when I did her morning range of motion exercises since I could physically do more than the much smaller aids she was used to, most barely weighing as much as she did which wasn't much. She said when I did them, she had less spasms throughout the day. I didn't realize that exercises could be that important for other disabilities.", "Absolutely. I ran group homes many years ago and the people who came to us late felt like much of their potential had been ignored. They lived the quiet life of their elderly parents and didn't have much possible enrichment when they were doing it. Also, a 50 year old guy who has Down syndrome and for the last 30 years has only left the house to go to church & the grocery store adapts really, really badly when his 80 year old mom dies. \n\nPeople want to tell themselves they're the only ones who can care for their kids, but caring for them is a vast amount of work & sometimes they don't do the work because life is like that and these kid's needs go on forever. Sometimes having a person who is paid to make sure things don't get overlooked is just better.", "This is exactly the problem-they have been the only ones to care for this man for the past 26 years and it seems as though they only want to rely on one person to fulfill all of his care needs. That\u2019s just not a very logical outlook on things. These parent should have taken that time to figure what services could be gotten for their disabled child from the state, (if in the US) and who around them can be solid care for their son. You don\u2019t just put something like this in someone without consulting them first. These parents didn\u2019t set up an effective support system and now they expect their daughter in law to do it. Our health isn\u2019t guaranteed. What if DIL\u2019s (OP) health isn\u2019t the best? What if she has an accident? What if she has a difficult pregnancy? OP\u2019s in-laws and hubby are looking at OP like she is only caregiver available.", "Unfortunately, if you're considering having kids, you've also got to consider the possibility that your kid could need lifelong care. If you're not up to that, probably best to not risk it.", "Plus she gave him a very reasonable alternative where she would go back to work, and he could look after him, and instead he called her an AH", "No, that was her husband's job. Why would she even think of that, especially at her age?", "This. Some people are very family oriented and know that they plan on caring for elderly parents or disabled siblings. Some people don\u2019t want the responsibility. Neither choice is a bad one, but it\u2019s 100% a conversation that needs to happen BEFORE marriage.", "She is offering to work full time so the husband can quit and be the stay at home dad and full time caregiver. Tell me how that is not reasonable?", "Not only that. Taking care fulltime for someone this disabled has a toll on your mental wellbeing and social life. I can understand it is hard for the parents let someone care for him they do not know, but that is no reason to burden OP with this. NTA", "Yes!! More people need to be aware.", "OP should definitely consider her husband's role in this. He is the biggest AH imo.", "I can't get it out of my head that securing her and ensuring her forced compliance has been the plan all along. Otherwise, WHY isn't he blindsided, too? Why isn't he going, but we have a young child, we're just starting our life together.  Why is he ganging up on her WITH them?", "How? I mean, millions of women do it, but it's a terrible option with a young baby. Who knows what skills  OP has. I get your advice but damn it's hard or neat impossible for some people, especially in this period of inflation and housing crisis.", "One of many reasons why agreeing to be a SAHM is such a risk. It requires so much trust that the relationship is going to work out, and in this case the trust was evidently misplaced.", "Absolutely \ud83d\udcaf", "Of course! So that HE wouldn't have to do it!", "Exactly this. I'm on the autism spectrum. I inherited it from my father, and one of my paternal half-sisters is high needs. She will never be independent and will always need a caregiver. I could potentially pass that on and end up with a high needs child myself, which I do not have the mental or emotional fortitude to handle. I'd be having meltdowns left and right from having to often disregard what I need to meet the needs of my child, and I might actually go over the self-unaliving cliff even if I do have assistance with them. Lucky for me, I also have tokophobia and don't like children in general, so throwing away my fallopian tubes was a no-brainer.\n\nEdit: \"tunes\"? TUBES! Phone, please...", "I've definitely considered it and I definitely will be getting genetic testing ASAP if I get pregnant. I have the most insane respect for parents who can care for disabled children, but I could not do it. One of my best friends growing up had a severely disabled brother and I saw how much it took out of the other kids in the family, the parents (ended in divorce) and the mom because she's the only parent that actually cared for him.", "We have that \"1 in more than ever any humans\" kid and it was missed in all tests (in case there are people here who believe these tests catch everything, they don't.  They are very narrow and some things just cannot be seen without a full genetic reconstruction, from multiple different cell types too in cases of genetic mosaics)\n\nWe have another family in a similar situation so decided to expand our family with our eyes wide open as to risks and the limits of tests.  We will be writing in our will our care wishes for her needs, leaving additional funds if we can for care needs, equipment needs, house modification needs etc and will also be ensuring that we will love any other children we have just as much if they do not wish to help care for their sibling because they will be siblings, not parents, writing their independence from their sister into our will also as current legal standards where we live will drop her legal guardian to them if she is considered an adult with no power of consent.\n\nOP when you have the discussion with your husband (and then the in-laws) please bring up who will be funding the house changes/move if you (theoretically) take on this role.  We can no longer transport our 4 year old up the stairs and will be forced out our house within the year by a need for a downstairs bedroom.  The bathroom is full of equipment, we have to store multiple wheelchairs, cupboards full of equipment and medical food and spares.  Your OH might be living on a gilded view of care, maybe the more exhausting and demeaning tasks always taken on by his parents.  Why doesn't he do a week, alone, on his own, at parent's house.  Call it a dry run as you will want a holiday at some point in your life!\n\nBasically significant NTA. The AH s are the in-laws who feel they should be able to up and leave one of their children on another because \"they want to\".  They are a parent, not doing a job.  Deciding to have a child means you sign on to all the parts of that, good, bad and ugly.  \n\nStick to your guns.  Your way or he can move into parents home, look after brother, and you and his daughter can have the house as divorce collateral as he won't need it as he will be moving as part of his new care role.\n\nEdit to PS:  we are exhausted. I am a full time carer, OH works.  When he comes home we split housework/care 50/50 except for sleep when I get up and wake OH if it is a \"whole bed change\" situation.  We currently have 6h a week care.  Grandparents give us every other weekend off respite which we use to catch up on two person jobs.  I am now diagnosed with carers fatigue and have been for over 6 months straight.  She had emergency surgery two weeks ago and her med needs have just doubled for probably forever overnight.  We never eat dinner before 9pm and fall into bed about an hour later to be up at 6 to start again.  Care is HARD and THANKLESS and UNFORGIVING. Nurses and carers and support staff such as the hospital cleaners and kitchens are the real MVP and I honestly take my hat off in thanks to you.  We do this because we love our daughter unconditionally. But care for a sick child cannot EVER go second need to yourself.", "Yeaaaa even if she sticks this one out i feel like hes made it clear this probably wont work out well into the future.\n\nNo reason he should be calling her an ah at all for this.\n\nBut im just speculating.", "It would be reasonable if she made significantly more than him and doesn't want more kids. \n\nIf she had such a high salary, this might already be the case. Husband would be a full time care taker after wife's maternity leave ends and this situation wouldn't exist. \n\nOP makes it sound like husband trapped her in a marriage and his family wants to unload their burden onto her without compensation because she is a sahm. \n\nHis family doesn't have much money otherwise they would offer to pay her or pay for a caretaker. \n\nThis OP is about the burden of caregiving and this family's inability to talk to each other and compromise. ESH \n\nWhat should OP's compromise be? Something like I can help take care of your brother when the kid is 2yrs old and after I've had some training on it, but only for a few days at a time when no one is available.", "Carer burnout is common but not talked about enough, IMHO.", "And her physical well-being. If he's that disabled, is she even strong enough to physically help him with the tasks that need to be done for him?", "Because he knows the long-term plan is that HE will be designed as his brother's carer when his parents are too old or die. He wants to be considered the main carer, such a good brother/son... while he doesn't lift a finger and it's his wife that does all the work.", "There should be no compromise because trapping her is exactly what they\u2019re trying to do. For all you know she does make the same as the husband. And then it makes sense for him to do it right?", "My 21 year old daughter has Down syndrome, and is beautiful and funny and no trouble. But she is with me all the time. So yes, I certainly have burnout because everyone else is too busy to help (I\u2019ve literally just put my foot down and got hubby to help me with medical appointments, sometimes). I can\u2019t even imagine others\u2019 burdens with severely disabled family members. I\u2019ve asked my girls to make sure she\u2019s okay. They adore her and would want to do that. But I did add that if that includes her living somewhere else, like a group home or something, they need to be on top of it. But I know she will be loved and cared for. I often struggle with the burden I\u2019ve placed upon them.", ">For all you know she does make the same as the husband\n\nShe literally does not, since she is currently unemployed. \n\n>trapping her is exactly what they\u2019re trying to do.\n\nThen they are definitely AHs and maybe are plotting against her. But they definitely didn't talk WITH her in that case. \n\nOr maybe OP is also an AH for not making it clear beforehand that she wouldn't take care of the brother ever, despite their expectations. And if it was their expectation, she shouldn't have married the husband. Shouldn't have had a kid with him. It takes two to be married with a child. \n\n>There should be no compromise\n\nThen they need to get a divorce. End of story. ESH.", "Great, we agree then. I support her fully in divorcing her husband. Good call."]}
