They are not entitled to dump their responsibilities on to you, let alone assume that you will do it without consultation. And that\u2019s the point: their son is their responsibility. I understand carer burnout but that doesn\u2019t mean they have any right to abandon him. They can also look at other alternatives. \n\nIt is also a much bigger job looking after someone like your brother in law than looking after a child. A child will hit developmental milestones and the level of care required will change, not to mention that other people can babysit a child. This is not as true of a severely disabled adult.\n\nWhatever you do, stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nHard one - hope you're OK.", "NTA, tell them to go through the state and find a CILA for him to live at.

They want to abandon their kid but make you look bad for not letting them\n\nPersonally I'd go get a job, even part time in anticipation of them dumping this adult on your doorstep. I would be prepared to leave my marriage over this. I would be prepared to up and go because they are pushing a caretaking burden on you and running off overseas, they've been eyeing you up for ages.

It's incredibly unfair to expect someone with small children and possible plans to have more to take on the care of a disabled adult, especially when other people are available to do it.   It is not your or your husband's responsibility.  However, you husband can and might take on that responsibility (legally.  hubby and I work in disability advocacy.  Your husband could take legal guardianship of his brother, and then his care would be his (your husband's) legal responsibility).  At which point, you have to decide what you want to do.    \n\n\nIt sounds like your husband's family just assumes he, and therefore you, will take over care for your BIL.  This is something that should have been discussed before the two of you married, and again when your first child was born.  As it wasn't, you need to discuss it now.  Start with your husband.  Ask him what he thinks life looks like for his brother in ten, twenty, forty years.   Tell him you are not comfortable providing care.  Tell him what you would need to agree to guardianship--would you want your BIL in a separate dwelling, or would a room in your house be enough?  Would day staff to help care for him work for you, or would you want round the clock care so that you were responsible for none of it?  And then ask him about your own lives.  Does he see you having more children?  What if you have a disabled child, too?  How will that change your BIL's place in your lives?  \n\n\nOnce the two of you have agreed on what you want and are comfortable with, then it's time to sit down with the in-laws and talk to them.   You will need to present a united front, especially if they have spent the past couple of decades assuming that once your husband was settled, they could leave his brother with him and move on with their own lives.   \n\n\nHubby and I have both spent a lot of time in disability advocacy, and these conversations suck.  They just do.

He has no intention of helping.", "How do you know it wasn\u2019t?", "He\u2019s non-verbal and who knows what he thinks?", "My thoughts exactly.\n\nOP is NTA.", "What are you talking about? They definitely didn't wait until OP was locked in as not just a wife, but a SAHM as well, just so they could abuse the situation to their advantage!  That would be crazy! /s", "This is important OP. Protect yourself. As someone who works in the medical field and WITH training about body mechanics, it's a very backbreaking work even tho you may know how to move properly. Plus, you're taking care of your baby. It puts a strain not only on your body but also on your mind. The brother's parents need to look after their own kid and not just dump it on anyone because it's their kid. If they don't want to put him in a special care home, hire a nurse who knows what they're doing and can ask for proper equipment. Do not let yourself get taken advantage of. Have a discussion with your husband and lay it out to him why you shouldn't be looking after someone else's kid.", "you would need a special bed that can be lifted to a reasonable height to not injure your back when changing a grown adult's diaper. i've worked in a carehome for disabled people, and any client not able to visit the toilet needed such a special bed when they reached a certain weight because of this. on top of that, disabled adults with the capacities of babies/toddlers can be dangerous because they can still throw tantrums, when a toddler kicks or bites you when angry it's annoying but when an adult does that it can severely injure someone. same with the innocent grabbing and pinching babies can do, when an adult does it it can do a lot more damage", "I second this statement.   I work as a caregiver for elderly, disabled people.   It is a ton of work.", "They can also severely injure you, intentionally or not\u2026", "I hate that my brain works like this, but... wow... this never was brought up before you were um... married and had a baby? Was there no mention of this prior to you being essentially unemployed at home with an infant? Because you seem pretty adamant that this is NOT something you'd choose, and it feels like reading a Frank Herbert novel about plans within plans within plans. NTA op. Protect yourself and your child.", "Exactly what I thought! It is totally understandable for the brother to not want to take care of his brother, but HOW is it ok to just let his wife do it? WTF\nNTA", "Your husband is quite the AH. Trying to emotionally manipulate you into doing something he is unwilling to do himself and the name-calling.", "Adult Protective services in this case", "This something that the husband's parents and the husband needed to establish long ago. \n\nMy younger brother has significant psychiatric issues, and cannot safely live on his own. I have already made it clear to my parents what my involvement will/will not be, and I make that known.", "> I would say the fact OP has a child and wants more DOES NOT need to factor in to her saying No\n\nNo, but it needs to factor into her husband saying 'yes'.   I don't think he has ever really thought about exactly what he would be taking on--he just assumed that some day, his brother would move in with him and his wife, whomever she was, would care for him.   It's been such an accepted part of his life plan that he's probably never really examined what that might mean--or discussed it with the person expected to do the actual work, apparently.", ">besides caring for a newborn is sooo much different than caring for an adult that needs the same care as a baby.\n\nThis is such an important part of it that people don't realize.    I cannot express the difference in the mental/emotional weight you carry when caring for someone who becomes progressively more dependent versus caring for someone who becomes more independent as you care for them.  In the normal scope of things, the intense exhaustion you feel when caring for a small child will be balanced by the progress you see them making--you can see them begin to walk, talk, form relationships, learn self care skills.  Even with developmentally delayed children, you will still see progress, though on a different time table.  But with a severely disabled person, or a person who is in decline, you either don't see any progress or you see a steady loss of skills.   It takes a different kind of toll on your, physically and emotionally.", "> OP's husband is okay with his parents leaving his disabled brother to him and his wife??\n\nNot at all.  He intends for OP to do 100% of the work.", "Ok I wouldn't say that's fair. I do think OP is NTA but when you have a kid you don't expect it to be severely disabled like this, and that is in fact very unlikely. They've been taking care of him for 26 years. Transition of care has to happen at some point. They need to find a nursing facility or live-in caretaker.", "I worked with developmentally disabled adults in a number of settings, including in an assisted living type place  One thing I noticed was that the longer they had spent living with their families, the worse condition they were in overall. It's sad, and I don't want to downplay the importance of family involvement, but it was obvious that having full time professional caregivers in a good setting made a huge difference physically and socially. \n\nJust one small example, muscle contractures are a common issue for people who have cerebral palsy and some other disabilities. They can be improved with various exercises, sleeping splints etc. It was clear that the folks who had professional caregivers earlier had much better managed contractures because the caregivers kept up better with the exercises etc.", "OP's BIL won't be able to do any of those things. From her description, he can't walk, talk, or feed himself. He needs a trained nurse to look after him.", "Yes, and OP really should have had a proactive conversation with her husband before marriage and ask what the long term care plan was for his sibling", "There are other ways he might be able to communicate!", "That\u2019s because he knows she is in a vulnerable situation with being a SAHM. \n\nOP needs to find a job and free herself from him and his extremely entitled family.", "Pay attention to these posts above.  NTA", "i was just thinking of the physical aspect but holy shit yes the mental part is so much harder too. with your own baby when things get difficult you can look forward to a time when they will be more selfsufficient, it won't always be like this. with an adult as severely disabled as OP's BIL you'll know this is your life now, forever, unless you can pawn them off to someone else like his parents are now trying to, or if he dies before you. it's possible BIL can still develop and grow, but he will need help from professionals actually educated for it to achieve that. living and being cared for by a family member 24/7 for the rest of his life will absolutely mean he will not grow and potentially even regress especially when he's suddenly moved to a different environment (from his parents care to OP's care). him moving into a special care home would mean he would at least get proper help during and after his move, and for the rest of his life", "Then she needs to leave, not take on the work of trying to find a placement for him AND trying to convince her husband and in-laws that's the best solution."]}
