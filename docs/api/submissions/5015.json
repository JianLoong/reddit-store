We had been together for 4 years. I was also tested multiple times during our first year of dating because I had been to Planned Parenthood for birth control and a pap smear a bunch of times and they test every visit. So I know I was negative a year after we started dating so\u2026yeah. It\u2019s obviously from infidelity. \n\nAnyway, I called Planned Parenthood to see if I could get tested ASAP and they said my insurance was no longer supported so it\u2019d have to be out of pocket. I called an urgent care that was in network and they recommended I just go to Planned Parenthood because testing is a lot faster. When I told my ex that it\u2019d be an out of pocket expense (well more like a \u201cwell great now I have to pay for this out of pocket so thanks!\u201d) he gave me his credit card to pay for the visit. Well, I got tested and the doctor said it\u2019d be about 5 days until my results come back which was the same estimate the urgent care had given me. She gave me the treatment anyway and told me to take it even if I test negative. So if I had gone to urgent care instead, the cost would\u2019ve been much less and I probably would\u2019ve been told the exact same thing. I told my ex this and he\u2019s saying its unfair that he\u2019ll have to pay the interest for this on his credit card and I should\u2019ve gone to the place in network. I said boo-hoo. I personally find it more unfair that I have to go through all this when I thought I was being responsible. \n\nI do feel bad though because I did choose to go to a place out of network when I could\u2019ve just gone in network. And we were just talking about our finances and going over our plan to tackle out debt so we can buy a condo (obviously not happening now). Despite everything, I feel so bad knowing he wants to get himself in a better place financially.

Your ex was very unlikely to ever experience the long-term sequelae of chlamydia, but it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in individuals with female reproductive systems. PID can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancies, chronic pelvic pain, and abscess formation. It can be quite devastating for the uterus-haver while the penis-haver gets away with fewer consequences.\n\nIt may be hard right now, but I promise that you will be better off without someone like this in your life. I'm not sure where you live IRL, but I would suggest considering therapy to help you process the emotions of this experience.

Do hold him accountable and talk to a lawyer if you are serious about suing as what he did was beyond acceptable.", "NTA\n\nHe got you into this situation, he can pay to get you out of it. He probably wasn't thinking about your future when he was putting you at risk, so you don't need to be thinking about his now. \n\nSide note, it is wild to me, as a non-american, that an STI screen is a financial burden.

His cheating ass is the reason you had to see a doctor.
