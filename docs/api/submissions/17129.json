Target pissed me off a couple weeks ago because I had three items and went through self checkout, only to get home and realize there was a security tag on my shorts. Wtf? No notice or alarm and I had to look online on how to remove it. Some self checkouts are great, but when they require assistance or extra step of verification as I leave, forget it.

And as all corporations the *one* thing that they truly care about is their revenue; and the biggest cost for them is labor. So if they can do entirely how they want, they will slowly get rid of *all* or almost all human cashiers and replace them with self checkout, in order to save the labor cost - and that effects thousands of peoples jobs across country.", "There are people who make a point of using checkouts so more people will have jobs.

Like I need this person to ring me up when it\u2019s the exact same thing. Then their moaning because oh my gosh this line is slow because people have full carts.

It\u2019s the most annoying but I use the 15/10 item or less line then.", "Personally yes, because it reduces the amount of time spent queuing, and I could also attach a value to my time.

The answer isn\u2019t to demand that technology and systems remain obsolete and inconvenient for the sake of people\u2019s current employment, it\u2019s to make sure we have a good social safety net and programs to help people transition to newer more relevant kinds of work that we actually do need people for. It\u2019s not like being a cashier is some ancient dying art that needs to be preserved for the enlightenment of future generations.\n\nDon\u2019t use the self check out if you don\u2019t want to, but don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re making some sort of moral stand by not using it.", "Except it doesn\u2019t protect jobs.

I swear I have a to press rhe help button  every time", "The number of employees at the cashier at my grocery a hasn\u2019t changed with self checkout. It\u2019s just that each lane is more likely to have a dedicated bagger now (used to float), less lanes are open anyway if not peak, and some man the self service (for approvals and loss prevention) whereas there are 1-2 runners depending on time of day to return items promptly or grab things. Self checkouts just improve customer service and plus they can barely fill rosters anyway at many stores (and mine pays okay not completely low wages, but still retail jobs aren\u2019t desirable and inflation makes it hard to live off any retail job). Mostly students and old people in checkout (those making it an actual career seem to be in departments). I wonder how much they truly eliminate retail jobs that would really be filled.", "They aren\u2019t keeping anyone in a job though, the job is stocking the shelves, there isn\u2019t a single person hired in the shop just for checkouts so nobody would lose their jobs if we had none \n\nNow I\u2019ll concede not every store will work the same as the one I work in but from a personal stand point demanding a checkout for a single item will just lead to us telling you where you the self serve is \n\nNow if we get super busy or someone has a full trolley of course that\u2019s a reason to open a checkout", "Yeah, generally speaking, unless I have a full cart (rare these days for hopefully obvious reasons), I only use the \"normal\" lines if the store is in an idle period.", "How about being nice by not cutting if there are open registers?", "Yeah I agree.  But I almost never buy booze - like, once a year if that, and those are zero of the incidents I'm talking about.  They're always just \"wait for person\" who after some indeterminate time comes over and clears it without checking anything.", "That\u2019s theoretically all nice and well, but practically completely irrelevant, because at least in the US we *DON\u2019T* have much of a social safety net or even as much as health insurance for a significant portion of people once they have lost their jobs - and it\u2019s not like people have not been pushing for that for several decades. So in the meantime all we can do is the only pressure that we as consumers have against corporations, which is with our wallets.\n\nIt\u2019s cute of you to assume that the safety net will be in place any time soon to help the cashier who has been a cashier for the last 25 years, while she is transitioning to becoming what, a techie now in her 40s or 50s. Sometimes I just love that naive enthusiasm; unfortunately that\u2019s the kind of naive thinking that draws voters away from certain parties towards some really dangerous ones.\n\nOf course technological innovation can and - maybe? - should not be stopped, but you can\u2019t just innovate and then hope that the social and economical societal problems resulting from it resolve itself, because - spoiler alert: they don\u2019t. And we better figure that stuff out rather sooner than later, because the exact same issue of cashier vs self checkout is going to come next for a lot of other jobs once AI is becoming wider used (one part of the reason for the writers strike right now).", "And what is the price point of these three different categories of employees mentioned? Something tells me that the bagger, the runner and the cashier don\u2019t all make the same amount of money?\n\nSo replacing a store that had let\u2019s say 10 checkouts with cashiers with 5 self checkouts, saving 5 cashiers and instead have the runners and baggers around would *still* save the corporation money, and calculated across the year and if you include benefits (especially if the cashier gets them but the bagger maybe doesn\u2019t), that adds up to quite a bit.\n\nAgain: corporations could not make the full jump to self checkout only, because that would have probably caused at least a bit of protest, but they will gradually do what they can get away with. And in fast food for example that is already a thing; there are fast food restaurants like McDonalds stores where at least front facing there is no worker anymore, just machine order.", "If all of you spend (as an example) half your time stocking shelves and half your time at the checkout then, if you remove all cashiers, only half of you are still needed for stocking shelves.", "The person asked. Cutting means they went in front of the person and stayed there. Asking is not cutting.", "I was gonna write more in my comment but decided against it, but I totally agree with you. I've had the same thing happen to me too and it's definitely annoying especially when you only have a few items and scan them pretty quick.", "Maybe I\u2019m just talking from personal experience too much but that would not happen in the store I work with the amount of work some people do (and the amount of time they\u2019ll waste on tills) \n\nOn the whole having tills will keep help keep more people in jobs industry wide", "This assumes there is literally no other work needing to be done at a grocery store. \n\nGrocery store employment has been increasing, not decreasing. Largely due to the rise of online ordering, curbside pickup, and on-demand shopping services like Instacart.", "It's still cutting. Plus it's rude to the other people who have all been patiently waiting.", "Asking to cut is not the same as cutting.  If the person left, is it still cutting then?  It's not rude to ask. People can wait for 1 item. It's a very small action to be nice."]}
