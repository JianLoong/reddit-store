Self checkouts just improve customer service and plus they can barely fill rosters anyway at many stores (and mine pays okay not completely low wages, but still retail jobs aren\u2019t desirable and inflation makes it hard to live off any retail job). I talked to employees about it because I was creating some freelance training for a similar system (not for my grocery but I couldn\u2019t talk to employees at the place I was freelancing in person) and wondered.

So in the meantime all we can do is the only pressure that we as consumers have against corporations, which is with our wallets.\n\nIt\u2019s cute of you to assume that the safety net will be in place any time soon to help the cashier who has been a cashier for the last 25 years, while she is transitioning to becoming what, a techie now in her 40s or 50s. Sometimes I just love that naive enthusiasm; unfortunately that\u2019s the kind of naive thinking that draws voters away from certain parties towards some really dangerous ones.\n\nOf course technological innovation can and - maybe? - should not be stopped, but you can\u2019t just innovate and then hope that the social and economical societal problems resulting from it resolve itself, because - spoiler alert: they don\u2019t.

Something tells me that the bagger, the runner and the cashier don\u2019t all make the same amount of money?\n\nSo replacing a store that had let\u2019s say 10 checkouts with cashiers with 5 self checkouts, saving 5 cashiers and instead have the runners and baggers around would *still* save the corporation money, and calculated across the year and if you include benefits (especially if the cashier gets them but the bagger maybe doesn\u2019t), that adds up to quite a bit.\n\nAgain: corporations could not make the full jump to self checkout only immediately, because that would have probably caused at least a bit of protest, but they will gradually do what they can get away with.

Plus in this situation, they had a line-free option.", "Lol NTA. As you aptly pointed out, the self checkout was free for her to use. No one is entitled to cut the line because of how few items they have.", "Why did you apologize?", "Nta, but would it have killed you to let her go?", "YTA", "Once something like this happened to me. I was in line with a full cart and someone with a bag of bread asked to cut in line. I replied, absent-minded, that there were cashiers with express lines for people with >15 items, and the woman started screaming that the express lines were too long and I was an entitled piece of shit with no education and it would cost nothing to be polite, and then she threw the bag and sent bread flying all around and left.", "NTA.", "NTA", "Nope. NTA. That's all there is to it.", "NTA", "I will only allow people to cut in front of me if they have two items or less and are going to pay cash.  I once let a little old woman who had five items cut in front of me.  She let the person ring up the five items then produced coupons.  After that she tried three different credit cards, all declined.  Then she took at least 3 minutes to write a check.  The clerk asked for ID and, guess what, she had no id.  All in all it took way more than 10 minutes for her to end up in leaving without her items.  The clerk then had to back her order out which took another 5 minutes or so since she was new and didn't know how to do it.", "Some self check outs are amazing (I'm looking at you, Target!)

Most people go through it to avoid awkward conversations with the staff or human beings, I'd say, or they just prefer to scan their own items. I prefer to serve myself because I personally think I'm faster, and I like to pack my own bags. I wouldn't say the person who wrote the rules is an AH. They've only opened up this system just to help offload the stress and pure pressure for their workers. I'm not speaking on behalf of one company. Many other businesses are different. Just gotta deal with it or go through a manned checkout and wait like everyone else. Patience is key", "I always use the self checkout a there is always a huge line for it at my store, idk where you are shopping.", "At the grocery stores here most people prefer self checkout. I hate getting in line for self checkout and seeing all eight spots taken by people with full carts.", "I've waved people in front of me at self checkout because they have like three items and I have like 15 but nobody has ever ASKED me to skip. That's so rude.", "People are always using the self check outs where I live. It\u2019s less people touching your groceries, so why not?", "If you have a full cart it\u2019s easier to go to a regular check out lane because there\u2019s more space", "Lol accurate, but also, I think that\u2019s the nature and point of social media.", "The self-checkout was a great solution to that person's problem. A better one since they were still going to have to wait in line, in fact.

I could understand if it was some kind of emergency, but impatience is not an emergency.  When one person chooses to inconvenience someone or everyone else because it\u2019s more convenient for them, by cutting in line for example, they are the AH.  I might even go so far as to say NAH just because she asked, but that even depend on circumstances.  In any event, I don\u2019t judge someone to be an AH for declining to be inconvenienced.", "So, because you choose to let someone in, anyone who does not is an AH?

There's no safety issue with a cashier's line.", "I do this too with a small number of items and only cash... And knowing the people had been waiting and I just showed up. I'd Never have the audacity to ask to cut in line.\n\nI have been Offered to go first a few times, and if that's the case, I take it. But giving people sour looks because I didn't get to checkout before them is childish and they don't deserve to cut line. \n\nLine rules(literally since childhood this is a thing), first come first served.

Explain to me how that is that lazy and inconsiderate?", "Sometimes people buy things that are a nightmare at self checkout. A greeting card never gets noticed on the scale even though it is in the bagging area.

Self checkout is faster in every way so what's your excuse for not using it?", "I didn't say to not use self checkout at all, i said when they have only a couple things, large/unwieldy stuff like soda is perfectly fine to use the cashier lane", "Bullshit on what? You think all employees like dealing with customers like that? because i assure you they don't", "Sometimes, when I see someone driving dangerously, I let them in front of me.

The technology and setup isn\u2019t nearly at a point where it can completely replace cashiers, and even if it did get to that point, I\u2019d probably be against it going that far. Banks didn\u2019t get rid of all their tellers just because ATMs and later online banking decreased the need for them, after all, and I\u2019d think it\u2018d be smartest for stores to go that route, too.", "Lol you\u2019re a misinformed sanctimonious weenie \n\nLook up some stats, there is no correlation with rise of self check out and loss of jobs\n\nOther industries? Yes, but not this one as stores were already having the bare minimum and they just swapped the meat cashier from the express lane to a regular one \n\nYour post is in the same vein as blaming energy issues on people taking long showers, this is a huge systematic issue and individual action are a drop of piss in the ocean", "Look, I think there\u2019s room for both cashiers and self checkouts in stores. Self checkouts are great for people with social anxiety or who only need a few items, and cashiers are great for people who want the human connection or have a lot more to buy. It doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing here. Even with the photography example I mentioned earlier, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s no need for people that can do the older forms of print photography, it\u2019s just we don\u2019t need nearly as many of them as we used to.\n\nAnd there are a lot more job options than a techie that a cashier can still do. People are still capable of change at 40 or 50. If you want to make a stand against the ageism that might prevent businesses from hiring older workers, or needless degree requirements for jobs that really don\u2019t need them, or poverty wages, or even just the fact that so many businesses won\u2019t even allow their cashiers to sit when they\u2019re at the register, sure, I can get behind all that. But this whole \u2018losing cashiers to self checkout\u2019 outrage is just useless virtue signaling as far as I\u2019m concerned.", "I think they do make the same money at my local (well maybe different based on if they can do all roles, seniority, performance record). But it\u2019s the same people in the roles, the purpose is so you know who is going to stay for loss prevention or at the register vs go get stuff etc. Like the bagger can step away but the cashier needs to call a manager because the register is keyed to them, etc. I\u2019ve seen them in different roles and they switch roles but there are \u201cpositions\u201d because some must be continually covered and others can run to grab carts etc. I\u2019m sure every store and situation is different though. As to benefits, I think none of the part time folks really get benefits, and many front (cashiers space) aren\u2019t full time. All of the ones that are seem to also stock a section but not work in a department. I\u2019m guessing to be full time you probably work in multiple capacities (none wildly difficult or specialized or anything)? As to training, you have to train workers to each workflow so I think of the positions that say in general even when an employee may work \u201cacross positions\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s just my brain, apologies, because my profession is creating employee training (though not usually for retail).", "How is that inconsiderate for everyone else in the line?
