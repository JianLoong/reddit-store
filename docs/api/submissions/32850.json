I'm part of a hobby group for gaming, and when I get there, I'll hug some of the other members (only if they're okay with it), sit close, engage in flirty banter, etc.\n\nHowever, I purposefully don't touch and avoid interaction with one guy there (Alex). Alex told us he's autistic. He has a real issue with the fact that I'll be physically affectionate with other guys (and girls, but he ignores that part), and engage in flirty banter with other guys, but not him. Honestly, I don't like him very much.\n\nHe's always ignoring social cues, getting too close, making inappropriate comments, or touching people inappropriately. I, as well as other people, have had multiple extensive conversations with him about his behavior, but he just \"doesn't get it\". In the end, we've given up on trying to explain the nuances of why he can or can't do certain things with certain people, and have tried giving him black-and-white rules, such as \"Don't touch anyone unless they explicitly ask you to\", or \"Do not make those sorts of comments to anyone.\" and it still hasn't really worked to curb his behavior.\n\nHis main gripe is that he sees me hugging or touching other people, and I don't have to ask them beforehand, so why can't he? Or I can make certain comments, but he can't. He's also really really upset that a lot of the other guys will get hugs, and he doesn't.\n\nWe have tried explaining multiple times, but he makes excuses or because he \"doesn't get it\" he'll just ignore it. He doesn't like the black-and-white rules, because he says we're being \"lazy\" for not making him understand why. He'll complain that we're not \"being fair\", and we're being hypocrites because it's \"rules for thee but not for me\".\n\nUnsurprisingly, I've been avoiding Alex and I don't include him in anything that I'm doing. I had a frank talk with the guy in charge of the group, as well as other members, and told them that if Alex was going to keep being a part of the activities, then I'm sorry, but I can't continue. Now there are talks about Alex getting kicked out.\n\nAlex is claiming that I'm being an asshole for not \"helping him\" and not being more tolerant or understanding of him and his condition. He says I'm bullying him by always excluding him, and for getting him (maybe) kicked out.\n\nWhile I get that social cues can be really hard for people with autism, and if no one explains it to them it can be really hard for them to learn, I also feel that it's not my responsibility. I tried. It's also been pointed out that we could have made the environment less triggering for him, for example, but making sure everyone followed the rules we tried to enforce for him, like asking before touching anyone, or just not hugging anyone in front of him, but I don't think that's realistic.\n\nAITA for always excluding an autistic guy and potentially getting him kicked out?", "created_utc": 1702295428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fssxq/aita_for_getting_an_autistic_guy_kicked_out_of_my/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His behavior was troubling, and while I did explain in the beginning, I stopped explaining to him why and would just avoid him. I offered friendship and affection to other people in front of him, and not him, which was very triggering for him. I took no action to stop triggering him.

Maybe he truly cannot grasp the social nuances but he should be able to *stop touching you* and hasn't been able to.

Perhaps someone who is better/more patient can try again and clarify that \u201cpeople who have established relationships and trust with each other do gain a degree of closeness and don\u2019t need to ask every single time. Just like your parent can parent you as their child but may not parent another child to the same degree.\u201d Or even be blunt and say \u201cWe ask you to ask bluntly until stated otherwise because it is hard for us to use subtle social cues and be understood. OP can read the cues well and has established relationships with some of us. It\u2019s similar to being in a different language, native speakers may have faster interactions because they can gauge nuances faster while a second language speaker may need to try and be a bit clearer first. It is hard and frustrating but hopefully with time and practice it will get easier. Getting mad at OP isn\u2019t helpful\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know how emotional these conversations have gotten, but being autistic doesn\u2019t automatically make you bad at boundaries or unable to listen to no\u2019s. People with neurodivergences can still be jerks and that jerkishnsss isn\u2019t part of their diagnosis. \n\nYou may want to check in with the group though and make sure that your level of flirtation actually is welcome.

He's just weaponizing his diagnose to get away with being a creep. I know people with autism and they know when to stop they stop.

You have to realize that you ***are*** setting \"rules for thee but not for me.\" You touch people all the time without asking which is setting an example of how touching should be done, and then you're punishing him for following this example. He doesn't understand social cues, so he's going to mimic the behavior he sees around him in an effort to make up for this shortcoming. ***You're*** setting bad examples, and then punishing him for following them.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to teach him social cues, but you have created a situation where you and everyone else follows one set of rules, and he has another set. That's inherently exclusionary, and it can definitely be confusing for someone who is autistic. He genuinely may not understand boundaries and social cues and is trying to learn by emulating the behavior he sees. You have to realize you're essentially punishing him for trying to behave the way he sees you behave.\n\nInstead of excluding him from activities and getting him kicked out of a group he likely enjoys being a part of, why don't you start setting better examples? Stop touching and flirting with people without consent. Ask people if you can hug them before you hug them, and demonstrate how you want him to behave. The \"rules for thee but not for me\" approach you have is bullshit and 100% exclusionary.\n\n>It's also been pointed out that we could have made the environment less triggering for him, for example, **but making sure everyone followed the rules we tried to enforce for him, like asking before touching anyone, or just not hugging anyone in front of him, but I don't think that's realistic**.\n\nThis is also BS. How is having one set of universal rules not realistic? I think you need to take a step back and realize that your behavior is arguably not appropriate in this setting to begin with. Touching, flirting, hugging, etc., are not behaviors that are inherently part of a gaming group. Just because others are okay with these forms of touching, doesn't mean they're appropriate or normal for this setting. Especially when you've chosen to use these forms of physical affection as a way to exclude someone else.\n\nYou need to enforce the rules for ALL members, including yourself. You don't NEED to touch everyone and flirt with everyone in this group. Your like of physical affection shouldn't make you an exception to the rule, and if you insist on touching people then you need to set a proper example of asking for consent each and every time you do so. A set of rules for everyone else, and a set of rules for Alex, is again, exclusionary.

He wants to be a part and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. OP, I completely understand where you're coming from as the boy I worked with also was very touchy and wanted to be included in everything, although most people didn't want him to be. Sorry, it's your problem. These kids need some extra care, and if you don't want to meet him then YOU should leave.\n\nAlso, I know autism is not a \"do what you want\" pass, however people with this condition need things explained to them in a very specific way. Again, when I was working with that boy he only responded to instructions said In a specific way. It's not his fault that he doesn't understand.
