I know I\u2019m kind of young to be on Reddit but I need help. I\u2019m currently on my period and only use pads because tampons make me uncomfortable. \n\nIn January my family got a dog. I\u2019m not really a fan of dogs but I tolerate her. When I replace a pad, I wrap it up in toilet paper or wrap it in the wrapper of the new pad and seal it closed with the little tape still on the wrapper. This has never been a problem until we got a dog. She likes going into the bathroom and taking my used pads out of the trash and ripping them apart. For the last couple months, I\u2019ve had to chase her around the house and clean up ripped apart pads, but it\u2019s never really bothered the rest of my family as long as I\u2019m the one cleaning them up. \n\nToday, the dog got to a pad I had thrown away earlier this morning. I caught her and threw the pad back in the trash and closed the bathroom door so she couldn\u2019t get to the trash again. While I was in my bedroom, my dad confronted me about it. He told me that the dog kept getting my pads out of the trash and that it was a problem. I was confused and asked him what he wanted me to do about it since the only way to dispose of a pad is to throw it away. He told me that he wanted me to \u201cgrow the fuck up and start using tampons.\u201d I was horrified. I told him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with tampons and that he didn\u2019t get to talk to me about my period. He asked why not. I was speechless and had no idea what to say and just started crying from the embarrassment and shock and shut my bedroom door. \n\nMy mom (47f) is currently in Florida visiting family but she was my last resort. I\u2019ll copy and paste the exact message I sent her. \u201cTell Dad to stay in his own fucking lane and leave me alone because he just told me I \u201chad to grow up and start using tampons\u201d so that the dog would stop eating my pads. He doesn\u2019t get to say that to me, it\u2019s not fair. I can\u2019t help that my uterus sheds every month and I go through almost unbearable pain and his only remark is that I have to grow up and use something I\u2019m not comfortable with.\u201d \n\nI know it sounds a bit bratty, but I was crying my eyes out and had no idea what to say. She\u2019s furious with him. She texted back saying it was inappropriate that he said that to me and that it was a total dick move on his part and it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I have no idea what she texted him but I haven\u2019t seen or talked to him since. I think he\u2019s probably mad at me for bringing my mom into this and I don\u2019t know how to confront him. AITAH?\n\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all so much for advice and being so understanding in the comments. I\u2019ve scrolled through quite a bit and a lot of people are asking how using tampons would fix the situation and why using tampons is a sign of me \u201cgrowing up.\u201d Both my mom and twin sister use tampons and flush them. I\u2019m the only one in the house that currently uses pads as my 8 year old sister obviously doesn\u2019t have a period yet. He thinks that flushing tampons down the toilet is normal and that I just need to grow up and start using tampons like my twin.\n\nUPDATE 2: Thank you all so much for even MORE supportive comments and suggestions and I told my mom that I caved and posted on Reddit and that everyone suggested getting a trash bin with a lid and she agreed. When she returns from Florida tomorrow, we\u2019ll get a bin with a lid. The only reason my dad isn\u2019t buying the trash bin today and solving the problem quicker is because my mom doesn\u2019t want him to get an ugly one lmao.", "created_utc": 1692976435, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16121g1/aitah_for_telling_my_dad_he_doesnt_get_to_talk/", "score": 12896, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has no right to pressure you to use tampons and it won't even solve the issue.

Solution is keep the door closed.", "I'm honestly inclined to say a gentle ESH. Let me say that I do understand how embarrassing our periods can be at your age and I never wore tampons either. That being said, can you not take your pads to the kitchen trash instead? Neither of you are attempting to find a solution and the dog is being a dog. I would encourage you to ask your mom if the three of you can have a conversation together because you all live in the same home and sometimes we have to compromise. It was a bit out of line for your dad to tell you to wear tampons; however, it's a bit out of line to tell your dad he doesn't get to talk about your period. You're both speaking from frustration which is rarely productive.", "ESH\n\nI say you suck because you just kept doing the same thing with your pads and expected different results.

Even bigger for thinking he needs to train you and not the dog.\n\nYou don't approach him to discuss that again, but rather what steps can be taken to keep the dog out of the trash.\n\nDogs LOVE to dumpster dive and will eat pads, Q-tips, used Kleenex, etc. They are probably sad we flush used toilet paper down.\n\nY'all need to get a new garbage can for the bathroom that the dog can't open, or put a small one up on the sink area for your period pads. Or put a baby gate on the bathroom door, that's what we ended up doing.\n\nYou'll have your period for the next 40 years or so...know there are many options and that you may change your mind as you go along. Period panties are great, so are cups. You can get birth control that makes you only have your period once every 3 months...or shots so you don't get it at all. I'm not saying you need to change, just hoping you'll keep your mind open to options - which have nothing to do with the dog. :)\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nWhy he thinks the dog wouldn't go for tampons, I have no idea. So he seems to be rather foolish.\n\nThe problem you have is that the dog raids the bathroom bin. You using tampons isn't a solution, regardless of whether or not you'd find them comfortable or convenient. The solution is to keep the dog away from the bin. Which probably means you need to keep the bathroom door closed, because I've never met a bin with a lid that a dog couldn't open.\n\nGet spring closers for your bathroom doors.

IMO an adult who owns an animal is responsible for buying safety equipment for the animal, including trash cans with lids if the animal is eating out of the trash can.  Also, an adult who has a teenage daughter can educate themselves on how bodies differ, and make sure she has all supplies needed to have a comfortable period.  I don't see how OP sucks here.

So yeah, it can happen to the best of us.", "It's very likely they were changed around the same time people were literally blocking up and breaking city sewer lines with the \"flushable\" wipes. And the city has ways to track back to where they came from and WILL charge people for the repairs. \nIn the early 90s my mother taught me to flush them, in the mid 90s when we moved to a home on septic tank, that changed and you put them in the trash bin. 4 years of using the trash bin trained me to just always do that, and I never saw the change to flushable/nonflushable because I already wasn't flushing them.", "I'd be worried it might transubstantiate in the pipes, and that could cause some real problems.

Flush em down with some wet wipes and we'll see what'll happen.", "Yeah, I didn\u2019t learn you weren\u2019t supposed to until my 20s. I think it says on the packaging that you can and my mom did (or at least never told me to toss them, I just went by what the box said) and it wasn\u2019t until the house I was renting with a bunch of other girls had plumbing problems that we ALL learned not to flush them.", "Thanks for the support. I was the youngest of 6 girls (and 2 boys). Pure chaos in house-training.", "I\u2019m in the same boat. My narcissist mom refused acknowledging my period and I never knew flushing tampons wasn\u2019t the great thing about using them, until my husband told me, after his mom told me after staying overnight. She hit me with \u201cour pipes are old please don\u2019t flush the tampons.\u201d I have yet to figure out she knew. (Yikes) So I stopped flushing, but just at her house. I kid you not. I know I sound like an idiot, but everywhere else in my life I am decently equipped to handle new concepts. Despite this, it came up with my husband again and I was floored this was not an accepted practice. I called every female I knew, including my mom and quickly realized I was the only flusher of tampons. I am nearly in menopause now but the freedom and  cleanliness of flushing a tampon is amazing. I promise I stopped doing it, but I swear,  I never understood how a public bathroom could smell so foul on a hot summer day and would wonder why more people weren\u2019t using tampons assuming that distinct odor was from only people using gross pads.", "Yes. How dare I believe what I read on the package because I had to teach myself everything. Apparently, that makes me stupid for not understanding the intricacies of the city sewer system as a preteen.

If a lidded bin is affordable for the family budget (my assumption: Dad didn't say 'we can't afford.it' he said 'I don't need it's), it should be enough that you, or anyone else in the house needs it.

Weirdly long story actually, but the short version is I was at my friends house and we saw the plastic applicator part of a tampon in a sewage thing?? and we giggled because we were kids and tampons were silly. \n\nSo I go home and tell my mom about it, and she laughs and says \"That's not even the part you're supposed to flush\", and I had like \"the talk\" in school about periods, so I said \"Wait, you're not supposed to flush any part of the tampon though?\" so she googled it, and was like \"Oh yikes.

And tampons are *worse* imo because a dog can eat them more easily. My parents dog ate my sister's tampon (she did this maybe twice in her 15 years with us, so was very unexpected).

We're all different and of course different things work for different people. I just feel compelled whenever I see menstrual cup discussions to say that the changing in public bathrooms thing is usually not as big a problem as people think it will be. Cups hold a lot (mine has a 30 ml capacity; a quick google tells me that most periods consist of 5-80ml of fluid total) and the risk of TSS is much lower than tampons, so it's generally fine to go 8-12 hours before emptying it. Assuming your flow is within the normal range and you can find a cup that fits your body, it's usually possible to time things so you never have to clean it in public.
