I know I\u2019m kind of young to be on Reddit but I need help. I\u2019m currently on my period and only use pads because tampons make me uncomfortable. \n\nIn January my family got a dog. I\u2019m not really a fan of dogs but I tolerate her. When I replace a pad, I wrap it up in toilet paper or wrap it in the wrapper of the new pad and seal it closed with the little tape still on the wrapper. This has never been a problem until we got a dog. She likes going into the bathroom and taking my used pads out of the trash and ripping them apart. For the last couple months, I\u2019ve had to chase her around the house and clean up ripped apart pads, but it\u2019s never really bothered the rest of my family as long as I\u2019m the one cleaning them up. \n\nToday, the dog got to a pad I had thrown away earlier this morning. I caught her and threw the pad back in the trash and closed the bathroom door so she couldn\u2019t get to the trash again. While I was in my bedroom, my dad confronted me about it. He told me that the dog kept getting my pads out of the trash and that it was a problem. I was confused and asked him what he wanted me to do about it since the only way to dispose of a pad is to throw it away. He told me that he wanted me to \u201cgrow the fuck up and start using tampons.\u201d I was horrified. I told him that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with tampons and that he didn\u2019t get to talk to me about my period. He asked why not. I was speechless and had no idea what to say and just started crying from the embarrassment and shock and shut my bedroom door. \n\nMy mom (47f) is currently in Florida visiting family but she was my last resort. I\u2019ll copy and paste the exact message I sent her. \u201cTell Dad to stay in his own fucking lane and leave me alone because he just told me I \u201chad to grow up and start using tampons\u201d so that the dog would stop eating my pads. He doesn\u2019t get to say that to me, it\u2019s not fair. I can\u2019t help that my uterus sheds every month and I go through almost unbearable pain and his only remark is that I have to grow up and use something I\u2019m not comfortable with.\u201d \n\nI know it sounds a bit bratty, but I was crying my eyes out and had no idea what to say. She\u2019s furious with him. She texted back saying it was inappropriate that he said that to me and that it was a total dick move on his part and it wouldn\u2019t happen again. I have no idea what she texted him but I haven\u2019t seen or talked to him since. I think he\u2019s probably mad at me for bringing my mom into this and I don\u2019t know how to confront him.

Perhaps your father could apply himself to that issue?", "First of all, NTA.\n\nBut more relevant....YOU CAN'T FLUSH TAMPONS! If you used tampons, the dog would probably still go in the garbage for them...so what's the difference. If he expects you to flush tampons, he should expect to pay thousands in plumbing bills. \n\n\n But you should make an effort to keep the door closed. Talk to your mom about maybe getting a garbage can that locks. Not because your dad's behavior is in any way, okay, but you wouldn't be expected to chase the dog with your pads if they can't get to them.", "NTA. What the fuck is your Dads problem? I'm a man with no knowledge of this stuff, but why on earth would switching to tampons change this.\n\nI'd tell your Dad to grow up and teach his dog not to go through he trash. Maybe speak to your Mom (since your Dad sounds super unreasonable) about buying a new bathroom garbage that would be harder for the dog to get into.\n\nEdit: typos.", "You weren't bratty, you were upset.

Nta I'm so sorry you have to deal with that his dog needs intervention.", "NTA: First off, tampons are disposed of the same way pads are. One should never flush a tampon.\n\nSecond: Put the trash can under the sink if it has doors so the dog can't get in the trash.\n\nThird: Your father is a complete ah if he's never talked to you about your body and what's happening with it but now decides he can have a blunt conversation with you because he's inconvenienced. It is healthy for female and male parents and children to be able to talk about these things but it should always be done with kindness and respect and the minute the child seems uncomfortable the parent should back the hell up.", "Don't tampons get disposed of the same way? so how would that help? also it's none of his business, very inappropriate NTA", "You didn't do anything wrong.

And it is about time he trains his stupid dog, as if he continues to put its needs ahead of yours he can expect to live in a dungeon in the care home.", "Ugh. You poor thing. NTA. Your father dies need to stay in his lane. He also needs to train the damned dog.", "NTA\n\nMy childhood dog did this. We replaced all the bathroom trash cans with ones with lids. It's really that easy. Your dad was being a major dick.", "NTA. And I will say as a woman with dogs - if they are taking your pads out of the garbage, they will take your tampons out too. He has no right to pressure you to use tampons and it won't even solve the issue. A small garbage can with a lid that you can put up on a counter or shelf the dog can't reach, or that you can attach a locking mechanism to, might.

End of story.", "NTA and I'm not sure how tampons would help the problem anyway since you can't flush them. Can you just put the wastebasket up on a counter or put the pads in a trash bag and hang it up out of reach?", "Dogs eat tampons too.  That wouldn't change anything.   Solution is keep the door closed.", "I'm honestly inclined to say a gentle ESH. Let me say that I do understand how embarrassing our periods can be at your age and I never wore tampons either. That being said, can you not take your pads to the kitchen trash instead? Neither of you are attempting to find a solution and the dog is being a dog. I would encourage you to ask your mom if the three of you can have a conversation together because you all live in the same home and sometimes we have to compromise. It was a bit out of line for your dad to tell you to wear tampons; however, it's a bit out of line to tell your dad he doesn't get to talk about your period. You're both speaking from frustration which is rarely productive.", "ESH\n\nI say you suck because you just kept doing the same thing with your pads and expected different results. Eating that plastic isn't good for the dog.\n\nBut your dad is a huge AH for not understanding that you get to deal with your period as you like/see fit. Even bigger for thinking he needs to train you and not the dog.\n\nYou don't approach him to discuss that again, but rather what steps can be taken to keep the dog out of the trash.\n\nDogs LOVE to dumpster dive and will eat pads, Q-tips, used Kleenex, etc. They are probably sad we flush used toilet paper down.\n\nY'all need to get a new garbage can for the bathroom that the dog can't open, or put a small one up on the sink area for your period pads. Or put a baby gate on the bathroom door, that's what we ended up doing.\n\nYou'll have your period for the next 40 years or so...know there are many options and that you may change your mind as you go along. Period panties are great, so are cups. You can get birth control that makes you only have your period once every 3 months...or shots so you don't get it at all. I'm not saying you need to change, just hoping you'll keep your mind open to options - which have nothing to do with the dog. :)\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nWhy he thinks the dog wouldn't go for tampons, I have no idea. So he seems to be rather foolish.\n\nThe problem you have is that the dog raids the bathroom bin. You using tampons isn't a solution, regardless of whether or not you'd find them comfortable or convenient. The solution is to keep the dog away from the bin. Which probably means you need to keep the bathroom door closed, because I've never met a bin with a lid that a dog couldn't open.\n\nGet spring closers for your bathroom doors.

Train it to stay out of the trash, get a trash with a lid, put the trash up high..literally anything BUT yelling at your daughter to use tampons. YOU did not make things awkward with your dad,  HE made things awkward with you. There is nothing grown up about tampons and there is nothing childish about pads.", "NTA!!! My daughter is at the age where she'll be expecting her first period soon. We had the talk and she made it clear she wasn't comfortable with tampons, and I feel she doesn't ever have to be comfortable with them.  I would never tell her to grow up and use them.  You shouldn't have to change anything you're doing just because the dog is ripping your pads apart.  \n\nDad needs to channel his energy into training the dog to stay out of the trash, which is totally possible with some patience and commitment on dad's part.", "NTA at all. \n\nI\u2019m a grown woman and I\u2019d cringe if someone said that to me. \n\nGet a pedal bin or a bin with a lid for the bathroom.", "your dog will still mess with your tampons. tell your dad to buy a trash can with a reliable lid, or put something heavy on the lid during your monthly. source: i had to make my dog puke last month because she suddenly started going in the bathroom trash and ate my tampon. nta", "NTA  \n\n\nYour dad is the asshole here, and your mom is totally right to tell him to stay in his lane.

Your dad really doesn't have any room to speak on a situation like this and you and your mom are right to be upset. Also, if your dad is ignoring you and giving you the silent treatment over this, then it sounds like he's the one who needs to grow up. \n\nSome advice for the dog: I had this problem when my dog was a puppy (and I used tampons, so its really not a matter of what products you're using, your dog will probably do it either way) and she eventually grew out of it, so hopefully it's only a temporary problem for you as well. But, I've also found it helpful to either move the trash into a closet/cupboard in the bathroom to avoid situations like this, or you could even buy a little trash can with a lid if you're able and think that would help. Good luck!", "NTA. Tell your dad to get a metal trash can with a lid for the bathroom so the dog can't get in to it. Flushing tampons isn't the best for pumping anyways so it's not a good solution for the problem.", "I have always hated tampons (they\u2019re super uncomfortable to me) and it wouldn\u2019t have fixed the problem anyway since you can\u2019t flush them.

She's going after the smell of blood.\n\nIf it bothers your dad this much, he needs to be the one to replace the bathroom trash can with one with a lid that the dog can't open AND get the dog into training to teach her to stay out of the trash can.

That is not your responsibility and you didn't do anything wrong.\n\nPeriods suck, and tampons can be uncomfortable or even painful. Your dad has no right to tell you to use them.", "Do you have a cabinet you can put a small trash can into? That\u2019s what we do here because my dog was getting into the trash.

Dad needs to get a garbage can with a lid that the dog can't get into if he wants the problem to start.\n\nHave personal experience with that - that's what my family had to do when we got dogs.  Because dogs will get into pads *and* tampons, and you can't flush either of them.", "FYI, it is often very difficult or impossible to train a dog to stay out of the garbage if the temptation is great enough. Often, the only solution is to prevent them (e.g., closing doors, cans with lids, etc.).", "Exactly! This is why our bathroom doors are nearly always shut. We have a septic tank so I really can't flush tampons, or it would be costly. I have put the garbage can into the under sink cabinet when we first moved in. But still, keep the door closed.

Not only are you NTA, and your father a huge AH, but his 'solution' wouldn't solve anything.\n\nIn fact, a dog can simply eat tampons--which can result in an obstruction and pricey vet bills for surgery (or just really embarrassing moments at the dog park getting the passed tampon all the way out).\n\nThe solutions are: get a trash bin with a lid that snaps closed, close the bathroom door, and train the dog.\n\nSorry your dad's an AH.", "Yes, thank you!! A bathroom trash with a lid has been suggested before but he said we didn\u2019t need one.", "This exactly.\n\nThe dog will just grab the tampon out of the trash and chew that up.
