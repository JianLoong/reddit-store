By your own admission you're not done repaying the money, so you haven't even finished this step yet.\n\n2) One of the other steps towards re-earning her trust is keeping your promises to her. If you think the promise was unreasonable, the right thing to do was to \\*talk\\* \\*to\\* \\*her\\* about it, and get agreement that the promise isn't working anymore. Unilaterally breaking the promise you made teaches her that you are \\*still\\* not trustworthy, because you still think you have the right to overrule her whenever you feel like it. \n\n3) The fact that you refuse to consider selling the things you bought with joint money is very telling.
