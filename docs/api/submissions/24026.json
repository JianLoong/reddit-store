The deal was for my sister to come back for him after a year or less, moving to America would\u2019ve been amazing for my family because we were financially struggling, my sister knew this. She AGREED to come take her child but ghosted me at the last second.

And before my sister gave him to me, they lived together although he was very little at the time", "Yeah she is! She is only married to him because divorce process is quite expensive in my country, but they are in the process of divorcing!

It would actually not have been hard to get a visa or passport issued once the mother is issued one. The only wrinkle would have been if the other parent did not allow it, which it doesn't seem like the other parent was even aware of what was happening. Your sister knew damn well what she was doing and you fell for it. She wanted a new, child-free life. She intentionally abandoned her kid. She made no effort to come get her child\n\nYou have a similar opportunity to yoyr sister and she wants to deny you it to raise her child. Think about that. She doesn't care what happens as long as her guilt can be justified that she left her son with family. This is enough. This is not a good situation for you or the kid. No way he doesn't feel like a burden right now because unfortunately, though it's not his fault, he is. You cannot even get the paperwork to take him with you without your sister or his father. I only hope his dad can provide stability now. Keep in touch with him though, and see if you and his dad can actually work out the paperwork to get a passport so he can visit you, too, to make the transition easier on him.", "Hang on, she abandoned her child for what, 3 years? And then has a tantrum when your life changes and you can no longer mother her child?! Why the big deal with the husband, is he incapable of looking after his son or something? \nI mean, as her husband does he have parental rights? And why didn\u2019t he have his child from the beginning? I hope she\u2019s well paid, I can see a lot of therapy in that boy\u2019s future due to her shite parenting\n\nEdit, NTA, you have a life to lead as well", "Honestly I can't render a verdict but how my heart hurts for that kid, first his mum abandons him and now the only family her really knew has left, along with his gran dying. I get he is with his dad now but the consistent adult in his life has now disappeared, I'm not judging you for moving, you obviously had to do what was best and you said you would have took him.\n\nWill you stay in touch with him and will you actually miss the wee mite? Please don't fully abandon him.", "NTA. It was up to your sister to get her son a passport but she didn't care so didn't bother. It's he t responsibility and she blocked youvso giving him to his dad made sense", "I honestly just feel bad for that poor boy, feeling completely unwanted in this world.", "NTA\n\nShe abandoned her child and she knows it, she didn\u2019t want the kid, on the same hand she didn\u2019t want Dad to have the kid either\n\nSis wanted to have her cake and eat it too, how about you send her a bill for all of the money you spent on her kid, while you\u2019re at it, ask her, what does she even *know* about her child? What is the kids favorite color, what\u2019re they into rn, what size shirt do they wear, etc\n\nAt the end of the day, the moment she left for Canada she knew she was never going to parent that kid, so she needs to stop pretending to be mom when she\u2019s nothing more than an egg donor at this point", "NTA\n\nYou did more than any other parent would have done.

You ruined her perfect revenge by giving son to his father. She has no problem with abandoning his child. She just wants the father to suffer. Your sister is not a good person. Even it is possible that she was good to you for abusing you for such cases.", "If this were the US, he'd get full custody because the mother abandoned the child. Hasn't seen him in years. And I doubt she was paying child support to you.", "Maybe you could add this fact in your Post? The fact, that he visited his son regularily changes *a lot*, at least from my perspective. Reading your post, I assumed the boy didn't really know his father before you dropped him off! (...which would be more stressful for the kid, than the actual situation)\n\nAlso: nta, obviously.", "Yes, the clarification helps since he has already been in his life.", "I'm sure you did your best. Your sister is the biggest asshole for sure I could understand a single mom moving countries and needing a few months to get settled in an apartment and registering for daycare and such but surely sometime in the last 3 years she could have gotten a passport and brought her son to Canada.   Sounds like she just wanted to start her life over", "I did read some of your posts. I am very relieved to know that nephew and dad have a relationship.", "Or an aunt. :( Because he is feeling abandoned right now by the aunt most of all!", "Right? Was he aware that his ex dumped his child with a relative for years? \n\nHe probably has a pretty good case there.", "She was not unfortunately", "Is there a way I could edit? But if not I made a separate post answering questions and clarifying things", "She said IF you wanted more insight into the situation she made a post about it... There's no need for you to be a btch.", "Literally! Under the lame excuse, \u201che doesn\u2019t have a passport\u201d. So I\u2019m three years.. she couldn\u2019t manage to get him a passport? Wtf, she just didn\u2019t want to be a mother.", "More evidence in the dad's favor of why she shouldn't have custody.\n\nMake a list of stuff like this. Then send it to the dad for him to give to his lawyer.", "Illegal?  Seriously?  So a spouse could be brutally abused and they still can't divorce? Only a separation?  Well, that's some kind of bullshit.", "I initially misread this as a law Muslims imposed on the majority Christian population. But I see from Wikipedia that while he was president, Marcos granted Muslims the right to be governed by their own family law, which is why they can divorce even though the majority of the population can't. How fascinating; I had no idea about this aspect of history. I sense an internet rabbit hole in my near future!", "He has to finish all the work the judge gave him, and get a good job and proof he is eligible! He already has a good job and he\u2019s left with about 3 more months till he\u2019s done with the work they gave him!", "According to op's comments he's been deemed unfit by the courts. This poor child!", "Ofc! So my husband travels a lot for work but during this summer he was in the Philippines so I sent my kids there for summer break! My sister went to canada 2020 before the lockdown for work and I lived in ghana with my children and her child ofc!", "More details here:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divorce_in_the_Philippines", "In the Philippines, men can legally kill their wives if caught cheating.  I think it had to be 'in the heart of the moment,' but it's been upheld recently.", "It's the only country in the world with this strong a restriction on divorce.", "The rest of the population is staunchly (radically) Catholic.", "Good. Your nephew will be with a parent who wants him.\n\nUnlike your sister.", "> or maybe she has and she is ignoring them\n\nyeah your sister seems to have a shortlist (1) of people she cares about", "I was reading this and thought \"this sounds like a common story where I'm from\". I think a lot of people commenting might have an American perspective and not be able to make any sense of the situation. \n\nYou did your best. Your sister should have talked to you, should have told you why it's so hard to get her kid and what her plan is. Instead, she buried her head in the sand and trusted that you would be there for her baby forever. Most women in her situation come back for their kid when they're old enough for school and don't need daycare anymore. Or they eventually get consumed by the guilt and shame and never come back. \n\nIf you feel the child is safe with his dad, I believe you and I trust you made a good decision. \n\nTell your sister it's not too late to go get her kid. Tell her that if there are real reasons why she can't, she needs to be honest. Is she in some low wage job where she can't even afford to live and can't possibly make sense of how to get childcare (typical in Canada even for skilled work)? Things were really bad with covid restrictions in Canada so she might have just gotten too overwhelmed to find solutions. She might be treading water trying to tell herself she needs to keep pushing to give her child a good life. As her sister, you might be able to get through to her and get her mind back towards solutions. However, it's her problem and it would have been completely unreasonable for you to delay your own move to stay with her son.", "Your sister is doing some awful things but I would add, the Canadian lock down was pretty severe during covid. Families were separated for over a year in many cases.", "Holy shit.", "I would never want to marry in the first place, just in case.", "Can you explain the countries please? Your sister is in Canada, your husband is in the Philippines. Where were you living bf USA? Is your husband with you now?", "Yes I understand that, but I did not include this due to lack of space but she was a well paying job, it\u2019s not like she works 3 jobs and barely makes ends meet? Where she works pays really well", "However she did not onces call to check up on him", "If she's in Toronto or Vancouver, it's very common and possible to have a \"well paying job\" and be dead broke.", "Yeah, that's the awful part.  I think the only thing she did right was leaving him with family members that cared.  But you can't exactly take him with you legally."]}
