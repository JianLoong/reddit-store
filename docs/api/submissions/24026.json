She needs to get her s't straight and you do you.", "ESH you basically adopted a child for three years and just abandoned him out of the blue when you moved? how can you just abandon basically your child like that? your sister did the same thing, but youre more of a mother to him than she was, and you just abandoned him???", "Nope NTA\n\nYour sister just left her child with you so she could go to Canada -- never came to visit the child, nothing (Im assuming she also didnt help out financially for the child) -- for 3 years! I mean, WHO does that?????\n\nSince she had blocked you, your choices were to either contact the childs father OR contact Child Services. I think you made the right choice. \n\nYou are so NOT selfish, wicked, ungrateful or anything else. You are the polar opposite of those things!\n\nThe ONLY thing that I would be concerned about is that in reality you are the only 'Mother' that child has known so it will be difficult for him. But, the other issue is that you have no custody documents, nothing that would show you had the right to have him, so if there was an accident or issue, you would have problems.", "NTA - your sister's behavior is terrible.     She had ample time to get her kid but then blocks you and she's upset when you make arrangements for his care with the kid's father?     You have nothing to feel guilty about whatsoever.   I hope the father gets full custody.", "NTA. You have nothing to feel guilty for. Hopefully dad isn't as horrible as mom.", "Your sister abandoned her child and somehow you\u2019re the bad person?

You were wonderfully patient and generous to keep your nephew for years while your sister has shown no responsibility for him at all.  It's good his father wanted to assume his care.  That is where it seems he belongs and I hope he is well treated and happy there.  You have nothing to feel guilty about.  Instead, your sister should be forever grateful for what you have done for her son.", "Poor kid", "Nta. Your sister is the selfish one and never deserves to have that child back. She is NO mother", "NTA. Wow your sister is a terrible mother and the kid is prob better off with his father. You gave her plenty of time to sort it out. Your nephew is not your responsibility. You did plenty already. Your sister is selfish and self centred. Poor kid must feel abandoned by his mum. Good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm so sorry your sister spent YEARS ignoring her kid and then ghosted you and THEN got angry when you knew you were backed into a corner.\n\nYou didn't do anything other than be the mother needed to HER child.

Your sister abandoned her child and you returned the child to his father, who will hopefully step up and make that child feel loved.  I feel bad for the kid losing what he must have thought of as his family, but there was no ideal outcome given that his mom literally abandoned him.", "I did not abandon him. The deal was for my sister to come back for him after a year or less, moving to America would\u2019ve been amazing for my family because we were financially struggling, my sister knew this. She AGREED to come take her child but ghosted me at the last second. I had no choice, I couldn\u2019t even make him a passport cause I\u2019m not his legal guardian( trust me I\u2019ve tried) I was stuck and didn\u2019t know what to do", "Yes exactly! I took him to school, paid for his fees, I even asked for little money to buy his medicine whenever he got sick but she always said she will get back to me but never did so I just stopped asking and just provided for all 4 children", "He\u2019s not the bad guy! He always came to visit his child any chance he got!!", "He didn\u2019t have custody before is because he had sort of a criminal record cause he had been to jail onces but he had changed his ways, and my sister made it in her power for him to suffer and never let him see his child again( I\u2019m not so sure if he\u2019s gonna get full custody but he\u2019s trying his full best, I\u2019ll update if anything happens)", "I think we all agree that what your sister did was awful. But what this person is pointing out is that your family is the only family this kid knows, and suddenly you left him with a stranger. You were put in an impossible situation but you don\u2019t seem all that concerned about how this feels for the actual child.", "well then nta.. kid should have been there all along.", "Idk man, my sister wanted me to watch her kid so I did", "I think a reformed person who made some mistakes in life is still a better parent for that boy than a mother who abandoned the child so completely.", "But she is still married to him? \n\nThere are a few things I am not following here.", "I\u2019m sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear in the text, he does know his father, his father visits like every special occasion, birthdays, Christmas, thanksgiving what not but the father was never allowed full custody! And before my sister gave him to me, they lived together although he was very little at the time", "Yeah she is! She is only married to him because divorce process is quite expensive in my country, but they are in the process of divorcing! And as for reasons why the father didn\u2019t have custody is because the judge didn\u2019t think he was a fit, cause of my sisters accusations and because he\u2019s been to jail onces", "NTA\n\nLet's start with your sister suckered you into raising her child. It would actually not have been hard to get a visa or passport issued once the mother is issued one. The only wrinkle would have been if the other parent did not allow it, which it doesn't seem like the other parent was even aware of what was happening. Your sister knew damn well what she was doing and you fell for it. She wanted a new, child-free life. She intentionally abandoned her kid. She made no effort to come get her child\n\nYou have a similar opportunity to yoyr sister and she wants to deny you it to raise her child. Think about that. She doesn't care what happens as long as her guilt can be justified that she left her son with family. This is enough. This is not a good situation for you or the kid. No way he doesn't feel like a burden right now because unfortunately, though it's not his fault, he is. You cannot even get the paperwork to take him with you without your sister or his father. I only hope his dad can provide stability now. Keep in touch with him though, and see if you and his dad can actually work out the paperwork to get a passport so he can visit you, too, to make the transition easier on him.", "Hang on, she abandoned her child for what, 3 years? And then has a tantrum when your life changes and you can no longer mother her child?! Why the big deal with the husband, is he incapable of looking after his son or something? \nI mean, as her husband does he have parental rights? And why didn\u2019t he have his child from the beginning? I hope she\u2019s well paid, I can see a lot of therapy in that boy\u2019s future due to her shite parenting\n\nEdit, NTA, you have a life to lead as well", "Honestly I can't render a verdict but how my heart hurts for that kid, first his mum abandons him and now the only family her really knew has left, along with his gran dying. I get he is with his dad now but the consistent adult in his life has now disappeared, I'm not judging you for moving, you obviously had to do what was best and you said you would have took him.\n\nWill you stay in touch with him and will you actually miss the wee mite? Please don't fully abandon him.", "NTA. It was up to your sister to get her son a passport but she didn't care so didn't bother. It's he t responsibility and she blocked youvso giving him to his dad made sense", "I honestly just feel bad for that poor boy, feeling completely unwanted in this world.", "NTA\n\nShe abandoned her child and she knows it, she didn\u2019t want the kid, on the same hand she didn\u2019t want Dad to have the kid either\n\nSis wanted to have her cake and eat it too, how about you send her a bill for all of the money you spent on her kid, while you\u2019re at it, ask her, what does she even *know* about her child? What is the kids favorite color, what\u2019re they into rn, what size shirt do they wear, etc\n\nAt the end of the day, the moment she left for Canada she knew she was never going to parent that kid, so she needs to stop pretending to be mom when she\u2019s nothing more than an egg donor at this point", "NTA\n\nYou did more than any other parent would have done. She lied to you when she didn't come and pick him up. \n\nYou couldn't even travel with your nephew when he doesn't have a passport and you're not the guardian.
