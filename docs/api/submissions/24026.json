The deal was for my sister to come back for him after a year or less, moving to America would\u2019ve been amazing for my family because we were financially struggling, my sister knew this. She AGREED to come take her child but ghosted me at the last second. I had no choice, I couldn\u2019t even make him a passport cause I\u2019m not his legal guardian( trust me I\u2019ve tried) I was stuck and didn\u2019t know what to do", "Yes exactly!

And before my sister gave him to me, they lived together although he was very little at the time", "Yeah she is! She is only married to him because divorce process is quite expensive in my country, but they are in the process of divorcing!

It would actually not have been hard to get a visa or passport issued once the mother is issued one. The only wrinkle would have been if the other parent did not allow it, which it doesn't seem like the other parent was even aware of what was happening. Your sister knew damn well what she was doing and you fell for it. She wanted a new, child-free life. She intentionally abandoned her kid. She made no effort to come get her child\n\nYou have a similar opportunity to yoyr sister and she wants to deny you it to raise her child. Think about that. She doesn't care what happens as long as her guilt can be justified that she left her son with family. This is enough. This is not a good situation for you or the kid. No way he doesn't feel like a burden right now because unfortunately, though it's not his fault, he is. You cannot even get the paperwork to take him with you without your sister or his father. I only hope his dad can provide stability now. Keep in touch with him though, and see if you and his dad can actually work out the paperwork to get a passport so he can visit you, too, to make the transition easier on him.", "Hang on, she abandoned her child for what, 3 years? And then has a tantrum when your life changes and you can no longer mother her child?! Why the big deal with the husband, is he incapable of looking after his son or something? \nI mean, as her husband does he have parental rights? And why didn\u2019t he have his child from the beginning? I hope she\u2019s well paid, I can see a lot of therapy in that boy\u2019s future due to her shite parenting\n\nEdit, NTA, you have a life to lead as well", "Honestly I can't render a verdict but how my heart hurts for that kid, first his mum abandons him and now the only family her really knew has left, along with his gran dying. I get he is with his dad now but the consistent adult in his life has now disappeared, I'm not judging you for moving, you obviously had to do what was best and you said you would have took him.\n\nWill you stay in touch with him and will you actually miss the wee mite? Please don't fully abandon him.", "NTA. It was up to your sister to get her son a passport but she didn't care so didn't bother. It's he t responsibility and she blocked youvso giving him to his dad made sense", "I honestly just feel bad for that poor boy, feeling completely unwanted in this world.", "NTA\n\nShe abandoned her child and she knows it, she didn\u2019t want the kid, on the same hand she didn\u2019t want Dad to have the kid either\n\nSis wanted to have her cake and eat it too, how about you send her a bill for all of the money you spent on her kid, while you\u2019re at it, ask her, what does she even *know* about her child? What is the kids favorite color, what\u2019re they into rn, what size shirt do they wear, etc\n\nAt the end of the day, the moment she left for Canada she knew she was never going to parent that kid, so she needs to stop pretending to be mom when she\u2019s nothing more than an egg donor at this point", "NTA\n\nYou did more than any other parent would have done.
