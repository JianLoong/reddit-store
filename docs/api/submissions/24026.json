She should not have blocked you, you had not choices but to send kids to their dad (or to the government).  She is a bad person", "So your sister essentially abandons her child, expects you to raise her child for her, then blames you for what exactly? \n\nTell your sister I say she needs to do better. \n\nNTA.", "NTA- Sue abandoned her child, did nothing to get him back, and then got mad at Your for not bringing him to the US with you. Your nephew now has a parent who is in his life. Your sister can work to get custody of the child she abandoned or she can allow him to stay with a parent who has made the choice to be there.", "NTA, but i say you should've dona that sooner. She was happy to dump her kid, but unhappy if he ends up with his father. She needs to get her s't straight and you do you.", "ESH you basically adopted a child for three years and just abandoned him out of the blue when you moved? how can you just abandon basically your child like that? your sister did the same thing, but youre more of a mother to him than she was, and you just abandoned him???", "Nope NTA\n\nYour sister just left her child with you so she could go to Canada -- never came to visit the child, nothing (Im assuming she also didnt help out financially for the child) -- for 3 years! I mean, WHO does that?????\n\nSince she had blocked you, your choices were to either contact the childs father OR contact Child Services. I think you made the right choice. \n\nYou are so NOT selfish, wicked, ungrateful or anything else. You are the polar opposite of those things!\n\nThe ONLY thing that I would be concerned about is that in reality you are the only 'Mother' that child has known so it will be difficult for him. But, the other issue is that you have no custody documents, nothing that would show you had the right to have him, so if there was an accident or issue, you would have problems.", "NTA - your sister's behavior is terrible.     She had ample time to get her kid but then blocks you and she's upset when you make arrangements for his care with the kid's father?     You have nothing to feel guilty about whatsoever.   I hope the father gets full custody.", "NTA. You have nothing to feel guilty for. Hopefully dad isn't as horrible as mom.", "Your sister abandoned her child and somehow you\u2019re the bad person? Please", "is the dad a bad guy? will he abuse the kid?? idk how to answer this unless i know you left him in a safe environment.. sister is def AH though", "NTA at all.  You were wonderfully patient and generous to keep your nephew for years while your sister has shown no responsibility for him at all.  It's good his father wanted to assume his care.  That is where it seems he belongs and I hope he is well treated and happy there.  You have nothing to feel guilty about.  Instead, your sister should be forever grateful for what you have done for her son.", "Poor kid", "Nta. Your sister is the selfish one and never deserves to have that child back. She is NO mother", "NTA. Wow your sister is a terrible mother and the kid is prob better off with his father. You gave her plenty of time to sort it out. Your nephew is not your responsibility. You did plenty already. Your sister is selfish and self centred. Poor kid must feel abandoned by his mum. Good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm so sorry your sister spent YEARS ignoring her kid and then ghosted you and THEN got angry when you knew you were backed into a corner.\n\nYou didn't do anything other than be the mother needed to HER child. Clearly, you couldn't make her get her OWN child and you were kind to no bring in the authorities since she abandoned him for YEARS.", "The Lion, the witch and the audacity of that bitch! \n\n\nShe says that YOU are selfish?  WTF? SHE abandoned (because there are no other words for it) her own child. \n\nNTA. At all. \n\nAnd poor kid will have mommy issues for the rest of his life.", "I cannot even tell you how disgusted I am by your sister's behaviour. She literally abandoned her child, and now has the nerve to treat you like this when she failed to collect him as agreed.\n\nI hope his father can get full custody of him (and I'm not sure I understand why he didn't have custody before given the abandonment by his mother) and stop your sister from meddling in that poor boys life ever again.\n\nYou've done more than could ever be expected and more again.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Your sister abandoned her child and you returned the child to his father, who will hopefully step up and make that child feel loved.  I feel bad for the kid losing what he must have thought of as his family, but there was no ideal outcome given that his mom literally abandoned him.", "I did not abandon him. The deal was for my sister to come back for him after a year or less, moving to America would\u2019ve been amazing for my family because we were financially struggling, my sister knew this. She AGREED to come take her child but ghosted me at the last second. I had no choice, I couldn\u2019t even make him a passport cause I\u2019m not his legal guardian( trust me I\u2019ve tried) I was stuck and didn\u2019t know what to do", "Yes exactly! I took him to school, paid for his fees, I even asked for little money to buy his medicine whenever he got sick but she always said she will get back to me but never did so I just stopped asking and just provided for all 4 children", "He\u2019s not the bad guy! He always came to visit his child any chance he got!!", "He didn\u2019t have custody before is because he had sort of a criminal record cause he had been to jail onces but he had changed his ways, and my sister made it in her power for him to suffer and never let him see his child again( I\u2019m not so sure if he\u2019s gonna get full custody but he\u2019s trying his full best, I\u2019ll update if anything happens)", "I think we all agree that what your sister did was awful. But what this person is pointing out is that your family is the only family this kid knows, and suddenly you left him with a stranger. You were put in an impossible situation but you don\u2019t seem all that concerned about how this feels for the actual child.", "well then nta.. kid should have been there all along.", "Idk man, my sister wanted me to watch her kid so I did", "I think a reformed person who made some mistakes in life is so a better parent for that boy than a mother who abandoned the child so completely.", "But she is still married to him? \n\nThere are a few things I am not following here.", "I\u2019m sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear in the text, he does know his father, his father visits like every special occasion, birthdays, Christmas, thanksgiving what not but the father was never allowed full custody! And before my sister gave him to me, they lived together although he was very little at the time", "Yeah she is! She is only married to him because divorce process is quite expensive in my country, but they are in the process of divorcing! And as for reasons why the father didn\u2019t have custody is because the judge didn\u2019t think he was a fit, cause of my sisters accusations and because he\u2019s been to jail onces"]}
