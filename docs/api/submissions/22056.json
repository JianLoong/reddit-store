The name is shockingly bad and I laughed out loud at it. My friend asked why that was funny and then I realized that she was not only serious but also really liked the name. \nWhen we were both sober, she again brought it up and said she wanted her child to have the same name. She isn\u2019t pregnant but I still gave my two cents on it and told her that the name isn\u2019t just bad, it\u2019s almost laughable. She got really upset and said that it was a beautiful name and felt disrespected that I was acting so hostile. I guess I could have been nicer about it but I still think it needed to be said. So, am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I did some quick google searches and realized that it would be very hard to track down this child as her name is a word in the English language.

You do not defend your opinion, especially not so rudely (which you could have waited to share for laughs with literally ANYone else but her).
