A few months ago my wife began pressuring me to do more around the house. Before I get an instant YTA. We already split chores and child care, admittedly, she had a bigger cut than I because she is a SAHM, but I do most of the cooking, breakfasts and Dinners, Lunch is her responsibility for her and the boys. I take out the garbage and I do laundry, and I deep clean the bathrooms once a week. I do also help with our boys homework and such. \n\nShe insists that I am not doing enough and that I should be doing more around the house. I tried having discussions with her asking what she expected from me (namely all chores and child rearing should be my duty it seems)  and for months it seemed to be going no where. She used the D word more than once when speaking on this which felt manipulative.\n\nIt boiled over when we were out with friends one night, and she began talking about how I never helped out and how I use her as a house slave (her words). I will admit I saw red. \n\nThis next part is where I may be the asshole. I didn't say anything that night but the next day I asked my boss to be given reduced hours for the next little bit, due to stress. \n\nAnd I took over everything in the house. I cooked Breakfast, and made lunch for the boys before I drove them to school, I cleaned the house top to bottom, I did every dish we had twice and so on. My wife was blindingly happy, and bragged to her friend that she finally had me \"worn in\".\n\n She Didn't lift a finger for around a month. Then she began asking why we never went on dates anymore and Complaining that she wanted to get her nails done as they were growing in. I explained that I had to take that out of our budget so we could continue to afford everything else, but we could absolutely have a movie night in, and I could paint her nails for her. She was unhappy with that solution, So I asked her if she would want to get a part time job to pay for either luxury's. You would have thought I asked if she wanted to join a cult.\n\nShe then asked if I could Just pick up more shifts at work to cover her other expenses, and used the phrase \"be a man\". Which I found more than a little insulting. I then asked her if she would be willing to go back to splitting the chores and such? Which is when she began to catch on that the two were related.\n\nShe yelled at me that I was being a manipulative asshole for doing this and even claimed it was financial \"a word\". I stood strong for a while but now I am questioning my methods, because even I feel what I did was a bit underhanded. so AITA?", "created_utc": 1682047609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12towpj/aita_38m_for_cutting_back_on_work_to_prove_a/", "score": 685, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm not sure why your wife doesn't understand that.\n\nDude - you said that your wife is an \"angel\", I'm not really seeing it. Threatening divorce to bludgeon you into doing more housework is a pretty big red flag.", "NTA. You did what she asked. \n\nReading stories like this really make me question if I want to get married.", "The phrases \u201chouse slave\u201d and \u201chaving you worn in\u201d don\u2019t make this marriage even sound like a partnership. Couples therapy asap. You have bigger problems than chores. NTA", "NTA, if you want to save your marriage get into couples therapy asap. Either you've got the right of it, and her new friend has some how swayed her to be discontented with you, or she's always secretly felt that way and her friend has emboldened her to speak out. Either way, therapy will help you both get to the bottom of it and hopefully save your marriage or at least let you separate amicably.", "NTA\n\nWtf is with your wife? She expects you to work all day and do ALL the house chores and take care of the kids? While she uses your money to pamper herself?\n\nHer priorities are so wrong on so many levels.\n\nShe lucky she ain't my wife. With that attitude and disrespect I would have agreed to divorce and said I'll see you in court.", "NTA. It sounds like you tried for months to discuss the issue with your wife reasonably and come to a fair compromise, without success. Her demands that you take on more and more responsibility, accusations that you were lazy or not doing enough, and manipulative threats were unacceptable.", "NTA but why are you with her she seems to think you are just there to service her and do everything. What are you getting out of this marriage?", "NTA but what is your wife doing, its time to sit down and write a list of the hours of contribution you both put in, because there is a discrepancy.\n\nYou then need to address that there was never a problem until her \"friend\" came along.\n\nBeing a SAHM means you she works around the house and does the child care, which is interesting as they are in school.", "Nta clearly your wife is impossible to please and seems to be using you so she can be lazy tbh", "NTA. Perhaps call her bluff the next time she uses the D word. \n\nYou\u2019ve not got a winner there. \n\nHow draining can one spouse be, I\u2019m not even married to her and I want to divorce her", "NTA \nBut maybe you need to look closer at that D word if she keeps at this", "Nta, you\u2019re wife is being the \u201ca-word\u201d in this instance and seems to be taking advantage of your desire to make her happy", "NTA. If anything, she should pick up the lion's share of the household work because she's a SAHM. I don't know what that friend did to her, but she's clearly no longer the \"angel of a woman\" you once knew. You need to sit her down and have a very serious conversation about the responsibilities you each have before the situation gets even worse.", "NTA. She is supposed to be your wife and partner, not another child to raise. Honestly, she sounds exhausting.", "NTA- She can\u2019t have her cake and eat it too. \n\nTo be honest, when she started threatening Divorce, I would have gotten a consultation immediately with an attorney. \n\nI probably wouldn\u2019t even attempt therapy considering that you\u2019ve responded to her wants of cutting back hours and taking on more and when you asked her to pitch in for her financial luxuries, she\u2019s responded by again crying \u201cWolf!\u201d\n\nHer friend has convinced her that she doesn\u2019t want to be a mom. She wants to be a woman with no responsibilities.", "NTA\nWhat a brilliant plan. I know she's upset, but you made your point. Hopefully,  she appreciates what she has and apologizes for her misogynistic views!", "Nta if it isn\u2019t obvious. Just to say, I WISH I could scoop you up and marry you, my partner isn\u2019t much of a partner, he does the very bare minimum as a parent and not even that, and does NOTHING for the house, meals or anything. My kids would be malnourished from eating cereal all day everyday if it weren\u2019t for me. He does work.", "Can we be frank, what does she actually bring to the table for this relationship? She doesn't want to do a lick of housework and she doesn't want to do any work outside of the house? Does she believe she's entitled to doing nothing for the rest of her life by piggybacking on all of your effort and labor because you're a man?\n\nI think this calls for couple's therapy so you can lay out your very valid issues with this unhealthy dynamic on the table for a professional to evaluate with both of you. Otherwise I doubt your relationship is going to make it through her tormenting you with threats and insulting you in front of others no matter how much you bend over backwards for her. \n\nNTA but in a way you are an AH to yourself for wearing such thick rose tinted lenses while this seems to have already verged into abusive territory from her for quite some time now. Ask yourself what kind of love from your partner you deserve, and if you're genuinely getting that from her?", "NTA. She got exactly what she wanted. You are doing more work at home instead of at work. Hope she sees the light.", "NTA you are doing what she asked you to do. I think if she\u2019s willing to have a real conversation things would change.", "NTA Your wife doesn't want to face the natural results. There's always a balance between working at a paying job and working on home and family, and you illustrated that very well. It was not financial abuse. But for her to threaten divorce, that's manipulation.", "NTA. As a SAHM she should do most of the chores, if not all, because being a SAHM is a job in itself. I\u2019m not saying you should not do a part and you obviously are doing it, but if she wants a stay at home dad, she needs to go out and get herself a job that pays.", "NTA.", "100% NTA , I would look into how much alimony she would be getting if she does divorce and do whatever you can to lower that amount. Maybe her getting a part time job I don't really know", "I suggest either the friend goes or you go and since she's so keen on throwing around the divorce word, I'd say it and mean it!!", "NTA\n\nI think you\u2019re being a push over though.  Had I been in your situation I wouldn\u2019t even entertain her any longer.  My first question would\u2019ve been \u201cwhat exactly will you be bringing to the family table if I\u2019m working and doing all the chores?\u201d", "NTA. But your wife sure is.  Does she actually do anything at all around the house?   Next time she threatens divorce, just say sure, start the process.  I'm sorry but she sounds like a lazy AH who just wants you to foot the bill for her life.", "NTA your wife is immature and manipulative. Stop blaming her friend for her words and choices. She chooses to threaten divorce and wants her cake and eat it. She wants her nails done She can get a job. Being stay at home you do all the shit at home. She's no angel and she not a good wife or person. \n\nCall her bluff and next time she threatens divorce just say OK I think your right. Watch her backtrack so fast you get whiplash.", "This woman has you totally conned. If she doesn't want to have a job and instead be a SAHM then the job is to (largely) take care of the house and the kids. \n\nAt the very least you need therapy and to reassign responsibilities around the house. Or reconsider this relationship. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nContributions to the household (including children) can be financial and/or labour. Generally both. Of course if you're contributing fiancially you'll be doing less labour, but it sounds like it was fairly equitable. \n\nThe fact she was bragging about wearing you down is awful but the way you went about approaching it was good. It sounds like something fundemental has changed in the relationship though and with her values and expectations and if they're not aligned soon it's not going to get better.", "NTA but why are you two married?  She sounds horrible, and her friends suck.", "Clearly nta, what did she expect? Doing nothing all day? She doesn\u2019t fulfill her part of the deal\u2026either be a sahm and do housework or go to work and provide the money", "NTA. Have you talked to her directly to ask why her feelings seemed to have changed? I assume she's getting some sort of validation from the new friend so perhaps she's unhappy and is blaming you rather than looking for aolutions, as that often seems like the easier path. You've made your point, now maybe it's time to talk.", "So what exactly is your wife doing in this relationship? \nSeems like you get used for Lifestyle from the Information we get here...", "INFO: sorry but did you have any bad experience in the past to deem your wife to be an \u2018angel\u2019?? She is as much of a misandrist as her friend, maybe even more. Have you considered that you are being abused financially and emotionally by her? Please reflect and get some couple\u2019s therapy.", "100% NTA", "[deleted]", "NTA jeez what kind of angel is this? a fallen one?", "NTA and I salute you!", "\"even claimed it was financial \"a-word\"\"?\n\nThe hell is the a-word? Financial ass?", "NTA.", "While your frustration is understandable, ESH (Everyone Sucks Here). Your wife for not acknowledging your contributions and using the \"D\" word manipulatively, and you for cutting back on work and taking over all chores without discussing it with her first. Open communication and setting expectations together is important in any relationship. It's crucial to sit down and have a calm, open conversation about your needs and expectations, and come to a fair agreement about chores and responsibilities that works for both of you.", "ESH. I\u2019ll start with why YTA first\n\n1. You accused your wife of being manipulative but instead of communicating with her and negotiating about cutting back shifts, etc. you cut back to teach her a lesson. Pot calling the kettle black.\n\n2. You\u2019re blaming some random friend of your wife as if your wife doesn\u2019t have the agency to make her own choices. That third person has nothing to do with the choices your wife makes. \n\nYour wife is also an AH. Because both of you are so bad at communicating compassionately with each other, you are both the architects of your own unhappiness. You and your wife need to go to therapy and work out these fixable miscommunications. Why waste any more of your lives frustrated with each other?", "ESH ya'll need to stop playing games with each other and learn to talk to each other.", "You could try coming at this from a \"female\" perspective and buy the Fair Play system. It was designed by a disgruntled housewife trying to figure out how to show her husband that he wasn't actively participating in maintaining house (house and life).\n\nShe ended up creating a well designed system meant to equitably and functionality divide all the tasks that make life happen. I really believe in this tool and I think it would help you (and your wife) figure out some stuff.\n\nI think you're NTA, but being \"right\" doesn't solve your problem. Plus if she's getting pushback from her friend, and since reddit is kind of seen as a man-space, idk if having this verdict will be helpful at all. Give you piece of mind maybe, but you're still stuck in this situation where you haven't been shown how to succeed (or if you can).", ">I never said anything about her childishness or her very radical misandry\n\nINFO: please elaborate on what you consider childishness and very radical misandry? It would inform a lot whether we're talking about like \"chopping off the balls works great for dogs,\" or whether she's like an abuse counselor? Because it sounds like you relate this new friend to your wife bringing up divorce and financial abuse, which are specific terms. On that note, why did you call divorce the d-word? That's...fascinating", "Would love to hear her side of this lol", "ESH. I will never understand how people devote so much time and energy to avoiding hard conversations.", "Overall, NTA but yeah, what you did was just as manipulative as her using the D word in my opinion thought she's still worse overall considering she's not doing anything but still expects everything and you did try to address what you were feeling with her treatment of you.\n\nI don't know man, I can't say I know what you're going through but if my wife were to pull this kind of stuff, I'd probably be thinking of either getting a ton a help if I could afford it or take her up on her original offer.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would chat with him while he worked or check on him if he needed anything (water etc). He told me that his wife was a SAHM too and he worked 12/14 hr days and six days a week. He also told me that his wife didn't do much cooking. Well she did cook, just not for him. She cooked for herself and the kids. He usually went home and ate a can of beef stew or chili. Sometimes he didn't even warm that up because he was so tired. I was horrified. I asked him what he brought for lunch, he said he didn't bring anything and that he was ok. I was even more horrified.
