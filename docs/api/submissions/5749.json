I didn't grow up poor but money was always tight. As for Beth getting a 200+ wedding, it's her mother's money and dream. Apparently, her mom saved up money just for a grand wedding. Coming to Bill, there were times he covered my rent when I didn't want to dip into my savings or ask my parents for a loan. I paid back at my own convenience. He never pressured me. Most people are rarely black and white, and I never had anything against him till this incident. So, yeah, when he asked to share the condo, I gladly agreed as it not only helped him but also gave me an excuse to not ask V to move in with me.\n\nI talked to Bill and from what I gathered it all started when he visited Beth's house. They had a small group, got drunk and played, what reddit like to put it as, fuck around and find out. One of the stupid questions was, 'who's the most beautiful/hottest person you've met? Partners and celebs excluded.' Since Beth already answered, Bill answered 'V'. Well, you read about the fallout. He apologized to me and V for being a dick, his words not mine. Beth too called and apologized to V. Something else triggered her, not just Bill's answer, and she will be restarting therapy soon. They are extending the lease on our old house and they will move in together. So, both of us decided to give them a second chance.\n\nAs for V, I guess she's the total package. Beauty and the brains. Consider it a flex, I don't care. I accidently saw her pay slip once, and she makes almost ten times more than me. Though V is not the kind to lord it over others, it's still a little embarrassing. The matter of finances rarely came up till now, but moving in together means we need to have that discussion. So it held me back a little, but no more. I finally asked her move in with me and she agreed. At least something positive came out of this mess.\n\nLet me end this by saying happy holidays everyone.", "created_utc": 1672114908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zw6fq2/update_aita_for_kicking_my_roommates_fianc\u00e9_out/", "score": 230, "replies": ["i\u2019m so glad to hear it! i love updates when they turn out like this \ud83e\udd70.

Did they apologise for that? It\u2019s pretty gross behaviour.", "I undertand keeping contact to her but... She wasn't being jealous and bitter. She was being racist. I could never forgive.", "I would highly recommend you go talk to a therapist or a counsellor about why it matters that V makes more than you before you allow that resentment to destroy your relationship.", "It's refreshing to see a nice mature update. I wish more people had their head screwed on like OP", "I wouldn't forgive her for that behavior lol. She is a racist and if she ever gets mad at V it will slip out again.

Leaving out celebs and partners is asking for problems.", "Forgive but never forget.  The next \u201cthey\u201d comment, I would take a couple steps back from both of them"]}
