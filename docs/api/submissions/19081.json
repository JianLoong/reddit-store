Also, if she really does want to become vegan, it should be on her to make sure what she eats is free of animal products. It's not like you lied, she simply grabbed something without making sure it was safe for her to eat. That's really not on you in my opinion. I really don't understand everyone saying you're the asshole. While it might have sounded harsh, telling her that if she doesn't trust you she can cook for herself is fair. I mean, what other solution is there? Either she trusts you or she doesn't.\n\nOne thing I might consider is using the money you would have spent on her portion of meat (because meat is expensive), and instead giving that to her to be able to buy vegan options for herself.

When it cools down the water will be thick. That's an easy egg substitute, can even be whipped if I'm not wrong. (Don't know how expensive flaxseed is where you live, but it's an option.) Also, you can grind the leftover seeds to sneak extra fiber into meals. \n\n- If you use canned garbanzo beans the water can also be whipped into an egg substitute, it's called aquafaba (might be wrong about the name)\n\nAsk your daughter AND SON to participate in the planning and execution.

Conveniently, your son can just dodge carbs and eat everything else you're cooking, but you lost some credibility when you stated that you specially made some keto bread for your son, but can't go even slightly out of the way toasting it in a way your daughter can partake in it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I'm a little dumb, and just pieced together that your daughter is all upset about being tricked into eating pig, but isn't upset that she chose to eat eggs.

Not only do you not understand that cross-contamination is a huge problem for Vegan people, but it is unbelievably easy to fund a vegan diet nowadays with the low price of so many protein sources. Also, B-12 supplements are only like $20 every two months for the good brand, so you're just being vindictive at that point. She believes in Veganism and wants to eat a Vegan diet, something that is very attainable and only seems like it costs a lot.\n\nAll that being said, your daughter needs to learn how to prepare her own food, that is true. She needs to start researching and working on meals that she can prep for herself and work with you on discussions of grocery purchasing and what she needs. This is an incredibly good opportunity for the two of you that I highly recommend that you pounce on. Go online and do some research on \"cheap vegan recipes\" witha  quick google search and you will find a TON of things out there. Pick out like 10 of them and put them forward for her to look at and choose like 3 that the two of you are going to go out to the store, buy the ingredients for, and do the full process of making this meal together with your guidance. If she wants to live this lifestyle and you don't want to make 2 different meals for your family, then you have to take a hands on approach as her parent to help her succeed. Your kids are not something you get to mold however you want and avoid them coming into themselves. They're people who will throw curveballs at you all the time and it is your job to go with the flow and help them become the best version of THEMselves that they can be. Right now, you sound like a person who doesn't like her decision and doesn't want to help them do it right or safely because it inconveniences you. Well, guess what, you're the one who chose to have kids. This is what it's like. Your only option is to grow up and deal with it responsibly because it's not like you can just press undo on a teenager.\n\nMeanwhile, the extra way you're kind of an asshole is you act like your sons keto diet is so much easier, but if he's eating the normal meal you put forward but without the carbs, you're actually underfeeding him. Have you gone into deeper research with your son on keto? Is he on this via nutritionist recommendation? Keto can be very harmful and damaging if not done correctly and overseen by a nutritionist. Please go to a doctor with him to discuss this if you have not already because putting your body into ketosis isn't anything to be casual about.", "NTA.
