You have stayed you don\u2019t know what her disabilities are (though in description, I would suggest at the very least, that she\u2019s on the spectrum). That aside, it\u2019s absolutely plausible that she needs to use a rolling box because carrying a backpack causes discomfort or pain in regards to her disability. \n\nIf she is on the spectrum, I would guess that she has not had much guiding and experience in social settings, and does not know how to talk to others.

Emotions are good; human beings have emotions. The mark of an adult is learning to feel your emotions and not be controlled by them. In this case, you were overcome, and your emotions got the better of you. You were harsh in how you spoke. Her behavior should not have the power to dictate yours, so knowing that you let her get to you one time means that she shouldn't have the power to get to you again.

People are forgetting that everyone has a breaking point. After being mistreated for so long it only makes sense that you would have snapped eventually. Good on you for sticking up for yourself.

Seems like comparing your disabilities is because she has an inferiority complex or something. She is trying to make your life harder for what ? It is completely unjust that she makes it less comfortable for you. Wear your hoodie everyday proudly please. \nYou could have handled the situation better but you are NTA, you are only 16 so just take it as a life lesson to stick up for yourself before it escalate to the point where you have rage bottled up for years to go out in one moment.

She literally admitted to wanting the accessible seat not because of whatever disability she may have, but because of this box.
