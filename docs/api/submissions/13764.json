You have stayed you don\u2019t know what her disabilities are (though in description, I would suggest at the very least, that she\u2019s on the spectrum). That aside, it\u2019s absolutely plausible that she needs to use a rolling box because carrying a backpack causes discomfort or pain in regards to her disability. \n\nIf she is on the spectrum, I would guess that she has not had much guiding and experience in social settings, and does not know how to talk to others.

Emotions are good; human beings have emotions. The mark of an adult is learning to feel your emotions and not be controlled by them. In this case, you were overcome, and your emotions got the better of you. You were harsh in how you spoke. Her behavior should not have the power to dictate yours, so knowing that you let her get to you one time means that she shouldn't have the power to get to you again.

Do not comment on them again.\n- Stop trying to compete with me over who needs what accommodations more. I am entitled to use this desk, if you need one as well talk to the teacher.\n- Your box is none of my business and not my concern, you should talk to the teacher.\n- What I wear is none of your business, I am starting to feel harassed by you.\n\nAlternatively, if there are not enough accessible desks or equipment for two people who need them at once, it might be possible for you to switch out of any classes with her to avoid her taking equipment you **need.** Or you can demand the administrators put in enough accessible equipment for both of you because she is trying to push you aside.\n\nHonestly, if I were you, I would aim to my schedule completely away from her if possible.", "NTA, she really sounds like one though.", "NTA.

Earlier I naively used to believe that I would always dodge obnoxious people by avoiding them as much as possible. Well, there was always someone. But it's easier said than done. Till date I haven't figured out how to conduct myself when someone pushes all my buttons. I do end up yelling and cussing. And even though the other person was the bully to begin with, it looks as though I am in the wrong. In reality I got agitated when provoked. So intellectually I know that I need to respond differently. But I don't know how to implement this. Maybe you could discuss your response options with someone wiser and more experienced.", "Nta.

That is SO unrealistic. As I said above, few bullies are stupid enough to bully kids in class. Most bullying happens not in the classroom but in the hallways and restrooms. And it's often not loud; it's quiet. The exception might be during passing periods when the teacher is not in the room or has students who have questions or need help. \n\nI don't know what Box Girl's disabilities are, but I'd bet money she's not making her obnoxious remarks within earshot of any teachers or paras. I hope the OP's parents raise the issues with Box Girl with administrators and special ed staff.

Even if she was just carrying the backpack by a handle/it's straps, that would dislocate her shoulder still. \n\nTheoretically if this was the case, you get your class material/the stuff you need out of said box and put it to the side of the classroom. You do not take seats that make physically impaired people's lives easier. She does not need that seat to make it easier for her to get up and store any mobility aids.

Let's be real, she is selfish and doesn't have other people in mind.", "And literally none of that is related to gender.", "So if I didn't read so many AITA posts I would whole heartedly agree with you because for me personally gender never comes into play with my personal vote, it's just not a factor I even think of. With that said I really do see the bias this sub has, it could be two basically identical posts just with the genders reversed and you get wildly different responses and the only thing that can be attributed to is that it's a man doing something to a woman or vice versa. I haven't read all the other comments yet to really know if the ESH votes are valid or not but for me personally, I don't see how they could be, even if the girl has an invisible disability it doesn't give her a right to claim her's is worse than anyone else's. In my opinion people that use their disabilities, no matter how real, severe, or visible they are, to put others down or to get more special attention/help than they truly need are AHs in my book. \n\nI will go continue to read the comments and if I find that I can possibly agree with the ESH votes I will come edit this comment to say so but after 5 years of this girl using her disability to bully other people with disabilities I cannot imagine I will be able to agree unless the person in question personally comes and disputes OP's version of the story themselves.\n\nEdit: Okay I have gone through and read the ESH votes and I still cannot for the life of me agree with them. All of them are expecting a 16yo, physically disabled, neurodivergent KID to be the bigger person or go to an adult (which from his comments he has and plans to do more of) about a person that has been bullying him (and others from OP's perspective) for at least 5 years. The ESH vote makes absolutely no sense to me no matter how I look at it and I kinda pride myself on being able to empathize/put myself in others shoes but with the information we have I can only be on OP's side and say he is NTA.\n\n Now I do agree with you that this isn't a post that is actually bias based on gender, to me it seems like the people voting ESH are either projecting or have seriously impaired reading comprehension. We only have OP's side to judge and I personally stick to that when I make my judgement on these posts, I do take into account that there is at least one other side to the matter but even trying to empathize with the girl from the story using the views of the people that voted ESH still makes her the AH in this situation. She is the one that has continuously made their disabilities a competition. While it is absolutely her choice to share what her disability is I can't help but think if she really wanted consideration/validation or more accomodations she wouldn't be secretive about her actual disability. \n\nMy main point is that OP and this girl are kids and I can fully understand him blowing up after taking her BS for so long but I can't understand how/why anyone would be vindictive towards someone they should be able to relate to...", "This is exactly it. I have an invisible disability that causes my arms to randomly go numb from the elbow or shoulder down (depending on what joint is deciding to act up that day). Sometimes it\u2019s one side, sometimes it\u2019s both. Some days I have to wear braces but other times I can get away with just wearing them at night. I have a different disorder that causes my fingers to sometimes dislocate (especially my thumbs) and my shoulders to subluxate (semi-dislocate) so basically sometimes my arms just suck. \n\nBut I can still fucking walk unassisted and sit my ass in a normal chair. If I needed a rolling box to carry my backpack and be near me I can think of multiple places I could put it in literally any single one of the high school classrooms I had that wouldn\u2019t involve me taking an accessible chair (the ONLY accessible chair) for myself.", "To be fair, there's a difference between carrying a backpack for a few minutes and having to pick it up and carry it every forty minutes for 6-7 hours. He shouldn't have said that. Also, the gender bias in this forum has a lot more to do with relationship shit. I really don't think it has anything to do with this situation. A lot of people are sensitive to invisible disabilities because of all the stories of assholes giving them shit over things like using the bigger bathroom stall.\n\nThat said, that's more of a \"dude, don't say shit like that\" thing than an ESH imo. She's the asshole. She belittles *his* disability *constantly*. It's difficult to sympathize with her running out peacocking tears because he said something similar.\n\nSometimes, we're human.
