You shouldn\u2019t have to fight everyone who feels entitled to the accessible everything\u2014 that\u2019s why  parking permits and IEPs exist. \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to evaluate how much she needs that box\u2014 it should be on her IEP if she needs it and then the teacher has to make sure she gets it. And your accessible desk should be on your IEP and your teacher needs to make sure you get it. \n\nSo \u201csorry but it\u2019s on my IEP, you\u2019ll need to show the teacher your IEP to get the furniture you need\u201d is the best response, but I understand that when you\u2019re left to sort this yourself why you weren\u2019t so polite.", "NTA. Did anyone see where OP said the girl said \"hers are worse\" in terms of disabilities and complains about his accommodations all the time? If that happened for 5 years to anyone they'd snap. Anyone saying E S H is not really sympathizing with you in my opinion OP, as one blowup in 5 years is not really an AH kind of thing.", "NTA. She\u2019s being incredibly selfish", "NTA the ESH don\u2019t make sense. \u201cOut of proportion\u201d how the hell was your reaction out of proportion when you\u2019ve been dealing with this for 5 years? And she is the one who provoked your outburst in the first place so being yelled at in public is on her. NTA NTA NTA", "NTA - I am sorry - I laughed so hard at \u2018the backpack she kept in that goddamn box\u2019. Hopefully she leaves you alone now.", "\u201cShe bullied you for 5 years but you lashed out 1 time so I think everyone su-\u201c I hate this subreddit man idk why I come here. NTA", "Nta. Being disabled doesn't give someone a free pass to be rude and annoying to you for the last 5 years. This one out burst is understandable because of issues listed. However you need to speak to the administrative team and sort this out. Get your parents there to help advocate for you. You need to sort this out because another out burst isn't appropriate nor will it help resolve anything.", "NTA what ever else she have actual options where you do not.\n\nAnd she was just plain rude.\n\nSpeaking as someone with disabilities and autism, and knowing lots of other with them, she Does sound like she\u2019s playing everything way up and milking it for everything she can.", "Well,  NTA, but you didn't go about it the right way, either. Bottling it up until you blow isn't your best option. You, and hopefully your peers, need to start calling her out when she pulls her crap. No yelling or screaming, maybe just telling her that if she can't be respectful, you won't be talking to her anymore.", "NTA, no one else was dealing with her the right way. She sounds entitled", "NTA, this was building up for a long time and it makes sense to snap/lash out when you finally have had too much. \n\nI do think some of what you said may have been a bit unnecessarily harsh, but she also had you in tears. I can\u2019t negatively judge you for your reaction to a mounted pile of her actions that led you here. She\u2019s more in the wrong.", "NTA, do make a list of things she has said to you and the threats to take your seat away from you.  What she is doing is bullying you.  Report it to the school.  Keep a journal of what she does and says.  If your friends have witnessed this have them report it as well.", "NTA. She really sounds like she has BPD or histrionic personality disorder. It\u2019s not on you to make a bully feel better and she was crying because someone finally saw through her shit.", "NTA  \n\n\nWhen you see her and her stupid rolling box again, say the same thing again.", "ESH \nnot all disabilities are visible, I had a school mate in middle school issuing a carry on. She seemed the image of health beautiful tall athletic girl. Now at 30 she is wheelchair 100%, never knew she had a huge deformation of her spine that with time was just bound to get worst. \nYou should both be understanding of each other, yet here you are complaining of who got it worst and who is faking.", "ESH - you treated her like garbage in a public setting. It\u2019s fine that you dislike her and her personality. It is not ok to scream at people because you don\u2019t like their personality. \n\nAs far as disabilities go, I am sure you are aware that not all disabilities are visible, and that includes mobility. Being able to walk does not mean she is capable of carrying a heavy backpack all day. \n\nOne comparison I saw recently was in regards to a person complaining that someone who can walk uses a wheelchair, and when he posed the question to the wheelchair user in a AHA! moment, she replied with a question- why do you use a car if you have working legs? His answer- because I can\u2019t walk everywhere. \n\nIt\u2019s the same with all sorts of disabilities. You have stayed you don\u2019t know what her disabilities are (though in description, I would suggest at the very least, that she\u2019s on the spectrum). That aside, it\u2019s absolutely plausible that she needs to use a rolling box because carrying a backpack causes discomfort or pain in regards to her disability. \n\nIf she is on the spectrum, I would guess that she has not had much guiding and experience in social settings, and does not know how to talk to others. But I think you understand that a bit as well, as that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve shown of yourself.", "ESH \n\nShe got angry at you so you lashed out at her. \n\nGo talk to the head of the school and ask if they can accommodate both of you by getting another seat so you two don't have to fight over it.", "ESH. She doesn't sound pleasant but equally, you exploded  and said some pretty nasty things. You really need to raise it with people who are in a position to do something.", "As a disabled person myself, I think this is ESH. You shouldn't have screamed at her, but I think you may have misdirected your anger. You should really be angry at the head of the school as it is fairly clear that they are not providing both of you the necessary accommodations for both of you.", "ESH.\n\nIt's not disability olympics. Everyone has different needs.  (Though, imho, it sounds like your need for the chair is more so than hers...) But your blowing up at her was out of proportion.\n\nTake it up to the school that that particular classroom needs another accessible seat.", "ESH\u2026 I just think it\u2019s a case of her being really annoying and selfish and you just had enough in that moment. Ideally you could have spoken to a Teacher about this earlier like when she made a comment about your headphones etc. You should apologise to her and try to set boundaries.", "NTA OP.  She sounds selfish, entitled, and arrogant.", "YTA\nJust because someone can carry a backpack for a short amount of time,it doesn't mean that they are able to do so on a consistent basis,  without injury or cumulative negative impact. \nWith ME/CFS I would have anticipated that you would be more understanding of fluctuating,  variable and invisible conditions.\n\nAlso, nobody should EVER required to disclose a medical diagnosis to you (or anyone unless it is a safety issue) to allow them to use adaptations. \n\nShe sucks a little bit for the comment about getting there first, bit it's hard to judge tone from your post.\n\nDisability isn't a competition. Sadly sometimes there aren't enough accessible provisions & we have to make do. But that should lead us to fight for moe provisions for all - not turn on each other.\n\nYours sincerely, an apparently able bodied person with an invisible disability, who has used use a pull along box for access reasons.", "ESH.  \nShe's entitled, but you were flat out nasty to her too. You both could do with apologizing to each other.", "ESH, not all disabilities are visible, as autistic you should know it. Yes she sounds unpleasant to deal with but it still doesen't excuse to lashing out. If you have problem with her being obstacle to your movement in classes try to talk to teachers, maybe they would find a way how to change your classes so you two would not bump into each other so often.", "You are both assholes.", "Saying hurtful things because you're angry is classic asshole behavior. YTA.", "ESH- that was far more dramatic than it needed to be. You can stand up to her without the personal insults. true or not. This person should have been confronted a long time ago.", "YTA\n\nYou owe her an apology in front of everyone.  \n\nIt's okay to not to like someone.   It's not okay to scream all of your hatred at them in public.   \n\nYou were out of control and incredibly mean. \n\nYou will learn that there are millions of jerks like that in this world and you can't scream at them all.   You're better off learning how to cope with people your don't like rather than vomiting out your hate on them.  \n\nTry meditation to help you calm yourself.", "Dear Redditors, please help ... how can I stop seeing shite posts from children???", "There are many irrelevant points in this post.    Which makes it a bit convoluted.   The box is messy.  so?    She said it's not fair you  wear headphones.    \n\nThere is one accessible seat in class and she needs it for her box?   Why can't the school provide 2 accessible seats.    Why are you so mad that she has a rolling box?\n\nESH", "Ok, so where was the teacher when you had this blow up? Why haven\u2019t either you or the girl asked for a second accessible seat in the class? Why haven\u2019t you talked with school staff about some of your concerns? Why did you think the girl commenting on sitting in that seat was such a horrible thing that you needed to say vile things to her in public? Why do you think you have the right to know what disabilities she has? ESH, including the teachers/staff who should be more aware of the needs of the multiple disabled students in class.", "ESH, just because you have a physical, visible disability doesn\u2019t mean you have a \u201cworse\u201d disability than she does, especially considering you don\u2019t know what her disability actually is. It isn\u2019t a competition, and screaming that you hate her is OTT. If she\u2019s bothering you, the correct answer is to speak to admin about removing yourself from classes she is also in.", "ESH. As a disabled person, you suck for how you handled it and for judgmental thinking. You don't know her disability so you can't say what she does or doesn't need or what she can or can't do. She sucks for always playing the Disabled Olympics game against you.", "ESH. Go to your school counselor and advise that this girl is making comments about taking the disabled seating in your class. The counselor will sort it out for you. Yelling is inappropriate, regardless of how much you hate her.", "OP,  YTA; however, you are not an adult and you can learn to better handle situations like this in the future. This girl picked at you for 5 years and that is 5 years too long.  If you were not sure how to handle her comments, the school should have had support available for you at school - counselor or teacher - so that you did not have to put up with her smart mouth for 5 tears before exploding. As for the rolling box, it is not your call as to whether or not she needs that box.  Mind your own business. When she attempted to compare disabilities or make comments about your headphones, you should have been able to tell her to mind her own business and leave you alone.  Teachers should have supported you.", "YTA. You don't know her disabilities. Shut up", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
