Maybe you can use the word rose in that language.\n\nThe thing about naming a baby is it's not just about you, even if you had a name picked out for years. Your husband needs to be taken into account, too. Something that makes you both happy is going to be a far better name in the long run.", "How old is step daughter?", "What if you used something like Rosalie or Rosemary as the middle name?", "Yes, there's many potential options here. I don't get how the middle name is the only possible way to honor her.", "They'll have the same middle name, which isn't usual (in the US) for siblings and half-siblings.", "How about using your grandmas first name? I understand your reasoning but this sounds like it\u2019ll cause a lot of drama, hurt for your step daughter and possibly damage your family as a whole.", "So in your family, is there a tradition of parents using the same middle name for multiple kids? If so, then ignore me. If not, be aware that others might take your husband's decision to use the same middle name for multiple kids as a dig at earlier kids.", "But it was also stepdaughters grandmothers name right?", "Just give her the middle name Rose and don\u2019t volunteer the information unless someone asks. If they do, just say \u201cher middle is Rose, after her great grandmother.\u201d\n\nMost people really don\u2019t care about middle names and don\u2019t have the same attachment to them as they do their first name. I\u2019m not even sure my partner of 10 years knows my middle name, lol.", "No, it's just a middle name - use whatever name you want. A lot of families have different members with the same middle name, it's not a big deal. How old is the other daughter anyway? Regardless of her age, she doesn't get to call the shots; it would, however, determine how you discuss this decision with her.", "\u2026yeah. I saw the edit after I posted my comment.", "My Mom is also a stepmom to two of my brothers, bio Mom to two, they still all have the same middle name because it's a family one on their Dad's side! I don't think you should have to back down on the naming, if it was a smaller issue then sure sometimes you have to take the high road, but this is a name your child will be carrying for life and it's really special to you. It sounds like her Mom is determined to fight you all the way no matter what you do, and I think giving in to that will make her feel like she's won something - if in turn that makes you feel like you've *lost* something, that isn't ok. \n\nYou do you Mama, if backing down will help you keep your peace and you can be ok with that, you make whatever choice is best for you. But sometimes people are going to judge you either way and you can put yourself first.", "Even as a friend do you think she'd want to share her name with her sister who, I'm guessing here, is also going to get more time with their father. Who is, also guessing here, losing the role the role of only child or only daughter.", "I would think it would be hard for a child getting a younger sibling to adjust to everything and share a middle name.

If she's just making unreasonable requests then no, but not wanting to share a name with your sibling is not unreasonable.", "Holy shit, step-parents are terrifying. Yes. If you're not willing to live your life considering someone else don't marry their parent while they're a minor. My god.\n\nDoes your husband know you feel this way? If so, shame on him.", "I mean, yes? That\u2019s what being a parent is: sacrificing for their betterment and happiness. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a small thing like you hate a book that your stepdaughter wants read to her at night. In that case, fine, you choose another book. This is an identity your stepdaughter already has, and the implication (since you\u2019re saying you know she\u2019ll be upset) is that you\u2019re trying to replace her with your new daughter. \n\nIt seems like you see her as other - your stepdaughter, not your family - but she has an equal share in the family as your other children because *she is your husband\u2019s child*. \n\nIf the situation was reversed with the ex giving her next child your first daughter\u2019s name (with the same tradition-passed-down reasoning and middle name placement), would you think your daughter\u2019s feelings or the ex\u2019s matter more? Would her complaint that she shouldn\u2019t \u201chave to live life to please someone else\u201d be adequate to you?", "She's a child, so yeah. You chose to be in a relationship with a man with children. I just will put my story down, my daughter has a great stepmum. I've often told her how I'm happy that she loves my daughter so much. But, she is from Wales (technically another country but not really) and she got pregnant, my ex moved there (seven hours away), and he told our daughter that it was a two bedroom apartment and she would be sharing with her new baby sister and it was their room. My daughter was very upset that he moved so far away. Nothing we can do about it. When she went there, my daughter is 13 by the way, she went into the bedroom. All over was stencils on the walls and wardrobes of the baby's name. My daughter's name was nowhere. None of her clothes or possessions were in the room, they were in box in the hall. Now, if he'd not told her it was her room, she could have maybe been OK, but she doesn't deserve to feel like second best (and I don't blame the stepmum, I blame my ex, because I don't think the stepmum knew what he had said). But I have to console my daughter and she feels upset, and when you make a life with someone who already has children, that means putting your own needs behind the child. If the child didn't care about the name, fine, go for it, but ask, and if it isn't OK, respect that.", "But if she doesn\u2019t want you to use it will you listen?", "\nShe\u2019s my step daughter, she\u2019s 4 and my daughter is 1.
