We've had a lot of fun today. But remember, if you are old enough to be drafted to die in a pointless war, you're probably fine to consume alcohol in moderation. That said? When you are ***demanding*** that someone else buys you alcohol, especially saying it like \"I want wine and vodka, and get a case of beer while your there,\" you're being an entitled asshole.

Plus you said no and he wouldn't stop hounding you, that's enough to not want to do anything for him.", "I rememeber being that age (21) and having younger friends constantly hounding me to buy them booze. \n\nNta. They didn't even ask, they just felt entitled to you buying them booze. If they're not mature enough to know how to make a respectful request, then I wouldn't buy them booze either. You're allowed to say no.", "NTA. You are being responsible, and they are pressuring you to break the law, potentially face criminal penalties, so they can get drunk. They are using you, and you are better off without them. I commend you for being responsible and mature.", "NTA.\n\nIt is illegal and you didn't feel comfortable breaking the rules. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\nThat's really risky for you, you can get in a lot of trouble... they can buy/get their alcohol form another person.  \n\nI too drank underage, at home, with my parents, so I learned how to stop drinking. Then I started drinking away, when allowed. Never put anyone in this kind of risk, and I was the younger in the most places. \n\nJust stay home and enjoy a nice quiet Christmas with GF and a glass of wine (or another drink of your choise)", "NTA.\n\nYou would be personally liable and potentially face charges for providing alcohol to underage drinkers.", "NTA. People always complain when there isn't alcohol at a party, wedding, etc. I drink and don't have an issue with it, but find it sad when people can't get through a simple function without it.", "NTA.\n\nYou\u2018re doing the right thing and your so-called friends shouldn\u2019t demand that you break the law for them!", "NTA a true friend wouldn\u2019t peer pressure someone into committing a crime.

You set a boundary that you weren\u2019t comfortable getting alcohol for them. They just need to accept that. Just because you are 21 doesn\u2019t make it your responsibility to get their alcohol.

Also, if one of them gets drunk at a party where OP provided alcohol, and then drives and has an accident, OP could face criminal charges for that too.", "USA has a pretty hard 21 limit.", "I know, so many things that could ruin OPs life in one fell swoop.
