I told him no problem I'd go and I wasn't even feeling like drinking much that night anyway, I actually like the bands on the bill too (all local), so I picked him up and we headed out.\n\nMy brother really enjoyed it and hung out with his old friends, I met one of them where we talked and my brother mentioned a fest I'm going to a month I'm constantly talking about. I showed him the roster. He was like \"Isn't Relient K a Christian band?\" I said yes although I didn't say that I'm Christian. He also noted other Christian bands on it too, a lot of old Tooth & Nail and Solid State bands, that's kind of the point of the fest. He was disapproving and then said \"I think Christians should be banned from fests.\" Yeah I wasn't happy and that seemed like a pretty tacky thing to actually tell someone in person but whatever, I still got into the next bands' sets.\n\nBefore the last band's set my brother asked me if I could drop off that guy too. I said sure as I hadn't drank anything...and on my phone I started compiling a playlist of the most Christian sounding Christian hardcore songs I could think. Really blatant ones from bands like Zao and Underoath that actually vocally mentioned Jesus and the like. Well after the show I gave him a ride and dropped him off and then went to drop my brother off and went home.\n\nThen today my brother texted me and said him and his friend were chatting yesterday and his friend was complaining about the songs I was playing. I laughed and replied explaining what he said earlier. My brother was still thankful about giving him a ride but his messages later seemed a bit annoyed and like I embarrassed him a bit too. I told him driver picks music and I didn't have to drop that guy off and was doing him a favor so he shouldn't complain.
