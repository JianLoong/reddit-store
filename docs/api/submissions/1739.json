Obviously your husband is his first grandson and the step (or bil) came after that, whether he's older or not. Maybe the FIL told him directly? idk.\n\nTbh I don't know why your best friend and BIL had that expectation to have it, unless he was told he will be getting it. If this affects your relationship then that's sad on their part. Yikes!\n\nNTA and I don't even think your husband is either. What i do think is grandfather needs to sit BIL down and explain why he wants it to go to your husband.

Your married, therfore a team, a united front. \n\n\nI'm guessing your FIL had your husband as his son first, seeing as you have stated your BIL was 11yrs old when adopted.  So your husband was the only and oldest for his first years until BIL came to the family. (You never stated the age difference). This means he's entitled to have the necklace, sorry. Regardless of who's older, your husband has been in the family longest and is still technically the oldest son. Adoption is only a formality of law, not genetics. And most times it comes down to blood, not law of adoption.  \n\nQuestion is who do you love most, your husband who you took vows with or a best friend? Are you willing to lose a marriage over something you really have no control over? I can't see the elders changing their minds over who will receive it just because you say so. Tbh, its not your decision because its not your tradition.", "Drama is happening regardless of accepting it or not.\n\n\nI'd accept it for my husband and not wear it .", "What a shitty situation. Technically, it should go to your friend considering the step- bother is older, but I can see how being \"adopted\" still causes a separation, which in itself is a big issue. Personally I think family heirlooms cause more issues than they're worth. But I digress. \n\n\\-NAH. \n\nYou have every right to reject it. However, you will always be seen as the AH from your husband and his family. It seems this family has deeper issues than just with this heirloom.", "NTa\n\nbut I can see why the grandfather wants it to go to you. \n\nHe wants the family heirloom to stay with blood family. If it's given to the others, it would be leaving the family.", "Nta.  But honestly it should go to you.  You are the biological sons wife.  And if it's a family heirloom it should be yours.", "How long has the stepson been the stepson?  My opinion the heirlooms should be kept in a biological family. If it goes to the stepson then it will be passed down to a completely different line.  I do think you are a jerk for not receiving the necklace.  Maybe the parents should buy a same value necklace for the stepson to begin on his side", "This right here, OP. Lock 'em all in a room until they sort themselves out and stop trying to put this on you and your friend/SIL. NTA\n\n(Who would want a piece of jewelry that causes so much family strife?? Cursed, indeed.)", "Any chance the necklace could be redesigned and turned into two necklaces?", "Definitely not over. It just would have opened up a different can of worms.", "This! Perfectly said.", "That\u2019s a very good point. Since the necklace is given *to the wife* then doesn\u2019t it belong to the husband\u2019s mother? Who does she want it to go to? Why is the FIL the one deciding?\n\nI\u2019m also wondering if OP\u2019s husband was born before or after the older son was adopted. If so, I can see an argument that OP\u2019s husband was a son to FIL first in time, and BIL became a son later, but if that\u2019s not the case then it seems even more like an AH move on FIL\u2019s part to be shunning his adoptive son in favor of his bio son. \n\nEither way OP is NTA", "I feel like it's not about an old trinket but the recognition of an adopted son being less than a blood son, which is horrible.", "He does call him dad and his bio dad isn't in the picture. He was 11 when he was adopted.", "FIL wanted to give it to his stepson though, it was FIL\u2019s father who insisted it go to OP.", "Not his stepson, his adopted son.", "Yeah I came to inquire about the specifics of the necklace. Then split it into 2 other sentimental items to be inclusive would be a potentially cool option. Or maybe just not pass it down yet and just loan it out for special events.

Then you both can have one and no one even needs to know which is the original.", "If the grandfather had already died Dad would have given the necklace to the SIL (adopted step-son's wife) and that would have changed it.", "I think that would add further drama that neither the SIL or OP want. I think the easiest way was just to reject it on principle and be done with the bullshit.", "My husband wouldn't be okay with that and it would cause even more problems.", "That doesn't mean she has to accept it. Weird comment.", "And technically, whoever wants can refuse and is NTA", "Oh yeah.

How horribly sad this attitude is for every adopted child.", "No, because then they can\u2019t play generational tug-of-war.", "Yeah. I feel like there is a missing element.

The other daughter-in-law being your best friend sure does muck things up. \n\nI have a brother who is technically a half-brother, who is technically my dad\u2019s step son. Everyone usually forgets it. My dad has dementia now and often talks about physical features my brother\u2019s kids got from him. It\u2019s super sweet and really shows how much my brother is my dad\u2019s son in my dad\u2019s eyes. \n\nThat said, before dementia, if we had any similar family heirlooms I\u2019m 100% my dad would have wanted me to get them. I also would feel a bit entitled to them. And I also recognize how unfair and shitty that would be to my brother.", "Ahh I misunderstood. He should just be happy he's living to see multiple great grandchildren. That is a rare thing!", "Really, did I say that the father wanted to give it to his stepson?", ">he has an older stepbrother", "She did reject it. She said she rejected it and they keep pressing.", "OP, what about your MIL? Your husband's mom? Is she stepbrother's mom? If not, what happened to her? And is that why your husband feels so strongly about the necklace. I kind of wonder if you are putting your best friend's feelings ahead of your husband's and the missing element is the difference in verdict for me", "Well...yeah. He's completely unreasonable. There isn't a way to appease completely unreasonable people. They are going to give you strife until you accept it. And then they will give you strife over something else. \n\nHonestly, I would melt it down, but do whatever you feel is right.", "No, it means she should because it\u2019s important to the family and as a member of the family it is best to show respect and support", "Oh, sorry, my bad, I thought they might actually want to stop the generational tug of war.\n\nSeriously, I totally get being left out of family heirloom stuff. I'm related to all the old-money families, the type of people who holiday at Providence and look down their nose at Cape Cod, but always through the sixth son who ran off with the maid and got disinherited.

So, there's that.", "I suppose if husbands mom had died I\u2019d reluctantly have to agree on OP being TA. OP seems to be saying no because she\u2019s empathetic and doesn\u2019t want to hurt BIL or SIL, but if it was something of her husband\u2019s mom\u2019s and it means a lot to husband that his mom\u2019s necklace be passed on to his wife, then OP would be the asshole to ignore that. I\u2019d sympathize because OP is in a no-win situation, though. \n\nThat was a good catch, it definitely makes a big difference.", "'Who his father adopted'", "this is very important to my point.  Often step parents will adopt their spouses child.   If this was a child adopted via other means, I think it's a lot different.", "Yes, I know. I was affirming OP's decision to reject it as the easiest way.", "Absolutely. Split the stones up, melt down the metal, and have two matching necklaces made.", "You again? No, she does not have to participate. Very simple, and it's shitty that they were fine to give the necklace to the BIL/SIL *until* they found out OP was pregnant.

Otherwise the adult men would solve their problems without involving their various spice.

After all, family traditions have to start somewhere. That should help smooth the ruffled feathers about the original necklace.\n\nAll this is really silly. The necklace is just an object.

In the end, it was your GFIL decision and you, along with other fam, decided it shouldn't be his decision. Was he mean to his stepson? Did he not treat him good? You didn't mention any issues so I'm assuming the GFIL has a good relationship with his stepgrandson and has treated him good. But having a family tradition that doesn't include a stepson is ok too. Its just a freaking necklace and in the end its the FIL's decision on who it should go to as that's how he sees HIS family tradition. You have officially killed the tradition. If I was the GFIL, I would tell everyone that he is no longer giving the necklace to any of you and he is dis-inheriting all of you so he can pay a lawyer to wait until there is a wife of a direct blood male descendant and can give it to her.

OP's husband is the first son, so it really should go to his wife. Some people hate that these traditions exist at all partly because of the drama and hurt they can cause, which I get, but based on the tradition, it should go to her. Can't blame her for not wanting to accept at all, but I also understand her husband being hurt and feeling like she is choosing her friend over him and his family. He may have felt quite hurt that the necklace was going to his stepbrother's wife in the first place since the lifelong expectation was probably that his wife would get it, and may have felt that he was being slighted when it was going to someone else. If that's the case, he is now feeling like everyone, including his wife, doesn't care that grandpa is the only one insisting he be given something promised to him.", "I feel like you're ignoring a lot of context here.

Also wouldn\u2019t OPs husbands mom have the necklace? Unless she\u2019s not around anymore. Anyways OP is NTA for not wanting to get involved but I think ultimately if it is in father in laws possession then it should be up to him to decide who gets the necklace. If he wanted the stepbrother to have it until the grandfather got involved then he should get it. Also is the husbands stepmother somehow involved. All in all a lot of info needed before I think we can accurately judge anyone here.", "You should suggest taking it to a jeweler to have it turned into two necklaces or two pairs of earrings or something so both sons can carry on the tradition without hard feelings.", "What about your husband\u2019s mom and stepmom?

The step brother was adopted later making him the second child. Therefore the necklace should go to OP.", "That applies to both women.", "The necklace belonged to your husband's mother, not to your FIL's secong wife. \n\nIt was meant to be given to his wife. You can honour the family tradition without  feeling guilty or guilt tripped by your MIL, stepbrother or even your friend.", "I like this idea very much. A good jeweler could probably turn the one necklace into two identical necklaces (maybe using cheaper stones so it doesn't cost a fortune) and the husbands would be none the wiser. They could keep on with their penis-measuring competition while the wives could just get on with things.", "But it sounds like the dad wanted it to go to the adopted son but the grandpa pulled rank and vetoed it. Dad chose oldest son, grandpa chose oldest bio son.", "Fair enough. They should both reject it.", "Heirlooms are dumb anyway", "I actually edited my comment after you replied. But I think if the dad is the one who has the necklace he should get to decide who gets it. That said I depending on how they became stepbrothers wouldn\u2019t the husbands mom have it? Unless they got divorced and the father took it back afterwards. I\u2019m wondering why the grandfather decided to step in and pull \u201crank\u201d it could be an AH move and doesn\u2019t recognize the stepbrother as his grandkid but depending on the family dynamics that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing as presumably the stepbrother may have his own biograndparents he\u2019s close to, also maybe this is a case of dad remarrying and paying more attention to new wife and kids in which case grandfather may be butting in to make sure dads bio son isn\u2019t forgotten or neglected. Can\u2019t really assume anything as we need more info, I\u2019m a little biased in that regard as when my own grandfather got remarried we all kind of felt his new wife kind of usurped him and focused his attention on her family and when he passed everything was left to her, her kids and grandkids. Messy situation.", "You shouldn't adopt a child if you aren't prepared to treat them as your child.

It's basically only the case in situations where the other parent is already dead or has had their parental rights terminated already", "So FIL had your husband and then got divorced from his first wife. FIL then married his second wife and adopted step brother. Does that mean your MIL had the necklace? Your husband is the first born so the necklace should go to you. That\u2019s how the tradition would work. Kind of sounds like step brother wants to be acknowledged and your friend wants the necklace for herself. I get you don\u2019t want to mess up your friendship but that also means you are picking your friend over your husband. I guess you guys should both not take the necklace and stop the tradition is you guys can\u2019t figure this out.", "Honestly you should have taken the heirloom. You chose your best friend over your husband. And I don't think your husband will ever get over it because you kind of betrayed him in a way. It's his heirloom anyways. It doesn't really matter that his adoptive brother wants it because at the end of the day he is the biological son and grandson. I do think your husband knew about the heirloom from an early age on and he always knew it was his. If his dad gave it to his adoptive brother there would have been a total scandal.

Why his mom doesnt have it, is not in the picture is unknown to us. But shouldnt it have been passed down to your husbands mom?then wouldnt she have passed it down to you? But if she's not in the picture then your husbands father has possession of it. Remember your husband is still the firstborn son. Years later, his stepbrother came along and became adopted. Your husbands now adopted brother may be older, but he is not the first born son of your FIL. Adoption doesnt kick out a person's birthright.  Think of it as british royalty. The heir and a spare.
