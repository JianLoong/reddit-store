If there was only one wife, who had two sons, I think it is different and it should go to the oldest.", "NTA.  Your best friend is TA for insisting that she's entitled to an heirloom that didn't go to her.  Your husband and his grandfather are TA for insisting that you accept an heirloom that you don't want.

Heirlooms and wealth can skip generations- it\u2019s allowed.. \n\n\nalso, what happens if there are no sons? Or if those sons partners are not female? There needs to be some modernization of this tradition.", "NTA. His father ADOPTED that stepbrother. Your position is sound.", "NAH.

It's just their family tradition. Your sister-in-law is a grown woman and understand that this is a tradition and grandfather has a right to continue it.

Obviously your husband is his first grandson and the step (or bil) came after that, whether he's older or not. Maybe the FIL told him directly? idk.\n\nTbh I don't know why your best friend and BIL had that expectation to have it, unless he was told he will be getting it. If this affects your relationship then that's sad on their part. Yikes!\n\nNTA and I don't even think your husband is either. What i do think is grandfather needs to sit BIL down and explain why he wants it to go to your husband. The entitlement of your bestfriend is quite shocking imo, especially if she's taking it out on you.", "YTA \n\nFirst for picking your bestie over your husband.  Your married, therfore a team, a united front. \n\n\nI'm guessing your FIL had your husband as his son first, seeing as you have stated your BIL was 11yrs old when adopted.  So your husband was the only and oldest for his first years until BIL came to the family. (You never stated the age difference). This means he's entitled to have the necklace, sorry. Regardless of who's older, your husband has been in the family longest and is still technically the oldest son. Adoption is only a formality of law, not genetics. And most times it comes down to blood, not law of adoption.  \n\nQuestion is who do you love most, your husband who you took vows with or a best friend? Are you willing to lose a marriage over something you really have no control over? I can't see the elders changing their minds over who will receive it just because you say so. Tbh, its not your decision because its not your tradition.", "Drama is happening regardless of accepting it or not.\n\n\nI'd accept it for my husband and not wear it .", "What a shitty situation. Technically, it should go to your friend considering the step- bother is older, but I can see how being \"adopted\" still causes a separation, which in itself is a big issue. Personally I think family heirlooms cause more issues than they're worth. But I digress. \n\n\\-NAH. \n\nYou have every right to reject it. However, you will always be seen as the AH from your husband and his family. It seems this family has deeper issues than just with this heirloom.", "NTa\n\nbut I can see why the grandfather wants it to go to you. \n\nHe wants the family heirloom to stay with blood family. If it's given to the others, it would be leaving the family.", "Nta.  But honestly it should go to you.  You are the biological sons wife.  And if it's a family heirloom it should be yours.", "How long has the stepson been the stepson?  My opinion the heirlooms should be kept in a biological family. If it goes to the stepson then it will be passed down to a completely different line.  I do think you are a jerk for not receiving the necklace.  Maybe the parents should buy a same value necklace for the stepson to begin on his side", "This right here, OP. Lock 'em all in a room until they sort themselves out and stop trying to put this on you and your friend/SIL. NTA\n\n(Who would want a piece of jewelry that causes so much family strife?? Cursed, indeed.)", "Any chance the necklace could be redesigned and turned into two necklaces?", "Definitely not over. It just would have opened up a different can of worms.", "This! Perfectly said.", "That\u2019s a very good point. Since the necklace is given *to the wife* then doesn\u2019t it belong to the husband\u2019s mother? Who does she want it to go to? Why is the FIL the one deciding?\n\nI\u2019m also wondering if OP\u2019s husband was born before or after the older son was adopted. If so, I can see an argument that OP\u2019s husband was a son to FIL first in time, and BIL became a son later, but if that\u2019s not the case then it seems even more like an AH move on FIL\u2019s part to be shunning his adoptive son in favor of his bio son. \n\nEither way OP is NTA", "I feel like it's not about an old trinket but the recognition of an adopted son being less than a blood son, which is horrible.", "He does call him dad and his bio dad isn't in the picture. He was 11 when he was adopted.", "FIL wanted to give it to his stepson though, it was FIL\u2019s father who insisted it go to OP.", "Not his stepson, his adopted son.", "Yeah I came to inquire about the specifics of the necklace. Then split it into 2 other sentimental items to be inclusive would be a potentially cool option. Or maybe just not pass it down yet and just loan it out for special events. Get creative, sidestep the issue. It's gunna be an issue forever if you don't get an amicable solution going.", "I was going to say this, would it be expensive to get a copy made? Then you both can have one and no one even needs to know which is the original.", "If the grandfather had already died Dad would have given the necklace to the SIL (adopted step-son's wife) and that would have changed it.", "I think that would add further drama that neither the SIL or OP want. I think the easiest way was just to reject it on principle and be done with the bullshit.", "My husband wouldn't be okay with that and it would cause even more problems.", "That doesn't mean she has to accept it. Weird comment.", "And technically, whoever wants can refuse and is NTA", "Oh yeah. That won\u2019t solve a huge family blow up that causes her friend to get attacked.", "That would be the biggest asshole move ever, why would you even suggest that?", "Wow. What a horrible take.", "Wow. When you adopt a child they ARE your family. How horribly sad this attitude is for every adopted child.", "No, because then they can\u2019t play generational tug-of-war.", "Yeah. I feel like there is a missing element.

The other daughter-in-law being your best friend sure does muck things up. \n\nI have a brother who is technically a half-brother, who is technically my dad\u2019s step son. Everyone usually forgets it. My dad has dementia now and often talks about physical features my brother\u2019s kids got from him. It\u2019s super sweet and really shows how much my brother is my dad\u2019s son in my dad\u2019s eyes. \n\nThat said, before dementia, if we had any similar family heirlooms I\u2019m 100% my dad would have wanted me to get them. I also would feel a bit entitled to them. And I also recognize how unfair and shitty that would be to my brother.", "Ahh I misunderstood. He should just be happy he's living to see multiple great grandchildren. That is a rare thing!", "Really, did I say that the father wanted to give it to his stepson?", ">he has an older stepbrother", "She did reject it. She said she rejected it and they keep pressing.", "OP, what about your MIL? Your husband's mom? Is she stepbrother's mom? If not, what happened to her? And is that why your husband feels so strongly about the necklace. I kind of wonder if you are putting your best friend's feelings ahead of your husband's and the missing element is the difference in verdict for me", "Well...yeah. He's completely unreasonable. There isn't a way to appease completely unreasonable people. They are going to give you strife until you accept it. And then they will give you strife over something else. \n\nHonestly, I would melt it down, but do whatever you feel is right.", "No, it means she should because it\u2019s important to the family and as a member of the family it is best to show respect and support", "Oh, sorry, my bad, I thought they might actually want to stop the generational tug of war.\n\nSeriously, I totally get being left out of family heirloom stuff. I'm related to all the old-money families, the type of people who holiday at Providence and look down their nose at Cape Cod, but always through the sixth son who ran off with the maid and got disinherited. If even one of my ancestors had kept it in his pants . . .  But on the upside at least I'll never have to get involved in petty squabbles over necklaces. So, there's that.", "I suppose if husbands mom had died I\u2019d reluctantly have to agree on OP being TA. OP seems to be saying no because she\u2019s empathetic and doesn\u2019t want to hurt BIL or SIL, but if it was something of her husband\u2019s mom\u2019s and it means a lot to husband that his mom\u2019s necklace be passed on to his wife, then OP would be the asshole to ignore that. I\u2019d sympathize because OP is in a no-win situation, though. \n\nThat was a good catch, it definitely makes a big difference.", "'Who his father adopted'", "this is very important to my point.  Often step parents will adopt their spouses child.   If this was a child adopted via other means, I think it's a lot different.", "Yes, I know. I was affirming OP's decision to reject it as the easiest way.", "Absolutely. Split the stones up, melt down the metal, and have two matching necklaces made.", "You again? No, she does not have to participate. Very simple, and it's shitty that they were fine to give the necklace to the BIL/SIL *until* they found out OP was pregnant. Why was it all of a sudden a deciding factor then?", "I think OP is the only one who would like off this stupid ride. Otherwise the adult men would solve their problems without involving their various spice.

Watching them fight over the crumbs of a loved one\u2019s life has left me with absolutely no interest in these interfamilial spats. Yeah, I like that painting (insert jewelry, antique book, car, whatever) It\u2019s nice.
