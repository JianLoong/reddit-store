{"id": 29525, "submission_id": "17eqlrp", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to not come to my prenatal appointment", "selftext": "Prior to my fourth prenatal appointment, my husband and I got into a fight.  The fight occurred while I was describing a situation at work and got frustrated and emotional while explaining myself.  My husband was questioning and challenging my interpretation of it and I felt he was being argumentative so I said \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t understand, you don\u2019t have to work with gossips and judgemental people\u201d (he works from home and has limited in person interaction with other people for his job).  I started crying out of frustration and he got angry and said I was blowing up over nothing.  He then went silent and didn\u2019t speak to me the rest of the day.  His conflict management style is the silent treatment, often for days, sometimes for 1-2 weeks at a time.  Anticipating this, I told him that if we were not on speaking terms at the time of my prenatal appointment, that I do not feel comfortable with him coming and that I would get ultrasound images and provide a summary of the appointment for him.  I told this to him in words and by text.  Well he showed up to my prenatal appointment and forced himself in.  I was too humiliated to make a scene but quietly said \u201cWTF are you doing here\u201d.  Afterwards he said \u201cit\u2019s our baby so it\u2019s our appointment\u201d and I said \u201cactually I am the patient and it\u2019s my appointment and you are there as a visitor\u201d.  I told him I felt violated and betrayed. Truly I feel bullied by his behavior and would like an apology.  I wanted him to be there, and he has come to most of my other appointments, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with him being there if he was engaging in the silent treatment and aggression.  He maintains that he has every right to be at my doctors appointments whether I am okay with it or not.\n\n\nEditing to add a big thank you to everyone who has commented and shared their story of any similar experiences, positive or negative.  I didn\u2019t expect the volume and polarity of responses this post has received.  I\u2019m reading through every comment and taking your thoughts to heart.  Thank you.\n\n2nd edit:  I\u2019m overwhelmed by the number of comments.  I thought this post would fly under the radar.  To respond to some questions/clarifications and provide updates:\n-  My husband asked to speak with me this evening and we had a calm and productive talk.  This is a quick turn around time for him.  He clarified that he did overreact and blow up over my crying due to him misunderstanding something I said, and that he did think my being upset about work was valid.\n- I did not anticipate the amount of responses regarding my mention of the silent treatment.  I now wish I didn\u2019t mention it in this particular post, though appreciate all your advice especially the heartfelt and enlightening responses from those of you who suffered under a parent or partner, and those of you who use or have used the silent treatment yourselves.  There have been a handful of instances of the silent treatment that were 1-3 weeks long.  Most other instances were a few days.  I knew the silent treatment was wrong, it makes me feel terrible and I know it can be abusive when used to manipulate or punish.  I don\u2019t recall him using the silent treatment like that until last year so this oddly wasn\u2019t an issue earlier in our relationship, even though he describes it as a long term behavior for him that was normal growing up in his family.  I spoke tonight about how damaging it was and my fear for his doing it again in front of, or to, our kid.  He agreed it was unacceptable and has to change.  I also have some conflict responses of my own that I\u2019d like to work on.\n- My husband does individual therapy and has for some time.  I do not currently plan on doing couples therapy again as I did not find it very productive, rather sometimes counterproductive.  We both will continue individual therapy.\n- For those asking why did I have a baby with this man:  I have provided one glimpse into our relationship and though it is an ugly one, it\u2019s just a glimpse.  I\u2019m happy, not miserable, the majority of the time.  I think my AITA question of the prenatal appointment is debatable, but agree that the silent treatment is awful and unacceptable behavior even if it\u2019s not done maliciously.  I\u2019m pregnant now with a very wanted baby and will have work very hard on ensuring a loving safe and healthy environment is provided no matter what that requires of myself or my husband.", "created_utc": 1698083790, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17eqlrp/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_not_come_to_my/", "score": 3723, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This should probably be addressed before your baby is born. At best, it's showing significant communication issues from him;  at worst, it's emotional abuse. Withholding communication/emotional connections is hard enough for an adult, but its downright cruel to children and can significantly impact their emotional and developmental growth. If this is how your husband handles conflict with another adult who has equal footing as him, he will definitely do this to a vulnerable child.

When he goes silent he doesn't go silent for a couple hours, or a couple days, or even a couple weeks. I'm talking going silent for months going on years.\n\nI don't have a much of a relationship with my Aunt (she married his brother) and her 2 kids. This is because at some point when I was a baby my dad got upset with her and began to do the silent treatment to her. This rightfully upset both her and her kids and they didn't want to come visit if they were just going to be treated that way and they didn't want him to visit if he was going to treat her like that in her own home. Growing up her husband was my favorite uncle, he'd be over at least once a month to visit. I didn't know he was married or had kids until I was 16 and didn't meet his wife or my cousins until I was 18. Even though both they and I want to have a relationship together it's hard overcoming that barrier.\n\nThe same thing happened with my Aunt's (father's sister) second husband. She got remarried long before I was born after her 1st husband died. Up until I was about 6 I would always go over to visit her side of the family. Her husband had 3 kids from a previous marriage and my aunt had none but they have a son together so I have four cousins all together on that side of the family. All of their kids are much older than me with the youngest being 18 years older than me. The three eldest also all had kids either before or around the time I was born so there are another 10-12 cousins on that side.\n\n I would always be playing with them and hanging out until one day when I was 8 we just suddenly cut off all contact with them and didn't see them for 6 years. Being 8 and this being the early 2000s, there wasn't really a way for me to keep in contact with any of my cousins. We only got back in contact with them when my dad's brother, his sister, her husband and her youngest kid came to my house and essentially BEGGED him to stop his silent treatment because they wanted to have a relationship with me. (btw this didn't stop his silent treatment of my dad's SIL). To this day I still feel the after effects of this separation because I went from being super close with all those cousins to NC to coming back and all of them having tons of in-jokes and close-bonds and even though they never meant to make me feel this way I've always felt like an outsider whenever I visit.\n\nI have TONS of stories like this but if neither of those can convince you to re-think this let me give you MY story with my dad. This is getting a bit long so the tldr of it is that when I was 14 I left the house to go to a study group for a final after my dad forbid me from leaving. I was worried I'd let my friends down since I was in-charge of the subject we were discussing that day and I had already gotten so much help. I came back home expecting to be given a scolding or grounded or something but nope, SILENT TREATMENT. That man did not talk to me again until I was 22. I BEGGED him to just acknowledge my existence but he refused. He skipped my High School and my college graduation to just sit at home and watch tv. It wasn't until he had a heart attack that he decided to start talking to me again.\n\nSo this is my extremely long comment begging you from the perspective of a child with a parent who does the \"Silent\" treatment to either get your husband therapy and help to deal with this or save you kid the trauma and get out of that relationship. I wish my mom divorced my dad when I was 14 or when I was 16 and he locked me outside of the house because he was ignoring my existence which means when I rang the doorbell on a day I forgot my keys he wouldn't answer because I didn't exist to him.\n\nYes I understand these are extreme examples and he might not be that bad but according to my mom, my dad also wasn't this bad in the beginning.", "Your husband is abusive and you are right.

He needs to take an hour or two, think objectively, calm down, and then re-address.

Instead, you just wanted to be _heard_, not told it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Have I got that about right?\n\nWhat it comes down to is that he needs to understand that you don\u2019t require him to fix it. In fact, you will come out and _say_ when you want him to do something practical (this means not using \u201chints\u201d because some people won\u2019t get them and it will be \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you just tell me\u2026\u201d ) He needs to learn to listen and try to empathize.\n\nWhen I wanted my husband to be a sounding board, I would preface my rants about stuff with that information.

You might want to get some books on communication so that you two work on how to communicate with one another as well as when the child comes into your life. \n\nI do believe that in anger we say and feel so many different things and being pregnant is not helping with all the hormones. My advice if you allow me to give it to you is to tell each other I can't listen to you and regardless of how many times we repeat the same thing, neither is truly hearing each other. Let's step away and come back after 2 hours to discuss this issue even if we agree to disagree. \n\nGood luck and congratulations on your new addition.", "Listen, the argument itself didn't sound too bad for me, you're hormonal and frustrated with work, he wasn't very understanding but from your account didn't sound malicious.

I can't imagine not speaking to my partner for days, no matter how frustrated or angry I am. \n\nYes, we have arguments, but I wouldn't be with him if they were of a nature where we don't respect each other because of them or don't speak to each other for days.", "I see women come on this sub and describe emotional abuse, then they justify staying and having a child because he's so great otherwise! \n\nJust this one cruel and humiliating thing and recent betrayal of trust and autonomy.

And the way he was acting afterwards, pushing his way into the prenatal appointment even after abusing you, is class a controlling behavior. \n\nI know this is only a glimpse but it also feels like you may be minimizing these warning signs. Abusive relationships are not always miserable, otherwise nobody would stay in them. The silent treatment for more than a night, the controlling behavior, his disrespect for your bodily autonomy, all of it is deeply concerning.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s possible to work through this with therapy and I\u2019m glad you plan to stay on top of it to give your child a safe, loving environment.", "Your body, your choice.

Then the doctor comes and asks me if there is anything I want to discuss before my husband comes in. Only then do they let him come back. It\u2019s been the same for the last decade.

On paper I understood what gaslighting and manipulation was. But actually standing up for myself and executing any action based on what I knew was happening to me was a massive, massive hurdle. Manipulation seems to work sometimes anyway even when you identify it as manipulation. \n\nMost of that behavior was what OP was describing. It\u2019s hell. It\u2019s pure hell. Being questioned, assuming you are always wrong, even about stuff they have no knowledge in, it\u2019s undermining on such a deep level. This isn\u2019t some small thing OP. Your gut and your emotions are telling you that he\u2019s a bad person. But you\u2019re stuffing them down and forcing a relationship with him anyway.  You\u2019re not crying for no reason. Self esteem is closer to a physical organ than an intangible object \u2014 it gets damage, and having it degraded and stomped on isn\u2019t something you should ever accept from a partner. \u201cNot accepting it\u201d means telling them to stop, and if they won\u2019t, leaving. It took me years to do the second part. Now, I feel confident, it\u2019s absurd.\n\nAll this to say, OP, you have a massive hurdle ahead of you.

My dad worked long hours and she was often the only human contact I had after school.  I once asked my dad why I had to apologize to her when I didn't do anything wrong.  This was during one of the multiple times she \"moved out\" because my apology essays were insufficiently remorseful.  She would stay in a hotel until I called her and begged for her forgiveness.  My dad said it was just easier to apologize even if I didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI get reprimanded at work for apologizing too much now.

You were supposed to find a way to show you were sorry but never say it or discuss it. It was not always clear since that is not a replacement for clear communication so it led to some resentment building up. It was just a very poor way to communicate. My first serious adult relationship suffered because she didn't know this unspoken family code i was following. I could tell she was super angry at me for trying to do these little actions when I wasn't communicating in the way a normal person would expect. When I did eventually try to explain it she had a WTF look and told me none of that was normal or healthy. We did not last much longer, and I think that was really when she checked out of the relationship. I had to work on it a lot and I still fall back into that trap.
