It was an antique, which I absolutely loved and I wore it all the time. \n\nWe broke up earlier this year without any issues. It just didn\u2019t work out, there were no hard feelings and we\u2019ve been civil since then. Though I loved the ring, I couldn\u2019t get myself to wear it anymore, especially since it reminded me too much of our time together. I decided to gift it to my cousin who absolutely adored it. \n\nThe other day, my ex contacted me to ask for the ring back. Apparently he had stolen it from his mother (I was not aware of this), and it was actually a family heirloom and his mother was distraught looking for it. He didn\u2019t realize its value at the time he gifted it to me.\n\nI told him I couldn\u2019t return it anymore because it was already with my cousin. He told me it wasn\u2019t supposed to be a big deal, and that I can just explain to my cousin that he made a mistake and that he really needs it back. \n\nI feel really bad for having to take it back from my cousin who obviously really loves it. But at the same time, I also feel bad for his mother who had lost the ring, if what he is saying is true. However, he also recently got a new gf and I can\u2019t help but feel like he just wants the ring back to gift to her instead.\n\nI feel really stuck. Any advice would be helpful and I need to know if I would be the asshole if I refuse to give it back.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
