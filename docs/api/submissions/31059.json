People always ask why I use such \u201cbig words\u201d. It\u2019s really a habit & just having good vocabulary lol. I would absolutely use \u201cspat\u201d instead of \u201csaid\u201d if it was the best way to describe the tone, cus it does make a difference.", "mb im in college classes for language arts \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f old habits die hard", "hop off my dick bruhhh yall r weird", "All women's volleyball shorts are spandex.", "so ur saying that my intentions are to attract the attention of boys? how would you know any of this? it\u2019s strange. i rlly js wanna play volleyball without being sexualized or told i can\u2019t wear something that is practical and comfortable and forced to wear something that can hurt me. i play volleyball to play volleyball. nothing more.", "right but spandex is shorts. it\u2019s not running, it\u2019s for volleyball for full range of motion. and i\u2019m not wearing them just to wear them, im wearing them to play a sport that requires a lot of movement and agility.", "yes, but my club also does drills and scrimmages.", "So? She's wearing her school's volleyball uniform, it isn't her fault if it's \"distracting\" - are they animals incapable of self control?", "nah u weird tf", "... Germany. Some parts of the highway have no speed limit.", "Because a cool day in summer here in my part of CA is between 105-110", "It\u2019s not disingenuous, the mother isn\u2019t the one exercising. I wore spandex shorts to track practice all the time in high school because they didn\u2019t get in my way and didn\u2019t cause chaffing. It\u2019s about comfort, not trying to look cute. They\u2019re basically standard now in running sports and volleyball for good reason", "ik someone accused me of being 40??? like thanks for the compliment gng but \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude4f", "Search girls sports shorts on amazon.

Why does that matter?", "Ya mama", "Just stay out of the left lane!", "It is, the poster is a child, her mothers knows better. Underarmor and many other athletics companies make anti-chaffing shorts. I played basketball all through highschool and beyond in them, you don\u2019t see us wearing tight underwear for \u201ccomfort\u201d. Come on, we all know why y\u2019all wear those shorts, there\u2019s so many other options, but there not \u201ccute\u201d enough for y\u2019all.", "I didn\u2019t know using more \u201cadvanced\u201d words was indicative of being 40 LMFAO.. ignore \u2018em. \ud83d\ude01 Also NTA, clearly. Your mom has some issues she should talk to someone about lol.", "What part of **VOLLEYBALL SHORTS** is difficult for you to understand?\n\nIt's a specific type of sport uniform.", "it\u2019s the actual team uniform and yea u can but spandex is easier", "There\u2019s a reason why those shorts are worn for a wide variety of sports and activities like working out. It\u2019s all I wore for gymnastics and cheer and dance too. They\u2019re the best ones and they\u2019re preferred for a reason. They move with you, don\u2019t stick to the skin when sweating, don\u2019t make you chafe, and are completely opaque. You can\u2019t compare them to underwear. It\u2019s weird trying to police others bodies.", "so we\u2019re playing volleyball at conditioning? meaning we need to wear clothes for volleyball?", "It comes down to what you personally find comfortable, and they are very comfortable imo. There is nothing wrong with spandex shorts for a teen. There is no need to sexualize a piece of clothing.", "Its conditioning, not game time. Played volleyball for years myself for my high school team. During conditioning we wear what we want. During games we had uniforms. The post is talking about conditioning not actual games.", "Yeah so put on a pants since you can still play or dont play at all if you cant?", "If there\u2019s a reason why those shorts are worn, as you say, why do men/boys where regular shorts for volleyball and compete at high levels with full range of motion, while women/girls wear that tight underwear?", "Men's volleyball almost exclusively has loose shorts or swim shorts and tank tops. How are loose shorts a problem for you playing volleyball?", "our club makes us wear uniform for conditioning because we\u2019re lifting and running and it can interfere with safety. also my mom wanted me to wear sweats.", "im not gonna wear pants for a sport that has shorts as the UNIFORM. and im def not just gonna not play? not sure why ur so mad im wearing clothes made for sports to a sport. you\u2019re pretty silly.", "It\u2019s not tight underwear. It\u2019s not just what I\u2019m saying either, any amount of looking into it would tell you that\u2019s what most wear. It\u2019s a fact. And do I really need to explain to you why men may not find the same clothing preferable? Hmm maybe because squishing their dick and balls against their skin is a bit different??  Don\u2019t pretend to be dense.", "MENS volleyball. it\u2019s our uniform in girls volleyball to wear short and tight shorts.", "Doormatty, you were right! I was wrong. Leaving this here since its active thread but definitely NTA.", "\u2026. Your Nta but that\u2019s not true about bagger shorts interfering with your safety. And even playing volleyball I\u2019d probably have a problem if coaches made my daughter wear them to lift weights. When I think back to every coach I had across 3 sports, maybe two wasn\u2019t giving off creeper vibes.", "I was asking why can\u2019t women/girls wear the full length shorts, not the other way around of course. Although it was a rhetorical question because we all know why girls and women wear those \u201cshorts\u201d, it\u2019s because the regular full length, anti chafing shorts that are specifically designed for comfort and range of motion aren\u2019t \u201ccute\u201d enough for y\u2019all.", "If this was the uniform why wasn't that mentioned in the original post?

I clearly say they were what\u2019s preferred. And the preferred shorts are just as anti chafing, comfortable, and allow a full range of motion too. The tighter ones were actually mandatory for safety reasons for gymnastics and cheer in fact. \n\nBut sure, despite facts and actual people telling you it\u2019s not about being cute, you\u2019ll just double down instead. You know better than everyone else right?? Your poor daughters. Do better and grow up. Women don\u2019t just do things only to look cute at all times. At least now I see you\u2019re not just pretending to be dense\u2026", "as i said, my mom didn\u2019t play sports.", "That's standard for women's volleyball. Most people wouldn't feel the need to mention they wear a helmet and shoulder pads when playing football."]}
