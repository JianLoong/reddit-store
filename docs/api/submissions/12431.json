One of them was a 12-year-old boy who brought a doll-type thing which glowed and made noises if you pressed a button. We opened the present later after the party, and even though my son was happy to receive it, I noticed that the toy had a cracked shoulder.\n\nThe next day, when the boy came to play with my son and the other kids, I asked him who brought the gift, and he said he did it. I showed him the broken part and lightly scolded him. I simply told him that if he was going to spend money buying something, he should've checked the thing. I gave it back to him and told him to ask the store to replace it since it's broken. I thought it was a good life lesson and that he'd remember this. It would help him when he buys something later on. It would teach him not to waste his money.\n\nHowever, later that evening his mom called me and told me that I was very rude to her son. She said and I quote \"if someone gives you a gift, you just appreciate it and don't say anything even if it's not that good, especially when it's a kid\" Turns out, he bought it with his own pocket money, and he put a lot of thought into it. He did replace the gift, but he has stopped coming to play with my son. AITA? I genuinely didn't mean to upset him. I didn't even really scold him. I talked to him very gently and only explained it to him.\n\nEdit: Alright, I'll accept that I was TA and apologize.", "created_utc": 1678971441, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11stf6m/aita_for_lightly_scolding_a_12yearold_because_the/", "score": 4337, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
