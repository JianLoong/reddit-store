Now my kids (older is a preteen) rarely miss school and usually only end up at the Dr for wellness visits (physicals or immunizations)", "It\u2019s also stupid- once the oldest enters primary school, they\u2019re going to bring germs home to the younger one(s) anyways", "That sounds so confusing and complicated \ud83d\ude2c I don't even see that icon anywhere", ">I\u2019ve never met a single person that thinks it\u2019s irresponsible to ever have kids in school or daycare.\n\nAnecdotal evidence is meaningless. The very fact homeschooling exists means your perception is faulty.\n\nI had several friends growing up whose parents pulled them from school / daycare because of their personal beliefs.", "You'd be surprised in how many people believe daycare or kindergarten are useless... Even regular school is deemed useless by many people who take the homeschooling route for their own personal beliefs and not because of some requirements that have to do with their children's needs.", "I have. Lots of people. I was a SAHM and people felt free to applaud me for the decision and tell me how terrible daycare is. From friends and family members to random people to my daughter's medical team.", "Seriously... like, obviously there's limits on what you *should* be exposing them to (looking at *you*, anti-vaxxers, and your \"pox parties\" and the like), but it's a fact of life that kids get sick and it's not some horrible failure on the parents' part.", "I'd bet she has.", "Exactly this. Kids need to be exposed to some little things so they can fight bigger problems if need be.", "Change names legally, dont have full names on social media, make all social media private, no profile pics etc.", "Same! My daughter was a year old when she started daycare. After that first week, she had a double ear infection. She is now 18 and has been sick a few times, only once she missed school. She had a stomach bug twice in her daycare years, the flu in the 5th grade (happened on the last day before winter break), and food poisoning once in high school (this was the only time she missed school). That's it!  Granted she did give the flu to her grandfather and it turned into pneumonia for him, he still reminds her to this day about it.  lol", "when you answer on a comment, below your typed text there is **B** for big, *i* for italics, the three dots. click on the dots and it appears the sign for link, ~~S~~, < c >, A, the rhombus. if it is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th comment in a thread it can be that you only see the three dots. \n\nthese icons are left from the markdown mode, cancel, send.", "Put a >!

It's too common and some of my closest friends grew up this way and their first and main time of socialising was during college because their parents wouldn't allow it before that because of personal beliefs.", "Chicken pox parties weren't a terrible idea before a vaccine was widely available and before the link to shingles was known. It is better to get it young than when you're older. Now that a vaccine is widely available and we know that having it can cause shingles later, they're completely idiotic.", "Oh definitely, I wouldn't deliberately expose kids to stuff like Covid or chicken pox, that's a definite no no, and any future kids I have *will* be having their vaccines. But all kids get common childhood illness whether it's from daycare, school etc, it's just a fact of life. It sucks, but it's the way it goes. \n\nPlus you can tell when someone has grown up in a too sterile environment their whole life, because they're the adults who are always sick and they can't even fight off a cold without it knocking them off their feet.", "Yah, Every kid eats dirt, probably even more so in the past, and we\u2019re still movin as a species.", "Oh, okay, it's like I was thinking, it's probably not available on mobile.
