Next time, she should be more observant.", "NTA. Your property, your rules.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you tell your friend about the cameras? Sounds like she has a guilty mind. Besides just missing the obvious signs.", "So because someone lacks the brain power to process what a sign says he is TA?", "That sounds like a miserable existence. People are just tracking you with cameras everywhere you go?", "It doesn\u2019t seem like OP was offended at the idea of sex just the location because it was caught on video and the friend was being a jerk about it.", "What kind of messed up place do you live in? I don't know a single person with a camera on their house.", "And that grey foam...", "No \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f there\u2019s only 4 units on my floor. Only I have a camera cus only 2 aren\u2019t occupied and the other her kids kept messing with it", "Everywhere has cameras? Stores,stop lights,gas stations,medical offices eye. People\u2019s cars now with dash cam,then tik tokers. \n\nI don\u2019t use it for snooping just to see who knocks on my door.", "They are outdoor cameras so no one is being watched 24/7. They shouldn't have been doing anything like that in someone's hot tub that they said they wouldn't even use.", "Oh god. That does seem like a risk of putting college aged males in situations where they have to share a bedroom. At least I hope it inspired more of them to actually take daily showers?", "Staph is passed skin to skin not through bodily fluids. So she either got it from her partner or it was in the water but not from bodily fluids.", "Sure, I can see why you would want one.  I'm not against them, so much as I think people need to be aware of the \"dark side\".\n\nTW\n\nI'm having a hard time getting through to our property manager,and to an extent, other directors, to understand how big an issue misuse of the security cams is, and why it's a major issue for me.  Not going to be happy if I have to lay it all out at a meeting \"Well, because I've had a few stalkers in my past, and one ended up with me getting raped.\"   It's not like they aren't decent people, they just don't get why it bothers me, and, honestly, they'd be as upset as me to hear my reason.\n\nAnyway - Good plan with your security and evidence.  Shame you have to do it, but it would be foolish to do nothing."]}
