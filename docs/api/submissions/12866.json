I am the baker of the family. My sister admires my skills and would often try to help out whenever I\u2019d bake. I moved out in November after getting married so my sister and I no longer work together in the kitchen. I do miss it because it's flattering that she admires me and likes to help, but she is less meticulous and often messes up small steps in the recipes.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I told my sister I was planning on baking the cake for our parents\u2019 25th. She immediately suggested she make it herself since she has never gotten to before. I was hesitant but eventually agreed and requested that I at least help. She was ecstatic and refused to accept my help, and was insistent on making it entirely on her own, claiming her baking had improved. I was nervous but dropped the subject (a mistake).\n\nI called on Friday to ask her how the cake was going (the party was on Saturday), and she confided in me that it wasn\u2019t going as well as she wanted it to due to the frosting curdling. I immediately regretted letting her take over because I knew she was inexperienced. She said she was going to remake the frosting, but I was still uncertain of how this was going to turn out, so I decided I\u2019d take it in my hands to make a second cake on my own.\n\nOn Saturday everything was prepared, but my sister's cake honestly looked horrible. My sister didn\u2019t do as she promised and used the curdled frosting, claiming they were \u201cout of ingredients to make more\u201d. I appreciate the work she put into it and I know she means well but it was truthfully not in the least presentable. Because of this I brought my own cake that I had made the day before to the party and swapped out her cake with mine. My sister threw an absolute fit. This created an awkward situation for guests that were just arriving. I felt bad doing it but this was my parents\u2019 25th, and if my sister wasn\u2019t going to take the cake seriously I was within my right to replace it especially since I put more care into the one I made than she did. I know she is inexperienced but that is exactly why I should not have trusted her with this task in the first place. My parents are upset with me and suggested we serve both cakes but I refused. They asked that I either comply or I\u2019d need to leave for a bit and \u201ctake a breather\u201d. Their asking this made me blow up because I had more of a part in this than my sister. The only one on my side is my husband. My sister now is not speaking to me. I understand she worked hard on the cake but she should be understanding that her cake was not presentable. I feel I was within my right to swap out the cake but now I am unsure, aita?", "created_utc": 1679431620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xtxxm/aita_for_replacing_the_anniversary_cake_my_sister/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are so far up your own butt it's not even funny. You couldn't just let her make the cake and have the downfall be on her?

YTA. Your sister is 13 and desperately wants to be just like you by baking a cake for her parents, JUST LIKE YOU! All she does is look up to you and you squashed any self confidence she may have by telling her what she did isn't good enough.\n\nI hope you never have kids.", "YTA.\n\nYou took a moment and a memory away from your sister and parents because you wanted the limelight/adoration for whatever reason. You\u2019re putting her down for something she created, you should know better.", "YTA. Your little sister, who ~~idolizes~~ *idolized* you, baked an edible cake that didn\u2019t look as good as yours, **the professional baker**. You threw a fit because your parents wanted both the cakes. Here\u2019s a hint: *they were trying to appease **you**, not your sister*. You made their 25th anniversary all about you and your wants and needs, and also humiliated your sister in the process. Congratulations.", "YTA\n\nIt was not your place to swap the cakes. It sounds like the main problem with your sister's cake was the icing. Put both cakes out. People can scrape off the bad icing. Or you could offer your sister some replacement icing. Help her scrape off the old and put on new. But simply taking her cake was out of line.", "YTA!! Especially for ignoring your parents\u2019 wishes. It was THEIR anniversary, not yours. What made you think it was appropriate to blow up and act like a child in front of guests? OVER A CAKE?", "YTA no one came to that party to marvel at the cake. Way to ruin your parents\u2019 night.", "YTA - I mean, she was so excited and proud to make something for your parents doing her absolute best. I don\u2019t think you put more care into it. I think you could have handled it better by bringing small fruit tarts or truffle bites or something to complement the cake (and told her you would do that before the party) if you were worried about having nice options for guests.\n\nEdit: somehow missed she was 13. Yeah, definitely TA. You could have helped her with the time you took to make your own cake.", "Who cares about the looks of the cake as it was made with love and affection by a daughter for her parents.

There is no reason both cakes couldn't have been offered. Even your parents - who were supposed to be the ones celebrated - asked you to comply with that request and you refused. Their event was not about you and your superior baking skill!", "YTA. Not everything has to be about perfection. Your sister did something nice and you ruined it over your own insecurities.  Who cares if the cake had curdled frosting, she did a good job for a 13 year old.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my own sisters. You could have just told your sister, \u2018sounds like you have your hands full. Why don\u2019t I bring a cake as well and we can serve both?\u2019 Or  \u2018hey sis, how about we both just get a backup cake from the bakery if you can\u2019t get the icing right? Icing\u2019s hard, I made plenty of mistakes when doing it. Or I could just pay for the whole cake since you already done so much and I feel like I haven\u2019t contribute enough?\u2019 Or maybe not say or do anything other than, \u2018wow you really did a good job on the cake sis.\u2019", "YTA. What a cake tastes like is what matters, and there was no reason not to serve both cakes.", "YTA.  Your parents, whose party this was in honor of, wanted to serve both.  At their house.  This was not your place to refuse them that.", "YTA. If you knew she was going to mess it up, as her older sister, you should have been there to help her. Even if that is only being a bank to buy more supplies. Let her make the cake and instruct her how to do it or what ingredients she forgot.", "YTA. You're shitting on her because her cake doesn't look fantastic (and as nice as yours) for their 25th anniversary. She's 13 and I don't think I could've done that at her age. I don't see why you couldn't be ok with having both cakes served.", "yta\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...why did you have a cake ready to replace it in the first place?\n\nIt feels like you trusted your sister to fail so much that you put yourself on a high horse\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree with your parents, you should have served both. Your sister still made the cake out of love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour husband is wrong, you slighted your whole family at one time by disrespecting your sister and disrespecting your parents wishes of serving both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling your parents viewed your cake as unacceptable after you pulled this stunt. It would taste bitter from the energy you put into it.", "YTA, a lot I would suspect by your general demeanor.  You were an asshole when you made the cake betting on your sister's failure, and let's be clear, whether there was curdled icing or not, you made yours with the \"most care.\". You brought that cake intending to swap it out no matter what she made.\n\nYou arrived just late enough to do this in front of guests making you assholier.\n\nYou got upset because she got equal credit after both were served because you really like your cake the best.\n\nIt was awkward for everyone and your own Mom wanted you to leave.  But if you don't listen to ALL the people you know tell you you're an asshole, I am not sure me telling you will help stick the point.", "You know what, I missed the ages the first time around and thought YTA when we were talking about 2 grown sisters.\n\nNow that I realize she\u2019s 13? God, you are a massive AH.", "YTA. You could have just served both but you managed to make an occasion that was about your parents, to solely be about yourself and your baking skills. Clearly they were happy your sister made the effort.\n\nEdit to add: do you do this with other things as well? You should consider therapy to understand why you feel the need to make sure everything is perfect and undercut the people who don't abide by the same philosophy.", "YTA your parents wanted your sisters cake, you don't get to refuse anything, it wasn't your party and your condescending attitude towards your sister is unfair", "YTA. I get you're a baker, but you're taking this waaay to seriously. Your sister wanted to do something special on her own for your parents. You spoiled that for her, because you wanted every little detail to be perfect. But guess what? Things like that do not need to be perfect. This could have been a cute and maybe even funny thing to remember at later family gatherings, but no. Now this is a day that she and your parents will remember as a day where you could not let go of your passion for one day and spoiled the fun.", "I get that as a host or person in charge of planning something you want things to be perfect. But guests don't need everything to be perfect to have a good time. \n\nThe parents said it was fine to serve it so because of that...\n\nYTA.", "YTA - she might have failed but she put a lot of work into something that your parents wanted to see.

You made the day about you.", "YTA If it was edible, it should have been served.", "SHE\u2019S THIRTEEN. \n\nYTA.  \n\nDo you have any idea how many parents happily and proudly wolf down shitty meals because their kids made it for them? It\u2019s not about how it looks or even tastes, it\u2019s about the effort, it\u2019s about the fact that she badly wanted to do something nice for them!! And she did! \n\nThen you came along and ruined it. Ruined a perfectly normal and happy moment. Possibly tainted your sisters desire to learn to bake. Left a cloud of awkward and unhappyness over the entire event. And who the hell do you think you are that you refused to serve both cakes, even after your parents made it clear they would prefer that?\n\nYou just wanted to be the one that made the cake and got the credit.

And you will not be your sisters MOH!! This seems to happen on reddit everyday. \n\nYTA!!!", "They said they wanted both cakes only to appease my sister. They clearly weren't happy with it based on the looks on their faces and this is a special event that required my interference. I feel this was an opportunity to show my sister that if you are not going to take something important seriously, you can expect to have consequences. I appreciate her efforts and a part of me does feel bad for replacing her cake, but she receives lots of commendation from my parents on a daily basis and her not getting her way one time is not going to kill her.", "The downfall was on her LMAO! Her cake was much less popular, clearly because it probably wasn't as good TBH...completely erases the hard work I put into this party. But my sister is my parents' little princess so they will of course always appease her even if it means not speaking up for themselves. I eventually just did as they asked anyway. I realize she put effort into it but things like this do happen and she could have saved herself the embarrassment of realizing her cake was not as popular.", "Oh shit, I missed that the sister is thirteen. Yeah OP, Yta", "They wanted to appease my sister like they always do. She can handle a little disappointment sometimes. If my parents had let me do what I originally planned I also would have saved my sister the embarrassment of realizing her cake was the much less popular one.", "Seriously...good point, here. Like really? The sister looks up to this person who can't act like an adult in a situation where she feels she is in competition *with a 13 year old.*", "\"Superior\"", "Exactly this \\^ Positive support. Not angry entitled brat.", "TBH it probably didn't taste good either. She always overmixes the batter which causes a dense cake lol. I didn't have any but her cake was much less popular and likely for good reason", "I'm sure it was edible. My sister used my recipe. I could see from my parents' faces that they were unhappy with the cake but said nothing so they could spare my sister's feelings. I understand my sister put effort into the cake she made but I do feel I'm within my right to replace it considering I also practically planned the entire party and put time, money, and effort into this.", "i dont think she wanted the best, if she did she wouldn't have gone against the parents wishes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDoing that would automatically ruin the entire thing.", "It sounds like you think they didn't want the cake meanwhile it's *you* who didn't want it there. That special event doesn't require your specific interference as anyone could have planned it.\n\nAlso, this is not an opportunity to teach your 13 year old sister life isn't fair and that you should take things seriously. *It's a cake.* People have messed up cakes before and the fact that she made a homemade cake and it stayed together is way more than I could have done at her age. Who cares if it's not as pretty as yours? As long as it's edible, it's the thought that counts. As a parent, I would want both of the cakes my kids made.\n\nLastly, *how dare your little sister who is still a kid get praise from their parents.* You honestly just sound selfish and jealous of her. Sticking by the YTA after your every reply.", "They're grown ass adults, they can express their preference for themselves. And guess what, if the only reason they said they wanted both was so that your sister would feel appreciated that's actually a good and nice thing for them to care about. They don't need you to go \"no you're wrong you don't want that cake only use mine or I'll make a scene\"", "'consequences' and 'required my interference' wow you really do treat her like crap don't you", "I\u2019m sorry when did this become an opportunity for you to teach her a lesson? \n\nI\u2019ve read you\u2019re her sister\u2026 not her parent. Such an asshole", "Nah this is fair, its exactly the same reason I took all my nice and nephews pictures off the fridge and drew some better ones myself to replace them. Sure, they are 4 and 2, while I'm 35, but honestly their work was sloppy and I could tell my brother and his wife were just trying to appease them by putting them on the fridge.\n\nThey learned an important lesson about how serious they need to take art if they want it on the fridge.", "Parents are happy when kids do anything for them.

What the heck is wrong with you?", "\"Completely erases the hard work I put into this party\". It's not your party nor is it about you. The world doesn't revolve around you.\n\nYour parents did what good parents do and said, \"We want both cakes out\". It's not about a popularity contest and whose cake is better. With the way you talk, you should be on the Great British Bake Off and would win every round by a landslide.", "So you had a big screaming fit about how bad her cake was... and you're proud that after that, fewer people tried it?\n\nI can't help but think this is all about her taking attention away from you.", ">completely erases the hard work I put into this party. \n\nHow? What was erased? (Other than any respect the guests probably had for you prior to seeing your outburst)", "If you feel like you have to post on AITA, then you\u2019re admitting the downfall was on you too.", "Or maybe they are adults and speak for themselves but you assume they're toddlers when you disagree? \n\nI'd have eaten the cake with the curdled frosting. And i really love frosting.", "You\u2019re a spiteful, jealous AH", "Ffs, it was your parents 25th wedding anniversary. Not a baking competition", "Ding ding ding. Op you've just shown your true colours that you're jealous of your sister.\n\nThere's a bit of an age gap so of course your parents are going to try and \"appease\" her. She's still growing up and sometimes even if stuff goes horribly wrong we need a bit of parental love and guidance.", "There you go - your true asshole colors are showing now. Jealousy is a pretty green color isn't it? Instead of worrying about her, you should have been worried about the childish temper tantrum you threw. Glad to see you still feel superior over her 'unpopular' cake. \n\nSomeday, you'll grow up and hopefully, think back on this and then you'll realize you're the one who should be embarrassed.", "I can't eat as much as I want to vomit reading your words. Stop bring yo jealous of her. She's done nothing wrong. You're the older sister and should know and behave better and accordingly.", "Damn, your sister is not their little princess she's 13, tell me how you want to be the center of attention without saying it. YTA BIG TIME. So up in your ass, even when your parents asked you to take your cake you HAD to have your way bc it's your party right ? Everyone needs to praise your cake and you !", "I would be hurt if one of my sisters ever said something like this about me.YTA", "YIKES", "I mean, literally it was their party. They wanted her cake out. \n\nAnd oh, by the way, you\u2019re an adult. She\u2019s a child. You should be able to do things like bake better than she can. But you sure as shit shouldn\u2019t act like a smug asshole about it.", "Wow.  You just reinforced what an asshole you are.  Cake is not a source of \"popularity\".  It's supposed to be delicious and a source of *pleasure*.  No one even needs to have an Insta moment.  You eat it and celebrate someone's special whatever.", "She's a kid. You have issues and need a hobby", "What about the embarassment you forgot to notice for yourself? I guarantee your move at this party looked REALLY BAD to the guests and likely embarrassed your parents more than a bad cake ever could. You seem so \u2018concerned\u2019 that sister would have been embarrassed and forgot to take a moment to look at yourself. If anyone should be embarrassed it\u2019s you and I know those that witnessed this absolute pettiness are embarrassed on your behalf", "Okay, I get where you are coming from. I do. Have you read what you wrote about yourself? \"If my parents had let me do what I had originally planned ...\"you sound entitled and a wee bit jealous that they cater to her sometimes which is their right because they are her parents. If she had ended up with egg on her face then that would have been the fault of her and your parents. Instead by you commendeering the the cake situation YOU made yourself look spoiled and entitled.\n\nYTA", "Did they tell you your first attempts were garbage?  You have no idea of parental pride over may attempt for them.", "\u201cProbably\u201d. So you don\u2019t actually know.", "I can see why your sister isn't talking to you. You're a tedious narcissistic person - why did you even ask? No one agrees with you.", "But at least she wasn't asked to leave by the guests of honour because she was blowing up. I'd rather have an unpopular cake than that. I hope that was before the guests arrived or I feel so sorry for your parents.", "You talk about a cake being dense but you can\u2019t see that in yourself. Just wow. She\u2019s a child, you\u2019re 21, are you sure those ages are the right way round? You can\u2019t even accept in the comments that YTA despite everyone literally saying you are.

At all. It's a party for your parents to celebrate THEIR anniversary and THEY clearly told you they didn't want the cake replaced. When the people the event is for say \"we want that cake\" then that's the cake they should get", "If you wanted and planned on having complete control, including veto power, you should have made that known upfront to your family. Sister and parents. Otherwise you\u2019re just being a jerk to decide on your own what\u2019s \u201cworthy\u201d to be at the party after the fact. \n\nDo you recognize that your parents made a similar decision when they suggested that you leave?\n\nYou were basically a \u201cbad cake\u201d by being rude to your sister and hurting her feelings. And likely embarrassing them. \n\nHere\u2019s a bigger question: What would it have hurt to have both cakes or even just her cake there? Did you think it would reflect poorly on you or your family? Or are you a perfectionist who cannot handle anything you aren\u2019t in complete control of? (Sometimes it\u2019s hard yo recognize that kind of pattern until something like this blows up)", "Do you want us to celebrate you for doing that?", "Out of curiosity, how much money did you want your sister to contribute? It sounds like you wanted the party, that this was all for you. And I'm gonna guess the face you think your parents made about your sister's cake wasn't there at all. \n\nIt would not have killed you, to have your sister's cake there at the party next to yours. This wasn't a baking show.", "I'm sure they're way more unhappy about your behavior than they ever could be about a cake.", "I'm confused. You said you refused to put it out and put yours out instead, but then you said that your parents saw it and looked disappointed, and then they asked you to put both out. This doesn't really line up as a story.", "she's 13 years old for gods sake, and no it wasn't your party, you chose to spend that much time and money on it, that doesn't give you the right to dictate what happens at the party", "Sounds like you are putting yourself first by saying you know what people wanted just because you planned it.", "You're totally within your right to be an asshole, sure. As long as you know that's what you are for doing that.", "Perhaps that look on their face was because they saw how you treated your younger sister and her work and not the actual cake. \n\nAlso, people who are not AHs tend to utilize the saying of \"if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all\". Which means they weren't going to be giant jerks about a less than professional cake that was edible made by a 13 year old that was excited to be involved in the party. What kind of monster are you?!", "I guarantee that the look you think was \"unhappy about her cake\" was actually the look of parents that just had their adult daughter embarrass the crap out of them by acting like a selfish, jealous, toddler.", "At the party, the parents were most likely trying to keep the peace. I was trying to say she wanted to make sure they have the best cake.", "This exactly. This was a party. You and your sister are their children. I guarantee a party planner could have created an event better than you did but it doesn\u2019t matter because it was the thought that counts. Same for the cake. Quit competing with your sister. It\u2019s a homemade cake. Food Network isn\u2019t going to come calling here. There is nothing wrong with your sister baking a cake for this, curdled frosting included", "Right? What kind of 21 year old is constantly competing with their 13 year old sister? And before anyone tries to say siblings, my closest brother is 7 years older than me and he never tried to compete with me when he was an adult and I was a child", "So she put what she wanted over what the parents wanted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she's trying to have the best cake she lost because it is tainted with the memory oif what she did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow the parents 25th anniversary they can always remember how their eldest daughter slighted their youngest and went against what they wanted.", "My sister is 14 years older than me.
