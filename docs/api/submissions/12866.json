I am the baker of the family. My sister admires my skills and would often try to help out whenever I\u2019d bake. I moved out in November after getting married so my sister and I no longer work together in the kitchen. I do miss it because it's flattering that she admires me and likes to help, but she is less meticulous and often messes up small steps in the recipes.\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I told my sister I was planning on baking the cake for our parents\u2019 25th. She immediately suggested she make it herself since she has never gotten to before. I was hesitant but eventually agreed and requested that I at least help. She was ecstatic and refused to accept my help, and was insistent on making it entirely on her own, claiming her baking had improved. I was nervous but dropped the subject (a mistake).\n\nI called on Friday to ask her how the cake was going (the party was on Saturday), and she confided in me that it wasn\u2019t going as well as she wanted it to due to the frosting curdling. I immediately regretted letting her take over because I knew she was inexperienced. She said she was going to remake the frosting, but I was still uncertain of how this was going to turn out, so I decided I\u2019d take it in my hands to make a second cake on my own.\n\nOn Saturday everything was prepared, but my sister's cake honestly looked horrible. My sister didn\u2019t do as she promised and used the curdled frosting, claiming they were \u201cout of ingredients to make more\u201d. I appreciate the work she put into it and I know she means well but it was truthfully not in the least presentable. Because of this I brought my own cake that I had made the day before to the party and swapped out her cake with mine. My sister threw an absolute fit. This created an awkward situation for guests that were just arriving. I felt bad doing it but this was my parents\u2019 25th, and if my sister wasn\u2019t going to take the cake seriously I was within my right to replace it especially since I put more care into the one I made than she did. I know she is inexperienced but that is exactly why I should not have trusted her with this task in the first place. My parents are upset with me and suggested we serve both cakes but I refused. They asked that I either comply or I\u2019d need to leave for a bit and \u201ctake a breather\u201d. Their asking this made me blow up because I had more of a part in this than my sister. The only one on my side is my husband. My sister now is not speaking to me. I understand she worked hard on the cake but she should be understanding that her cake was not presentable. I feel I was within my right to swap out the cake but now I am unsure, aita?", "created_utc": 1679431620, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xtxxm/aita_for_replacing_the_anniversary_cake_my_sister/", "score": 216, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are so far up your own butt it's not even funny. You couldn't just let her make the cake and have the downfall be on her?

YTA. Your sister is 13 and desperately wants to be just like you by baking a cake for her parents, JUST LIKE YOU! All she does is look up to you and you squashed any self confidence she may have by telling her what she did isn't good enough.\n\nI hope you never have kids.", "YTA.\n\nYou took a moment and a memory away from your sister and parents because you wanted the limelight/adoration for whatever reason. You\u2019re putting her down for something she created, you should know better.", "YTA. Your little sister, who ~~idolizes~~ *idolized* you, baked an edible cake that didn\u2019t look as good as yours, **the professional baker**. You threw a fit because your parents wanted both the cakes. Here\u2019s a hint: *they were trying to appease **you**, not your sister*. You made their 25th anniversary all about you and your wants and needs, and also humiliated your sister in the process. Congratulations.", "YTA\n\nIt was not your place to swap the cakes. It sounds like the main problem with your sister's cake was the icing. Put both cakes out. People can scrape off the bad icing. Or you could offer your sister some replacement icing. Help her scrape off the old and put on new. But simply taking her cake was out of line.", "YTA!! Especially for ignoring your parents\u2019 wishes. It was THEIR anniversary, not yours. What made you think it was appropriate to blow up and act like a child in front of guests? OVER A CAKE?", "YTA no one came to that party to marvel at the cake. Way to ruin your parents\u2019 night.", "YTA - I mean, she was so excited and proud to make something for your parents doing her absolute best. I don\u2019t think you put more care into it.

Yeah, definitely TA. You could have helped her with the time you took to make your own cake.", "Who cares about the looks of the cake as it was made with love and affection by a daughter for her parents.

There is no reason both cakes couldn't have been offered. Even your parents - who were supposed to be the ones celebrated - asked you to comply with that request and you refused. Their event was not about you and your superior baking skill!", "YTA. Not everything has to be about perfection. Your sister did something nice and you ruined it over your own insecurities.  Who cares if the cake had curdled frosting, she did a good job for a 13 year old.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine doing that to my own sisters. You could have just told your sister, \u2018sounds like you have your hands full. Why don\u2019t I bring a cake as well and we can serve both?\u2019 Or  \u2018hey sis, how about we both just get a backup cake from the bakery if you can\u2019t get the icing right? Icing\u2019s hard, I made plenty of mistakes when doing it. Or I could just pay for the whole cake since you already done so much and I feel like I haven\u2019t contribute enough?\u2019 Or maybe not say or do anything other than, \u2018wow you really did a good job on the cake sis.\u2019", "YTA. What a cake tastes like is what matters, and there was no reason not to serve both cakes.", "YTA.  Your parents, whose party this was in honor of, wanted to serve both.  At their house.  This was not your place to refuse them that.", "YTA. If you knew she was going to mess it up, as her older sister, you should have been there to help her. Even if that is only being a bank to buy more supplies. Let her make the cake and instruct her how to do it or what ingredients she forgot.", "YTA. You're shitting on her because her cake doesn't look fantastic (and as nice as yours) for their 25th anniversary. She's 13 and I don't think I could've done that at her age. I don't see why you couldn't be ok with having both cakes served.", "yta\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...why did you have a cake ready to replace it in the first place?\n\nIt feels like you trusted your sister to fail so much that you put yourself on a high horse\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI agree with your parents, you should have served both. Your sister still made the cake out of love.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour husband is wrong, you slighted your whole family at one time by disrespecting your sister and disrespecting your parents wishes of serving both.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have a feeling your parents viewed your cake as unacceptable after you pulled this stunt. It would taste bitter from the energy you put into it.", "YTA, a lot I would suspect by your general demeanor.  You were an asshole when you made the cake betting on your sister's failure, and let's be clear, whether there was curdled icing or not, you made yours with the \"most care.\". You brought that cake intending to swap it out no matter what she made.\n\nYou arrived just late enough to do this in front of guests making you assholier.\n\nYou got upset because she got equal credit after both were served because you really like your cake the best.\n\nIt was awkward for everyone and your own Mom wanted you to leave.  But if you don't listen to ALL the people you know tell you you're an asshole, I am not sure me telling you will help stick the point.", "You know what, I missed the ages the first time around and thought YTA when we were talking about 2 grown sisters.\n\nNow that I realize she\u2019s 13? God, you are a massive AH.", "YTA. You could have just served both but you managed to make an occasion that was about your parents, to solely be about yourself and your baking skills. Clearly they were happy your sister made the effort.\n\nEdit to add: do you do this with other things as well? You should consider therapy to understand why you feel the need to make sure everything is perfect and undercut the people who don't abide by the same philosophy.", "YTA your parents wanted your sisters cake, you don't get to refuse anything, it wasn't your party and your condescending attitude towards your sister is unfair", "YTA. I get you're a baker, but you're taking this waaay to seriously. Your sister wanted to do something special on her own for your parents. You spoiled that for her, because you wanted every little detail to be perfect. But guess what? Things like that do not need to be perfect. This could have been a cute and maybe even funny thing to remember at later family gatherings, but no. Now this is a day that she and your parents will remember as a day where you could not let go of your passion for one day and spoiled the fun.", "I get that as a host or person in charge of planning something you want things to be perfect. But guests don't need everything to be perfect to have a good time. \n\nThe parents said it was fine to serve it so because of that...\n\nYTA.", "YTA - she might have failed but she put a lot of work into something that your parents wanted to see.

You made the day about you.", "YTA If it was edible, it should have been served.", "SHE\u2019S THIRTEEN. \n\nYTA.  \n\nDo you have any idea how many parents happily and proudly wolf down shitty meals because their kids made it for them? It\u2019s not about how it looks or even tastes, it\u2019s about the effort, it\u2019s about the fact that she badly wanted to do something nice for them!! And she did! \n\nThen you came along and ruined it. Ruined a perfectly normal and happy moment. Possibly tainted your sisters desire to learn to bake. Left a cloud of awkward and unhappyness over the entire event. And who the hell do you think you are that you refused to serve both cakes, even after your parents made it clear they would prefer that?\n\nYou just wanted to be the one that made the cake and got the credit.

If she needs this much control, she can plan her own anniversary party and have it be as rigid and un-fun as she likes.", "Maybe applause so she can tell people that *her* cake got applauded?", "I'm not sure it wasn't serviceable. \"Curdled\" frosting is still edible and tasty, just not as pretty. And considering how grossly competitive OP is with a literal child, I wouldn't trust her evaluation to be unbiased.", "Why should people get sick to please a 13 yo brat, though? I'm sorry, but no. She's now owed anything, and even less for people to eat what she made and get sick.\n\nYou're also assuming she refrigerated things properly, but I sincerely doubt it.", "It looks gross. Okay? They could have served both cakes but op refused because reasons. They just didn't want to have to share any of that I helped bake for this event spotlight. It's weird and op is absolutely the ah in this. It's not unsafe to hear it might not look nice but who cares? Probably not her family. Nobody is forcing them to eat it.", "And remember; OP is the baker of the family. Not her 13yo sister, oh no no no. OP is.", "If she didn't refrigerate the cake and frosting properly the frosting would melt. And cake itself can stay at room temp for a while anyway. Curdling in the case of frosting is not about spoilage as a previous commenter indicated. There is nothing for guests to get sick from.", "\ud83d\ude44 they won\u2019t get sick if the ingredients weren\u2019t spoiled to begin with. Just because there was a reaction doesn\u2019t mean the product was expired. If you have ever eaten cottage cheese, those are curdles too. Lots of real food has curdles in it. If it is expired and then state curdle that\u2019s a completely different thing.", "Curdling in frosting is cosmetic, and cakes are usually okay to sit out for a while because of the insanely high sugar content. The cake just didn\u2019t look very nice. No one was in danger.", "Again, just because the frosting curdled doesn't mean it's going to make anyone sick.  Sauces and the like very often curdle, or \"break,\" due to overheating.  It's not dangerous in the slightest.", "I wouldn't call her a brat, but... there is a reason why people value appearance in food. If the food looks good, it's more appealing to eat. If it looks messy, less so. \n\nI've been cooking food (seriously) for the last 10 years. For the first five, I focused on making sure the food tasted good, and that nothing was too spicy/salty/sweet, etc. For the last five, I've been working on my presentation. I want my food to look *and* taste good, too. \n\nBut to each their own I guess.", "L'il sis is trying to take my cake crown and I'm sulking about it. AITA?"]}
