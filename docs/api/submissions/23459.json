Our partners are also close. Our friend group overlap. My partner and I host a lot of parties, but our place is not very child-friendly. When my sister brings the kiddos, they usually end up creating a mess. A few weeks ago when they were over, the 6yo let our cats outside and the 4yo ruined our sofa. None of this was on purpose. They\u2019re kids, but I asked my sister to hire a sitter when she comes over next. She said that was unnecessary because I\u2019m their aunt and need to spend time with them. (I do feel bad about that. SO and I travel a lot.)\n\nI caved. Last night everyone came over for dinner, including the kids. I spent the whole night watching my nephews like a hawk, so anxious they would get hurt or break something. It was so bad that I had a full blown panic attack later, and my partner suggested I tell my sister how I\u2019m feeling.\n\nSo I did. I basically told her that I can\u2019t have the boys over anymore. She called me heartless and selfish and basically said that last night\u2019s dinner would probably be the last thing we do together aside from funerals and weddings.\n\nEdit: I do go to my sister\u2019s house.

She's a mom and doesn't want to come without her kids and you're not and don't want them there. Both ways are perfectly valid, but incompatible.

You shouldn\u2019t have been the one watching *her* kids like a hawk in your house\u2026that should have been her job as the parent, to make sure her group is not overburdening the host. Especially considering what happened the last time they came over. It\u2019s not just that the kids are present - they\u2019re present and not being properly managed.\n\nYou can say, I like to spend time with my nephews, but I can\u2019t even relax and enjoy the time because I\u2019m anxious about the kids being injured or about something being broken (and point to the previous examples). The fact that you had a panic attack after the dinner should be reason enough for your sister to know something needs to change. \n\nYou can ask if there\u2019s a way they can help reduce the things the kids can get into (have them come with a tablet, stay in one area, etc etc) - maybe the two of you can brainstorm a solution so she can monitor them more closely (or maybe bring someone else to help) so you can be less stressed. Otherwise, youre happy to interact with them at *her* house, but for your own sanity you may need to take a break from hosting the kids until perhaps they\u2019re older and it\u2019s less stressful for you. That\u2019s completely fair.", "NTA. If a child let my cats out, I would ban them from my house for quite some time.

Adults are entitled to kid free time, even, and often especially, parents. You shouldn\u2019t have to change your home to accommodate her kids, especially if she\u2019s unwilling to watch them. When it\u2019s just them and your sister, that\u2019s probably a lot more manageable, but when it\u2019s a group I think it\u2019s reasonable to say you\u2019re unwilling to add that stress. If you\u2019re willing to compromise on that, I think that\u2019s what I would tell her, \u201chey, I will still be open to having your family over to visit, and can\u2019t wait to visit at your home! But when I throw a gathering I\u2019m going to keep it adults only going forward. If this isn\u2019t something you can manage, I\u2019m going to ask that you don\u2019t attend. The additional responsibility for protecting my home and pets isn\u2019t something I\u2019m willing to add to my plate when hosting a group.

Many little boys tend to be rowdy, but the adults in charge need to teach them to be civilized.  Your sister is in a snit because she knows that she is in the wrong.  \n\nA normal person would be mortified at the damage to someone's couch, and why in the world would a child guest be playing/opening the door and letting cats out?  Neither of these actions could happen quickly - there was a lack of responsible supervision.\n\n*last night\u2019s dinner would probably be the last thing we do together*\n\nRejoice for now at this statement.

If these are dinner parties and she's the only one bringing children then I would say you're well within your rights to limit it to adults. Family dinners are different.", "I was going to say YTA, but the fact that they let your cat out and ruined your sofa is 100% reason enough not to let them over.

You can treat your house like a cold model home and make sure it's always perfect by keeping kids out if you wish. But if there is some weird dynamic where you can't/won't go to sisters house, then I understand why she's upset. She thinks you don't really like her kids or enjoy spending time with them, and that hurts.\n\nAlso, remember that your \"get a sitter\" request is entirely reasonable. However, if you see each other very often, then you can't expect that she will get a sitter all the time to see YOU. Her kids come first. She genuinely prefers spending her time with them. A lot of childfree people don't realise this, and will make comments about how parents should \"take a break\", have \"adult time\", etc-that's very rude. Especially as most parents work outside the home. Time with your kids is precious.", "NTA\n\nYour house is not kid friendly.  You don\u2019t NEED to spend time with them.
