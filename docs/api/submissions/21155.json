In this case you should not have ordered sweets. You will get some on terahvi. But you are still not ah. But it should not have been an issue if you are living in your own house. U have not mentioned your age but life experience comes with age. NTA. My dad passed away at 78 and we did shanti paath after 2 days and everyone got sweets. Everyone behaved normally but that probably has a lot to do with the deceased's age\nETA- also your father is wrong to say he cant pray before terahvi.

If so, I'm not on board with that and the cultural expectation can disappear as far as I'm concerned. There's a massive, truly gigantic difference between eating cake at home and throwing a party or celebrating. Until your father eats dry crackers and tepid water throughout the mourning period, some other person can claim the same thing. How dare you have sugar in your tea, I'm in mourning. How dare you have cream in your coffee, why not just book a vacation cruise, you insensitive SOB.

In American culture dessert can be considered celebratory, but is also used often as a \u201ccomfort food\u201d, I\u2019ve noticed it\u2019s an unconscious tradition for me to buy an unreasonable amount of jelly beans when someone in my life dies, it\u2019s comforting and I find myself craving them when I\u2019m sad about bad things, whether it be death, friendship or relationship conflicts, or difficult job circumstances. Maybe just try to do it more discreetly to allow your father his religious and cultural observance, and get something that is less associated with celebration. It\u2019s fairly normal to crave things that give you positive feelings in times of sadness.
