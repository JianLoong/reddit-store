However, this is entirely subjective to the cultural reference. I do not know enough of your cultural expectations to adequately answer this. From the perspective of a fairly well traveled American, I haven't experienced a culture in which this would be a reasonable response or expectation. However, it could change depending on the cultural norms of where you live and whether it was reasonable for you to be aware of this.", "There are a lot of cultural assumptions in here.\n\nIt is clear from your post that your father thinks it's not appropriate to eat sweet things during a mourning period. Obviously your father was closer to his brother-in-law than you were, so he's going to be more sensitive about anything surrounding the mourning period, particularly given that he was a relatively young man when he unexpectedly died.\n\nI don't know enough about what I would expect from a Hindu household to know whether you're the asshole here or not.

I don't see why your diet must change because somebody passed away. That's like saying if someone was injured in a car accident nobody can drive to the hospital they're in.", "I am of your culture. I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say you\u2019re an AH, but definitely insensitive. \n\nYou seem to understand the context here though and just made a mistake. You had a craving, the time was inappropriate, humans have more self control than to satisfy cravings at inopportune moments. Good reminder and now time to move on from it.", "You seem to have a good understanding of the Hindu culture and when ordering dessert/sweet is appropriate.
