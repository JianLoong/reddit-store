Your father probably doesn\u2019t even realize that indulging in dessert is one of the most stereotypical \u201ccoping mechanisms\u201d that many people use when they\u2019re dealing with immediate grief. Either way, your food choices have absolutely nothing to do with how you feel about your uncle\u2019s passing and it is not at all \u201ccelebrating\u201d. I\u2019m sure your dad is just being like this because he\u2019s suffering emotionally, but it\u2019s not fair to you to make you walk on eggshells about what you\u2019re eating.", "Your uncle was only in his fifties when he died, maybe thats why your fathers response seems a little excessive.  Also, its not clear if you were living in the bereaved family's house or in a separate house (if living in india, its entirely possible you were in the family's house with all the extended family until terahvi) . In this case you should not have ordered sweets. You will get some on terahvi. But you are still not ah. But it should not have been an issue if you are living in your own house. U have not mentioned your age but life experience comes with age. NTA. My dad passed away at 78 and we did shanti paath after 2 days and everyone got sweets. Everyone behaved normally but that probably has a lot to do with the deceased's age\nETA- also your father is wrong to say he cant pray before terahvi. Your aunt belongs to a different family according to hindu tradition. People of the deceased's family cant pray ie- his parents, brothers, brother's wife, unmarried sisters, and children", "NTA when I am mourning I eat sweets as a comfort", "NTA, but I would cut your dad some slack.  It sounds like his own grief is hitting him hard.", "NTA dads a little much", "INFO: I think we need more information about your cultural practices and expectations around mourning. Like you say you \u201cordered\u201d dessert so I assume you were eating out somewhere? To me eating out is usually done for a celebration and is not an everyday occasion, so it seems odd to me that your family is fine with eating out but not with ordering dessert. But again maybe there are some cultural expectations I don\u2019t know about.", "NTA.  Based on your comments and the Hindu lady who provided context.  \n\nYour father has drawn his own personal line about the festivities custom. And while you didn't understand or agree with it, you respected the situation enough to not order dessert.  \n\nYour father is close in age to your uncle most likely.  There may be a depth to his grief you don't realize if they were close and/or he's feeling his own mortality now. \n\nAnd sometimes,  grief and sadness cause people to be off their normal personality. People say and do things in these situations they might not do normally.", "nta... wierd ettiqutte to have.\n\nIf I die,... id rather people morn me in a party type atmosphere,.. happy with the memories.", "NTA. \n\n>sweets are culturally associated with celebrations\n\nI don't know enough about your country's culture to dispute this, but I will say that there are cultures in which sweet foods are a part of mourning rituals and where deserts are served at funerals. \n\nYour father is a bit sensitive at the moment. Hopefully, with time and support, he can accept that life goes on for the living. \n\nAnyway, I'm sorry for your family's loss.", "Um comfort foods include desserts. NTA.", "Take this with a grain of salt since I'm not Hindu, but to me this isn't insensitive. Is the expectation that you cut out everything desirable during the time of mourning? If so, I'm not on board with that and the cultural expectation can disappear as far as I'm concerned. There's a massive, truly gigantic difference between eating cake at home and throwing a party or celebrating. Until your father eats dry crackers and tepid water throughout the mourning period, some other person can claim the same thing. How dare you have sugar in your tea, I'm in mourning. How dare you have cream in your coffee, why not just book a vacation cruise, you insensitive SOB. Then, even if he DOES have dray crackers and tepid water, some AH will come along and say he's being disrespectful because they're salted crackers. Or how dare he even *have* water when the deceased can't partake as well.\n\nI'm going with NTA. It's cake in your home, not being flaunted. It's not a party. It's not you shouting YAHOO IT'S GREAT TO BE ALIVE. It's. A. Freaking. Dessert. That's it. If they take meaning beyond that from it, then to me that's on them, and you can tell your father that he's the one being insensitive to your way of mourning, which is raising a slice of cake for the deceased now that they can no longer have one.", "You were insensitive and disrespectful to the period of mourning for the death of a close ( ish) relative. You didn\u2019t consider how your father might be feeling, grieving. If you wanted it so bad you could have gone out to eat it by yourself. YTA. This is from someone who\u2019s well versed with the cultural significance of both desserts being celebratory in India, and the expectations around mourning ( simple food, simple clothes and muted conversations etc).

Shame on you!", "Tell him to suck silicone rooster", "Come on, bulldog - OP had already explained this was in India. Sweets have different connotations there. So whilst OP isn't necessarily wrong, to order sweets - her father isn't 'odd', because he lives in a different culture to us. \n\nI'd personally say NAH. OP can order sweets for private use, during this mourning period. And perhaps he was being a tad bit unreasonable, telling her off.

Not because it\u2019s a celebration, desserts to not equal celebration.", "We don't live in the same house and I am 19.

My family is fine with food being delivered (items like pizza which I don't find very different from dessert personally as they are both made to satisfy cravings) so I didn't think this would be an issue but my dad drew the line at dessert since sweets are a part of celebrations here.

I just felt a craving and didn't think it through very well.", "This sub isn't exclusive to Westerners. \nAnd no, I did not know we were observing this.
