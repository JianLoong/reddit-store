I was injury free but idk what would've happened without the helmet. Also eye wear bc sunburning your eyes is NOT fun. \n\nanyway, these activities are supposed to be fun. if you want your cute matching snow suit and full faced makeup go for it. If you just wanna take the bunny slopes because you're scared of the big ones GO FOR IT. If you want to be covered head to toe in snow gear because one spec of cold will ruin your day GO FOR IT. If someone makes fun of you, they aren't worth your time and frankly, I wouldn't be friends with someone who makes fun of random people.. well any people, but that whole snicker at strangers thing really irks me. My ex did that and I couldn't STAND it. \n\nYour \"friend\" is a gross human being. I would end that friendship in a second.

Unfortunately, she is picking on others and channeling energy away from her sport. \n\nI think you did the right thing by pulling her aside and calling her out, even though it has caused some conflict in the gc.

Maybe deep inside, she is insecure (happens to us a lot). Maybe she has a crush on one of the guys...and just wants a bit of validation. Either way, it was wrong of her.\n\nBut what u did is even worse imo. According to judgement bot, u called her a pick me in FRONT OF EVERYONE! Like what sort of a well wisher embarasses a friend like this in front of others... especially if one of the guys were indeed her crush. Are u really a friend?\n\nSecondly, u are calling your 'friend\" a pick me. But u never said anything abt the same guys, who were LAUGHING at her jokes before, didn't shy away from also making a move on the ski gal?

This is a really messed up way to think eh\n\nIn conclusion, Amy was mean but she didn't do it on ski gal's (a stranger) face.\nU, on the other hand humiliated her (your 'friend') in public...instead of advising in private. \nAnd the guys aren't that great as well.\n\nYa all annoying.

White ski suits are dangerous for everybody else because they\u2019re very hard to see.\nSure you do you, and it\u2019s really unnecessary to hate on them all the time, but to be fair most people who are good skiers wouldn\u2019t wear those kind of outfits. \nIf you want to flex with your expensive ski wear, at least buy something that actually makes sense for skiing and not something that\u2019s only there for fashion.\n\nBadmouthing people is a shitty trait though, it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a truth to it.\nTelling her \u201ethose guys will always go for the Bogner cute girl\u201c however is a ridiculously stupid take it itself.
