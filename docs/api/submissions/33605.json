I have sacrificed too many ski days to count just showing my friends the ropes on the mountain, and it's all worth it when I see them linking turns! \n\nAlso, I highly suggest skiing first. You can snowboard after, but the first day (really the first few days, maybe even first full season) is always way better on skis. The first few days on a snowboard are the best workout you'll ever get, because you've never had to get up that many times in full winter gear attached to a heavy board!", "it does if they do it in a shitty way", "They\u2019re not getting flack because they\u2019re not the ones initiating this talk. It wouldn\u2019t do much good to pull each of them aside and try to talk them out of laughing at this girl\u2019s mean comments. If you\u2019re going to intervene, it makes sense to intervene at the source.", "Men will mock, belittle, and berate the very women they want to sleep with/date. Go figure.", "YOU sound insufferable. Definitely an ESH situation", "OP sounds more like the pick-me honestly. Her friend just sounds like an insecure asshole. OP is the one saying \u201cguys only like pretty girls in make-up they aren\u2019t going to choose you\u201d + I\u2019d bet she is taking personal offense to the jokes friend is cracking and doesn\u2019t actually care about the girlies as much as she cares about putting down another woman in front of a group of men.", "The people who matter won't mind. The people who mind don't matter.", "I joined the r/skigear and r/skiing subs to get more into talking to others about it and hoo boy, it sure is gate-keepy over there. But from what I\u2019ve seen, this behavior is only online and I\u2019ve never experienced it at the mountain. We all were beginners at one point.", "The only time people care is if someone is bombing down hills above their ability level. But that\u2019s really only because it puts other skiers in danger", "It's like the gym, the vast majority of people are looking to do their own thing or are amped to see a new person joining in. It's the small majority that are AHs.", "Trust me, if those kids grew up skiing they\u2019ve seen much worse. Everybody falls, the only time I\u2019ve seen people actually get really mad at a new skier is when this guy who was clearly not experienced enough tried to hit a fairly big jump kicker.\n\nMultiple people warned him not to do it (including a few little kids haha), but he still chose to and of course ended up breaking his leg. The entire park was shut down for like 30 minutes while ski control got him out of there", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

If they laugh, they are endorsing what she's saying. \n\nThey are only a tiny bit better than she is. And you don't know what they say when OP isn't around. Why do you think the girl was so comfortable making those remarks around them?", "Yes because a comment that describes someone\u2019s behavior can be twisted into a sexist take, meanwhile the person saying it, is also a female.  The OP pulled her friend aside, that\u2019s the correct way to handle it.\n\nI\u2019m sure people just love hanging out with you.", "Or it\u2019s just saying it doesn\u2019t have to always be about you.  Shit a guy could be a pick me too.  Weird way to attribute sexism to a comment clearly not sexist.", "I feel like there is an opposite gender term for the behaviour which is \"nice guy\".", "It\u2019s also funny because OP is kinda being a pick me too \u201cthese guys will never like you they only like pretty girls sorry\u201d", "She pulled her friend to the side\u2026", "I can guarantee you it's just online. People suck online and i wouldn't bother with finding a subreddit. Just find a couple good YouTube videos and you'll be set. Can't help you with which i only watch snowboarders. Steepsteep is the only skier on youtube I know", "She may not have asked, but she feels comfortable enough judging others, why should she be immune? Asking for an apology on behalf of someone else, especially a poorly behaved complete stranger, is a little ridiculous.", "If you mean yourself, then yeah, you did ask to be judged because you commented in a forum about opinions and their judgement. Giving your view does not absolve you from the consequences. \n\nIf you mean OP, then they ended with a question asking if they are TA, so yeah, they\u2019re asking for a judgement.\n\nIf you mean Amy, then no, no one asked her for her judgement, which was my point.", "She was judging people for how they looked.  We are judging her based on her actions and words.  Do you seriously not understand the difference?", "Just like the people that the other girl is judging ALSO didn\u2019t ask to be judged, yet OP\u2019s friend judges them anyways. Do YOU understand?", "I\u2019m really not sure what you\u2019re arguing, here.\n\nIs OP somehow in the wrong if she doesn\u2019t have a Stern Talk with each and every member of this group? Or are you just upset that the comments are not more focused on the people who laughed than on the person who made mean comments? Like\u2026what is actually pissing you off here, and what do you feel you\u2019re accomplishing?", "Maybe the guys are laughing because they are embarrassed at what is being said, but don't know how to shut it down. \n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "by definition, a pick-me is who degrades their own gender in order to come of as \"better and more quirky\" than them, and get male validation.\n\nop's friend's the one mocking the other girls tryna appeal to males\u2014 not op.", "Yeah that\u2019s not a pull someone aside in public issue. That\u2019s a sit down and talk in private like adults issue. \n\nShe obviously just wanted to humiliate this girl back. They both suck and want drama more than they want to be friends.", "Trying to sleep with someone you don't respect is a sign of poor character.", "That\u2019s good to know! I\u2019ve been skiing since I could walk but never really integrated myself into the community, which I\u2019m hoping to change because who doesn\u2019t want more friends who ski?! But yikes, those subs really do pick apart riders who do so little as wear the wrong gear.", "ok you said it was ok because it was solicited. now youre changing your story?\n\nwhat happened to solicited? since it wasnt solicited and you realize you messed up your excuse, you just act like it dont matter.\n\nyoure judging people unsolicited the exact same behavior your yelling about.", "Choosing clothes is an action. Now what?", "Nah, she could have just said something in the moment in front of all of them and made a stance. \nThen it's fair game. Waiting till later on is a sneaky way to get a one up for some strangers you don't know.", "They are enablers at best then? Don't know why they'd be friends with someone who embarrasses them.", "Who says they don\u2019t respect them?  They laughed at some jealous girls joke.  Might not have wanted to make a big deal out of it\u2026", "Just get on the slopes and strike up a conversation on the lift. Always a chance to meet fun people. Even if it's just for a couple minutes. At least that's how I experience it in the Alps here", "I'm not the OP from the first comment lol", "Buddy, are you okay?", "weird ass hill to die on bro", "I dunno how many group scoldings you\u2019ve attempted, but they tend not to be terribly effective. The likely outcome there is that OP gets ganged up on and ends up feeling like an idiot.", "Maybe.\n \nI don't know why they would be friends with embarrassing people either. I don't understand people being friends/in relationships with bullies & abusers, but they are.", "Well, in my opinion it's inappropriate and bad behavior to mock a friend/traveling companion behind their back, or participate in such mocking. The least the guys could have done would have been to not laugh at her mean jokes.", "Are you? Do you have an on topic response? Use your words", "The whole topic of the thread is judging people. So no its not weird", "I have attempted some. They are mostly awkward, but if you're in the right, you can only look self-righteous, not an idiot. \n\nI think the reaction would be that she is right that you shouldn't mock strangers behind their backs to get some laughs, but OP is a buzzkill. That's the real juice.", "Certain people like to stick together. Which is my whole point. ESH", "They weren\u2019t friends, looks like they were random people..", "I\u2019m fine, thanks. I also just woke up to a wild domino chain of you demanding an apology from me (el oh el) and then raging at another person who *wasn\u2019t* me\u2014 because I guess reading the names you\u2019re replying to before you go on a tirade is a lot to ask? Be blessed.", "exactly why it\u2019s weird for u to act like no judgement can be placed.  get outta here weirdo.", "Familiar or not, mocking people is a sign of disrespect."]}
