I don't drink, so I am always chosen as the driver.\n\nAfter about 3 rounds of drinks, a conversation about K-Pop started. We're all really into music, so we often talk about things like this.\n\nI was asked for my opinion on K-Pop, to which I said I wasn't fond of it, because a lot of it felt too manufactured, plus I find it really hard to connect with music in another language. I also mentioned that I had nothing against K-Pop or its fans, I just wasn't fond of it myself.\nI want to make it clear, I have nothing against Koreans or their culture or whatever. I just don't like most K-Pop.\n\nImmediately, two of my friends started scoffing and calling me a racist, and that it was to be expected considering my home nation (I am Indian for context).\nThese two have always been a bit weird with me, guess I know why now.\n\nI immediately got annoyed and asked them what they meant by that.\n\nThey said something about how Indians are racist towards other Asians (which is true for some Indians, but certainly not all!) and how as Asians they were just waiting for a racist comment from me.\n\nI asked them how not liking K-Pop was racist, and they told me that it was \"obvious\" that I didn't like it because it's Korean. They then started insulting me, calling me a racist very loudly, attracting the attention of other people in the restaurant. They also called me slutty and feminine because I'm bisexual and I had nail polish on.\n\nThe other two told them to calm down, and they just didn't listen. This went on for 5 minutes. I was having none of it, called them out for THEIR racist bullshit about me eventually saying something because I'm Indian, and their homophobic nonsense, and finished with telling them that they were being ridiculous and childish, and left.\n\nThe next morning, I got texts from all of them, calling me an AH for leaving them without a designated driver. The two friends who didn't call me racist, said they understood why I left, but still called me an AH for leaving them without a designated driver. They all got home safely in one piece of course, they all just got a taxi (the bar has a little agreement with taxis in the area so that it's easier for drunk people to get a ride, and we all live in the same street because of college) and went home.\n\nI don't feel bad for saying I don't like K-Pop or leaving the two who called me racist.  I feel bad about leaving my other friends behind, since they are quite nice and weren't involved, but I also couldn't stand another minute of the other two's nonsense.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673794623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10clsjn/aita_for_leaving_my_friends_at_a_bar_with_no/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly I just wouldn't talk to them for a while. They admitted themselves they didn't like you and were specifically waiting for the right moment to start an argument with you. Not friends.", "NTA. Sounds like they were baiting you. And doesn\u2019t sound like very nice friends.

Every Asian race hates the other Asians (alot of bad history). That'd be like saying I'm racist for not liking chicken and waffles. (I do like them). Or I'm culturally appropriating because when I go out for sushi I use chop sticks and my wife keeps my sake cup full, or the fact that I'm white but named my oldest son Ryu and my youngest son Turok. I've even seen white people getting called racist for knowing or learning different languages like Spanish or mandarin.", "NTA. They really need to be educated on how ignorant they are. They are judging you based off your race when you had a clear and logical reason for not enjoying K-pop.

The fact that they denounced you as racist and then employed racist tropes to justify their inane arguments is a giant red flag. Plus slut-shaming and making fun of you because of your sexual orientation. And is there anything wrong with wearing fingernail polish? What\u2019s next? Denounce you for eating curry sauce on fries? You don\u2019t need this shit. I swear they are using you as a free car service.

Definitely a bad move on my part.", "I'm not mad at them to be honest, I asked them why they didn't do anything, and they both Saud they were really unsure what to do and didn't want to create a scene.

Maybe they never liked me, which is a sad, sad thought, but one that needs to be had.", "Also, stereotyping you by saying that \"Indians are racist\" is itself a racist sentiment and their lack of seeing the irony is astounding.", "but that still doesn't mean you didn't have the right to refuse them 'service' after they've disrespected you that much. sounds like they really aren't your friends.", "Don\u2019t let them find out..
