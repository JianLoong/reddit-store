I've never posted here before, but I just need to get some things off my chest and maybe gain some clarity. I'm going to make this brief and not go into too much detail because it'll be a novel if I do.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nMy older sibling (I'll call her Cee) has three kids (2, 4 & 7). Me and my mother babysit them most of the week (three days a week) and weekend (sometimes Saturday and all day Sunday) since Cee doesn't want to put them in day care and \"would rather them be with family\". The father of the kids is at their house but doesn't really do anything. He doesn't work, doesn't help around the house and doesn't really do much besides gaming. My sibling works so that's when we do most of the babysitting. So long story-short, we are doing most of the work for free because the father can't be bothered to do it and my sibling doesn't want to do daycare. It's a difficult situation because my mom cares and wants to help, as do I, but it's not what we prefer and it takes a toll on both of us. For additional context, I work fulltime (also get paid to do a passion of mine at home on certain days each week) so I help out when I get off (assuming it's a babysitting day) and on the weekends.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nWell, I finally have two days off this week and yesterday (one of my days off) I was stuck helping babysit. I let it go because it's nothing new. Well today is one of my last days off for a bit and it's also the day we don't have the kids today. So I planned to get things done. Well, not long after I woke up, Cee called me and asked if I could keep one of the kids for an hour while she takes the other two to the doctor. I, at first, was ready to say \"Yeah I can\", but I didn't want to. I felt tired and a bit down after seeing that she wanted me to babysit on my last day off, even if it's for an hour. The thing that made me want to give in was the fact that it was for a doctor visit for her youngest child. Then I started to to mention \"Why can't their dad babysit, he's right there?\" Then she got snippy with me and just said \"nevermind, forget it\". I reached out through text to say I'm sorry but I just had plans today and it's my last day off, but she is ignoring me now.\r  \n\r  \nI'm feeling terrible. I feel like I should have just said yes, but I babysit so much already and I work all the time. I just want a break today. AITA for saying no? Should I have just said yes and done it?", "created_utc": 1687279196, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14eg08m/aita_for_saying_no_when_asked_to_babysit/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Time for you and your mum to put your feet down and say no.", "NTA- your sister doesn't want to *pay* for daycare.  Preferring to have the kids stay with family is a thing people say to avoid paying you.  \n\nI would decline to do any babysitting if I'm not getting paid at least $15/hr.  and if she's going to have attitude when you're not available $20/hr.

She picked this prize, not you.", "NTA - her anger is misdirected. It should be toward the father of her children. You shouldn\u2019t have to play stepmother because her husband is lousy. How about she expect/demand more of him rather than requiring her family to pick up the slack??

He would be being a fucking dad. The fact that the mother lets him get away with this is insane, and you are enabling her behavior, which is also insane. Stop it.", "NTA.

You are in no way obligated to babysit for them regardless of the reasons. Not your problem. Not your choice to have multiple children with what sounds like the biggest loser. \nThe fact that you help out at all is very kind and should be appreciated.", "NTA\n\nAnd that snippy response from her says to me that it's likely a common argument with her and her husband about why he won't step up and watch his own kids. She got snippy with you because she doesn't have a good answer beyond, \"Because he just won't,\" and she *knows* that's a shit answer. Because he's acting like a shit.\n\nIt's kind of you to babysit so often. But they are HER kids. And her marriage.

Let him raise his own kids. And you sister needs to get her head of get behind and appreciate the time you already spent babysitting her kids for free.

You're already babysitting a lot. That was your last day off for a while and you deserve to enjoy it and yourself without being a free babysitter.

You stood your ground, you respected yourself. If she can't understand that, it's on her. She's already lucky to have free childcare from you and your mother 4 to 5 days a week. She should either dump her lazyass boyfriend or force him to care for his kids.

Where does she get off expecting you and your mom to plan your lives around her responsibilities and expecting nothing from her children's father?  She has obviously been taking advantage of you and your mother for years and both of you somehow think you cannot set boundaries with her.  It is past time to stand up for yourselves.  Good grief, helping is one thing and you have clearly been wonderful to help, but her expecting you to be her slave is not.  She clearly thinks only of herself and what she wants.  In fact, she should be so very grateful and appreciative to you and your mom.  Do NOT let her guilt you into not being available every time she chooses to ask you for something.  She is not respecting you or your life at all and this needs to stop as it's not fair to you.", "NTA but you and your mom need to grow a backbone and lay down the law.\n\nYour sister chose to have 3 kids with a useless loser.
