They do not care whether or not their use of these symbols/practices are done in an inappropriate and/or offensive manner, or whether or not they are misrepresenting them, because they consider it all \"up for grabs\" anyway.

OPs gf is from a small religious group that views *every single religious symbol and text as their own.* Sounds like someone who wouldn't have any qualms about cultural appropriation and would also be entirely willing to advertise that fact in public through her personal adornments.

Cultural appropriation, then.", "In many Indian families married women are supposed to wear the bindi; independent of if they are white or Hindu themselves.

If you travel/live as a white woman in India, you will receive 9 out of 10 times more respect if you show up somewhere in a salwar or a kurta or a saree, as if you show up in jeans and tank top.

It was just an example provided by the original commentator of the difference between iconography and things that have depth and meaning.\n\nEdit; and the person asking was specifically asking about the bindi in reference to the original commentator. I was just providing context of what that commentator meant by using the bindi as an example and not what the following commentator thought of bindi's having racist history.", "Right, but in this example if she wore a bindi it wouldn't be because of knowledge of the culture or respect. There is a huge difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation which I will admit gets lost on some people. But this particular woman is a white woman, I assume in America, who's not married, who doesn't know anything about the culture or religion, and that strays away from cultural appreciation into seeing someone's culture as only a fashion statement without understanding the importance of what they're wearing or it's weight in the culture they are refusing to learn about. That would be the issue in this particular circumstance. And how doing that is very different than wearing a cross necklace or a pentagram ring for example. \n\nThe idea of cultural appropriation in America is that it's steeped in ignorance and doesn't come from respect, understanding, or appreciation of the culture/religion but is used as a fashion statement and thus becomes a caricature.", "I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t use common sense, I\u2019m saying that people whose symbols have been misappropriated aren\u2019t wrong for wearing them, and that they are in fact neutral. \n\nNo, life doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, ergo, folks don\u2019t tend to wear swastikas to job interviews, at least in the west. They\u2019re all over the place in India. Things are  viewed differently in different places, we all know this. But instantly decrying a particular religious symbol as bad (like OP is saying about Nordic religious symbols) because they\u2019ve been misappropriated by shitty people whose views absolutely do not represent the religion as a whole, is reductive and harmful. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to point out.", "But the point is when you see a white woman with a Salwar and a bindi walk across the street in Manhattan, you have absolutely 0 idea about her involvement or lack of involvement in Indian culture.

If she was doing this, her partner would know and this would be in the right to say something. This isn't about some random stranger saying something's appropriation. A random person wouldn't because they don't know, I agree with you. But her partner would know and then would be in the right to bring it up *if* she went that far. Which the original commentator is saying, it would be worth bringing up if it went that far but it hasn't, so he should chill.\n\nEdit; again the bindi was an example, not something she is currently doing.", "**I'm going to go against the grain and say that OP is NTA**. I'm not sure whether OP's gf is an AH. However, based on what I know of certain New-Age and Neopagan movements (started by and mostly practiced by people of privilege within dominant cultures), that religious groups can of themselves perpetrate cultural appropriation.\n\nCultural appropriation is when members of a dominant cultural group appropriate aspects of a marginilized group's culture in a way that is misleading or offensive or even unacknowledged. Whether or not that appropriation has a spiritual veneer around it is hardly relevant. As I've said on this thread before, ~~and have in turn recieved some backlash~~, people from marginilized cultural groups often *do* get upset by the innapropriate use of their symbols by outsiders. Your gf does not seem the type to consider whether or not her use of these symbols might be offensive, since they all belonged to her religious group anyway and she is re-\"claiming\" them, but I may be wrong. **EDIT:** Also, you should ask her if she is aware of cultural appropriation and how it works (if you haven't already) and whether or not she has fully considered whether or not she is engaging in it. Ask her if she is aware of how cultural appropriation can even be perpertated by religious groups themselves. I have described how that can go down elsewhere on this thread.\n\n**OP I'm going to give you some advice.** ~~Reddit is not the best place to ask this question. It is filled with many people from who often do not take cultural appropriation (or really even the religious beliefs of other people) seriously.~~  **EDIT: I should probably not generalize people myself like that. I'm not perfect either.** Obviously that does not describe every redditor, but I will take the downvotes bc I want you to heed my advice: you cannot control what your gf wears, and you do not want to be a controlling partner. However, *you* clearly care about respecting other people's belief systems, and get frequent second hand embarresment by the situations your gf puts you in.\n\nSince you cannot actually control your gf's wardrobe, two things need to happen. You really need to sit down and make sure your gf understands **why** you feel her behavior is problematic. Make sure you are understood. However, if you are understood and she does not want to change (and she has the right) then you need to ask yourself this question: are these incidents, involving your gf offending people, worth the relationship? If they are, you need to just let it go. You're not going to change someone who doesn't want to change, and you shouldn't try because it leads to weird power-dynamics and stuff. You can't try and parent your SO. On the other hand, if these incidents are NOT worth the relationship, you should probably consider ending it.", "I wouldn't necessarily say you're being an asshole. It is a fine line between trying to help someone and trying to change them.  If she wears religious artifacts because she truly believes she is an adherent of all faiths, then that's her prerogative.  If, on the other hand, she is acting kind of weird because she came from and emotionally abusive out of touch cult then helping her to leave that behind may be helpful.  So - its nuanced.  But, if your only concern is that you don't like the aesthetics or unusual nature of her adornements, and you want her to change for your comfort level, than that's probably not great.", "YTA.

All with the support of various churches.\n\nThis is fortunately not the case in the current era but the seeds that grew the Holocaust were planted by the Church in the middle ages.\n\nEveryone talks about the Spanish inquisition which was an official act of the Catholic Church but there were inquisitions in many European countries. England was actually the first country to have an inquisition and expel us and many western European countries followed suit over the next 200 years which partially explains why there were more Jews in Poland or Russia individually than all of western Europe combined. Germany and Austria-Hungary which were \"central\" Europe at that time had a decent sized population as well.\n\nThere are also historical accounts of the crusaders murdering Jews on their way to the holy land. The crusades were decreed by the Pope. They were killing us in the name of God! Deus volt! God wills it!\n\nThen in Russia we were second class citizens. We were made to live in shtetls which were like villages just for Jews. Eventually there was a czar who thought, \"no one cares about the Jews and I'd like that land to be used differently\" and we got the shit pogrommed out of us. They would decide to give the town to someone else and send in the cossacks to rape and pillage and drive us out. My grandfather's ancestors left the Russian empire in the late 1800s because they didn't want to stay and be killed. Bet your bottom dollar that the villages were given to Christians once they were \"cleansed\" of the Jews.\n\nIn 1930 there were 3 million Jews in Poland including my grandmother's extended family. They were killed to a person. 10 out of every 11 Polish Jews were killed. Of my relatives, only my great grandfather and his two brothers got out in time.\n\nAnd even then, anti semitism is always rearing its ugly head.\n\nI'll still never forget when my protestant friend in elementary school told me he didn't want to be friends anymore because I killed Jesus. We were eight years old.\n\nNot the Romans killed Jesus. Not Pontius Pilate. Not Longinus killed Jesus. No, the Jews, apparently we killed him and we're bastards forever for this.\n\nTurned out his church had held a passion play for Easter and the pastor had shared some choice opinions about us members of the tribe.\n\nSo you'll have to excuse me for feeling this way but a cross and star of David together would make my blood boil.", "It's completely different scenarios to wear culturally appropriate clothing while traveling in a country vs wearing ethnic clothing to a 100% white music festival so you can feel exotic while partying.\n\nNo one is saying it's cultural appropriation to wear a bindi if you're traveling in India m they're saying it's racist to wear it as a Halloween costume or to a rave when you're a white person who knows nothing about the culture it comes from", "Thats..... disgusting", "YTA.
