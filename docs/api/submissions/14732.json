They do not care whether or not their use of these symbols/practices are done in an inappropriate and/or offensive manner, or whether or not they are misrepresenting them, because they consider it all \"up for grabs\" anyway.

Sure. But that work does not entail making you like who that person really is. \n\nYou are supposed to like your partner first. They should be the person you feel the most comfortable with. This isn\u2019t about attraction. Attraction can fade. But if you love the person AND like the person\u2026 that should be the goal. \n\nOP, you don\u2019t seem to feel comfortable with this girl, her beliefs, and how she expresses them. Whatever feels like \u201clove\u201d to you right now might not be that. It might be love and caring, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily equate a good partner for you.", "I don't know, it feels weird to me too, but I guess I'd go NAH.", "The viking based bracelets, are they someting like this? \n\nhttps://museum-jewelry.com/shop/bracelets-107c1.html", "Got it. Cultural appropriation.  I just wasted time trying to discover a racist history behind bindis lol", "Only someone who has no idea about Hinduism (and honestly usually an American) would jump from seeing a white woman with a Bindi to \u201cmust be racist\u201d/\u201ccultural appropriation\u201d.\n\nWearing the bindi is in many Hindu families simply expected by married women - *all* married women; if that married woman happens to be white, she would just as much be expected to wear it as if she is Indian (sometimes ironically the expectation on a white woman to fulfill all of the cultural traditions is even stronger than on an Indian woman).\n\nSo seeing a random white woman on the street wearing a bindi and a mangala sutra and maybe even a kurta or a saree might have nothing to do with cultural appropriation at all (which in itself is a super American concept) - jumping to *that* as the first explanation without knowing anything about her makes no sense.", "Oh. Cultural appropriation, then.", "In many Indian families married women are supposed to wear the bindi; independent of if they are white or Hindu themselves. I never self identified as Hindu, and yet still out of respect to my in-laws and Indian family members followed whatever expectations I was supposed to, including wearing the bindi.\n\nCultural appropriation is a super weird American concept and has nothing to do with how people in the actual countries in question view the situation. If you travel/live as a white woman in India, you will receive 9 out of 10 times more respect if you show up somewhere in a salwar or a kurta or a saree, as if you show up in jeans and tank top. Nobody is going to see you in a salwar and think \u201cshe is appropriating my culture\u201d; they are going to look at you and think \u201cshe is respecting my culture and following the rules\u201d.", "Well if you wear a t-shirt with a swastika at a job interview good luck explaining that to HR\u2026", "Well i do wear a swastika ( i don't do because of religion but rather it's souvenir from someone) and it's different from the nazi symbol you're mistaking it for .", "Exactly, her being atheist adds a different layer and totally changes the tone of what the original post is. \n\nTbh I now think this whole thing is as fake as can be.", "I could definitely see how your brain did that. It definitely could have been worded differently. I think my brain just picked up on it because of the area I live in war bonnets are big discussions so my brain immediately went to \"ohh okay, I know what this person means.\"", "Valid point, but here we're talking about someone who does know her personally so I could see where that would be a line drawn by her partner. It was just an example provided by the original commentator of the difference between iconography and things that have depth and meaning.\n\nEdit; and the person asking was specifically asking about the bindi in reference to the original commentator. I was just providing context of what that commentator meant by using the bindi as an example and not what the following commentator thought of bindi's having racist history.", "Right, but in this example if she wore a bindi it wouldn't be because of knowledge of the culture or respect. There is a huge difference between cultural appropriation and cultural appreciation which I will admit gets lost on some people. But this particular woman is a white woman, I assume in America, who's not married, who doesn't know anything about the culture or religion, and that strays away from cultural appreciation into seeing someone's culture as only a fashion statement without understanding the importance of what they're wearing or it's weight in the culture they are refusing to learn about. That would be the issue in this particular circumstance. And how doing that is very different than wearing a cross necklace or a pentagram ring for example. \n\nThe idea of cultural appropriation in America is that it's steeped in ignorance and doesn't come from respect, understanding, or appreciation of the culture/religion but is used as a fashion statement and thus becomes a caricature.", "I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t use common sense, I\u2019m saying that people whose symbols have been misappropriated aren\u2019t wrong for wearing them, and that they are in fact neutral. \n\nNo, life doesn\u2019t happen in a vacuum, ergo, folks don\u2019t tend to wear swastikas to job interviews, at least in the west. They\u2019re all over the place in India. Things are  viewed differently in different places, we all know this. But instantly decrying a particular religious symbol as bad (like OP is saying about Nordic religious symbols) because they\u2019ve been misappropriated by shitty people whose views absolutely do not represent the religion as a whole, is reductive and harmful. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to point out.", "But the point is when you see a white woman with a Salwar and a bindi walk across the street in Manhattan, you have absolutely 0 idea about her involvement or lack of involvement in Indian culture. So what\u2019s the point in throwing out cultural appropriation accusations in situations like that, until it\u2019s something super clear like somebody dressing up as a certain ethnicity for Halloween?", "You talked about context, and I think that is the same think OP is talking about: in his country some symbols his gf wears are used by racist people and (maybe) they are also a cultural appropriation. She grew up in a crystal ball (glass ball?), now she lives outside of it but she finds difficult to connect how those symbols affect other people.", "But this is about her partner not some random person on the street . If she was doing this, her partner would know and this would be in the right to say something. This isn't about some random stranger saying something's appropriation. A random person wouldn't because they don't know, I agree with you. But her partner would know and then would be in the right to bring it up *if* she went that far. Which the original commentator is saying, it would be worth bringing up if it went that far but it hasn't, so he should chill.\n\nEdit; again the bindi was an example, not something she is currently doing."]}
