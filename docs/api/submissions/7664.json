So I\u2019ll give my overall thoughts:\n\nYou are obviously legally allowed to not make your twin a bridesmaid.  As far as whether or not it\u2019s asshole territory, I\u2019ve got mixed thoughts.  The reason errs on the petty side.  I understand it was seriously traumatic and left a more negative impact on you than your sister even sees, but people change after high school.  High schoolers in general can be really shitty to each other.  Holding the grudge against your sister at your wedding at 25 years old is harsh and shows no interest in improving the relationship with your twin sister.  But, you\u2019ve made it clear that she hasn\u2019t formally apologized for who she was in high school.  So I understand the grudge considerably more.\n\nSo I have to give a judgement, and I guess it\u2019s NTA.  It\u2019s your choice obviously, and I get where you\u2019re coming from.  \n\nBut more important than imposing judgement, **you guys need to sit down and hash this out, the sooner the better**.

You still sound like you\u2019re clinging to the anger and pain and that will only hurt you in the long run. \n\nPeople do stupid things when they\u2019re young and it sounds like she\u2019s reaching out and hoping to patch up the relationship even though you\u2019re acting like a child. You\u2019re getting married so grow up and have a discussion with your sister. Calmly share your feelings and past hurts.

We are VERY different people, and that's partly nature and partly nurture - our parents pushed us to have separate friends and separate interests, we were never in the same classes or activities ... so that definitely minimized the conflict.  But it also never let us develop the skills of adjusting to and accommodating each other, of working together even though it wasn't a perfect fit, of being on the same side once in a while instead of just this behavior that made it seem like being oppositional was just inherent and couldn't ever be avoided.  As adults (we're 42), we are learning those skills.  But man, it would've been way easier to already have some of that work done when my mom broke her hip and suddenly needed caretaking, or when my job was her reason for keeping me away from my nephews for years during the worst of the pandemic.  We are getting closer to a middle ground, but we didn't have to start so far apart - so I guess my best advice to a parent is to let your kids do some of that work while you can be present to guide them. I would have been a happier person and I would have been more fun for the whole family (incl me) if I'd had a better handle on these skills when I was younger.  \n\n\nEdit: NTA for OP.  Your wedding, your rules. My twin sister (I was the nerd, she was popular) chose two bridesmaids and refused to name one of us MOH.  I literally did all the work of an MOH and then some (we're a small family and not wealthy) and the day before the wedding, she admitted this and said she had been wrong not to give the title to me.  I found I didn't want the title.  The acknowledgment of the work I did for her and her admitting she hadn't performed perfectly was plenty for me.  After the wedding, maybe talk to your sister about how you feel and see if she'd like to work together to close a little of the gap between you or heal a little of your wounds.  What you suffered was a lot, but it's possible you might not need as much as you think to feel a whole lot better about it.", "100%", "It could be a point of healing, sure, but if sister hasn't expressed remorse I'm not sure she's entitled to decide when the healing begins and then demand a seat at the table she hasn't earned.

Just my two cents.", "Obviously, OP's sister is the golden child.", "Tbh it\u2019s not childish at all - her sister is a grown up now and could have apologized and talked this out like an adult.

That's why I said not to back down; the wedding itself is not where the healing needs to start (letting her in the party as an act of reconnection), I meant more that this event could be the rock bottom where they can work their way up from.

And I don't understand the comments here that say otherwise.", "I disagree, holding someome accountable for childish behaviour when they where a child years after isn't mature.\n\nOP hasn't described them continuing this behaviour as an adult, in fact the only bully like behaviour came from op, when placed in a social position of power used it to say something hurtful.\n\nAs I said, OPs trauma, no one can tell her how to feel about something but same is true for her sister. The example of her twins awfulness is her paying her 100 to pretend she was sick on her 16th, which she accepted informing us she had no friends and would most likely be bullied.

It sounds like OP is extremely hostile to her sister while her sister is trying to reconnect. \n\nOP might not be an asshole for not wishing to reconnect, that\u2019s completely her own choice, but how she chooses to express that can still be asshole-ish.

Teenagers should be held accountable for bad behavior, and adults should have the present sense to look back at their childhood and acknowledge their wrongs and ask forgiveness. \n\nOPs sister was so hurt by her statement because it reminds her of the past she is trying to pretend never happened, it\u2019s forcing her to be held accountable for her own cruelty. To say that makes OP a bully is frankly gross.

Instead, they are pushing for it to cover and forgive their guilt quickly, and excuse their own sense of guilt over it. This is pretty compounding, and I'm sorry they reacted this way. They should be mature enough to recognize you are an adult, and have more than enough of a right to include whomever you want.\n\nAs for your twin sister, she is probably shocked because she has had this attitude enabled throughout her life and she can't fathom why you can't just care about her feelings without her ever considering your feelings.

Your standing up to her is a shocker, and will send her world tumbling down, and she'll be forced to face the fact she's treated you horribly. \n\nNow this is not to say it can't be reconciled. It can, but only if she comes to the realization of how wrong she has been. Looks like this might be the catalyst for your whole family.

You will know it's sincere when they not only actually show remorse, but they tell you they know they do not deserve to even attend, and are grateful for the invitation, which is exceedingly gracious of you and shows how forgiving and caring you are. The fact that they don't recognize this means they are not grown up enough to be invited or included in your life now. They are panicking because they are losing you. Trust that if you include her, she will try to make it about her, and your parents will allow it. Don't do that to yourself.
