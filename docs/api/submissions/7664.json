So I\u2019ll give my overall thoughts:\n\nYou are obviously legally allowed to not make your twin a bridesmaid.  As far as whether or not it\u2019s asshole territory, I\u2019ve got mixed thoughts.  The reason errs on the petty side.  I understand it was seriously traumatic and left a more negative impact on you than your sister even sees, but people change after high school.  High schoolers in general can be really shitty to each other.  Holding the grudge against your sister at your wedding at 25 years old is harsh and shows no interest in improving the relationship with your twin sister.  But, you\u2019ve made it clear that she hasn\u2019t formally apologized for who she was in high school.  So I understand the grudge considerably more.\n\nSo I have to give a judgement, and I guess it\u2019s NTA.  It\u2019s your choice obviously, and I get where you\u2019re coming from.  \n\nBut more important than imposing judgement, **you guys need to sit down and hash this out, the sooner the better**.

You still sound like you\u2019re clinging to the anger and pain and that will only hurt you in the long run. \n\nPeople do stupid things when they\u2019re young and it sounds like she\u2019s reaching out and hoping to patch up the relationship even though you\u2019re acting like a child. You\u2019re getting married so grow up and have a discussion with your sister. Calmly share your feelings and past hurts.

We are VERY different people, and that's partly nature and partly nurture - our parents pushed us to have separate friends and separate interests, we were never in the same classes or activities ... so that definitely minimized the conflict.  But it also never let us develop the skills of adjusting to and accommodating each other, of working together even though it wasn't a perfect fit, of being on the same side once in a while instead of just this behavior that made it seem like being oppositional was just inherent and couldn't ever be avoided.  As adults (we're 42), we are learning those skills.  But man, it would've been way easier to already have some of that work done when my mom broke her hip and suddenly needed caretaking, or when my job was her reason for keeping me away from my nephews for years during the worst of the pandemic.  We are getting closer to a middle ground, but we didn't have to start so far apart - so I guess my best advice to a parent is to let your kids do some of that work while you can be present to guide them. I would have been a happier person and I would have been more fun for the whole family (incl me) if I'd had a better handle on these skills when I was younger.  \n\n\nEdit: NTA for OP.  Your wedding, your rules. My twin sister (I was the nerd, she was popular) chose two bridesmaids and refused to name one of us MOH.  I literally did all the work of an MOH and then some (we're a small family and not wealthy) and the day before the wedding, she admitted this and said she had been wrong not to give the title to me.  I found I didn't want the title.  The acknowledgment of the work I did for her and her admitting she hadn't performed perfectly was plenty for me.  After the wedding, maybe talk to your sister about how you feel and see if she'd like to work together to close a little of the gap between you or heal a little of your wounds.  What you suffered was a lot, but it's possible you might not need as much as you think to feel a whole lot better about it.", "100%", "It could be a point of healing, sure, but if sister hasn't expressed remorse I'm not sure she's entitled to decide when the healing begins and then demand a seat at the table she hasn't earned.

Just my two cents.", "Obviously, OP's sister is the golden child.", "Tbh it\u2019s not childish at all - her sister is a grown up now and could have apologized and talked this out like an adult.

That's why I said not to back down; the wedding itself is not where the healing needs to start (letting her in the party as an act of reconnection), I meant more that this event could be the rock bottom where they can work their way up from.

And I don't understand the comments here that say otherwise.", "I disagree, holding someome accountable for childish behaviour when they where a child years after isn't mature.\n\nOP hasn't described them continuing this behaviour as an adult, in fact the only bully like behaviour came from op, when placed in a social position of power used it to say something hurtful.\n\nAs I said, OPs trauma, no one can tell her how to feel about something but same is true for her sister. The example of her twins awfulness is her paying her 100 to pretend she was sick on her 16th, which she accepted informing us she had no friends and would most likely be bullied.

It sounds like OP is extremely hostile to her sister while her sister is trying to reconnect. \n\nOP might not be an asshole for not wishing to reconnect, that\u2019s completely her own choice, but how she chooses to express that can still be asshole-ish.

To say that makes OP a bully is frankly gross.

I actually didn't have a bridal party at my wedding, just a MOH and Best Man, largely so that I wouldn't feel pressure to have my sisters in the wedding party as opposed to my friends (there isn't even drama their really, we just had different experiences growing up and I don't feel as close to them).  It's your wedding, and you do what you want.  \n\nI find that parents often try to force a reconciliation between their children, but that just doesn't work.  If you parents are helping pay for the wedding, I get how that might add some extra pressure, but just stand firm and mature in saying that your sister is invited to the wedding, but it's important to you that your bridal party is made up of your sorority sisters.  Hilarious as it is to joke about paying your sister $100 bucks to be sick, just be way more classy and adult than the rest of your family.  Hopefully one day your sister will be able to apologize to you.", "NTA. Like at all. Her crocodile tears mean nothing if she hasn\u2019t owned up and given a heartfelt apologies either. She just feels entitled to move passed it bc it didn\u2019t happen to her", "Not going to vote on this as only you know your personal trauma and what it entails.

Absolutely NTA.", "Definitely nta", "NTA. It is your wedding, your choice of BMs. I do think you are being a little harsh, but I didn't live through what you lived through.", "I do have an INFO question: You mention that since she was so outgoing, she ditched you for the popular kids. Did she just ditch you, or an entire friend group? Because making more friends is normal. The part where those friends of hers bullied you isn't.\n\nAnother question: Beyond not being friends with them (which she shouldn't have been after they started bullying you) was there anything else you would've wanted her to do? Those are the questions.\n\nBecause  your sister can't actually control whether or not you were bullied. She didn't want to be bullied either, and she manage to avoid it in ways that weren't fair to you\u2014but asking her to be bullied alongside you isn't fair to her. That's kinda why the bullies are to blame more than anyone else here\u2014it's them that put everyone in unavoidable unfair situations.\n\nUsually I wouldn't paint your sisters actions in that light, but you mention how she pretended everything was fine at home . . . and so did you? She may have thought things were fine at home, which drastically changes how insightful she'd be about the impact the bullying was having on you. Again, since it seemed you were still getting along. Esp. since when, *first* chance she got to interact with you without being bullied herself, she did and that was when she found out things were wrong.\n\nYou guys can't read each-others minds, it sounds like communication was needed here and didn't happen, not that anything malicious happened. That you'd mourn a relationship so much when someone is actively trying to have one with you, though, is concerning to me. Your sister was immature. Not malicious. And it doesn't sound like she thought she was better than you\u2014keeping her head down sounds like she thinks she was luckier.\n\nAnd the money thing: It def. hurts, and is fair to be hurt by that. If she wasn't placing it in the same bullying context as you, but rather in the context of \"my sister that I always get along with at home who I don't want to see being bullied at a party I know she'll be bullied at, and I can pay her money while having her not be bullied?\" . . . well, she could have genuinely thought she was helping, not hurting, you. Again, the ideal outcome would've been her not being friends with these people\u2014that was a mistake on her part, and not a minor one in the least. I can understand entirely why a teen would make that mistake, though, if they thought things were fine. They'd be entirely too relived to be smarter.\n\nNow, take from this what you feel applies to you. It's very much a 'best light' reading of the situation, and you'd know what better than me what actually fits from it. Also, maybe recognize that \"I didn't mean to hurt you, I was immature\" is an apology, in this case\u2014because it's a bridge to those different understandings that you guys never communicated. She can't apologize for deliberately hurting you, not if it wasn't her experience at the time that things were fine. Usually, people like to *understand* and communicate the whys behind actions, rather than say \"my, you're right, I was unfair to you.\" This is because the latter ignores the bit where it would've been unfair for her to get bullied, too, and that part is particularly hard to explain\u2014everybody, and I mean everybody, needs to be fair to themselves in relationships, not just some abstract ideal of fairness. Not doing so is how we get relationships where people dismiss their own abuse because of a partners mental health, when yeah, we'd want everyone to be supported ideally\u2014but also we want no-one to be hurt, and it's never fair to ask another person to hurt themselves for you.\n\nNone of this means you need to have a relationship with her.
