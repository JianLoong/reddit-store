His family? Not so much. I have a really strained relationship with his brother who has been really disrespectful to both me and my husband in the past (despite that fact that we paid his entire college tuition, boarding, meals, etc.) We\u2019ve been trying to work on mending our familial relationships in couple\u2019s counselling and have agreed to be clear about our feelings and respect each other\u2019s boundaries. \n\nA few days ago my husband told me he was going to call to check in on his brother who was tripping at the time. I was curious how he got any LSD since it\u2019s difficult to find here. He told me he had given him one of my plugs (who has never had LSD before mind you). I figure since I haven\u2019t bought in a while, it might be true and moved on. \n\nYesterday, I do not know what possessed me but I decided to look through his phone (I have literally never done this before). To my surprise, I saw that he had went through my stash and met his brother nearby and given him LSD. Now, I\u2019m not mad about what he did. I wouldn\u2019t even be that mad if he has hid what he did. But I am furious that he intentionally lied to me. And as I said before my husband is a literal angel, I honestly didn\u2019t even believe he would be capable of lying so easily. When I confront him he doesn\u2019t see any issue with what he did, he claims I would be upset if he had asked me permission. I asked if he thought lying to me wouldn\u2019t make me upset, and he just began giving me the silent treatment. \n\nAt this point I got so pissed that I went to my stash and flushed everything. I know this was probably stupid but I was just so angry and honestly I procured and purchased these items so it doesn\u2019t really matter what I choose to do with them. But I do acknowledge that this was dramatic and am not proud of my reaction.   \n\nIt\u2019s been two days since he\u2019s spoken to me and we aren\u2019t seeing our counsellor for another few days. I know my reaction was unnecessary but I don\u2019t feel I deserve to be the asshole for catching him in a lie. So reddit, AITA?\n\nTLDR: My husband lied to me about stealing drugs and giving them to his brother. I found out while going through his phone and out of spite disposed of all my drugs. He is now not speaking to me.\n\nUpdate: My husband has now removed my face ID from his phone and changed his password to prevent me from looking at anything else he has.

I definitely think that was an overreaction, but it felt justified given that I was hurt by the fact that my husband had intentionally lied to me about something seemingly trivial. There is also the violation of a boundary we had discussed earlier, which was that we would not be meeting his brother for the next few weeks (or until he apologises) since he had been really disrespectful to me and his mom (who lives with us) the last time we saw him.

Your further comments about your arranged marriage five years ago, your husband's use of your income and labor to support himself and his family even when they have inheritance and his brothers are making way more money than you? I am so horrified by your actual situation--you have never lived alone, your own family was abusive to you, your marriage was without consent--that I cannot even understand how you will survive.\n\nYet, clearly, you have a good education that you earned; you have a job outside the home; you now know that your husband shares his family's attitude toward you. You have choices. You need professional help perhaps to get out of this toxic situation. \n\nThat's not what you asked. You asked about your rage-based flushing of drugs. Lord, child, no one in your family needs to be taking drugs right now. It's okay. You acted on impulse, but you probably did the right thing. Now look at yourself, get yourself into private counseling, and find your steps out of this horrible marriage and family.", "If he is that smooth at lying, this is probably just the first time he got caught.\n\nI don't do drugs anymore, but I'd be pissed if someone took anything of mine without permission.

If he was the 'saint' you are claiming he is, the right thing to do would be to tell you the truth at the start and actually give you the opportunity to dislike the idea or not, that's treating you with respect.

Where\u2019s the good in this guy? He lies and steals and tolerates his family actively hating OP. He has somehow convinced her to support these same bags of garbage financially. He\u2019s a coward and he doesn\u2019t respect OP at all. Is his company really better than being alone?", "We\u2019re in counselling since my husband and I both have different forms of communicating and can really never resolve any conflict since I am\nvery confrontational and he is avoidant (as this situation illustrates lol). \n\nI truly don\u2019t know what possessed me to go through it, his brother had sent him a text while I was scrolling through tiktok (my phone was dead) and I went back up the convo to just see what the text was about. I went a little farther back than necessary and found this nugget of information. \n\nHis brother is very Jordan Peterson and believes all women are evil and prey on men. He\u2019s made many comments in the past that insinuate that I am using his brother when in fact I\u2019ve never taken a dollar from him and have actually used whatever I\u2019ve earned to support him and his family. When his brother lived with us during college breaks he would order me to constantly cook and clean after him, purposely leaving the toilet seat up or leaving pubes or beard hair all over my shower/sink and never taking accountability since it is my responsibility as a woman to serve him as a guest in my house. He also never allowed me to speak and would ridicule me if I ever did try to or even stand up for myself. My husband being avoidant never tried to address this with him even if he was being rude in front of him. \n\nHis familial relationships are strained since his dad passed and he is now responsible for taking on the patriarchal role. That comes with a whole mess of everyone fighting over inheritance and just misdirecting a lot of anger as a response to grief. I grew up in a very abusive household so I no longer speak to my family, which is why it hurts that I am not accepted by his either. But at this point I am happy enough to just have him, which is why it hurts to have the one person close to me be dishonest.", "Bring all of his lies to light at your next counseling session say something like \"I would like it if you stopped acting like I'm stupid about the lying\" and bring these up", "So he just casually took what 'we' had, when it was not collectively yours (plural), but belonged strictly to you (singular)? And didn't tell you because you would say no and he didn't want to hear no?", "[deleted]", "He is an extremely loving and supportive husband. This behaviour is so out of character which is why I am so angry and hurt. His family does hate me and while he doesn\u2019t really protect me he did allow me to remove myself from the situation. However, recently he has told me that if I leave the house when his brothers visit that he will divorce me and that I should tolerate their disrespect if I love him. I\u2019m torn because this is not the same person I have been with the last 5 years. I married him when I was 18 (we were arranged but he has always been loving) and have never spent a day of my life alone. I could never imagine leaving someone who has been a constant in my formative years of life.", "Correct", "Wait\u2026 so how is he loving & supportive to YOU?? Sounds like you work to support both of you now, worked to support his brother and family before - whereas he takes advantage of you, steals from your savings and lies to you. \n\nYou were very young when you married. I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019re seeing the marriage and your respective roles clearly. \n\nNTA. But your husband sounds selfish, manipulative and dismissive of your needs, your wants and you as a person who can set boundaries.", "Okay, yeah, you have every right to be mightily upset about that!! When somebody says \"I didn't ask because you'd have said no,\" what they are telling you is that, at least in that instance, your consent is unimportant to them. It's no more than a minor nuisance to work around. \n\nSince you tell us that this is decidedly not the way he usually treats you -- I'm assuming that his normal sainthood includes respect for your decisions and a healthy understanding that no means no and must be accepted with good grace, right? -- I think you will need to drill down into why exactly he felt that your consent didn't matter *this* time.", "I\u2019m venting a lot about family and finances but outside of that he really does take care of me. He helps out with cooking and cleaning, takes me out of bed/to appointments whenever I\u2019m depressed, always gives me ample love and reassurance. He is the kind of person who will always let you put on the show/movie you wanna watch or play the music you wanna listen to. He has also been really supportive of my career, giving me a lot of advice and helping me apply and do interviews etc. I haven\u2019t always been the best to him, obviously coming from an abusive household I mimicked a lot of those behaviours myself. He\u2019s never yelled at me or laid a hand on me. He\u2019s been patient as I work through my trauma in therapy but when it comes to his family he is no longer a loving and agreeable person. I think you\u2019re right, it\u2019s been 5 years and our roles are changing. I used to be someone who gave their everything (emotionally, financially, mentally) but now I just don\u2019t have the capacity to do that for him. I think this transition has been difficult, and we should have a conversation about how much the each of us can carry/tolerate.", "I don\u2019t know how you did it but you put exactly how I feel into words. I want to ask but am afraid to hear that my consent doesn\u2019t matter because his brother\u2019s needs are more important. While it may seem narcissistic, I do want to be the most important thing to him and it would really hurt to hear that he values someone who has mistreated me more. I understand they have spent their whole life together but I can\u2019t see things from his perspective because I\u2019m not him. Therefore, what may be a logical truth to him is just a painful stab to me.", "I think you\u2019re trying to address the issues, so I don\u2019t want to go on about it but ignoring you in response to a disagreement (when he lied and stole) and ultimatums for you to take his family\u2019s abuse is NOT taking care of you/ showing ample love or reassurance. He has his own abusive behaviours - they\u2019re just quieter and more manipulative than yours.\n\nI think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re looking at your relationship  again because it needs to be a more balanced situation that truly supports you (including finances). Don\u2019t be afraid to step away if it\u2019s not right - as you know working through learned behaviour and trauma is a long road, you both need to be on it together.", "Um. I have to take issue with the term \"brother's needs\" in regard to LSD. Brother's wants? sure. Brother's whim? absolutely. But not a \"need.\" LSD is fun, it's not a necessity. Your husband betrayed you over a whimsical impulse his brother had. \n\nYour behavior, making a decision and taking action in a fit of rage is a problem for you to solve. \n\nSnooping on hubby's phone, being a one-time event and intuitive, seems okay since you needed the information you got from his phone. \n\nClearly your next counseling session should have a lot of drama and you should try to learn how your husband really thinks and feels about his marriage to you. Taking your drugs is completely out of line, especially since he believed you would object. That's low. Lying to you about it is also very lowdown bad. Don't know how long you have been married, but you may be seeing the real person now, not on best behavior.", "You have every right to expect to be the most important thing to your partner. If you aren\u2019t, then that\u2019s something to discuss - and something to consider whether you continue. I\u2019d recommend counsel of u/harmlessoldlady and u/voyagerVII here as they are doling out solid guidance.", "Tell him that. All of it, in so many words."]}
