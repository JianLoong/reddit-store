I have talked to my fiance about it, but he just blows me off, saying it's not important. He says they probably just feel like my son doesn't  have to clean, so they don't feel like they should. But my son does clean. I try to be patient with the girls since they lost their mother, but my fiance doesn't make them do anything. The 6yo has told her dad I treat her like Cinderella. The playroom is the only thing I ask them to clean because I can't get to the laundry room when their toys are everywhere.\n\nMy fiance and I got into a huge fight over the playroom and I said I felt like asking the girls to help clean the playroom is a daily occurrence and I just feel frustrated and overwhelmed after cleaning up the playroom every night. I asked him for help in the situation and asked him to speak to his children about cleaning up the playroom. He flipped out on me and told me I treat his children like slaves and my son gets away with everything, and I should worry about disciplining my son. Am I the asshole?

Look, I experienced similar when I had a boyfriend. I homeschooled my, at the time, 4 year old because he has a learning disability.

And I was just a girlfriend at the time, nowhere near a fianc\u00e9. This guy turned out to be an abusive man and I was just getting a early taste with that. His disdain for my little toddler grew and your experiencing that now with your guy. It won\u2019t get better. It only gets worse. And his attitude about your baby will get worse. Him babying his kids will get worse. Their behavior will get worse. He will never allow you to effectively parent his kids. His kids will always do no wrong. He will always find a way to blame you for singling out his kids and use it to single out yours instead, like he JUST did. Your kid, even though he is just a baby now, will always be a problem. This guy is literally LOOKING for you to be the evil step mom and if his girls say you are, he believes them\u2026like he JUST did. And he will attack your child, like he JUST did.  He won\u2019t always attack him like that to you. One day he will do it directly to your child. Don\u2019t subject your baby to a man like that. Even if he doesn\u2019t understand and won\u2019t remember it now, he will one day. Be the mom who is picky about the kind of person they allow around their baby.

There are different expectations of 6-7 year olds and 3 year olds.  This is not about favouring your 3 year old.  Your fiance is setting a poor model for his kids.

A few weeks of that and he may change his thinking.\n\nAlso, he has put you in a position where you are homeschooling the children and having to act as the disciplinarian.
