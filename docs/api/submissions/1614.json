Isn\u2019t part of recovery making amends to the people you have wronged? She isn\u2019t doing that with a small apology to you. You can choose not to have a relationship with her or anyone else.

It\u2019s easier for the family if you don\u2019t make them confront uncomfortable truths, but if it\u2019s bothering you that much you should not be expected to \u201clet it go\u201d just so they feel comfortable.
