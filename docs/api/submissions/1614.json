At all.", "There is no indication anywhere in the post that the cousin is part of any recovery process", "NTA", "NTA.  Forgiveness is earned. That starts with acknowledging what you did wrong and making reparations. You were nice to give your cousin a desktop after the theft.", "I get cold. Learned it from an ex girlfriend. I still liked her but she stopped liking me. Didn't take me long to learn that relationship is dead. I would just not care if that person was there or not. I would not hide my feelings. Like when they come to my world, I automatically secure my belongings. They talk to me and I am unresponsive. They do things for me and I am unappreciative.", "You can pick your nose but you can't pick your family. I would be polite to keep the peace within your family for Christmas. **TW talk about drug abuse I**>! feel bad for your cousin who has probably spent his formative years lying about his junkie Mom who sells anything and everything that isn't nailed down to smoke or shoot up with.!<\n\nYou are NTA - I would however give your cousin cash or physical presents. Instead plan a day out somewhere.", "NTA.  She can ask for forgiveness **after** she has replaced what she stole.", "NTA - the family should be helping the cousin's son get put of the abusive home. They hurt him by pretending normal.", "NTA a junkie stole her kids laptop and they want you to make peace? Hell no. I\u2019d call her out on it and explain to all your well-meaning relatives that they can pay you for the stolen laptop or she can have charges pressed", "NTA- but me being the petty one I am, I\u2019d get them ALLLLL together. Bring her up, and say \u201cso did you get a good score with the laptop you stole from your son?\u201d In front of them all. That would be the apology I\u2019d want.", "And an amend in this case would be to replace the actual gaming laptop", "NTA\n\nand don't forget that she may pretend to not be an addict and a thief but she always will be.", "NTA\n\nI say this as a recovered drug addict of 16 years. The rest of your family are the AH and are not helping in her recovery if they just want to swept this under the rug. Part of recovery is making amends. But you have to actually mean them. I did some messed up shit when I was an addict. I went to the people I wronged and apologized. I took the consequences that came with the messed up shit I did. Lost a few people I loved along the way. But I never blamed those people because it was my actions that caused the end of the relationships. \n\nI really feel for you nephew. I wish there was some way to get home out of the abuse he is suffering.", "Fuck her.   I grew up in a family like this where no matter how shit my brother was I was expected to accept his apology.   It's cancerous to your mental health.", "NTA\n\nBut why is everyone in the family overlooking that this woman stole her child\u2019s things for DRUGS???\n\nLike, thieving is a symptom of a much bigger problem, and one that threatens the safety of your young cousin. (Who is possibly a minor.)", "NTA. The onus of reconciliation is not on you. It's on your cousin.", "NTA.  Sounds like your family is just enabling her.  It's totally your call if you want to forgive her or if you even want to be in the same room as her.\n\nThis would be your decision but if she's stealing his property to purchase drugs, I can't imagine what else she's doing to her son.  You might consider dropping a dime with child protective services.", "Agreed. \"Forgiveness is divine\" and such. Family is more important than stuff, yes, but she could at least admit her fault. I feel like just pretending it's gone just leaves her open to doing stuff again.", "Dotto.\n\nI said I'd pay for his plane tickets to any realtives/friends if he ever felt like getting away for a while. And his mom, like a five year old, \"has to come along\" to make sure he's okay, thus voiding the entire point.\n\nI'd even fly down to pick him up if it wasn't for her definitely insisting on coming along. She's like a child, and the family is so scared of making her cry or tempting her suicide issues... without worrying about her poor son trapped in this crap.", "Good point. She's still playing the victim card from what I hear too. I'd be happy with just an apology, but it's looking like that's not happening. I hope she at least apologized to her son.", "Couldn't agree more.", "Tempting, admittedly. She's by no means wealthy, so I'd just be happy with an apology and be done with it. But... you might be onto something, maybe give the ultimatum of 2k or a real \"I'm sorry\" and an admission that she's a thief.", "Hey, that's what I call my neighbors! It is fairly effective too.", "Never. Not even hinted at it. It's like she doesn't even consider herself wrong, as if the addiction was the only thing at fault.", "Agreed", "In this case, absolutely agreed. If she wants us to be chummy family again, she should at least treat family like family and apologize. \n\nI wish I could do more for him. His immediate family is pretty awful, one aunt practically held him hostage for like a month after he visited her, she refused to take him to the airport till her tiff with his mom was resolved. During the school year, mind. And his stupid mother and others refused to call the police. I threatened to, but got so much pushback I just did what I could to pressure parties to get them to make up.\n\nLooking back on it, I should have just called the police... that 'aunt' also 'took back' the puppy she'd given to him months later, breaking his heart, and is now trying to leverage the dog against his mother.\n\nPhew... didn't mean to vent. It's just so effed up for the poor kid.", "Tempting. But it's less about the money, though daaaang it hurts, and more about her just being a decent person and apologizing. But for some reason my family keeps taking her side and acts like I'm being the jerk. It's weird.\n\nAlso, pressing charges... it'd just ruin her son's life even more. His mother's an idiot, but she at least tries to love him now, from what I've heard.", "My sadistic gremlin side completely agrees with you. And if she doesn't fess up soon, maybe it's what I'll do. Of course, without her son present.", "I think she'd sooner OD than give 2k away, since that's a lot, a lotta lot of money for her. I don't plan on trying to get it back. I do 100% want an admission of what she did and an apology though. A 2k worth apology.", "Yeah, by leaving him there it's cruel. Unfortunately, his immediate family isn't good at all. And the kid is loyal to his mother; he's a good kid, being loyal and forgiving his mother despite all her crap. He's got a big heart. Arguably too big.", "Yeah I feel bad for him too. Gonna be sending him some extra gifts this year. Unfortunately he's half way across the country, so I'm a bit limited in what I can do right now. I wanted to save up and nab him a ps5, but those are about as rare as gold atm....", "I hear you, but if I get cold, that doesn't make me happier. I don't want to limit my happiness and myself because I want someone to apologize. Basically, if someone wrongs you, I don't believe they should have any power over you, at all.\n\nSucks about your girlfriend. Hope you find someone new. As far as relationships go, try actually being just you and finding happiness. The biggest \"FU\" for that kind of relationship is you moving on and showing them what they missed out on. Then whenever they talk to you or see you, they feel that burn, but by then you don't need to care, since you've left them in the rear view mirror.", "Forgiveness can only be given once repentance occurs. It can be available on condition if repentance but the transfer won\u2019t happen until the conditions are met.", "> She's still playing the victim card from what I hear too\n\nIf I were you, I would embarrass your cousin with sarcastic comments whenever you meet. Make sure to ask the questions loudly enough for everyone to hear:\n\n* It must be exhausting thinking of new schemes to steal from your son, so how do you stay refreshed?\n\n* My friend is thinking about stealing from his children, so can he contact you for advice?\n\n* Do you steal your son\u2019s valuables all at once (like harvesting strawberries) or in cycles (like harvesting wheat)?\n\n* Is stealing from your child a union job or do you freelance?", "It's concerning that your family is backing her. Have they made sure your cousin is being parented? Is he safe? Is he fed? Is their heat? Does he see a doctor when needed?  It seems if she is stealing from him for her drug habit, your cousin may not be safe nor taken care of.", "Then you are under zero obligation to her for any damn thing.", "I grew up in a family like this, all the birthday and Christmas money my mom took / stole from me and used for her cigarettes/drinks. The only way I got her to stop- was to ask her where the money went in front of everyone/the person who gave it to me. She even took $3k from my bank when she kicked me out- they\u2019ll keep doing it, it\u2019s a sickness!", "Thanks. This happened 30 years ago. She left me in her head. I could tell she didn't care. We broke up and I did that thing where I call and call one night not saying anything but trying to get her back. She had feelings for me before. After, she couldn't care. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stopped contacting her for a couple years. Then we tried hanging out in a friend group. She had a boyfriend. I still had nobody and secretly hung on. Pathetic. After a while, I got sick of heartbreak and moved on. Forgot about her. After a decade she wandered back in my life, just as I met my wife. I almost went back. Best decision of my life. Now when I see that girl, I hope she is happy and healthy. I learned to be careful, don't take for granted. What me and the wife share is special, until it ain't and you can't glue that glass back together\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen I am cold, it is more the absence of warmth. I agree. Hate controls you.", "Ouch. BRUTAL. That'd be a pretty hard KO. I'll have to consider it... btw, have you ever considered a career in verbal assassination? You'd do well there.", "When she was stuck on drugs, his grandpa made sure he was taken care of. Now she's trying to assume the role of caretaker, to what effect, I'm not totally sure. So he's got basic necessities down. I've been sending money when I can to help and confirm with his grandpa it's being used properly. So for that at least he's okay.", "Dang, sorry. That's a rough start in life. It is a sickness that destroys everyone around, not just one. Congrats on escaping all that crap as best you could. \n\nThis isn't 3k, but have a gold as a vote of respect. I hope you've found a far happier life now.", "Glad you found your happiness! And you're 100% correct. Hate controls you if you aren't careful. It too is an addiction is a sense. \n\nI don't hate my cousin, but I'm just not interested in \"playing\" family with her anymore. If someone doesn't want to respect you enough to say \"I'm sorry\", then you don't need to respect them.", "I wouldn't send money. Instead offer to go with and buy their groceries, or pay a bill directly. Less temptation and you know she isn't overstating costs and taking a little off the top.", "You as well! Thank you!", "NTA. You should not have to play peace keeper with a thief.", "NTA.  Addiction is a disease requiring real help, support, and forgiveness.  However personal responsibility is a big part of that process", "If you give the laptop to the kid get it in writing its a loaned item. If she steals it again tell her you will be calling the police and having her charged. NTA.\n\nAlso if this is a big issue and she starts back doing stuff like this you need to call CPS. This isnt ok. This isnt safe or healthy and he shouldn't be around that environment where nothing of his is safe and his mom is tweeking out with him a room away. \n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA, and if she really wants to make amends, then she can bloody well replace the gaming laptop; otherwise, it sounds like she\u2019s full of it.", "Are you willing and able to raise him?  If so, are you willing to go scorched earth to do that?", "You need to be careful with anything you do for him because he already tried to cover for his mom ones. Don\u2019t send him any expensive gifts or even money. He enables his mothers behavior because it\u2019s the way he grew up. Hopefully he gets to a point where he can stand on his own but right now you can\u2019t even trust him.", "op said that she is now supposedly off drugs, which would be considered being in recovery.", "While this would be absolutely HILARIOUS, if you do it please make sure you talk to the son first. If he's protecting her still it might backfire on your relationship with him worse.", "Don\u2019t do it.  Absolutely no point."]}
