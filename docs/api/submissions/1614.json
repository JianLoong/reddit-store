Basically, if someone wrongs you, I don't believe they should have any power over you, at all.\n\nSucks about your girlfriend. Hope you find someone new. As far as relationships go, try actually being just you and finding happiness. The biggest \"FU\" for that kind of relationship is you moving on and showing them what they missed out on.

The only way I got her to stop- was to ask her where the money went in front of everyone/the person who gave it to me. She even took $3k from my bank when she kicked me out- they\u2019ll keep doing it, it\u2019s a sickness!", "Thanks. This happened 30 years ago. She left me in her head. I could tell she didn't care.

That's a rough start in life. It is a sickness that destroys everyone around, not just one.

And you're 100% correct. Hate controls you if you aren't careful. It too is an addiction is a sense. \n\nI don't hate my cousin, but I'm just not interested in \"playing\" family with her anymore.

She\u2019s a thief, an abusive mother, and a toxic human being. Addicts destroy everything around them (experience here) and they too often con those around them. \n\nYou owe her nothing!  But your support of her child is commendable and I\u2019m sure it means the world to him. \n\nStay firm, she has earned nothing but contempt. Too often empathy and compassion turns out to be enabling. They know that and use it to their advantage.

That's up to you.  If she's not even sorry about it you most definitely don't have to let it go.  She's still in the disease most likely so all bets are off.  Not only should you not forget you should possibly distance yourself from her as well.\n\nTo be perfectly blunt, your family is enabling her and quite literally helping her disease.  If you wanted to distance yourself from more of them because you wanted no part of that you would be entirely justified and IMO right for doing so.  Obviously though, you do what you feel is right.  I am not trying to tell you what to do.\n\nAdditionally I would doubt she apologized to her son.  What the disease would make her conclude would probably be: \"It's not my fault things happen to me and I needed to use.  I did what I had to do.  He didn't need the laptop anyway.\".", "OP, every time a family member supports her by saying she's off drugs now, you should correct them by saying \"*Supposedly* off drugs\" (adding air quotes would be a bonus). That should piss her off and if you keep doing it, will plant doubt in the family's minds and make them keep a closer eye on her. Might also keep them from bringing up that sort of bs. Until she's actually involved in some sort of recovery program, she is essentially still using -- just maybe taking a break for a while.", "Well, that's not true - you can forgive someone even if they don't repent or even apologize. Forgiveness is about the feelings and attitudes of the wronged party, regardless of what the offender does.\n\nThat said, this person is not owed forgiveness in any case.", "I could understand why you might think this way, but it's kind of a terrible way to think.\n\nHe's not enabling his mom's behavior. He's a *teenager* \\- a literal child. He may have felt guilty that he \"let\" his mom steal the laptop, or simply ashamed and thus reticent to talk about it. People are making the *assumption* that he's trying to cover for his mom when that might not actually be the case. He didn't do anything untrustworthy here.\n\nBut even if he did...he's a kid! This kind of attitude will prevent children of substance abusers from getting help and keep them living in neglect without basic necessities. It's good to be careful with how money and expensive gifts are given, but cutting him off completely is going to not only deny him things he needs but also make him believe that he deserves to be punished because his mom is an addict.", "...I know it seems like it would work that way, but it doesn't necessarily.

You should be able to confront her and ask for an apology, if she denies it, makes excuses or says it wasn't her fault then you can declare to everyone that she hasn't changed and is more concerned with unearned family peace.

You should hold a grudge that your whole family is telling you, someone who was wrong, that you should just eat that and allow yourself to be mistreated by this person again.\n\nHonestly I think you should make a real blow up about this. She shouldn't be at the family Christmas because she's not active like family. She stole from her freaking kid, unless she's going to make things right, she shouldn't be at a family event.", "Good for her(being off drugs), but if she is, then she should be paying you back for what she stole.\n\nOP=NTA, She's lucky that you didn't file police report.", "The boy is family, why are they so keen on moving on in a way that is to his detriment and still puts him in a position of being victimized? If family is so important, why are they not moving to protect a vulnerable member of the family", "Right but where things like the 12-step program got the idea of amends from was looking at how people make right the wrongs they do. Even if she's not in a program, if she's a family member who actually wants to repair her relationships with family members that she has wronged, she would be making amends to the Sun and apologizing and making things right with other people she has injured.", "If she still presenting herself as a victim, she more than likely hasn't. He shouldn't have to take that, but you absolutely don't", "Indeed, like are you willing to really step in to help this kid? Cuz it doesn't sound like you can have peace with your family when they are prioritizing her wants over the safety of this kid. There is no peace when you let an aggressor into the space and let them do whatever they want", "Exactly, she needs to apologize, and give a replacement for what she stole", "Most 12-step programs preach abstinence (although it's not inherent). But, at least for ophiods  (I have no idea what his cousin is using), non-medicated treatment has a <5% success rate  (of still being clean) after 2 years. Whereas if you use stuff like buprenorphine or methadone it's around 85%.\n\nBut if you are using those, then most NA programs will treat you as if you are still at step 1 and will encourage you to stop taking the drugs that are largely preventing you from relapsing.\n\nThis is a very good article on this: https://projects.huffingtonpost.com/dying-to-be-free-heroin-treatment", "This exactly, like this feels like a point where you should be getting your family members involved and talking about how wrong it is that after abandoning her kid for others to take care of, she's trying to take back the rule of caretaker, and does that benefit the kid? No of course it doesn't, she's still not even stable, she's not even admitting that she did anything wrong.\n\nIt really sounds like you need to actually have a larger rowe with the rest of your family, cuz they're all just trying to bury this issue and move on, which is to the detriment of the young individual she has directly victimized with all of her actions. He needs to be protected cuz he's family and he's vulnerable! How are they okay with this and not pushing back that the kid deserves a stable environment?", "Oh lovely....I hope that aspect isn't present in Europe's AA. While thankfully I've no experience with the AA here I haven't heard such stories here.", "Thanks for the information,  always nice to learn more.  Quite odd how they ignore an actual treatment.", "I think it's definitely a thing to talk about him after it happens though. Like if she really has a blow on tries to drag him out of there, presenting to the kid that he could stay with you for the night would be nice."]}
