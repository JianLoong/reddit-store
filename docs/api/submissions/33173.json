I\u2019ve given her advice, at one point allowed her to move back in but then had to kick her back out for another of her bad choices, then tried to help her budget, find a good job, help her stay on track and it\u2019s a waste of my breath because it goes in one ear and out the other. I\u2019ve finally reached my breaking point - In the order it says \u201cat our discretion\u201d which I told her was open ended because I want her to eventually get custody back so she needs that bond with her. She\u2019s taken advantage of that by just making plans when it\u2019s convenient for her, always. We can\u2019t make plans and if we do, we have to cancel because it\u2019s always last minute that she\u2019ll say \u201cI\u2019ll be there at this time\u201d. She\u2019ll often leave early for excuses that have to do with other people. We have told her repeatedly that it isn\u2019t about her, it\u2019s about my GD and she is the #1 priority!! No matter what! \u201cNicole\u201d doesn\u2019t see that. Now she is trying to play the victim after I again tried to tell her that not seeing my GD the past two weeks is not okay. She says she\u2019s been working\u2026her job is a seasonal job and she works 4-6 hours a few days a week. But she said she\u2019s picking up shifts because she wants to better her life and save money so she is sacrificing seeing my GD to do that. But 1) we\u2019ve heard this before and she STILL has nothing to show for it and 2) we get messages that she is borrowing money from people.\n\nBack to the recent conversation we had where I said she needs to make my GD her priority when she isn\u2019t working: Ultimately she made herself the victim, called me a horrible parent and said some pretty rude and disrespectful things, again not taking responsibility for her actions (or in-actions as this case may be) and my wife and I decided to go ahead and stop the three straight years of narcissistic manipulation and drama.\n\nWe just think it\u2019s what\u2019s best for my GD not just the family, to just cut all contact until she can have open eyes to her life and really start making the best choices and decisions for my GD. \n\nSo, AITA for stopping my daughter\u2019s visitation?", "created_utc": 1702763836, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18k1p1i/aita_for_stopping_my_daughters_visitation_with/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nicole is your daughter, but an adult. The children are totally innocent in this, and you now have the responsibility of parenting young children. You have to do what\u2019s best for the grandkids, and hopefully not seeing them is enough incentive/motivation for her to turn things around.", "No. NTA at all.\n\nProtect your GD.  Make one 2 hr period at a park every week a permanent appt in your schedule between you and GD. Unless the weather is miserable, go consistently even if it's only a walk. \n\nWhen you get pushback from Nicole,  inform her that she's welcome to prioritize those 2 hrs and show up. \n\nNever tell GD that her mother is coming. If Nicole shows,  great,  if she doesn't,  no big deal. \n\nJournal everything,  as you already know. \n\nThen put Nicole on an information diet,  lock your door and mute her number so you only respond when it's convenient to you. \n\nBest of luck.", "NTA. You have custody so protect your granddaughter.", "NTA and reading some of your replies, your granddaughter is so lucky to have you in your life.  I'm so sorry that you have all these travails to deal with.  And if it's any reassurance, I know many adults who would have felt so lucky to have had a grandmother like you to protect them from their parents.  You're a wonderful human being.  It hurts to be the fierce guardian, but that's just what we have to be when children are at risk.", "NTA.  Your granddaughter is getting to the age where she's going to notice that her mother doesn't make her a priority.  If \"at your discretion\" includes stopping visitation (i.e. it's legally ok for you to cut her off) you could do it and not be TA.    \n\n\nHowever, it sounds like your main issue with the visitation is that your daughter tries to do it on short notice.  You have some choices here - 1) don't let her into your house unless she gives you X days notice or 2) give her a few hours on a fixed day and if she doesn't attend, she misses out.", "NTA. Your GD's best interests are what matter here, and the inconsistency is problematic (though I'm not sure you said NO enough when she wanted to show up at inconvenient times/ no notice, etc.). \n\nMaybe try taking their contact entirely into your hands and schedule. For instance - pick a morning/afternoon she's usually off work that's convenient for you and consider that your day to go to the park with GD. Daughter can meet you there or not, but it's all up to her to make it work.", "The very good thing is that right now your granddaughter doesn\u2019t have a sense of time or can realize it has been three weeks or three days since she has seen this person who is her mother.   I wouldn\u2019t cut off contact as long as she isn\u2019t endangering her child.  If she shows up once a month so be it, it will not hurt your granddaughter right now.  You daughter has a few years to get her life together, maybe she will, hard to say.  I wouldn\u2019t live your life or make your plans around her, since she sounds unreliable but let know what times would be best and make her feel welcome to come at those times.", "If there is going to be a relationship between your daughter and your granddaughter, there need to be visits.\n\nYou don't have permanent custody. If your daughter keeps flaking and being the reason that there aren't visits, that's on her. But don't you be the obstacle that comes between a mother and daughter.\n\nYour plan to cut all contact until you can ~~indoctrinate~~ teach your granddaughter on how bad her mom is flawed at best. You use the phrase \"until she has open eyes\". If mom is kept away from the daughter's eyes, what use is there in them being open.\n\nWhat you are proposing is intentional alienation. regardless of your frustration and whether it  is to the ultimate benefit granddaughter it is intentional alienation.\n\nIf you want your daughter permanently out of your granddaughter's life, then go to court and have her parental rights removed. Using your given discretion about the timing of visitation to end that visitation is to misuse that discretion. If you're going to remove your granddaughter from your daughter, do it straight up by getting her parental rights removed, not by this subterfuge of visitation denial.\n\nTo the extend that Reddit judgments are relevant in your situation, YTA", "ESH you can't stop all visitation i think that would be cruel, to all parties especially your GD, i like the comment of 2 hours every week and obviously if this is the wakeup call your daughter gets then to slowly increase that, full visitation ban won't be a wakeup call it will be a punishment and also an exuse for your daughter to delude herself and go 'well i had no opportunity to see my daughter because it was at my parent's discretion when  i could see her'", "ESH. At your discretion means you decide when where how long and any conditions like supervision, not whether the gets them at all.\n\nInstead of cutting her off completely, set up some rules to protect your granddaughter.  Have the visits on a predictable schedule, on a set day and time.  Make her confirm she is coming the day.  If she doesnt confirm, the visit is canceled.  If she no shows after confirming, she loses a visit. Maybe different rules would work for you. The point is to make it predictable for you and your granddaughter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We hoped it would be the push she needed. But it seems she is enjoying her freedom. It breaks my heart. The inconsistency is the reason her child doesn\u2019t know her.", "I actually think that\u2019s an amazing idea. And I\u2019d never tell her she\u2019s coming. When she does come over, there\u2019s no direct reaction\u2026just another person to visit.  I journal EVERYTHING! Screenshots, written and photos. Everything. I have too\u2026I even get screenshots from other people, even her friends.", "Thank you so much for this. It\u2019s funny because my \u201cbonus kids\u201d, the ones I\u2019ve kind of adopted over the years have said this exact same thing! One in particular, was the exact case of needing to be protected as well. \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "Yes, that\u2019s what we have tried to do multiple times. We\u2019ve set boundaries but at last minute it changes for her. Then she just pops up other times. One commenter mentioned a 2hr park visit on the same day each week and if she shows, great\u2026if not, oh well.", "Yes. I take full responsibility for not saying NO! Because I didn\u2019t want to \u201ckeep her from seeing her\u201d, even the smallest amount but with advice from others, I\u2019ve realized I\u2019m doing more harm than good.", "Okay but if op had custody of gd then it is up to her discretion to decide when she\u2019s allowed to see her kid, if she had been flaky and not around then it\u2019s safe to assume the mother doesn\u2019t have any intention on being in her kids life. I wojkd view it as similar to bringing a father around a child that picks and chooses, in the long run it can be confusing to the child on who that person is or should be to them. If the mother is flaky then she obviously isn\u2019t making an effort to be with her child by also doing things like finding excuses to leave early or not showing at all.", "First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to read my post and comment your opinion. I really appreciate all opinions and ideas. \n\n1) I have full custody of my granddaughter. In the order there is no expiration date, no \u201cif she fixes her life she can have her back\u201d, etc. i have legal and physical custody. \n\n2) Why did you use \u201cindoctrinate\u201d? I\u2019m not sure why that is a word any one would use in this situation. I may have not been clear enough in the description of the situation due too needing to keep it to 3,000 words/characters. My daughter is only doing what she wants and living her life with the freedom of not having children while in turn just being here when she feels like it. I feel like it\u2019s just not healthy for my GD to have that inconsistency.\n\n3) The \u201cuntil she had open eyes\u201d was towards my daughter. Until she opens her eyes to how she\u2019s living her life, the path she\u2019s on (parties, drugs, not holding a job, different boyfriends etc). THAT is what I was meaning.", "We\u2019ve tried a couple different things and it works for a short period of time until she finds something that interests her more or she finds a boyfriend. Then my GD disappears from her mind\u2026One of the commenters gave an idea of a 2hr time slot one specific day every week at a park, if she shows, great and if not oh well!! No harm, no foal!!", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this situation. I know it must be heartbreaking to see your child off track. I hope you have support around you.", "Yep. I think it's on JustNoMIL sub they describe the FU binder.", "I had someone like you in my life decades ago, and though my home situation was very different in its particular dangers, she was very much needed.  She helped me heal and thrive, and to raise my own child and now grandchildren with that mix of fierce protection and a generous heart.  Hundreds of students have benefited from my fierce protector back in the day as well.  I am sure that the good you are doing will ripple out in ways you cannot even imagine.  Thank you.", "Oh I do. I\u2019m surrounded by our \u201cvillage\u201d. So many friends and family to help us with all of this. It\u2019s been hard to see my daughter go through what she\u2019s putting herself through, then trying to keep her in her daughter\u2019s life\u2026despite her actions showing she doesn\u2019t want to be. But my GD is doing amazing, she\u2019s happy and healthy.", "It sounds like you\u2019re doing a great job. Stay strong, you\u2019re doing the right thing and I hope one day she will be grateful for the sacrifices you made to care for her children.", "Thank you. I really appreciate that. My wife and kids tell me all the time I\u2019m doing what\u2019s right, but my heart breaks. Especially when my daughter reacts by saying I\u2019m a horrible mom, I\u2019m the reason she\u2019s like she is (which is 100% not true). I know she\u2019s an adult and is making her own choices but it gets me to doubt myself. I have 4 other kids and multiple bonus kids I\u2019ve \u201cadopted\u201d, which hilariously are her former friends, who tell me she\u2019s full of it and the things she says aren\u2019t true. It\u2019s been a struggle for sure."]}
