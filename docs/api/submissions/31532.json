This year my sister-in-law(f27) and her wife\u2019s(f28) family offered to host thanksgiving. My husband and I agree that they are not the best cooks and they are demanding they do the cooking, they always underbake the casseroles and it\u2019s too soupy, we offered to help with the cooking and they denied it. Despite knowing I\u2019ll have to politely pretend I like the food I was okay with going, until SIL calls my husband and asks when we are taking her shopping for thanksgiving so we can pay for the groceries, she wanted about $200 in my food stamps. I\u2019m on food stamps because I\u2019m poor and SIL has a nice job and her wife\u2019s family is very wealthy and well off, I told my husband to tell her no. We couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to give it because I don\u2019t have that much money, I\u2019m pregnant and we have a child, the money runs out quick. Then later MIL(f57) called us up and asked us to at least give the rest of our stamps towards the thanksgiving, I said no way, I will not give my last dollars towards a meal I\u2019m barely going to eat because they\u2019re bad cooks, and make myself go hungry. They definitely have the means to pay for it themselves. MIL said I need to stop eating so much and spending the food stamps, fyi the stamps are in my name only. Then MIL proceeded to complain that I\u2019m basically the reason that she has to give the 200 herself and that I\u2019m putting her through a hard time by not contributing. I am offended that they would act like they\u2019re entitled to the food stamps. So I\u2019m decided I won\u2019t bring my child to their thanksgiving and I\u2019m having my own with just my husband and our child, I used the last $40 on the food stamps that I had and was able to get a turkey and all the sides with coupons. I don\u2019t want to go to their thanksgiving this year but my husband does, should I just let bygones be bygones and bring my family to their thanksgiving and have our own with good food after?", "created_utc": 1700710789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181s0vo/aita_for_being_offended_when_asked_to_pay_for/", "score": 812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Buying food for someone outside the approved household is recipient fraud. It isn't just about selling or trading. Those funds are for you and the people who were approved on the application. That's it. Otherwise, you are using taxpayer money for others it was not intended for. Misappropriation of taxpayer dollars, which is fraud.\n\nETA: \n\n>Title 7 U.S. Code 2024, which says, \u201c\u2026. whoever knowingly uses, transfers, acquires, alters, or possesses benefits in any manner contrary to this chapter or the regulations, shall, if benefits are of a value of $5,000 or more, be guilty of a felony\u2026. if such benefits are of a value of $100 or more, but less than $5,000, or if the item used, transferred, acquired, altered, or possessed is a benefit that has a value of $100 or more, be guilty of a felony\u2026 if such benefits are of a value of less than $100, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor\u2026.\n[https://www.thefederalcriminalattorneys.com/food-stamp-fraud](https://www.thefederalcriminalattorneys.com/food-stamp-fraud)\n\nIt doesn't have to be just trading or selling. It is also using or acquiring. OP would be using, and her in-laws would be acquiring.", "It IS illegal. The SNAP program (formally food stamps) is funded by the USDA. Individual states help run the program, but it is a federal program funded by taxpayers. This would fall under recipient fraud if OP did what they asked. These rules are the same no matter what state because it is a federal program. \n\n[SNAP Fraud](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/fraud)", "Normal logic????? Obviously it wouldn't be very good.", "I thought so. I\u2019m not American and it doesn\u2019t work the same way here, but I was pretty sure that was some kind of felony or what have you.", "$200 is if we went wild at Costco", "The person who applied, regardless of the head of household or who is in the home, is whose name is on the card. It covers all eligible household members. OP and her child, and presumably her husband. But that's it. No one else. \n\nSome states (maybe all, but I don't know off the top of my head) issue stamps at different times of the month. My state issues by first letter of last name. I'm in the group that gets stamps on the 11th of every month. Others get theirs after me. Also, if you're poor enough, you're swimming in food stamps and can have leftovers. It's quite possible she has some at this point in the month.", "We used to have +20 people for Christmas at one point. Every family that came brought a meat + side or a pudding. The singles or couples would bring a bottle or two of champagne.\n\nThat worked out pretty well.", "It's ok to expect guests to pay if the hosts are unable to fund the entire meal and/or if host duties always fall to the same person (eg. only one person has a dining room large enough). HOWEVER. It then needs to be AGREED UPON by ALL parties IN ADVANCE.\n\nAsking for someones food stamps (unless all attendees are on food stamps and it's an agreed upon way of splitting costs) is just horrible.", "This, yes. If this were a potluck thing, as you say, or there were some general agreement that all guests pay a small amount to offset the total cost, sure. But demanding one person give you 200$ out of their food stamps? I'd nope out of that, fast.", "Pot luck. I like it \ud83d\udc4d\n\nHere I do the potato bake. \ud83d\ude01 It's hot this end of the year in Australia and we don't do Thanksgiving obviously but I was drawing the closest comparison in my mind with Christmas. Lot of seafood and salads and fruit platters. Bring your own meat for the bbq. Job done. \n\nBest way to do it. Bring some alcohol if you want and the host usually supplies the soft drink (soda ? ). \n\nSounds like your family has a great arrangement. Got hungry reading it \ud83d\ude01", "Right back at ya my souppropriate friend!", "So in your brain, food that doesn't taste as good isn't as nutritious?", "In my state, and the surrounding states, it's the first of the month for everyone. It's why the grocery stores are packed every 1st. Another busy day is Wednesday because that's when social security payments are deposited.", "Fr. If they are all struggling, it would have been a better plan to go a pot luck style to offset the strain on everyone. NTA OP. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck with such inconsiderate in laws that would want to see their grandbabies go hungry."]}
