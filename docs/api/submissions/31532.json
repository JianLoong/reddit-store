This year my sister-in-law(f27) and her wife\u2019s(f28) family offered to host thanksgiving. My husband and I agree that they are not the best cooks and they are demanding they do the cooking, they always underbake the casseroles and it\u2019s too soupy, we offered to help with the cooking and they denied it. Despite knowing I\u2019ll have to politely pretend I like the food I was okay with going, until SIL calls my husband and asks when we are taking her shopping for thanksgiving so we can pay for the groceries, she wanted about $200 in my food stamps. I\u2019m on food stamps because I\u2019m poor and SIL has a nice job and her wife\u2019s family is very wealthy and well off, I told my husband to tell her no. We couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to give it because I don\u2019t have that much money, I\u2019m pregnant and we have a child, the money runs out quick. Then later MIL(f57) called us up and asked us to at least give the rest of our stamps towards the thanksgiving, I said no way, I will not give my last dollars towards a meal I\u2019m barely going to eat because they\u2019re bad cooks, and make myself go hungry. They definitely have the means to pay for it themselves. MIL said I need to stop eating so much and spending the food stamps, fyi the stamps are in my name only. Then MIL proceeded to complain that I\u2019m basically the reason that she has to give the 200 herself and that I\u2019m putting her through a hard time by not contributing. I am offended that they would act like they\u2019re entitled to the food stamps. So I\u2019m decided I won\u2019t bring my child to their thanksgiving and I\u2019m having my own with just my husband and our child, I used the last $40 on the food stamps that I had and was able to get a turkey and all the sides with coupons. I don\u2019t want to go to their thanksgiving this year but my husband does, should I just let bygones be bygones and bring my family to their thanksgiving and have our own with good food after?", "created_utc": 1700710789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181s0vo/aita_for_being_offended_when_asked_to_pay_for/", "score": 1630, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The average is about $129 per person.", "Agree, they treat it like a shared resource to which they are entitled whatever portion they think is appropriate.", "Who tells a pregnant woman to stop eating ? \n\nMIL is crazy and husband should shut down all of this nonsense really quickly.", "The spirit of thanksgiving.", "[removed]", "I agree. NTA.", "Rich people don\u2019t get that way spending money. They get that way getting other people to pay for things.", "I think that is why they asked her to go shopping with them. So she is technically buying the food. But, this is just such a ridiculous situation.", "Same, but I likely would've read them the riot act first.  Last time that happened, my mom joined less than 2 seconds later with the yelling.  I don't care if you're my sister or not, you DO NOT tell me I can't use the child I lost as an excuse. \n\nI was leaving because I was getting emotional about it and that gem came out of my sister's mouth.  (The painkillers from back surgery didn't make her say that. ) That phrase that someone saw red?  Oh yeah, I saw it, quite literally.  My youngest sister was next to her on the loveseat and visibly inched away from her before BOTH Mom and I started screaming at her.  Dad has hearing aids, didn't have them in, was upstairs, and heard us.  I'm sure the NEIGHBORS heard us.", "What you can't eat can't be nutritious. That's wtf kinda logic.", "Honestly, most of the situations on AITA are of people who make consistently poor decisions.  They have babies with baby daddies before the age of 21, they never marry or have committed relationships, if there is a stepparent situation it's always distant and full of hatred, and of course no one uses birth control so they bring more babies into this mess.  Not speaking of this poster specifically, but in general.", "Yep. It is the children's right that their PARENTS provide them with good life that comes with nutritious food, quality education, secured home, and medication if needed. And all of that won't happen if the parents are not emotionally, mentally and financially stable.", "It's relevant because they brought it up. Considering we are paying to raise her kids because they're too dumb to learn from their first mistake yeah. Her family is trash and perhaps hasn't been told that she's fucking up", "very true! My offspring have finally accepted that I'm not following the gluten free craze. Before I was diagnosed I ate a lot of baked goods and LOVED bread. they kept referring to those days. I had to remind them of all the distress I used to go through and the myriad of doctors", "Why are they so entitled to your food stamps? Because they pay taxes? SNAP is notorious for not even being enough for a lot of families! WTH", "NTA - if they wanted to host, they are volunteering to pay for it, just as you did in the past. I am guessing you were not on SNAP at the time.", "Have you hosted in the past?  How did you pay for it?", "Poor young and pregnant AGAIN....this person is poor because they're fucking stupid", "Because she's going to subject two (I reread, she already has one! Ugh) innocent kids to a lifetime of poverty, that's why. They don't deserve to be in that position against their will.", "Seriously. I cannot imagine a middle aged parent telling the mother of their grandchildren to \"eat less, so I can eat more\"! That's bananas. Also, assuming that OP is in the US based on her post, SNAP/food stamps covers a good deal but it definitely doesn't cover everything and groceries in the US are insanely priced right now.", "Why isn't OPs husband shutting down his own mother?  Why did OP have to deal with this entitled mouthpiece?  It would take more than an apology for me to get over this situation -- I have a feeling this isn't out of character for MIL. Hubby needs to grow a pair. edit OP is definitely NTA but husband's family sure are (and her husband is teetering on the asshole border).", "Some folks seem to think of it as \u201cmonopoly\u201d money.  Like it\u2019s just free coupons or something.  Crazy.", "You mean, at least she hasn't tried to take OP's land and infected her with smallpox?", "It is a celebration of murder and thievery so\u2026", "OMG, my mom's broccoli dish.  I can't wait for the meal later!  That's what everyone gets seconds of.  It goes FAST.  Never any leftovers.", "We were stable when my husband and I decided to start our family at a little over their age. Then he abruptly became disabled while I was pregnant. We needed assistance for years while I worked and he went to school to be able to work again.   \n\n\nI put up with a lot of judgy bullshit from people like this. Everyone deserves adequate nutrition and in a world where we produce enough food to feed around 10 billion people, no one should go hungry.", "Sometimes that means the parents access public resources so they can provide that good nutritious food, quality education, secure home and medicine.", "Well sometimes those pallets of Sweet Baby Ray\u2019s are necessary amirite?", "For real. I'm on SNAP and still have to go to the local pantry most months. My daughter's school just got a new building this year, which doesn't have a working kitchen, so I also have to send lunch with her 5 days / week. I scratch by using ibotta, but only barely.", "The standard behavior is that if you can\u2019t afford to host, you don\u2019t offer to host.", "I fully agree. She has a husband problem, before a MIL and SIL problem.", "I would tell my husband to go -have a great time. I\u2019m not quite sure how one person gets food stamps in the home? And isn\u2019t the mother-in-law concerned about her grandchild or is the oldest child not the husbands? There\u2019s something weird about the story. The husband is the asshole- and his family is toxic.", "Well, she is his mother and he does want to spend the holiday with them. He is no doubt accustomed to his mother's bad cooking and doesn't mind it. \n\nPretty sad though, if people who can afford it would ask their less affluent family member to pay for the meal with their food stamps.", "Tbf, undercooked food *isn't* as nutritious.", "Food she doesn\u2019t eat isn\u2019t nutritious", "Yes, situations like yours do happen but OP doesn't mention anything like that.  I think it's the choice to have *another* child while on public assistance that is seen as problematic.  I would hope no one begrudges a child (or adult) food, but adding another family member when you can't support the ones you already have doesn't seem like the basis for a stable, healthy environment.", "Beat me to it. Exactly my thought. Why would he want to even talk to people who told the pregnant lady not to eat? HES also on food stamps and this would be his food being stolen from him and his pregnant wife. OP needs to sit hubby down and show him this post. \n\nHey OPS HUSBAND: YOUR WIFE WAS SERIOUSLY DISRESPECTED AND YOUR EVIL SISTER AND MOM WANTED TO STEAL FOOD FROM YOUR MOUTHS. GROW A PAIR AND STAND BY YOUR WIFE", "Mothers are often able to access help like food stamps more easily through programs specifically designed to help them, so that may be how she gets them. I also don't know exactly how food stamps typically work, but your income for welfare programs is usually verified through taxes, so if she and her husband file together, then the food stamps would be both of theirs.", "I think it was OPs sister & partner cooking the dinner but irrelevant, her inlaws all sound like entitled *not very nice* people and if her husband chose to spend the holiday with them, so be it....but he likely wouldn't be *my* husband for long.", "Still doesn\u2019t give every random asshole the right to demand justification for your situation.", "I don't think the other poster \"demanded justification,\" they just asked OP (who notably hasn't responded) why they wanted to have another child when they couldn't support one they already had.", "That\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re doing."]}
