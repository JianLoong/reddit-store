This year my sister-in-law(f27) and her wife\u2019s(f28) family offered to host thanksgiving. My husband and I agree that they are not the best cooks and they are demanding they do the cooking, they always underbake the casseroles and it\u2019s too soupy, we offered to help with the cooking and they denied it. Despite knowing I\u2019ll have to politely pretend I like the food I was okay with going, until SIL calls my husband and asks when we are taking her shopping for thanksgiving so we can pay for the groceries, she wanted about $200 in my food stamps. I\u2019m on food stamps because I\u2019m poor and SIL has a nice job and her wife\u2019s family is very wealthy and well off, I told my husband to tell her no. We couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to give it because I don\u2019t have that much money, I\u2019m pregnant and we have a child, the money runs out quick. Then later MIL(f57) called us up and asked us to at least give the rest of our stamps towards the thanksgiving, I said no way, I will not give my last dollars towards a meal I\u2019m barely going to eat because they\u2019re bad cooks, and make myself go hungry. They definitely have the means to pay for it themselves. MIL said I need to stop eating so much and spending the food stamps, fyi the stamps are in my name only. Then MIL proceeded to complain that I\u2019m basically the reason that she has to give the 200 herself and that I\u2019m putting her through a hard time by not contributing. I am offended that they would act like they\u2019re entitled to the food stamps. So I\u2019m decided I won\u2019t bring my child to their thanksgiving and I\u2019m having my own with just my husband and our child, I used the last $40 on the food stamps that I had and was able to get a turkey and all the sides with coupons. I don\u2019t want to go to their thanksgiving this year but my husband does, should I just let bygones be bygones and bring my family to their thanksgiving and have our own with good food after?", "created_utc": 1700710789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181s0vo/aita_for_being_offended_when_asked_to_pay_for/", "score": 262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can instead say \"let's have Thanksgiving in  our house, everyone can chip in for groceries and we will cook\", that's a fine arrangement, but then you aren't the sole host, and you should also consult people on what they want to buy and agree on a budget. You do not simply demand a certain amount from guests,  and also the cost should be split per person, not fall on one of the guests.", "If he goes he should get his own damn meal on his way home.

It's polite for guests to offer to bring a dish, but even that isn't required. The only exception is potluck and everybody contributes food, never money", "In my family, the \"host\" is just the family with a big enough house and some time this week to clean up for the party. Everything is a giant potluck. The host family tends to buy the turkey because it takes more prep leading up to the day, but we all bring sides, apps, desserts, beverages, and games. The family members from far out of town usually bring something small and store bought, or just chip in a bit if they can. Those of us in town tend to cook. My two uncles each have large houses with big entertaining spaces, but that doesn't mean they should be out the entire cost of the meal for 40 people for every holiday. They sort of alternate, depending on whose work schedule is more cramped the week before the holiday.\n\nIt's family for a major holiday, not a formal dinner party for your birthday. They didn't invite each of us specifically by name. They sent a group text with the time for dinner, and we all chime in with what we are bringing. If someone can't make it, we send well wishes and see them next time. \n\nI know other families do it differently but it isn't rude at all for a family to spread the cost of the holiday meal out. We all want to get together. We all want to see each other. We all want to share delicious food and joyous company. It isn't my uncle treating us all, he's just hosting it in his house. We are all throwing the party. \n\nIf a family wants to do it differently, by all means! I'm not saying our way is the only right way. Just saying that yours isn't the only objectively proper way either.", "At least in the US, it's not considered right, but I don't like that societal norm, as it puts pressure on people to spend money they don't have. Crowdsourcing the food for a large holiday hosted at one person's house makes far more sense than putting the stress of hosting on one household along with the costs of all the food.", "Not everyone can afford to feed a large extended family.  \n\nBe thankful you have never had to consider this.", "\"Hosting a meal and hosting a potluck/other arrangement are two different things, and the invitation should be clear beforehand\"\n\nYes absolutely, I was talking more generally not about OP specific situation. \n\nIn this case OP is NTA. \n\nIf it is going to be an everyone chips in situation it should be talked about beforehand and a budget set, $x per person etc... Mainly just wanted to point out that not being able too/not wanting to host and pay for the meal makes a person a bad host. \n\nIn this case SIL is being a bad host by being a bad cook, expecting OP to pay for all of it, and not talking about this more on advance.", "Considering they told a pregnant 20 year old with a child to \"stop eating so much\" so she'd hand over her food stamps?  You can guarantee it", "Potluck! ;)", "Then they shouldn\u2019t have volunteered to host if they can\u2019t afford to.", "Potluck for sure! When we had large Thanksgiving celebrations with rotating hosts, the host would prepare the turkey, provide drinks and whatever their speciality was...that could be a casserole or stuffing or pie. Then everyone else would bring a side dish. It was nice because we all got to have a bit of everyone's cooking and it didn't put a dent into anyone's bank account. \nSince our families have unfortunately gotten much smaller, whoever hosts provides everything unless they want us to being something specific. I have never been to a Thanksgiving at a family's home with a fucking cover charge. \nOP, you're NTA. They want to use your food stamps to get out of buying the food that they can afford. That's absolutely ridiculous. You're pregnant and have a child already and you need those stamps. If I were you, I'd stay home and if your husband wants to go he can go alone. You can have a nice comfy night in all to yourself."]}
