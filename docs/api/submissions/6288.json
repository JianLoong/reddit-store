Sure, he is going to make mistakes but it's his life. You will be permanently damaging your relationship with your son by choosing not to attend his wedding. Just like your son though, you too are allowed to make mistakes I guess.", "He may be young, but he's old enough to make his choices (or mistakes). However you may hate his choices, If you miss his wedding, you might as well say goodbye to your son. Is a difference of opinion worth losing one of your children over? Suck it up, go to the wedding, give him your blessing and let him live his own life. YTA", "YATA, even if you don't like the idea of your child getting out of med school is his decision and you should appreciate he invited you to the wedding. He for sure will love to see you in one of his specials days, the material things are not that much important.\n\nI undertand you are not happy with the idea, but the only thing you can do is tell him and leave him do what he thinks is the good choise after your advice. Maybe he will realize in a future, maybe no and gets a good future. But at least he knew he had you always by his side.", "YTA. I wasn't sure until I got to the punchline. I really can't believe you are being like this with them. You do realise that you can delay medical school but not death, don't you?", "Yta \n\nYou are an adult. There is no need to act like a child.", "This reads like a badly written Netflix video.\n\n\nHe is an adult and so are you. Both of you are able to make your own decisions. Thing is will you be able to live with the consequences of your decision? \n\n\nYou not being there for him no matter how you feel about his decision is something he will always remember. He will remember it on his wedding day, he will remember it each anniversary l, he will remember it when she passes away and he probably will remember it when he proposes to his next partner that you doubtfully will never meet. He may even remember it the day he names his first child, the one that you will never know. Because at one stage we all realize that we would rather remove those individuals that never had our backs, that never supported us,  that only saw the worst in others,  out of our lives for good. \n\n\nAwful lot to possibly miss out on because you want to show him you know better than him. \n\n\nYTA.", "YTA - also, once Beth passes, it will be almost impossible to rebuild your relationship with Jack. He will always remember how you rejected his relationship with his dying wife. Once she\u2019s gone, you will have lost your chance to make things right with her. He will likely always resent you for that and rightfully so.", "YTA\n\nJack is an adult that can make his own choices. \n\nYou say he is throwing away his future by taking a LOA from med school to marry Beth.  If he truly loves her, which it sounds like he does, Beth is more important to his future than his career. \n\nAs his parents its fine to give him advice, but you should be supporting him in whatever decision he is making. \n\nIf you choose to go ahead and skip his wedding, abandon any future you hopes for a continued relationship with him.  I would consider that throwing away your future.", "YTA", " He's taking a leave of absence not quitting.\nShe's dying they don't have the option to wait.\n\n\"He's too young\" he's 25?

You won't, you've shown him who you really are now and that's what he'll remember.\n\n\"Jack's stubborn\" where did he get that from I wonder? You. You are 10x worse.

At least you put it in the edit. Support your son now, otherwise it will be your fault if he eventually stops talking to you.", "Yta. Your son fell in love with a girl and wants to marry her even though she is dying. Med school will be there in the future - the girl won't. And if this is how you behave you will also have lost your son.", "YTA. Your son is a grown man. He shouldn't need your approval of how he goes about his love life for you to emotionally support him on one of the biggest days of his life. Maybe they get divorced, maybe they don't. My parents knew each other for 3 months before engagement and another 3 before they were married. They are still happily married nearly 30 years later. My grandparents had serious reservations but they still showed up. Imagine their regret if they hadn't.\n\nEDIT: his fiancee is terminally ill and you only felt to include that in the main text of the post after people caught in your bot response? You're such an AH. The biggest AH. How can you be so heartless?", "YTA. Burying the lead on his fiancee being terminally ill. He gets to make adult choices as an adult. Between the pandemic, medical school and her diagnosis, its understandable that you haven't gotten to know her. Try now. For better or worse, your son is going to experience joy and trauma so who else do you want him to turn to for support if he doesn't turn to you?", "Jack is not a child, he is a 25 year old grown man. Beth might only be 21, but she is also an adult. What exactly is your problem with letting Jack be an adult? He\u2019s old enough to know his own mind.\n\nThe fact that Beth is dying only makes this even worse.\n\nYou\u2019re well on track for losing your son too.\n\nYTA", "YTA. I'm sure this situation is already hard enough for your son without dealing with you acting like a child.", "YTA. Your not going to your sons possibly only wedding in his life becasue hes making a decision about school that you don't want him to make. Separate the two things. You can go to the wedding and also talk to him about leaving school. They're not connected.", "Nice just omitting the little fact that the girl has **TERMINAL CANCER.**\n\n#The LOA is going to be used taking care of his DYING WIFE in her final days! \n\nYTA. It\u2019s his life and his choice and his alone to make. That she has terminal cancer just shoved you into Mega AH territory.", "YTA.\n\nThey love each other, and the terminal cancer also sets a terminal limit on how much time they can spend together, since it won't be spread over a typical lifetime.\n\nYour son can continue med school, but CAN'T get more time with Beth.", "YTA\n\nYou would not be encouraging him. You would be supporting him as an adult even though you disagree with his decisions. You would be showing you love him unconditionally. You would be being there for him on what could be the most important day of his life, to him.\n\nAs another note, it's entirely possible that he's struggling with medical school or has decided it's not for him. He may have been looking for a reason to take a LOA or drop out and has been scared of your response - as you have now proven him right. He has been with this girl for 2 years; it's not like they met last week, it's clearly a serious relationship not an \"emotional impulse\" and as a smart guy I've no doubt he's spent a lot of time thinking this through. Your response has made sure he won't confide in you if there is something else going on and he's decided not to pursue a medical career.\n\nYou are showing him, and your other kids, that they need to live their life the way you think they should, or you won't be there for them.", "NTA", "YTA. You hid the information that Beth is terminally ill\u2026of course that makes a difference. So what if your son loses a year or two of medical school? He\u2019ll still be a doctor eventually. To boycott their wedding over this is beyond the pale. What are you going to do when she passes\u2026boycott the funeral or show up like Mr. & Mrs. Concerned Parents? Neither will be a good look for you and your wife. Shame on you both.", "Info: I see it in a comment to the bot, but not in your post. She's terminal? She's dying?", "YTA. Keep this up and your children will go NC with you and your wife. This is Jack\u2019s life, whether you like the decisions or not. When you have children part of the job is to be there for them through anything. His LOA from med school should not upset you this much. You\u2019re not going to med school. I can see why you only met Beth twice. You choose not to be there for an important day for your son because of your ego and it\u2019s gross. I hope Jack never talks to you again", "What good does not going to the wedding do? You've already let him know you don't support his choice, but by not going you're just going to wind up alienating your son.\n\nYTA", "Yes YTA, your sons soon to be wife is dying and you're being a b**** bout it. How cruel can you be, instead of supporting him, you do this, his life will be he'll once she dies.. show some fucking empathy for your child.", "YTA\n\nDont throw away any relationship with your kid.\n\nIT IS his choice to be there for his terminaly ill wife.\n\nhe can always go back to med shool or whatever he wants in the end.", "YTA, but you already know it. That\u2019s why you left out your future DIL\u2019s diagnosis from original post.", "YTA. You raised a son with an amazing heart who wants to care for and support the woman he loves when most people would run away. You should be proud of him. Get you head out of your ass and support him.", "See\u2026here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s not just \u201ca wedding\u201d. It\u2019s their lives, their kids, the rest of your relationship for your life with your child. He will always chose his wife which he has made abundantly clear. And whether or not he takes a LOA, or never goes back shouldn\u2019t matter. You are prioritizing a career over happiness which is gross. The fact that your younger children introduced you to this thread tells you exactly where they think you stand that you need internet strangers to tell you that you are absolutely an AH and need to check yourself. YTA.", "You conveniently leave out that Beth is terminally ill in the main post but not in the judgement bot reply. I'm guessing that the LOA from medical school is planned for her late stage illness where she'll be, you know, DYING. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Jfc. She's DYING. You not going to this wedding isn't just you discouraging your son from making decisions (of which your opinion is meaningless); you not going shows your son that you love him CONDITIONALLY. ie, the opposite of what a good parent does.", "YTA: He will never forget that you weren\u2019t there for him when he needed you the most. He is about to go through the most wrenching, heartbreaking emotional experience of his life and you won\u2019t even show up for the *least* sad day of that. You are the worst.", "YTA. You don't have to agree with his decision, but don't wreck your relationship with your son over this. Show up, plaster on a fake smile and be supportive. Calling it 'nonsense' was dismissive and obnoxious of you.\n\nMarrying young doesn't mean he's not going to finish college or that he's 'throwing away his future', but well done for the hyperbole. Two of my uni friends married in first year (both 18) - now in their 30s, both finished their degrees, once has a masters and they're both doing great.

OP is a monster.", "I wonder, why did this GF of 2 years never come over for xmas, parents birthdays, other holidays. Was she not invited? Did she choose to decline the invite? Did the son come over in that time? \n\nIt is normal that you introduce your serious GF to your parents and meet them one-on-one (or 2-on-2). Especially as soon as you think about marriage. There are a bazillion reasons not to do that. But it's far beyond normal, and glossing over this part is weird.", "You realise the fianc\u00e9 is dying right??", "Bro I missed that until I saw this comment. That makes this situation so much worse. Now I feel like OP intentionally left it out of the main text of the post.", "Apparently the LOA Jack's taking is meant to be used to be with Beth in her death bed. OP cold not be a biggest AH!!! YTA, OP!!!", "I'd already agree with you anyways, maybe a little closer to N A H, but OP also conveniently didn't include the fact that the fiance is terminal and he's doing this to support her in her final days. This is straight out heartless of OP.", "It\u2019s worse because Beth is terminally ill. She likely won\u2019t get to have children or even have a very long life.", "Beth is also terminally ill. She\u2019s not too young. If she waits until she\u2019s any older, it may be too late.", "It doesn\u2019t suck. Beth is dying. Jack is being kind, compassionate, and loving. Unlike OP.", "His fiance is literally dying. \n\n\nAlso he isn't quitting and more just taking a break.", "It\u2019s worse. Beth is dying. Jack is being incredibly loving, caring, and selfless by marrying her and taking a LOA to spend the remaining time she has with her. These are admirable qualities, NOT something to judge.", "Does your fiancee have terminal cancer too?", "OH MY GOD.\n\nThank you for being the first comment I saw, love it that OP doesn't consider that pertinent information!!!!", "He isn\u2019t dropping out. He\u2019s taking a LOA to care for an spend time with his terminally ill SO. He will go back to school, but he has a limited amount of time with Beth.", "OP says in reply to the judgment bot that the fiancee is terminally ill.", "It\u2019s not stupid. Beth is dying.", "She edited the original post.", "Well apparently according to her response to the bot it sounds like this girl is suffering from a terminal illness. \"she's terminal\" is what OP said. In which case, OP is straight up heartless.", "The fiance is termanilly ill. So yes, this will not have a happy end.", "The real kicker is he fiancee is terminal. To him, she's too young to marry, but this could be hr late stages in life. Op is TA big time.", "Not attending the wedding is straight up childish.", "I saw that after I posted my comment. OP is the definition of AH.", "A billion percent! But of course having a prestigious, well-paying career and marrying at what society deems an appropriate age is more important than courage, love and compassion.", "Dang he should've put that in the main body.  It's odd he left it out.", "Found it, thanks for pointing it out", "[deleted]", "The grind/hustle career mindset is so fucking toxic that it\u2019s making people like OP question spending time with a dying loved one. Fucking hell.", "1000% - its a totally different story when you add that information.", "You could edit your comment. \n\n\nIt was in response to the bot.", "Sure, thank you"]}
