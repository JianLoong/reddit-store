That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous.\n\nIf anything were to happen to one of those kids like choking or falling down the stairs or some other injury that required more than an 11 year old\u2019s knowledge of the world, that \u201ctrust\u201d those parents have for you would evaporate and you would be liable for a lot more than wounds.\n\nI hope you have good insurance.", "There was two of them!!!", "If you haven't had the talk with him yet, talk with him now. And I think if you don't want to make illegal kid intimacy videos in the future remove the camera in his room. He will have it one day or another, educate instead of strict rules.", "I had a rule about my children not having guests over when I wasn't there either.\n\nBut it wasn't just girls.  It was everyone.\n\nMy mindset was that I could trust my children home alone, but not to be responsible with their idiot friends.\n\nIt turns out I was wrong.  My children could be idiots all on their own without friends over. \n\n:-}", "I am a tween parent and I APPLAUD your common sense approach. Adolescents are notorious for having impulse control. I hear too many stories about children who aren\u2019t properly supervised in similar settings. It\u2019s extremely concerning and upsetting to me as a mom of a 12 year old girl. Your children need your guidance and you\u2019re doing a service to them to keep them out of trouble!", "I\u2019m gonna get crucified for this but NTA \nYou\u2019re trying to be a responsible parent and try to set a boundary regarding having the opposite sex over I see that but maybe next time word it better I personally would not allow my daughter to be alone with either a boy or a girl for safety reasons kids should be supervised at all times regardless. Do not use \u201chormones\u201d as an excuse like it\u2019s a weakness or\nSomething you could of said \u201c the reason is because I\u2019m not comfortable with this due to safety reasons I believe there should be supervision as I don\u2019t really know them that well\u201d etc", "NTA, people here are goddamn wild telling you to teach your ELEVEN  year old kid about sex and then letting him be alone with girls. Like what? At that age I was busy playing videogames and learning English.\n\nWait until he is at least 13/14 to have that conversation and even then, I wouldn't want him alone in the house with girls.", "NTA. He wasn\u2019t at all implying the girls are in the wrong or sexualising them.\nHe\u2019s also protecting BOTH his son and the girls.\n\nWe don\u2019t want to hear it, but it DOES happen irrespective of all the talks. It happened to me, I was harassed by a 11/12 year old boy and a friend of mine harassed by a young girl.\nIt does happen, he\u2019s trying to be responsible.", "I was going for an N T A but due to the lack of trust based soley on gender I have to go with a mild YTA. No 11 year old would randomly decide that they wanted to have literal sex with their gaming partner. If you'd be fairer and enforce rules for all sexes then it'd be okay but my God are you lacking trust toward, mind you an 11 year old child.  This is just going to cause your teen son to become rebellious and you're going to end up causing the problem you're trying to stop", "YTA. OP sounds like an awful person based on his comments.", "YTA. Honestly OP sounds like an awful person based on his comments.", "What if your son is gay and not attracted to those girls but his friends instead? YTA. Become a better teacher.\n\nEdit : If you're not gonna take any advice given to you in this sub and are gonna argue and debate with everyone in this sub, then there's no point in you posting here.", "I had to scroll up to check the age of your son. He\u2019s 11 not 16. I\u2019d imagine most 11 year olds are more interested in video games than having sex with the 12 year old next door. \n\nWell done in portraying yours and the neighbours kids as some sex crazed fiends, I\u2019m sure they appreciate hearing what you think about their daughters. \n\nAlso, what if your son was gay, does that mean he\u2019s not allowed his male friends round as well?\n\nYou obviously don\u2019t trust your son as much as you say you do.\n\nYTA", "I don't think the rule in and of itself is AH behaviour, but YTA for not telling your son the rule before you decided to enforce it. \n\nI had almost the exact same situation growing up - my best friend who lived across the street and was a girl wasn't allowed over unless adults were home. I don't think the rule is unreasonable (although there was nothing even remotely romantic between me and her, not least because she was gay) but you should've told your son FIRST.", "Your answers reek of misogyny and no basic understanding of how sex ed works. You really think an 11 year old will seduce your son. 'Girls go through puberty a lot faster'? I'll have you know boys are far more likely to think about sex at this age because of their constant exposure to porn, which girls do not generally view as much. That however is not right, they're literal children and their possible desire to have sex stems not from their urges, but their exposure to sex without fully understanding it.\n\nThat's where sex ed comes in, you ridiculous man.", "Exactly this!", "According to OP its fine becuase OP is gay and son has only mentioned crushes on girls and OP knows son isn't gay or bi despite having done stuff with boys.", "But he\u2019s said his son has \u201cdone stuff\u201d with other boys. His logic is completely off.", "Why did you ask AITA if you had already decided your position and won't listen to the majority of people? Please listen or stop wasting time. You are not a super human, you will not always be right, that is ok.", "Look while you\u2019re not an AH for not wanting your son home alone with a teenage girl, because yes teenage hormones are very strong. You cannot stop your kid having sex. And if you just deny it\u2019s happening and don\u2019t teach him not only how to not prevent pregnancy but also sexual diseases you are only putting him at risk. You need to get over whatever thoughts you have about sex and do right by your child. This is a chance for you be open and honest with your son. \nJust to let you know 12/13 year olds have sex. More often than you think.", "I hate to break it to you. I worked at an all girls summer camp for many years and we had to change up the cabin rosters more than once because someone walked in on 2 \"straight\" girls making out or having sex in their bunk. And these were all girls from \"respectable\" rich families. They just got a lecture on how it was inappropriate to bang your friend at camp with other people around and moved to a different cabin. So, your son might just as easily be having a circle jerk with his little guy friends.", "Your son could just as easily be having sex with his male friends- they have hormones, too", "I see what you\u2019re saying, and it does make sense, but at the same time I\u2019ve been left with boys many times as a teenager, and nothing happened, nor were they weird about it. Is it something you personally experienced? Genuinely curious as to wether hormones impact boys that much, and thank you for answering :))", "Yeah I was gonna say. Bold of him to assume his son is straight and isn't getting up to shenanigans with guy friends. Back when we dated my ex told me a little tale about trying to bottom at Christian camp lmao", "But then he wouldn't be so scared of his son getting someone pregnant", "Intimacy that early especially with two sisters involved can be very damaging even if it's not noticed till later, that's because males, and females of any age can definitely be platonic friends but I don't know if you've ever seen American pie, but that's real and teenage boys think about it all the time even if they don't act on it, so why no be a parent and remove temptation", "Wow I see. I thought it varied from person to person. Thanks for telling me:)", "It does but unless there's some special circumstance boys around that age are either not interested in girls yet, or kinda perverted there's barely any in between", "Maybe the reason he is all about their friends is he can't even try to have a conversation with you without you steamrollering him and anything he has go say as not being right becuase your the parent. \n\nYour actively dismissing him and teaching him not to communicate becuase it makes no difference right as he is about to hit puberty and is going to need to communicate most with you. Your actively telling him you think his opinions and feelings are worthless and not worth listening to and he is not going to feel safe to talk about his issues (that he is for sure going to have) with you. \n\nYour parenting by demand and that never turns out well for anyone involved. Either they close down and never tell you anything and rarely visit the moment they are free or they run around trying to get all the experiences and learn all the 'whys' you never explained. It may even get to the point where he does everything you told him no to just to rebel against your control.", "As a lesbian, I can tell you gender separated spaces certainly don't stop people from having sex too young. Better to be the kind of person your kid can talk to about it.", "None of the children mentioned are 13.\n\nAlso, yes.", "Thanks for explaining:)) like I said, the reason I asked is genuinely because I thought it depends on the persons will power, just like it does for girls. In my teens there were girls who\u2019s hormones were going crazy and they could say/do the most perverted things, others knew how to control themselves and didn\u2019t really \u201cexperiment\u201d until the age of 15-16 \u2026. That\u2019s how it was for me and my friends, but everyone\u2019s different, you never know. You\u2019re probably right, the majority is like that, it\u2019s difficult to control hormones, and inappropriate thoughts, but I still think behavior and actions can be controlled, even in this case\u2026. It would be difficult tho if both parties acted on it\u2026 so I get what you\u2019re saying :)", "Can you please explain your last sentence?  It looks like English, but I cannot parse it at all.  (Maybe I'm just getting old.)", "I mean it does and I completely understand where your coming from, but I really just think he's trying to teach his son you have to behave differently in different situations, it's kinda like we have to have the police talk with our kids at a much younger age and other people don't"]}
