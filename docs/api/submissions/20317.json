My father is obsessed with needing to know what I do for a living. I began a job a few years ago and have signed multiple forms indicating it is 100% confidential. It's a great job, and much better than the long time I worked in restaurant. I have told my father as much as I am legally allowed to tell him, but it is not okay with him. He wants specifics of what I do, which I can't legally give. He believes because he is family, it should be okay for him to know. That said, I already can't trust him not to go around putting any details on display. For context, when my brother and sister-in-law had their first baby, they told him not to announce the news until they did. He announced it immediately, and they were furious. When they had their second baby, he did the same thing.Well, back to my story.

I would have breaks in between projects, and so I wanted to check out a board game convention. It was in the same city, but a fairly long drive, so I figured I'd just use my hotel points to stay the hotel where the convention was being held. When I returned, I found out he had been keeping tabs on me, as he asked me how \"hotel xyz\" was, and I hadn't told him where I was staying or the name of the convention, but what upset me was that it seemed like he didn't trust I was telling the truth about where I was going. Even if it was a secret, it's none of his business. He started opening my mail, specifically mail from my employer. All he's seen is my tax information. Thankfully, it wasn't long before I could move out, which of course, infuriated him. Some of my mail still goes to his house, since I had been staying there previously, and he continues to open it, but luckily, nothing that could cost me my job.  \n\n\nAITA for not just telling my father the details of my job?", "created_utc": 1687445731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g5pdr/aita_for_not_telling_my_father_what_i_do_for_a/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You aren't supposed to divulge that info, he certainly doesn't need that info. Let him get over it.", "Duh, NTA.  If you legally can't, you would be worse than an asshole for doing so.

Your dad is being ridiculously nosy.", "NTA. \n\nIf you have the emotional energy, you could ask your dad what makes him want to know? \n\nMaybe he\u2019s worried about you. Maybe he fears the NDA  is a cover for something illegal or (to him) unethical. Perhaps you can reassure him. \n\nOr, perhaps he\u2019s just nosy as fuck, lacks discretion, and gets an ego boost from knowing and sharing things like an insider. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d hold the boundary at \u201cNo\u201d. But everyone has different dynamics and baggage with family.", "NTA . First of all, he has no right to open your private stuff, and only you get to decide what to tell him about your life in general. And about your work in particular, you signed a confidenciality agreement, so you get in trouble if you talk about confidential stuff, even if it is to  a family member. \n\nYour father doesn't respect your privacy so he is TAH for that.", "NTA especially since you're legally obligated not to reveal anything.\n\nIf I were you, I would tell him I work for NASA, CIA, MI6, Mussad, KGB...", "NTA\n\nI would be PISSED.  Next time it comes up, just blow up and tell him you work for the CIA.", "NTA. He sounds awful.

Also, make sure you have changed your address with your employer. \n\nPerhaps he should take up a hobby and leave you alone.", "Obviously not. He's not entitled to the details of your life to satisfy his curiosity. He's not trustworthy. He shouldn't be asking you to break confidences.

He\u2019s also an AH for the baby announcement stuff but i dont really see how thats related. \n\nOtherwise, how would he have know what hotel you were staying at? Why cant he know also? \n\nAsking about your adult kids job is pretty standard parent/child conversation\u2026 so you maybe hes invasive and overbearing and thats now made you paranoid.", "YTA. For lying. Before I get downvoted think on this, I quite frankly don\u2019t believe that you can\u2019t even disclose what field you\u2019re working in. I\u2019ve signed a lot of non disclosure agreements for work but you can still say what company and field you work for. That\u2019s not even legal.

There is no way op isn\u2019t allowed to say what they to for work. That\u2019s far outside the scope of an nda. They\u2019ve either signed something unenforceable from a shady company or they\u2019re fibbing a bit. I sign a lot of ndas at my job.", "lol nah there's no tracking device. I'm pretty sure he just googled about board game convention or something and just connected the dots.", "I have told him no so many times, and finally moved out, however I can't prevent him from opening my mail if it still winds up at his house.

He would def cost op their job and/or expose them to legal liability. Nta for keeping dad in the dark.", "the baby thing was just to explain why I can't trust him to keep it to himself if I did tell him. The hotel thing, he had googled something about board game conventions in the city, and where it was located and such. It doesn't matter that he knew.

I can tell him the general field, but what he is looking for is specific details of day to day activities, which I can't do.", "I mean, if I had a dad like OP's I wouldn't give him the barest shred of info about it because he'd use it to find the rest.", "Yes! Lol I can\u2019t believe so many people are buying this story. What op is saying is far outside the scope of an nda.", "Ahhh good point. Thank you. I didnt connect those dots", "Bullshit my friend. Read my edit, I\u2019ve done contracts for the American military in prototypes and I\u2019m not under these restraints. I could even spell it out here if some weirdo wouldn\u2019t find me irl. It\u2019s much more about document control etc.", "I don't even want to argue. I know what my NDA says. I'm sorry you had a different experience. Besides that fact, even if I could tell him the name of my company, none of that changes the dynamic of this story even a little.", "That\u2019s even legal my guy. If they\u2019ve made you sign something saying that\u2019s there\u2019s no way it\u2019s legally enforceable. Ndas are about the theft of intellectual property. They can\u2019t control you to this level."]}
