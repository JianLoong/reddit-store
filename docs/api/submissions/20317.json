My father is obsessed with needing to know what I do for a living. I began a job a few years ago and have signed multiple forms indicating it is 100% confidential.

He wants specifics of what I do, which I can't legally give. He believes because he is family, it should be okay for him to know. That said, I already can't trust him not to go around putting any details on display. For context, when my brother and sister-in-law had their first baby, they told him not to announce the news until they did. He announced it immediately, and they were furious.

I would have breaks in between projects, and so I wanted to check out a board game convention. It was in the same city, but a fairly long drive, so I figured I'd just use my hotel points to stay the hotel where the convention was being held. When I returned, I found out he had been keeping tabs on me, as he asked me how \"hotel xyz\" was, and I hadn't told him where I was staying or the name of the convention, but what upset me was that it seemed like he didn't trust I was telling the truth about where I was going. Even if it was a secret, it's none of his business. He started opening my mail, specifically mail from my employer. All he's seen is my tax information. Thankfully, it wasn't long before I could move out, which of course, infuriated him. Some of my mail still goes to his house, since I had been staying there previously, and he continues to open it, but luckily, nothing that could cost me my job.  \n\n\nAITA for not just telling my father the details of my job?", "created_utc": 1687445731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14g5pdr/aita_for_not_telling_my_father_what_i_do_for_a/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
