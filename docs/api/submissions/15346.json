By the time I got home, it was about 10pm. I waited for my luggage and tried to call an Uber but couldn\u2019t connect to a driver. I live in a really big city so Ubers are usually pretty easy to get. \n\nAnnoyed, I walked back into the airport and called a taxi, gave him my address and kind of zoned out on my phone. The driver was a much older and bigger guy than me and wouldn\u2019t stop talking so I was doing my best to just not pay attention. I was tired, grumpy, and anxious to get home. \n\nAround the time I should\u2019ve been getting to my side of town I look from my phone and I had no idea where we were. So I ask him \u201cwhere are we?\u201d \n\nAnd he names a random street. And I\u2019m thinking wtf? That\u2019s past my house\u2026. \n\nAt this point i was trying really hard to figure out where we were and how we got there but it was pretty dark out. I asked him to get off the freeway and he wouldnt. So I firmly asked again while calling my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI recognized some streets and realize he\u2019s driven about 10 minutes past my exit, into a shadier part of town. I asked him to follow by direction and at this point I\u2019m yelling at him because he refuses to listen and just keeps trying to show me his gps which is telling him to turn around but he didn\u2019t believe me. He just kept asking \u201cwhat happened to you?\u201d Which caused me more frustration. Panicked, I scream at him to pull over, telling him multiple times that I want to get out of the car. \n\nHe finally pulled over in a not so safe area and I jumped out of the car and ran to the back to grab my luggage before he could take off and the last thing he said was, \u201cso you\u2019re not going to pay?\u201d \n\nI screamed \u201cno. You took me to the wrong place and wouldn\u2019t let me out the car!\u201d And then ran into the gas station visibly shaking and upset. My fianc\u00e9 came and got me since he had started tracking my Phone to come find me. \n\nSo, AITH for refusing to pay this taxi driver who had already driven me long enough for about a $50 fare? (the actual fare was higher but there\u2019s no way I was paying for him driving past my house and then having to go back).", "created_utc": 1682079529, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12tzx13/aita_31f_for_screaming_at_my_taxi_driver_and/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds horrifying. If you have any info about him at all I think he needs to be reported.", "NTA.  Fuck that guy.  \n\nI remember way back in the day I paid a cab driver to take me from a well known hotel to the giant international Airport.  \n\nHe magically took me down every random side street where there were construction and street closures and then would act shocked and surprised.  It was obviously a ploy to keep the meter running.  I wish he would have just come out and told me he wanted $100 to take me to the airport instead of yanking my chain since I was running late for my flight. \n\nPoint being.  Some taxi drivers are shady like that.  AT BEST that's what he was trying to do, which is an AH move.  I shudder to think of what plan you may have thwarted after he found out your fiance was tracking your phone. \n\nI'd not only say fuck that guy but I almost think you should report him.", "NTA-sounds pretty shady on the driver's part", "NTA. I'm so sorry, that sounds terrifying. \n\nIf you have any information about this taxi, please report them to local authorities.", "NTA. From now on, snap a photo of the car (especially the license plate), and get another pic of the operating license (posted on the driver\u2019s back seat) when you\u2019re inside the vehicle. And always have someone on your phone chatting with you about your location. Make sure the driver hears you. Never give drivers your actual home address; rather, have them pick you up and drop you off at a nearby corner or business.\n\nI know these are ridiculous lengths to go to, but we women should be used to being hypersensitive of our surroundings at all times. Is if fair? Of course it\u2019s not. But it\u2019s a fact of life.", "Nta\n\nHe was ignoring his own gps trying to up charge you, and that's the best case scenario. Report him to the taxi company.", "I drive taxi. You did the right thing. Sketchy assholes like him are the reason taxi drivers get a bad name. NTA. Call the company, they keep track of every trip. At least where I am from, they do. It's actually the law here.", "I don\u2019t like UBER the company for how they treat the drivers, but it was better as a ride than taxis. Much safer for the driver and rider, none of this circling around pretending to get lost to drive up the fare. Saying, \u201ccash only\u201d to make you drive to an atm. Cleaner.", "NTA\nThis sounds creepy. I hope you are able to recognize and report that guy.", "NTA even if you weren't terrified. Dude was taking advantage of you, running up the fare.", "NTA. \nWhy didn\u2019t your fianc\u00e9 just pick you up to begin with?", "NTA. He\u2019s the reason people would rather use Uber than a taxi driver. He was taking the longest route possible to run up the meter.", "NTA that must have been a terrifying experience. So glad you got home safe and good on you for not paying him. People have bills to pay, of course, but the way he blatantly ignored your directions suggests that he shouldn\u2019t be working as a taxi driver. I hope he finds another job because it sounds like he has the potential to traumatise his customers.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I use car services, Uber, or Lyft now. NTA.", "NTA. You are not wrong for prioritizing your safety in the least. If he was genuine he would have done what he could to reassure you and make it right, he didn\u2019t and that\u2019s a red flag.

And for a split second it crossed my mind that I needed this info but I was so panicked by the time I actually had my things, combined with concern for the area we were in, I just wanted to get inside the gas station.", "Agreed. I had an Uber driver do this in Tampa. They got off the wrong exit and the first red light we were  sitting 10 feet from an active murder with the body still there. \n\nThat wrong exit literally doubled the mileage and fare. Also turned a 10 minute ride into an almost 30 minute one.\n\n__PSA:__ always map your destination before even getting in a taxi/Uber/Lyft.", "Agreed.  Also, @caffinatedkitti on TikTok has made some excellent fake FaceTime call videos to use in situations like this", "Right? And with Uber, you can share your ride location with someone. I\u2019ve even had Uber send me alerts asking me if I was ok because they noticed the driver was driving the wrong way for an extended period of time. He was going the wrong way to get around road closures so it wasn\u2019t a big deal then. \n\nI\u2019ll def stick with Ubers for a while", "Uber isn\u2019t safer at all, it has HORRIBLE statistics for rape and harassment by its drivers \nhttps://helpingsurvivors.org/uber-lyft-sexual-violence-stats/", "Uber isn't safe bud.

I had my phone\u2019s gps on because I had looked up how far my destination was, and I hadn\u2019t bothered to shut it off. I finally told the driver I could see he was going in the wrong direction and to correct it immediately or I was calling 911. He did, but it was scary and I did not pay him when we arrived.\n\nUnrelated to the issue- I was heading to a small, niche gym, from the business location I had worked at for the day. I had already contacted the gym owner about dropping in for a workout and when I told him what happened he insisted on driving me back to my hotel afterwards. I saw the owner a few years later at a competition in another state and we still remembered each other. Good people are nice.", "I had the same situation in a taxi and it\u2019s not comfortable. In Boston, the taxis usually don\u2019t have door locks in the back and the driver locks you in. It\u2019s scary.  UBER used to be all over but they cut the drivers share of the fare that over 40% of the Uber drivers quit since December.

I thought I\u2019d ask \ud83d\ude06 \nWe have 3 kids and my husband would never* let me Uber alone especially at night, so we just pack up the kids and bring them.", "This, they should be able to find out who it is if you give them a physical description along with the time and location he picked you up.\n\nPlease do report him, it\u2019s sadly all too common for Uber and taxi drivers to SA single women, and the fact that he was driving you to a shady part of the city and refusing to let you out tells me that exactly what he planned to do.\n\nBut good on you for listening to your instincts and putting up a big enough fuss to convince him you wouldn\u2019t be an easy victim, along with calling your bf.  You saved yourself, and you are awesome!", "He picks me up whenever he can but I travel so often for work that it would be unfair to the little one to do that to her. If it was a one off thing, he\u2019d absolutely just bring her. Which is what he ended up doing last night when everything turned weird.", "I totally get that! That must be exhausting traveling so often! Booooo! \n\nI\u2019m glad you got home safely though!", "NTA.  Always be aware of your surroundings though.", "NTA\n\nPlease ask the information from the air port, sometimes they have the security footage or something an report him. In the best case it was scamming in the worst case he tried to kidnap you.", "NTA  I would have been terrified too.", "Deffo NTA. Id be terrified and react probably the same way. GJ on getting somewhere safe.", "Are you comparing Uber to local taxi companies or just throwing out Uber statistic without comparison? If you get into a taxi, do you have a record of what taxi you got into, like Uber? Does the taxi driver know who the who\u2019s getting in there cab? No. There\u2019s often no record. Uber is likely much safer than what existed before, it just gets headlines and is much larger.", "Hey bud- what makes you think taxis were safer? That the drivers didn\u2019t assault people? Because they weren\u2019t caught? \n\nThere\u2019s not a record of who got into what taxi and most were cash only. \n\nYou lack perspective and understanding because you don\u2019t remember what it was like before Uber. Uber isn\u2019t great, but the drivers and and riders are much safer than taxis.\n\nTinder, Grindr, and other dating apps are also used in sexual assaults and likely far more often. You don\u2019t need a background check to use them. Again, you\u2019re holding Uber to a higher standard that didn\u2019t exist. They are shitty to their drivers but are a better than what they replaced."]}
