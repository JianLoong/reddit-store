Is she 5 yrs old? Is she an anti Semite? Or does she simply want to humiliate you? I think all of the above. \nYour mother does not need a key nor access to your home in order to be your mom. I dont see why she is complaining so much about losing the key. She doesn't need a key. The only thing it changes is her violating you. Is that her only connection to you?
