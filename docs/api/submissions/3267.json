Immediate NTA.", "Nta", "Nta. I remember working in a restaurant and we were told NOT to give customers any OTC pain pills or allergy pills because someone had sued a restaurant when their server had given them aspirin when they said they had a headache and the customer had an allergic reaction. Unfortunately people are very litigious these days.", "Nope \ud83d\udc4e\ud83c\udffb this person seems VERY entitled. Just report them to HR.", "NTA, and for the record that is absolutely NOT the worst case scenario with taking a pill. What on earth? I can\u2019t imagine having the stones to ask a random coworker to have some of their prescription meds.", "Your colleague sounds like an addict. NTA and never give people pills like you're a pharmacist. Worst case scenario they get sick and then sue you.", "NTA. They're for you and you need them. Also, what if colleague got hurt (e.g., using heavy machinery) because of the drug effect they weren't used to. Not worth the risk.", "Agree - I take strong codeine pills - I would NEVER give one to a colleague. They are a controlled drug", "I actually will share my albuterol asthma inhaler as long as it is the same drug they normally use for their asthma. With proper form it is no lip contact   And I figure it\u2019s a safer medicine to share.\n\nBecause sometimes you forget your inhaler and have an attack", "And asking for one only after seeing the bottle? If she having a headache or stomach pains or something she would ask around before. Pain pills aren't candy that you see someone eating and suddenly crave.", "Yeah, if you\u2019ve ever seen any of the Live Captions when people get pulled over and they find OXY in a baggie and they don\u2019t have a bottle with a prescription with their name on it it\u2019s trouble, so yeah if we\u2019re talking about that level of pain pills it\u2019s definitely illegal for someone to have it does not have it prescribed to them it prescribed to them", "Morphine?! I was getting a daily shot of that stuff while recovering from a surgery. It would knock me out completely for the rest of the day. Why would anyone want to take it voluntarily is beyond me. I've even started refusing it after the first few days and just tolerated pain as long as I could to reduce the amount they give me.", "This is why pharmacists & GPs try to monitor all a patient\u2019s medications: to look for drug interactions or side effects of conditions", "I added that due to a lot of people at the beginning saying it's out right illegal, someone even specified US, i am not from or in the US, and after a quick search and ask around, it is very much not illegal in my country with exceptions. \n\nMy pills are not in the exception.", "I'm 20, my colleague is in like her 40's ish? Legit, unsure how old she is. But don't think she's above 50.", "NTA. They\u2019re your pills, and they\u2019re a prescription.", "\nRemember you have a working camera.", "NTA  Right? And I would never think of asking for a prescribed pain pill from a person that obviously needs need. I've had two surgeries and the pain pills certainly ran out before the pain.", "This was my thought too -- OP better keep those pills under lock and key.", "Stolen from u/SkysEevee", "I'd suggest keeping them with you so your co-worker doesn't try to take them.", "You can get some over the counter meds on prescription in the UK (btw if that happens it's vetter to buy them from Boots own brand as so much cheaper than prescription medication) but I think OP is talking about medication that can only be obtained on prescription.", "Here in the U.S. you could get a prescription for otc meds as well because sometimes your insurance or fsa card may cover it of prescribed. Ive also heard of drs giving troublesome patients a prescription for otc meds when they insist they need something stronger than what they can get otc insist on a prescription and let them figure out at the pharmacy that\u2019s it\u2019s just plain old Tylenol or Motrin.", "So do I, but the person I replied to said:\n\n>Just a heads up, I don\u2019t know any country where prescriptions drugs are legal, meaning if they ARENT prescribed to you, it\u2019s illegal to have them. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be prescription drugs, and you\u2019d get them at a drug store like you would Tylenol or cough syrup.\n\nAnd I was just commenting that you *can* in fact get OTC meds prescribed. And that it's not illegal to have those OTC things without a prescription"]}
