These are not off the shelf/over the counter pain relievers. These are prescription medications issued by a medical professional to you and you only. To share these medicines is wildly irresponsible and possibly downright illegal.\n\nAsking doesn't make your colleague TA, it's once you explained they were prescription the continual pushing that makes her TA. Also, worst case it won't do anything? No, worst case it *makes her extremely sick or kills her*. Her logic is faulty and she is an entitled AH.", "NTA. They were prescribed for *you*, not your coworker. If your coworker wants prescription drugs she can go to the doctor herself and ask. As someone with chronic pain not on any pain meds myself, I would never ask another person for theirs. Your coworker just has a boundary problem, so don\u2019t feel bad about this.", "NTA im pretty sure there's laws that says you're not allowed to share prescription medication with other people especially at the workplace", "NTA worse case scenario is that they\u2019ll have to go to the hospital", "NTA.\n\n1. Your stuff, no law reason you have to share\n2. It\u2019s illegal in a lot of states\n3. Your medical concerns are valid. Drugs can interact, among other medical concerns (height, weight, liver and kidney function, etc)\n4. Asking for meds is weird drug seeking behavior\n5. If she really needs pain meds she can ask her doctor", "NTA and tbh I would consider reporting this to hr. It\u2019s grossly inappropriate and illegal", "Nope. Nta.\n\n>These are prescribed to me. I have Tylenol or Motrin if you would like one of those.", "NTA. People shouldn't share prescription medication - there's a reason it needs to be prescribed. Over the counter ones - fine.", "It's illegal actually so you did the smart thing.", "NTA.  This drives me crazy, it is an rx.", "NTA. There\u2019s a reason it\u2019s illegal to sell prescription drugs. And you\u2019re right; you don\u2019t know about her allergies or what it could do to her. She can take something OTC, like ibuprofen. It\u2019s pretty crazy that she would get mad over that.", "NTA It's actually illegal in the US to give someone Rx meds without them having a Rx, potentially a felony.\n\n I would be surprised if this weren't the case in your country. What would be the point of requiring a prescription to get the meds then? Everything would just be sold over the counter. \n\nI would do a bit of Google research if I were you.", "NTA! You absolutely did the right thing by not sharing your prescription medication. Do not second guess yourself and do not give in. Not only is it illegal, imagine if you two had a falling out someday and she went to the boss saying you were handing out prescription pain pills at work??", "NTA\n\nWhat if you need that pain pill later and don't have it?  You spent the money on the doctor's visit and the prescription, let her pay out for the same.", "NTA. How strange to ask someone to share their prescription medication.", "NTA", "No, NTA\nalso, were you the only coworker in the building?\nIf not, her reaction is a major \ud83d\udea9", "It's a small box, she saw that I still had some, but as far as I know, the name wasn't visible.", "No, but the only one in the changing room. I was just getting the pill from my locker to take it when she came in and asked if I had one.", "NTA. People don\u2019t just randomly ask for pain pills. Obviously there are exceptions but usually people who do this have a problem or are beginning to have a problem. Not to mention if she has a problem\u2026 She\u2019s not going to just ask you once.", "Oh well. Good to know you keep them in a locker, I was going to suggest you need to start locking them up.", "you fancy being liable for allergies, anaphylaxis, death or disability resulting from giving her your stuff.\nlike insurance,  all is fine until shit happens\n\nNTA", "We each have our own locker, but there have been cases where the locks have been broken and things stolen."]}
