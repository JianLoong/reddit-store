He\u2019s in his late 50s and super strict, especially with the girls for some reason. He also has a special hatred for students who cut class, and after some kids in my hour pulled a stunt earlier this year (they asked to go to the bathroom and didn\u2019t come back to class), he\u2019s had a policy that student can\u2019t take their bags to the bathroom. His rationale is that, if students have to leave their bags behind, they\u2019ll have to come back for them. \n\nAs you can imagine, this rule has been so frustrating for the girls in the class. As you guys probably know, most women\u2019s clothing doesn\u2019t have pockets large enough to fit a pad or tampon discreetly. I\u2019ve just dealt with it by wearing bulky hoodies and putting my pads in the front pocket, but it\u2019s been really hot lately and our school has really bad quality AC, so on Thursday I didn\u2019t wear one. \n\nAnyway, about halfway through Mr, Miller\u2019s class I raised my hand and asked to go to the bathroom. He said yes, and I stood up with my bag hoping that he wouldn\u2019t notice. He noticed. He \u2018reminded\u2019 me, in that condescending way that older teachers talk down to teens, that I had to leave my bag in the classroom. (Idk how the exact convo went, but the following is the gist)\n\nMe: \u201cSorry, I need it.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller: \u201cI don\u2019t care, I make the rules in this classroom. Please go to the bathroom without your backpack or sit down.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cC\u2019mon please, I need my bag.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller: \u201cAlright I\u2019ll bite. Why in the world could you possibly need your backpack?\u201d\n\nMe (now extremely frustrated and needing to pee really bad, shouting): \u201c**Because I need a pad to soak up the blood that comes out of my vagina,** ***STEVE***\u201d \n\nI then stormed out, bag slung over my shoulder. When I got out of the bathroom, I was intercepted in the hallway by a guidance counselor and taken to the office. They called my parents and issued me a full week of  after school detention for \u201cuse of graphic and vulgar language and unauthorized walkout.\u201d (My mom negotiated it down to two sessions because I\u2019m generally a very good student and it was my first offense of this nature) \n\nI talked to my sister about it, and she said that I shouldn\u2019t have made a scene, that it *is* his classroom and I should follow his rules. She also told me that I shouldn\u2019t have disrupted class like that, and that I was making a mountain out of a molehill. Her words have me second guessing my actions, so now I\u2019m wondering, AITA?\n\nETA: more info\n\n- Mr Miller\u2019s policy applies to all bags, including pencil cases and small purses. \n\n- I would normally never say what I said, as I am usually very private about my period and menstrual products, I was really frustrated and needed to use the bathroom really badly.", "created_utc": 1684119386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hvjmj/aita_for_using_graphic_and_vulgar_language_when/", "score": 5393, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My friend and I got dragged to the office and then after I protested I still needed a tampon they allowed me go to the heath office where I had to pay for one by putting coins in a dispenser that was on the wall next to a window. \n\nI was humiliated. \n\nThis shit should not still be happening in 2023.", "Graphic, yes.

Yeah, I'd be snapping too).  \n\n\nIn the future, if something like this happens again, try shifting the embarrassment onto the other person. Like instead of yelling, when asked \"what do you need it for?\" calmly open your bag, pull out a pad, dramatically hold it out towards him and politely say your bit. Keeps you from getting punished and makes them less entitled to ask about your business. The more you gross them out while maintaining \"politeness,\" the more effective.", "NTA - in the 70s I read the handbook they gave to substitute teachers. It clearly said if a female student asked to use the restroom you were to let her go, because . . . obvious answer. That would have included taking necessary items with you. Steve doesn't seem to have read the handbook. \n\nAnd it would have been a good idea to talk to a female guidance counselor at the school to solve the problem - either they tell Steve to let girls take their purse with them, restrooms are stocked with emergency items or vending machines, or the counselor has items in her office that you can take without being obvious.

You should be able to go to the bathroom without having to ask permission.", "Absolutely NTA.

Made uncomfortable eye contact with him while I fished out my tampon. Held it straight in the air \"all good , sir\".

If this teacher can\u2019t catch why a woman might need to bring their bag to the bathroom, they need to take a class with the health teacher. You used graphic (or detailed) language, but not vulgar. You should not have been punished, your teacher should have for violating your right to privacy.\n\nYou are also 17 years old, if he cannot treat you like an adult then I don\u2019t believe he deserves the same.", "NTA. Teacher should not be allowed to continue with that policy; he should never have been permitted to institute it at all, and your disciplinary hearing should have been his disciplinary hearing.", "NTA.  He asked a question he should have known the answer to. You answered honestly.  \n\nI had male teachers (and it was always male teachers) who pulled that shit.  We had a no bookbags for bathroom passes rule, but girls were allowed to have purses for obvious reasons.   Well there were male teachers that decided that purses were not permitted on bathroom passes and seemed to love trying to embarrass girls and make them squirm  and would try to stop us. I just did not give a shit about their crap and refused to be embarrassed.  So I would respond with informing them that part of puberty for women is menstruation and we had no control over when it happened,  but we did need to absorb the flow, they could reach out to the health teacher if they had any questions but I really needed to do something before I bled in the classroom.   Not all the girls felt comfortable with turning the crap back on the teachers but one girl had a relative who worked for the ACLU and had them help her write up a petition to better educate the teachers on the needs of adolescent girls.  Complete with the implication that continued denial of accommodations for needs could result in a lawsuit.  \n\nBefore anyone claims it wasn't fair the girls got to carry purses on bathroom passes, any student who needed special items during bathroom use was allowed to carry a small bag to the bathroom.  These male teachers just never bothered asked the boys why they needed to take a bag to the bathroom.", "Nta\n\nIf a man in his 50's is scared of the word vagina than he's a sheltered fool. How the hell can someone that old forget girls get periods.\n\nTheyre just punishing you for not taking his shit", "NTA, i would have hoped he felt humiliated and i hope the class laughed their ass off at him after you left.", "NTA.

However a better way would have been to report him to administrators when he made the rule.  Or, walk out with your bag despite his objection , use the restroom and then go straight to administration to complain about him.  I hate those woman hating high school teachers who harass teen girls about their periods in the name of discipline.  I had a teacher like that.  Due to a medical condition I went to the nurse\u2019s off when i needed to use the restroom, and she would give me a note  with \u201cuse facilities\u201d checked to excuse my tardiness to my next class.  Mr Ochi called me out in front of the class, loudly asking \u201cuse facilities?\u201d  I looked him in the eye and replied \u201cthat\u2019s what the note says\u201d.

She yelled at the old man teacher that she needed her bag because there was blood coming out of her vagina and she needed to take care of that or he could clean her chair. \n\nThe restrictions on bathrooms and their usage needs to be more tolerant for teen girls. You can TELL when a girl has an issue they need to take care of by the look on their face when you question them.", "NTA and since you used anatomically correct terms you shouldn't be penalized at all. The teacher should though and I'd be filing a report with the school district offices.

No teacher has the right to restrict a students access to toilets or prevent her from discretely carrying period products.\n\nI remember being in Grade 10 science class.  A friend was sitting on a stool in front of me.  When she stood she had had a leak.\n\nI walked up to the teacher, told him I was taking Sue out of the room.  Then I walked up to her, told her to leave the room and walked directly behind her, so no one saw the stain.\n\nOnce we were out of the classroom I explained why I got her out of there.  My kicker was closest, we grabbed a hoodie to wrap around her waist, then went to the girls change room where there were period supplies and she could change into gym strip.", "Man fuck Mr. Millers old bald headed ass. You tell him I said he's a monk.", "Neutral-TA.\n\nMale teacher here.  In 2023, if a male teacher doesn't understand why a 5th-12th grade female student might need to take their bag to the bathroom, they need to retake 6th grade health themselves.  His conduct was unforgivably ignorant.\n\nThat being said, if you used a different tone and stormed out, I think there'd have been little to no blow back.  Yelling at the teacher in front of the class and fracturing any sort of classroom management is probably why he took it to the next level.  A teacher losing respect of the class is the worst case scenario.\n\nBut other than that I am very empathetic to your situation.", "NTA you didn't handle it well but he was being unreasonable. The school needs to have a policy that allows female students to manage their periods. This should be taken further.\n\n Has the school suggested what you should have said/done instead? Having to announce you are on your period in front of the class strikes me as inappropriate (regardless of how explicit you are about it).", "ESH\n\nYour teacher absolutely needs to be understanding of feminine needs. But something about the way you wrote the post makes me think you're skewing what actually happened. \"He also has a special hatred for students who cut class.\" Well, duh? Is that so unreasonable?", "NTA, goddamn, what year is it?", "NTA. I think you need to go speak with the principal or rally some other students on this one. Your male teacher is denying you the right to take your personal items to the restroom. If you cut class and don\u2019t return, he can punish you then. But not before. \nHis \u201crule\u201d puts every person with a medically-needed item in a situation where they have to ignore the need or risk punishment or humiliation. And when you stood up for your need to take a personal item with you, he had you punished anyway. \nThe reality is that you could have quietly grabbed a pad from your bag, in full view of others, and left for the restroom, maybe slightly embarrassed. But I kinda love you for going nuclear. Please ask your mom to write you a note that you have a medical necessity to take personal items to the restroom. And then get as many other students to get the same note from their parents so that his rule is trashed.", "that's funny af you're literally just describing what a period is to him.... if that's vulgar then obviously he's sensitive. you didn't scream slurs or curse him out, just used his first name and told him you were on your period in detail. nta he needs to cope he's a grown ass man", "He asked you... so def nta", "This is the second time I have seen this story.", "NTA  but, using the teacher\u2019s first name probably crossed the line", "NTA, good on you for not being bullied by your teacher and you probably helped other females in his class who are too timid to pipe up and say anything.", "NTA.

WHY DO BABIES HAVE MORE POCKETS AND POCKET SPACE THAN ME?! ah, right selling purses lol!\n\nif your principal or anyone at the school gives you trouble or even before that ask for the contact information for the director of the school district or just ask for as many contacts you can in your district, heck even other districts. if anything negative happens, keep records of anything you are able too and email everyone you can. you complain and be a thorn in their side because they will ignore it or handle it in the crap way. I don't like being a problem, but in a situation like this it is needed and if anything happens to you, fight it. they will always protect themselves and their assets before students (depending on the school the treatment will matter on if you have money or if you are an athlete) or anyone that can take money away from them.\n\n\n(*) This is only my experience in British Columbia. Canada, I cannot talk about experiences/rules/regulations really out of the Okanagan/ Vancouver/ Victoria area lol it doesn't change too much but from my understanding from a sister who is a teacher is that unless you will be specializing or mainly teaching those classes you literally don't have to know anything. My biology teacher was barely able to teach us because of her devoted love to Christianity and because sex before marriage( even non consenual anything) was a major hell earning sin.  \n\nagain you are NTA, F**k Steve and if you get into any trouble F**ck the school too and if your parents agree mention a lawyer or going to the media is helping you and that can help you/ protect you", "Or stronger men.

I had complained about having to go pick them up or bring different clothes them enough that it's even listed in their school demographic that if they ask to go don't stop them. \n\nThe doctors my daughters see are amazing. The family Dr sent the first note until the could get in with the gynecologist. Then she sent a second note.

It may well be true, but it's not relevant and makes me question your interpretation of everything else. This rule he had was applied to everyone and wasn't aimed at a specific gender of person, from what you have outlined.\n\nSecondly - yes that was graphic. Not vulgar, but needlessly graphic. You wouldn't have described any other bathroom relevant bodily function so openly in class in the same terms I assume - so why is this different? I suspect the answer is because there is a stigma around girls talking about this which you're riding on the back of here - a stigma that fully should be addressed I might add. But not like this. People aren't challenging that stigma so you can say what you have in a classroom full of people - I wouldn't dream of making a similar comment about a bowel movement, an equally natural function, so why is this different? It's not.\n\nAnd finally, you knew about this rule. You even prepared for it previously so that it didn't create problems for you.

This is a normal part of your body, no one can shame you for it and if they try, just look them straight in the eye and tell them, this is how the female body works, I can't change that and you making fun of me is not gonna change it either so get lost! \n\nThere are two ways you could have handled this better but again, you're a teen, everyone doesn't usually make the absolute best, most mature decisions as teenagers:\n\n1- Ask the teacher if you can speak to him outside the classroom to explain (most people would be able to infer but at least, you don't have to say it out loud).\n\n2- (And this is my preferred method), drop the bag, take out your pad/tampon and just walk out the door with it in your hand. And if someone brings it up to you after, again, look them straight in the eye and say \"I'm female, I have periods, get over it\". What this does is show people you're not embarrassed by this normal bodily function, it makes you look confident and it normalizes the whole thing to most people. If a bully can't make fun of you, there is no fun in the act. \n\nYou made a big deal out of it, you snapped at a teacher (a dumbass teacher but a teacher nonetheless).
