He\u2019s in his late 50s and super strict, especially with the girls for some reason. He also has a special hatred for students who cut class, and after some kids in my hour pulled a stunt earlier this year (they asked to go to the bathroom and didn\u2019t come back to class), he\u2019s had a policy that student can\u2019t take their bags to the bathroom. His rationale is that, if students have to leave their bags behind, they\u2019ll have to come back for them. \n\nAs you can imagine, this rule has been so frustrating for the girls in the class. As you guys probably know, most women\u2019s clothing doesn\u2019t have pockets large enough to fit a pad or tampon discreetly. I\u2019ve just dealt with it by wearing bulky hoodies and putting my pads in the front pocket, but it\u2019s been really hot lately and our school has really bad quality AC, so on Thursday I didn\u2019t wear one. \n\nAnyway, about halfway through Mr, Miller\u2019s class I raised my hand and asked to go to the bathroom. He said yes, and I stood up with my bag hoping that he wouldn\u2019t notice. He noticed. He \u2018reminded\u2019 me, in that condescending way that older teachers talk down to teens, that I had to leave my bag in the classroom. (Idk how the exact convo went, but the following is the gist)\n\nMe: \u201cSorry, I need it.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller: \u201cI don\u2019t care, I make the rules in this classroom. Please go to the bathroom without your backpack or sit down.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cC\u2019mon please, I need my bag.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller: \u201cAlright I\u2019ll bite. Why in the world could you possibly need your backpack?\u201d\n\nMe (now extremely frustrated and needing to pee really bad, shouting): \u201c**Because I need a pad to soak up the blood that comes out of my vagina,** ***STEVE***\u201d \n\nI then stormed out, bag slung over my shoulder. When I got out of the bathroom, I was intercepted in the hallway by a guidance counselor and taken to the office. They called my parents and issued me a full week of  after school detention for \u201cuse of graphic and vulgar language and unauthorized walkout.\u201d (My mom negotiated it down to two sessions because I\u2019m generally a very good student and it was my first offense of this nature) \n\nI talked to my sister about it, and she said that I shouldn\u2019t have made a scene, that it *is* his classroom and I should follow his rules. She also told me that I shouldn\u2019t have disrupted class like that, and that I was making a mountain out of a molehill. Her words have me second guessing my actions, so now I\u2019m wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684119386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hvjmj/aita_for_using_graphic_and_vulgar_language_when/", "score": 1388, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah, I'd be snapping too).  \n\n\nIn the future, if something like this happens again, try shifting the embarrassment onto the other person. Like instead of yelling, when asked \"what do you need it for?\" calmly open your bag, pull out a pad, dramatically hold it out towards him and politely say your bit.

We had a no bookbags for bathroom passes rule, but girls were allowed to have purses for obvious reasons.   Well there were male teachers that decided that purses were not permitted on bathroom passes and seemed to love trying to embarrass girls and make them squirm  and would try to stop us. I just did not give a shit about their crap and refused to be embarrassed.  So I would respond with informing them that part of puberty for women is menstruation and we had no control over when it happened,  but we did need to absorb the flow, they could reach out to the health teacher if they had any questions but I really needed to do something before I bled in the classroom.   Not all the girls felt comfortable with turning the crap back on the teachers but one girl had a relative who worked for the ACLU and had them help her write up a petition to better educate the teachers on the needs of adolescent girls.  Complete with the implication that continued denial of accommodations for needs could result in a lawsuit.  \n\nBefore anyone claims it wasn't fair the girls got to carry purses on bathroom passes, any student who needed special items during bathroom use was allowed to carry a small bag to the bathroom.  These male teachers just never bothered asked the boys why they needed to take a bag to the bathroom.", "Nta\n\nIf a man in his 50's is scared of the word vagina than he's a sheltered fool.

However a better way would have been to report him to administrators when he made the rule.  Or, walk out with your bag despite his objection , use the restroom and then go straight to administration to complain about him.  I hate those woman hating high school teachers who harass teen girls about their periods in the name of discipline.  I had a teacher like that.  Due to a medical condition I went to the nurse\u2019s off when i needed to use the restroom, and she would give me a note  with \u201cuse facilities\u201d checked to excuse my tardiness to my next class.  Mr Ochi called me out in front of the class, loudly asking \u201cuse facilities?\u201d  I looked him in the eye and replied \u201cthat\u2019s what the note says\u201d.

A friend was sitting on a stool in front of me.  When she stood she had had a leak.\n\nI walked up to the teacher, told him I was taking Sue out of the room.  Then I walked up to her, told her to leave the room and walked directly behind her, so no one saw the stain.\n\nOnce we were out of the classroom I explained why I got her out of there.

You tell him I said he's a monk.", "Neutral-TA.\n\nMale teacher here.  In 2023, if a male teacher doesn't understand why a 5th-12th grade female student might need to take their bag to the bathroom, they need to retake 6th grade health themselves.  His conduct was unforgivably ignorant.\n\nThat being said, if you used a different tone and stormed out, I think there'd have been little to no blow back.  Yelling at the teacher in front of the class and fracturing any sort of classroom management is probably why he took it to the next level.  A teacher losing respect of the class is the worst case scenario.\n\nBut other than that I am very empathetic to your situation.", "NTA you didn't handle it well but he was being unreasonable. The school needs to have a policy that allows female students to manage their periods. This should be taken further.\n\n Has the school suggested what you should have said/done instead? Having to announce you are on your period in front of the class strikes me as inappropriate (regardless of how explicit you are about it).", "ESH\n\nYour teacher absolutely needs to be understanding of feminine needs. But something about the way you wrote the post makes me think you're skewing what actually happened. \"He also has a special hatred for students who cut class.\" Well, duh? Is that so unreasonable?", "NTA, goddamn, what year is it?", "NTA. I think you need to go speak with the principal or rally some other students on this one. Your male teacher is denying you the right to take your personal items to the restroom. If you cut class and don\u2019t return, he can punish you then. But not before. \nHis \u201crule\u201d puts every person with a medically-needed item in a situation where they have to ignore the need or risk punishment or humiliation. And when you stood up for your need to take a personal item with you, he had you punished anyway. \nThe reality is that you could have quietly grabbed a pad from your bag, in full view of others, and left for the restroom, maybe slightly embarrassed. But I kinda love you for going nuclear. Please ask your mom to write you a note that you have a medical necessity to take personal items to the restroom. And then get as many other students to get the same note from their parents so that his rule is trashed.", "that's funny af you're literally just describing what a period is to him.... if that's vulgar then obviously he's sensitive. you didn't scream slurs or curse him out, just used his first name and told him you were on your period in detail. nta he needs to cope he's a grown ass man", "He asked you... so def nta", "This is the second time I have seen this story.", "NTA  but, using the teacher\u2019s first name probably crossed the line", "NTA, good on you for not being bullied by your teacher and you probably helped other females in his class who are too timid to pipe up and say anything.", "NTA.

Guy's a jerk not worthy of the respect he demands.", "Nah, I think your teacher is very unreasonable and frankly, if I was in the same situation, I might just say something similar. NTA", "NTA That\u2019s not vulgar language, that\u2019s basic biology\n\nBut you should go over his head and talk to parents/the principal about why taking your bag to the bathroom shouldn\u2019t be a problem.", "NTA, but could it been your tone of voice? did you raise your voice? The use of calling your teacher Steve are what possibly got you in trouble.", "You and the other girls can just bring a small pochette where to put tampons and other necessities and the problem would be solved without drama", "Teacher here. I\u2019m totally on your side and this would never have happened in my classroom. I would\u2019ve let you go to the bathroom with your bag.\n\nHowever, you could have just stated plainly that you were on your period. And not used the teacher\u2019s first name. That to me is the most problematic part of what you told your teacher.", "NTA. In what world is \"pad\", \"blood\" or \"vagina\" vulgar. They're just bits of our bodies and a thing you buy at the shop. I'd like Steve to explain why he thinks those things are vulgar and I expect the answer is misoginy.", "Take it to the school board. This is funking atrocious behaviour by everyone involved bar you tbh", "As a teacher I know better than this... sure he's a guy, but how do you go half a century and not realise women use sanitary items? NTA", "not really the AH although you could've just said that you are on you period instead of 'i need a pad to soak the blood outta mah vaginah STEEVE' but damn, if this is the way you, teens, talk to teachers, with 'C\u2019mon', and call them by their first name like they're your pals, it's pretty obvious they won't have respect for you either. if you show no respect for them, it's obviously going to go both ways.", "NTA, but girl, just carry the pad or tampon in your hand. It's clean and in its packaging; there's no reason it should be embarrassing. Signed, a 33-year-old lady.", "\"My teacher made it necessary to talk about what was happening with my vagina by literally asking a question to which my vagina was the answer. Can you please explain which term I should have used which would not have been vulgar?\"", "NTA\n\nI wish that someday we get to a point where it's no longer deemed inappropriate for a woman or girl to walk to a bathroom while holding a pad or tampon in their hand for all to see.\n\nUntil the day we make that socially acceptable I'll let girls who go to the toilet during my lessons grab their bag if they need it. \n\nSometimes a boy will ask why the girl takes her bag with her to the toilet and I just answer that she needs it. If he then asks why she needs it I answer that's because girls clothing does not have adequate pockets. If he keeps asking questions I'll go into an explanation that over girls hit a certain they start menstruating and that they need to carry Gemini hygiene products with them. At some point boys usually stop asking questions. Usually by that time the rest of the class is upset with them for being so oblivious, certainly all girls are by then upset with the boy.", "NTA, you didn't actually say anything wrong. Everything you said was factual... check with the science teacher, LOL. I was the person who would wave a pad in the air and make a show of it whenever the boys went \"ew she's on her period\" before putting in in my pocket. It was actually quite funny because they'd get real quiet when I wouldn't get embarrassed or outwardly upset, just dramatic \ud83e\udd23", "Is this rule actually enforceable? I'm stunned that the school allows this considering the situation and that they have not provided adequate uniform pockets or provisions in the female toilets to accommodate you.\n\nI am sad that the school has enforced a punishment for this - apart from you using his first name, which is a little disrespectful (but in this case rightfully so), you didn't do anything wrong except state what the issue was in the most anatomically correct terms.\n\nIf I were you, I'd be getting the girls together to lobby the school as this rule feels very wrong in the case of young women who may not be comfortable having their sanitary products on display.\n\nShould the teacher have an issue with students disappearing and not coming back, then he should deal with them individually instead of punishing everyone as a whole.", "This was normal wording and NTA btw\nAlso students shall be allowed to have privacy wtf\u2026.", "100% not NTA. I would ask your parents to intervene and insist the detention be erased from your records. Your teacher\u2019s rule is understandable, but unreasonable in certain circumstances. Good luck!", "Definitely not vulgar language, but if she was willing to say that... Well I think that is more embarrassing than letting possibly a couple people see you pull a pad out of your backpack.", "This isn't a good advice honestly. Her teacher doesn't need to hear about her vagina just how a female teacher doesn't need to hear about her male student's penis. We had a rule about not bringing our bag with us to the bathroom as well. The real female empowering thing to do, which we did, is just take out your pad out of your bad ,take it in your hand and go. Yes, other students will see. Yes,women have periods. It wasn't more discreet to take your whole bag with you.", "This is a made up story based on a reply to a Reddit post last week. OP read that story, fleshed it out and created a new profile to post this AITA.", "Wouldn\u2019t that be illegal in many countries? He\u2019s obviously discriminating on the basis of sex as well as humiliating his students.", "This made me feel physically sick what the fuck", "This. She shouldn't receive anything, the TEACHER should be formally disciplined.", "Yeah this. I\u2019d be absolutely furious if someone did that to my daughter. I hope by the time she gets to that point this is no longer a problem. I\u2019d absolutely be sending her in, I\u2019d love the school to challenge it. That shit just wouldn\u2019t pass here in the UK.", "Yeah - like the girl who threatened to take her shirt off accuse a teacher of sexual harassment because she walked in after a group of 8 girls into a 3 stall toilet block! You go girl! \n\nThis group of girls routinely intimidates and threatens girls trying to go to the bathroom which is why we have teachers stationed there, but at least they stick it to the teachers!", "Appropriately, I read that as \"standing ovulation\" for a moment.", "I misread that as standing ovulation and had a minor convulsion", "Op mentioned in a comment that the rule also applies for small bags/purses. She had to basically show her pads to the whole class.", ">To be clear, my teacher\u2019s policy applies to all bags. A girl once tried to take her purse to the bathroom with her, and she got chewed out in front of the class.\n\nfrom OP replies", "Absolutely NTA! \n\nHonestly, if I were OP\u2019s mom, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d let this go with any detention or punishment. I\u2019d hike this issue up the chain until OP had an apology from Misogynist Steve, and he had sensitivity training, and they changed this policy, and the whole classroom got a pizza party while we\u2019re at it. I\u2019d also encourage OP to start using \u201cvagina/vulva/menstruation\u201d in lieu of every other non derogatory word that could ever possibly be considered a cuss word. Like the orbit \u201cbiscuit eating bulldog\u201d commercial but more anatomically oriented. \n\nAnd also, start gasping audibly and clutching your pearls every time he mentions the word period at all, OP. Sarcastically call him out for his inappropriate language. Second *period* math class? Oh my CLOTS, how could he use such foul words in front of his students like that?! What is this, English class or Sex Ed?", "This is an issue to take to the school board. He was discriminating against you for being female and then gets all huffy when told the truth. This should NEVER happen to any girl in school. NTA", "I was a-lot of trouble in school and I definitely would have made an even bigger scene and ended up in more trouble. But I\u2019m a guy, so I can only somewhat understand this scenario.", "I'm curious if the PDHPE/Health teachers in this school are allowed to use \"blood\" and \"vagina\".. or are they sticking to the stork story when explaining how reproduction works? NTA in the slightest OP and you shouldn't be punished at all for this.", "Now imagine she had a deep cut on her leg that needed cleaning: remove bandage, clean, apply anti infection cream and apply new bandage. Should she have kept quiet about that, or is it okay to say: \u201chey my leg needs some cleaning up\u201d. I guess you\u2019d find it okay to explain what\u2019s gonna happen? So what\u2019s the difference? A vagina being mentioned? Grow up", "OP, you should get every period-sufferer in your school to write this speech down on a note card so they can read it out every time something like this happens. If the teacher interrupts you, insist on finishing your request/statement. I so wish I\u2019d done something like this when I was at school!", "Yeah! I had a student threaten a teacher that if she was followed with her group of 8 into a toilet with three stalls she\u2019d take her top off and make a complaint about sexual harassment! This same group of 8 girls then routinely intimidates and threatens girls who walk in on them vaping! Which is why we have teachers stationed outside of toilets to ensure they are being used for their primary purpose! \n\nGO GEN Z GIRLS!!! Don\u2019t let teachers do their jobs!", "I went to an all-girl school in England & we had teachers kick up a fuss about us going to the toilets during lessons, even when we said we were on our periods. I was given a detention because I had a panic attack during a PE lesson & I know others who were given a detention for being too graphic about their periods when teachers refused to let them go to the toilet. I left school 10 years ago so things may have improved but my school is now a mixed school, not solely for girls, so it\u2019s even more likely that it still happens now because boys are there to be offended by our biology. So, it absolutely does happen in the UK.\n\nEdited for typos/missed words.\n\nETA: A large percentage of my class actually ended up in detention once because we were on our periods & refused to/couldn\u2019t do swimming in PE. Admittedly some jumped on the bandwagon because our school pool was outside & gross but most of those involved were actually on their period but the PE teacher just thought we were causing trouble for the sake of it.", "Former teacher here. I would have been in the admim's office fighting for her.", "Those two situations are not remotely analogous.", "It's almost like she had enough of being berated by a middle age man too stupid it understand female anatomy and she snapped. Women and girls are expected to be discreet and ashamed of our periods but sometimes people refuse to make that possible.", "He's not 'policing the girls'.\n\nRead the OP. It's a rule for all the students.", "This man somehow became a teacher without actually passing a health course. Perhaps this embarrassment will make him think twice before doing this to another student.", "NTA. I'm a teacher, albeit at the college level, and it shouldn't take a genius to realize that if a young woman needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of class and take her bag with her, THERE'S PROBABLY A LEGITIMATE REASON WHY -- HINT HINT. This teacher is a moron.", "Agreed. Op needs stronger women in her life.", "And he was forever known as Misogynist Steve", "If she wasn't embarrassed about telling him, it seems unlikely she was too embarrassed to show him.\n\nStill NTA though.\n\nA girl in my school had a teacher refuse to let her go to the bathroom during a test even when she explained the urgency. She said fine, scootched down in her seat, reached in her pants and pulled her tampon out in class, then plopped it on the teacher's desk and asked if she could go now because she might have to take her pants off if she had to replace it in class too. She got suspended for like 2 weeks.", "Because schools are responsible for students all the time? Even when they are skipping class.", "I stand corrected. That\u2019s abysmal.", "Why not? The girls complain about us invading their privacy. \n\nAlso, why do you think teachers and schools put policies like this in place?", "Exactly this. Sad to see her sister trying to convince her to appease this chucklehead when OP handled this perfectly IMO.", "Okay, okay. Period pain can be bad, but it's not consistent. By bad I mean that I had renal colic pain and thought it was just my period. It didn't get better with my usual pain meds, so I got help. Even the vomiting part didn't tip me off because my sister, my mom and I, all of us have vomited in the past because of period pain. \n\nIt's not a week of constant pain, it rises and wanes, it's usually worst on day 2 or 3 for me. Day 5 and 6 are usually little back pain to completely pain free for me. No hormonal BC for me, can't take it because of the side effects, so this is a baseline period for me I guess. \n\nIf you have a week of constant heart attack pain, no, that isn't normal and find a gyno that takes you seriously. Finding one might take a while though. Sadly.", "Link to these studies?", "If students want to skip class there really isn't much the school can do to stop them. I used to cut out all the time and the only thing that got me not to was the teacher outright telling me if I did it again I'd fail it automatically. But if I didn't care about that I wouldn't even turn up to the class in the first place. You can't punish someone for a crime they didn't commit though, where's the sense in that. Schools are also responsible for the mental wellbeing of their students and putting them in these situations aren't helping anyone", "Yelling it at him and storming out is probably more the issue than her words.", "I'm imagining someone in the next stall asking \"hey, could I have one?\" and being disappointed and confused when a tampon gets passed under the barrier.", "Doritos Cotton Ranch flavour.."]}
