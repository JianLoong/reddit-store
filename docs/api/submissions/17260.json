He\u2019s in his late 50s and super strict, especially with the girls for some reason. He also has a special hatred for students who cut class, and after some kids in my hour pulled a stunt earlier this year (they asked to go to the bathroom and didn\u2019t come back to class), he\u2019s had a policy that student can\u2019t take their bags to the bathroom. His rationale is that, if students have to leave their bags behind, they\u2019ll have to come back for them. \n\nAs you can imagine, this rule has been so frustrating for the girls in the class. As you guys probably know, most women\u2019s clothing doesn\u2019t have pockets large enough to fit a pad or tampon discreetly. I\u2019ve just dealt with it by wearing bulky hoodies and putting my pads in the front pocket, but it\u2019s been really hot lately and our school has really bad quality AC, so on Thursday I didn\u2019t wear one. \n\nAnyway, about halfway through Mr, Miller\u2019s class I raised my hand and asked to go to the bathroom. He said yes, and I stood up with my bag hoping that he wouldn\u2019t notice. He noticed. He \u2018reminded\u2019 me, in that condescending way that older teachers talk down to teens, that I had to leave my bag in the classroom. (Idk how the exact convo went, but the following is the gist)\n\nMe: \u201cSorry, I need it.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller: \u201cI don\u2019t care, I make the rules in this classroom. Please go to the bathroom without your backpack or sit down.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cC\u2019mon please, I need my bag.\u201d\n\nMr. Miller: \u201cAlright I\u2019ll bite. Why in the world could you possibly need your backpack?\u201d\n\nMe (now extremely frustrated and needing to pee really bad, shouting): \u201c**Because I need a pad to soak up the blood that comes out of my vagina,** ***STEVE***\u201d \n\nI then stormed out, bag slung over my shoulder. When I got out of the bathroom, I was intercepted in the hallway by a guidance counselor and taken to the office. They called my parents and issued me a full week of  after school detention for \u201cuse of graphic and vulgar language and unauthorized walkout.\u201d (My mom negotiated it down to two sessions because I\u2019m generally a very good student and it was my first offense of this nature) \n\nI talked to my sister about it, and she said that I shouldn\u2019t have made a scene, that it *is* his classroom and I should follow his rules. She also told me that I shouldn\u2019t have disrupted class like that, and that I was making a mountain out of a molehill. Her words have me second guessing my actions, so now I\u2019m wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684119386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13hvjmj/aita_for_using_graphic_and_vulgar_language_when/", "score": 331, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah, I'd be snapping too).  \n\n\nIn the future, if something like this happens again, try shifting the embarrassment onto the other person. Like instead of yelling, when asked \"what do you need it for?\" calmly open your bag, pull out a pad, dramatically hold it out towards him and politely say your bit.

Made uncomfortable eye contact with him while I fished out my tampon. Held it straight in the air \"all good , sir\".

He asked a question he should have known the answer to. You answered honestly.  \n\nI had male teachers (and it was always male teachers) who pulled that shit.  We had a no bookbags for bathroom passes rule, but girls were allowed to have purses for obvious reasons.   Well there were male teachers that decided that purses were not permitted on bathroom passes and seemed to love trying to embarrass girls and make them squirm  and would try to stop us. I just did not give a shit about their crap and refused to be embarrassed.  So I would respond with informing them that part of puberty for women is menstruation and we had no control over when it happened,  but we did need to absorb the flow, they could reach out to the health teacher if they had any questions but I really needed to do something before I bled in the classroom.   Not all the girls felt comfortable with turning the crap back on the teachers but one girl had a relative who worked for the ACLU and had them help her write up a petition to better educate the teachers on the needs of adolescent girls.  Complete with the implication that continued denial of accommodations for needs could result in a lawsuit.  \n\nBefore anyone claims it wasn't fair the girls got to carry purses on bathroom passes, any student who needed special items during bathroom use was allowed to carry a small bag to the bathroom.  These male teachers just never bothered asked the boys why they needed to take a bag to the bathroom.", "Nta\n\nIf a man in his 50's is scared of the word vagina than he's a sheltered fool.

However a better way would have been to report him to administrators when he made the rule.  Or, walk out with your bag despite his objection , use the restroom and then go straight to administration to complain about him.  I hate those woman hating high school teachers who harass teen girls about their periods in the name of discipline.  I had a teacher like that.  Due to a medical condition I went to the nurse\u2019s off when i needed to use the restroom, and she would give me a note  with \u201cuse facilities\u201d checked to excuse my tardiness to my next class.  Mr Ochi called me out in front of the class, loudly asking \u201cuse facilities?\u201d  I looked him in the eye and replied \u201cthat\u2019s what the note says\u201d.

A friend was sitting on a stool in front of me.  When she stood she had had a leak.\n\nI walked up to the teacher, told him I was taking Sue out of the room.  Then I walked up to her, told her to leave the room and walked directly behind her, so no one saw the stain.\n\nOnce we were out of the classroom I explained why I got her out of there.

You tell him I said he's a monk.", "Neutral-TA.\n\nMale teacher here.  In 2023, if a male teacher doesn't understand why a 5th-12th grade female student might need to take their bag to the bathroom, they need to retake 6th grade health themselves.  His conduct was unforgivably ignorant.\n\nThat being said, if you used a different tone and stormed out, I think there'd have been little to no blow back.  Yelling at the teacher in front of the class and fracturing any sort of classroom management is probably why he took it to the next level.  A teacher losing respect of the class is the worst case scenario.\n\nBut other than that I am very empathetic to your situation.", "NTA you didn't handle it well but he was being unreasonable. The school needs to have a policy that allows female students to manage their periods. This should be taken further.\n\n Has the school suggested what you should have said/done instead? Having to announce you are on your period in front of the class strikes me as inappropriate (regardless of how explicit you are about it).", "ESH\n\nYour teacher absolutely needs to be understanding of feminine needs. But something about the way you wrote the post makes me think you're skewing what actually happened. \"He also has a special hatred for students who cut class.\" Well, duh? Is that so unreasonable?", "NTA, goddamn, what year is it?", "NTA. I think you need to go speak with the principal or rally some other students on this one. Your male teacher is denying you the right to take your personal items to the restroom. If you cut class and don\u2019t return, he can punish you then. But not before. \nHis \u201crule\u201d puts every person with a medically-needed item in a situation where they have to ignore the need or risk punishment or humiliation. And when you stood up for your need to take a personal item with you, he had you punished anyway. \nThe reality is that you could have quietly grabbed a pad from your bag, in full view of others, and left for the restroom, maybe slightly embarrassed. But I kinda love you for going nuclear. Please ask your mom to write you a note that you have a medical necessity to take personal items to the restroom. And then get as many other students to get the same note from their parents so that his rule is trashed.", "that's funny af you're literally just describing what a period is to him.... if that's vulgar then obviously he's sensitive. you didn't scream slurs or curse him out, just used his first name and told him you were on your period in detail. nta he needs to cope he's a grown ass man", "He asked you... so def nta", "This is the second time I have seen this story.", "NTA  but, using the teacher\u2019s first name probably crossed the line", "NTA, good on you for not being bullied by your teacher and you probably helped other females in his class who are too timid to pipe up and say anything.", "NTA.
