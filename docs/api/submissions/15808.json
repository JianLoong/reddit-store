She would show up 25% of the time maybe. The last time I contacted her about a visit was when my oldest niece was turning 5. She said she would come and I told them and she didn\u2019t. Absolutely killed my oldest niece. I never mentioned the woman again. She either showed up or didn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t tell the children we were going to the park to wait for her. Just that we were going to the park. It stopped setting them up for disappointment. I explained to them after the party that I was sorry things were the way they were and I couldn\u2019t make her come. We eventually had her rights terminated and she didn\u2019t even show up to court. They are now 8, 10, & 12. Their mom overdosed last year and died. The younger of the two don\u2019t even remember what she looked like. Painful but best for them. I can only imagine how much her death would\u2019ve impacted them had she been in and out constantly.

She pays for 100% of everything for her daughter. Her ex is also a narcissist and he's always making my niece feel unimportant, and like she's an after thought. My blood boils at the thought of the pain this little girl goes through to feel so unwanted by someone who is supposed to cherish and uplift her. Anyway, as much as I personally would want to throw away the whole man into a dumpster and light it on fire, I think it's even more important to let the child determine whether or not they still want to see their parent. At this point my niece sees her father only occasionally, and my sis supports her to determine what frequency and duration of visit are ideal.", "At 10 years old, your daughter has the mental capacity to have the conversation with you.

If he\u2019s unreliable like that it becomes even more important that your relationship with your daughter is rock solid. It is often easier to forgive someone for being wrong then it for them being right.", "Context needed - does your daughter not want to see her bio dad anymore?\n\nWhen it comes to adoption, separation, or divorce, the needs of the child should always come first. It seems clear that the bio dad isn't fulfilling basic emotional needs and causes her pain. However, your daughter is old enough to choose whether or not to see her dad anymore, despite all this. You need to have a conversation with your daughter, where you listen to her needs and desires and come to your conclusion based on what she wants.\n\nYou can't control what choices the bio dad makes. Have an honest conversation where you share your thoughts with her, and tell her that cutting visitation is an option if she wants, but that the decision is up to her. You will support her whatever decisions she makes, you will always be there to protect her no matter what, and she can change her mind later.\n\nCaveat: this, of course, depends on her safety. If she is in danger if visitation continues, ending visitation can be justified. But ending contact entirely and receiving insufficient emotional support can both be damaging, and that should be in your daughters control as much as possible.\n\nEdit to add: this situation is not about whether you're the AH to the bio dad, but whether you're the AH to your daughter. If your daughter wants to have a relationship with her bio dad and he isn't providing that to her, that's on him, he's the AH.

The most important thing you can do is involve them. It\u2019s THEIR life, not yours. Your job is to love them, provide for them, and guide them, but not force them into situations they don\u2019t want to be in (within reason. Forcing them to order their own food at a restaurant is different). Just talk to her and tell her it\u2019s her choice.

I would advise asking your daughter, but I understand wanting to protect your daughter against knowing her father cares so little about her. I don't think some people understand that this is an example of child neglect on her fathers part. If the father thinks that he shouldn't hold financial responsibility for his own daughter, then he's is neglecting financial responsibility. Kids cost money, and the fact he would sign his rights as a father away for $400/month is terrible. My father paid $200 a month and stopped paying. It sucks when you start to think you aren't even worth X amount in child support to your own parent.  Thinking of the kind of person who could do this would not sit with me well.\n\nGet her enrolled in therapy. She may not know what she feels. You don't need to cut him out of her life, but do talk with your daughter. Give her a choice and let her know you will enforce whatever she wants to do.

Get rid of him now.", "NTA cut contact that's not her dad anymore. Also your child is expressing concerns listen and top the visits.", "Yes. She is 11. When she is an adult and has control, so she can leave a situation whenever she wants to,  she\u2019ll decide how much contact she wants.", "NTA\n\nMake sure your daughter knows she can say no to meeting bio dad, she needs to know the decision is hers to make.", "What does your child want?\n\nIf he is hurting her and inconsistent and he has now been adopted then it sounds like a reasonable move.

Also, let her change her mind, this is an important part of her identity she is dealing with.\n\nIf you don't support her, she will resent you later if she decides your decision wasn't what she wanted.", "NTA but you need to get her into therapy so she can come to the realization herself that cutting/limiting contact might be in her best interest. You shouldn\u2019t have to be the enemy and she shouldn\u2019t have to feel like she has not control", "NTA, however please consider a family therapist that specializes in this before you make that decision.  It would be helpful for the both of you.", "NTA. You would be the AH if you let someone hurt your child. Stop these visits now.", "Talk with your daughter and find out what she wants.

Ask your daughter first and get her feelings on it. I've had siblings with kids get adopted to their current spouse but they usually still let visitation.  It matters what your daughter feels on this unless he is an actual danger to her.", "Speak with your daughter first and ask how she feels. If he's hurting her, she may not want to visit. If that's the case. Let her stay with you.", "This is a really complicated situation that happens sometimes in open adoptions. An adopted child will have visits with birth family, but afterwards, they experience emotional or mental upheaval. Assuming this is what you mean by \"hurting\", I strongly recommend that you and your daughter talk to a therapist. Cutting out her bio dad entirely could lead to more pain later. \n\nIf by \"hurting\" you mean he's physically abusing her, then there's no question that visits need to stop. \n\nI can't judge this situation with the information given.", "As a daughter with a bio Dad & an adopted Dad, I am thankful that my parents supported my choices about my relationship with bio dad as he dipped in & out of my life. Parental abandonment is a huge trauma, the best you can do is support your kid in making her own choices and get her into therapy to give her tools to work through the self worth issues that grow from there. \n\nShe already understands the difference between a biological contributor & parents who support, love, care, and are present in her life. You would be the asshole to take the choice to be in contact away from her.", "I completely agree with you to loop the daughter in on the conversation. I was in a similar situation when I was around 8 years old. My mam asked me and my sisters if we would like to continue seeing bio \u2018dad\u2019. It was our choice and should we decide otherwise, she would accommodate. We all made the choice to stop seeing him. Almost 2 decades later and I don\u2019t regret that decision at all. Nor did I ever have the desire to see him again. \n\nTalk to your daughter first OP and see what her feeling are.", "My dad was toxic but I still resent my mom for encouraging him to give up his rights, trying to keep me from visiting him etc. This also damaged my relationship with his side of the family. But it\u2019s pretty clear her motivations were not to protect me, it escalated to her not letting me visit him as a punishment for not doing chores etc. I would have been more grateful if she had helped me learn/understand toxic behavior and how to set boundaries. Not letting me grow up thinking it\u2019s normal to be treated the way I was. Which was impossible for her to do because she was toxic in her own way.

It sounds like going no contact with her bio dad will be good for her, but it shouldn't be forced upon her. She might not know it's a choice to stop seeing him.

And that she can always change her mind.", "This. Ask your daughter if you think she's ready for this. OR, just severely pull back and go very LC until she's ready for that kind of decision.", "It\u2019s funny, she says the pain is caused by when he misses visits, but now she wants to eliminate the visits entirely.", "Exactly! We see this a lot in open adoptions. An adoptive parent will simply end contact if a bio parent's contact results in the child experiencing any kind of negative emotion. But that's not necessarily what's best for the child. Therapy is the logical choice here.", "As someone with parents who aren't the best. It's not easy to just walk away from them. Because yes it can hurt like hell, but you still love them.\n\nAt this point the daughter just needs to know that regardless of what happens her mom will be there and supportive of her. I'd say get her in therapy, so she can either learn to create proper boundaries with him or deal with him no longer bering in her life.", "Actually it does.  Termination of parental rights involves termination of obligations as well.

I feel like any time the daughter tells OP that her bio dad did something to upset her, the very next step should be OP asking if she wanted to take some time off from visiting him or if she even wants to keep trying to maintain a relationship with him. \n\nSo, OP your daughter is giving you the signal that this is a discussion you both need to have. Talk to her and give her a choice in this.", "This isn't your choice. Your daughter may only be 11, but she is capable of choosing whether or not to see her father.

I don't know if cutting off visitation completely is the right step straight away, maybe try communicating the issue to your ex and discuss behaviors and actions that need to be addressed to improve her time with him. That being said I know how some people can get defensive and confrontational when their unpleasant behaviors are called out so if talking doesn't work I think you should go with your gut and cut off the contact. I say that as a 28F who grew up without her dad most of the time and knows fully well how that can effect a child. Her safety, and emotional wellbeing, matters more than his feelings about being cut out of her life. If he's not willing to change for her, he doesn't deserve to have her in his life.

Men will argue til they're blue in the face that men should be allowed to \"financially abort\" their kids in exchange for terminated parental rights.  He can't have his cake and eat it too.  Fuck that.  If he wants visitation he should step the fuck up and pay CS.", "As someone who was in a similar situation, I'm going to say NAH.\n\nBUT, I would recommend your daughter to make her own decision.

He will either rise to the occasion and she can have some fun with him or you can have a clear heart when you stop being the one making the effort on exes behalf. \n\nIf he\u2019s being shitty to her and she\u2019s consistently coming home upset then it\u2019s ok to cut him off right there. \n\nBut don\u2019t bother trying to have a regularly scheduled day if you know he\u2019s gonna flake or be shitty to your kid.", "As a child whose contacts to parents got cut off several times without me wanting or initiating it- it is not your Choice. You would harm your daughter deeply if you\u2018d do that. Please don\u2018t do this, it is really important not to traumatise your child more and to taint your relationship to jet with this action. If your daughter wants to cut off contact, okay. But you are not supposed to decide this for your daughter unless he is a convicted dangerous Person or drugsdealer. \nYou need to support your daughter. She might want to do low contact or Switch between low and no contact. But it is her decision. There is no easy way out of this situation. Don\u2018t believe that you can rip a relationship off like a Band aid. You might want to just exchange and get over this Guy but he has a very diff\u00e9rent relationship to your daughter. The relationship she is having with you, adoptive dad and bio dad will influence her until adulthood. It is about her ability to trust herself in relationships and her gut and to lesen how to read people. You don\u2018t want her to miss her dad and be the evil contact stopper. This things get somehow safed on a somatic emotional Level and they are nearly impossible to get rid off.

I can definitely understand the frustration and pain in the situation. Your daughter needs a say, but I would gently suggest getting a therapist involved for a couple of reasons. First, your daughter needs help processing the abandonment issues and trauma. Second, a therapist can give your daughter a neutral place to sort out what she really wants to do. Your daughter needs a safe place to weigh the options because, ultimately, it is her decision. Last, it will help alleviate pressure from you and her biological father. Whether there is any or not, she may perceive pressure or want to make you both happy.  Life decisions are tough, even as adults.  I applaud you, OP, for all the support and guidance you have given her.", "There seems to be no winning because I've been on the otherside of mum letting her kids have as much contact as possible (when deadbeat dad could be bothered) and constantly having to pick up the pieces of having the dad not show up and kids crying.\n\nWhich has left adults with abandonment issues and male figure issues.", "And if he dies in the meantime then she'll probably never forgive her.", "Has that backfired for any adoptive parents?", "Not sure what state you are in but in Massachusetts a parent cannot voluntarily terminate their rights to avoid supporting their child.

I TOTALLY think cutting out this deadbeat is the best option. HOWEVER to do so without any discussion with daughter could backfire on OP spectacularly. This, unfortunately, is still her dad and she may truly love the guy. Involving the daughter is an absolute must. Oh and NTA AS LONG as daughter is involved. 11 is old enough to have a say", "Define \"backfired\"? Cutting off all contact with bio family has resulted in further trauma for some adoptees, while for others, it was necessary and helpful. It really depends on the situation and the people involved.", "In Georgia.  But here\u2019s the thing, and it\u2019s true in most States.
