If she's not happy about the visits, she should be part of the decision to stop them. If it's done unilaterally by you, he could try and guilt her into meeting behind your back.", "NAH.\n\nIt was crazy to let him terminate parental rights to avoid paying child support then still keep hurting your daughter with the weird non-parental on and off visits.\n\nNow that it's gone on for a couple of years, you should talk to your daughter about what she wants. She's at an age where setting up visits will interfere with her extracurricular activities.", "NTA\n\nHe walked away.

I feel like you know the situation better than us.", "Your daughter's physical and emotional safety is priority #1, NTA for cutting contact. If your daughter expresses an interest in contacting her father as she gets older the decision can be reassessed.", "YTA if you don\u2019t talk to your daughter.\n\nYour child is old enough to have some say in her relationship with her dad. I would have a gentle conversation with her about what she wants. Maybe she wants some space, maybe she wants no contact, maybe she wants to keep trying.\n\nAt the moment, her father is the villain here. If you become the wall between them instead, that may be just as confusing for her (ex:maybe he would call if mom would let him). Let her guide this relationship. Honestly once she\u2019s in her teens I imagine she will give up on him.", "NTA. If your daughter is saying he's doing things that hurt, her. Put a stop to the visits. Find out what he's doing.", "NTA, as your daughter has been repeatedly hurt by him and why invite more pain? But what do you think would happen if you asked her what she wanted? I realize the thought of cutting him off may influence her to say she wants to see him even when she doesn\u2019t, which is why I ask. Really tough situation for you and I\u2019m sorry you have to make such a decision.", " NTA - if he relinquished his rights, thats that.", "NTA, he relinquished his rights.\n\nBut to be safe, ask your daughter how she'd feel about that first. She's old enough to have some say.", "WNBTA. If he's hurting her , then you need to protect your daughter.", "I would enter child into therapy whether or not dad remains in her life because he's already done damage, and she's had a lot of confusion and turmoil in her life.

This is her choice, and some people would rather have a parent who hurts them than lose their parent altogether.\n\nAbsolutely N T A if your daughter agrees with you. If she feels like it's time to cut down on visitations or end them completely, then you are absolutely in the right.", "NTA but you need to discuss this with your daughter. I was 12 when I told my mom that I was done with my bio dad. It was obvious that he was only there to get attention from her and it hurt my feelings everytime he dropped in and out of my life.", "Nta but you would be if you don\u2019t include her in the decision.", "As someone who had a parent like this. I wished that my other parent had done something. I\u2019m going with NTA. I would also suggest talking to her. Letting her tell you everything that she is feeling about this. Let it be her choice. I am so glad that she has you looking out for her.", "NTA but you really should involve your daughter in this decision process as well as get therapy for her too.   She needs to understand its not her fault that her bio dad isn't there for her at all but yo will support her if she still wants to stay in contact with him or not.", "NTA. IF he couldn't bother to pay he deserves no time. Your daughter might be upset at first, but when she's of age you should tell her the truth. Regardless of how poorly it makes her biology donor look.

He lost his privileges.", "You are disrespecting your husband by not and letting your ex walk all over your daughter.", "NTA.  Not at all.  My family has a similar situation & for the female that her bio dad was in & out of her life, she is now 30 & just starred therapy to unravel the mess inside her head due to daddy issues.  \n\nHe gave up all parental rights.  Let him track her down when she is an adult.", "NTA....But if you do \"cut off contact\" You need to be upfront with her and tell her it's **your decision** to prevent her bio father from seeing her and don't blame the bio father for walking out when he's actually expressed a desire to continue a relationship and you denied him. 10 years down the line when she decides she wants to reach out to Bio-dad and confront him and he drops the truth bomb with proof that you cut him off from seeing her, she'll resent you for it and it could destroy your relationship with her going forward.", "YTA if you cut him out of your daughter's life without including her in that decision. You've got to remember that cutting him off could also be traumatic in and of itself. I think you should also remember that she has the right to change her mind at any time. This is a relationship she has to learn how to navigate, and it's best to start now while you do have the veto power if things get dangerous. Rather than her having no contact with him until 18.", "YWBTA - Hear me out. First of all if your husband adopted her legally, he has a say in this, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be on your side but that\u2019s important to ask. Then the other person you need to talk with is your daughter. She\u2019s 11, not a baby but not an adult either. You can ask her how she feels, if she would like to see him less or not see him anymore. That\u2019s a conversation that you need to have before taking that kind of decision. If she says she still wants to try, no matter what he does to disappoint her it\u2019s your job to be here and support her, she\u2019ll be thankful to you for trying and helping her.

If you were just going to insist on continuing to attempt contact, what the fuck was the point of terminating parental rights?

The condition being that you ask her first and she says doesn't want to see him anymore. She's old enough for her opinion to be taken into account.

Personally, I think it's borderline abusive of the bio Dad to come and go at his leisure the way he has. To boot, he technically and LEGALLY \"gave her up.\" You don't get to \"play dad\" at your convenience and only when it doesn't involve money. If he can't afford his time and money to her, he doesn't deserve her. Ask her what she wants to do. Tell her that she doesn't HAVE to be hurt by him if she doesn't want to be.

He gave up parental rights and is doing things that actively harm your child full stop. Protect your girl. \n\nI\u2019m assuming the harm is emotional or mental? That still real harm and can cause lasting damage.  If it was physical I\u2019d hope you\u2019d call PD instead of going to Reddit. \n\nLet him know why you are cutting contact and if in the future he changes after getting professional help you would be open to the possibility of him being in her life again if she chooses.", "NTA but What if in 10 years he tells her about how you cut off access to her?

And let her know she can change her mind at any time.", "NTA. but please involve her in the choice. it sounds like it\u2019s something she\u2019s already thinking about, so sit down & have a mature conversation with her. has she been to therapy? that can help. i went thru a very similar situation at the age of 12 & my mom requested reunification therapy if my dad wanted visitation again. he wouldn\u2019t do it. that\u2019s a possibility if dad will do it", "NTA and yes, cut off contact.\n\nIf she changes her mind, your daughter will tell you. If she wants to see her bio dad every once in a while, she can ask for that when appropriate.\n\nMy youngest step sister cut her (cockhead of an) ex out of her kids' lives and the both of them occasionally go visit the drunk giant toddler, spend at most a few hours, then leave saying how they don't want to see him ever again. And then a year or so later, they might drop by for a visit when they're in the area (bio dad lives 7 hours away from them, but the kids' grandmother lives near-ish him.)\n\nKid-parent relationships are hard. But if your daughter is signalling that his presence hurts her, cut him off at the knees and only when she explicitly desires to see him, allow him contact. That way you limit the hurt to a minimum, and it can be her decision to one day say \"fuck this guy, I'm never talking to him again\", if that's what she wants. It won't be you preventing her from seeing the guy, but it WILL be you protecting her from him.", "NTA don\u2019t just cut contact without getting your daughters input. If she\u2019s not ready to go NC, cut back on the visits.", "Under those circumstances go for it. If you were trying to be vindictive towards an ex by using a child, I'd say it would be completely wrong. However parents do not own their children, they do not have a right to access them if they are harmful for their well-being, and that's even if they still had their parental rights intact. Children need guidance yes, but they are human beings who have the right to decide if they want to associate with someone.", "Ask her if she wants you to be the \u201cbad guy\u201d and tell him he can\u2019t visit. Let her know that when or if she ever wants to reach out it will be on her terms and you will support her. You just can\u2019t make the decision for her.", "NTA, but I feel like you should really talk to your daughter about it. She\u2019s old enough to understand. She may resent it if you make the choice for her. I got custody of my nieces and nephew at 6month, 2, & 4. Their mom was a drug addict, we had set visitation by the court. She would show up 25% of the time maybe. The last time I contacted her about a visit was when my oldest niece was turning 5. She said she would come and I told them and she didn\u2019t. Absolutely killed my oldest niece. I never mentioned the woman again. She either showed up or didn\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t tell the children we were going to the park to wait for her. Just that we were going to the park. It stopped setting them up for disappointment. I explained to them after the party that I was sorry things were the way they were and I couldn\u2019t make her come. We eventually had her rights terminated and she didn\u2019t even show up to court. They are now 8, 10, & 12. Their mom overdosed last year and died. The younger of the two don\u2019t even remember what she looked like. Painful but best for them. I can only imagine how much her death would\u2019ve impacted them had she been in and out constantly. After I stopped asking her about visitation 7 years ago I didn\u2019t hear anything else from her. She had my number. Address. Everything. I think the children were spared a lot of hurt.", "My daughter is often talking about things his is doing that is hurting her. \n\nUmm what is he doing? Do the police need to be involved?", "INFO: What does SHE want? This is all about her. Your desires shouldn't matter here.", "NTA, but 100% you need to consult your daughter. My sis is in an almost exact situation (without the remarry part). So, she is a single mother to a 9 year old. Her ex hasn't paid child support in well over a year. She pays for 100% of everything for her daughter. Her ex is also a narcissist and he's always making my niece feel unimportant, and like she's an after thought. My blood boils at the thought of the pain this little girl goes through to feel so unwanted by someone who is supposed to cherish and uplift her. Anyway, as much as I personally would want to throw away the whole man into a dumpster and light it on fire, I think it's even more important to let the child determine whether or not they still want to see their parent. At this point my niece sees her father only occasionally, and my sis supports her to determine what frequency and duration of visit are ideal.", "At 10 years old, your daughter has the mental capacity to have the conversation with you. I'd take her out to lunch (just the two of you) and ask for her thoughts. Keep the conversation very neutral and don't share your opinion. Just give your daughter the space and time to share all her thoughts about her bio dad. After she's shared, if you still feel like cutting bio dad off is the best option, ask her to share how that would impact her.
