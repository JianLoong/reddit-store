I have no idea the reason why, our conversation on the app never got to that. After messaging back and forth for about a week he asked if I want to meet up for drink next week and if interested to text him. He left his phone number so I text him, word for word:\n\n\"Hi \\[name\\]! This is \\[my name\\]. It would be great to get together next week, how about Tuesday or Thursday? I'm down to grab a drink or up for another activity since I noticed you specified on your profile you don't drink. Let me know if what you prefer!\"\n\nHis response:\n\n\"Hey \\[my name\\]. It is very inconsiderate of you to assume I can't handle going out for a drink just because I don't drink. There's something called ordering a non-alcoholic beverage. Consider our date no longer and please do not text me again.\"\n\nI never responded to him, as he asked me not to. It was never my intention to assume he could not handle being at a bar or around company that was drinking alcohol while he was not. Just thought it may be more fun for us to do something else. Also, I only drink 2-3 times a month so I was truly up for doing a non-drinking activity and thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to suggest it.\n\nI told some friends about the situation and they were split. Some said I was an asshole for overcompensating and being so forward about suggesting not going to bar. They said people in recovery may be triggered by others accommodating just for them (again, I am not sure if this is the reason he does not drink). Some friends said they see I was just trying to be considerate and my suggestion was only in the best interest of both of us doing something we enjoy more.\n\nSo AITA for suggesting not getting drinks for a first date to someone who does not drink but suggested drinks for a first date?", "created_utc": 1690088658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1575jmn/aita_for_suggesting_a_nondrinking_activity_for_a/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. That guy's got a stick up his.", "NTA. People quick to take offense over people trying to be considerate are the AH.", "Wow. That's a pretty intense instantaneous reaction to what I see as a good, thoughtful gesture.\n\nI don't drink. If I was active on dating sites, I'd include that info, and I'd like to believe I would appreciate a response like the one you gave.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to date, be friends with, or meet people you don't want to. Guy is already throwing red flags, consider yourself lucky he already ended it so you don't have to.\n\n-edit\n\nAs for suggesting a non-drinking activity, I don't see a problem there. He may have been suggesting an activity with alcohol to be considerate to you, you were just being considerate too. If he gets that pissy over the suggestion, he likely has some problems.", "NTA. As a recovering alcoholic, I rethink you were being incredibly considerate and thoughtful. A proportionate response from him would be \u201cThank you for considering that but I\u2019m totally comfortable in environments with alcohol in it so I am open to whatever.\u201d This is a stretch but my gut tells me he\u2019s probably someone who \u201cshouldn\u2019t drink\u201d and thus he put that in his profile but does drink - in other words he\u2019s an active alcoholic. Again that is a total stretch and there are plenty of other explanations I suppose. Either way, dodged a bullet \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA in the slightest. He over reacted to how you approached him, asking him if he\u2019d prefer something else, other then places with alcohol. \n\nMini Golf, Movies, Coffee. Lots of thing to do without alcohol. His reaction is very strange and rather rude.", "Wow. Totally NTA. Your message to him gave the option of drinks or no drinks. I did not read any assumptions into what you said.", "NTA. \n\nAs a non drinker myself, I would've seriously appreciated the effort. I always feel like no one wants to do anything with me if they can't drink so to have an alternative offer would've been amazing.", "You are NTA. The prospective date on the other hand was. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Don\u2019t hesitate to do the same exact thing next time you make plans with a guy who doesn\u2019t drink. Something was up with this one, maybe looking for a way out or got another match he preferred after you and he decided to be a jerk about it.", "NTA-you dodged a bullet! This guy got all weird when you were being considerate. It sounds like he might have a problem after all.", "NTA better to find out now that he\u2019s not the right one", "NTA \nI\u2019ve met people like this on dating apps but I think the problem is more the culture of dating apps. A typical date usually does involve drinking alcohol then hooking up AKA the hookup culture. It does seem kinda like his pride was hurt when you mentioned not drinking which could also mean \u201cmacho guy\u201d figure. Dodged a Bullet", "NTA His response was truly bizarre. I don\u2019t know if he was lying about not drinking on his profile for some bizarre reason (maybe he was specifically trying to hook up with someone he knew was a non drinker \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) and then he forgot when he was messaging you so he panicked? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f His response makes zero sense", "NTA  \n\n\nHe might not drink, but it seems pretty important to him that he can get his date drunk.", "Ughhh. This is hard. I think you over compensated. You could have just said yes to a drink or we can do another activity.  I don\u2019t drink, I take seizure medication and alcohol gives me instant migraines.  However, in most of my family struggle with addiction. So I cringe when people assume I don\u2019t drink because of addiction struggles. The worst is trying to explain to people who are drinking and they keep trying to shove booze down my throat, that I don\u2019t drink. They look at me like I\u2019m an alien and judgment starts setting in because they think they connected the dots, and I\u2019m firmly turning their alcohol down because I am recovering from some type of addiction.", "NTA I think it was considerate of you, but maybe poorly worded?  I would have said why don\u2019t we do a coffee date instead or do you want to come check out this market with me? Instead of being so blunt about it.  Ultimately it was his decision to go to a drinking establishment so obviously he is comfortable going to that kind of environment.  \n\nI think he was the AH with how he responded.  I think you dodged a bullet, if he snaps like that over an honest question than imagine how he would respond in a more serious situation.", "NTA. That's weird.", "NTA at all, he posted a detail and you tried to respect that in your message.  Thankfully he showed you right off the bat who he is.\n\nAs some others have noted, drinks are a good first date idea but that doesn\u2019t have to be a bar.  A simple \u201cTuesday works for me.  I\u2019ve read good things about XYZ-NotABar, would you like to try it?\u201d", "Absolutely NTA. You were trying to be considerate and it comes across clearly. Sounds like he is projecting. What a rude, unnecessary response.", "NTA. If he didn\u2019t want people to mention it, he didn\u2019t need to include it in his bio \ud83d\ude44", "Le grand Yikes", "You dodged a bullet. Thank you, next.", "NTA but I wonder if he wanted you to drink so he could take advantage.", "Guy is a loose cannon. Probably fragile from nursing a regrettable hangover \ud83d\ude35\n\n\nHere\u2019s the thing; you\u2019re dating to eventually marry. Why start off by doing something only one of you can actively partake in? Bad start.", "NTA because I believe you had good intentions.  However you should have just suggested an actual non drinking activity instead of pointing the info on his profile out. His reaction was a little strong and sounds like he wouldn\u2019t be a good match anyways.", "I think YTA. I also dont drink...at all. People find that hard to believe since EVERYONE has to have a drink. I dont like it and break out in red hives.   I would be insulted if you thought I couldnt be around people that drink or go to a bar etc. Not everyone who doesnt drink is \"in recovery\" and it is very rude of you to assume so.

You were very nice about it, you took the time to read his profile, which shows that you're considerate.  \n\nI'm a sober alcoholic, but there are other reasons someone might not drink (namely religious, sometimes personal preference).  I would have really liked your response!  Even though I am comfortable going out for drinks, it can get boring drinking coca-cola while others are getting tipsy. \n\nThe fact is, online dating is weird.
