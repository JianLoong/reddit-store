I have no idea the reason why, our conversation on the app never got to that.

He left his phone number so I text him, word for word:\n\n\"Hi \\[name\\]! This is \\[my name\\]. It would be great to get together next week, how about Tuesday or Thursday? I'm down to grab a drink or up for another activity since I noticed you specified on your profile you don't drink. Let me know if what you prefer!\"\n\nHis response:\n\n\"Hey \\[my name\\]. It is very inconsiderate of you to assume I can't handle going out for a drink just because I don't drink. There's something called ordering a non-alcoholic beverage. Consider our date no longer and please do not text me again.\"\n\nI never responded to him, as he asked me not to. It was never my intention to assume he could not handle being at a bar or around company that was drinking alcohol while he was not. Just thought it may be more fun for us to do something else. Also, I only drink 2-3 times a month so I was truly up for doing a non-drinking activity and thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to suggest it.\n\nI told some friends about the situation and they were split. Some said I was an asshole for overcompensating and being so forward about suggesting not going to bar. They said people in recovery may be triggered by others accommodating just for them (again, I am not sure if this is the reason he does not drink).

He may have been suggesting an activity with alcohol to be considerate to you, you were just being considerate too. If he gets that pissy over the suggestion, he likely has some problems.", "NTA. As a recovering alcoholic, I rethink you were being incredibly considerate and thoughtful. A proportionate response from him would be \u201cThank you for considering that but I\u2019m totally comfortable in environments with alcohol in it so I am open to whatever.\u201d This is a stretch but my gut tells me he\u2019s probably someone who \u201cshouldn\u2019t drink\u201d and thus he put that in his profile but does drink - in other words he\u2019s an active alcoholic. Again that is a total stretch and there are plenty of other explanations I suppose. Either way, dodged a bullet \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA in the slightest. He over reacted to how you approached him, asking him if he\u2019d prefer something else, other then places with alcohol. \n\nMini Golf, Movies, Coffee. Lots of thing to do without alcohol.

I always feel like no one wants to do anything with me if they can't drink so to have an alternative offer would've been amazing.", "You are NTA. The prospective date on the other hand was. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Don\u2019t hesitate to do the same exact thing next time you make plans with a guy who doesn\u2019t drink. Something was up with this one, maybe looking for a way out or got another match he preferred after you and he decided to be a jerk about it.", "NTA-you dodged a bullet!

This is hard. I think you over compensated. You could have just said yes to a drink or we can do another activity.  I don\u2019t drink, I take seizure medication and alcohol gives me instant migraines.  However, in most of my family struggle with addiction. So I cringe when people assume I don\u2019t drink because of addiction struggles. The worst is trying to explain to people who are drinking and they keep trying to shove booze down my throat, that I don\u2019t drink. They look at me like I\u2019m an alien and judgment starts setting in because they think they connected the dots, and I\u2019m firmly turning their alcohol down because I am recovering from some type of addiction.", "NTA I think it was considerate of you, but maybe poorly worded?  I would have said why don\u2019t we do a coffee date instead or do you want to come check out this market with me? Instead of being so blunt about it.  Ultimately it was his decision to go to a drinking establishment so obviously he is comfortable going to that kind of environment.  \n\nI think he was the AH with how he responded.  I think you dodged a bullet, if he snaps like that over an honest question than imagine how he would respond in a more serious situation.", "NTA.

People find that hard to believe since EVERYONE has to have a drink. I dont like it and break out in red hives.

I don't (really) drink, but I can, and have, had a night on the town with friends where several drinks were consumed.

He may have been planning on drinking. \n\nI am a non drinker by choice. No reason other than I like tasty drinks and alcohol dehydrates me.

It's great that he showed his, let's say, grumpy attitude right up front. Next", "NTA. He's obviously still sensitive about it, overly so in my opinion but not drinking is a journey not a destination.

He would then cautiously accept, and graciously forgive her when they met and she\u2019d be so happy to have earned his approval.", "Most people would be happy to know you actually paid attention to what their profile said\u2026", "I think your comment was fine - you were up for getting a drink with him. You don't need to walk on eggshells.", "Yeeeep. As others have said, if *this* was enough to set him off, bullet fucking dodged.", "I don't drink, and the way someone reacts to that fact is a good litmus test for dates and even for friendship. \n\nThe weirder people act, the soberer I get, lol.", "Your beautiful whimsical prose could, sadly, not survive the scrutiny of harsh horticultural reality.", "Thanks for this! I was recently stood up for a date because he said he didn't get 'a good feeling' 15 min before meeting. I was wondering what I had done, but the truth is I dodged a bullet.", "I was wondering the same. \n\nBeing sober doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be around alcohol and yes non-alcoholic drinks do exist, but a person who doesn\u2019t drink *because* of previous issues with alcohol suggesting grabbing a drink for a first date makes no sense. \n\nIf the intent is a more casual meet up to feel each other\u2019s vibe, coffee, ice cream/dessert, are all options that accomplish the same thing.", "ESH. \n\nI wouldn't say you are an AH for what you said but it does seem really odd to have even bothered to mention drinking and his lack of drinking. \n\nAs someone who doesn't drink, growing up around people who did drink, the amount of comments and 'jokes' I have had from people who drink about my not drinking is just too much. It gets tiring. Whether he is in recovery or not, you knew he didn't drink so I find it odd that you even bothered to mention it. \n\nYou could have just suggested the non-drinking activities \\[without mentioning the lack of drinking at all\\] to begin with rather than going straight to a drink then 'oh but we can do something else because you don't drink.' \n\nI get that people think it is 'nice' but it's honestly annoying and exhausting after a while having people just always mentioning your lack of drinking, whether it's meant as an insult or not. You can just make the date not around drinking without being like \"Hey you don't drink!\"", "I honestly thought this was his intention after reading this post. His reaction didn\u2019t make much sense other than that he was trying to loosen OP up with alcohol to lower her defenses, and though OP might have been on to him so decided to cover with that reaction.", "I was thinking dry drunk. He might have quit, but he hasn't unpacked any of his baggage.", "Oh, that was my spot for dates. The bar down the road and then the club near my house. I knew the bar tenders, the bouncers, my friends were always at one or the other.", "Or just have her nicely pliable as a result of a few drinks.", "agree. this is the defensive response of a raging alcoholic.  I waitress and I can't tell you the number of times people get bent out of shape when I ask them if they want something to drink, maybe if I said \"there's something called non alcoholic drinks\" my customers wouldn't feel so triggered.  op dodged a bullet", "actually, sounds more like he needs to get laid.  In order to do so, however, he might need to go out for a drink, alcoholic or otherwise, with someone.  \n\nUnfortunately, he's not willing to do #2 to eventually do #1, so, he's stuck in a vicious cycle.", "\u201cDry Drunk\u201d, you nailed it", "*Ad hoc, ad loc, and quid pro quo! So little time! So much to know!*", "NTA, what you Did was considerate, and he is not the kind of person that makes a good partner.

Sounds like someone forced to not drink to me, like on probation.  My friends that are sober and in recovery would not have responded like that to you.", "From the other side of this most people don't like to go drinking with someone who isn't at all. I would much rather do a different activity than drink alone.", "Why would I invite someone to go out and ski if they don't like skiing?\n\nWhy would I take someone to a sushi bar that hates sushi? \n\nIt just doesn't make sense and you clearly have some issues with people not respecting you don't drink but you're projecting a ton here.", "Damn near killed em.", "Ah, the good old armchair psychological analysis at work.", "Yeah, but for me it's the part where  she thinks 'getting a drink' is an activity that needs to have alcohol. That's just weird to me. But I guess it's just me.", "I guess she could have asked \u201cDo you want to go get coffee?\u201d but even as someone who doesn\u2019t drink, if someone proposed an evening date just called \u201cgetting drinks\u201d (especially if at a bar) I would assume that meant alcohol.  If they said dinner and drinks, maybe not.  Or anything else \u201cand drinks\u201d I wouldn\u2019t think that was just focused on alcohol.

It's a completely far-fetched theory. Why would he advertise that he doesn't drink if his goal is to somehow pressure someone to drink more against their will and rape them? Wouldn't he just not mention it and pretend to also be drunk so it's in the grey confusing area of \"we both were super drunk and had sex, can't really remember if anyone did anything wrong' instead of the obvious \"call the cops\" situation you're daydreaming about?", "It's not remotely far-fetched"]}
