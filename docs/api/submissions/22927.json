He left his phone number so I text him, word for word:\n\n\"Hi \\[name\\]! This is \\[my name\\]. It would be great to get together next week, how about Tuesday or Thursday?

Consider our date no longer and please do not text me again.\"\n\nI never responded to him, as he asked me not to. It was never my intention to assume he could not handle being at a bar or around company that was drinking alcohol while he was not. Just thought it may be more fun for us to do something else.

Some said I was an asshole for overcompensating and being so forward about suggesting not going to bar. They said people in recovery may be triggered by others accommodating just for them (again, I am not sure if this is the reason he does not drink).

That's a pretty intense instantaneous reaction to what I see as a good, thoughtful gesture.\n\nI don't drink.

He may have been suggesting an activity with alcohol to be considerate to you, you were just being considerate too. If he gets that pissy over the suggestion, he likely has some problems.", "NTA. As a recovering alcoholic, I rethink you were being incredibly considerate and thoughtful. A proportionate response from him would be \u201cThank you for considering that but I\u2019m totally comfortable in environments with alcohol in it so I am open to whatever.\u201d This is a stretch but my gut tells me he\u2019s probably someone who \u201cshouldn\u2019t drink\u201d and thus he put that in his profile but does drink - in other words he\u2019s an active alcoholic. Again that is a total stretch and there are plenty of other explanations I suppose. Either way, dodged a bullet \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA in the slightest. He over reacted to how you approached him, asking him if he\u2019d prefer something else, other then places with alcohol. \n\nMini Golf, Movies, Coffee. Lots of thing to do without alcohol.

I always feel like no one wants to do anything with me if they can't drink so to have an alternative offer would've been amazing.", "You are NTA. The prospective date on the other hand was. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Don\u2019t hesitate to do the same exact thing next time you make plans with a guy who doesn\u2019t drink. Something was up with this one, maybe looking for a way out or got another match he preferred after you and he decided to be a jerk about it.", "NTA-you dodged a bullet!

It sounds like he might have a problem after all.", "NTA better to find out now that he\u2019s not the right one", "NTA \nI\u2019ve met people like this on dating apps but I think the problem is more the culture of dating apps. A typical date usually does involve drinking alcohol then hooking up AKA the hookup culture.

I don\u2019t know if he was lying about not drinking on his profile for some bizarre reason (maybe he was specifically trying to hook up with someone he knew was a non drinker \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) and then he forgot when he was messaging you so he panicked? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f His response makes zero sense", "NTA  \n\n\nHe might not drink, but it seems pretty important to him that he can get his date drunk.", "Ughhh. This is hard. I think you over compensated. You could have just said yes to a drink or we can do another activity.  I don\u2019t drink, I take seizure medication and alcohol gives me instant migraines.  However, in most of my family struggle with addiction. So I cringe when people assume I don\u2019t drink because of addiction struggles. The worst is trying to explain to people who are drinking and they keep trying to shove booze down my throat, that I don\u2019t drink. They look at me like I\u2019m an alien and judgment starts setting in because they think they connected the dots, and I\u2019m firmly turning their alcohol down because I am recovering from some type of addiction.", "NTA I think it was considerate of you, but maybe poorly worded?  I would have said why don\u2019t we do a coffee date instead or do you want to come check out this market with me? Instead of being so blunt about it.  Ultimately it was his decision to go to a drinking establishment so obviously he is comfortable going to that kind of environment.  \n\nI think he was the AH with how he responded.  I think you dodged a bullet, if he snaps like that over an honest question than imagine how he would respond in a more serious situation.", "NTA. That's weird.", "NTA at all, he posted a detail and you tried to respect that in your message.  Thankfully he showed you right off the bat who he is.\n\nAs some others have noted, drinks are a good first date idea but that doesn\u2019t have to be a bar.  A simple \u201cTuesday works for me.

Why start off by doing something only one of you can actively partake in? Bad start.", "NTA because I believe you had good intentions.  However you should have just suggested an actual non drinking activity instead of pointing the info on his profile out. His reaction was a little strong and sounds like he wouldn\u2019t be a good match anyways.", "I think YTA. I also dont drink...at all. People find that hard to believe since EVERYONE has to have a drink. I dont like it and break out in red hives.   I would be insulted if you thought I couldnt be around people that drink or go to a bar etc. Not everyone who doesnt drink is \"in recovery\" and it is very rude of you to assume so.

Bit of an unequal playing field\nNTA for suggesting a different activity", "NTA\nAs the person that doesn't drink, I'm constantly assumed as the safe DD and would have been absolutely thrilled that someone on a first date wanted to be around me, and not use it as an excuse to drink with a drive home. \nThe one advice piece I would suggest is do replace the blanket \"non alcoholic activity\" with specific ideas. Sometimes that planning and decision of what to do is the hard part. If you're both talking about a shared interest in books offer to go to a bookstore and both get a new book, gives you something to connect on and have a continued conversation. Even just finding a park and going for a walk and people watching can be a good idea that avoids the awkward \"what do you want to do\" back and forth.", "You\u2019re fine. One of your offers was in fact, going for a drink. \nHe\u2019s being weird. Next!", "NTA, and you dodged a red flag. We don\u2019t even need to speculate what his issues are; we already know he\u2019s got a chip on his shoulder that makes him act rudely to people trying to accommodate his preferences.", "You're better off. People who seek reasons to feel like victims are exhausting to be around.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. Definitely dodged a bullet, as others have said. Also, maybe this is just me being paranoid, but why would a non-drinker want to go out for drinks? Seems weird to go on a first date where one person is drinking, and the other is sober. Then again, if he had any ill intent, he probably wouldn't have shut things down so abruptly. He definitely sounds emotionally unstable, at the least, so you for sure dodged a bullet either way, OP.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t assume he couldn\u2019t handle going out for drinks, you said going out for drinks would be fine *or* you could do something else! You said yes to getting drinks!", "He\u2019s an insufferable prick by the sounds of things NTA", "You dodged a bullet.", "I don't drink, want to go out for drinks?  OP dodged a moron I think.  NTA", ">You could have just said yes to a drink or we can do another activity\n\nWell that's exactly what OP said though?", "Are we the assholes for being polite now? You were polite, that\u2019s all, consider yourself lucky to get such an early warning that this guy is not someone you\u2019d want to date. \u201cHey honey, for dinner I\u2019m thinking going out but we can also have the leftover lasagna if you want?\u201d \u201cHow dare you assume I can\u2019t afford to go to a restaurant, screw you and your old lasagna, I\u2019m leaving \u201c. Um ok I just asked? \ud83d\ude02", "You're fine, he was being a jackass with that snarky response. You dodged a bullet", "So much hair splitting and bending over backwards to figure out all the subtle nuances of this guy\u2019s feelings and you haven\u2019t even met yet. That is just so exhausting. You said something perfectly fine and normal and he went out of his way to find something wrong with it. You said something considerate and he called you inconsiderate. This person is not being reasonable. NTA.", "Please don't listen to this person. You gave clear and direct communication that showed effort (you read his profile) and consideration. Those are 3 skills VAULED in an adult *healthy* relationship. Don't change that because you're second guessing yourself or one person says you should have beat around the bush. You did just fine and the dude is AH.", "Exactly!\n\nAnd he could have more red flags, in fact probably so,no loss..not one bit.", "Like their dog dying, or losing a job, or not getting laid or simply just being unhinged and never learning how to properly process emotions. Being this emotionally immature (and nutso) isn't an automatic \"oh he's jaded from dating\""]}
