He left his phone number so I text him, word for word:\n\n\"Hi \\[name\\]! This is \\[my name\\]. It would be great to get together next week, how about Tuesday or Thursday?

Consider our date no longer and please do not text me again.\"\n\nI never responded to him, as he asked me not to. It was never my intention to assume he could not handle being at a bar or around company that was drinking alcohol while he was not. Just thought it may be more fun for us to do something else.

Some said I was an asshole for overcompensating and being so forward about suggesting not going to bar. They said people in recovery may be triggered by others accommodating just for them (again, I am not sure if this is the reason he does not drink).

That's a pretty intense instantaneous reaction to what I see as a good, thoughtful gesture.\n\nI don't drink.

He may have been suggesting an activity with alcohol to be considerate to you, you were just being considerate too. If he gets that pissy over the suggestion, he likely has some problems.", "NTA. As a recovering alcoholic, I rethink you were being incredibly considerate and thoughtful. A proportionate response from him would be \u201cThank you for considering that but I\u2019m totally comfortable in environments with alcohol in it so I am open to whatever.\u201d This is a stretch but my gut tells me he\u2019s probably someone who \u201cshouldn\u2019t drink\u201d and thus he put that in his profile but does drink - in other words he\u2019s an active alcoholic. Again that is a total stretch and there are plenty of other explanations I suppose. Either way, dodged a bullet \u270c\ufe0f", "NTA in the slightest. He over reacted to how you approached him, asking him if he\u2019d prefer something else, other then places with alcohol. \n\nMini Golf, Movies, Coffee. Lots of thing to do without alcohol.

I always feel like no one wants to do anything with me if they can't drink so to have an alternative offer would've been amazing.", "You are NTA. The prospective date on the other hand was. You dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Don\u2019t hesitate to do the same exact thing next time you make plans with a guy who doesn\u2019t drink. Something was up with this one, maybe looking for a way out or got another match he preferred after you and he decided to be a jerk about it.", "NTA-you dodged a bullet!

It sounds like he might have a problem after all.", "NTA better to find out now that he\u2019s not the right one", "NTA \nI\u2019ve met people like this on dating apps but I think the problem is more the culture of dating apps. A typical date usually does involve drinking alcohol then hooking up AKA the hookup culture.

I don\u2019t know if he was lying about not drinking on his profile for some bizarre reason (maybe he was specifically trying to hook up with someone he knew was a non drinker \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) and then he forgot when he was messaging you so he panicked? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f His response makes zero sense", "NTA  \n\n\nHe might not drink, but it seems pretty important to him that he can get his date drunk.", "Ughhh. This is hard. I think you over compensated. You could have just said yes to a drink or we can do another activity.  I don\u2019t drink, I take seizure medication and alcohol gives me instant migraines.  However, in most of my family struggle with addiction. So I cringe when people assume I don\u2019t drink because of addiction struggles. The worst is trying to explain to people who are drinking and they keep trying to shove booze down my throat, that I don\u2019t drink. They look at me like I\u2019m an alien and judgment starts setting in because they think they connected the dots, and I\u2019m firmly turning their alcohol down because I am recovering from some type of addiction.", "NTA I think it was considerate of you, but maybe poorly worded?  I would have said why don\u2019t we do a coffee date instead or do you want to come check out this market with me? Instead of being so blunt about it.  Ultimately it was his decision to go to a drinking establishment so obviously he is comfortable going to that kind of environment.  \n\nI think he was the AH with how he responded.  I think you dodged a bullet, if he snaps like that over an honest question than imagine how he would respond in a more serious situation.", "NTA. That's weird.", "NTA at all, he posted a detail and you tried to respect that in your message.  Thankfully he showed you right off the bat who he is.\n\nAs some others have noted, drinks are a good first date idea but that doesn\u2019t have to be a bar.  A simple \u201cTuesday works for me.

Why start off by doing something only one of you can actively partake in? Bad start.", "NTA because I believe you had good intentions.  However you should have just suggested an actual non drinking activity instead of pointing the info on his profile out. His reaction was a little strong and sounds like he wouldn\u2019t be a good match anyways.", "I think YTA. I also dont drink...at all. People find that hard to believe since EVERYONE has to have a drink. I dont like it and break out in red hives.   I would be insulted if you thought I couldnt be around people that drink or go to a bar etc. Not everyone who doesnt drink is \"in recovery\" and it is very rude of you to assume so.

I've struggled with some intense feelings when I went sober some that got directed at people who didn't deserve that. He shouldn't have been so abrupt about it, at the same time he's going through something he didn't communicate. \n\nYou're actually really considerate for noticing and suggesting it. Don't take it personally.", "NTA , you said what you thought to be the right thing . A lucky escape imo as he sounds whiny and totally not a gentleman at all.", "NTA you were just asking a question. He could have said: oh anywhere is just fine, I don't mind other people drinking.\n\nHe chose not to do that. Don't date him", "NTA. The guy is insane. As someone that doesn\u2019t drink I\u2019d be very happy for my date to directly ask to do something that doesn\u2019t involve drinking.", "NTA.  At all.  Such a weird reaction from him.", "NTA - unnecessarily aggressive response from him. Dodged a bullet.", "NTA - guy is an attention seeking idiot!", "His response makes absolutely no sense. You were trying to be nice and considerate. It didn't come across as condescending or anything, so I don't understand why he got mad. You dodged a bullet. NTA.", "NTA, your actions were considerate and showed you paid attention, not only that - you yourself were less inclined to go drinking, if you can't negotiate now what's the point continuing.\n\nThe other side of my mind wonders why a non drinker would like to take his dates drinking and have such a non-negotiable attitude towards any other form of first date. Caf\u00e9s exist.. consider me questioning his character on that alone.", "Hi name,\nYes sure let's meet up, next week, Tue or Thu. Around [time] would work for me either days. How does it sound for you? Do you have somewhere in mind? \n\nThe guy said \"meeting up for a drink\", he does not get into alcohol or non alcohol drinks, nor a place or a timing. Whatever his relationship with alcohol, it is still possible to catch up in a bar, a public place with different beverages and food to have. You indeed read a bit too much here, underlying the possible inconsistencies between his text and his profile... Ppl who don't drink alcohol still drink to be hydrated...\n\nPersonally, if I throw out such an invite, share my number like he did, it would be to let the other person make the \"decisive move\" of initiate dialog out of the dating app. Which is rather polite from an unknown guy who do not know if you'd be reluctant to go to this specific next step.\n\nWould I say that he is right and you were a AH. Nope. He is a bit overreacting I would take it as a real interest in me and a bit of an overthinker...", "NTA. You were trying to be considerate. If this situation happens again, just ask where he wold like to meet up. You dodged a bullet with his attitude.", "NTA but writing this out is a lot of overthinking for a guy you never met turning out to be a bit of a weirdo.", "You're nta. That was a thoughtful offer. \n\nYou dodged a bullet here.. Or, really, the bullet dodged you.", "NTA. Lol this dude did you a favor.", "NTA. Strange thing for someone to get upset about.", "What in the walking red flag \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02. You dodged a bullet big time.\n\nI\u2019m a guy and I don\u2019t drink at all because I\u2019ve watched my dad struggle with alcohol and ruin my family many times throughout my life. If you would\u2019ve messaged me that I would\u2019ve immediately been so much more eager to meet you just for the consideration and kindness instead of the usual judgement because everyone expects everyone to drink. You sound like a keeper and he sounds incredibly insecure and psycho. Best of luck", "You dodged a bullet!", "NTA. What strange behavior", "NTA. You were considerate and even offered options. He could choose one and explain it nicely. You know this person for only a week and that particular topic abt no-drinking never came up. You don't owe him anything.", "NTA\n\nWhew - BULLET DODGED. I cannot stand people like this. The way they make you dance is infuriating.", "i don\u2019t drink and if someone did this, i\u2019d feel respected. I dont know seems like you dodged a bullet with that one lol", "NTA You dodged a bullet.", "NTA but he probably saw it as \"hey I wanna hang out and drink but since you don't then I guess we can do something else if you want since it's you who doesn't wanna do what I want\"  in his eyes implying that his preference was you settling rather than actually wanting it too.", "On one hand, yes, but then he's the one who suggested the drink, so there was no need to offer another solution? \nI mean he would have suggested something else if that's what he wanted.\n\n\nAlso, (and I'm aware that's not OP's case) it kind of sends the message that going to have a drink if there's no alcool doesn't seem interesting to OP...\n\n\nThat said is reaction is a bit wild and OP was trying to be mindful, so NTA \n\n\nBut who knows how many stupid things the guy heard when it comes to him not drinking alcohol, he might not have any patience left to offer lol \n\n\nI have friends who don't drink alcohol, often because of a taste thing, and damn ppl tend to be stupid about it, trying to push it on them or/and thinking they can't have fun because of it", "This is just a huge red and weird flag. OP just consider this a bullet dodged. Sounds totally insufferable and if it ever came to anything, there would likely be a ton more of this for other stuff.\n\nSomeone getting offended at you being considerate, but ultimately not minding on the outcome either way and just giving them options, is not someone worth your time.\n\nThey've shown you who they are before you even get to a date. Easy pass and move on.\n\nAlso to your other posts, being kind/considerate shouldn't trigger someone. Your friends sound like they'd enable someone being that daft.", "NTA.\n\n\nI went on a date with a guy who didn't drink, didn't know till we were at the place and I had already had a drink while waiting for him. We were supposed to go drinking and then dancing. He proceeded to buy me drinks and shots and try to grope me all night. Turns out his born again Christian nonsense didn't include the phrase *drunk cant consent* and it was like fending off the giant squid all night. I had to get the bouncer to safely extract me and get friends to save me.", "Consider him single as a cucumber for the rest of his days lol", "Well said. OP is NTA. I think he got his feelings hurt, thinking that OP was insinuating that he has no self control. Doesn't sound like he's in a good place if he's gonna feel insulted that easily.", "Dear lawd his response was a red flag. Lucky escape", "I thought it was more he writes he doesn't drink to make girls feel more comfortable because a drunk girl is easier to assault. Which, is what someone tried to do to me and probably would have succeeded had an awesome bouncer not called my friends (small city bar, when you're a regular things get cozy) and got me extracted.", "Yeah, this reaction wasn\u2019t just a red flag it was alarm bells.", "Good call! Didn't think of that, but that would be one explanation for his strong reaction", "Ooh I hadn\u2019t even considered that perspective. I wonder if that\u2019s true and he had more sinister motives which is why he flipped his lid at her response.", "I thought the same thing too. He wanted to stay sober while his date drinks.", "They didn't actually assume anything. All they did was see that alcohol was listed as something that they don't drink, and was trying to be considered that for whatever reason it might be, due to religion or addiction or just in general not liking alcohol. \n\nOpie was trying to be considerate, by suggesting an alternate activity other than drinks. And the fact that he overreacted to that extreme, shows that OP is the one who dodged a bullet.\n\nJust because someone suggests an alternative to drinking when they know you won't, does not mean that they're assuming you're in recovery. It doesn't mean that they're assuming anything other than taking you at your word that you don't drink. If you feel offended that somebody is suggesting something that you can participate in to the fullest, then you're the one who has issues and you need to work that out yourself. Not put them on other people.", "Non-drinker who used to have a problem here. \n\nIf your polite and reasonable suggestion was a trigger for him, he isn't ready to be dating and needs to spend time getting himself together first. \n\nYou did nothing wrong there. Probably dodged a bullet too since his reaction was weird.", "I think you\u2019re NTA and that you dodged a bullet.", "OP how dare you be so polite and considerate to him \ud83d\ude02 NTA I mean you dodged a huggggeeeee bullet thank god you never went on a date with that dude who\u2019s obviously a walking red flag. Who specifies they don\u2019t drink and gets mad when you\u2019re nice about it? \n\nDude could have been in recovery and it\u2019s not like you even jumped to conclusions about why he had it in his bio. You just offered to do something else instead of drinking which me personally would prefer for a date anyways so you dodged a bullet", "How on Earth would you know that? Maybe it was jis religion, or he just didn't like drinking or was bored of drinking culture - no way to tell.\n\nNTA - this guy was childish and your friends are needlessly playing Devils Advocate.", "NTA. \n\nYou just avoided a massive bullet, that was coming surrounded by an army of red flags and nukes.\n\nYou are so lucky. The trash took himself out by himself.\n\nYou said nothing wrong. He took it personal for no apparent reason.\nIf triggered, he could have explained so. He's just a massive AH.", "you also specifically said \u201cgrab a drink OR\u201d! you dodged a bullet, absolute NTA.", "Sounds like he's easily triggered & you'd be in a relationship walking on egg shells just incase you inadvertently trigger him. You've dodged a bullet.", "You are right. But he did you a huuuge favor! And now you don\u2019t have to date him. Because if he does this the chances are he does more stuff like this.", "I have 'never' filled in in the drinking section as well and your suggestion is very considered imo. NTA.\n\nIt is actually a turn off to me when people suggest bars when they know I don't drink (edit) without giving other suggestions", "This is reddit and we always love the drama, so I'm gonna suggest this guy maybe isn't abstinent and in fact is secretly drinking. The only two reasons I can think of for why someone would get mad about this are 1) you wanted to drink or 2) you feel someone is questioning whether you're truly abstinent and you're gaslighting them to distract from the truth.", "I'll just throw this out there... just because he is a nondrinker doesn't mean he's struggled with alcohol.\n\nHe could have a medical issue. He could be religious. \n\nBut no matter what the reason is... not drinking can make you feel pretty \"other\" -especially when you're young. Especially when you're meeting new people.\n\nThere was a bluntness in the phrasing that didn't just offer a non-alcoholic date, it drew attention to his sobriety. \n\nI still think you're NTA. In fact I think NAH.\n\nBut maybe gentler phrasing could have helped avoid this miscommunication", "NTA If he's \"triggered\" because ur somehow just supposed to know that when tho he doesn't drink he's cool with going to a bar, then he ain't ready to b dating. He's either making wild assumptions based on nothing, a newly recovered alcoholic, a narcissist or maybe a bit insane (that one's a joke). U really dodged a bullet here. He indicated he doesn't drink, it's courteous of u and shows u paid attention when u suggested an non-alcohol related activity. Plus, y would he assume u would want to have alcohol?", "As someone who doesn\u2019t drink. There is something wrong with this person. Like they want their partner to be compromised while they are lucid. A normal non-drinker would jump at the chance to be in an alcohol free venue. \n\nConsider this bullet dodged. NTA", "Don't think a second thought about it. Sounds like you dodged a bullet tbf. He sounds like a moody AH that can't see someone was trying to be considerate.", "> Like it would come across as \"are you sure you want to do that?\". Idk...\n\nI would take that as caring and considerate. For example I\u2019m super scared of heights and think it\u2019s super sweet when friends remember that and ask if I\u2019m sure I want to go certain places or do certain things", "He clearly has problems if your message upsets him that much. It's a good decision to not meet with him.", "NTA what if YOU don\u2019t like to drink alcohol? He specified it and got upset about it I think you dodged a bullet there girl", "That is what you were doing. I can see how it could come across as \u201care you sure you want to do that?\u201d but honestly only to someone who is in a vulnerable spot with their alcoholism.", "I don\u2019t think the tone of your text reads as judgmental or critical at all.", "That doesn\u2019t even make sense. It would be triggering if it were opposite and you were insisting on drinking. This guy was strange and too severe. You were trying to be accommodating which is a good thing. Probably dodged a bullet.", "Or put something in her drink at least", "Yep, overcompensating with the deflection.", "Don't worry about wordings and \"maybe this\" scenarios\n\nYour messaging was spot on - you showed you read his full profile and took notes and responded to the detail of it without making a big deal of it. If he did not want that detail noted or commented on, he should not have  put it there. \n\nI don't drink - never have, but the reason is - just never got into the habit. I have been in bars and such with friends and colleagues, where I have enjoyed all sorts of non-alcoholic drinks. But I have never made it a point to mention this - I just tell the server my choice and continue chatting. And I have never taken offence at others who (sometimes) speculated - \"how many days sober?\" (All my life and counting); \"bad liver/stomach? \" (Nope, no complaints there); \"Religion?\" (No, am an atheist)\n\nThe point is - if he took so much umbrage at you being thoughtful and also clear-communucating, what all would he get upset about once you had met? You really dodged a bullet.", "Honey you did nothing wrong.  You said nothing wrong.  Stop trying to contort yourself to accommodate an asshole.", "He already agreed to go out for a drink on the app, there was no need to ask him to confirm it. When you texted him you were basically saying \"wait, I thought you don't drink??\"", "Honestly the wording is irrelevant here, since you assumed nothing- giving both options and merely referencing what you'd seen on his profile. He's beyond touchy and not worth another moment of our time.", "Honestly, if this guy is in a space where someone offering to do a non-drinking activity for a first date genuinely triggers him, how is he expecting to function in a relationship? Does he get upset if someone suggests going to the movies? Or if there\u2019s a musical they think it would be fun to see together? Or an awesome ice cream place they\u2019d love to try out on a hot summer\u2019s day? OP, you dodged a bullet here.", "He's single for a reason then.", "A lot of times in dating when you think \"But wait, what did I do?\" The answer is \"dodged a bullet\"", "That is mine.", "Your theory makes a lot of sense!", "His over the top reaction supports this theory.", "That was my immediate thought too.", "BINGO this was my thought exactly.  This guy wasn't planning on drinking, but he sure wanted his date to.", "I'd say the whole situation was a red flag. Why would someone who doesn't drink want to take someone for a drink on a first date? Why does he want her to drink? I'm not wording this very well, I'm trying to be too polite. I would not be going in a date with a total stranger who possibly wants to get me drunk while he remains totally sober. And his reaction backs this up for me, he blew up at her because if they did something else then she wouldn't be inebriated!", "That is such a good perspective. Mind blown!", "Yeah, maybe I'm jaded, but I thought the same. I don't trust people who insist you drink while they stay sober, unless they're good friends it's a no from me.", "The guy actually sounds like the asshole,", "I totally agree with you here. That was my exact thought. Being someone who no longer drinks I don\u2019t go for drinks anymore obviously so why does this guy want to go for \u201cdrinks\u201d other than to get her drunk and maybe take advantage of that? It\u2019s odd and a big red flag", "It's a hard thing to realize in the moment, but when you're on a third date with a girl and she finds out your birthday is in November and gets angry because you're a Sagittarius but your bumble profile says \"Leo\" and you say \"I didn't know I was a Sagittarius and I must have just accidentally chosen Leo\" and she just gets even more angry and says \"Well you can't just give people false information like that!\" and then leaves the restaurant and you think \"What the fuck just happened?\" eventually you'll realize that the answer is \"dodged a bullet\"", "Guess we\u2019re all a bit jaded, because same", "That doesn't excuse it or make it okay though. Taking your anger out about something that's not even related on somebody who is trying to be courteous to you, is not okay.", "Yeah, people are just like this sometimes. Sure it stems from somewhere. But it\u2019s not like \u201cSorry, I didn\u2019t sleep well.\u201d It\u2019s like \u201cSorry, I have exhibited anti-social behavior since puberty.\u201d", "...aaaand same."]}
