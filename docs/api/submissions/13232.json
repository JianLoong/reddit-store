We had fun Friday night and Saturday but Saturday night was just difficult with weather and Ubers and heels.\n\nAs we\u2019re leaving the 3rd spot, Cee finds a man standing by a store and starts making out with him in the corner. She\u2019s my friend and this is nothing new so I go talk to his friend to keep him busy for maybe ten minutes before he abruptly walks away. Okay, cool, New York dudes. He comes back later while I\u2019m with Tu and I tell him politely to leave me alone I\u2019m not interested. He tried joking it off but quickly sees i\u2019m serious and moved, I appreciated it. \n\nWhen he turned to leave he made his friend (who was with Cee) come with him so Cee met back up with us. I told her I wasn\u2019t feeling his friend. She told us she was going to fuck him that night but in the bathroom since all three of us were sharing a king. Again, no problem. \n\nWe get back to the room around 5 am and she calls him. Ten minutes later she says okay I\u2019m gonna go and meets her friend in the lobby. When she comes back up, she turns the corner of the room and looks at me with a \u2018don\u2019t be mad\u2019 face and I\u2019m confused. She lets two dudes walk into the space and it\u2019s her friend and his from earlier that I didn\u2019t like. \n\nI made it clear to all parties earlier that I don\u2019t like that guy. He spends the next hour invading my personal space and not taking no for an answer, almost chasing me around my 8x8 hotel room where Tu was asleep and Cee was getting railed in the bathroom. I decided I had enough and went to sit in the lobby. \n\nIt\u2019s a little after 6 and I\u2019m dozing off on the lobby couches now. I figured Cee would tell them to leave when she\u2019s done and I would go back up then. I left my phone in the room so I couldn\u2019t talk to her. \n\nI woke up around 7:15 and went back up to the room where the dude I ran from is sitting outside our door, saying he\u2019s sorry. I go in the room and see Cee and her friend sprawled out on the bed and Tu on the edge, snoring. I decided then that I\u2019m packing my bag and looking for another room to sleep before taking the bus home. The guy was trying to convince me not to go so I told him don\u2019t let them worry, when everyone wakes up tell them I went home early because I don\u2019t have a place to sleep.\n\nSo I left. They started calling around 8 am and I ignored their calls. I had already been up all night and was on my way to the bus terminal in an Uber, it was an inappropriate time and I was upset, I wanted to calm down. They called 30 times but I ignored them until the NYPD calls me.\n\nI explained the situation and told them I told someone in the room where I was, they\u2019re being dramatic and everything was closed. I came home and tried to text her and see that I\u2019m blocked on every platform. I thought she would have calmed down by now but she still hasn\u2019t.

No lost there as a friend.", "St. Paddy's, not St. Patty!", "some people REALY REALLY decided COVID was over. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nNTA but you all need to grow up seriously. 25? by the end I thought I had read the ages wrong and these were all 16-year-olds.", "NTA\n\nIt just kept going and going and going - you are so much more patient than I am - there were so many steps during all that where I would have blown my fucking top.\n\nLike, actually, yes, it is a huge problem if you want to fuck a stranger in the bathroom of my bedroom!!\n\nShe SHOULD be embarrassed.", "Your friends are dumbasses. They did you a favor by blocking you. Block them back then delete their contact info. She screwed your over and is acting like the victim? Let them go", "NTA but in the future text them \u201cI\u2019m going to the bus terminal - my guess is that the guy didn\u2019t relay the message and they were worried, not dramatic", "Sweet Jesus, what the hell did I just read? This so called friend of yours is trash, not because of her hooking up activity but that she allowed it to cloud her judgement and put you and your other friend at risk. Dump that chick and get a better social circle.", "NTA at all. It\u2019s good they\u2019ve blocked you, saves you having to block them.  As much as it sucks to write of a friend, it sounds like you deserve a lot better", "NTA, you need new friends. Your friend put you in a dangerous situation. Don't ever go out with them again and defdo not share a room with them", "Basically the same thing happened to me with a \u201cfriend\u201d in college. Except the guy I wanted nothing to do with ended up raping me while my \u201cfriend\u201d was having a nice time with the guy she wanted. Fuck that friend, fuck everyone involved. I\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t hurt. Cut ties. You don\u2019t need this crap.", "I\u2019m going to be honest. Everyone in this story is a few years too old to be making such shitty decisions. ESH, because at the end of the day, who you\u2019re friends with also reflects on you, and it\u2019s pretty abysmal that even after all this, YOU weren\u2019t the one to pull the plug here on the friendship, she was. \n\nHaving fun and partying is great and all, but it\u2019s practically asking for some dark shit to befall one of you by inviting multiple complete strangers into your hotel room in the middle of the night from the sidewalk in Manhattan during a huge holiday. If this is commonplace for you or your friends, and based on your tone, it appears to be, you need to *really* self-reflect and see if this is where you think you should be at 25 years old.", "NTA, get better friends before you end up on Mr. Nightmare, girl.", "NTA and make sure EVERYONE in your circle on social media knows how disturbing and dangerous your friends were", "Not to burst your bubble, but he only wrote his name as Patricius when he wrote letters. Padraig is the Irish version of the name, but he never wrote it as such.", "Completely agree. Plus Patty is usually short for Patricia, not Patrick. As an Irish person it's intolerable \ud83e\udd23 it's Paddy's Day at the very least  \u2618 \u2618", "OP didn\u2019t even ruin her fun too Cee is just awful and puts everyone in danger then won\u2019t admit it.", "I like to refer to it as Catholism killing cultures day(Irish edition). But that ruins people's buzz, so I keep it to myself generally.", "Editing to add judgement: NTA.", "Yeah, it really does.  There could have been rape and assault, you all got really, really lucky.\n\nHer behaviour endangered her friends for no good reason, random street dick is not worth this kind of appalling risk.  Does she often act this recklessly and impulsively?  There may be something going on with her in that respect but it is NOT your problem.\n\nI'm glad she blocked you, I'm glad you're done with her.  She took an absolutely unforgivable risk with your and Tu's safety for sex with a stranger, and that's not how friends behave.  \n\nYou should not feel bad for protecting yourself, though you should talk to Tu and work things out with her.  She was left with strange men by both of her friends and she could have had a terrible experience.  All of you don't seem to have realized how close to the edge you were walking, how bad things could have gone.", "NTA and Cee is not your friend; she endangered Tu and you on purpose. Next time you travel alone or with actual friends, Amazon sells lock that you can put in your hotel door to keep others out. Also, take a self-defense class.", "You definitely should have woken Tu up so she could have made a decision herself about being left with an aggressive man alone.\n\nBut you\u2019re NTA for removing yourself from an unsafe situation. \n\nThis entire story is wild, none of it was safe and could go wrong in numerous ways", "ESH.\nYour friends are obviously assholes. Other users have explained all that so I won\u2019t get into it.\nBut I want to explain why you are also an asshole here. \n\n1. You let the friend back into the room. Maybe this was unavoidable in the situation so it may be excused for your own safety, but it\u2019s still a bad move.\n\n2. You told the friend, a man that by your own admission is not a safe person, to pass along a message to your friends. You don\u2019t trust him, except with keeping your friends from worrying about your safety? I don\u2019t follow your logic here.\n\n3. You let your friends worry to the point where they caused the police. I understand that you were very reasonably angry with them and didn\u2019t want to talk to them. You still could have texted them \u201cI\u2019m safe, I\u2019m on my way home, I won\u2019t be answering your calls.\u201d Then you could have blocked them. Or you could have written a note and left it in the room for them. But you literally said you didn\u2019t want your friends to worry, put the onus on this unsafe stranger to handle that responsibility, and then let them be so worried they called the police. \n\nYour friends completely suck, but you need to know you also acted poorly here.", "If this isn't the first time her sex life has caused you grief, that's a sign that you should find someone else to hang out with. \n\nIt's one thing to withhold judgment, it's another to withhold common sense, which could get you injured or killed. \n\nIt's really fortunate you were able to book a room for yourself. Take care. NTA.", "She was raised differently? As in she's never watched SVU? So many ways that could have gone badly", "She put you and Tu at direct risk of sexual assault. She was beyond inconsiderate to the point of being truly awful. \n\nJudge her, see that she is lacking in basic respect for you and realize that she is not someone worth being friends with.", "> I love her, she\u2019s my friend. I just don\u2019t get why she\u2019s reacting this way\n\nBecause she doesn\u2019t care about you in the slightest, only herself, and is not your friend.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, but you *really* need to understand that.", "She's not a good friend.  Seriously no one else's sex life should cause you trouble more than once.  She has no moral compass.  Not all relationships last forever, this one has run its course.  Her risk taking shouldn't include risks for you.  That guy could've raped you!", "Your 'friend' put you in a position where it was almost impossible to say no. She literally set you up to be raped. That is not a friend. That is someone who uses you to feel better about herself. Please, make better choices in friends.", "It's a bugbear in Ireland.  It's St Paddy's day.  Not Patty's.  It absolutely enrages some people.", "Yeah, I doubt he ever referred to himself as \"Patty\" or \"Paddy\" at all \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f not sure what your point is", "St. Patrick's Day is a thing because St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland and one of the names the Irish call him is Paddy. The Irish don't call him Patty so calling the Day St. Patty's Day is incorrect.", "She betrayed YOU, do you want her in your life?  Two strangers in your room and one was expecting sex from you to the point you left to get another room!  You don't owe her an apology for not cooperating with her messed up plans.", "You really don't have to apologize to her, dear.  She risked you and Tu's safety and you should consider yourself lucky that you guys no longer talk anymore.  I know you think she is your bestie, but anyone who would drag other people in danger should be shunned as friend.  What if next time people she brought back harmed you or whoever was traveling with you.  \nThe thing is Cee never respects you as a human being otherwise she wouldn't bring guys back to shared hotel room.  Look at this way, if you won't do the same thing as Cee did to any one, why would you let her do it to you??", "It is possible that the guy relayed a skewed or completely difference message to the one you gave him, possibly in an attempt to deflect suspicion of his behaviour and part in your disappearance from the shared room.\n\nYou blanked your friends when they made dozens of attempts to contact you, to the point that they escalated it to the police.\n\nIt is unlikely the police relayed whatever answers you gave them beyond the she's safe.  But if they did reveal some of what you shared - if you had told the cops that you were being made unsafe by a man your friend brought into your shared bedroom - then your friends might not be happy with the police's response.\n\nAs I commented above, I do understand why you didn't want to talk to them. But because you didn't talk to them, or message them, you have no idea what information they were provided to explain your departure and that might explain why she's blocked you. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's blocked you because she is well aware of her own part in this and is afraid that you will, justifiably, blame her so she's pre-emptively blocked a message she doesn't want to receive.", "Down with the Patty\u2019s!! \n\ud83d\ude02", "exactly this!!! plus he was refusing to take no for answer and chasing her around.  dump and block this so called friend.", "RIGHT?! I can't believe these weren't kids. This was so crazy unsafe on so many levels. I hope this is a wake up call", " \nI won't try to fix anything, just cut your losses and move on.", "But I\u2019m going to guess that the creepy guy didn\u2019t pass on the message about where you were going,", "They just need educated a little bit \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 hopefully some of them have learned something today \ud83e\udd23", "They might\u2019ve done you a favor by blocking you.", "My first college roommate ambushed me with an \u201cintervention.\u201d She said I needed therapy because I sat up all night in the common area rather than sleep in the bed 3 ft from hers when her FWB was visiting.
