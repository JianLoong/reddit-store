We had fun Friday night and Saturday but Saturday night was just difficult with weather and Ubers and heels.\n\nAs we\u2019re leaving the 3rd spot, Cee finds a man standing by a store and starts making out with him in the corner. She\u2019s my friend and this is nothing new so I go talk to his friend to keep him busy for maybe ten minutes before he abruptly walks away. Okay, cool, New York dudes. He comes back later while I\u2019m with Tu and I tell him politely to leave me alone I\u2019m not interested. He tried joking it off but quickly sees i\u2019m serious and moved, I appreciated it. \n\nWhen he turned to leave he made his friend (who was with Cee) come with him so Cee met back up with us. I told her I wasn\u2019t feeling his friend. She told us she was going to fuck him that night but in the bathroom since all three of us were sharing a king. Again, no problem. \n\nWe get back to the room around 5 am and she calls him. Ten minutes later she says okay I\u2019m gonna go and meets her friend in the lobby. When she comes back up, she turns the corner of the room and looks at me with a \u2018don\u2019t be mad\u2019 face and I\u2019m confused. She lets two dudes walk into the space and it\u2019s her friend and his from earlier that I didn\u2019t like. \n\nI made it clear to all parties earlier that I don\u2019t like that guy. He spends the next hour invading my personal space and not taking no for an answer, almost chasing me around my 8x8 hotel room where Tu was asleep and Cee was getting railed in the bathroom. I decided I had enough and went to sit in the lobby. \n\nIt\u2019s a little after 6 and I\u2019m dozing off on the lobby couches now. I figured Cee would tell them to leave when she\u2019s done and I would go back up then. I left my phone in the room so I couldn\u2019t talk to her. \n\nI woke up around 7:15 and went back up to the room where the dude I ran from is sitting outside our door, saying he\u2019s sorry. I go in the room and see Cee and her friend sprawled out on the bed and Tu on the edge, snoring. I decided then that I\u2019m packing my bag and looking for another room to sleep before taking the bus home. The guy was trying to convince me not to go so I told him don\u2019t let them worry, when everyone wakes up tell them I went home early because I don\u2019t have a place to sleep.\n\nSo I left. They started calling around 8 am and I ignored their calls. I had already been up all night and was on my way to the bus terminal in an Uber, it was an inappropriate time and I was upset, I wanted to calm down. They called 30 times but I ignored them until the NYPD calls me.\n\nI explained the situation and told them I told someone in the room where I was, they\u2019re being dramatic and everything was closed. I came home and tried to text her and see that I\u2019m blocked on every platform. I thought she would have calmed down by now but she still hasn\u2019t.
