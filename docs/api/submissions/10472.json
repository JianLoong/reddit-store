Had they not been assholes maybe you would have been more accommodating (still unable to drink the alcohol, but maybe not make them take it back to the room). Respect goes a long way and they showed you none. \n\nPoring it out may have been a bit much since you could have just taken it and had them grab it after, but they were being assholes so I see where this was also a consideration since perhaps a violent confrontation may have arisen with other options.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's a bar near me with a beer store that sells single beers but you can't drink the beers in the bar or on the patio -- it's clearly posted.

They just got up and left.", "No kidding, not sure where they are but if it was in the US 18 is not legal drinking age anyway so there was no reason to have it at the table because she couldn\u2019t legally drink it in the restaurant anyway.

I\u2019ve worked at bars a lot before, and there\u2019s varying degrees of how strict I will be about people bending or breaking the rules, especially in a place like a ski lodge where the clientele is different than like, say, a bar on a Main Street in a big city. \nIf a customer is bent on bending liquor license rules, then they had better be going out of their way to hide it (so you both have plausible deniability) and also like, being kind and respectful. If they act like assholes like this group did I am 100% bringing down EVERY possible rule on them, to the letter. You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA at all. I used to work as a bartender.
