{"id": 7085, "submission_id": "109e76r", "title": "AITA for saying I'll never bring my stepdaughter on a family vacation again?", "selftext": "Background: I (36f) have been married to my husband (44m) for 8 years. He has one daughter from his previous marriage (22f) and we have two children together (5&2f). Stepdaughter is in her final year of school, and husband asked her what did she want to do to celebrate. She wanted to go to DisneyWorld. We decided to do it over her's and our oldest's winter break so no one would miss any school. We just got back earlier this week. \n\nWe paid for everything - park tickets, husband paid for her airfare because she did not want to drive down with us from SC to FL. Husband paid for lodging, I paid for park tix for all of us, and food. Husband also gave stepdaughter $400 in spending money, just to have so she could buy herself whatever she wanted without worrying. It is worth mentioning that my husband fully supports SD while she's finishing up school - her mother does not offer any type of support and as far as I know, SD and her mom are no-contact.\n\nSD made the trip...very frustrating. She tried to dictate where we ate (she is pescatarian and tried to push for vegetarian/pescatarian restaurants. I cannot eat fish due to a shellfish allergy) She got visibly upset when I ordered a steak dish. She wanted to do character dining which at Disney runs about $300-400 per meal. But, she also complained about the food not being \"up to her taste\". Complained about sore feet, the weather, how tired she was, etc. At one point, husband told her to \"suck it up\" and enjoy it.\n\nThe reason why I feel like I never want to invite her on a trip again is due to her treating out 5 year old like a total annoyance. This is our first, and probably last trip to Disney ever, so our 5 year old was just blown away by how awesome everything was. SD kept rushing her, talking down to her, at one point told 5 year old that she needed to \"respect her older sister and stop whining\" when 5 year old had a slight meltdown over being told no when she asked for a treat. At one point, SD told husband that 5 year old was being a \"brat\" and that's when I solidified my decision that if we ever did a family vacation again, she would not be brought along.\n\nAll said & done, we spent about 5k between her airfare, park tickets, lodging, food, and her spending money. She has not said thank you or shown any gratitude/appreciation for everything we did. Husband said she's just being a \"dumb 22 year old who doesn't know how good she's got it\" and that I'm being \"unfair\" to her because our two children will probably have more vacations than she ever did because of my husband and first wife splitting up. \n\nAITA here reddit?", "created_utc": 1673467013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109e76r/aita_for_saying_ill_never_bring_my_stepdaughter/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband offered *her* a vacation to celebrate *her* finishing school, not a vacation for you to celebrate you or your other kids. So it kind of makes sense that she woukd be allowed to choose where to eat and what to do there. Realistically it seems like there is a good chance she didnt expect stepmom and littke kids to get dragged along after her dad asked her how she wanted to celebrate her accomplishment, leading her to be a little bitter and unappreciative. If she hadnt been mean to a five year old, this woukd have been a straight YTA, because the kid is innocent in this, but withher taking her bitterness out in a childim going to have to go with ESH.", "Sheesh. I mean, she does sound like a \u201cdumb 22 year old.\u201d But you can\u2019t control the relationship between your husband and his daughter. I would say that you can legitimately say that YOU will not go on any vacations with her any more, but if he wants to take his daughter on a vacation, you have no right to forbid it either. Your sole recourse would be to just not participate yourself. And you don\u2019t have the right to guilt trip your husband about him spending time or money on his daughter either. That would make you TA.\n\nTo me, her actions seem annoying but not horrific. If you want to make an issue of it with your husband and risk driving a wedge between him and you over it because of some immature behavior\u2026well, that\u2019s your call.", "YTA. There\u2019s no need to make any decisions or pronouncements about future trips right now. Odds are you won\u2019t have another family vacation with her. Once your adult kids get into the workforce, it can be pretty hard to find a time when everyone can make it & a place everyone wants to go. That said, better planning would have made Disney a much better trip. Just curious- when your stepdaughter said she wanted to go to Disney, did she say she wanted to go with the whole family? Because I think that\u2019s where your problems started. She thought one kind of trip, & you planned a different one. Even then, planning around their ages would have helped. A 22 year old & a 5 year old are going to experience the park in a much different way, & you should have planned time, maybe a majority of the time, that they didn\u2019t have to be together.  The littles can hang out with the magic tea cups, & the stepdaughter and someone else can hit the rollercoasters or some other attraction not suitable for little kids.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to decide that she\u2019s not part of the family.", "NTA\n\nOP, your SD is a grown adult and can choose and pay for her own vacations.\n\n> Husband said she's just being a \"dumb 22 year old who doesn't know how good she's got it\" \n\nAnd who's fault is that Dad?", "ESH.  It sounds like this was her trip - a gift for the end of school.  It's her last hoorah so she can be the diva (to a degree).  And she's an adult and can pay for/go on her own vacation from here on out.\n\nBut you should absolutely take your young kids to Disney again when they're between 11-14.  I think that's the sweet spot for Disney World.", "I get it.. I do, she was irritating. But also- \u201cshe will never come on vacation with us again\u201d- you\u2019ve solidified your own little family. If it were your grown birth daughter being a brat on a trip, you wouldn\u2019t say she won\u2019t be coming on vacation with you again. You also act super entitled to what her dad spends on her- that\u2019s the worst. They had a financial relationship before you entered the chat. I can\u2019t stand this step parent dynamic.", "INFO: Have you talked to your husband about your decision? Or did you make it for the both of you?", "NTA.\n\nIt's not unreasonable for her to suggest restaurants that she can actually eat at. She doesn't eat meat, so meat-heavy restaurants aren't useful for her. But it sounds like she's not treating your 5 year old well.\n\nRealistically, she's not coming on more vacations with you anyway. She's 22, and she's finishing up college. She's going to get a job and do her own thing. So your resolution not to take her on another vacation is probably moot.", "ESH, the fact that your husband asked her where SHE wanted to go for her graduation celebration, implies that she be given some kind of control when it comes to where to eat and what to do on said vacation. She probably didn't expect it to turn into a family vacation even if she did choose a place that your little ones would probably enjoy going to. I realize you guys paid for it, but you kind of implied you would pay for it from the start when your husband asked where she wanted to go. I'm sure she didn't think that she would have to pay for it when her dad said he wanted to treat her for her graduation.\n\nShe took it way too far when she got upset at you for ordering steak and when she scolded your child. If she really thought the 5-year-old was going too slow or being bratty then she could have gone off on her own or had time set aside for just her and her dad to spend time together, instead of causing a rift. Sure, it probably would have been less fun on her own but at least she could have done exactly what she wanted when she wanted.", "ESH\n\nIt was a trip for her. So one could say that maybe you and the kids should have stayed home. It wasn\u2019t meant to be a \u201cfamily vacay\u201d.\n\nAnd the 5YO probably was being a brat because that\u2019s what little kids do when they\u2019re tired, hungry, or overwhelmed. \n\nSD sounds like a spoiled ingrate but that\u2019s your husband\u2019s fault. \n\nAs she\u2019s now a young adult, perhaps you plan more age appropriate trips with the little kids and skip the stuff with her. \n\nI dunno. I stopped going on trips with my step kids and my (ex) husband\u2019s family and ironically, the last trip and straw that broke the camel\u2019s back for me was Disney. \n\nBut realistically? You can\u2019t just cut other people in the family out of family vacay. All you can do is remove yourself and it doesn\u2019t play well. But no reason for you to be miserable on your limited vacay time from work. I just started vacationing separately with friends and everyone was happy except my in-laws. I doubt you\u2019ll get the same but in from your husband.", "ESH. Really, you don't have to make a big production out of it. The reality is, this probably WAS the last family trip with her. Most girls in their 20s don't travel with stepmom and dad and the littles. The venue itself, DisneyWorld, is the only reason why this became a family trip. Just file this away as a bad idea you guys once tried and move on. Going forward, just bear in mind that repeating this is a bad idea.", "ESH.\n\nYeah, she sounds annoying.\n\nBut Y T A also because\n\na) banning her is not your unilateral decision to make,\n\nb) banning her from \"family vacations\" is a tad extreme considering at worst she was complaining (who TF doesn't get sore feet and overwhelmed and annoyed by Disney and little children, particularly if you're not used to little children around) and particular about food - you act like she physically assaulted your five year old and threw a rampage destroying the hotel room, and\n\nc) I'm not even sure why this was a \"family vacation\" in the first place.  It sounds like this was her graduation celebration/present.  So, this makes it HER trip which you co-opted into a family vacation and made it about yourself and your 2 and 5 year old and then got annoyed with the things she wanted to do on a trip that was supposed to be her celebration.  In fact, I'm sure she would have rathered you and the kids not gone at all and just done the trip with her dad or was hoping that you'd all just give her the tickets and money to go and then she organized a trip with a friend.  If her pick had been something not 2 and 5 year old friendly, would they still have gone or would it have been solely her celebration trip?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA:  I also guarantee at some point in the future, your 5 year old will be calling their younger sibling a brat or worse.  It's just the territory that comes with siblings.", "NTA for not wanting her to come, but this has to be a joint decision.", "This is a tough one OP. She does sure sound ungrateful but your husband doesn't seem to be on board with your POV.  And he seems like he's kind of enabling her crap attitude.\n\nThis might be situation of\n\nESH (except the young kids)", "The whole trip was a gift to SD for finishing school, she prob choose it thinking of all fun things she wanted to do there and I understand if she gets a little annoyed for needing to wait etc.\nAnd yeah I understand  why you are annoyed at her also.\nBUT what I can't understand why you simply couldn't split up? That would have solved almost everything.\nYou don't wanna eat where she eats, eat somewhere else.\nThe 5yo slowing you down, split up and let some hurry up and the others walk.\n\nAlso, from the way you write it feels like you doesnt really care much for SD, with a tiny bit yealousy, which makes me think that you either left something out in the story or exaggerates.\n\nAs to the question about not letting SD come along on any future family vaccations, yes YWBTA if you do so.", "NTA.  She's 22. \"Never again\" might be a little drastic to say out loud, but yeah, that would be her last if she were my own kid. She needs to grow up.", "NTA. She behaved horribly. I wouldn\u2019t have acted this way at 22. Nope. She\u2019s an adult now. She can take her own vacations.", "22 yo and 5 yo and you and husband all have different needs. Going to DW with all the costs and those different needs is not the best idea. She didnt say thank you and was not polite to your daughter - hopefully all those issues were addressed right away when they happened (like you offer her DW and she says nothing, ask her why not a thank you?; rude to sister - cut this right away) and you guys split for a bit so needs are met (22yo could spend few hours with dad and you with 2 kids going on kiddie rides/resting). But this all done, and I think it doesnt do anybody any favours to say that it is.last trip, we wont take u again. Even if you think that and this is what is going to happen.

You weren't there and it's unreasonable to prevent your kids from experiencing vacations and LIFE just because his first daughter didnt' have the same opportunities.\n\nNTA.

She's still talking about how \"Stepdaughter's name called me a brat\" and just never even said \"Hey thanks dad and stepmom for putting this all together at the very last minute\" because I was genuinely not expecting her to want to do Disney. It was my husband who suggested we all go as a family and I really didn't have much input in saying yes or not. It was presented to me as \"Stepdaughter wants to do this for graduation, we're all going. Can you pay for park tickets?\"", "I have no idea if he asked her if it was OK for us all to come along or not. I was genuinely not expecting her to want to do Disney. It was my husband who suggested we all go as a family and I really didn't have much input in saying yes or not. It was presented to me as \"Stepdaughter wants to do this for graduation, we're all going. Can you pay for park tickets?\"", "This right here op. if it was your child you would never exclude them family events, that\u2019s where I think your in the wrong. I mainly point NTA, but this is definitely something to consider.", "Hahaha. I mean, I get why he wants to support her. I've never questioned it or anything but he has admitted he can't wait until she graduates and gets a job so he isn't stuck paying her rent and bills anymore. It seems like every week she's overdrafting and is asking us to help her out", "Not very surprising behavior. She's just gotten worse as she's gotten older. The last time we saw her, in November, she kept complaining about our youngest being a \"shitty baby\" and made the remark of \"when I have kids, they won't tantrum like my little sisters do\". She's also made the remark that my husband \"owes\" her for not being in her childhood very much due to her mother moving her several states away when her parents were divorced.", "OP never said she was stopping her SD from spending time with her dad. She said no more vacations. If SD can't act like the adult she is and is intent on just being shitty the entire time then she doesn't deserve to go.", "Why did you make this comment so long?", ">SD has made remarks about how my husband didn't \"try hard enough\" in her eyes to be in her life. So he feels guilty and is doing his best to make up for it.\n\nAnd now she's NC with her mother... \n\nI think your SD is now under the impression that she's entitled to special treatment and your husband has allowed that impression to continue.    She's an adult now and she needs to behave like one.   Her being annoying wasn't an issue, her picking on your 5 year old is a huge issue.", "Actually in this economy, and being a student, a lot of 22 year olds in college still get financial help. That\u2019s besides the point, she was his daughter before this woman was his wife. She became a step parent when this girl was already grown (16). Don\u2019t come in and try to interfere in any established parent-child relationship.", "You are being so protective of your 5 year old because she threw a tantrum and got called a brat as a result. \n\nMeanwhile, your stepdaughter is on holiday with her dad and his new family, with his two new baby daughters who probably take up all of his time and whom she probably barely knows given she\u2019s finishing college, she doesn\u2019t have her own mother around, her stepmother\u2019s dining desires apparently come before hers (not wanting to go to a fish restaurant is fine, but what\u2019s wrong with going to a vegetarian one half the time? Do you not eat vegetables), and now because of one comment her stepmother thinks she can ban her from all future family holidays?\n\nHow would you feel if you weren\u2019t around and your daughters were treated this way by their new stepmother and their dad\u2019s new family?\n\nHave a little empathy.", "I spent around the same amount on a trip with my own mum. We went to see sibling and their spouse in a foreign country and we wont be seeing them for some time too. Mum exhibited similar behaviour as your SD. Will I take her and fund her holiday again? Yes, she is family. Did I rip her a new one because of her being an entitled brat? Yes, I did too. At this point, you need to decide if SD is family or not to you and act accordingly.", "\u201cI\u2019m not preventing her from seeing him, I\u2019m just preventing her from seeing him when I\u2019m around, or when it involves family events, because his daughter is not his family anymore.\u201d", "Is it really that big a deal for an older sister to call a younger sister a brat?  That just doesn't seem like a \"huge issue\" to me.", "It was her grad gift. To some extent she did get to dictate the details because it was HER trip. The kids just came along because it was also ace appropriate for them, but it\u2019s wasn\u2019t THEIR trip. OP was generous in providing financial support for the trip, but again, it was SD\u2019s gift, and we don\u2019t hold gifts over our adult children\u2019s heads.", "Really agree with this comment, great take bravo!! Step mom you\u2019re being too harsh on your step daughter.", "She is 23.", "I mean she isn't wrong. He could have made concessions but it seems that his ties with her were not that important.", "It literally doesn't say that anywhere so idk what your quoting.", "> SD kept rushing her, talking down to her, at one point told 5 year old that she needed to \"respect her older sister and stop whining\" when 5 year old had a slight meltdown over being told no when she asked for a treat. At one point, SD told husband that 5 year old was being a \"brat\" and that's when I solidified my decision that if we ever did a family vacation again, she would not be brought along.\n\nThat's not just calling your younger sister a brat.   That's an adult behaving like a child.", "OP seems very resentful of how much it cost, to be fair, I\u2019m curious how much of it actually came from HER income vs how much of it came from her HUSBAND\u2019S.", "Exactly. She\u2019ll remember this response from her stepmother for the rest of her life. The 5 year old will barely even remember the trip, let alone being called a brat whilst throwing a tantrum.", "It\u2019s called \u201creading to understand.\u201d She didn\u2019t SAY those words, but that\u2019s what it means when you decide that your step children are no longer invited to family events."]}
