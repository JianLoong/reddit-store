I get why she didn't want to help me look for the dog but I can't get over the lack of empathy and bordering selfish behavior of this either. \n\nMy dog (6yo Heeler/Corgi mix) runs off at least once a week. Usually my fiance will help me find her but it's not without protest. I honestly didn't even know how she was getting out of our fenced yard so I installed cameras and found that she was scaling the 8ft fence. I ended up attaching \"spinners\" to the top of the fence thinking that would solve the issue but it didn't. I brought her out today and was playing with her when my phone rang. I was inside just long enough to grab my phone and my dog had gotten out.  I immediately went in search for her, thinking she couldn't have gotten far but I couldn't find her anywhere so I went back to the house and asked my fiance, who was curled up on the sofa, to come help me. She immediately said no. She said she was tired of chasing the dog, that she isn't dealing with it anymore and that I should have been out there watching her. I explained to her that I had been watching her and simply stepped away for point two seconds to grab my phone just inside the sliding door and she had escaped. She again said it wasn't her problem and she's not exhausting herself anymore to search for my dog. I won't even say it was unexpected because as I said, in the past she has always had a problem with helping me search but she's never said no. She just complained about it. \n\nAt first I went and searched myself. After maybe a half hour I came back and asked her again to come help me and she snapped \"I said no! I am so tired of chasing that dog around multiple times a week when I'm already exhausted and throwing up constantly.\" I was panicked and unleashed some yelling, which involved me telling her she was a bitch who lacked empathy and that I was thoroughly disappointed with my decision to be with someone so heartless. It was out of pure fear and panic on my part and I did apologize later, after I found my dog, but she said \"Go fuck yourself\" and won't talk to me. AITA? Everyone is on my side except my sister, who says I'm a \"fucking prick\" because it's not my pregnant fiance's responsibility to \"chase around your fucking mutt\" and said she would have left immediately if her BF ever said what I did to her.", "created_utc": 1676825217, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116hk5c/aita_for_screaming_at_my_pregnant_fiance_for_not/", "score": 14798, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Considering this is a regular occurrence it makes you an irresponsible pet owner. Find the dog.

Yta before we even get to the point that this is a habit for the dog and not an emergency so this is all on you which is why your girlfriend is sick of getting dragged into searching for the dog. Get a gps dog tracker collar for goodness sake if you need to but also sort yourself out and train it properly.

She is tired of helping you chase down your dog that, by your own words, is getting out and running away constantly, of course she isn\u2019t going to be enthusiastic and happy to help every time. It\u2019s frustrating to any average person let alone someone dealing with hormones and sickness from literally being five months pregnant. You should not have gone so far as to call her a bitch and say you\u2019re essentially not happy to be with her all over your own dog and your own negligence of said dog.

YOU are responsible for keeping your dog confined. \n\nI have a neighbor like you - their dog gets out 2-3 times a week because they refuse to supervise.

Everyone stopped helping, animal control picked up the dog a few times so they had to pay a fee, and magically they figured out how to keep the dog from escaping. \n\nAlso know that it is very likely your dog will be struck and killed by a vehicle. The fact that you do nothing to stop this is alarming and shows an extreme lack of care about your dog. \n\nI\u2019d also be terrified that you\u2019ll do the same with your child.

You\u2019re endangering your dog. It sounds like you have made attempts to keep the dog in, which is great, but if the dog is still getting out once a week, you need to try harder. It\u2019s unfair to your fianc\u00e9 and your neighbors who might end up with unwanted dog waste or trampled plants on their property, and again, is dangerous for the dog. The dog shouldn\u2019t be left in the yard alone if the dog gets out that frequently. Many dogs get out occasionally but if it\u2019s more than once a month or two the dog really needs supervision and that\u2019s your responsibility. Think of it as practice for your baby. You\u2019re about to have a kid and if you turn your back on a young child for even a very short amount of time in a scenario where you know your child is around something that has been potentially dangerous in the past, your child could seriously harm themselves. Like, if you child keeps trying to touch the stovetop, you can\u2019t go answer the phone while the child is in the kitchen when the stove is on. If your kid gets severely burnt \u201cI was only gone for a second\u201d is not good enough. \n\nOn top of that, your fianc\u00e9 is at the stage where physical activity gets much harder. She shouldn\u2019t be running after a dog. Many people develop sciatica around 5-6 months. At 5 months, I couldn\u2019t even take the trash out. Your fianc\u00e9 had every right to refuse and you were very hurtful toward her at a time when she deserves compassion and respect for her boundaries. It also sounds like you don\u2019t really understand enough about the toll pregnancy takes on the body, and as the partner of a pregnant person, you should really take the time to read up and be informed.", "YTA.

I'm not saying my wife's concerns aren't valid, because they are. I'm simply not willing to re-home my dog (3yo Heeler). My MIL gave us the dog for free back 2 1/2 years ago and the behaviors have always been there. She gets in to the cat box constantly, she gets up on our table when we aren't looking, she growls at us for redirecting her every single time, she absolutely has bitten the back of my wife's leg when my wife was vacuuming or bitten my wife's hand when my wife went to take away something she wasn't supposed to have. So she's bitten twice over the time we have had her and both times were barely hard enough to draw blood (scratches that had tiny beads of blood). We brought her to the vet and we were told she has a hormonal imbalance, more than likely due to inbreeding (my MIL got her from a breeder in Kentucky so I guess its possible- as we know nothing about the people and were told there was easily 6 male dogs there to two females). She was put on meds and it didn't help the issue. More things are the fact that she runs off/jumps out of our vehicle when we aren't looking and takes off. She has broken through many leads and harnesses, one of them being meant for a large dog (80+lbs). She had jumped out of our vehicle when we stopped at a red light the other day and took off down the street (chewed through her dog seat belt and we didn't realize it). It took us over 4 hours to get her back in the vehicle and my wife missed her doctor's appointment as a result (she's pregnant).\r  \n\r  \nNow the issues were brought up heavy lately because my wife said, and I quote, \"I outright refuse to continue dealing with this when our baby arrives. You have 7 months to find a new trainer and correct her behaviors or the dog is gone.\" We have already been through trainers however and even the trainers have stated that this is likely an imbalance in chemicals, not behavioral. This was after 2 years (she was just taken from the training program 4 months ago). She can't be medicated due to other health related issues. But I'm also not willing to just give up on my dog. My wife on the other hand has no qualms rehoming her because of her being bitten and her simply being completely fed up with \"revolving her life around a dog when she has a baby on the way and no energy\" (missing her appointment and chasing the dog around for 4 hours truly made her resentful because it was the gender ultrasound that she had been looking forward to). I told her I wasn't getting rid of the dog and she immediately started packing her stuff. She's currently with her mother and has texted me and said that she will not be coming home until the dog is gone. I think it's just hormones but my friends have stated I'm an AH because I'm essentially choosing a \"annoying and aggressive\" dog over my wife and unborn child.", "YTA she is pregnant. As a man you\u2019ll never  understand. This is YOUR dog. YOU got distracted by a phone call. This is how accidents happen. YOU got distracted. Then when you didn\u2019t get help for finding your dog YET AGAIN you unleashed your anger on your pregnant wife. OP you are so in the wrong here.

He doesn't know he can - he thinks the fence is impregnable and can't be overcome.  I'm not going to let him in on the secret.  \n\nOnce a dog learns that fences can be overcome, it can be extremely difficult to keep them contained.  \n\nFrom one of my posts on /r dogtraining.  \n\n>I have a case about a Siberian in a containment arms race with his owner. The owner would improve the fence and the Sibe would see it as a puzzle to solve.  At one point the owner had created a Fort Knox level of fencing and after a couple weeks, his Sibe was escaping again. From video footage, the Sibe just seemed to disappear. By putting up cameras that were pointing towards the house, the owner saw how he was doing it: his Sibe got on patio table and sort of ricocheted off a pine tree trunk to get his front paws hooked on the edge of the garage roof gutter. He'd hoist himself on the roof, walk to the other side and jump down. That dog was a genius.\n\nSiberians are notorious for running for the sake of running. They don't hate their owners, they are not abused.  For collies, love and obedience are linked together.  For Sibes, love is independent of obedience.  A Sibe can dearly love his owner and happily take off for the sheer hell of it.  I've joke that they think their job is to teach their owner how to loosen up and have fun.  Fun for a Sibe isn't necessarily fun for their owner.", "I have no experience as a dog owner whatsoever, but the way OP describes it, it sounds like a game for the dog and he is absolutely enforcing a habit.

My childhood dog learned to brace against the zap and just ran through it every time. My parents just turned off the fencing eventually but kept the remote control and the collar on so if she did break off the lead we could zap her before she got to the highway. We used it a lot at first and her reaction was to stop and spin in a circle looking for the red flags that marked the electric fence but of course there weren't any four houses down. It did slow her down enough to catch her. God she was so damn fast.\n\nShe lived until 17 though, so despite the protests to the cruelty of it, I am absolutely certain she lived longer getting shocked a dozen or so times than she would have if she had made it out of the subdivision to the bordering highway (50-60mph and blind turns that left it littered with dead cats and deer and dogs for 3 of 4 seasons).", "Seriously, he couldn't have at least dropped her off at the doctor's appointment or called an Uber?

Live with the dog!", "Why can I see that he is going be out looking for his dog while his baby needs to be fed or diaper change if his Fiance ever leaves him alone with the baby and the dog. I know I\u2019m reaching here but damn I bet the lost dog will be the priority over his baby needs.", "yo what?? could you send me a link, I'm having a hard time finding it on Google. and yeah, imagine if that ultrasound revealed like devastating health information for mother and child.", "I never stressed when my 4 kids were running around making a racket but the moment it got quiet I'd get nervous and have to see what kind of trouble they were getting into. If op can't manage a medium sized dog he's in for a rough decade or two while this kid grows up", "He\u2019ll probably yell at the baby for not helping to look honestly", "She was ready for her run lol!", "Edited to include the link", "Yeah either that or it was dinner time hahahaha", "And it's like... He apologized, but he doesn't think he's wrong? The finac\u00e9e knows that means he'll just do it again next week.", "As a person, I prided myself with being so capable. My friends would call me when they moved. I could life heavy shit and my endurance was amazing. So when I got pregnant, I was floored when my energy went kaput. I would get winded when I showered. I couldn't do anything. And at the same time, I was so critical of myself, basically crawling, trying to do things as my husband told me to rest.  So reading this was terrible. I'm sure fiance is already in disbelief at how tired and nauseous she is, and her partner not only doesn't believe how hard it is, but expects her to chase after some dog 4x a week?!?!?", "Everyone knows when you're stressed and scared that the best way to cope is to verbally assault and denigrate your pregnant partner who's dealing with a hormonally imbalanced dog that (according to another post) has bitten her twice.  Right?  Right?..... \ud83d\udc40", "I'm so tired of people who get dogs before either researching the breed or who know what their dogs need but don't care enough to do anything about it \ud83d\ude43", "I honestly hope she does, dude can't even look after a dog he have for six years, can you imagine a kid??! He's gonna be type that is less work to raise the baby solo than look after the baby AND him. \n\n\nYTA", "You are right. There are so many solutions to this issue. Every week?  Fianc\u00e9e gets credit for helping out this long. And when the baby comes and the dog gets out will OP be mad that she chooses to stay w baby rather than go on yet another dog hunt??  YTA. Fix this problem", "And calling her names and attacking her character, that is not fighting fair. In fact that some major narcissist behavior, maybe YOU (OP) need some training! I hope she leaves him. He's definitely the AH!", "Why are you acting like that was hard to hear because you were pregnant? No, that was awful and he needs to get counseling. It doesn\u2019t matter what was going on the world. He used his words to hurt you at your most vulnerable state. \n\nBut he would have called you that, with or without the baby. If he doesn\u2019t get help, he will do that to your child. Do you want your child to grow up thinking it\u2019s okay for people who love them, to insult them, because they\u2019re stressed??", "I'm an extreme dog person and I think he should be exercising and supervising his dog properly and that it's not his fiancee's responsibility to run after an escape artist every week", "As a new parent, I second this.", "He's lying about everyone being on his side! Straight bullshit!!", "The ages are insane. I would expect this from a 17 year old, not a 30yo man. \n\nHe's not responsible enough for fatherhood.", "The hypocrisy of lashing out on an exhausted, pregnant woman who battles nausea daily, by calling her selfish and telling her she lacks empathy is mind boggling.  I agree, if my husband treated me this way when I was pregnant, I would have packed his things. He needs to learn to handle his dog, and his emotions before the baby comes.  Is she expected to load up a newborn to help him find the Houdini dog in a few months? Does  he expect she will leave the baby behind to help? Definitely a YTA situation.", "Yep, that kind of talk is a deal-breaker for me too. I don't care what kind of emotions brought it out. It's not okay. \n\nOP, YTA. You need some perspective and also to learn to calm down before you speak so that you don't verbally abuse your partner... or your future children.", "I\u2019d leave over this too. There are some things you can\u2019t come back from.", "Add to that the fact that *HE* projected on her and yelled that *she*, the one who\u2019s 5 months pregnant, lacks empathy\u2026 smh \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "TBH, I feel for the dog too.  Why is the dog constantly escaping?  Given that OP is this much of an AH to his fianc\u00e9e, I wonder how he treats the dog.   Either way, it's not really the dog's fault that OP hasn't bothered to train them properly or give them enough attention/exercise.  I wouldn't want to live with OP either.", "Agreed. I have never called anyone a slur or a curse word when upset at them, even when I'm so upset to the point of seeing red. I still try to use my words and be respectful to them, because I care about them and you can never take that back.\n\nIf you call someone a b*tch when you're angry/upset/drunk, etc, then you meant it when you were calm/sober, too. And if you didn't mean it at all then you should never have said it. You can't take that back and you can't unsay it.", "Yelling was unleashed, which (through no fault of my own) caused my pregnant wife to be called a heartless bitch.", "Heck, why hasn't the guy bought a tracker? Our dog had a high prey drive where if we didn't spot a deer or pheasant before him, he was off. Bought the tracker as a just in case and had to use it once. \n\nFor anyone wondering, it was a tractive tracker and worth its weight for the cost.", "But if he can't even keep watch on his dog, how is he going to take care of a baby? Those things have an actual death wish lmao", "That, and also a GPS tag needs to be put on the dog\u2019s collar. This way if the dog runs away again, Op could track it down quickly.", "Absolutely, we rescued a heeler mix and walk her twice a day for an hour each plus play in the yard and also do trick training. They need so much attention if they are not actually \"working\" that it is like having a kid, I can't imagine the neglect that dog will suffer once the baby arrives.", "The dog needs rehomed or, at worst put down. The dog is a danger to the baby at this point. If it bit his wife it\u2019s going to bite their child. My dad was a cosmetic surgeon for 30 years and was an on call specialist for 10 minimum. Usually children get bit on the face or hands and without a cosmetic surgeon involved scarring is likely. A child and a dog usually don\u2019t mix well when a dog is instigated (most of the cases my dad dealt with were a child messing with a dog\u2019s food, body or toys) and since this dog is inherently unpredictable this makes it especially unsafe to have around a child. Especially since the imbalance sounds unmanageable with treatment of any kind there\u2019s no other alternative than to rehome the dog or, if it\u2019s not possible the worst case scenario is to put it down.", "Actually, the people on his side know nothing about dogs and how much stimulation and exercise a working dog needs. I feel sorry for the dog who is obviously not having his needs met.", "Wow even when my dog gets out it usually takes 10 minutes tops", "We had a healer mix that needed lots of exercise. My dad would pop on roller skates and run the dog that way. It kept them both in shape. No way would he keep a dog with chemical imbalances around a baby!", "My thought too! It's really sad because when this dog does inevitably bite the kid, it will likely result in euthanasia. Right now this dog has a chance of a decent life if rehomed into an experienced household -- I've seen worse dogs than this rehabilitated into very happy loving dogs. But the dog in the second post (that may or may not be OP) is clearly an unhappy dog in an unhappy home that is on it's way to death row if that dog's owner doesn't get it together. Honestly just sad overall.", "Agreed. The kinder thing to do for this dog is to let her go. If she has been to training and nothing has changed and she can\u2019t be on meds that could help, you need to send this dog to the bridge.\n\nOn a side note - if the dog had come from a responsible breeder and not what likely was a puppy mill breeder, you would be getting a dog from someone who gives a shit about their dogs and how the puppies temperament would turn out", "Ah, so they're either just AHs like him or he's not giving them the full, truthful story. Yea, I feel bad for the dog too, the poor thing just has a crappy owner.", "Oh for fuck sakes is this the one who doesn\u2019t think the dog will bite the baby? That dog was only 3 if I remember correctly so either same poster changing the story to get an answer he wants or there are 2 people that dumb", "I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same poster trying to get reddit to agree with him.\n\nSurprise! We still don't. The dog has already bitten his fianc\u00e9e twice, it will definitely bite the baby.", "Tie downs exist for a reason", "And put an apple air tag on the dog or something as well that incase it happens again after fixing the fence and leasing it that if it gets out again that it is easier to find", "I'd say he has more like 0-2 months. Baby could be up to a month early. And I'd say to give at least a month to re-home the dog. Could easily take longer since the dog is poorly trained and runs off all the time, which are problems many potential new owners may not want to deal with. In fact, he should probably be trying to re-home the dog like yesterday.", "> Everyone is on my side except my sister, who says I'm a \"fucking prick\" because it's not my pregnant fiance's responsibility to \"chase around your fucking mutt\" and said she would have left immediately if her BF ever said what I did to her.\n\nFucking lol. Either \"everyone\" doesn't actually mean everyone or OP is lying through his teeth when he's told his version of events to other people, and only his sister saw through the bullshit (or some combination of both).\n\nOP, be a fucking adult and train your dog, and get on down your knees and beg your partner for forgiveness.", "My job involves walking streets often, and one of the people who lives there is a woman who is older and not physically active who lives alone. One day she decided to go out and get a husky. I was talking to her about it and she said she'd never had a dog before and seemed surprised when I said it was gonna be a handful of a breed especially for a beginner. The inside of that house is all sorts of fucked up now lol. That poor pup.", "Probably has too much gap between the fence top and the roller. If the dog can fit under it, a roller is just a nice spot to pause for a scratch mid escape."]}
