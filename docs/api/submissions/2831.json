Everything else is just gross.", "NTA you are not on the lease, she illegally rents a part of the flat to you. She behaves like a pig and you have to deal with it? No, not really. You told her you can't handle this behaviour (stealing your meds, your car, having sex in public rooms, left things to rot) and like it sound, you got no seperate contract with her. Go on and let her suffer from her mistakes", "In your position, I would say NTA. \n\nWho knows what she would have done if you had given her notice.", "No lease, NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA - since it\u2019s her name on the lease it was on her to give you a sub lease. She didn\u2019t, no lease, no payments. Also you did try to talk to her, she didn\u2019t make any changes. If you had given her notice who knows what she would have done.", "Absolutely NTA. If I had a roommate leaving dirty dishes until mold grew on them, I'd be out of there right away.", "NTA - a few reasons..\nYou\u2019ve discussed the behavior with her for long enough. She ignored you.\nWithout your name on lease, she willfully accepted the risk of being in this position. Legally you were monthly tenant at will, and her inability to stay without you isn\u2019t your fault.\nBesides that, her behavior itself is just gross - not sure how she expected you\u2019d just live with it.", "NTA. Tell her she is lucky you didn\u2019t report her to  the police for stealing your car.", " NTA \n\nShe took your car without permission and took your Rx meds. \n\nYou should have reported her to the police, THEN dipped out without warning. \n\nAgain, NTA.", "NTA. Everyone pointing out that telling her you were moving out ahead of time would have resulted in even more shady behavior is right. Depending on where you live, you'd be considered a month-to-month tenant & legally would be obligated to 30 days notice. So, at most you're obligated to pay one more month of rent. I doubt she'll bother going to court for one month's rent & given your story, I'm not sure she'd win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, how was she managing the rent before you moved in? If she signed a lease that she can't possibly cover for a single month without a roommate, that's her problem. She's lying about getting kicked out. If she has a lease, it would take months to go through eviction court. Most landlords will accommodate you for a month or two, if you have a financial crisis that prevents you from making a full rent payment. Again- not your problem.", "NTA You do not owe her anything.\n\n>She just texted me though and said that she wasn't going to make rent this month and might get kicked out because of me\n\nThis is just an attempt to manipulate you, don't fall for it.

If she were serious about keeping a roommate, she would have paid more attention to your warnings.", "This is exactly the reason people rent rooms and pay month to month, so you can bounce whenever you want.  If you weren't friends, or didn't become friends, then why even care if YTA?  That said it was a little cowardly for you to disappear like that, but if you were expecting a confrontation, and you'd already expressed discontent, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  Hopefully you don't frequent the same establishments, cause this sounds like a bar fight waiting to happen.", "NTA.  She stole your car, I would have had her arrested.  She stole your 'script. Again I would have filed a report.  She's lucky all you did was move out.", "NTA mainly based on the fact that she did things like take your car without permission and at least once stole your medication.  With a normal roommate you should give them thirty days but she proved she was willing to lie and steal from you so bouncing was the best way to protect you and your belongings", "NTA Stealing your car, stealing your meds, growing plate mold. Any sane person would be running out of there. You owe her nothing for her illegal sub let.", "NTA you had every right to leave. She literally stole your car! And she stole your medication, you should\u2019ve reported her to the police! She\u2019s been an awful roommate. You should report to the landlord that she was illegally renting to other people because the landlord deserves to know what she\u2019s really doing.", "NTA. Stealing your stuff?

I can\u2019t imagine what kind of pigsty will form in the apartment if she brings in an equally horrible roommate.\n\nI agree to a certain extent that OP could have notified the roommate, but I also feel that this would have caused a possibly dangerous, but definitely explosive argument. The roommate was spoken to frequently about her behavior, she made zero effort to relate to OP\u2019s concerns. On top of that, she\u2019s a creep for sending unsolicited nudes. \n\nUltimately, if the roommate wants housing security, then she needs to work on herself to prevent roommates from running.

No one should have to suffer like that.", "My mindset is a landlord has an obligation to provide livable premises in order to charge rent.
