She asked for something, was told she wouldn\u2019t get it because he didn\u2019t want to give it.\n\nNowhere does she demand he make pancakes, but she doesn\u2019t want anything else.", "okay, you're being obtuse which... probably should've clocked from your whole deluge of other comments but. i'll bite.\n\nplease explain to me how twenty minutes in the kitchen mixing flour, eggs, milk, and baking powder before putting it on a stove is MORE effort than the gas money to go to and from a restaurant to delivery lukewarm, soggy pancakes.", "What a small man OP is", "Oh, I dated a man like that. I still feel uncomfortable wearing dresses and shorts. That's probably going to stick with her a while.\n\nAnd he thought she looked amazing?? Use your damn words. Poor woman.", "Jesus. Like...what could you possibly get out of being such a low little ahole to someone you are supposed to love and cherish?", "I\u2019m not a great cook, and I\u2019v never had takeout be less appetizing than myself making the same dish, except maybe steak because I know how I like my steak cooked and do it my way", "You mean pancakes that are gonna be sitting there getting soggy until he picks them up and then by the time he gets home soggy and lukewarm? Yeah no thanks. It takes literally no fucking effort to mix some flour eggs sugar baking soda and pour onto a pan. A grown ass adult should learn basic cooking skills", "yeah you\u2019re not getting it at all. it\u2019s about the effort, if a grown ass man can\u2019t mix a few ingredients and pour it in a pan and cook it then my god there\u2019s no hope for any of us.", "I cook for my partner too! But she would be thrilled at me offering to go get her food instead of eating my subpar food for a change lol", "Why would u want something that tastes worse specifically because your partner made it? Seems overly sentimental and very illogical. I\u2019d prefer the foot that tastes better\u2026unless my partner was excited for me to try their cooking in which case I\u2019d of course want their food that they were happy to make", "Saying \u201cthis is what I want and I will accept no compromise\u201d is demanding. Saying that she doesn\u2019t want anything if he can\u2019t maker her pancakes himself IS effectively demanding it", "As someone who likes driving and doesn\u2019t enjoy cooking tutorials, it would certainly be less mental effort for me. \n\nI don\u2019t eat pancakes, so I didn\u2019t consider the importance of them being eaten shortly after being made. Given that, it\u2019s probably reasonable enough to not be happy with pancakes from a restaurant that have been sitting out for 15 minutes by the time they get homr. I can accept the logic of that and be at peace with my initial ignorance.", "Shrimp energy! I learned that today in one of these threads.", "He sounds like a weasel. That could be his nickname.  \n\n\nShe should dump him. I doubt it would be hard for her to find an upgrade in the 'man' department. The dude can't even make fucking pancakes for chrissakes. His idea of cooking meat is probably boiling a hot dog on the stove.", "If you can flip a steak you can flip a pancake", "thank you! if my 18 year old brother who is still learning to cook can make pancakes from scratch so can a grown ass adult. cooking is a life skill that everyone should know", "Effort for the sake of effort is a nice sentiment, but shouldn\u2019t be expected. If my partner went through extra steps to do something herself for me, that\u2019d be nice. But if she took the easy route that still suffices, I would be just as happy because im not entitled.", "You know how hard it is to make pancakes? \nMixing few powders and liquids and putting them in pan? \nThat's impossible task \n\nGetting a divorce is way easier \nThen no more need for making pancakes \nJust have to live on takeouts", "OP\u2019s burner account?", "I value the time and effort my partner gives me when cooking for me even when it's sometimes just edible. Delivery and takeout are just as appreciated!", "Because sentimentality is important to a lot of people? It\u2019s like when your kid makes a craft for you at school or draws something, yeah it looks shitty but it means a lot to you because they were excited to do it for you. Her partner SHOULD be excited to try to do this for her.", "it's also, again - back to effort. \n\nlike... okay, you don't want someone going to extensive efforts for you - which is your own choice, though i feel that's sad and still want to tell you that you're worth somebody showing you effort and appreciation. but i would think for a majority of people? it's not much to ask for someone to go an inch out of their daily routine to do something for a person if they care about that person. and in fact some people *enjoy* doing that for the person they care about.\n\nwhether that's \"hey i stopped by the gas station and got you a candy bar\" or \"took care of the dishes even though it was your turn to do them\" or \"here's a meal i learned how to make because you said you wanted it\". doesn't matter. if someone said to me, personally, that they chose minimal mental effort over being nice for me on any day to say nothing of my birthday? that's hurtful. that's saying that i'm not worth that twenty minutes of effort. \n\njust. the bar is literally on the ground and this dude is still trying to kick it down the road.", "I might appreciate effort for the sake of effort, but it would never be an *expectation* of mine, see the difference?", "I think I\u2019m just less sentimental than most. I go out and get coffee for my partner unprompted some Saturdays before she gets up. She usually cries because we don\u2019t *expect* extra effort and really do appreciate when it\u2019s given.\n\nI think where I\u2019m hung up is the *expectation* of extra effort, and being upset at a compromise. It\u2019s just my mentality of expecting nothing and appreciating everything."]}
