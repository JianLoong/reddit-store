I (31F) have since found a partner I love. We have a baby together and are getting married next year. I've been missing my mum a lot throughout this - she would be a wonderful grandmother.\n\n\r  \nOne of my mum's friends, 'Lauren', recently got in touch. She had heard about my upcoming wedding. She claimed that whilst unwell in the months leading up to her death, my mum had told Lauren that she should take me wedding dress shopping on her behalf if I ever got married one day. Lauren said she was excited to do this. She also expressed looking forward to helping with my wedding decorations, flowers etc. \n\n\r  \nThere's one problem: I can't STAND Lauren. I have always found her overbearing and rude to the point of dreading gatherings where she will be present (she and her husband remain in my dad's friendship group so attend parties that he hosts). Lauren has made unpleasant remarks about my weight. She was recently bossy and critical of my parenting when I ran into her at my dad's Christmas party ('How come you're supplementing and not fully breastfeeding?' 'Why are you going to put your daughter in nursery when a childminder would be better?' etc). There have been many other examples. I have always responded to such comments in a polite manner and not engaged further, but I don't like it. (I tend to become a doormat when upset out of fear of losing my temper - my fault for enabling rudeness to me, I realise!)\n\n\r  \nEven if I liked Lauren more, I still wouldn't want her involved with my wedding. Dress-shopping feels like a very personal thing to me and I had planned to do it with my future SIL, who I like and trust. In fact, I don't want Lauren at my wedding at all. She was far from my mum's closest friend and I had planned to only invite my mum's childhood best friend and a couple of others who my dad is close to in order to keep him company. My wedding is going to be smallish and simple. I'm a shy person and already dreading the attention - the thought of someone there who I know will be judgemental of me makes it feel so much worse. Lauren and I have never been close and she has never even contacted me before today so I'm amazed she thinks she would be involved in any way.\n\n\r  \nI want to:\r  \n1)\tTell Lauren, politely, that I won't be dress-shopping with her and have other arrangements in hand for the decorations and flowers.\n\nand\r  \n2)\tNot invite Lauren to my wedding.\n\n\r  \nMy dad, whilst supportive of me overall, thinks it would be too harsh of me not to find at least some way to include her. He pointed out that Lauren suffered a bereavement in her own family recently so is in a bad place. He added that whilst we don't know for sure if she's telling the truth about my mum's 'wish' (mum didn't mention it to either of us), if it is true, it would be good to honour it.\n\n\r  \nWIBTA for not inviting Lauren to my wedding or accepting any help from her with dress-shopping and flowers?\r", "created_utc": 1703165117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nmz38/wibta_if_i_refused_to_let_my_dead_mums_friend/", "score": 885, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is also likely to disappoint Lauren and hurt her feelings at a time when she has recently suffered a bereavement herself. However, I don't want to include her because I'm not close to her personally, I don't think she was really all that close to my mum, and I find her intimidating and rude.

The good part about it being your wedding is that you get to pick who is involved and who is not.\n\nIf you knew for sure what your mum had said to Lauren was true, then I can see how it might be a consideration, but as you have no idea she might just be making it up as a way of inserting herself into the wedding.

You want a wedding that you can remember fondly, and from what you've described, that's one without Lauren.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Wedding dress shopping or anything else in regards to your wedding is both you and your future husband\u2019s choice.

NO NO I insist I will step in blah blah blah* - she seems the type. \n\nJust tell her no. Or, if your dad is worried that will upset her, tell him to tell her no. It will undoubtedly upset her, but you can't help that. If your mother mother had any such concerns, it was for you to have love and support on your wedding day. If Lauren does not spark joy, Lauren don't get to be there.", "YWNBTA\n\nSimply go about your life and your wedding plans without this woman and do your thing.

If she's part of your dad's group, it's rough to cut his group down at a time he may be needing people to go out and meet/be with people. My own dad has been horribly lonely since my  mother passed. So, I'd encourage you to maintain a front for his sake.", "nta. tell your dad you're not Lauren's emotional support animal and tell her NO, thanks for the offer but everything is already taken care of.  buhbye", "NTA, and there are graceful ways to tell her.\n\n\u201cLauren, I so appreciate you reaching out and wanting to fulfill this promise to my mom. I\u2019m sure you brought her a lot of comfort in her passing. My mom and her memory matters so much to me and it means a lot to know that she had such good friends who still remember her with love. I appreciate that my mom was worried I\u2019d have to go dress shopping without close family and friends who I trust and that you were there to alleviate that worry. In the years since my mother passed, I\u2019ve been privileged enough to become close with new family in a way I do not think she ever foresaw or anticipated. In many ways, these relationships are inspired by the close friendships I was lucky enough to witness my mom had with people such as yourself. I\u2019m at a stage where I now have family in my life who are prepared to take me dress shopping and I have already made plans to do so. I\u2019ve also made plans to honor my mom in the process. I\u2019m sure this makes you happy to hear, I know it would have made my mom happy to hear.  So while I very much appreciate your kind offer and the comfort you brought to my mom, it is no longer necessary for you to extend yourself in the way my mom likely believed it would be necessary prior to her passing. I thank you so much for reaching out and being willing to do this if I had needed it. It means a lot to myself and my dad.\u201d\n\nWith the wedding itself, I\u2019d talk to your dad about how he wants to handle his friendships. She shouldn\u2019t be there, and it\u2019s likely more about helping him navigate any fallout if some of his friend circle is invited and others aren\u2019t. Perhaps he explains to his friends that you\u2019re having a small wedding, perhaps he throws you a seperate party at his house for his friends and you agree to attend that (only if you are open to that), perhaps he wants you to do the explaining, or perhaps he doesn\u2019t want to comment at all. Talk to him, but be firm that you do not want her at the wedding or other important events you are planning. Ask him to give you suggestions about appropriate ways to \u201cinclude\u201d her that do not take away from your experience. \n\nThis really can be something as simple as you saying to a group, \u201cI\u2019m having a very small wedding and unfortunately am unable to invite all of my parent\u2019s close friends and extended family. I\u2019d like to include photos of mom with all of her friends, however. I know how much you all meant to her. If you\u2019re willing to share some favorite photos with my mom, I\u2019d deeply appreciate it. Thank you for what you\u2019re doing to help make my day special.\u201d \n\nThen, if she does share, write her a thank you note and tell her how much you appreciated and used a photo and how much it would have meant to your mom to know she still thinks of her.", "You are not obligated to be friends with her just because she was friends with your mother.\n\nIt's your wedding, not hers.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for whatever is going on with Lauren and hope she finds peace, but what she did is one of the most manipulative things I have ever heard.\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty for deciding not use your wedding as Lauren\u2019s therapy session.", "NTA - you are not remotely TAH.

She claimed that whilst unwell in the months leading up to her death, my mum had told Lauren that she should take me wedding dress shopping on her behalf if I ever got married one day. Lauren said she was excited to do this. She also expressed looking forward to helping with my wedding decorations, flowers etc. \n\n\r  \nThere's one problem: I can't STAND Lauren. I have always found her overbearing and rude to the point of dreading gatherings where she will be present (she and her husband remain in my dad's friendship group so attend parties that he hosts). Lauren has made unpleasant remarks about my weight. She was recently bossy and critical of my parenting when I ran into her at my dad's Christmas party ('How come you're supplementing and not fully breastfeeding?' 'Why are you going to put your daughter in nursery when a childminder would be better?' etc). There have been many other examples. I have always responded to such comments in a polite manner and not engaged further, but I don't like it. (I tend to become a doormat when upset out of fear of losing my temper - my fault for enabling rudeness to me, I realise!)\n\n\r  \nEven if I liked Lauren more, I still wouldn't want her involved with my wedding. Dress-shopping feels like a very personal thing to me and I had planned to do it with my future SIL, who I like and trust. In fact, I don't want Lauren at my wedding at all. She was far from my mum's closest friend and I had planned to only invite my mum's childhood best friend and a couple of others who my dad is close to in order to keep him company. My wedding is going to be smallish and simple. I'm a shy person and already dreading the attention - the thought of someone there who I know will be judgemental of me makes it feel so much worse. Lauren and I have never been close and she has never even contacted me before today so I'm amazed she thinks she would be involved in any way.\n\n\r  \nI want to:\r  \n1)\tTell Lauren, politely, that I won't be dress-shopping with her and have other arrangements in hand for the decorations and flowers.\n\nand\r  \n2)\tNot invite Lauren to my wedding.\n\n\r  \nMy dad, whilst supportive of me overall, thinks it would be too harsh of me not to find at least some way to include her. He pointed out that Lauren suffered a bereavement in her own family recently so is in a bad place. He added that whilst we don't know for sure if she's telling the truth about my mum's 'wish' (mum didn't mention it to either of us), if it is true, it would be good to honour it.\n\n\r  \nWIBTA for not inviting Lauren to my wedding or accepting any help from her with dress-shopping and flowers?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are not Laruen's family and, while it is sad that she has suffered a loss, that does not give her the right to impose upon your wedding. I think the gracious thing would be to make her a guest, but that will be her only role.", "NTA - maybe I\u2019m just blunt and witchcy, but I would tell her that those things are being reserved for those closest to you, and that, while she was friends with your mother, she is not close to you. I would also flat out say that your wedding will be small and only include the people you and your fianc\u00e9 are close too, so you hope she will understand not getting an invitation.\n\nBut I tend towards too blunt so YMMV", "Next time she mentions it, tell her you already picked one and show her a picture of something you like, then when you show up in a different dress, you can tell her that you had to change it, the store screwed up and couldn't get it in time", "NTA - she wasn't your mother closest friend and so was unlikely to have been asked to take her place. Yes, you don't know for sure but if it makes you uncomfortable, then err on the side that makes you happy. There is an equally good chance that Lauren wants to shoe-horn herself into any big event going and is using your mother's sad loss to do so.\n\nJust thank her but explain you are moving forward into a new life with your inlaws to be and everything is already under control. The fact she has had a bereavement is neither here or there - if it was a loss of a daughter, then you are in for a world of pain as Lauren makes your day all about her loss. If otherwise, then it is better to concentrate on supporting her own family rather than distracting herself by interfering where she is not needed or wanted. If she is fragile and continues her usual style of communication, you are likely to snap at some point. So don't take that risk.", "NTA. Even if Lauren has the best of intentions, you are not obligated to include someone that you don't like and don't have a relationship with in your wedding. Honestly, it kind of sounds like she would be an absolute nightmare to deal with also. Definitely stand your ground and protect your peace.", "NTA. You don't have to but for the sake of compromise, you can invite her to the wedding. But don't include her in the wedding.", "NTA - but you need to be direct with Lauren, otherwise she will keep badgering.\n\nThanks Lauren for the very generous offer, I am missing my Mom as I navigate these milestones.  However, I prefer to honor her in my own way and I don't want a stand in for my Mom, that would make me miss her even more. \n\nNo need to say more, do not defend your decision (this gives her room for a comeback and to dismiss it), do not tell her your SIL will be coming with you (again, she can argue why she is a better choice).\n\nEven if this is true (which I doubt, as  wouldn't your mother have talked to you about it), you have no need to honor it.  Even if you Mom was still alive, she does not get to direct who is involved in your wedding planning.\n\nDon't invite Lauren, don't tell her ahead of time that she isn't invited.

I hope that you have a happy holiday!\u201d \n\nIf she tries to \u2018assist\u2019 with anything else\u2026it\u2019s already being handled *wink*wink*. If she attempts to bring your Mom into this, you can let her know that you weren\u2019t aware of the promise but everything is taken care of. The point is whatever her response is, everything is being taken care of by someone else that isn\u2019t her. \n\nAs for wedding invites, I would hope that she understands either (a) when reading your message in response, most people would assume a lack of details and involvement mean there is a STRONG chance you aren\u2019t being invited. (B) she\u2019ll figure it out when she doesn\u2019t receive an invite. \n\nYou can always tell her that you\u2019re planning to keep it small and limited to close friends and family, as she is neither hopefully she\u2019ll get the point after that. If she continues to be obtuse you can kindly let her know \u201cI know that you and my Mom shared a very close relationship, unfortunately I can\u2019t say the same about you and I. We are limiting our guest list to close friends and family only and you won\u2019t be receiving an invitation, but if you would like to celebrate at a later date I\u2019m sure that we could arrange something.\u201d \n\nPS: My mother tells me that I can be very brash so if the messages above are toooooo much please feel free to soften the language. You do need to accept that her feelings will be hurt and it is not your job to manage her feelings. The fact is you two don\u2019t share a relationship with each other and going dress shopping with someone you actively dislike and aren\u2019t close to isn\u2019t appealing at all.", "NTA. Stand your ground. I feel like this is Lauren trying to insert herself into your wedding because she either 1) has ruined the relationship to be involved with her daughter/DIL wedding 2) has no children to do this to and you're an easy target 3) she wants a redo of her wedding at your expense/wants bragging rights \n\nJust tell her \"thank you for the offer but I will pass\" but if she keeps pushing then don't be afraid to be harsh.

Repeat as necessary, without varying tone or inflection if she starts getting pushy.", "NTA. I'm sorry you lost your mom. Now is your opportunity to lose Lauren as well.

I've got everything under control, and I'm not inviting anyone other than my SIL dress shopping. Thank you for understanding.'\n\nMight be a bit too blunt for some, but I wouldn't give her an inch. If she argues it's what your mum wanted, kindly remind her that might be so, but it's not what you want, and your mum would understand and respect that.\n\nWhile Lauren has recently lost a loved one, it's not up to you to make her feel better by including her in any way in something so big and important in your life.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m also sorry that your father is pushing this. Lauren is simply reaping the consequences of her behavior.  Why is he putting someone who criticizes your body over your feelings?  I would politely and gently but firmly put your foot down on this, and if your dad or Lauren keep bringing it up tell them you\u2019ve made your decision and you\u2019re not willing to discuss it any further than you already have.  Lauren\u2019s bereavement has nothing to do with you. You can be sorry for her loss without the need to tiptoe and accommodate an adult\u2019s  feelings who has been so rude to you.

Don't be surprised if she doesn't clap back.  You need to practice this and maybe have your SIL there in case it gets to be too much and if she is assertive than you let her take over the call.

Lauren said she was excited to do this. She also expressed looking forward to helping with my wedding decorations, flowers etc.*\n\nSounds like Lauren is trying to claim this, to manipulate you with some of the top manipulations that manipulators use:  guilt, and obligation.  And, **she's doing what a lot of abusive people do:  using a time when you might be vulnerable,** because of your mom not being there, **to get what she wants from you, to put herself in control.**\n\nSounds like Lauren wants to play mom, get the attention and be in control over your wedding.  Sounds like she's claiming something that never happened, to get your compliance.  Even if your mom and Lauren talked about things your mom would miss, doesn't mean that Lauren's view of that conversation is correct.  \n\n**All this manipulation is a really good reason to not talk to her** about any of this again.\n\n\r\r*There's one problem: I can't STAND Lauren...overbearing and rude to the point of dreading gatherings where she will be present...has made unpleasant remarks about my weight... bossy and critical...many other examples.*\n\nAll this**, a pattern of Lauren's bad behavior and nastiness, is just another reason to not have her involved** in your wedding or wedding prep, or your life,  in any possible way.\n\n\r\r*I had planned to do it with my future SIL, who I like and trust. In fact, I don't want Lauren at my wedding at all.*\n\nThis is reasonable.  SIL is someone you trust.  Trying on dresses, you want someone you can trust, that you know won't be cruel or mean to you.  \n\n *She was far from my mum's closest friend and I had planned to only invite my mum's childhood best friend and a couple of others who my dad is close to in order to keep him company.* \n\nReasonable.  **Do not put this woman on your guest list, not after what she's trying to do to you.**  This behavior of hers is just cruel, and when added to the history you have with her mistreating you, **she's a person to avoid, not invite.**  Frankly, your dad doesn't need his friend group at your wedding.  The wedding isn't about his guests, it's about the people you want there to celebrate your joy with you.  He can talk to all the relatives, and meet new people.  And spend time with his friends the next day.\n\n\r*I want to:\r   Tell Lauren, politely, that I won't be dress-shopping with her and have other arrangements in hand for the decorations and flowers.*\n\nWith people like her, don't even bother.  If you contact her to tell her 'no', she's going to use that call to try to force your compliance, insult you, and hurt you more.   **She never should have approached you like this in the first place.   People like her will lie about things like this, expecting you to believe them.**  My MILFH did things like this to people.  \n\nThe safest and healthiest response to such people is not to respond at all.  If you see her sometime, and she mentions it, just say \"Thank you for your offer, but I have other plans.\"  I'd block her, to avoid more contact with her.   She's not your friend.\n\nShe's not trying to help you, she's trying to manipulate you and get control over you.  She's pretending it's help, to manipulate your compliance.  It's not help, when you don't want it.\r  \n\r  \n*My dad, whilst supportive of me overall, thinks it would be too harsh of me not to find at least some way to include her.* \n\nIt's not harsh to not include her.  She's not your friend.  She's a history of being cruel to you, in small ways.  She's being very manipulative in trying to get your compliance to her wants for involvement in your planning, which isn't her business at all.  **This is a woman to protect yourself from, not to include.**  \n\n*He pointed out that Lauren suffered a bereavement in her own family recently so is in a bad place.* \n\nBut that's not your responsibility.

As you mentioned you find her intimidating, rude and overbearing Lauren probably told your mom oh don\u2019t worry I\u2019ll be there for \u201cOP\u201d during the big moments in your honor while your mom just listened politely. \nSo definitely NTA. You don\u2019t have to explain why you don\u2019t want her there or her help it is your wedding and ultimately your life.", "NTA\n\nshe is lying about mums wish.\n\nyou should tell her politely she isn\u2019t invited to go dress shopping with you or help with your wedding, if she argues about it, tell her again NOT politely.\n\nDon\u2018t invite her to the wedding if you don\u2019t want to. \n\nI suspect Lauren is making up these stories because she knows you don\u2019t like her and won\u2019t be invited. \n\nyou are not being harsh to leave someone that you don\u2019t out of the organisation and the invites.  Work on not being a doormat, if you lose your temper and say mean things, it will definitely get the messages over loud and clear.", "You wouldn't be TA here, but you should expect that you won't have any kind of relationship with her after this.  If that doesn't bother you then go for it.", "> He pointed out that Lauren suffered a bereavement in her own family recently so is in a bad place\n\nYou aren't her emotional support human, nor should your wedding be used to be that for her. NTA", "NTA don't do this because she says it was a dieing wish. I had to deal with a woman who claimed to be my mom's best friend. For ever after my mom's death because she was \"stepping up\" for us. Just politely tell her you already made plans for everything but you really appreciate the offer. And thank her for thinking of you. It's better to make it clear right away your not interested, then doing it for their benefit.", "NTA.\n\nDoes your Dad know of your feelings towards Lauren? Because if he does, it's out of line to ask you to include her. If not, please tell him your feelings, and then let him know she won't be part of anything to do with your wedding, including attending.\n\nHer having a loss in her life is sad, but it's not your problem to manage her emotions by letting her take over your day.", "Wow, what a fantastic phrase!", "That's a great saying, but given the country's history, it has other implications.", "As a big LotR fan, I adore this. So much.", ">Then block/ignore all other messages. Don\u2019t engage, encourage or apologise. Don\u2019t get tangled with justifications or debate. Ignore.\n\nThis! And if she tries to ambush you, don't be shy in confronting her and telling her \"You must've forgot what I've told you. You're not included in this!\"\n\nMaybe also be careful and put some people on a info diet, don't share details pertaining your wedding and where you will buy your dress etc. If she somehow gets a hold of info that she shouldn't and shows up somewhere uninvited, don't feel bad to kick her out\n\nWhat's gonna happen, anyway? Laure will **shun** you?! Oh dear looorrd", "Was she though? Even OP didn't know, it was just Lauren claiming such things.\n\nI'd say politely tell her you already have plans, but thank you for thinking of you and your mother, and then disengage.\n\nAlso block if needed.", "Also, I wouldn't give her any info on the day, time and place your going dress shopping. I wouldn't put it past her to just show up. I wouldn't give your Dad the info either because he may just tell her.", "I agree - don't lie. Because if that gets uncovered, there'll be a host of other problems. I recommend something very factual, along these lines (which can also serve as \"talking points\", to be reiterated ad nauseam in different wordings should you run into her and she insists on discussing: \n\n1. \"My mom never mentioned this suggestion to me.\" (*Read: (a) The discussion can't have been that important, if it took place at all; (b) confirms your absolute right to have plans without her*).\n\n2. \"I'll be doing dress shopping, flowers, decor and all other prep work and planning with my future in-laws and my bridal party. It's all in hand!\"  (*Read: There's no role for you.*)\n\n3. \"The wedding will be very small and intimate, and include only family and a small handful of my and my husband's closest friends.\" (*Read: Don't expect an invitation because (a) numbers and (b) you don't meet any of these criteria*.)\n\nIf she tries to corral you into an argument, rinse and repeat. Good luck, and may your wedding be awesome!", "You can respect someone\u2019s intentions, even if you you don\u2019t follow their exact words. \n\nIF your mom asked Lauren to help you, she probably did it to ensure you would have someone there to support you and give you \u201cmotherly\u201d advice. But Lauren\u2019s not that person for you, SIL is.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t imagine your mother would want your experience and memories of your wedding/planning to be negative.", "No - you love and respect you Mom, but you would have absolutely no obligation to show that respect in connection with decisions she had no right to make on your behalf, let alone without your consent.", "I agree in general about not apologizing when not at fault. But while \"sorry\" is an apology, it has a secondary function in a lot of places as a social easing of a statement. In a breezy, upbeat response like the one in the above comment, it means \"I acknowledge this has the potential to upset you, so I'm quickly expressing sympathy to move the convo along.\" It can also be used to soften a statement when someone struggles to say no, to make it easier for them to say it. Leaving it off could come across as abrupt and change the tone from \"oh, no problem, I'm sure you'll be fine with this response\" to \"I'm annoyed with you and want you to go away.\" While the second option might be true, the first option is more likely to result in her laying off", "I totally agree about the \"sorry\" when there is no apology to be given.  There are many words that are soothing and kind without using \"sorry.\"\n\n\"I do appreciate your offer, and thank you for it, however I must and am declining because I've already made all my plans, including wedding dress shopping.   Do you know how you've made me happy?  Just showing your fondness for Mom and expressing your well wishes for me.  For that, you've given me the only wedding gift I need.  Thank you!\"", "I don't disagree, but some people see sorry (and I think a conversation like this can be best as text, because it doesn't allow for interruptions and or for the other party to just speak over OP) and see a crack to stick a lever into.\n\nOh don't feel sorry. I wouldn't want you to feel bad on my account. I'll come over right now to go over the plans.", "That also makes sense. I tend to go with \"oh, don't worry about it!\" or something similar for that reason. But also I've worked through my own process of using \"sorry\" to make it easier for me to manage to say no. \n\nI also like using \"sorry for the confusion!\" with customers, because then they hear sorry and think I'm apologizing, and don't notice that what I actually mean is \"I'm sorry for myself that I've just had to deal with you being confused about my very simple instructions.\" Sorry has so many uses"]}
