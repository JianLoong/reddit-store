I (31F) have since found a partner I love. We have a baby together and are getting married next year. I've been missing my mum a lot throughout this - she would be a wonderful grandmother.\n\n\r  \nOne of my mum's friends, 'Lauren', recently got in touch. She had heard about my upcoming wedding. She claimed that whilst unwell in the months leading up to her death, my mum had told Lauren that she should take me wedding dress shopping on her behalf if I ever got married one day. Lauren said she was excited to do this. She also expressed looking forward to helping with my wedding decorations, flowers etc. \n\n\r  \nThere's one problem: I can't STAND Lauren. I have always found her overbearing and rude to the point of dreading gatherings where she will be present (she and her husband remain in my dad's friendship group so attend parties that he hosts). Lauren has made unpleasant remarks about my weight. She was recently bossy and critical of my parenting when I ran into her at my dad's Christmas party ('How come you're supplementing and not fully breastfeeding?' 'Why are you going to put your daughter in nursery when a childminder would be better?' etc). There have been many other examples. I have always responded to such comments in a polite manner and not engaged further, but I don't like it. (I tend to become a doormat when upset out of fear of losing my temper - my fault for enabling rudeness to me, I realise!)\n\n\r  \nEven if I liked Lauren more, I still wouldn't want her involved with my wedding. Dress-shopping feels like a very personal thing to me and I had planned to do it with my future SIL, who I like and trust. In fact, I don't want Lauren at my wedding at all. She was far from my mum's closest friend and I had planned to only invite my mum's childhood best friend and a couple of others who my dad is close to in order to keep him company. My wedding is going to be smallish and simple. I'm a shy person and already dreading the attention - the thought of someone there who I know will be judgemental of me makes it feel so much worse. Lauren and I have never been close and she has never even contacted me before today so I'm amazed she thinks she would be involved in any way.\n\n\r  \nI want to:\r  \n1)\tTell Lauren, politely, that I won't be dress-shopping with her and have other arrangements in hand for the decorations and flowers.\n\nand\r  \n2)\tNot invite Lauren to my wedding.\n\n\r  \nMy dad, whilst supportive of me overall, thinks it would be too harsh of me not to find at least some way to include her. He pointed out that Lauren suffered a bereavement in her own family recently so is in a bad place. He added that whilst we don't know for sure if she's telling the truth about my mum's 'wish' (mum didn't mention it to either of us), if it is true, it would be good to honour it.\n\n\r  \nWIBTA for not inviting Lauren to my wedding or accepting any help from her with dress-shopping and flowers?\r", "created_utc": 1703165117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18nmz38/wibta_if_i_refused_to_let_my_dead_mums_friend/", "score": 508, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is also likely to disappoint Lauren and hurt her feelings at a time when she has recently suffered a bereavement herself. However, I don't want to include her because I'm not close to her personally, I don't think she was really all that close to my mum, and I find her intimidating and rude.

The good part about it being your wedding is that you get to pick who is involved and who is not.\n\nIf you knew for sure what your mum had said to Lauren was true, then I can see how it might be a consideration, but as you have no idea she might just be making it up as a way of inserting herself into the wedding.

You want a wedding that you can remember fondly, and from what you've described, that's one without Lauren.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Wedding dress shopping or anything else in regards to your wedding is both you and your future husband\u2019s choice.

NO NO I insist I will step in blah blah blah* - she seems the type. \n\nJust tell her no. Or, if your dad is worried that will upset her, tell him to tell her no. It will undoubtedly upset her, but you can't help that. If your mother mother had any such concerns, it was for you to have love and support on your wedding day. If Lauren does not spark joy, Lauren don't get to be there.", "YWNBTA\n\nSimply go about your life and your wedding plans without this woman and do your thing.

If she's part of your dad's group, it's rough to cut his group down at a time he may be needing people to go out and meet/be with people. My own dad has been horribly lonely since my  mother passed. So, I'd encourage you to maintain a front for his sake.", "nta. tell your dad you're not Lauren's emotional support animal and tell her NO, thanks for the offer but everything is already taken care of.  buhbye", "NTA, and there are graceful ways to tell her.\n\n\u201cLauren, I so appreciate you reaching out and wanting to fulfill this promise to my mom. I\u2019m sure you brought her a lot of comfort in her passing. My mom and her memory matters so much to me and it means a lot to know that she had such good friends who still remember her with love. I appreciate that my mom was worried I\u2019d have to go dress shopping without close family and friends who I trust and that you were there to alleviate that worry. In the years since my mother passed, I\u2019ve been privileged enough to become close with new family in a way I do not think she ever foresaw or anticipated. In many ways, these relationships are inspired by the close friendships I was lucky enough to witness my mom had with people such as yourself. I\u2019m at a stage where I now have family in my life who are prepared to take me dress shopping and I have already made plans to do so. I\u2019ve also made plans to honor my mom in the process. I\u2019m sure this makes you happy to hear, I know it would have made my mom happy to hear.  So while I very much appreciate your kind offer and the comfort you brought to my mom, it is no longer necessary for you to extend yourself in the way my mom likely believed it would be necessary prior to her passing. I thank you so much for reaching out and being willing to do this if I had needed it. It means a lot to myself and my dad.\u201d\n\nWith the wedding itself, I\u2019d talk to your dad about how he wants to handle his friendships. She shouldn\u2019t be there, and it\u2019s likely more about helping him navigate any fallout if some of his friend circle is invited and others aren\u2019t. Perhaps he explains to his friends that you\u2019re having a small wedding, perhaps he throws you a seperate party at his house for his friends and you agree to attend that (only if you are open to that), perhaps he wants you to do the explaining, or perhaps he doesn\u2019t want to comment at all. Talk to him, but be firm that you do not want her at the wedding or other important events you are planning. Ask him to give you suggestions about appropriate ways to \u201cinclude\u201d her that do not take away from your experience. \n\nThis really can be something as simple as you saying to a group, \u201cI\u2019m having a very small wedding and unfortunately am unable to invite all of my parent\u2019s close friends and extended family. I\u2019d like to include photos of mom with all of her friends, however. I know how much you all meant to her. If you\u2019re willing to share some favorite photos with my mom, I\u2019d deeply appreciate it. Thank you for what you\u2019re doing to help make my day special.\u201d \n\nThen, if she does share, write her a thank you note and tell her how much you appreciated and used a photo and how much it would have meant to your mom to know she still thinks of her.", "You are not obligated to be friends with her just because she was friends with your mother.\n\nIt's your wedding, not hers.\n\nYWNBTA", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for whatever is going on with Lauren and hope she finds peace, but what she did is one of the most manipulative things I have ever heard.\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty for deciding not use your wedding as Lauren\u2019s therapy session.", "NTA - you are not remotely TAH.

She claimed that whilst unwell in the months leading up to her death, my mum had told Lauren that she should take me wedding dress shopping on her behalf if I ever got married one day. Lauren said she was excited to do this. She also expressed looking forward to helping with my wedding decorations, flowers etc. \n\n\r  \nThere's one problem: I can't STAND Lauren. I have always found her overbearing and rude to the point of dreading gatherings where she will be present (she and her husband remain in my dad's friendship group so attend parties that he hosts). Lauren has made unpleasant remarks about my weight. She was recently bossy and critical of my parenting when I ran into her at my dad's Christmas party ('How come you're supplementing and not fully breastfeeding?' 'Why are you going to put your daughter in nursery when a childminder would be better?' etc). There have been many other examples. I have always responded to such comments in a polite manner and not engaged further, but I don't like it. (I tend to become a doormat when upset out of fear of losing my temper - my fault for enabling rudeness to me, I realise!)\n\n\r  \nEven if I liked Lauren more, I still wouldn't want her involved with my wedding. Dress-shopping feels like a very personal thing to me and I had planned to do it with my future SIL, who I like and trust. In fact, I don't want Lauren at my wedding at all. She was far from my mum's closest friend and I had planned to only invite my mum's childhood best friend and a couple of others who my dad is close to in order to keep him company. My wedding is going to be smallish and simple. I'm a shy person and already dreading the attention - the thought of someone there who I know will be judgemental of me makes it feel so much worse. Lauren and I have never been close and she has never even contacted me before today so I'm amazed she thinks she would be involved in any way.\n\n\r  \nI want to:\r  \n1)\tTell Lauren, politely, that I won't be dress-shopping with her and have other arrangements in hand for the decorations and flowers.\n\nand\r  \n2)\tNot invite Lauren to my wedding.\n\n\r  \nMy dad, whilst supportive of me overall, thinks it would be too harsh of me not to find at least some way to include her. He pointed out that Lauren suffered a bereavement in her own family recently so is in a bad place. He added that whilst we don't know for sure if she's telling the truth about my mum's 'wish' (mum didn't mention it to either of us), if it is true, it would be good to honour it.\n\n\r  \nWIBTA for not inviting Lauren to my wedding or accepting any help from her with dress-shopping and flowers?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You are not Laruen's family and, while it is sad that she has suffered a loss, that does not give her the right to impose upon your wedding. I think the gracious thing would be to make her a guest, but that will be her only role.", "NTA - maybe I\u2019m just blunt and witchcy, but I would tell her that those things are being reserved for those closest to you, and that, while she was friends with your mother, she is not close to you. I would also flat out say that your wedding will be small and only include the people you and your fianc\u00e9 are close too, so you hope she will understand not getting an invitation.\n\nBut I tend towards too blunt so YMMV", "Next time she mentions it, tell her you already picked one and show her a picture of something you like, then when you show up in a different dress, you can tell her that you had to change it, the store screwed up and couldn't get it in time", "NTA - she wasn't your mother closest friend and so was unlikely to have been asked to take her place. Yes, you don't know for sure but if it makes you uncomfortable, then err on the side that makes you happy. There is an equally good chance that Lauren wants to shoe-horn herself into any big event going and is using your mother's sad loss to do so.\n\nJust thank her but explain you are moving forward into a new life with your inlaws to be and everything is already under control. The fact she has had a bereavement is neither here or there - if it was a loss of a daughter, then you are in for a world of pain as Lauren makes your day all about her loss. If otherwise, then it is better to concentrate on supporting her own family rather than distracting herself by interfering where she is not needed or wanted. If she is fragile and continues her usual style of communication, you are likely to snap at some point. So don't take that risk.", "NTA. Even if Lauren has the best of intentions, you are not obligated to include someone that you don't like and don't have a relationship with in your wedding. Honestly, it kind of sounds like she would be an absolute nightmare to deal with also. Definitely stand your ground and protect your peace.", "NTA. You don't have to but for the sake of compromise, you can invite her to the wedding. But don't include her in the wedding.", "NTA - but you need to be direct with Lauren, otherwise she will keep badgering.\n\nThanks Lauren for the very generous offer, I am missing my Mom as I navigate these milestones.  However, I prefer to honor her in my own way and I don't want a stand in for my Mom, that would make me miss her even more. \n\nNo need to say more, do not defend your decision (this gives her room for a comeback and to dismiss it), do not tell her your SIL will be coming with you (again, she can argue why she is a better choice).\n\nEven if this is true (which I doubt, as  wouldn't your mother have talked to you about it), you have no need to honor it.  Even if you Mom was still alive, she does not get to direct who is involved in your wedding planning.\n\nDon't invite Lauren, don't tell her ahead of time that she isn't invited.

I hope that you have a happy holiday!\u201d \n\nIf she tries to \u2018assist\u2019 with anything else\u2026it\u2019s already being handled *wink*wink*. If she attempts to bring your Mom into this, you can let her know that you weren\u2019t aware of the promise but everything is taken care of. The point is whatever her response is, everything is being taken care of by someone else that isn\u2019t her. \n\nAs for wedding invites, I would hope that she understands either (a) when reading your message in response, most people would assume a lack of details and involvement mean there is a STRONG chance you aren\u2019t being invited. (B) she\u2019ll figure it out when she doesn\u2019t receive an invite. \n\nYou can always tell her that you\u2019re planning to keep it small and limited to close friends and family, as she is neither hopefully she\u2019ll get the point after that. If she continues to be obtuse you can kindly let her know \u201cI know that you and my Mom shared a very close relationship, unfortunately I can\u2019t say the same about you and I. We are limiting our guest list to close friends and family only and you won\u2019t be receiving an invitation, but if you would like to celebrate at a later date I\u2019m sure that we could arrange something.\u201d \n\nPS: My mother tells me that I can be very brash so if the messages above are toooooo much please feel free to soften the language. You do need to accept that her feelings will be hurt and it is not your job to manage her feelings. The fact is you two don\u2019t share a relationship with each other and going dress shopping with someone you actively dislike and aren\u2019t close to isn\u2019t appealing at all.", "NTA. Stand your ground. I feel like this is Lauren trying to insert herself into your wedding because she either 1) has ruined the relationship to be involved with her daughter/DIL wedding 2) has no children to do this to and you're an easy target 3) she wants a redo of her wedding at your expense/wants bragging rights \n\nJust tell her \"thank you for the offer but I will pass\" but if she keeps pushing then don't be afraid to be harsh.

Repeat as necessary, without varying tone or inflection if she starts getting pushy.", "NTA. I'm sorry you lost your mom. Now is your opportunity to lose Lauren as well.

I've got everything under control, and I'm not inviting anyone other than my SIL dress shopping. Thank you for understanding.'\n\nMight be a bit too blunt for some, but I wouldn't give her an inch. If she argues it's what your mum wanted, kindly remind her that might be so, but it's not what you want, and your mum would understand and respect that.\n\nWhile Lauren has recently lost a loved one, it's not up to you to make her feel better by including her in any way in something so big and important in your life.

I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m also sorry that your father is pushing this. Lauren is simply reaping the consequences of her behavior.  Why is he putting someone who criticizes your body over your feelings?  I would politely and gently but firmly put your foot down on this, and if your dad or Lauren keep bringing it up tell them you\u2019ve made your decision and you\u2019re not willing to discuss it any further than you already have.  Lauren\u2019s bereavement has nothing to do with you. You can be sorry for her loss without the need to tiptoe and accommodate an adult\u2019s  feelings who has been so rude to you.

Don't be surprised if she doesn't clap back.  You need to practice this and maybe have your SIL there in case it gets to be too much and if she is assertive than you let her take over the call.

If she contacted again after the invitations go out, I would only then mention some excuse like the size of the wedding.", "I agree about needing to be direct! It's something I struggle with but I can see how it's better in this situation - thanks for the advice. Anything that leaves the door open / encourages her to get her hopes up seems like a bad call, and probably more hurtful to her in the long run than just saying no thanks.", "The thing to consider about inviting Lauren, though, is that she may make the wedding difficult if she isn't included in the dress shopping. If she's already been known to make judgemental comments about OP's weight etc, I foresee a lot of nasty comments about the dress, about how \"I would have found her something much better\" and a whole bunch of other spiteful crap. Best to avoid that if possible - Lauren sounds like she'll still be nasty about it given the opportunity, but that opportunity shouldn't be on a day of joy for OP. \n\nNTA, by the way. OP, have fun with your SIL.", "And tell your Dad not to pass on any wedding related info, because you KNOW she'll be asking!  And then showing up uninvited to any appointments and/or the wedding because she'll have the info.\n\nIf she does ask about her (presumed) invitation, tell her it's a small intimate wedding with only your closest circle of family and friends.", "u/emilydoooom messaging and recommendation to block/ignore her is perfect. She isn't just crossing boundaries, she's high jumping them.", "I like u/emilydoooom s idea except for one thing.\n\nDon't say sorry. Thank you for thinking of me. But not sorry. It implies guilt. \n\nThe other problem you have is your father. You need him to be on your side and not chirping in your ear about this.\n\nSo tell dad \"Lauren will not have anything to do with my wedding. I want to be with friends and family and people that treat me well. Lauren is frequently rude, and sometimes downright mean to me. I am only polite when I see her for your sake.\"", "You could even go simpler, \"we've got it covered\".  But blocking and dropping the rope is the best answer.\n\nSave your energy for a talk with your dad.  You may need to make it clear that you don't plan to include Lauren in your life.", "Let her know you had a magical time trying on dresses and have something your mum would love. There's no way for her to respond to that negatively without looking like an AH and a drama queen. Plus, when the time comes you'll have a great time with SIL and your mum would have loved anything you love and makes you feel great.", "Since she's the rude overbearing type is it possible she is lying and is doing so because she thinks she's helping?  \n\n\nI could totally see someone well meaning telling what they think is a white lie in an attempt to make things \"better\". Lauren sounds like someone thoughtless enough to not realize that \"Your mom made me promise to take you wedding dress shopping if she couldn't\" wouldn't go over well unless the person you're saying it to legitimately likes you.", "Can you have someone back you up during this conversation? Based on her other comments/criticisms she sounds like she might try to wear you down.", "Yeah, I'm thinking if you say you already have a dress, she might start asking/insisting on seeing it (and then giving her unwelcome opinion). I'd just say, I appreciate you thinking of me at this time, but we have it covered. And then I'd block to avoid drama.\n\nAnd your dad needs to stop trying to convince you. I'd tell him you need him to respect your stance on this and not try to add stress to your wedding by trying to insert her. That she's frequently rude or mean to you and that you won't allow that, or the stress of fearing she might say something nasty, to ruin your enjoyment of wedding planning/the wedding.", "True. True. Used car salesmen, timeshare salesmen, intrusive \u201cFamily Friends,\u201d you gotta be firm.", "Showing respect to your mom's childeren and the results of her raising is more important than showing respect to her memory.", "Your mom loved you, she would want to you to be happy and enjoy these moments to the best of your ability. Those are the wishes you should work on fulfilling.", "No it's not. At the end of the day, this is your wedding. It's bad enough you have to plan it without your mom (I've lost both parents, this is tough stuff, I feel a pang at every life milestone). You shouldn't have this kind of stress added to it, or be forced to include her and listen to her mean comments. I hope your dad will be understanding of that and drop it. I would text her that it's nice she thought of you but it's all handled, and tell your dad he needs to back you up on this and stop bringing it up.\n\nI'm not religious but I do believe our loved ones stay with us in spirit and I really believe that your mom would understand even if you disagreed about things/about Lauren in life. There's no disrespect to her memory at all. My mom and I disagreed about a lot of stuff but I know she'd want me to be happy and stress free on such a big day.", "Coldly rude would be inserting one\u2019s self in a bride-who-just-lost-her-mother\u2019s wedding plans and taking offense to being turned down.", "Happy to be rude to someone who thinks it\u2019s acceptable to make personal comments about someone\u2019s weight, the way they parent and insert themselves into personal events but wasn\u2019t even that close to their mum tbh. Besides, I\u2019m British, it\u2019s our forte", "Seems like it\u2019s a learned behavior from your dad! Of course his take is colored by the fact that he\u2019s also grieving your mother, if he genuinely sees this as a way to honor her or help someone else cope with their grief \u2014 but asking his daughter to devote part of her wedding to someone she hates is a really unreasonable amount of compulsive people-pleasing on his part. I hope you get to practice being polite but direct and self-respecting, and then get to model that for him.", "It may be uncomfortable in the moment, but you\u2019ll feel worse at your wedding if you didn\u2019t shut this down and she is there. Any decent human will understand and be respectful that this day is completely about you, and if she pushes you on it, I\u2019d say something along the lines of space is limited and you and your fianc\u00e9 had to be extremely selective, you appreciate her wanting to be there but also for being understanding & respectful. That way, she now might think twice about her next words/actions. It\u2019s like almost gently parenting her lmao.", "Eh, this is a silly idea. Don\u2019t get OP invested in the idea that there\u2019s a way of successfully appeasing an unreasonable person. OP can set the boundary politely, but she can\u2019t guarantee that Lauren will have a positive response. And that\u2019s fine."]}
