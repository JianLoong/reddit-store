My boyfriend is in a fraternity. \n\nSo my boyfriend got a flag with his fraternity letters on it as a gift from a relative that has passed. The flag got stolen about a year ago. The other day, I saw online that the flag was in the room of some girls in the sorority. My boyfriend asked a family friend who lives in the sorority house and is friends with the girls who took the flag if she could try to grab it 4 days ago and didn\u2019t get a response. He then asked one of his fraternity brothers who is friends with the girls who took it to ask for it back. He said that the response he got from them was that they wanted my bf to ask them for it back himself. This was all part of a power play. Today, my bf texted them politely to get it back and told them it was a gift from a family member. The girls did not respond even though it was confirmed that they saw the text. Here is where I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the asshole. I was let into the sorority house and went up to their room and took the flag back. After this, they responded to my bfs text saying how immature and ridiculous it was that he went and took it from them and pretty much played dumb and acted like they didn\u2019t know the flag was stolen. People in the sorority saw that it was me who took it, and my bf did not even enter the house. I know I shouldn\u2019t have just entered their room but I also know that they would never give the flag back. It was a very hotheaded moment for me and I do wish I did it differently. However, I went back to retrieve stolen property and I didn\u2019t break into the house. I think that doing it this way was the only way to actually get the flag back. All of my friends and bf are saying it\u2019s no big deal and are laughing about it but in very anxious.

You definitely have nothing to be anxious about.", "Good on you, personal property should be just that personal, especially if it is something special, how would these girls feel if a special piece of jewellery was taken from them, probably the exact same way it made your bf feel.

They should be happy that you didn\u2019t report the theft to the police.", "NTA you reclaimed stolen property from a residence you gained legal access to.", "OP, NTA and GOOD FOR YOU! You were awesome.\n\nYou aren't someone who does the wrong thing or tries to hurt others. You were nervous about whether what you did was OK. You clearly were given permission to enter the house. You did enter the room, but what you took was property that (1) belonged to your bf (2) the sorority sisters had been clearly notified that it had been stolen, and (3) they had responded that they were willing to give it back if he asked for it (meaning that they recognized it as his property).\n\nLove how they found the notion of getting back stolen property is immature and ridiculous, but they don't see any immaturity in their own possessing stolen property and refusing to give it back. /s\n\nYou are brave! You are a hero who righted a wrong. I'm really proud of you!", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m so glad you did that !", "NTA\n\nYou are the boss!", "NTA", "NTA.

It may have been a power play as you say or they just wanted to make sure it got back to the original owner.  You don't really know.  But what is known is that you are not the owner of flag and you had no right to enter the room there and take it back, that would be stealing and they should have had you arrested.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was let into the sorority house and went up to their room and took the flag back. \n\nI mean, they stole it and were stroking their egos at fucking around with him. All you did was return it. Sure, you entered under false pretenses, but honestly screw them. A little bit of reality checking violation of boundaries in retaliation for the same might teach these girls that they're far to old to be acting like someone who needs their mom and dad to discipline them.\n\nNTA on the basis that turnabout is fair play.", "NTA. They stole his property. If he has evidence that it is his property, they can't do anything without being charged.\n\nI'm glad I chose technical school over college.

Sliding in behind the mean girls' backs like that, brilliant!", "I think if you steal something and it gets 'stolen' back, you should call it a day and consider yourself lucky no legal action was taken.", "And yes he definitely has proof of ownership and I had his permission to retrieve his belongings. And he has history from days ago of nicely texting and asking people if they can get it back for him", "Is what I did technically breaking and entering? I got let into the sorority house as a whole but entered their unlocked room when they weren\u2019t in there.
