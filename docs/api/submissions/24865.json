I want to tell him, either he loves me and gives me a place to stay or not", "selftext": "I'm 22M and my Dad remarried about 5 years ago, I lived with him until shortly before hand then I moved in with my Mom.\n\nMy Dad's wife has a son that is 38, and he needed a place to stay last year and he declined because he didn't want someone that old living with them.  I have had an apartment the last 3 years with roommates.  I was going to the local college but stopped about Dec 2021. So I been working a couple jobs. I have a car and two roommates we shared a 2 bedroom apartment. They both decided to move in with their GFs. So I need a place to stay. Plus I can't afford an apartment plus tuition.\n\nWell, I want to get back in school and save up money for a new place.\n\nI asked my Dad if I can move in with him. He got back to me last week and said I can move in Labor Day Weekend.  He provided me the following rules:\n\n* I can't have girls in the house, pull up in the driveway, cul-de-sac\n* No guy friends in the house after 8PM or before 10AM (unless driving me to work or class)\n* I can't drink or use marijuana (its legal in our state)\n* He can drug/alcohol test me anytime he chooses.\n* I have to cut the grass, shovel the snow, and complete a weekly grocery store run for his wife.\n* I must attend class everyday I am scheduled\n* I have to keep my own car and I can't borrow his or his wife's.\n* I have a midnight curfew, exception is if I get off work after 11PM, then I have 2 hours to get home. Missing curfew means I can't come home for the evening. Being gone 3 straight days means I have moved out.\n* I have to attend church with him twice a month\n* If his wife ask me to do something I need to do it. If she ask me to do something and it makes me uncomfortable call him, and he will handle it\n\nIn return he said he will do the following:\n\n* Pay for two courses this semester, if I get a B or better he will pay for two more courses next semester.\n* He will provided me an employee referral at his job so I can get a better position for a second job. The security guards make $22/hr but its overnight shift. Its not guaranteed placement, but several people's kids work overnight as security guards, on cleaning crews.\n* 6 months of rent-free living. If I move out by January 1, 2024 he will give me $5K towards a new place.\n\nI think my dad should either help or just say no.  These rules are absurd. I am an adult. I have two jobs and pay for my own car/insurance.  I can legally drink or smoke weed.  He said I can have guy friends over, but not woman.  I have a couple of good friends that are women, and its weird inviting over some of my guy buddies but not them. His request are completely controlling. I think he made these rules so I would say no, and if I said yes, if I break the rules he can kick me out anyway.  \n\n\nShould I request I am able to move in until I find a new place in a few months and these rules are absurd.", "created_utc": 1692280412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tob1o/aita_i_22m_need_to_move_in_with_my_dad_who_is/", "score": 383, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wants to help me, he should provide me a place to live, then I will save and move out.\n\nI told him I question how much he really cares because it took him nearly a week to get back to me if I could move in, and then I can't move in until Labor Day, and I need to move by August 31.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ### [Moderators needed - Join the landed gentry](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/155zepq/moderators_needed_join_the_landed_gentry/)\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Some of these rules seem really over the top. Is there a reason for them? No female friends even near the house? The drug testing?", ">I am an adult. I have two jobs and pay for my own car/insurance.\n\nBut not rent, apparently. \n\nYes, some of these rules are a bit daft, but \n\n1. The chores that have been set are fair in lieu of paying rent and a fair contribution to running the household, and \n\n2. They are about the sort of life you Dad and his wife want to lead - they don't want your friends coming over at all hours and all that, they don't want to meet your girlfriend over breakfast.  \n\nMoving back home at 22 is more like being in a house sharing arrangement than reverting to being a child in the family home. They're being very clear with you about how they expect that to work, not unlike a lot of shared households. You're not moving \"back\" as a child, nor staying as a guest. Whether you want to live like that with your parents will depend on how much you can't afford to rent somewhere else instead.\n\nYou can try telling him that he either gives you a place to stay or he doesn't, but you don't get to kick off if he says \"no worries, we'll keep the guest room then.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA, i think you're getting a great deal with the free rent an tuition. He has boundaries that he's asking you respect. It's not about him treating you like a child.\n\nWhat you're saying is, if you don't let me do whatever i like them you obviously don't love me. That's really unfair.", "Are some of his rules a little ridiculous? yeah, mostly the ones about visitors and drug testing. He either trusts you to make good decisions or he doesn't. I'm not super crazy about the church thing cuz I don't like that being forced on someone in exchange for housing.\n\nBut the others? generally reasonable. \n\nExpecting you to go to class and do chores are the house are perfectly reasonable. Even things like you are responsible for your own transportation and curfew can be reasonable. I know it doesn't sound like it- but if they aren't night people you getting home late will be disturbing to anyone else in the household. \n\nDoing what his wife asks unless it makes you uncomfortable is also fair.\n\nI do think it's reasonable to negotiable//clarify up front what the rent would be after 6 months and to clarify whether he and wife are responsible for the costs of the weekly grocery run.\n\nso ESH i guess cuz there are rules I have issues with but you're 22, your father isn't responsible to house you anymore but is offering to.", "YTA. I love when young adults pull the \"I'm an adult!\" card...like technically you are but if you are unable to afford to live on your own or sacrifice something now for something better down the road then you really aren't behaving like an adult. While I agree there are quite a few rules, your dad doesn't want his way of life changed more than it needs to be. This isn't a situation he wanted, and while he is offering help with conditions, it is better than no help at all. Some of the rules are probably designed to be uncomfortable for you, as an incentive so you don't want to stay long term.", "YTA. Push back and even that offer will likely be rescinded. Rules/conditions like those don't come out of thin air, so do you have some history of being difficult?\n\nAnd considering the generous \"carrot\" he is dangling if you do manage good behaviour and move out  in a timely fashion---you're a fool if you don't see that the trade-off is well to your benefit.", "I'll go against the grain and say ESH. Some of these rules are insane and excessive. Just because it's someone's house doesn't mean they aren't being a dick. Again, legality does not equal \"not an asshole\". \n\nHowever, you have to be for real. Just tell him no and if you're in a city, there are plenty of Facebook groups where you can find a roommate. A lot of us were 22 once. It sucks. But do you really want to deal with this bullshit, or deal with a fight if you say that to him?", "I can see some of these rules in the light of a few horror stories I've read here. Does he have some reason not to trust you to behave with just standard respect? \n\nBut some of these rules are just controlling for its own sake, like forcing you to go to church, which is outrageous. Religion is personal, not something for fascist mentalities to toy with.\n\nIt's possible that your father doesn't want you moving in at all and thus made this deliberately outraging, so you would back off and he wouldn't have to seem like the bad guy?\n\nDo you have a good relationship with him (and his wife)? Because I could see a son faced with this crackpot list saying no thanks and then going NC on him. Would he dislike that and change his tune?\n\nI really think he's playing with fire here. But maybe he wants to burn down the relationship.\n\nNTA. Your father is at the least a very unpleasant man.", "These comments are wild! You're NTA, but your dad clearly is. Do you guys live in the US? As a European, I find the mentality of kicking your kids out at 18 stupid and harmful. You described your situation perfectly well, you need temporary accommodation since your roommates moved out. You go to college and work. Your dad should be more than happy to provide this for you and help you out. The whole no girls in the house etc etc is abusive. Forcing you to go to church?? You are an adult, you are allowed to have a life as long as you guys are being respectful. Not to mention the surprise drug tests \u2013 what is he gonna do, hold a cup for you to piss in? This is just ridiculous. Also the wife's son is a different situation because yeah, at 38 you'd be expected to have yourself a little more sorted out. But a 22 year old college student needs the extra help.", "YTA and likely a complete dipshit. Maybe your mom can offer a spot more to your liking. If you choose not to move in with your dad HE dodged a bullet.", "ESH. His roof. His rules. You can always negotiate, but in the end, either you will succeed or you won't.

Good luck?", "i honestly think YTA. yeah the rules are a bit cray but he\u2019s offering some good deals in return for the rules followed. sounds like he also wants to make sure you\u2019re getting your shit done and won\u2019t end up freeloading. he\u2019s not charging rent and even offering to cover classes. these are his boundaries. \n\nif he gave you these rules without anything in return i might have changed my tune but, dude is literally going to GIVE you thousands of dollars for both school and as a return, as well as a job. ngl i think you\u2019d be dumb to decline.", "YTA\n\nYou're getting 6 months of free rent and 5k towards your new place.  His house, his rules.  Most of these rules tell me he's trying to get  you back in school and on your feet so that you don't become a permanent burden to him.  So you don't try moving back again in 3 years.  You've been screwing around since 2021. \n\nGood luck, either way.", "INFO: I think we need to understand why your father is making these rules. They do seem very extreme but I'm wondering if you stopped attending school in December of 2021 because you were partying a lot. I guess what I'm getting at is was he always this draconian or did it just start? I'm not saying its the right way to treat you if my assumption is correct, but it does seem relevant.\n\nMaybe these rules are just because he's religious, in which case then I don't know why you're turning to him, even if he backed down on some of the rules you'd still be living in a hostile environment.", "YTA. Those are reasonable conditions. Except maybe the \u201cnever after midnight\u201d - possibly that could be negotiated into a \u201cone night per month with prior agreement on both sides\u201d. (And if you understood why the rest of the conditions are reasonable, then a small negotiation on this one would be a fair expectation - the fact you don\u2019t seem to know this explains why they needed this midnight rule!) \n\nYou are choosing to disturb the lifestyle they have chosen together. \n\nThey don\u2019t currently have an open door policy for random young people to come over & make noise & fill up their kitchen or living room or garden. \n\nThey don\u2019t have to worry about being woken up at 3am by someone drunkenly making their way to bed. \n\nThey don\u2019t have to think about someone else making messes that they don\u2019t clear up after. \n\nThe compromise he has suggested is the middle line between them keeping their nice calm lifestyle *that they have chosen and presumably enjoy!* and the young student frat house lifestyle you would prefer. \n\nThat middle line is allowing you to stay there\u2026.! \n\n**The fact that you don\u2019t understand that his offer is already a massive compromise on his part, and on his wife\u2019s, is what makes you the AH**. \n\nAlso - I suspect the rules around no drugs & drug tests & going to classes are based on your previous history with these things. We wouldn\u2019t consider putting at least the first 2 as conditions on my partner\u2019s kids if they wanted to move back in - because we wouldn\u2019t need to - they party on occasion, but also know how to balance that with other parts of life. We probably would put the last condition in place (around attending classes etc) if we were offering free rent only to support attending college. That would seem reasonable - if the college stops happening, the free rent would also no longer be appropriate. \n\nYTA for not understanding any of this.", "YTA!! You sound so entitled and most definitely ungrateful! I bet if your dad read your post he would feel like a failure as a parent to have raised someone with that attitude.  Did you even read your own post? You dad is being very generous and is setting you up with a plan to regain your independence for the long term. Every one of those conditions is reasonable (I wouldn't love the church one but if two Sundays a month means no rent and free school then AMEN!).

ARE YOU FCKIN SERIOUS?? I mean, I could maybe see the ESH, in a way... But calling him an asshole.. WHY? Because he's living in a modern society, has a difficult time and needs help, but doesn't want to follow archaic, and unreasonable rules, that were in effect more than 50 years ago?\n\nYes, it is perfectly normal for him to lay some rules, as it is indeed his house. And some of them are perfectly logical, for example the chores, helping his wife, or the car arrangement.. But most are absolutely outrageous!\n\n* Curfew on a 22 year old?? When is it, 1950?\n* Drug and alcohol tests?? I've had a long day at work and i want to enjoy a beer and chill. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THAT?\n* Going to church with him? So he's literally forcing his religion and beliefs on an adult. AND ALL OF YOU SAY IT'S OK?\n* About the girls and friends, I kinda get it, but if you are quiet and respectfull, I still don't see why it's so bad.\n\nWhat a lot of people said makes sense, that maybe these rules are so strict on purpose, for you to say no, or not stay long. I get that he want's his own space with wife, and you might be something extra, that will ruin it.

His house his rules to a point plus he is helping pay for some college", "Question - have you asked your dad why all the strict rules?  Is there any room for negotiation, or is your dad one of those \"his way or the highway\" type of men?", "I feel like we're missing some info here, like why you stopped going to school the first time, if you have a history of being an entitled asshole and partying and otherwise being disrespectful of other people's homes and needs. Most of these rules seem absolutely sane, the drug/alcohol testing and requirements for helping around the house and attending church sound like you have had issues in the past that we don't know about. Asking you not to drink or do drugs while living with him isn't unreasonable, nor is it unreasonable for them to ask you not to have people over during times they want their home to be a quiet safe haven for themselves. You aren't talking about being roommates where you both share equal responsibilities with your dad, it is their home and they do hold the power there. He's also offered you a lot of benefits to live there too by trying to help you find a better job and paying for classes.

If you are in the US, that can be very tough to do. You ARE an adult, but maybe an immature one. If you're moving into someone else's home, you have to respect how they want it to run. You are receiving a generous offer of help and it comes with conditions. You can say yes or no, or try to negotiate from a respectful place.

The dad's offer is extremely generous with 6 mo free rent, 5k down payment and tuition reimbursement for 2 and up to 6 courses. In my area, that's about a potential $15,000 assistance,  at least. (Assuming a shared apartment is 1k rent. A single apartment here is near 2k-3k, a single class in cc is about 2k). \n\nAnd that's excluding that the dad is offering OP a better job that can transition a career or looks good on a resume. I would have taken that offer in a heartbeat. \n\nHowever, the key areas that OP is targeting and worried about are the restrictions on alcohol, drugs and friends staying at odd hours. That makes me wonder if there was a point if OP potentially had substance issues. \n\nThis seems more like the parent has identified that their child has faced some problems is and trying to give them a helping hand and get them clean and sober. This is purely speculation but that's what I'm reading it as, based on experience. The line \"either you love me or you don't\" is a manipulation tactic I faced a lot with a family member going through similar problems.\n\nIf that were the case, then I can understand the restrictions that the dad is placing and it's his way of taking care of his adult son. Regardless, the offer is great and this is more of a choosing begger situation with the son guilting the father to accept him unconditionally. \n\nHowever, I do strongly feel there is a reason those conditions are there for a reason. \n\nOP, unless you are offering to pay your father rent, then YTA by trying to manipulate him using familial bonds. You are an adult, and he is trying to help you. If you don't want to receive help, then don't but rejecting this offer will come back to bite you.

He can control who comes into his house, but he cannot control who hangs out outside of his house on public property. That's ridiculous. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd honestly, not allowing the opposite gender of friends to come over at all throughout the day, is a little bit controlling and treating them like a child.

Especially considering that it's as a security job, the role likely has rules about drugs and alcohol and may also perform random drug testing. \n\nOP also doesn't say why he stopped going to school. Dad might just be trying to help get his act together. The rules are strict but in exchange OP will receive a lot of help.", "Absolutely - these rules didn't come from out of the blue.

Could OP offer to take a hair test to show that they haven't been using drugs in the past X period and could they do volunteering twice a month in place of going to church. Or if they dislike their parents specific church to attend a different church twice a month.  \n\nBut if dad has a hard line on those then OP's options are to either take the offer or not. But he's really shooting himself in the foot financially if he thinks staying out late and legal weed use X months is worth more than free rent and college tuition paid.", "If i am honest, to me it seems that OP\u2019s father thinks that OP is ruining their life with alcohol/drugs. I just have a hard time believing that this rule is based on nothing.\n\nAnd i am an atheist; my mom let me live with her when i had health issues and just wasnt able to care for myself properly. I sucked it up and went to church when she wanted me to (like every couple of months in my case); because that was a very low price to pay for peaceful cohabitation and rent-free living and it cost me nothing.\n\nAnd also; the church requirement isnt that excessive; thats not them trying to convert OP. Thats them either being worried or trying to keep up appearances.", "I think the problem, and the reason why the comments are so divided, is because some of these rules are reasonable and some are very controlling.\n\nFor example, helping with chores and getting groceries, going to all his classes and keeping his own car? Fair\n\nGetting to drug and alcohol test whenever he wants, going to church and having to do everything the wife says? That's crossing the line, specially the last one, because it sounds easy but actually living through that is hell, one day the wife won't want to get up for a glass of water, tell OP to do it when he's busy doing something important, wife will blow it out of proportion and he'll out on the street.\n\nNTA, it's a bad deal", "I feel like \"don't do recreational drugs while I let you live with me for free\" is completely fine. The church thing is a bit meh but it's only twice a month.", "Yep.  Those two jump out as outliers, and bit nutty.  Otherwise this feels extremely reasonable, and OP can take it or leave it.\n\nWe also don\u2019t know if OP has had any past issues with substances.  Seems unlikely parents would jump to testing threats without some reason.", "Controlling perhaps - but its the home owners choice to set the boundaries by which they will accept someone into their space. OP has the choice to not accept - or even to try to negotiate some... but maybe the dad simply doesn't want the grief of having a bunch of 20-something dudes hanging out or the drama that comes with drug use in the house.", "You sure this isn't your brother posting lol?  The fact that his dad wants to set a condition of drug/alcohol testing at any time means there's huge mistrust there.

Op can take it as work or another chore and bear with it.", "My wife lived under her parents\u2019s roof until age 23. She paid no rent or any other expenses. She had a curfew.

This incentive from the parent is what makes me think OP has messed up in the past and Dad is trying to incentivize to help his son  get an education and focus on school. \n\nAt he end of it whether he thinks these rules are good or not he has the choice to find another place.", "NTA\n\nUh it sounds like he doesn\u2019t want the extra shit, just to be able to move in or not. \n\n\nYou people calling him TA are absurd and clearly never had loving parents or children.", "It would be really interesting to see a split on age differences between YTAs and NTAs here. \n\nFor my part, OP is free to do whatever the hell he wants with his life, right up until he moves into somebody else\u2019s house RENT FREE.

And maybe they can be negotiated but its still at the end of the day his house his rules", "Yea it was she forced church that did it for me.... I lived at home until I was 23 and was respectful as in I didn't have anyone stay the night and didn't come home at odd hours but I was never given a single curfew or drug tested much less alcohol tested. Like that is absurd. I live in Canada where it is legal to drink at 19. I consider this very controlling", "bro what\u2026 his parents are totally allowed to not want him to bring random girls over", "I mean, for rent free living, a halfway house has a lot of the same rules.

Small price to pay considering the perks dad is offering.", "Well I suppose if he belongs to a satanic cult that would be unreasonable. Two days a month isn\u2019t gonna kill him.
