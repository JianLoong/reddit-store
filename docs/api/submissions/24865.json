I have had an apartment the last 3 years with roommates.  I was going to the local college but stopped about Dec 2021. So I been working a couple jobs. I have a car and two roommates we shared a 2 bedroom apartment. They both decided to move in with their GFs. So I need a place to stay. Plus I can't afford an apartment plus tuition.\n\nWell, I want to get back in school and save up money for a new place.\n\nI asked my Dad if I can move in with him. He got back to me last week and said I can move in Labor Day Weekend.  He provided me the following rules:\n\n* I can't have girls in the house, pull up in the driveway, cul-de-sac\n* No guy friends in the house after 8PM or before 10AM (unless driving me to work or class)\n* I can't drink or use marijuana (its legal in our state)\n* He can drug/alcohol test me anytime he chooses.\n* I have to cut the grass, shovel the snow, and complete a weekly grocery store run for his wife.\n* I must attend class everyday I am scheduled\n* I have to keep my own car and I can't borrow his or his wife's.\n* I have a midnight curfew, exception is if I get off work after 11PM, then I have 2 hours to get home. Missing curfew means I can't come home for the evening. Being gone 3 straight days means I have moved out.\n* I have to attend church with him twice a month\n* If his wife ask me to do something I need to do it. If she ask me to do something and it makes me uncomfortable call him, and he will handle it\n\nIn return he said he will do the following:\n\n* Pay for two courses this semester, if I get a B or better he will pay for two more courses next semester.\n* He will provided me an employee referral at his job so I can get a better position for a second job. The security guards make $22/hr but its overnight shift. Its not guaranteed placement, but several people's kids work overnight as security guards, on cleaning crews.\n* 6 months of rent-free living. If I move out by January 1, 2024 he will give me $5K towards a new place.\n\nI think my dad should either help or just say no.  These rules are absurd. I am an adult. I have two jobs and pay for my own car/insurance.  I can legally drink or smoke weed.  He said I can have guy friends over, but not woman.  I have a couple of good friends that are women, and its weird inviting over some of my guy buddies but not them. His request are completely controlling. I think he made these rules so I would say no, and if I said yes, if I break the rules he can kick me out anyway.  \n\n\nShould I request I am able to move in until I find a new place in a few months and these rules are absurd.", "created_utc": 1692280412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tob1o/aita_i_22m_need_to_move_in_with_my_dad_who_is/", "score": 5686, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some of these rules seem really over the top. Is there a reason for them? No female friends even near the house? The drug testing?", ">I am an adult. I have two jobs and pay for my own car/insurance.\n\nBut not rent, apparently. \n\nYes, some of these rules are a bit daft, but \n\n1. The chores that have been set are fair in lieu of paying rent and a fair contribution to running the household, and \n\n2. They are about the sort of life you Dad and his wife want to lead - they don't want your friends coming over at all hours and all that, they don't want to meet your girlfriend over breakfast.  \n\nMoving back home at 22 is more like being in a house sharing arrangement than reverting to being a child in the family home. They're being very clear with you about how they expect that to work, not unlike a lot of shared households. You're not moving \"back\" as a child, nor staying as a guest. Whether you want to live like that with your parents will depend on how much you can't afford to rent somewhere else instead.\n\nYou can try telling him that he either gives you a place to stay or he doesn't, but you don't get to kick off if he says \"no worries, we'll keep the guest room then.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA, i think you're getting a great deal with the free rent an tuition. He has boundaries that he's asking you respect. It's not about him treating you like a child.\n\nWhat you're saying is, if you don't let me do whatever i like them you obviously don't love me. That's really unfair.", "Are some of his rules a little ridiculous? yeah, mostly the ones about visitors and drug testing. He either trusts you to make good decisions or he doesn't. I'm not super crazy about the church thing cuz I don't like that being forced on someone in exchange for housing.\n\nBut the others? generally reasonable. \n\nExpecting you to go to class and do chores are the house are perfectly reasonable. Even things like you are responsible for your own transportation and curfew can be reasonable. I know it doesn't sound like it- but if they aren't night people you getting home late will be disturbing to anyone else in the household. \n\nDoing what his wife asks unless it makes you uncomfortable is also fair.\n\nI do think it's reasonable to negotiable//clarify up front what the rent would be after 6 months and to clarify whether he and wife are responsible for the costs of the weekly grocery run.\n\nso ESH i guess cuz there are rules I have issues with but you're 22, your father isn't responsible to house you anymore but is offering to.", "[deleted]", "YTA.

Some of these rules are insane and excessive. Just because it's someone's house doesn't mean they aren't being a dick. Again, legality does not equal \"not an asshole\". \n\nHowever, you have to be for real. Just tell him no and if you're in a city, there are plenty of Facebook groups where you can find a roommate. A lot of us were 22 once. It sucks. But do you really want to deal with this bullshit, or deal with a fight if you say that to him?", "I can see some of these rules in the light of a few horror stories I've read here. Does he have some reason not to trust you to behave with just standard respect? \n\nBut some of these rules are just controlling for its own sake, like forcing you to go to church, which is outrageous. Religion is personal, not something for fascist mentalities to toy with.\n\nIt's possible that your father doesn't want you moving in at all and thus made this deliberately outraging, so you would back off and he wouldn't have to seem like the bad guy?\n\nDo you have a good relationship with him (and his wife)? Because I could see a son faced with this crackpot list saying no thanks and then going NC on him. Would he dislike that and change his tune?\n\nI really think he's playing with fire here. But maybe he wants to burn down the relationship.\n\nNTA. Your father is at the least a very unpleasant man.", "These comments are wild! You're NTA, but your dad clearly is. Do you guys live in the US? As a European, I find the mentality of kicking your kids out at 18 stupid and harmful. You described your situation perfectly well, you need temporary accommodation since your roommates moved out. You go to college and work. Your dad should be more than happy to provide this for you and help you out. The whole no girls in the house etc etc is abusive. Forcing you to go to church?? You are an adult, you are allowed to have a life as long as you guys are being respectful. Not to mention the surprise drug tests \u2013 what is he gonna do, hold a cup for you to piss in? This is just ridiculous. Also the wife's son is a different situation because yeah, at 38 you'd be expected to have yourself a little more sorted out.

So you don't try moving back again in 3 years.  You've been screwing around since 2021. \n\nGood luck, either way.", "INFO: I think we need to understand why your father is making these rules. They do seem very extreme but I'm wondering if you stopped attending school in December of 2021 because you were partying a lot. I guess what I'm getting at is was he always this draconian or did it just start? I'm not saying its the right way to treat you if my assumption is correct, but it does seem relevant.\n\nMaybe these rules are just because he's religious, in which case then I don't know why you're turning to him, even if he backed down on some of the rules you'd still be living in a hostile environment.", "YTA. Those are reasonable conditions. Except maybe the \u201cnever after midnight\u201d - possibly that could be negotiated into a \u201cone night per month with prior agreement on both sides\u201d. (And if you understood why the rest of the conditions are reasonable, then a small negotiation on this one would be a fair expectation - the fact you don\u2019t seem to know this explains why they needed this midnight rule!) \n\nYou are choosing to disturb the lifestyle they have chosen together. \n\nThey don\u2019t currently have an open door policy for random young people to come over & make noise & fill up their kitchen or living room or garden. \n\nThey don\u2019t have to worry about being woken up at 3am by someone drunkenly making their way to bed. \n\nThey don\u2019t have to think about someone else making messes that they don\u2019t clear up after. \n\nThe compromise he has suggested is the middle line between them keeping their nice calm lifestyle *that they have chosen and presumably enjoy!* and the young student frat house lifestyle you would prefer. \n\nThat middle line is allowing you to stay there\u2026.! \n\n**The fact that you don\u2019t understand that his offer is already a massive compromise on his part, and on his wife\u2019s, is what makes you the AH**. \n\nAlso - I suspect the rules around no drugs & drug tests & going to classes are based on your previous history with these things. We wouldn\u2019t consider putting at least the first 2 as conditions on my partner\u2019s kids if they wanted to move back in - because we wouldn\u2019t need to - they party on occasion, but also know how to balance that with other parts of life. We probably would put the last condition in place (around attending classes etc) if we were offering free rent only to support attending college. That would seem reasonable - if the college stops happening, the free rent would also no longer be appropriate. \n\nYTA for not understanding any of this.", "YTA!! You sound so entitled and most definitely ungrateful! I bet if your dad read your post he would feel like a failure as a parent to have raised someone with that attitude.  Did you even read your own post? You dad is being very generous and is setting you up with a plan to regain your independence for the long term. Every one of those conditions is reasonable (I wouldn't love the church one but if two Sundays a month means no rent and free school then AMEN!).

ARE YOU FCKIN SERIOUS?? I mean, I could maybe see the ESH, in a way... But calling him an asshole.. WHY? Because he's living in a modern society, has a difficult time and needs help, but doesn't want to follow archaic, and unreasonable rules, that were in effect more than 50 years ago?\n\nYes, it is perfectly normal for him to lay some rules, as it is indeed his house. And some of them are perfectly logical, for example the chores, helping his wife, or the car arrangement.. But most are absolutely outrageous!\n\n* Curfew on a 22 year old?? When is it, 1950?\n* Drug and alcohol tests?? I've had a long day at work and i want to enjoy a beer and chill. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THAT?\n* Going to church with him?

Most of these rules seem absolutely sane, the drug/alcohol testing and requirements for helping around the house and attending church sound like you have had issues in the past that we don't know about. Asking you not to drink or do drugs while living with him isn't unreasonable, nor is it unreasonable for them to ask you not to have people over during times they want their home to be a quiet safe haven for themselves.

He's also offered you a lot of benefits to live there too by trying to help you find a better job and paying for classes.

If you are in the US, that can be very tough to do. You ARE an adult, but maybe an immature one. If you're moving into someone else's home, you have to respect how they want it to run. You are receiving a generous offer of help and it comes with conditions. You can say yes or no, or try to negotiate from a respectful place.

The dad's offer is extremely generous with 6 mo free rent, 5k down payment and tuition reimbursement for 2 and up to 6 courses. In my area, that's about a potential $15,000 assistance,  at least. (Assuming a shared apartment is 1k rent. A single apartment here is near 2k-3k, a single class in cc is about 2k). \n\nAnd that's excluding that the dad is offering OP a better job that can transition a career or looks good on a resume. I would have taken that offer in a heartbeat. \n\nHowever, the key areas that OP is targeting and worried about are the restrictions on alcohol, drugs and friends staying at odd hours. That makes me wonder if there was a point if OP potentially had substance issues. \n\nThis seems more like the parent has identified that their child has faced some problems is and trying to give them a helping hand and get them clean and sober. This is purely speculation but that's what I'm reading it as, based on experience. The line \"either you love me or you don't\" is a manipulation tactic I faced a lot with a family member going through similar problems.\n\nIf that were the case, then I can understand the restrictions that the dad is placing and it's his way of taking care of his adult son. Regardless, the offer is great and this is more of a choosing begger situation with the son guilting the father to accept him unconditionally. \n\nHowever, I do strongly feel there is a reason those conditions are there for a reason. \n\nOP, unless you are offering to pay your father rent, then YTA by trying to manipulate him using familial bonds.

That's ridiculous. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nAnd honestly, not allowing the opposite gender of friends to come over at all throughout the day, is a little bit controlling and treating them like a child.

Especially considering that it's as a security guard, the role likely has rules about drugs and alcohol and may also perform random drug testing. \n\nOP also doesn't say why he stopped going to school. Dad might just be trying to help get his act together. The rules are strict but in exchange OP will receive a lot of help.", "Absolutely - these rules didn't come from out of the blue.

Could OP offer to take a hair test to show that they haven't been using drugs in the past X period and could they do volunteering twice a month in place of going to church. Or if they dislike their parents specific church to attend a different church twice a month.  \n\nBut if dad has a hard line on those then OP's options are to either take the offer or not. But he's really shooting himself in the foot financially if he thinks staying out late and legal weed use X months is worth more than free rent and college tuition paid.", "If i am honest, to me it seems that OP\u2019s father thinks that OP is ruining their life with alcohol/drugs. I just have a hard time believing that this rule is based on nothing.\n\nAnd i am an atheist; my mom let me live with her when i had health issues and just wasnt able to care for myself properly. I sucked it up and went to church when she wanted me to (like every couple of months in my case); because that was a very low price to pay for peaceful cohabitation and rent-free living and it cost me nothing.\n\nAnd also; the church requirement isnt that excessive; thats not them trying to convert OP. Thats them either being worried or trying to keep up appearances.", "I think the problem, and the reason why the comments are so divided, is because some of these rules are reasonable and some are very controlling.\n\nFor example, helping with chores and getting groceries, going to all his classes and keeping his own car? Fair\n\nGetting to drug and alcohol test whenever he wants, going to church and having to do everything the wife says? That's crossing the line, specially the last one, because it sounds easy but actually living through that is hell, one day the wife won't want to get up for a glass of water, tell OP to do it when he's busy doing something important, wife will blow it out of proportion and he'll out on the street.\n\nNTA, it's a bad deal", "I feel like \"don't do recreational drugs while I let you live with me for free\" is completely fine. The church thing is a bit meh but it's only twice a month.", "Yep.  Those two jump out as outliers, and bit nutty.  Otherwise this feels extremely reasonable, and OP can take it or leave it.\n\nWe also don\u2019t know if OP has had any past issues with substances.  Seems unlikely parents would jump to testing threats without some reason.", "Controlling perhaps - but its the home owners choice to set the boundaries by which they will accept someone into their space. OP has the choice to not accept - or even to try to negotiate some... but maybe the dad simply doesn't want the grief of having a bunch of 20-something dudes hanging out or the drama that comes with drug use in the house.", "You sure this isn't your brother posting lol?  The fact that his dad wants to set a condition of drug/alcohol testing at any time means there's huge mistrust there. So OP is probably an addict but didn't want to state that and color the scenario with truth.", "So where does OP go?", "I wouldn\u2019t want my kids to have people over after 8.

The old couple want some quiet and don't want to hear the guy come back home at 2am after partying\n\nThe drug and alcohol pay seems excessive without cause.

This incentive from the parent is what makes me think OP has messed up in the past and Dad is trying to incentivize to help his son  get an education and focus on school. \n\nAt he end of it whether he thinks these rules are good or not he has the choice to find another place.", "NTA\n\nUh it sounds like he doesn\u2019t want the extra shit, just to be able to move in or not. \n\n\nYou people calling him TA are absurd and clearly never had loving parents or children.", "It would be really interesting to see a split on age differences between YTAs and NTAs here. \n\nFor my part, OP is free to do whatever the hell he wants with his life, right up until he moves into somebody else\u2019s house RENT FREE.

I lived at home until I was 23 and was respectful as in I didn't have anyone stay the night and didn't come home at odd hours but I was never given a single curfew or drug tested much less alcohol tested.

The way I see it parents have a duty towards the child no matter how old they are cause they put them in this world, and that doesn't mean they get to treat them as children just because they're going through a rough period. He can still help put while treating you like an adult. Would he demand respect for such rules from an older friend of his or his brother if he has one? But I doubt he will listen or see it this way.

Maybe try Mom again. NTA", "Let's examine the rules one by one.\n\n1. \"No girls in the house, and guys have to be out by 8.\" A bit much, imo. It assumes that you're straight and have only male friends, at least one of which is wrong. Your dad not wanting you to be having sex in the house is fine, and requiring your friends to be out early in the night is... okay, I guess, but the wording is misogynistic and heteronormative. What if you're gay? Checkmate dad.\n2. \"No drinking or doing weed and I can test you for either whenever I want.\" This entirely depends on your history with both. Not wanting you to drink or do drugs in the house, or come home drunk/high is fine. The drug tests are invasive and unreasonable if you have no history of drug/alcohol abuse, and are okay if you do. \n3. \"You must cut the grass, shovel snow, and grocery shop while you live here.\" 100% fine and honestly somewhat expected. If you live somewhere, you should do your fair share of the chores. Specifying intensive outdoor tasks does raise an eyebrow, but presumably your dad doesn't believe that men should wash dishes, or anything else for that matter. Does make me wonder what he's going to be doing while you live there...\n4. \"You must attend all your classes.\" You should be doing this anyways, especially since dad's paying for the classes now.\n5. \"You have to keep your car and can't borrow mine or my wife's.\" A reasonable rule, as long as your car is also off-limits for them. Do onto others and all that.\n6. \"You must be home by midnight unless you're working late.\" Okay, I guess. Giving a 22 year old a curfew is weird but hey at least you'll just get a reasonable punishment if you stay out too late-\n7. \"If you miss curfew you can't come home for the night, and if you're gone for three days you've moved out.\" I'm sorry, *what*?? This is *actively dangerous* for you. There's been cases of teens/young adults getting locked out of the house and dying or having much worse things happen to them *because they got locked out*. I'd decline the offer based on this rule alone. At least the rest of the rules are perfectly reasonable-\n8. \"You have to attend church with me twice a month.\" So. He's religious. That explains a lot. I dearly hope I don't have to explain to anyone why being forced to attend church by someone with power over you is a bad thing.\n9. \"If my wife asks you to do something, you must do it unless it makes you uncomfortable, in which case I'll handle it.\" Haha no. Uncomfortable is a very vague word, and I'd be concerned with this rule even without the previous rules in place. This could very well lead to you being treated as a servant or worse by your stepmom, depending on what kind of person she is. Overall, my hopes are not high.\n\nThe benefits are also concerning with the rules in mind. He's paying for your education and housing, presumably is paying for your food as well, and can likely get your job taken away, since he's the reason why you got it in the first place. Worst case scenario is he'll try and induct you into a cult, best case scenario is you're almost 100% dependent on him for at least half a year, and have a severely restricted social life.\n\nMy verdict is NTA.

Then cut off your dad - it will spare you a lot of agony.\n\nOption #2 is risky because you are setting yourself up as a target of abuse. By agreeing to these rules, you are communicating that you have no personal (or even spiritual) boundaries. You will end up in a very vulnerable situation.

Even if he does not have a substance abuse problem and we\u2019re all completely off base (which I doubt) it\u2019s still a ridiculously good offer for free rent/college classes.\n\nOP take the olive branch that your Dad is giving you and run with it, and if you do have a problem with substances use this as an opportunity to take a break from that lifestyle and see where an education and clean life can take you.

I feel like I could put up with a lot for 4 months and in exchange I get 4 classes paid for, a free place to stay, and 5k in case.

A lot of context is missing to give a complete judgment imo.\n\nEdit: okay looking at some of OP\u2019s comments it looks like OP had a pregnancy scare in the recent past, which is probably what led to the \u201cno girls\u201d rule and curfew rules. And claims that his dad thinks he dropped out because of drinking and partying. \n\nSo it literally is a dad who wants his kid to hunker down and focus so he can get his life back on track (in dad\u2019s eyes). Was OP\u2019s life completely off track? Don\u2019t really have the full info there. OP could be downplaying how much of an issue things actually were or it could just be because his dad doesn\u2019t drink so doesn\u2019t want his kid to be involved with any kind of drinking/partying. \n\nEither way, for only 6 months of it I\u2019d go for it and then get out.", "The drug and alcohol testing make perfect sense if your adult child is an addict or is a functional alcoholic, something that OP is unlikely to admit to.", "Same.

My guess is the parents have been through some stuff with OP and are being very careful now.", "Actually, the only rule that would make me super nervous is the one where he has to do anything the wife asks when she asks it.\n\nThe other rules are pretty clear boundaries and at least you know what to expect. A rule where someone can ask me to do anything at any given time? That can very quickly go out of control and is just asking for trouble (for everyone honestly).\n\nI would ask for that rule to be edited with boundaries. For example: Dad's wife can ask OP to do \\[insert specific things, like housework, run to the store, laundry, dishes etc\\] on \\[insert which days she can ask this\\] with 24 hours notice (or other time frame). These tasks cannot take up more than \\[X hours\\] of time per week, and will be considerate of OP's work and school schedules.\n\nBecause honestly who knows what that one point means?

And technically, if he argued with it, he could be kicked out.", "Depends. We don't know the dad, or his relationship to the son, or the wife.  \n\n\nThe dad did say that if anything feels over-the-line with the wife to call him.

Sure the rules may suck, but it\u2019s only 6 months - it\u2019s a great deal.", "You are definitely right about the variety in rules, some of them are far more reasonable than others. However, the ones you highlight are (somewhat) less controlling then you may think.\n\nThe drug/alchohol test is bad in my eyes. Unless OP has a history of drug or alcohol abuse, it's too far for me.\n\nGoing to church is really not that bad 80% of the time, depending on the church.\n\nEverything the wife asks is the wild card. OP's SMIL may be asking for an errand a week (which is super reasonable) or for him to spend 30 minutes to save her 2 (which is crazy). It really depends on the woman's behavior.

He's going to be an adult moving into his parent's house.  They have an *obligation* to insist on rules that they feel comfortable with.  They are allowed to insist that his behaviour match their morals and values while he is staying with them. If they don't want a drunk or high person in their house, that is their right.  If they don't want strange women in their house, that is their right.  If they feel that he should not be allowed to talk about the Cardassians while in their house, that is their right.  They don't have to be reasonable in the context of anyone else's values or morality, they just have to be upfront about what they are comfortable with.\n\nHe doesn't have to accept their conditions.  He has a right to accept the deal, or refuse the deal. \n\nInstead of being an adult about it and making a decision. he's trying to get Reddit to back him up that they are being unreasonable. \n\nSomething some people missed and others didn't is that there is a lot he hasn't told us.  The dad is willing to have him move in, willing to support him by not charging rent, helping him get a second job, paying for some of his studies and providing a framework to him paying for more of his son's studies, and providing a lot of support in other areas.  That kind of parent usually doesn't default to not trusting their kid.  That kind of parent has been given a reason to not trust his kid to the extent that he wants to be able to do drug and alcohol tests.  There is a history here, and we aren't being told what that history is.\n\nApart from absolutely everything else, the dad is putting HIS name and HIS reputation on the line by getting this guy a job at his company.  Wanting to be sure the kid isn't slipping (back?) into doing drugs or alcohol in that instance isn't unreasonably controlling.  Especially since a controlling parent would try to control all aspects of their kids life, not just \"if you're living with me\".  The dad is creating incentives (big ones) for the kid to move out and ge this own place.\n\nNo, OP is hiding the reasons for many of his dad's rules.\n\nAnd besides, the Cardassians are just completely untrustworthy, ask any Bajoran.", "Church people in general are very anti-marijuana", ">The fact that his dad wants to set a condition of drug/alcohol testing at any time means there's huge mistrust there. So OP is probably an addict but didn't want to state that and color the scenario with truth.\n\n\nIDK, when my sister was a teen, my dad forced her to take drug tests. They were all negative; my sister has never done drugs or gotten in trouble with the law, but she was mouthy,  argumentative, (aka a teenager) and got a few detentions in high school (like 3 or 4) and my straight-laced, southern-Christian, military dad thought this meant she was going off the rails.

She partied too hard and got involved with some bad shit and them dropped out of college in her 3rd year, and wanted to move back in with us. (I was a freshman in high school or something.) They gave a curfew and stuff and clearly laid out what she would be responsible for paying, and said they would cut her off financially if she didn\u2019t get good grades and finish school within 2 years. That was the wake up call she needed, and she finished school, got a job, and even bought a house a few years later. (Back in 2012 you could afford to do that making $20/hr lol) \n\nConsidering he\u2019s offering to pay for classes and getting him a well paying job and even offering money for an apartment, I feel like dad really is just trying to help his son get it together and be a more responsible adult.", ">The problem is we are only getting one side \n\nVery true.  However, we are getting enough information that it's not unreasonable for us to draw some conclusions about the dad:\n\n1. He is willing to take his kid in rent free.\n2. He is willing to stick his neck out to get his kid a job.\n3. He is willing to spend his own money to help his kid study, and is willing to pay a lot more if the kid does well.\n4. He is creating incentives and opportunities for the kid to move out, but allowing him to stay as long as he follows the rules.\n\nThat kind of parent is *unlikely* to have arbitrary rules like drug tests, no friends after 8, and so on, without some kind of history showing that it is needed.

It seems excessive to me, if he has a long weekend and wants to spend it out of the house to drink, smoke, camp, or spend time with friends past 10pm he runs the risk of losing the ability to keep stuff there... because he wasn't there to disturb them?

I clean up after my dad every single day like I was a maid despite working 2 careers. Do all the groceries, as well as weeding and shit outside. I don\u2019t do the lawn though, he cuts the grass.

Quite frankly, if they never want to leave my roof, they don\u2019t have to! He\u2019s so gross for thinking being a parent ends at 18, and his wife is too for allowing that. Two sentences in and I already had problems with the parents. \n\nPlus, what if he ever needed to live with the kids?? What if THEY didn\u2019t want someone \u201cthat old\u201d living with THEM? Has he ever once thought that maybe someday HE could be the potentially-homeless one?\n\nSome of the rules, however, are understandable. I get not wanting people in your house, and I get not wanting substances consumed on your property. Very normal. \n\nBeing rent-free (and eventually being helped big-time to move out and pay for school) in exchange for taking a couple of household chores off of their hands, that\u2019s totally reasonable. \n\nBut to give an adult a curfew, not allow legal substance consumption at all to the point of forcing drug tests, force attendance to church and school, and be his wife\u2019s slave, the father is just flexing (potential) authority and lording over him.\n\nObviously, if OP has a history of recklessness, bad choices, substance abuse problems, hanging with bad crowds, etc. then this is a little less unreasonable.

I couldn\u2019t smoke weed anywhere in the house but the basement, and I couldn\u2019t light candles (open flame) or light incense (the smell gave him headaches). He never gave me a curfew, I don\u2019t think it ever even crossed his mind. He trusted me to be quiet when I got in (which I was) and lock up properly on my way in (which I did). He treated me like his child, but respected and trusted my autonomy as an adult. \n\nIn exchange for being respectful of me as a person and individual, and loving me as his child forever: he has a relationship with me, he gets to have a relationship with his grandchildren, I surprise him with just-because gifts, he gets plates when I cook meals, and if he ever needed to live with me it\u2019d 110% be a \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nOP\u2019s father seems like a very cold parent.", "I hate how people think that you can get a house at 18 if you work... like what??

If you balance the budget, no new dollar will be created, and the economy won't grow. if you have a surplus, it means you have to collect dollars out of the economy and destroy them.

Forced church attendance is bad, but not the worst imo. You have to remember that to many gen x'ers, Church helps people, if OP did indeed have substance abuse problems, his dad probably thinks going to Church will help him get better. Its 2 times a week on a day with no class, its not a huge deal. \n\n4.Running errands is fine, he even said that if he cant do it or they make him uncomfortable to call his dad which is fair. You're blowing it out of proportion that running errands will get in the way of school, too many evil stepmom posts are making you think this way. Ops step mom, dads wife, as he calls her, isn't described at all so she could be a great person. \n\n5. he said that the job would be a second job, so its likely part time.

If you can afford alcohol and weed you should probably be spending that money on rent or working instead of being drunk or high. (And I'm pro drugs) \n3. Okay fine, but 2x a month is nothing and I think 4 hours of OPs time is an okay hourly rate for free rent + classes paid for + potentially 5k. Employers make you do stuff you dont want to do all the time like \"all staff meetings\", OPs staff just includes God.\n4. OP running 1x a week errand for his wife who is likely going to be extremely inconvenienced by OP (more to clean, groceries, toliet paper, etc) is pretty reasonable.
