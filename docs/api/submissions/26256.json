It's her fault. She decided that it's smart to cheat on her husband with a 19-year-old kid.\n\nNow she is looking for a place to stay since her money will soon run out if she continues to stay cheap hostels.\n\nI 28m am the only relative that lives close to her city, an hour drive and there are options for using public transportation. I have agreed to let her stay as long as her daughter(almost 9f) doesn't step foot inside my home.\n\nHere are my reasons:\n\n1. She is a brat. If you don't give her something she will break it out of spite. She broke the snowglobe I got from Rome when I was in high school last year because I would let her play with it.\n2. She is spoiled. My sister makes her at least 2 or 3 meals because she changes her mind on what she wants and if you don't accommodate her there will be food on the floor if you are lucky if not on the walls or ceiling. Thankfully that happened in our parents home.\n3. She is just nasty. She can't wipe herself because it's dirty so my sister does it for her. That wouldn't be a problem if she stayed in the bathroom, but if my sister isn't there on time she will just walk out screaming with her pant down, sometimes leaving a trail. It's not a pretty picture.\n\nThis are the main reasons but I can list a lot more examples if you would like. And before anyone asks she's perfectly healthy, my sister made her like this since she is her little angel.\n\nMy sister is obviously mad at me for refusing to house her little angle. She says that she is a normal child and I would know if I had children. That separating a mother from her child is the cruelest thing that I could do. That it would look like she abandoned her if she does that and whatnot.\n\nI don't care. With how expensive thing are I don't have the money to replace windows and if had to be frank I think my niece would be better of with her father for a while. He might be able to parent her now.\n\nOur parents want me to take both of them in and say that they are disappointed with me. They wanted to take them in but they live 4 hours away and there is no way that my BIL would allow them to move her that far away.\n\nEdit: It seems that I wasn't clear, I apologize. My niece is staying with my BIL full time until my sister can get a safe place to live, not a hostel during tourist season", "created_utc": 1693926137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16aqm68/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_stay_in_my_home/", "score": 2780, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Somehow you are expected to be the adult.  You have no obligation to undergo this treatment.  It seems strange that your niece has not gotten therapy, but that will now be an issue for her father (because it does not seem like its a concern of her mother/your sister).", "NTA your house, you dont need to house a spoiled (and frankly gross) child in your house. If your sister doesnt like it she can find her own place to live", "My kid just turned 8. That\u2019s not normal behavior. Even for a 6 year old.", "NTA\n\nWhile I am not going to blame the kid here, clearly there are emotional issues leading to her destructive nature.  You should not be on the hook for purchasing anything she breaks.  Also, your sister can't afford to pay you, anyway.\n\nYou're being generous enough letting your sister stay there.  However, maybe your sister should stay with your parents while the kid stays with BIL.  She's just going to guilt trip you for not letting her kid stay there constantly.  And BIL might try to just dump the kid on you, anyway, if your sister  is there.", "Omg NTA, a 9yo child should be able to wipe her own ass. How does she handle things at school?\nShe seems to be very spoilt and you should stand your ground.", "NTA, but you made a mistake to let your sister stay, because if she takes you up on it she will bring the kid with her or bring her in later on.\n\nAnd your life will be hell till you throw them out.\n\nWhat is this passion that Redditors have for moving into their living quarters relatives they don't really like? Or who bring drama with them?\n\nYour sister can go live with your folks and the niece to your BIL's. After a few weeks of that, he may okay her to join her mother. Your parents are willing so that's a solution.", "It would probably be better if she stayed with her father.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to have children to know that the entire situation with your niece is *not* normal in anyway. At her age she should be more than capable of cleaning herself, and while children have their moments with bratty behavior, this beyond the occasional normal kid stuff, this is the result of years of spoiling. I hope the father is a better parent, otherwise this child is going to be a absolutely insufferable adult. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting this in your home. Your sister made her bed, let her lie in it.", "NTA.\n\nThat's not normal behavior for a 9 year old. That's lack of discipline on your sister's and BIL's part.

Sounds like both mom and daughter need to learn about the consequences to their actions lol.", "NTA\n\nNot your child, not your failed relationship, not your problem.  If the ex doesn't want her leaving town then it's his problem.\n\nDon't let either of them stay.", "Hey, if she can still complain about it then she must not need it that bad, rescind your invitation and tell her  and her brat to kick rocks.\n\nNTA", "They are NOT your responsibility!

You just know that the moment you give her and her brat a place, she will never leave.", "NTA, you're not the slave of a nine year old. Kids don't rule the world... If she can act like this without consequences I would not let her stay either... Your sister needs to learn what parenting is, otherwise your niece won't learn how the world works and it will hurt her in the long way...", "NTA \nShe made her bed, she can lie in it. Maybe some significant time away from her mom will do your neice good. Don't involve yourself in this mess of your sister's making, she can suck it up and move with her parents or rent a hotel and start working nonstop to earn her keep elsewhere. Little bit of discipline will do her good.", "Nta honestly I would not let either move in. If you let your sister stay how are you going to prevent her child from coming there. You can\u2019t trespass a child. This sounds like a legal nightmare.\n\n Tell your sister that there is no way you can help.\n\nHonestly if you let her stay within a week your neice will be there. Their will be nothing you to do to make her leave with out evicting both them. By the time you get them evicted your house would be destroyed.", "NTA.\n\n I have taken care of kids all my life, big extended family, worked in childcare,  babysat for church and choir practice,  and have 2 kids of my own. \n\nTHAT is not \"normal kid\" behavior.\nNormal is not the correct term. Common or usual might be a bit better. \nThat kid will have so many issues going into adolescence and adulthood. \n\n How does she go to school if that is her usual behavior?", "NTA\n\n \n\n>separating a mother from her child is the cruelest thing that I could do.\n\n You're not separating them.

A child who is almost 9 should be able to wipe itself. They are in either 2nd or 3rd grade by that point. \n2. It's your house. You can have who ever you want in it.\n3. If the child stayed with the dad, would mommy not be allowed to visit?\n4. She cheated on her husband with a 19 year old? Did she know the child before the cheating or was it just a hookup? Either way it's icky. \n5. She needs to teach her child responsibility. I didn't break things I couldn't play with because I couldn't have it when I was 9. I don't remember going through a phase like that at all. Should probably put the kid in therapy. This behavior is not normal. \n6. My parents had a rule of \"if you don't eat what you have on your plate, you don't get desert\" so I had to eat every meal put in front of me. This kid is so spoiled that it gets to 2-3 meals before she picks what she wants to eat. Maybe your sister would be doing a little better on money if she wasn't making so much food each night. What happens with the leftovers?\n7. If your parents are so concerned, they can house them.", "NTA", "NTA that is not normal behaivor of a child her age.  She should probably have her checked out to rules any bowels issues out.   \n\nNo one is obligated to help anyone out.  It nice people do, but not mandatory.  Also beggers can\u2019t be choosers.  It\u2019s take it or leave it!", "NTA. That situation would make your life a misery. You don't deserve to have your home disrupted, your possessions disrespected and broken.", "NTA because it sounds like everyone is leaning on you to rescue your sister from her stupid actions. I dont see her taking steps to improve her life if shes livibg with family. Your niece is currently with her father, which might be the best place for her right now. Give your sister contact info for social services and some local organizations that help women in finding housing. My hope is that having a caseworker will make her be more accountable.", "nta. let the op parents take them..", "NTA.  You are fully entitled to exclude anyone from your property that you do not want there.  It is none of your parent\u2019s business so they can keep their opinions and noses out.  Your sister created her own problem so it\u2019s up to her to sort out.  She\u2019s 32 so time for her to adult and accept that her kids a brat and if you say no then that\u2019s end of story with no argument.", "NTS Your sister created her mess, let her figure it out.", "Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t let your sister move in either.  She is going to be a nightmare. Let her get a job maybe and her own place. Let her go stay with parents and get a job and save up to move back.  \n\nShe is a grown ass adult who has blown up her own life. You are not responsible for helping her fix it.", "Let them be disappointed. That\u2019s better than a completely destroyed home, done by a 9 year old.

I\u2019m going to make a few assumptions, so please forgive me if I\u2019m wrong. First, I\u2019ll bet your place just isn\u2019t set up for 2 adults and a kid for any length of time. Two, taking on the drama of your sister mid-divorce is tough, but if she needs to get more/better work - then you would likely be also take on child care if her daughter comes. Can you take that on? Finally, regardless of it\u2019s just your sister or her and her child, they are entering your home. You get to create expectations and rules regarding responsibilities, privacy, communication, and consequences. It\u2019s not always easy, but sometimes showing love is tough, it\u2019s not always saying \u2018yes\u2019. . . And just because someone in your life is going through hell, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re obligated to join them.", "NTA. I made the mistake of welcoming my best friend and goddaughter into my home. My best friend was never present and my husband and I are presently doing most of the parenting of her daughter which we\u2019re fed up with. I love my goddaughter I really do, she\u2019s not even as bad as your niece. It\u2019s a lot taking on a kid that\u2019s not your own. We don\u2019t regret it because I know my goddaughter will appreciate it when she\u2019s older. She\u2019s starting to figure out her mom is a shitty mom which I only found out when they started living with me. Barely ever here and pawning her daughter off on us and anyone else. They\u2019re leaving this month because my husband and I blew up that she\u2019s taken advantage of the situation completely. She hasn\u2019t paid us back for anything. Our friendship isn\u2019t as stable as it once was. I still think she\u2019s a good person. Just a shitty mom. People can be multiple things. I think you need to protect yourself first. Protecting yourself first would standing your ground on your belief.

Not your fault, not your job to fix. People with dogs and/or children who aren't house broken have a hard time finding accommodations.", "NTA.\n\nYour home, your rules, and you're offering her a favor.

You're not responsible for her and I wouldn't let that monster in my home either.", "Oh dear god, no, NTA!  \nAnd that is NOT normal behaviour especially for a 9 yo!", "She can't wipe herself. OMG\n\nNo you're NTA", "NTA", "Hold your own.  Don\u2019t let anyone move in, and send your BIL a link to this post.  This child needs stability and boundaries, and your sister has neither of those.

Kids can regress and behave very weirdly when a parent discourages them from doing anything themselves. It sounds like it would be best for them to be separated for a while. Her dad isn't going to wipe her bum.", "Wtaf. What does she do if she has a crap at school?", "NTA. I just can't get over a 9 yo not being able to use the bathroom by herself. Plus, the picky eating and meltdowns are really concerning behavior. \nYour sister seems unfit as a parent so I wouldn't risk having her in my house especially after having an affair with a barely legal kid.

Frankly OP, If I were in your shoes I wouldn't get involved in that situation AT ALL.\n\nNo, scratch that; this child should be removed from her mother's custody and put into a mental health facility; she's violent, dangerous, and she's going to end up injuring someone at some point if she's allowed to keep on the way she's going.

I have four children ranging from just under 2 to 18. None of them act this way. My 3 year old doesn't act this way. So no your sister is wrong, that's now how children act that's how her child acts. I also don't allow some people's children at my home due to their behavior. If they can't learn to act properly then they don't get to be certain places- it's called consequences.", "NTA\n\nThe kid is his/her parent's responsibility and should stay with them if possible. From what you're saying both parents are 'healthy' enough to take care of her. Now she's staying with her dad - what's wrong with it? She's his child. Only when the parents are dysfunctional, should someone else take care of a child. \n\nSo many people don't understand that if someone else agrees to give you a place to stay you have to follow their rules. It is difficult, especially for spoiled kids and equally entitled parents.", "NTA\n\nI'm a parent to a 4 year old and he behaves better than you are describing this 9 year old. 9 is no excuse to not be fully potty trained including wiping herself. That's just your sister being a negligent parent. And I'm sorry if that comes off as rude or inappropriate. \n\nThe daughter does need to be with her father if that's how the mother is raising her. I would rescind your offer to your sister if she is not willing to agree to your terms for YOUR home.", "NTA\n\nBut your niece isnt a nasty spoiled brat she for sure has a mental illness that needs immediate attention.", "NTA. I raised three children. You are right, your niece is a poorly raised brat. Her behavior is NOT normal. If I were you I wouldn't let my sister stay either. She has already allowed her daughter to trash your things and then she dismisses your concerns. Let her look into public housing/low income services or help for battered women. Or if your parents are willing to help, she can move there. If it's her only option her husband cannot prevent it. In fact the courts will not look kindly on him for kicking her out. He is not allowed to do that. By law she must be allowed to stay there. She should get a lawyer or contact legal aid to get back into the house and have him leave until the divorce is settled.", "This is heartbreaking.\n\nThis is not typical 9-year-old behaviour.  I don't know of any typical kids, even badly parented ones, who behave in this manner.  This little girl needs more than better parenting.\n\nYou're not the right person to assist, clearly, and it's good that you recognize it.  NTA for refusing.\n\nIdeally your sister should get this little girl assessed, so that you both have a better picture of what's going on.  You would be kind to assist your sister in this, if you are able. I have a feeling that neither your sister's belief that she's normal, nor your belief that she's simply a brat, are the complete and correct story.  If I'm wrong, I'll be glad, but someone needs to check it out. The sooner she seeks the facts, whatever they turn out to be, and the sooner you both face reality, the better the outcomes will be for this little girl.", "NTA.

She needs behavioral therapy.", "NTA\n\nyour niece has behavioral issues and she needs therapy. this is not normal behavior for a child. children who habitually \"act out\" do so when some need isn't being met.", "Stuff like this isn't really....a parenting issue. I mean sort of, but when it gets this bad it becomes something beyond what your run of the mill \"discipline\" would fix. She needs care.", "Yes, she does need therapy because her behavior is not normal.", "Info: Does BIL ever try to discipline her? If yes, how does that usually go for him?", "I just thought of Veruca Salt from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...", "You'll meet your special one, just wait. And you shouldn't be forced to cope with your niece's behavior. As for your parents, you should explain your reasons, if they don't get what you're expressing then don't tell them anything else. You did what you could. \n\nAs for your sister, as a woman, I'm ashamed. She shouldn't be expecting everyone thinking like her that her kiddo is \"special.\" I'm 20 y/o and my nephew and nice, both of them know how to behave. They're 9 and 6. I hope everything goes better for you.", "That party sounds like it was a lot of fun!", "This does NOT sound like Autism **in GIRLS**.\n\nIt *could* be symptomatic of Autism in *boys*.\n\nThere is a vast difference.", "Does it not sound like she\u2019s possibly autistic though? \n\nMultiple meals \u2014 children with autism often struggle with texture.  Not to mention her throwing it everywhere when she\u2019s upset with what she\u2019s been made. \nNot being able to wipe herself \u2014 sensory processing.  \nBreaking things \u2014 some of them are often violent/aggressive. \n\nIt just screams autism to me.  In which case I feel so sorry for this child if she has gone all this time undiagnosed.", "In 12 years of school  I only went like 4 times lol. I hated using those toilets", "Every kid is different. I started holding my pee (and poop) all day at school since I was in half-day kindergarten, and continued all the way through high school. The only time I used the bathroom was in high school when it was my period and needed to change my pad.   \n\n\nI've had two kids, and my bladder still works great. I can still hold it all night long, and I don't have urinary incontinence like many other women after child birth. I'm almost 40.  \n\n\nI figure if holding my pee all day was going to cause problems, it would have already. I apparently just have a big bladder, or something.", ">What child would do any of these things passed the toddler stage? \n\nA child who has been abused.   \n\n\nThat may not be the case, but it's a possibility. When I was still teaching full-time, we were told that the victims of child abuse sometimes react in this way.  \n\n\nI recall that we had one pupil at high school who refused to wash herself. She constantly had hair lice. It turned out that it's a way of deterring further abuse. (At least that's what social work and the educational psychologist told us.)", "Honestly, this would be the best for OP because  her sister will continue to complain about her \u201dlittle angel\u201c not  being allowed to live with her and would prob start bringing her daughter over against OP\u2019s objections. The grandparents are just as bad as the sister for enabling the child\u2019s behavior.", "Nah, she just hold the poop in until she gets home.  \n\nSome kids do this because of all sorts of reasons.", "[deleted]", "Dude, she's 9. She's barely formed up there, calm down.", "That may be a good mid to long term solution, anyway. At least until her dad can teach her to properly use the bathroom.", "Sounds like she should not have slept with a 19 year old, then. That's gross in itself.", "Which is probably where the sister learned to parent a spoiled brat", "Dude the parents are 4 hours away... Thats not exactly \"go over there every other weekend\" kind of distance.", "Not necessarily. I had a niece that didn't wipe herself until 3rd grade. If she was at school she would go to the nurse to call her nanny to come to the school to wipe her butt. I refused after 4 and I was told I was not right for refusing. But I had 2 kids that I made learn and I sure as heck wasn't enabling a child that had no disability.", "There was a kid in my family that wouldn't do it to this extreme, but they were 8 and still refusing because it was \"dirty.\" Eventually his mom got sick of it and said she wasn't doing it anymore, either he walks around gross or he learns. He learned. Pretty fast, actually.", "I know someone who\u2019s kid just started 3rd grade and she still wipes her kids ass! She has her kid in private school and I think this may have something to do with it. Some people are sick!", ">Hard to say the dad is a shitty parent\n\nNot hard at all, this kid is his responsibility too, if he let things get to this point, that's as much on him as it's on the mother. Keep in mind that he's not divorcing because she's a bad mom, it was the cheating that caused the breakup, not disagreements on parenting", "He said he's not from the US so that doesn't apply here.", "Yeah, I know a 13 year old that still has \"trouble\" with it.\n\nAnd no, she has no disabilities. She's just shitty. (In more ways than one.)", "It's possible the 7 year old has a disability you aren't aware of.", "My kids private school said right out they don\u2019t wipe butts in school.  If the kid poops their pants, they have spare clothes and parents get called to pick them up.  It happens more than a handful of times and the school says \u2018goodbye\u2019 to you.  Most private schools actually WON\u2019T do anything for kids in terms of toileting.  It goes into possible accusation territory.", "It is possible though. When I was in elementary school there was a boy in my class who actually did the same thing OP's niece was described as doing. Trust me, it's not a pretty sight nor does it smell okay. It became such a problem my teacher even had to get the principal to watch him or help him since she got fed up and his parents weren't doing anything.", "Further in the comments the poster I replied to was calling the dad shitty for making his daughter homeless, when OP has clarified that that wasn't the case. That was what motivated most of my comment tbh.", "The daughter currently lives with BIL. The BIL is saying that his ex can\u2019t have any living arrangements with the kid until she\u2019s in a stable and safe home. The ex pretty obviously isn\u2019t going to be satisfied with just visitation until they\u2019re in a stable environment since they can\u2019t handle living with OP temporarily without the kid there.", "It's possible, my brother wasn't allowed to discipline either of his daughter's and when he did the mothers would tell him to mind his own business and then tell their daughter's to ignore anything that he said. So, yes I believe that the bil could indeed not be the shitty parent", "Well, from the post it seems in this case the mother isn't the better parent.", "RAD is difficult. Most children with it didn\u2019t have proper maternal bond within first 5 years of life. Met my husband and he was a single daddy with sole custody of two children because his ex wife cheated on him and completely abandoned their two children. When we met oldest (m) was 5 and youngest (f) was 3. He was an awesome dad but youngest was diagnosed with RAD due to lack of proper maternal bond and attachment. It was difficult and we were in therapy for a long time. If it is ignored the child will grow up and the attachment disorder can and most likely will turn into a personality disorder\u2026", ">I think they are just trying to keep the family together so they bow down to the wife\n\nOr maybe it's just that belief that women are responsible for childcare, as they are not as responsible for the kid as the woman"]}
