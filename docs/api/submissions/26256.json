It's her fault. She decided that it's smart to cheat on her husband with a 19-year-old kid.\r  \nNow she is looking for a place to stay since her money will soon run out if she continues to stay cheap hostels.\r  \nI 28m am the only relative that lives close to her city, an hour drive and there are options for using public transportation. I have agreed to let her stay as long as her daughter(almost 9f) doesn't step foot inside my home. \r  \nHere are my reasons:\r  \n1. She is a brat. If you don't give her something she will break it out of spite. She broke the snowglobe I got from Rome when I was in high school last year because I would let her play with it.\r  \n2. She is spoiled. My sister makes her at least 2 or 3 meals because she changes her mind on what she wants and if you don't accommodate her there will be food on the floor if you are lucky if not on the walls or ceiling. Thankfully that happened in our parents home.\r  \n3. She is just nasty. She can't wipe herself because it's dirty so my sister does it for her. That wouldn't be a problem if she stayed in the bathroom, but if my sister isn't there on time she will just walk out screaming with her pant down, sometimes leaving a trail. It's not a pretty picture.\r  \nThis are the main reasons but I can list a lot more examples if you would like. And before anyone asks she's perfectly healthy, my sister made her like this since she is her little angel.\r  \nMy sister is obviously mad at me for refusing to house her little angle. She says that she is a normal child and I would know if I had children. That separating a mother from her child is the cruelest thing that I could do. That it would look like she abandoned her if she does that and whatnot.\r  \nI don't care. With how expensive thing are I don't have the money to replace windows and if had to be frank I think my niece would be better of with her father for a while. He might be able to parent her now. \r  \nOur parents want me to take both of them in and say that they are disappointed with me. They wanted to take them in but they live 4 hours away and there is no way that my BIL would allow them to move her that far away.", "created_utc": 1693926137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16aqm68/aita_for_not_letting_my_niece_stay_in_my_home/", "score": 848, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are they homeschooled?", "NTA.\n\nHowever, I think the answer should be that neither of them move in.  \nIf you let her move in then she may be really hard to get rid of.", "NTA\n\nIt's your home and the situation your sister is in is apparently her own fault.  Somehow you are expected to be the adult.  You have no obligation to undergo this treatment.  It seems strange that your niece has not gotten therapy, but that will now be an issue for her father (because it does not seem like its a concern of her mother/your sister).", "NTA your house, you dont need to house a spoiled (and frankly gross) child in your house. If your sister doesnt like it she can find her own place to live", "My kid just turned 8. That\u2019s not normal behavior. Even for a 6 year old.", "NTA\n\nWhile I am not going to blame the kid here, clearly there are emotional issues leading to her destructive nature.  You should not be on the hook for purchasing anything she breaks.  Also, your sister can't afford to pay you, anyway.\n\nYou're being generous enough letting your sister stay there.  However, maybe your sister should stay with your parents while the kid stays with BIL.  She's just going to guilt trip you for not letting her kid stay there constantly.  And BIL might try to just dump the kid on you, anyway, if your sister  is there.", "Omg NTA, a 9yo child should be able to wipe her own ass. How does she handle things at school?\nShe seems to be very spoilt and you should stand your ground.", "NTA, but you made a mistake to let your sister stay, because if she takes you up on it she will bring the kid with her or bring her in later on.\n\nAnd your life will be hell till you throw them out.\n\nWhat is this passion that Redditors have for moving into their living quarters relatives they don't really like? Or who bring drama with them?\n\nYour sister can go live with your folks and the niece to your BIL's. After a few weeks of that, he may okay her to join her mother. Your parents are willing so that's a solution.", "It would probably be better if she stayed with her father.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to have children to know that the entire situation with your niece is *not* normal in anyway. At her age she should be more than capable of cleaning herself, and while children have their moments with bratty behavior, this beyond the occasional normal kid stuff, this is the result of years of spoiling. I hope the father is a better parent, otherwise this child is going to be a absolutely insufferable adult. I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting this in your home. Your sister made her bed, let her lie in it.", "NTA.\n\nThat's not normal behavior for a 9 year old. That's lack of discipline on your sister's and BIL's part.

That is where she should stay. I cannot accommodate her or sister.\" Rinse and repeat. NTA.", "NTA you shouldn\u2019t feel bad that you\u2019re helping her out at your own capacity. If you were allowed to discipline her daughter when she broke rules or threw tantrums then maybe but I\u2019m sure trying to do that would bring on more problems. Sounds like both mom and daughter need to learn about the consequences to their actions lol.", "NTA\n\nNot your child, not your failed relationship, not your problem.  If the ex doesn't want her leaving town then it's his problem.\n\nDon't let either of them stay.", "Hey, if she can still complain about it then she must not need it that bad, rescind your invitation and tell her  and her brat to kick rocks.\n\nNTA", "They are NOT your responsibility!

And you would have a hell of a job getting them out?", "NTA, your sister needs to find a place asap. You just know that the moment you give her and her brat a place, she will never leave.", "NTA, you're not the slave of a nine year old. Kids don't rule the world... If she can act like this without consequences I would not let her stay either... Your sister needs to learn what parenting is, otherwise your niece won't learn how the world works and it will hurt her in the long way...", "NTA \nShe made her bed, she can lie in it. Maybe some significant time away from her mom will do your neice good. Don't involve yourself in this mess of your sister's making, she can suck it up and move with her parents or rent a hotel and start working nonstop to earn her keep elsewhere. Little bit of discipline will do her good.", "Nta honestly I would not let either move in. If you let your sister stay how are you going to prevent her child from coming there. You can\u2019t trespass a child. This sounds like a legal nightmare.\n\n Tell your sister that there is no way you can help.\n\nHonestly if you let her stay within a week your neice will be there. Their will be nothing you to do to make her leave with out evicting both them. By the time you get them evicted your house would be destroyed.", "NTA.\n\n I have taken care of kids all my life, big extended family, worked in childcare,  babysat for church and choir practice,  and have 2 kids of my own. \n\nTHAT is not \"normal kid\" behavior.\nNormal is not the correct term. Common or usual might be a bit better. \nThat kid will have so many issues going into adolescence and adulthood. \n\n How does she go to school if that is her usual behavior?", "NTA\n\n \n\n>separating a mother from her child is the cruelest thing that I could do.\n\n You're not separating them.

A child who is almost 9 should be able to wipe itself. They are in either 2nd or 3rd grade by that point. \n2. It's your house. You can have who ever you want in it.\n3. If the child stayed with the dad, would mommy not be allowed to visit?\n4. She cheated on her husband with a 19 year old? Did she know the child before the cheating or was it just a hookup? Either way it's icky. \n5. She needs to teach her child responsibility. I didn't break things I couldn't play with because I couldn't have it when I was 9. I don't remember going through a phase like that at all. Should probably put the kid in therapy. This behavior is not normal. \n6. My parents had a rule of \"if you don't eat what you have on your plate, you don't get desert\" so I had to eat every meal put in front of me. This kid is so spoiled that it gets to 2-3 meals before she picks what she wants to eat. Maybe your sister would be doing a little better on money if she wasn't making so much food each night. What happens with the leftovers?\n7. If your parents are so concerned, they can house them.", "NTA", "NTA that is not normal behaivor of a child her age.  She should probably have her checked out to rules any bowels issues out.   \n\nNo one is obligated to help anyone out.  It nice people do, but not mandatory.  Also beggers can\u2019t be choosers.  It\u2019s take it or leave it!", "NTA. That situation would make your life a misery. You don't deserve to have your home disrupted, your possessions disrespected and broken.", "NTA because it sounds like everyone is leaning on you to rescue your sister from her stupid actions. I dont see her taking steps to improve her life if shes livibg with family. Your niece is currently with her father, which might be the best place for her right now. Give your sister contact info for social services and some local organizations that help women in finding housing. My hope is that having a caseworker will make her be more accountable.", "nta. let the op parents take them..", "NTA.  You are fully entitled to exclude anyone from your property that you do not want there.  It is none of your parent\u2019s business so they can keep their opinions and noses out.  Your sister created her own problem so it\u2019s up to her to sort out.  She\u2019s 32 so time for her to adult and accept that her kids a brat and if you say no then that\u2019s end of story with no argument.", "NTS Your sister created her mess, let her figure it out.", "Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t let your sister move in either.  She is going to be a nightmare. Let her get a job maybe and her own place. Let her go stay with parents and get a job and save up to move back.  \n\nShe is a grown ass adult who has blown up her own life. You are not responsible for helping her fix it.", "Let them be disappointed. That\u2019s better than a completely destroyed home, done by a 9 year old. And mom is not paying for damages because she is a normal child it\u2019s what they do. NTA", "NTA - although you\u2019re messaging could have been better. I\u2019m going to make a few assumptions, so please forgive me if I\u2019m wrong. First, I\u2019ll bet your place just isn\u2019t set up for 2 adults and a kid for any length of time. Two, taking on the drama of your sister mid-divorce is tough, but if she needs to get more/better work - then you would likely be also take on child care if her daughter comes. Can you take that on? Finally, regardless of it\u2019s just your sister or her and her child, they are entering your home. You get to create expectations and rules regarding responsibilities, privacy, communication, and consequences. It\u2019s not always easy, but sometimes showing love is tough, it\u2019s not always saying \u2018yes\u2019. . . And just because someone in your life is going through hell, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re obligated to join them.", "NTA. I made the mistake of welcoming my best friend and goddaughter into my home. My best friend was never present and my husband and I are presently doing most of the parenting of her daughter which we\u2019re fed up with. I love my goddaughter I really do, she\u2019s not even as bad as your niece. It\u2019s a lot taking on a kid that\u2019s not your own. We don\u2019t regret it because I know my goddaughter will appreciate it when she\u2019s older. She\u2019s starting to figure out her mom is a shitty mom which I only found out when they started living with me. Barely ever here and pawning her daughter off on us and anyone else. They\u2019re leaving this month because my husband and I blew up that she\u2019s taken advantage of the situation completely. She hasn\u2019t paid us back for anything. Our friendship isn\u2019t as stable as it once was. I still think she\u2019s a good person. Just a shitty mom. People can be multiple things. I think you need to protect yourself first. Protecting yourself first would standing your ground on your belief. She can still visit her daughter at her dads but if she wants to live with her daughter she needs to live elsewhere", "Your house your rules.", "NTA,  I wouldn't want your niece in my home either yikes \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA - she is absolutely not a normal child!", "NTA. Not your fault, not your job to fix. People with dogs and/or children who aren't house broken have a hard time finding accommodations.", "NTA.\n\nYour home, your rules, and you're offering her a favor.  Either she can take it or leave it.  Let the kid stay with dad, or she can find somewhere else.  You're not responsible for her and I wouldn't let that monster in my home either.", "Oh dear god, no, NTA!  \nAnd that is NOT normal behaviour especially for a 9 yo!", "She can't wipe herself. OMG\n\nNo you're NTA", "NTA", "Hold your own.  Don\u2019t let anyone move in, and send your BIL a link to this post.  This child needs stability and boundaries, and your sister has neither of those.  NTA.  BIL needs to go for full custody.", "NTA. The toilet issue in particular is seriously abnormal. Kids can regress and behave very weirdly when a parent discourages them from doing anything themselves. It sounds like it would be best for them to be separated for a while. Her dad isn't going to wipe her bum.", "Wtaf. What does she do if she has a crap at school?", "NTA. I just can't get over a 9 yo not being able to use the bathroom by herself. Plus, the picky eating and meltdowns are really concerning behavior. \nYour sister seems unfit as a parent so I wouldn't risk having her in my house especially after having an affair with a barely legal kid. This is a mess all around and I would stay clear of both.", "NTA. Your sister may move to your parents\u2019s house if they disagree with your reasons", "That.  Is A Lot.  Wow.  Um.  Frankly OP, If I were in your shoes I wouldn't get involved in that situation AT ALL.\n\nNo, scratch that; this child should be removed from her mother's custody and put into a mental health facility; she's violent, dangerous, and she's going to end up injuring someone at some point if she's allowed to keep on the way she's going.  I'd call CPS on your sister and her spouse, and then cut off contact with the whole family afterwards.", "Do Not Let Either of them stay with you.

I have four children ranging from just under 2 to 18. None of them act this way. My 3 year old doesn't act this way. So no your sister is wrong, that's now how children act that's how her child acts. I also don't allow some people's children at my home due to their behavior. If they can't learn to act properly then they don't get to be certain places- it's called consequences.", "NTA\n\nThe kid is his/her parent's responsibility and should stay with them if possible. From what you're saying both parents are 'healthy' enough to take care of her. Now she's staying with her dad - what's wrong with it? She's his child. Only when the parents are dysfunctional, should someone else take care of a child. \n\nSo many people don't understand that if someone else agrees to give you a place to stay you have to follow their rules. It is difficult, especially for spoiled kids and equally entitled parents.", "NTA\n\nI'm a parent to a 4 year old and he behaves better than you are describing this 9 year old. 9 is no excuse to not be fully potty trained including wiping herself. That's just your sister being a negligent parent. And I'm sorry if that comes off as rude or inappropriate. \n\nThe daughter does need to be with her father if that's how the mother is raising her. I would rescind your offer to your sister if she is not willing to agree to your terms for YOUR home.", "NTA\n\nBut your niece isnt a nasty spoiled brat she for sure has a mental illness that needs immediate attention.", "NTA. I raised three children. You are right, your niece is a poorly raised brat. Her behavior is NOT normal. If I were you I wouldn't let my sister stay either. She has already allowed her daughter to trash your things and then she dismisses your concerns. Let her look into public housing/low income services or help for battered women. Or if your parents are willing to help, she can move there. If it's her only option her husband cannot prevent it. In fact the courts will not look kindly on him for kicking her out. He is not allowed to do that. By law she must be allowed to stay there. She should get a lawyer or contact legal aid to get back into the house and have him leave until the divorce is settled.", "This is heartbreaking.\n\nThis is not typical 9-year-old behaviour.  I don't know of any typical kids, even badly parented ones, who behave in this manner.  This little girl needs more than better parenting.\n\nYou're not the right person to assist, clearly, and it's good that you recognize it.  NTA for refusing.\n\nIdeally your sister should get this little girl assessed, so that you both have a better picture of what's going on.  You would be kind to assist your sister in this, if you are able. I have a feeling that neither your sister's belief that she's normal, nor your belief that she's simply a brat, are the complete and correct story.  If I'm wrong, I'll be glad, but someone needs to check it out. The sooner she seeks the facts, whatever they turn out to be, and the sooner you both face reality, the better the outcomes will be for this little girl.", "NTA.

I wouldn't have tolerated it from my son or my daughter at *4*.\n\nI've seen so many other parents being absolutely ridiculous with their kids that I can believe it, though. I've been yelled at so many times for things like telling my nephew that he's not allowed to hit me that I just avoid him altogether when possible, and he had some similar things going on with mom wiping his butt up until 5-6. And one of our friends told us about holding her son's penis for him while he peed...he was 3 or so but still wtf.", "You act like most students aren't holding it, more so the older they are. It's very normal, especially when you have a predictable schedule.", "Exactly!!! She\u2019s just a spoilt kid. Her parents haven\u2019t done a great job raising her.", "I don't know and that is my point. No diagnosis or no school file indicating behavioral issues means we just don't \"know\" what the deal is. Behavioral issues have roots and its absurd to blame an untrained child for their behavioral problems, just like you wouldn't blame an untrained dog for soiling the carpets. The responsibility lies with the trainer, after all. But, behavioral problems still have roots. Sometimes those roots are medical and sometimes they are emotional or environmental.", "You mean the uncle/brother. OP is male", "Op is male", "She is with him until my sister can find a safe place to stay, but she can't afford rent + living expences on her salary", "No, because this story is clearly made up. It just happens to push all the buttons for a successful AITA post. Family imposition, complaining about how someone else has raised a child and cheating is a classic of the genre.", "Custody should be in favour of the kid. While with the mother they have to stay at a hotel or wherever... but with the father the kid has her own bedroom and a stable parent. Which one is better?", "It probably would require a relocation hearing. Depends on the interests of the child, custody / visitation arrangements, and if a parent is going to face homelessness or absolutely needs to move. It's not impossible, especially if BIL can't prove that the child is best staying where they are.", "But I also wouldn\u2019t want my daughter not knowing where she will sleep either so it\u2019s either he takes her or she goes to the only other place where she can have suitable shelter and as a father she should not be struggling because of a divorce", "Plus it just takes one false accusation from demon child and OP is hosed legally.", "Agree. I hated the school toilets so I avoided them.  Never had a problem with \u201cholding\u201d bowel-movements because I didn\u2019t have the urge until after dinner unless I was ill.  I did hold off peeing more than I should have, perhaps, but I never had any problems.\n\nHowever, this kid has got Problems and should be under treatment if she can\u2019t/won\u2019t wipe herself.", "I don't think people are blaming the girl.  They are blaming the mother (and the father to an extent) for not raising and disciplining the girl.  The consequence of this is the girl is someone the OP does not want to be around or have in the home.", "Yeah, I know some people whose kid just never attached properly. Even at 1, he was perfectly happy to just walk straight away from mom, run out into the street, etc. Weird thing and very stressful.\n\nNow he's 3 and he's fucking feral, he shits in the neighbor's yard and can only kind of say maybe 5 words.\n\nIs there probably some inherent developmental issue? Yes. Is he much worse because his mom ignores him and treats him like an animal? Yes. Could you make a realistic treatment plan that didn't involve dealing with both sides? No.", "Doesn't matter. The mother has to take responsibility. That kid is not OP, 's problem!\n..", "Just for clarity, the OP is the brother.", "from what you\u2019ve said I wouldn\u2019t want your sister living with me either", "Sounds like her daughter is in the right place for her.  Hang tight!", "If she's with her dad, why are your parents ragging on you to take them in? She's in the best place right now.", "That is not your problem. Why doesn't she take the kid and move in with the 19 year old.", "Once she is a legal resident of your home, she will bring the devils spawn in.", "So, if you let your sister live with you, she will never leave because she wouldn't be able to afford to. That would be a hard \"no\" from me, especially when you know that she will never let up about letting her kid in your house.", "I bet, for BIL it's always better when the kid stays with her mom, as he probably doesn't want to handle the kid, if it is behaving like OP described.", "Unfortunately, that rarely matters. Most states are mommy states and it takes soooo much to get the kid out of a shitty situation", "Blame both the parents. They made this problem together.", "Could be RAD ( reactive attachment disorder) which is when a child doesn\u2019t properly form healthy attachments to their caregivers, and caused behavioral problems, and emotional control problems. ( it\u2019s caused by neglect and abuse at a early age)", ">he was perfectly happy to just walk straight away from mom, run out into the street, etc. Weird thing and very stressful.\n\nThat's classic symptoms of autism.  Normally it starts when they're 2-3ish. \n\nMaybe the child should be taken away from the mom? It's not going to get better.", "I wouldn\u2019t either.  Even if she doesn\u2019t try to move the kid in, they will definitely be over to visit and can still cause damage.  I don\u2019t know what the mom\u2019s game plan is.  At what age was she going to stop wiping her kid? 13? 16? Follow her to work? Awkward\u2026 This is kid is being set up to fail in life.", "Probably because the 19 year old\u2019s mommy & daddy won\u2019t let them!", ">( it\u2019s caused by neglect and abuse at a early age)\n\nAt one point they blamed women for Autism.  The called them \"refrigerator mom's\"  and claimed the women didn't love the children enough.   Now Autism is a real diagnosis and we understand it's a form of brain damage.\n\nThe older the mom when she gave birth, the higher the chance of having a child with genetic damage.\n\nYou sound like you know your stuff. I'm just uncomfortable blaming women for what might be a birth defect.", "We're on the second call to child services. I don't want to put a kid in the system but hopefully they can persuade her to get help.", "We can all picture the post for that one!!", "If I dated a 30something woman when I was 19, my mom would probably beat me over the head with a broom \ud83d\ude05. If his parents know they definitely aren't happy with him", "Yep!"]}
