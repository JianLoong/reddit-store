{"id": 29781, "submission_id": "17hlxs4", "title": "AITA for keeping the money my ex sent me when we were together?", "selftext": "When I (30F) was in grad school I was dating John (42M) long distance. I often struggled with money as an underpaid grad student, but with the help of my parents I made it work. During my relationship with John, when we would be fighting or generally not getting along, he started sending me chunks of money ($400-500) randomly. I would ask what for and he would say things like \u201cjust to help you with your bills.\u201d At first I would immediately send it back. He was well off and I didn\u2019t want him to think that I was using him for his money. After a while I started to notice that he always did it when we were fighting and got suspicious of his intentions. One day, he sent $500 and I didn\u2019t immediately send it back. Sure enough, about 30 minutes later he asks \u201cWell, are you going to send it back?\u201d I ask \u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t you send it to help me with bills?\u201d And he starts getting mad and saying things like \u201cWhy do you think you deserve it? You didn\u2019t earn that money.\u201d To which I replied \u201cThen why did you send it?\u201d With that, he confirmed my suspicions: he was sending the money not to actually help me, but to make it LOOK like he was helping me to get brownie points and do some sort of loyalty test. So I told him \u201cLook. I\u2019ll send it back. But don\u2019t ever send me money unsolicited again. If you do, I will keep it. I\u2019m tired of you testing me. If you don\u2019t want me to have it, don\u2019t send it.\u201d That stopped it for about a year. Then fast forward, another period where we aren\u2019t getting along and I was mostly ignoring his calls and texts. Eventually he gets his friend to call me and they\u2019re talking about stuff and casually mention that he sent me some money. I check my PayPal and he\u2019d sent $2,000. I ask why and he says \u201cI know you\u2019re struggling. It\u2019s to help with bills and stuff.\u201d Furious that he\u2019d done it again, I decided to teach him an expensive lesson. I didn\u2019t send it back. Sure enough, about an hour later he starts freaking out. He asked why I wasn\u2019t sending it back and why I thought I deserved it. I reminded him over and over of the last time: how I\u2019d told him if he did it again, I would keep it and use it for bills. This made him furious. He threatened to break up with me, never talk to me again, etc. After a while of me not budging, he seemingly let it go. Well, we\u2019ve since broken up for other reasons but remained friends in some capacity. I hadn\u2019t thought about the money again until last night when he brought it up during a phone call. I reiterated that I had told him I would keep it and I was sick of him \u201ctesting my loyalty\u201d with money and that I was tired of him trying to manipulate me into thinking he was helping me when he had no intentions of actually helping me. He confirmed that he never intended for me to keep the money, which to me confirmed it was all about manipulation. He was mad I stuck to my guns and hung up on me but I don\u2019t care. I think he needed that very expensive lesson to learn to stop trying to manipulate people with money.

Unless he was announcing this stupid gesture to anyone and everyone that would listen to earn the brownie points with them, he was aiming to earn them with you. He won 2,000 of them, he doesn\u2019t get to reclaim them after the fact or they don\u2019t count and actually removes more than he\u2019s reclaiming. You be happy with the cash, he can be happy with his points.\n\nYou told him to stop or the only thing he\u2019d get back are the points he so desperately sought. NTA. You were loyal - to your word. Good job!", "No. He gave it to you.", "NTA, also I noticed two things in your story.\n\n1: I think you might have a hard time receiving things. When men usually send money to their girlfriend, it\u2019s not a \u201cwill she send it back mind game\u201d, but rather a genuine gesture of wanting to provide for you. Is it uncomfortable for you to accept gifts from others? In this scenario I\u2019d just say \u201cyou know you don\u2019t have to do this, but thank you so much. You\u2019re the best!\u201d\n\n2: Firstly, he is a breed I have never seen before. He is 42 and so childish and manipulative ( but the stupid kind ). The audacity this man has is NUTS. At his age he should have wife, kids, mortgage, etc to take care of and he is acting like helping his gf out with bills is a crazy thing to do. You\u2019re better off without him\u2026 \n\nAnd perhaps you should reflect on what attracted you to him.", "Do you really need to ask? NTA. You gave him fair warning and he didn't listen. Good for you for sticking to your guns and good for you for distancing yourself from such a manipulative AH. I'm surprised you even stayed friends.", "Totally NTA. That\u2019s is penalty for fucking around and finding out. \n\nAlso, block his number. He\u2019s not your friend. He\u2019s not going to change.", "NTA. But what a weird game to play. My (now) husband used to be a \"throw money at it\" problem solver. But I always kept it and never sent it back. And he never expected me to. He genuinely thought money solved most problems.", "This is ridiculous. It\u2019s your money by his choice. People don\u2019t gift money to people and expect it back. Or they shouldn\u2019t. Either way NTA.", "NTA stupid games, stupid prizes", "NTA, but I think you will be if you continue to be friends with this guy. He's 42. This is just embarrassing for him.", "NTA - but weird as hell given it often costs money to send receive money depending on how lomg distance, currency and method.", "What an arse of a man this guy is. Defo NTA.", "NTA- lol I would never in a million years return money gifted to me. Buh yourself something luxurious for having to put up with his childishness.", "you\u2019re the asshole for still talking to this guy oh my fucking god. grow a spine and block him. \n\nESH", "Yes.
