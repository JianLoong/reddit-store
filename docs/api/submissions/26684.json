As a boss, you need to be extremely careful about socializing with employees especially when you aren't including everyone.

You created a situation where all the women are excluded.

This kind of confirmation bias is why you are the asshole.\n\nThe fact that you know it's only men and have created a little club around it is going to bite you in the ass.\n\nThe reason diversity is important is that decision makers aren't going to be in your boys club.  You are giving space that allows men to get ahead and have greater impact.\n\nAre you only selling to men? Is your product for men only?

Chances are your female employee isn't going to feel comfortable saying anything.  If she does, there's a good chance she'll be ridiculed, called a prude, accused of trying to sabotague the guy's career, etc.\n\n4)  By networking with just the guys (especially by picking activities that are generally male dominiated) you're icing out your female workers.  It's going to be assumed that whats in the pants matters, not what's in the brain.\n\n5)  Even if you don't intend to, you're likely to subconsciously pick the guys you hang out with at the bar for high profile projects, promotions, etc., because \"you know them better\".  Even if that doesn't happen, everyone will assume your drinking buddies will get the best raises and promotions so there's no point going above and beyond if you're not willing to drink your way to the top.\n\n6)  What if you have an employee that has substance issues?

The problem is that you and your business partner are the **leaders** of the business, whereas the others are simply employees. Just like your parents aren't supposed to be your friends, you shouldn't socialize with your boss. You need to keep the boss-employee relationship as professional as possible. The more you hang out with these people, the more likely it'll be that someone ends up taking advantage of your niceness. Act like a leader for a change.

I don\u2019t think you are an AH by nature. But from the perspective of the women, this easily looks like YTA.\n\nIf this is a very regular thing, then you\u2019re putting yourself in an awkward spot. Becoming close friends with your employees is dangerous. Its very much a grey area, and many people will have different opinions. \n\nEmployer/employee relationships involve a power dynamic. You start to get too close, and that dynamic gets muddled. The employees start feeling like your equal, and you lose a bit of power over them. \n\nIve watched it happen to our shop foreman for years. He drinks after work with all his subordinates, and it caused a LOT of drama/issues. After a few drinks, he starts talking about things he shouldn\u2019t, and lets these guys talk brazenly about things that are inappropriate. They might talk shit on some other employees, which now creates a dangerous \u201ccircle of trust\u201d. He developed a click of guys that started treating the other non-involved employees differently. The guys who didn\u2019t engage with the weekly drinking circle felt very outcasted, and lower on the totem pole. While there were other guys, with less tenure, who thought they ran the shop.\n\nHow will it go if you have to fire one of these guys? Or will you start to compromise your decision making to avoid firing or reprimanding a friend? What happens when they ask you for a cash advance? Then a loan? Maybe one time is fine, for certain occasion. But then the others start asking? What about discussing wages? And you\u2019re friends so you feel a moral obligation\u2026 but you\u2019re also employer/employee. It creates tension. \n\nEspecially if you are not including half of the employees, it will create a huge amount of tension. Its unbalanced, and irresponsible as an employer.\n\nBeing *friendly* with your subordinates/employees is different than being *friends*. Keeping a clear invisible line is very important. At the end of the day, you\u2019re the boss. And sometimes the boss has to make decisions that don\u2019t please every employee. Its the most difficult part of my job by far. I love all the employees, and I spend so much of my life around them. \n\nThis may be an unpopular opinion. But I know most other business owners reading this will agree. You\u2019re playing a very dangerous game. \n\nRule of thumb, unless its a company-wide outing or event (ie Christmas party, picnic, celebrating someone\u2019s bday or tenure milestone, retirement party, or an otherwise special occasion.) keep your personal life and wind-down time separate from your subordinates.", "YTA", "YTA", "Can only imagine the \u2018hangout\u2019 is at a strip club.

My suggestion is to keep the boys night out at whatever schedule you insist on. Add a every now and then staff night, let me tell you the men probably won\u2019t show up and you should make everyone happy. The women don\u2019t want to come they just want to feel included.
