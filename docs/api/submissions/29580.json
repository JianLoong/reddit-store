And they enjoyed it precisely because it\u2019s naughty and a sexy night for all involved. That situation invites jokes - I mean how else are you supposed to react? The jokes were meant more super lighthearted rather than actually sexualizing your kids.\n\nI\u2019d like to say it\u2019d be the same if genders were reversed, but society already sexualizes women in their underwear sooo much more than guys so it\u2019s not an objective comparison. That, and lots of men actually are kinda pervy :).", "NTA. I would be incredibly creeped out by this", "What were you supposed to do, say haha yeah my son's ripped and his friend looks like he's hiding a banana, this is very funny! Hey Rachel, check out your kid's dick!\n\nThe fuck is wrong with people?", "Eww NTA I don't want someone pointing out the size of my kid's junk.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think they were out of line to say they\u2019re fit. It\u2019s the \u201cwell-endowed\u201d comment that triggers the ick", "NTA. I don\u2019t understand why someone would start/join a conversation where they\u2019re likely to hear sexual comments about *their own child*", "Lets swap the situation.\n\nIf it was a Dad saying that about young women everyone would understand.\n\nNTA", "I thought of that too!", "Thanks. I mean I understand noticing! But verbalizing is different.", "Very fair, thanks.", "Yes! We all see it, we don\u2019t need to comment on it in public.", "I thought so too!", "10 years!", "Thanks. Yes, of course we will look, I think that\u2019s understood. It\u2019s the discussion that bugged me.", "Yep. If they weren\u2019t our kids, different?", "Ok yeah you\u2019re better than me because I would have flat out told them they\u2019re disgusting. They\u2019ve known him since he was a baby (I know not literally a baby) and the other boys too, that\u2019s so mdd as my levels of wrong and nasty.", "Just to be fair, did you look?", "It\u2019s in really poor taste to mention it to the guy\u2019s mom. You\u2019re not a prude.", "Personally if a 40 year old friend of mine was making comments like that about *any* 19 year old, I'd be questioning their behaviour (and judgement.) But your specific context adds a whole extra layer of creeped out, imo.", "Thanks for the support!", "It was a cute photo, and if I\u2019m being honest, when you see a cute male in briefs you have a look, yes. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any different seeing a cute young woman in underwear. But broadcasting your opinion about it is something different.", "Thanks. Would mentioning it to someone else be different?", "Depends ? Is is huge hammer apparent in his briefs. I mean if it\u2019s apparent he\u2019s hanging a tube snake then it is what it is"]}
