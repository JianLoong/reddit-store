Of course I didn't remove them because it's not against any rules, so I kept them there, that pissed him off and he told me to remove them again but I didn't and since then we have had a strained relationship.\n\nA few days ago my husband (30M) picked up our older daughters early from school and dropped them off at my office, and just to clarify, my boss knows that he does that from time to time when their babysitter has to do something else and she doesn't have a problem with it, in fact, she has told me many times that she likes them to go because they love to help. But my coworker hated it, he said next time they go there talk to HR and hopefully they'll kick me out because I'm unprofessional. I told him to do it, that I didn't care, and before he did I talked to them and since my boss agrees and other colleagues didn't complain about them, they told me that there's no problem because they usually only go there for 30 minutes or sometimes even less time. \n\nMy husband kept taking them to work and this morning my coworker confronted me furiously because he told me that I'm an asshole that I need to understand that he hates children, that it is his work space too and that I must respect it. But I am not going to stop doing it because I know that my daughters do not bother anyone, they do not even talk to him and they are not even in our office because sometimes they are helping the woman who cleans to pick up the coffee cups etc. So AITA for continuing to do that?", "created_utc": 1674841265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mqvj1/aita_for_taking_my_daughters_to_work_even_though/", "score": 651, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's the only thing that would explain his reaction (especially to the pictures).", "Hostile work environments aren't just environments you don't like. Throwing around terms with very real legal definitions in an attempt to get your way is a very good way to get HR to decide you're the problem.\n\nBeing a parent is not a protected class.\n\nBasically if it's illegal to discriminate against you for X reason it's illegal to harass you for it.\n\nBeing harassed is something that OP should bring to HR but OP should not be applying legal definitions that do not apply to the situation. That's a very good way to get fired.\n\n\nKnow your rights and what they entail, y'all.", "He's not necessarily the *only* one in this situation, but yes, I was wondering when someone would bring this up.", "Shame..but it really sounds like he's angry out of fear.  SO's CANNOT be around young children or risk being put in prison, which is really the only motivator I can imagine having this much of an influence on his behavior.", "What country are you in?", "What country are you in?", "Somebody in the comments asked if there is a legal reason he cannot be around children. It is a very legitimate question!", "So a serious work place, not like a small family run thing?", "Agreed.  NTA", "Not if he has certain issues....\n\nThis is bizzare\n\nNTA", "Depends how screwed up he is.", "Nope, not if working in an environment where no kids are expected. I think it\u2019s actually illegal in some places to ask about felony/registry status as it\u2019s discrimination.", "Definitely should do their own research 100%, in addition to bringing the situation to HR!", "I'm wondering if OP has a huge collage of photos all over her cubicle walls and it really does look like a mess. I mean, I'd never complain about it because it's their workspace, but he may actually have a *reason* to tell her it looks unprofessional.", "That is not a stretch, honestly", "That exact situation happened to my friend.  Now she's 34 with an 18 year old.  Always trips me out because she's only 2 years older than me and my oldest is only 7.", "Yeah there are so many steps before losing your mind at someone. The fact that he doesn't even want pictures of kids around him is very suspect. Like I can't imagine mere photos of kids existing being rage inducing for anyone. It makes you wonder if he's uncomfortable with the photos for a different reason.", "Yeah it's not, the closest it gets to that for me is coworkers shoving their phone into my face to show me pictures or play videos. But most of them have caught on to 'Dahlia_Steps doesn't particularly like kids so leave her out of the rotation of showing her these things.' And that's more a common courtesy thing than a 'yo kids suck' thing", "Exactly, if I don\u2019t like your office or you  I don\u2019t go in there, he\u2019s looking for reasons to harass her.", "Right. What kind of nutbag gets that worked up over a PICTURE??? \n\nI mean, what does he do if he's at a restaurant or a grocery store or if he's driving??? He sounds seriously demented and dangerous.", "That's heavily dependent on where you are though, right? I know it sounds like this isn't a person in the US, but at least in California, it is *absolutely* illegal to discriminate against being a parent. It is considered \"Family Responsibilities Discrimination\" (FRD) and state law makes it illegal to discriminate against anyone \"because of their role as a caregiver for a child, parent, or person with disabilities.\"\n\nI'm not sure the exact definition \"hostile work environment\" you are working from but it sounds like your whole argument is that it doesn't fit because being a parent isn't a protected class. So conversely, I'd argue that as being a parent very well could be a protected class, this could very well be a \"hostile work environment.\"\n\nBut even beyond that, there can still be hostile work environments if you aren't a member of a protected class. An able-bodied straight white cis male could easily be in a hostile work environment. For one, they could still be sexually harassed, but even more broadly, if someone is absolutely being a dick and harassing someone for something not legally protected (their favorite sports team, their crooked teeth, them growing up poor, they way they smile, etc.) and yells at them at work, leaves them off important communication, pranks them, badmouths them to all the coworkers and boss, and keeps them off the work schedule, that is STILL a \"hostile work environment,\" even in a legal sense.", "Only on reddit would people read a comment saying \"don't use this term because it has a very real legal definition that doesn't apply.\" and get upset.\n\nUsing it would be like threatening to sue. It might be useful if you have a case- otherwise you've just made yourself into a problem to be dealt with.\n\nHR exits to protect the company, not you. They are not your friend. If they think you'll start causing problems they'll find a way to fire you. Throwing around random legal terms that don't even apply is a good way to become a problem.", "His complaint isn\u2019t valid because he demanded she take photos of her kids off her own desk on his first day before she even brought them in during his first week there. This isn\u2019t \u201cthey\u2019re distracting me\u201d, this is a weird personal issue that he needs to get over. Even her own boss said that it\u2019s fine & that she actually likes when the kids come because they like to help. If they\u2019re actually making a commotion & being distracting, she could ask them to quietly sit & read a book or do homework at the office. He doesn\u2019t even want pictures of them in the office. It sounds like they aren\u2019t being distracting, and the coworker\u2019s own hatred of children is distracting himself", "it is serious but it is also a kids friendly place", "I don't think so, at least in the US.

Why not just have dad take them home? And I thought you worked in the same room/ cubicle block as the complaining co worker?", "Esh\n\nHe's out of line demanding you take down pictures of your kids. \n\nKids don't belong in a serious office workplace, unless it has a daycare in it, which it sounds like it doesn't. He's not out of line at all saying that kids running around distract him from doing his job.
