{"id": 8436, "submission_id": "10mqvj1", "title": "AITA for taking my daughters to work even though my coworker said he didn't want me to do that?", "selftext": "\n\n\nMy (26F) coworker (50sM) hates children, he started working with me just two weeks ago and from the first day he told me to remove the photos of my children (10F, 9F, 8F, 1F) from the office because it seems unprofessional to him. Of course I didn't remove them because it's not against any rules, so I kept them there, that pissed him off and he told me to remove them again but I didn't and since then we have had a strained relationship.\n\nA few days ago my husband (30M) picked up our older daughters early from school and dropped them off at my office, and just to clarify, my boss knows that he does that from time to time when their babysitter has to do something else and she doesn't have a problem with it, in fact, she has told me many times that she likes them to go because they love to help. But my coworker hated it, he said next time they go there talk to HR and hopefully they'll kick me out because I'm unprofessional. I told him to do it, that I didn't care, and before he did I talked to them and since my boss agrees and other colleagues didn't complain about them, they told me that there's no problem because they usually only go there for 30 minutes or sometimes even less time. \n\nMy husband kept taking them to work and this morning my coworker confronted me furiously because he told me that I'm an asshole that I need to understand that he hates children, that it is his work space too and that I must respect it. But I am not going to stop doing it because I know that my daughters do not bother anyone, they do not even talk to him and they are not even in our office because sometimes they are helping the woman who cleans to pick up the coffee cups etc. So AITA for continuing to do that?\n\n**EDIT:** My husband is the father of all my children (for those who asked) but he always works at least 1 or 2 hours more than me, that's why he can't stay with them until I finish my shift. Their nanny has problems with her family and lately she can't stay with them until my husband and I get home, so my husband picks them up from school and drops them off at my job, and he does that because he has more flexibility in his work, but sadly it's not kids friendly, so they can't stay there with him. \n\nAlso, I don't think my co-worker is an SO because criminal records are checked before entering this job and in my country it's not easy to get a job when you have a criminal record, so that's out of the question. I just think that he is a misogynist who hates women and I say that because his hatred is only towards women, he has no problem with men. My other coworker once brought his son and he just said it was unprofessional but he didn't treat him the way he treats me for bringing my daughters to work.", "created_utc": 1674841265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mqvj1/aita_for_taking_my_daughters_to_work_even_though/", "score": 1634, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one cares as long as the kids were behaved. Honestly if they were horrible, it would be cool, since it is temporary. For him to ask you to remove photos of your kids is way way out of line.

When I was little my dad delivered for a paper company and I loved riding along on deliveries and goofing off in the warehouse. Is was a special treat every so often and I have so so so many good memories of it.", "NTA. How does he function  out in public, with, you know, KIDS?", "To start, NTA.\n\nI just wanted to add in my own two cents to offer some potential perspective that I don't believe may have been covered. A lot of people are suggesting the registry angle, and honestly that would be my first thing to look into as well. But if that doesn't turn up anything my experiences may offer a potential avenue for context if you have the chance to explore it.\n\nI have a phobia of children, I also have a strong phobia of teeth (Entirely unrelated to each other) and they both elicit identical physical responses. It's not that I'm antagonistic towards children (or teeth) but just seeing them, interacting with them, talking about them, it triggers immediate and complete revulsion. When looking for jobs I've specifically passed over jobs that has any potential of interacting with children in any way. Such as front facing work at retail, restaurants, and things of that nature. In fact any counter I've worked behind has been at places that require an ID, or were at places like College Campuses, or delivering things to businesses. It's not that I specifically go out of my way to find jobs like that, but when it comes to comparing two jobs that are otherwise entirely equal that little nuance will entirely weigh me in a certain direction. I'll also refuse outright to work at any place that involves teeth in any capacity like a dental hygienist, receptionist at a clinic, or things like that. (Not that I'm qualified for those positions, but I sure as heck wouldn't pursue it.)\n\nMy last job I had was fine, delivering to people but mostly businesses. And at some point I had a new regular on my route, a daycare center. It seemed like a fairly sizeable operation, multi roomed facility with a playground, lots of staff. I'm sure there's a specific word for it, but when I think daycare I think of like a residential house with one or two people juggling 10 kids. But this was like a full on thing.\n\nLong story short, I hated delivering there. My interactions with the children were minimal, I was guided through specific hallways that normally dodged the foot traffic of the children. But there were windows in every room and there were a lot of children just watching me. Occasionally a few would say \"Hi\" to me or try to share something. And of course I'd say hi and listen, because you know my phobia is my problem and I'm not about to inflict my problem onto a child. But by the end of the delivery I would take my truck to the nearby parking lot at a grocery store and spend a good five to ten minutes dry heaving, coughing, and gagging to myself while trying to calm my racing heart and shaking hands.\n\nThere were a lot of problems with that job overall, but few as memorable as the dread I'd feel knowing that at least twice a week I'd have to go back to that damn daycare. Even now if I drive by it in passing I shudder to myself. Funny enough I'm working for a Bachelor's in English and I have my tutoring credentials. I also took a sequence of courses that would have given me entry level certification to work at daycare's and things like that. I thought it would help me get over my phobia, and it absolutely did not. (Still good lower div gen ed credits though.) I have a lot of potential to work with children as a tutor, a prospective teacher, or even in daycare. But there is no way that's happening. Funnily enough while typing this my smart watch alerted me that my heart is racing quite a bit just thinking about it.\n\nFunny how phobias work. Anyways I know I'll need to see a head doc about all this someday. And I have to reiterate I would never antagonize a child nor would I ever try to make my problem their problem. And if I'm forced to interact with them I do my very best to be as polite and cordial as possible. But at the end of the day I'd rather not have to see them anywhere near me.\n\nThis might be an angle to consider when dealing with your coworker. I'm not justifying his behavior, it's totally out of line. He's definitely making a total ass of himself. I think I remember hearing some platitude or saying about \"Anger is generally a fear or terror response.\" If he's reacting so sharply and fiercely, there could be a fear that's compelling those emotions and actions forward.", "Is no else concerned that her husband got her pregnant when she was 16 and he was 20?

Stop trying to justify this maniac.", "She made an edit and said he is the father of all of them", "Why was a 20 year old impregnating someone barely old enough to have their driver's license :S", "ah, op must have added the edit shortly after i read the post because i didn\u2019t see it. my bad", "He is still not likely to get her sacked. She'd be asked to not bring her children in before that. Though if he's making a name for himself by being nasty to long-term employees, then he'll be lucky to get through his probation. He probably wasn't expecting OP to be proactive, confirm policy and just comply because he might complain to HR.", "Many places have hygiene rules.  This particular place already okayed the kids.\n\nNot the same.", "I agree with you. It's rude AF to bring your kids into the office this frequently. It's not a day care. Once in a while in a pinch? Sure. But she's taking total advantage of it.", "OP probably doesn\u2019t want to be around a hateful, nasty, child-hating fuckface but we don\u2019t all get what we want now do we? Assholes who create hostile work environments are potential for HR issues galore. Children who have been respectful and not disruptive that are cleared by boss, well, not so much. Decide who you\u2019d want to fight for in a court of law? Because if this fucking clown keeps it up he\u2019s a liability and a lawsuit waiting to happen.", "I think only two got rid of the check if you\u2019ve been convicted of a felony box. But the registry is public information", "It's not illegal on the federal level (see the other comment quoting EEOC), but there may be state's with specific laws.", "That doesn't explain his issue with the pictures of her kids that he wanted removed.", "And the other two are 9 and 8 so he basically knocked her up immediately after having the last baby. Twice!", "\"my husband picked up OUR older daughters\"", "Yeah, I have to imagine they're at least somewhat distracting, even if they're well behaved and out of the room for the 30mins or so they're there. I'm with you, if it was enough of a problem, I'd just ask for a different office. But it's weird to confront her about it (since the boss and others don't mind, and even besides that, it's just a thing parents have to do sometimes. It should definitely be more normalized to let people bring their well behaved kids to work with them occasionally when they literally don't have another option) and it's even weirder to bring up the photos.", "Haha! I mean I think most parents probably do understand because they will be the ones the kids disrupt the most. I am childless so I can't say but my colleagues and friends with kids find them wildly distracting and pay for people to get them away from them when they are working, even from home \ud83d\ude02. There will always be some willfully ignorant people though, I'm sure!", "I didn't say him demanding the pictures be removed was okay but that doesn't mean that she's still not an asshole for treating her workplace like a daycare center. His actions don't justify hers.", "He could be a senior who was dating a freshman. It's not the most unheard of thing in the world. It's kinda weird but it's not necessarily illegal.", "It's definitely the same. Bringing your kid once in a while when the daycare/school closes for a snow day or whatever is different from letting them run around the office three days a week.", "NTA but I would recommend considering complaining about your coworker\u2019s behavior to either your boss or hr. First of all he\u2019s your coworker, not your supervisor, so it\u2019s not his place to give you orders such as to remove the pictures from your desk. If your boss is ok with things or finds you professional that\u2019s all that matters, your coworker needs to stay in his lane. Second of all Gus behavior seems like harassment to me. And for someone who seems so concerned with whether or not you are professional his behavior does not seem professional", "Look up \"Ban the Box\". Many state and city level laws exist that do not allow an employer to ask for criminal history on applications. \n\nEmployers may only run a background check during the offer phase.\n\nThis is in hopes that an otherwise great candidate that got a drunk and disorderly charge 10 years ago isn't immediately rejected and thus stuck on government assistance forever.", "Plus the sex offender registry is available online.", "If they were a registered sex offender then a routine background check, hell a Google search, would have revealed it.", "That does not mean they're biologically his. My stepdad refers to all of us as his kids despite only being biologically related to 1/4 of us.", "Uhh it is in fact illegal in many US states and countries. Most romeo and juliet laws in the US have a 2 year margin, not 4.", "She stated the kids help out other employees. No one said they run anywhere.", "Except they're not running around and bothering him and her BOSS said it was acceptable that her kids are in the office. He's probably on the pedo registry and didn't disclose that information and is afraid of getting found out.", "In many jurisdictions, there are legal limits on how long children under a given age may be away from the presence of an adult, if that\u2019s allowed at all. This is for the kids\u2019 safety. \n\nKids the age of OP\u2019s generally don\u2019t need much direct supervision if they have quiet entertainment like drawing paper. However, they must have a nearby adult who can act in an emergency, or provide access to necessities like washrooms.", "That is the guidance. However we're also all supposed to wash our hands for the length of a happy birthday and we've all had some pissy handshakes.\n\nIn practice all HR departments ask in order to cover their ass. Most employers would rather take the risk on a discrimination suit.", "TIL.  Is this a new thing because I swear it asked this on pretty much every application I've ever had.  Including minimum wage type jobs.", "Not every job background checks, unfortunately. They only do bg checks at my job for management. And I work retail, kids are everywhere.", "True, but she didn't say she is from the US. This would be legal in most of Europe (where the age of consent is 14-16 years typically). If we speculate that she posted after work, that actually lines up with European time zones.", "Age of consent in my state is 16.\n\nEdit: The age of consent is 16 in 33 of the US states. I'm not saying it's not weird, I'm just saying the story is plausible and he's not necessarily legally a sex offender.", "Leave it to reddit commenters to make a huge stretch. Someone not wanting kids where they work hardly points to sex offender. And by OP's own words her company does a strict background check and that's unlikely. But way to go out there with it I guess.", "So I can drop a 12 year old off with a babysitter without expecting to pay?", "It was on my application when I applied at my current job in April 2022. So idk.", "It's legal in most of the US too.", "No. But OP was present. My apologies for not specifying that the trusted adult should be aware of and consent to their responsibility to the child, as that additional context isn't relevant to the situation we're discussing. I can address a couple of additional arguments I've seen you make on this post since you like comparing this situation to wild hypotheticals:\n\nThis is not like bringing a dog to the office because they are well behaved human beings and also (hopefully) don't shit on the floor.\n\nThis is not like hanging a nazi flag in the office because the children (hopefully) are in no way associated with systematic genocide.", "That's my point! Someone watching kids are not also performing their job. If they are not old enough to be left alone, then they require supervision. They're either being adequately supervised and someone isn't doing their job, or their being neglected. It sounds like they're helping someone do their job and not being compensated for it, while also being supervised by the person who isn't doing their whole job.", "You missed my initial point. They don't need to be actively supervised! They know how to behave in public and them making someone else's job easier voluntarily is far from keeping someone from doing their job (and this is not unpaid child labor). They're well behaved  9 and 10 year olds. They don't need line of sight supervision. They need \"don't run in the halls and stay out of people's way.\" The presence of the parent in the general vicinity is usually enough, the usually being a case by case determination and based on past experience by everyone involved who isn't offended by the mere presence of photos of children, they're fine."]}
