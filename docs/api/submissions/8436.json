Of course I didn't remove them because it's not against any rules, so I kept them there, that pissed him off and he told me to remove them again but I didn't and since then we have had a strained relationship.\n\nA few days ago my husband (30M) picked up our older daughters early from school and dropped them off at my office, and just to clarify, my boss knows that he does that from time to time when their babysitter has to do something else and she doesn't have a problem with it, in fact, she has told me many times that she likes them to go because they love to help. But my coworker hated it, he said next time they go there talk to HR and hopefully they'll kick me out because I'm unprofessional. I told him to do it, that I didn't care, and before he did I talked to them and since my boss agrees and other colleagues didn't complain about them, they told me that there's no problem because they usually only go there for 30 minutes or sometimes even less time. \n\nMy husband kept taking them to work and this morning my coworker confronted me furiously because he told me that I'm an asshole that I need to understand that he hates children, that it is his work space too and that I must respect it. But I am not going to stop doing it because I know that my daughters do not bother anyone, they do not even talk to him and they are not even in our office because sometimes they are helping the woman who cleans to pick up the coffee cups etc. So AITA for continuing to do that?", "created_utc": 1674841265, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mqvj1/aita_for_taking_my_daughters_to_work_even_though/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In fact, YOU should be going to HR for him harassing you.", "NTA  Your coworker took a job at a kid friendly workplace. It was kid friendly before he started. If it bothers him, he should get the owners to change the policy or find a job in a place that is not child friendly.", "NTA.  You have cleared this with your boss and HR.  Your coworker has some serious issues, which I hope he addresses.  It is not on you to resolve them for him or to change your life to appease him.", "NTA. Tell HR and your Manager he is becoming menacing. Use that word, menacing in his interactions with you and stated he hates children. \n\nA guy like that should work from home, far away from humans.", "Well, if your boss and HR have no problem with it, then NTA, especially if they're staying out of the way and not bothering your coworker in any fashion other than existing.", "NTA\n\n  What crawled up his butt??

Take preemptive action now.", "NTA. you have permission from your boss and HR. your coworker is over stepping it's not his place to control your office decor or override your bosses permissions regarding your kids. You should definately be respectful and keep them from interfering with your coworkers concentration but it seems like he just expects everyone to pretend kids don't exist around him and he is not entitled to that. I personally would make sure my boss and HR is aware of the persistent issue with him trying to give you orders....if he is really your coworker as stated and not in a position of power over you than that in itself is inappropriate, regardless of what in particular the orders are about.", "Oh he can get right over himself.

I don't love kids all that much either, but if they're leaving him alone, he can deal with you bringing your kids on occasion. He's just being an AH about it.", "NTA. He is making work a hostile environment. You need to start complaining about him. Demanding the pictures taken off the wall should have been his first warning from HR.", "NTA. \n\nThis co-worker sounds really fun to work with (sarcasm). If the boss doesn\u2019t mind this and HR didn't mind this, why is he so upset about it?

Or just your boss?", "I\u2026 can\u2019t even understand what the hell is going on with this guy. First of all, you have seniority over him (which, it\u2019s a minor detail) but the gul this guy has to start a job and start demanding pictures removed is insane.\n\nSecondly, if the mere picture of a kid is enough to enrage this dude, I would be asking questions like which SO website he\u2019s registered on. \n\nJust report his unstable ass to HR. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. You should escalate this before he does.\n\nHe thinks he's your superior because you're a young woman and he's an older man.

I\u2019d be concerned about his background.", "NTA\n\nThat's pretty audacious behaviour on his part after only two weeks working with you.\n\nYou should tell him he needs to understand you love children, this is your workspace too and he needs to respect that.", "NTA you\u2019ve cleared this with your own boss & HR if this new employee keeps harassing you about your children I\u2019d bri g this to the attention of your boss & HR & tell them also about how he asked u to remove pictures of your children , it is your workplace as well & you have a right to a peaceful environment without him continuing to confront you over this issue that is clearly his alone", "Lol, this guy is incredible. I always hated having kids hang out in the office, too, but if they aren\u2019t around me I wouldn\u2019t pay it any mind. Telling you to take down your pictures? That\u2019s so crazy. What has this guy done for the first 30+ years of his career that he sees that as a viable option. I want to say you\u2019re NTA but also I\u2019m rooting so hard for this glorious lunatic", "NTA. You need to report this to HR and your manager as harassment. Ordering you to take down pictures, and now confronting you about children being around, but not physically in your office? Even if they were, it's a non-issue as long as they're not being disruptive. Something tells me this will escalate until your husband or someone else confronts this guy.", "Well... soft YTA. You don't mention much about your place of business. And your coworker is clearly a child-hating troll. However. I'm betting that this office was not designed to accommodate children. And it is honestly unprofessional to treat your workplace as a de facto daycare. \n\nAnd just because nobody else has complained doesn't mean they don't agree with me.\n\nOnce a month? That is probably no big deal. Once a week? Too much. Keep the office an office and don't ask others to shoulder your burden.", "NTA. If HR is cool with you bringing in your kids, as is your boss, I would talk to them over the harassment.", "NTA. If his problem had started when your kids were in your shared working space, I'd be tempted to agree with him. BUT, as it started well before that, and over your family pictures and his hatred of children, he's clearly in the wrong. I suspect if you listen to him and give him what he's asking for, it'll be the first of many unreasonable demands on his part.", "YTA. It doesn't matter if your boss or whoever is okay with it.
