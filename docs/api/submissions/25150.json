{"id": 25150, "submission_id": "15wwbwh", "title": "AITA for making a family check a baby cart so my luggage could fit on the overhead bin?", "selftext": "I don\u2019t know if this is an universal thing, but in my country, you need to pay to check bags when flying. This does not include, of course, carry ons and things like baby carts. \n\nYou can usually pay extra to sit in the first five rows of an airplane (though some people who are priority can sit there for free). This extra fee doesn\u2019t include only your seat, it also includes a few perks: boarding first (just after priority) and guaranteed overhead space for your carry on on the top of your seat (and, consequentially, leaving the airplane first because of that). That\u2019s important because those are the main reasons I pay the extra fee. Those are detailed when you buy the ticket. \n\nSo today I was boarding a plane back home with my (small) carry on when I opened the overhead bin of row 1 (where I was seating) and it was packed full, though there were not that many people in the airplane and even in the first 5 rows. I then looked into row 2 and it was full. The first space open was in row 8, which meant that when the plane arrived, I would probably have to wait for the whole airplane to leave before getting my bags. \n\nI called the attendant and explained my situation. She then tried to find out why it was so packed. It turns out there were two families with babies (parents plus babies) that had around 7 itens each in the overhead bin. Luggage plus big backpack for each parent, luggage plus big backpack for each baby, and then the baby\u2019s cart - which is commonly checked at the airplane, at no cost, and delivered first (they are usually lined just outside the airplane when people start leaving). The backpacks were too big to fit under the seat.  Plus, the babies, with all due respect, don\u2019t have a proper seat and therefore are not allowed luggage. So they had 6 extra volumes then they were allowed, thus crowding the overhead. \n\nThe flight attendant then said \u201cthere was nothing she could do\u201d. I do understand and sympathize with the parents, but I said to her that I wanted a refund for not having the perks I paid for. She said that was not possible. I then said \u201cfine, then make sure my luggage is on row 1, where it is supposed to be\u201d. The only way to achieve that was checking something of the parents, which ended up being the baby carts (another woman in row 1 was in the same situation and also demanded space for her carry on). Parents got pissed and called us assholes, told us that we did not understand what having babies were like. I did not engage. \n\nWhen the plane landed, I was the first to leave the plane and the baby carts were already outside waiting for the parents (they cannot even open inside the airplane, so it had not clear advantage to have them in the bins to begin with). \n\nI\u2019m usually more of a pushover and after getting home I felt bad for the situation. I know I was technically in my rights, but that does not mean I was not the asshole. In my mind the AH is the airline not better organizing everything and accommodating parents, but I could have, for once, just waited a bit. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692589832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wwbwh/aita_for_making_a_family_check_a_baby_cart_so_my/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
