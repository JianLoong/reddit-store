{"id": 25150, "submission_id": "15wwbwh", "title": "AITA for making a family check a baby cart so my luggage could fit on the overhead bin?", "selftext": "I don\u2019t know if this is an universal thing, but in my country, you need to pay to check bags when flying. This does not include, of course, carry ons and things like baby carts. \n\nYou can usually pay extra to sit in the first five rows of an airplane (though some people who are priority can sit there for free). This extra fee doesn\u2019t include only your seat, it also includes a few perks: boarding first (just after priority) and guaranteed overhead space for your carry on on the top of your seat (and, consequentially, leaving the airplane first because of that). That\u2019s important because those are the main reasons I pay the extra fee. Those are detailed when you buy the ticket. \n\nSo today I was boarding a plane back home with my (small) carry on when I opened the overhead bin of row 1 (where I was seating) and it was packed full, though there were not that many people in the airplane and even in the first 5 rows. I then looked into row 2 and it was full. The first space open was in row 8, which meant that when the plane arrived, I would probably have to wait for the whole airplane to leave before getting my bags. \n\nI called the attendant and explained my situation. She then tried to find out why it was so packed. It turns out there were two families with babies (parents plus babies) that had around 7 itens each in the overhead bin. Luggage plus big backpack for each parent, luggage plus big backpack for each baby, and then the baby\u2019s cart - which is commonly checked at the airplane, at no cost, and delivered first (they are usually lined just outside the airplane when people start leaving). The backpacks were too big to fit under the seat.  Plus, the babies, with all due respect, don\u2019t have a proper seat and therefore are not allowed luggage. So they had 6 extra volumes then they were allowed, thus crowding the overhead. \n\nThe flight attendant then said \u201cthere was nothing she could do\u201d. I do understand and sympathize with the parents, but I said to her that I wanted a refund for not having the perks I paid for. She said that was not possible. I then said \u201cfine, then make sure my luggage is on row 1, where it is supposed to be\u201d. The only way to achieve that was checking something of the parents, which ended up being the baby carts (another woman in row 1 was in the same situation and also demanded space for her carry on). Parents got pissed and called us assholes, told us that we did not understand what having babies were like. I did not engage. \n\nWhen the plane landed, I was the first to leave the plane and the baby carts were already outside waiting for the parents (they cannot even open inside the airplane, so it had not clear advantage to have them in the bins to begin with). \n\nI\u2019m usually more of a pushover and after getting home I felt bad for the situation. I know I was technically in my rights, but that does not mean I was not the asshole. In my mind the AH is the airline not better organizing everything and accommodating parents, but I could have, for once, just waited a bit. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692589832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15wwbwh/aita_for_making_a_family_check_a_baby_cart_so_my/", "score": 569, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was even offered by the flight attendant for me (for free). The problem is that they would impact people regardless. If they had put their stuff on row 8, for instance, it would also create a domino effect with the entire plane (people would have to dislodge their bags a few rows behind until a lot of them had no space at all). Granted, in that case, people from the back had not paid the extra fee and would have to gate check their bags.

I would still be mad, but I wouldn\u2019t have demanded my space. The flight attendant clearly realized that she had screwed up by allowing them so much luggage inside. I was not the only one impacted. The parents were on row 3 and had used the space from row 1 and 2. So when people from row 1 started arriving, they had to use row 3 and on. Another woman from two 1 also got pissed and demanded her space. When people were leaving the airplane was a shit show, because by then a lot of people had luggage way behind them. Also because the parents were having to take way too much things from the overhead that they could not properly carry on the small space of the airplane, even without the strollers.

They rules say you are entitled to two volumes each when boarding: one carry one and one bag / backpack to put under the seat in front of you. I will also consider the babies are entitled to a diaper bag. They had each: one large carry one, one large backpack (honestly, the size of a carry on); plus one carry on for the baby, plus the diaper bag, plus the stroller. Honestly, it was not even convenient for them to carry so much thing around; it would probably be better to check a large bag and just bring a backpack / diaper bag. In that scenario, I would understand the stroller. They four of them were taking two full rows of overhead space. They were also in row 3, and had used the space of row 1 and 2. So when people from the first rows arrived, they started putting their bags on rows 3 and on.", "This is 100% dependent on which airline they\u2019re traveling. For United USA domestic as an example each passenger is permitted one carry one (which could be the ultra compact stroller, which are explicitly called out as allowed), and one personal item. Babies are allowed a diaper in addition. I BELIEVE lap kids are entitled to their own luggage in this scenario as well. Now common sense says put one under your seat, but you don\u2019t have to and these families boarded promptly in their nice seats with the allowed baggage, which would have been vetted by the gate agent. Nowhere in any baggage policy have I heard \u201cyou will definitely get to put your baggage directly above your seat.\u201d The entitled person here is the one making families who paid extra and are sitting quietly in their seat move baggage because they don\u2019t want to put their bags 2 rows back. YTA.", "I'd say the stroller was used as a cargo carrier.\n\nYou can fit a lot of stuff on a stroller.", "Ok, I was just responding to:   \n   \n>In the US baby strollers are checked at the gate.    \n   \nWhile people can (and do) check strollers that can\u2019t fold down smaller than a carry-on, there isn\u2019t the need to check a stroller that does fit the size guidelines. Those are allowed to be counted as carry-on luggage.  \n   \nIn this case the stroller is a red herring as the real issue is the fact that the families brought (and were allowed to board) with oversized and excess baggage. OP is NTA and the families should have planned (and packed) better.", "I would understand if every client had the normal amount of luggage and somehow got crowded. More than once, I changed seats I had paid for because there were people with special needs / children traveling alone, for instance. I would also understand if my luggage was above the \u201cextra fee\u201d area, up until row 5, though the fee specify \u201cabove your seat\u201d. The problem is that it got crowded because some people were using extra space.", "NTA!! Strollers get checked at the gate, not put into overhead bins.", "NTA. I\u2019ve flown with strollers. Guess what? They pack that shit last before we board for the exact reason you said. It was waiting for them when they got off. They\u2019re assholes, not you or the other lady.", "Why do you wonder if you are T A?\n\n\\- THEY didn't check in the carts which they were suppose to do.\n\n\\- THEY brought six more pieces of luggage than allowed.\n\n\\- THEIR excessive luggage took space from OTHER passengers (not just you and the other lady).\n\n\\- THEY didn't pay to take the extra luggage with them. ('cause if they had, it would have been checked in as it was too much for handluggage)\n\n\\- THEY had their cart back when they got out of the plane, so it was very selfish to put it in the overhead bin, where they don't even belong.\n\n\\- The Flight Attendant shouldn't have let them board with the carts and excessive luggage. It should have been tagged and put in the hold. She couldn't be bothered to do her job.\n\n\\- YOU were missing out on the perks you specifically paid for, due to entitled passengers and a lazy flight attendant.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Idk why your airline even allowed the carts inside the plane to begin with", "NTA. You paid for the space AND they had more than they were entitled to use.", "NTA - My oldest sister put a pack-and-play (playpen) in what was supposed to be the overhead space me and my husband would be using (she was across the aisle and also took up an entire bin for her, her husband and their 4 kids).  The flight attendant actually threatened to toss me off the plane if I couldn't fit my bag under my seat because \"overhead space isn't a guarantee\".  I know it isn't but to let someone take up 1.5 entire bins to themselves?  \n\nLuckily another flight attendant found a spot for my bag because it was definitely not fitting under the seat in front of me and they were not offering to check it.\n\nLast vacation I've been on with her and I wont be doing it ever again.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019ve flown with infants and their gear many times. \n\nYou leave the stroller and large items like car seats at the gate to be checked.", "Ugh this pisses me off to no end. I traveled as a solo parent with 3 kids when they were 10, 6 and 4. We had 2 backpacks (me and my oldest), 3 luggages and 2 car seats. I knew I couldn\u2019t do it all and my oldest was no way strong enough to help.  I paid extra to make sure our seats were together and also checked everything except the backpacks. \n\nThose were entitled AH parents.", "I always get annoyed when parents think that their bad choices are other people's responisbilities.", "I'm pretty surprised that the parents were allowed on with that much luggage when they clearly did not have the matching number of seats.  And the flight attendants had to have seen them shoving everything up there when they clearly were not sitting in those rows.  I'd consider a letter to the airline.", "Ate you talking about an diaper bag, or an suitcase type thing. I believe even lap infants are allowed a diaper bag as part of their free ticket. I always bought my under 2 a full seat and they had their own carry on (look up jet kids suitcase) and diaper bag with them, plus gate checked a small stroller. After they could reasonably walk, we abandoned the stroller and just went with the jet kids suitcase that they sat on as we pulled them through airports.", "I absolutely agree. OP could be minus a child present for a whole range of reasons, but I do tend to operate on a kindness basis to all I meet and berating someone for being without a child present with them could be for a devastating and traumatic reason. These parents could've hit a very sore spot and opened a can of traumatic worms with their words and it wasn't necessary. All because OP was using the space they were entitled to use and paid for."]}
