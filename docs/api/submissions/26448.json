My wife was the one who came up with the names for our kids, as I never had strong opinions on a baby name, my wife decided to name our son after her great grandfather, I never questioned it and never bothered to learn more about him, which looking back was probably a mistake.\r  \n\r  \nA few months ago, our son was at a party with his friends from baseball, and they were sharing tiktoks with each other, one of the boys shared a tik tok about an \u201calmost name\u201d (basically, like it sounds, what your parents almost named you), one of my son\u2019s friends asked about my son\u2019s names and he mentioned who he was named after. The boy decided to type the name into google and was scrolling through results until he found something interesting.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife\u2019s great grandfather was a state legislator in the Southern US before the civil rights era. As you may have guessed from that, he was a segregationist and voted in favor of bills to maintain segregation. \r  \n\r  \nWhen we picked our son up from the party, he started to yell at us and we had to calm him down. He asked why we would name him after a bad guy like his great grandpa. This started some arguing in the car and when we got home later that night, we discussed it. Our son told us he talked to his friends and he was changing his name, and that was final. My wife was a bit upset, she grew up here in the south when I\u2019m originally from a hippie little town in New England. My wife has become a lot more accepting since we met, but this was still a bit hard for her, she eventually accepted it though and moved on.\r  \n\r  \nWe now refer to a name chosen by our son with the help of his friends, his classmates at school have started to use it and while he\u2019s had some issues, it hasn\u2019t been terrible. One of my son\u2019s friends is a trans boy and he has had it worse, though my son and his other friends always work on protecting the boy from bullying.\r  \n\r  \nMy son\u2019s new name is one he\u2019s proud of and named after someone he looks up to. Recently he got some items with his new name, like a men\u2019s necklace and a sign in his room.\r  \n\r  \nThe issue is, a few days after he got the items with his new name (which was 2 weeks ago), our daughter went and ruined them, by breaking the chain on the necklace and banging his sign. Our daughter doesn\u2019t like the name change, saying her brother is just being a \u201csensitive zoomer\u201d and something about boys being too \u201cweak\u201d these days. Our daughter has said \u201cedgy\u201d stuff like this in the past year or so,  even when we condemn her. As a result of the damage, my wife and I told her we were suspending her allowance until the price of the damages were paid back. Our daughter is saying we are being unfair to her, and has apologized for what she did. My wife went on her facebook mom\u2019s group to ask for help and most of the moms agreed we were too hard on her.

I would bet good money she\u2019s already been or is well on her way to being radicalized. She\u2019s angry at your son for not wanting to be named after a segregationist and is using the kind of language about it I\u2019d expect from a racist grandpa on Facebook. Alarms should be going off in your head. Start with YouTube history and TikTok likes.", "NTA. Your daughter purposefully broke items that were meaningful to her younger brother because she disagreed with something that has no actual impact on her. Suspending her allowance to pay for replacements is a perfectly fair and logical consequence. At fifteen, she needs to understand that just apologising doesn\u2019t make everything go away.", "NTA\nThat is entirely proportional and fair. (I\u2019m a fairly laud back mum of teens too)\n\nI think you and your wife handled your son\u2019s concerned really well and were respectful about his feelings. \n\nYour daughter obviously has some stuff going on. When you say she is being edgy, do you mean she is pushing boundaries about what is acceptable and what isn\u2019t  eg: following more extreme views and perhaps saying stuff that isn\u2019t socially acceptable? That sounds really challenging (and tiring) and I think you are aware needs careful handling. Clamping down on her for them will pose lead to alienation and increase her belief in these viewpoints. (Your allowance punishment is ok because it is in relation to a separate event. Punishing extreme views doesn\u2019t work - that is much more complex to manage and takes time)\n\nWould she attend therapy? If she isn\u2019t listening to you and it is escalating, I\u2019d recommend seeing a skilled counsellor who works with this kind of issue.  If it has been going on for a year, I\u2019d be seeking help. Sometimes it can just be a bit of teenage rebellion but there\u2019s a lot of dissatisfaction these days, (quite understandably) and it can be easy to get swayed believing in a cause. If she is feeling misunderstood at home, that can drive external belonging too. I\u2019d be looking for help now, before the problem gets too big.", "NTA. She\u2019s old enough to understand that actions have consequences, even if you eventually come to regret it and apologize. She has to replace the stuff she broke, and her allowance is being docked until it\u2019s paid off. That\u2019s called parenting.", "NTA. She destroyed her brother's belongings and has to pay him back. Your punishment is reasonable and your daughter needs to learn that actions have consequences, it's not enough to apologize.", "Daughter breaks item, daughter repays damage. All I see is an important life lesson. NTA.", " NTA but you have dealt with the material issue but not the malice behind her behavior", "NTA. Using her allowance to repay the items she broke (and not accidentally at that) is completely fair. After all, just apologizing won\u2019t replace the things she broke. \n\nIt\u2019s ironic that she accuses her brother of being too weak, but she herself can\u2019t take the consequences of her own actions. That seems par for the course for people who call others weak. \n\nBut, you need to tackle this \u201cedgy\u201d phase she is going through. She can dislike other\u2019s choices all she wants, but she doesn\u2019t have the right to break things just because she doesn\u2019t like them. If she keeps this up, she is going to wind up arrested.", "NTA. I think your daughter just wanted a reason to bully your son and shit on him. You have to step in and parent her. Breaking someones stuff is a no go. \n\nAlso, good thing your son and changed his name and you supported him. Also good that you realized you made a mistake there. As a german, I would also not name my kids after certain relatives from the 30s/40s, no matter how much i would like the name ...", "NTA\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t get ahold of this now and teach her to respect people you\u2019ll have bigger issues , Actions have consequences", "NTA\nShe\u2019s 15 not 5. She knew exactly what she was doing. It wasn\u2019t an accident. She can pay to replace them.", "Ugh. What a miserable daughter. Jealous; selfish and a bully. Best of luck", "What? Why are you being harsh on her? She\u2019s 15 and fully knew what she was doing and she did it deliberately actions have consequences, her paying for the damage is perfectly reasonable. Ignore these mom groups they\u2019re clearly raising irresponsible kids if they think you\u2019re being unfair. NTA.", "NTA- As a black person I appreciate hearing other people valuing the sensitivities of people not wanting to be associated with anything involving the unnecessary separation of people and elitist behavior.\nGood on you for supporting your son.\n\nAs for your daughter, it\u2019s fine to have an opinion- it\u2019s not okay to damage other people\u2019s things.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter needs to learn there are consequences to her actions.  Just because she doesn't like something doesn't mean she can go and ruin it.  I think suspending her allowance until she has paid for the damages is the perfect punishment.", "NTA. \n\nThe monetary punishment perfectly fits the crime - she caused damage intentionally, she pays for it. To be honest, she should really have additional punishment (e.g., grounding, phone privileges restricted, etc.) - she shouldn't get in the habit of thinking she can cause problems for others and simply buy her way out of it.\n\nWhile her opinion sucks, I suppose she has the right to hold it. What she doesn't have the right to do is damage others' property because they don't agree with her. That's pretty sociopathic.\n\nI would criticize your wife for wasting time on a facebook mom's groups looking for advice - that's one of the last places to get a reasonable opinion. Of course, I'm saying that while posting on reddit, so...", "NTA, but missing the point if this is the only thing you're doing.\n\nPunishment creates desirable behaviour - when you're there to witness it. Probably.\n\nThere should be consequences, but they have to go hand in hand with educating your daughter about WHY her behaviour is an issue, because no human being - adult or child - changes unless they choose to.", "NTA. Your daughter deliberately broke her brothers' property out of spite. She needs to learn that there is a price for her actions.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said you may want to check what sites she's been on.", "NTA. You're teaching your daughter the consequences of damaging other people's property - you have to reimburse the victim for their loss. She's lucky that you're not punishing her for bullying her younger brother in addition to replacing the things she destroyed.", "NTA.  The mom group is wrong. You did right. She damaged property and should pay for it. How is your daughter going yo learn there are consequences fir her actions if she never gets punished.", "NTA. She broke her brother's things on purpose. It's absolutely fair to make her pay to fix them. Not liking the name change isn't any kind of excuse for destroying his property.\n\nYou also need to sit your daughter down and have a proper conversation about the \"edgy\" things she's coming out with, what kind of content she's viewing, and who she is spending time with.\n\nThere is a  lot of incredibly toxic content around, and algorithms can be very manipulative, especially for young people who don't have enough context or life experience to know better. At that age, it's all very cool and edgy until it's actually dangerous.", "Huh, your daughter seems like the adult here, well, except for the breaking stuff. I\u2019m named after a crappy drunk uncle who killed himself.", "Nta", "NTA. Your daughter is. Making her pay for the things she destroyed is entirely fair and reasonable.", "NTA. She chose to break something, now she's facing the consequences. FAFO.", "NTA.\n\nAsking your daughter to pay to replace the items she destroyed is a natural consequence to her awful behaviour.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your daughter did not come up with this stuff on her own. Unless your wife is saying this stuff behind your back, your daughter is being fed some scary information through social media, YouTube, and/or her friends at school. You have to get to the bottom of this ASAP, before it sticks.", "NTA at all.  Your daughter clearly needs the discipline.  The troubling crap about 'zoomers' and other edgy stuff suggests she's getting fed a lot of right wing nonsense on social media.  Regardless of what your political affiliation is the idea that you can just destroy someone's stuff because you don't like their new name is a great way to end up in jail.  At 15 she's already far, far too old not to have learned this.  Taking her allowance is a very gentle punishment.", "\"You broke it, you bought it\"  *is fair*.  This is a lesson she should learn sooner rather than later - that you are responsible for your actions, and actions have consequences. This time, she hurt her brother and broke his things. She does something like this out in the real world and she could find herself in court or in jail.\n\nOn the other hand, If she pays for some \"necessities\" out of her allowance, you might consider withholding a part of it until the debt is paid off rather than the entire amount - Whatever you decide, put it in writing. An itemized \"bill\" with each item she damaged and it's replacment cost, the total amount she owes, and the repayment schedule that you intend to impose.  Be sure to replace those items for your son.\n\nNTA", "To you and your wife most of those moms are idiots. What you are teaching your daughter is actions has consequences.

Algorithms on those platforms have been proven to push kids towards radicalizing content. OP has a very small window of time to turn this around.", "Also, u/ab2twt I\u2019d look into what your wife or other relatives (could be either side, honestly) have been saying or excusing when they\u2019ve been talking with your daughter. This is especially the case if you know that someone is a Lost Cause apologist. It could be that something that was said either recently or in the past is allowing your daughter to rationalize her attitude in her mind. What was said may have been deliberate or inadvertent, so tread cautiously.", "Honestly, just repaying it isn\u2019t enough with the context, but it\u2019s a start.", "Or the underlying racism.", "On second thought, how about giving your daughter a choice for an alternate punishment:\n\nSince she feels entitled to destroy your son's possessions because she doesn't agree with him, your son gets to do the same thing if he disagrees with her - so he can go and destroy the same number of items and not be expected to pay for it.  He gets to choose which ones. \n\nOr, she can stick to your original punishment. Her choice.\n\n(Obviously don't let your son do this, it would lead to terrible escalation, but maybe putting the idea out there might give some perspective to someone sorely in need of it?)"]}
