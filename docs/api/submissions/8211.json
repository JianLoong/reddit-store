You're her kid yes but she hasn't earned the title of mother. \n\nYou can't just say \"okay I'll call you mum for x time then switch back to your legal name\" because that doesn't work like that. She'll claim she's still depressed or grieving and make you look like an asshole.\n\nStick to how you feel. She can't use her grief to make demands. Grief doesn't excuse her past behavior nor does it reward her with things that cross other people's boundaries. Grief excuse some emotions and behaviors but doesn't excuse it all.\n\nSimple as that.", "**NTA**\n\nAnd while I don't advocate egregious cruelty, if Lisa keeps pushing this to the point of making you uncomfortable, perhaps she would like to consider this:\n\nThroughout your entire childhood - heck, your entire relationship - the only person's feelings, wants, and needs Lisa has ever worried about, including when you were a vulnerable child in need of love, guidance, stability, etc., were her own. So it's not just that Lisa hasn't earned the right to be called \"Mom\" by you - though she absolutely hasn't; she is your biological mother but she is in no way your \"Mom\" and never has been. The real crux of the matter here is that Lisa has never earned the right to ask you for your consideration at all, or for you to do anything \"because she needs it\". Because other than leaving you with the two parents who actually gave you the things you needed and have become your REAL mom and dad - your grandparents - she has never once in your entire existence stopped to ask what she could give YOU when you needed it.\n\nThat Lisa is grieving is irrelevant. That she is sad doesn't matter. You have been through grief, sadness, abandonment, and so much more . . . and you did it as a child. And throughout all of that, Lisa absented herself. She has no right to ask you for ANYTHING to \"make her happy\".  Your Nan is right, Lisa's feelings are not your responsibility. Your Nan, in fact, is a very smart lady. And you are NTA. Lisa has spent her whole life worrying about her own happiness. She can continue to be the centre of her own universe . . . she does not need to be a priority in yours.", "NTA - She hasn\u2019t earned the title.", "NTA she wasn\u2019t your mom, she doesn\u2019t get the privilege because she\u2019s depressed.", "Nta. Don't let anyone tell you how you should feel and act about these things. Im not going to get into the rest of your story but being guilted over that just to assuage her feelings is not ok. It's totally your choice and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.", "NTA,  she has no right after all these years for that request nor to be upset if you don\u2019t agree.  The time for that conversation was 21 years ago.", "NTA Your mother basically abandoned her role as a parent and forfeited the title that went with it.", "NTA. I'm on Team Nan. Lisa's feelings aren't your responsibility, especially with something as personal as calling someone \"mom\". If you find yourself leaning towards your Grandad's point of view, just ask yourself about how inauthentic it would be (so ultimately harmful to both you and Lisa), and/or how problematic it would be if Lisa starts asking for more and more due to her grief, then later due to depression. Keep being respectful and awesome. NTA, again.", "NTA - You\u2019re absolutely right. She wasn\u2019t a mom to you so it makes no sense for you to call her mom. That\u2019s a title that\u2019s earned, and she chose not to put in the work to earn it. She can\u2019t demand it now just because she\u2019s having a hard time. I\u2019m sure you had your own hard times growing up, and she wasn\u2019t around for any of that; you\u2019re being the bigger person by being there for her at all.

I hope Lisa\u2019s doing ok.", "NTA, you don't need to call someone Mom just to make them feel better. She wasn't your mom when you were growing up and it would be a bit weird to start called her that now.   \nYou weren't rude, you didn't deliberately upset her, and you have the right not to force yourself to do things that will make you uncomfortable.", "NTA - you're 100% right about all of this", "Nope NTA. She isn't your mom. She has no right to ask you to call her that. And is incredibly manipulative to be using her husbands death to try to get you to call her mom when that is not your relationship.", "NTA, grief is not an excuse to give someone a pass of disgusting behavior. While the situation obviously in unfortunate, leveraging a tragedy to have you forgive a totally different sin is pretty fucking stupid", "NTA\n\nCalling her mom won't bring Josh back and may give her delusions of a relationship that doesn't exist. Be kind, be firm, and you may have to avoid her for a while.", "Nta. Your grandmother is correct. It sounds like Lisa disregarded you for the bulk of your life and it's time for her to reap what she sowed.", "NTA.", "NTA. Being called \u201cmom\u201d has nothing to do with her husband\u2019s death. In fact, it\u2019s kind of scummy that she\u2019s using his death to try and get something she wants. Frankly, if she wants to be called \u201cMom,\u201d she owes you 23 years of back-effort.", "NTA. Lisa hasn't acted as your mom during any part of your life, and anyway, it's completely up to you to decide how you prefer to address her. \n\nThat title is completely between her and you. The loss of her husband doesn't change that: she can't lay claims to you calling her your 'mother' just because she is bereaved and sad - especially not since *you*, due to her behaviour, have been bereaved of her being your mother for years.\n\nIn short: if she wants to be your mother, she needs to put in quite an effort into bonding with you, and she needs to deserve the title. Widowhood doesn't magically transform her into 'your mother'.", "NTA. Classic absentee parent life hack. Foist your kid off on someone else until they are over 18 and you don't have to worry about supporting them, then pop back into their lives and enjoy all the benefits of devoted adult offspring!\n\n...what do you MEAN you're not going to love and support me unconditionally in my old age?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
