The guys are not really thinking very logically here.", "\"I would not want to eat food cooked on the firepit if he did this.\"\n\nNeither would I.  NTA\n\nScatter them around the cottage, but not in the fire pit.", "NTA. First, gross. Second, what happens when they clean the fire pit? Dad is going to end up in the trash.\n\nThere are several services that will compact ashes into stone. That might be a reasonable compromise if they insist on the fire pit. Dad gets to stay there forever and he doesn't end up in the s'mores.", "NTA for not wanting to use your fil as charcoal.", "No one will be able to use the fire pit because it will eventually need to be cleaned out if they do. How will they distinguish between Dear Old Dad and regular ashes? They won't. So, Dad goes to the Ash Dump Spot, but by bit over the years...Think, People, Think!!!!", "NTA. There are much better places for a loved ones ashes to be than a fire pit where you cook food.\n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA - completely understandable if the ashes are going to end up being used to cook food. Is that definitely what FIL wanted? Can a compromise be made?", "NTA, but I'd probably let him put his ashes where he wanted to, then let the natural cycle of \"Oh, right, we clean out the ashes every 3 months\"  take over.", "Is it at all possible your FIL has a gallows sense of humor?\n\nOur family does and my dad jokes that he wants his ashes scattered at sea\u2026but if we\u2019re too busy to take him we can just flush him and eventually he\u2019ll show up there.\n\nIf FIL is serious-and we know he\u2019s not suffering from a dementia situation-maybe a commemorative plaque shaped like a table could go next to the fire pit so dad\u2019s still part of the fun?\n\nBut I wouldn\u2019t want him in the pit where people are eating. Maybe a reminder that those great family memories will be a thing of the past if you do this because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only one who finds this thought disturbing.", "Nta. Perhaps you could dig a hole in the middle of the pit and bury it then its not really mixed in with the pit but under it?", "That's horrible, that's human remains that's going to leave a residue on anything that's cooked that people will ingest", "\"Ashes, or \"cremains\", are not light and fluffy, but more like gravel, with bits of bones, etc.\"\n\nINFO did you tell your husband this?", "I mean, jeez, I don\u2019t know. That is kind of gross to roast marshmallows over him. But, it was his last request. Yikes. I\u2019d say NAH? But I\u2019m kind of on your side? \n\nCan you compromise, either A) get an outdoor urn and out the remains right next to the fire pit, or B) bury them under the fire pit? \n\nIt sounds like FIL wasn\u2019t really thinking about how his ashes would be kind of extra than ash when he made the request. You might just have to go along with it. Be nice to your husband, his dad died. Yeah it\u2019s a little gross though.", "INFO: would they be contained inside a urn and burried under the ground the firepit is located?. Or does he want them scattered overground with the firewood for everyone to see?. \nThose are two very different things", "\"Ashes from the past for burgers of the future!\" Al Bundy. Absolutely nta.", ">my husband got mad and said sarcastically that \"Oh, so I will tell my dad that he needs to clear his final wishes with you. \"\n\nIf you're married isn't the cottage both your property? I would definitely think you get a say in that. Personally I wouldn't want human remains in a fire pit that I use to make food either. NTA", "NTA-\n\nBuild a different fire pit specifically for this. Put it by the lake with a great view.", "YTA. If the fire pit is as large and deep as you say, it would be trivial to dig down 3-4 feet and place the cremains with the lower layers of fire ash. \n\nNvm that if the cremains are \"like gravel\" as you say, wtf do you think is going to happen to a hotdog or marshmallow cooked over a fire burning on top of that?", "NAH - It seems odd that your FIL wants this but I suppose it's his choice. I don't think you're an arsehole for not wanting it but your reasoning is basically that it's icky. There's no actual skin or tissue left over from a cremation so you know that it's not unhygienic, you just don't like the thought of it. I mean, how is it really any different to having some burnt wood or charcoal in there, it's only ashes?", "YTA - It\u2019s not like his ashes would be sprinkled on your food, also I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t going to be just dumped in the pit but created into the brick or mortar. Sometimes it\u2019s not always about you.", "YTA.  I\u2019m not sure why you haven\u2019t even considered an obvious compromise.  You mentioned that the pit is several feet deep and the ashes are never removed, yes?  So why not suggest he dig a hole in those ashes, add in in his father\u2019s cremains, and cover it back up?  That way you never get his ashes on your food, and his father\u2019s ashes get to stay there forever.\n\nAlso, cremains are not \u201clike gravel\u201d, they are fine with a some very small solids that aren\u2019t even as big as a pea.", "YTA - its not like they\u2019re spreading this over the wood, it goes in the bottom with rest of the ashes", "You don't want to insert yourself, yet you are. This has no impact on you, it's very normal, it's not your family's cottage, it's not like he wants his dead body dumped in the pit for all to see, and it's not like you can't have a big farewell fire for the ashes before it's used again for food. YTA and this is your husband's decision, not yours.", "These were his final wishes, and you\u2019re obligated to see them thru. \nI see your point tho, so soft YTA here. You can build another fire pit to cook on if that makes you feel better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

People do it all the time.", "We are in a very remote area and the firepit ashes are not removed. The firepit is large and deep. Several feet down it is lined with stones. It has been there for decades. Ashes can blow in the wind, of course, but cremains are not like ashes from wood.", "Seriously.  This is morbid as fuck.", "This is what I'm thinking! The ashes will end up being discarded if they go this route. Can they bury his urn nearby instead, or something? So he's always \"there at the firepit\" but not getting disposed of?", "Yes, I did. The problem is that I only learned about the agreement they made with each other after the conversation had taken place, so I think my husband feels like he already made the promise to his dad by the time he had this information.", "Yes, I am sure FIL thinks it would just be extra ashes. I am not sure if FIL has seen cremains before and if he realizes they are not fluffy like ashes from wood. Note: FIL is still alive. Husband is talking with him about what to do when he passes, so there is still a possibility to re-negotiate his final wishes with him. Additional context: someone else in the family recently died so that is the backdrop to these conversations and everyone is raw and sensitive because of that, which makes these conversations particularly emotionally charged.", "Context: the firepit is quite large and deep in the ground. The existing ashes in the pit are deep and I guess you would not really \"see\" his ashes if they were in there, but I would still know they are there.", "This, exactly.", "Apparently it is a massive fire pit that has been there for decades.  Building a new one so grandpa can have an open grave in the old one is ridiculous.", "Ashes from a human body? Very different from ashes from coal or wood.", "OP says they will, in fact, be dumped into the pit as \u201cextra ashes\u201d an an addition to the existing ash pile", "The pit has been there for decades- it is not being built.  He wants the ashes dumped right where the fire wood would go.", "Why is she obligated?", "The guy isn't even dead yet...", "He can still keep his promise to do whatever his dad wants. He\u2019s just ALSO giving him extra information to make sure he knows what will happen with his remains. It might become awkward if FIL finds out your husband is essentially \u201ckeeping this information from him\u201d.", "NTA Go to your FIL.  You could dig and bury the sealed urn underneath the ashes and ground. If hubby isn't willing to do the work of digging with you, and sealing the urn,then it is no deal.\nTell your FIL it would run the fire pit forever. I've gained my shares of boxes of remains, and it would mean I could never eat from the BBQ again.  That's just too gross. Tell your FIL that truth.  \nI don't know how you will keep your husband from sneaking it in, unless you both dig together.\nYou could always hire a handyman to go when mother of you is there, and completely remove and replace everything in the pit. Have new wood burnt, add cousins, etc, to stage a lookalike pit.\nPersonally, I get furious when my final straw is being bent. You could also put a screaming, crying fit to make your husband so uncomfortable, he stops refusing. Normally I would never recommend a tantrum, but eating ground beef cooked in the swirling hot, ashy air would have me pulling out all the stops.\nWe all have the image of light puffy ashes, but, you are correct that they and bones are pulverized, and come in significant size chunks.  Hubbie is clearly having a very hard time thinking about his dad passing.  I would really sit them down both together, because approaching in your own isn't working.\nGood luck. Please consider the handyman solution. You don't want every BBQ to remind you of Halloween.", "No, the new fire pit in a scenic location is for grandpa", "Really? How? I'm not being facetious, I'm genuinely interested.", "Because one is ashes from an inanimate object and the other is from a human body! I think there is a big difference between plants and animals. Also, it's someone they knew and I for one would be horrified to eat part of my dead one..even if it's only ashes."]}
