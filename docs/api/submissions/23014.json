Someone else in the family recently died and that is what is provoking these conversations. I love my husband and my FIL very much. This is such a personal and touchy topic that I feel I need outside advice / perspective.\n\nThe firepit is in-ground, not an above ground metal thing.\n\nEDIT 2: Neither myself nor my husband has yet spoken to FIL yet. I wanted to see reactions from you folks before I decide what to do. I like the compromise solutions being proposed, but even proposing a compromise is sort of inserting myself into the conversation. For the record, I have contributed significantly to the cottage with my own earnings, but I will not bring that up with them as I think that would be an asshole move: I recognize the importance of this place to his family.

My father is currently very sick and won't make it much longer. We talked in length about his wishes: he desired to have his ashes scattered on his favourite place in our family home's garden. My mother, my sister and I strongly objected: my mother (54) doesn't want to keep living in that big house forever, and my sister (18) and me (20) don't know yet what the future will bring and if we want to keep that house forever, as we are quite young. If we scattered his ashes here, we could obviously never sell the property and would be stuck forever with the obligation that comes with it. at first, he was quite angry at us for interfering with his wishes, but he eventually came to understand our perspective, also knowing that things will be difficult enough after his passing. we compromised: his remains will be in an urn, and the urn will be placed in his favourite spot. that way, he can rest where he wants to, and if we ever sell the house, we can make a decision to scatter him anyway or relocate his urn. \n\nI absolutely understand your FIL's wish to be put into this place \u2013 it seems very meaningful to him. But his death doesn't affect him only: who knows what the future will bring. and i also completely understand you not being willing to have him barbecued into your food lol", "NTA. Especially if food would be cooked over that same spot. I can understand maybe a small sprinkle. Maybe look into the possibility of burying those cremains somewhere on the property? Look into laws and such.   \n\n\nAsk if you can work on a compromise. Tell him you recognize the significance but also state why you are concerned. Flip the scenario around to try and help it all make sense. Best of luck.", "Just have the family snort the cremains.", "I am a glassblower and do memorial work. I would suggest having a memorial glass cabachon made that you can adhere to a brick in fire pit. It will include his ashes at the family fire pit and not get lost in all the other debris.", "NTA, maybe compromise and dig a really deep deep hole in the firepit to bury the ashes?", "YTA, just burn the pit a few times before you cook on it if it's that big of a deal, and most ashes actually DON\"T contain bones! Not sure where you got that idea or if you've ever handled ashes in the past. It's not any worse than ashes from a wood fire.", "NTA\n\nyeah i'd feel uncomfortable cooking food over my FIL", "Very good idea!!", ">ashes do not have bone in them\n\nThey do, actually. In fact, \"ashes\" or human cremains, are pretty much all pulverized bones.", "Ashes from cremation are almost entirely made up of bones. The soft tissues burn but it is the bones that remain.

OP doesn't sound like a vegetarian after all, so they should have less problems with animal parts.", "NTA.

So they are not in the fire pit, but still a part of it.", "NTA food is cooked there, not a place that should be someone\u2019s final resting place. Maybe dig a hole & bury him near the fire pit? Maybe in his favorite place to sit near the fire pit? But not IN the fire pit", "Visited my dad last yr. Went and visited Hell MI.

You'll still need to work on your reaction, but it will be just about your reaction, not about actual contact with the cremains at that point. \n\nI think YWBTA if you straight out say no, both to your FIL and to your husband. But there is usually a solution that meets everyone's needs if people are willing to look at what is most important to them and compromise on what doesn't matter as much.", "Someone suggested having his cremains made into a brick or stone that could be part of the firepit.
