YTA and this is your husband's decision, not yours.", "These were his final wishes, and you\u2019re obligated to see them thru. \nI see your point tho, so soft YTA here.

Additional context: someone else in the family recently died so that is the backdrop to these conversations and everyone is raw and sensitive because of that, which makes these conversations particularly emotionally charged.", "Context: the firepit is quite large and deep in the ground.

I've gained my shares of boxes of remains, and it would mean I could never eat from the BBQ again.  That's just too gross. Tell your FIL that truth.  \nI don't know how you will keep your husband from sneaking it in, unless you both dig together.\nYou could always hire a handyman to go when mother of you is there, and completely remove and replace everything in the pit. Have new wood burnt, add cousins, etc, to stage a lookalike pit.\nPersonally, I get furious when my final straw is being bent. You could also put a screaming, crying fit to make your husband so uncomfortable, he stops refusing. Normally I would never recommend a tantrum, but eating ground beef cooked in the swirling hot, ashy air would have me pulling out all the stops.\nWe all have the image of light puffy ashes, but, you are correct that they and bones are pulverized, and come in significant size chunks.  Hubbie is clearly having a very hard time thinking about his dad passing.  I would really sit them down both together, because approaching in your own isn't working.\nGood luck.

Just go along with it and immediately light up a fire, once out, scoop all them ashes and yeet them in the trash, where this idea lives.", "NTA I\u2019d get them put into one of those cool memorial solar lights/lawn ornament things! It would be great around the campfire and he could remain with you guys always! There are some pretty cool ones out there specifically for this purpose. They can also turn him into sparkly glasslike gems that you can hang like wind chimes. These are much better ideas than getting a mouthful of extra crispy grandpa.", "How bout a compromise so Dad doesn't end up in the trash eventually. Clean out the fire pit and bury the ashes right under it. Dad will still be at the fire as he wants and you don't have to be grossed out. They can't affect it from underground.", "NTA\nYour Husband is just being sensitive cause he wants to honor his Dad\u2019s last wishes.  He needs to talk to his Dad.  Why would the Dad want this?  Unless, of course, he thinks this would be funny.", "NTA, would a compromise work? There are companies that can take the ashes and turn them into something else, like adding them to a potted plant you could put on the property for him. I think there's a company that can make a decorative stone as well.
