As I was carving the wellington she noticed it wasn't as red as she would like and immediately without saying anything turned on the air fryer and pulled out some chicken nuggets from the freezer. She then said I shouldn't serve her any, as she wouldn't like it, and thus shouldn't have to eat it. This made me feel like garbage, and made me a little angry. \n\nEveryone who ate the wellington really enjoyed it, and despite it being overcooked it was still quite juicy. \n\nWe had all mostly finished eating when my dad came home, as I was serving him a piece he noticed my sister was eating chicken nuggets and asked what that was about. I said it was cause she was a dick and wasn't even willing to try my food since it wasn't cooked to her preference. \nMy sister immediately started crying and asked what she was supposed to do.\n\n \"Eat something I wouldn't like?!?\" \n\nAs if it would've killed her to eat meat cooked 5 degrees higher than she prefers. \n\nShe went on about how I just wanted to make her feel bad. I told her it made me feel bad that she didn't even try it, and she said I was being dramatic. \nI put a lot of love and care into making a nice meal for my family, and whilst yes it was overcooked I feel she could've eaten it out of courtesy or at least tried it before making something else for herself. \n\nEveryone at the table except my GF and Dad sided with her, saying I was being dramatic and mean. \n\nSo AITA for calling her out for not even trying something I spent about 4 hours making?", "created_utc": 1702587209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18iif1m/aita_for_saying_my_sister_was_being_a_dick_by_not/", "score": 1625, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Loved one takes time and effort, slightly overcooks steak, is sad about it - I sympathise, thank them for the effort, eat it and tell them I enjoyed it and I'm sure it will be even better next time when they get it right.

Probably shouldn't have called her named but otherwise NTA", "Nta, I am honestly shocked at how many people are saying otherwise. If someone cooks you something, all of you would ACTUALLY blatantly be like \u201cew nope\u201d because the meat is literally 10 degrees hotter???

NTA, sister can fuck off.", "NTA. Anyone that would rather eat air fryed nuggets instead of a (bit) overdone Beef Wellington has probably no taste buds anyway.", "NTA.\n\nYou have the wrong family.  In my family, NOBODY would have ever made chicken nuggets because they thought a tricky, hard-to-cook meal was over-cooked.  My family was brought up to have manners, care about others, and to have empathy.\n\nYour sister has poor manners and cares only about herself.  She's 21 and acted like she was four years old.", "Your sister said *you* were being dramatic? What does she call her performative flounce of going for the nuggets before she\u2019s even tried your food, then?

It's not like she has some kind of serious aversion to what was made or has an actual disorder that would prevent her from eating it. It would have been a show of support to eat even a bite. But she could not muster this up for her own sister, which is very rude, and then she used tears to make herself seem like the victim in this situation. I have eaten food many many times that I didn't want to in order to show support for someone. \n\nNTA and never cook for her ungrateful ass again.", "Your sister is the one who is a drama queen.

Being upset about it is okay, calling her a dick and starting drama over it is not. She knows what she likes. She knows she wouldn\u2019t have like your beef wellington and chose to eat something she knew she\u2019d like. Stop making it about you.

Especially when someone went out of their way to do it as an act of kindness to you. She should have stayed quiet to show appreciation and enjoyed the probably 4/5 experience instead of 5/5 if it was cooked to the desired doneness.", "Wait, SHE cried, but YOU'RE being dramatic?\n\nShe was rude. You called her on it. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's actually really insulting to you that she didn't even bother to try to eat it. AND IT WAS HOMEMADE BEEF WELLINGTON. This isn't about being picky. It doesn't feel like its about being picky to me. It is a privilege to be served that kind of meal at home. It is a privilege to even have another option in the freezer to eat because it wasn't cooked to her her preference.  A fucking *privilege*. There are literally people dying because they don't have access to food much less be picky about how it's prepared. \n\nHow are you even being dramatic? Seriously I don't see how. You were already upset it wasn't cooked perfectly. You sat through the meal while you were actively being insulted by a guest, and they have the audacity to say *you're* the one being dramatic?! Nah, fuck that.", "NTA. We are teaching our kids (6 and 8) that when someone makes something special for you, you are obligated to try it, assuming it\u2019s not something you\u2019re allergic to. You don\u2019t have to eat tons of it if you don\u2019t like it, but a good faith effort is expected. Another thing we are teaching them is that just because you don\u2019t like something, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t eat it. We eat things we don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t like all the time. It\u2019s not ideal, but it happens. \n\nWhat your sister did was incredibly rude. That was a really thoughtful, time consuming, and expensive meal you made for everyone. She was being dramatic by not even trying it before making herself chicken nuggets.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister sounds pretty immature about food and manners,  sure. \n\nBut as someone who went through culinary school, worked in the industry,  and is still involved with a chef? Take my advice. As entitled as you feel your family was,  it is nothing compared to how customers will behave in restaurants.  Take the compliments,  take the learning from the criticism,  and move forward with your craft.  Your ego has no place there.  If you let it make the calls,  this industry will go out of its way to crush you.  \n\nYou're showing entitlement as well,  to your sister's palate and preferences. In a family,  it's common to eat whatever was made for you, especially without other options. Less so these days.  In the industry, that expectation will hurt your ability to adapt, improve,  and think of solutions on the fly.  The most common word I've heard to describe freshly minted culinary grads is \"insufferable.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong.  You can still be upset when people are rude.  Chefs don't have a reputation for surliness for nothing.  But your feelings take second place to professional accountability and getting things done. If you need to scream or cry, you get a couple minutes to hide in the walk in fridge to get it out.  \n\nSchool gives you a huge foundation and edge over people hired from the street with no formal training.  But school is that - a foundation. The job is where the urgency and ability to learn on the fly is needed.  It will be a lot easier to rise through the ranks if you stop being defensive about criticism,  and just start taking notes on as many tips, techniques,  and opinions you can get, and fix whatever they want fixed the way they want it fixed.  Skip the anger.  It doesn't help. \n\nAnd for wellington,  try to go for a rareness below what you're aiming for,  the pastry encasement will increase the carry over cooking time a bit.  Aim for medium rare if you want medium.", "NTA but also a bit ESH -  your sister sounds childish and rude. When someone spends hours cooking for a family meal/gathering, you at least try the food out of common courtesy.  Even if it is not 100% to your liking, you can be an adult and suck it up.\n\nHowever, calling her a dick and starting a fight over it was a bit much", "YTA. She doesn't have to eat it. She immediately communicated she didn't want it and made herself her own food without placing any extra expectations on you. Dogging on her for being an adult and communicating is yuck. Acts of love don't come with strings attached.", "Not. You were being dramatic but she wasn\u2019t? Really?", "NTA.  Sure, you can't force her to eat it. It is her choice to act like a 5 year old brat and she is entitled to that. It is completely within her rights to be a complete asshole who lacks manners", "YTA for how you handled it, which is linked to the question you asked about calling her a dick. Completely lacking in grace. What? She hurt your feelings by making a personal choice not to eat overcooked food, so you call her a dick. \n\nYou can\u2019t make people eat your cooking. Seems a funny way to show your love if you make out like it\u2019s compulsory people eat your food. You chose to spend 4 hours cooking. No one made you turn up and do so. \n\nPersonally speaking I\u2019d have not eaten it either but that\u2019s cause I\u2019m CICO and the idea of something that calorific that I wouldn\u2019t even enjoy properly is just nope.\n\nHer choice not to eat the food wasn\u2019t about you.", "NTA. Someone complaining about Beef Wellington being overcooked is eating chicken nuggets instead? This is not about the food, she\u2019s being an ungracious dick.", "ESH\n\nYou asked, she said no. Pushing beyond that makes you an AH.  \n\nI don't enjoy overcooked beef either, but I probably would have taken a bite for my brother before making myself a sandwich.  To some folks, overcooked beef has a horrific texture that turns what should be enjoyable into a punishment.", "You can\u2019t force someone to eat. You\u2019re allowed to be a little sad but you aren\u2019t allowed to lash out because you\u2019re cooking went slighting over, because let\u2019s be honest you we\u2019re already quite upset and so you directed all of it at her when she did nothing wrong by not wanting to eat something.", "Please don't listen to the people saying you're the asshole, these people have no idea what it's like be a cook. Your sister an asshole, I would never cook for her again. This would never happen in my family, but all my family cooks.", "YTA. And for everyone saying she should have tried a few bites....do you really think OP would have reacted any better to her trying it and saying she didn't care for it and then making some chicken nuggets?\u00a0 So then we are progressing to sister has to eat the whole meal of something she doesn't like to appease OP and so he doesn't call her names.\u00a0 And for some that likes their meat rare to medium rare, having beef cooked medium well to well-done is a pretty big difference.", "Info: is sis a picky eater or has food sensibilities?

Don't cast your pearls before swine.", "Don\u2019t cook for your family any more. Also, develop a thicker skin.

It\u2019s disgusting. I tried for family and I just end up not finishing my plate and having everyone asking why I am not eating.\n\nThere is no winning with people like you.

I have never been able to get more than a bite or two down and it\u2019s a miserable experience. I can\u2019t smile my way through that and pretend to be enjoying any part of it. I\u2019m not that good of an actress. \n\nSo yeah\u2026 I would have taken one look at that meal and probably would have said no thanks. So I would have opted for the chicken nuggets too, without trying something I know I\u2019d struggle to have a polite response about. \n\nThe sister\u2019s mistake was crying but it sounds like OP was being an asshole anyway.

I don\u2019t eat beef products at all because i don\u2019t like the taste of beef and i can NOT force myself to eat it. I visited my mom a few months ago and she forgot i don\u2019t eat beef and make spaghetti with meat sauce. I really did not feel like doing the stupid dance where i decline politely, she complains and guilt trips me, and it\u2019s a whole ordeal so i just silently ate it and then had to run and go puke a minute later because even though i was able to swallow it down my body still rejected it. My body does not like it. \n\nPeople really need to understand that people will politely decline food for ALL kids of reasons that have nothing to do with the person offering the food.

When I refuse to eat something, it's not because I just find it mildly unpleasant, it's because trying to eat it will most likely make me gag so hard I throw up. And even if I manage to get it down, I normally end up throwing up within the next 5 minutes because of how gross it is to me.\n\nI'll try anything once - I've had chicken feet, most internal organs, sea cucumber, etc - but once I know I can't handle it, I will flat out refuse to eat it no matter what. It's kind of annoying when people just assume I'm a picky eater because I'm unwilling to try things, when I really just don't enjoy puking in front of other people because I ate a mushroom or something lol. \n\nI used to feel pressured to eat food I couldn't handle bc of the way people act when you're picky about food, but then I threw up in front of everyone at a dinner party bc I couldn't keep it down long enough to make it to the bathroom, and that was WAY more embarrassing than just politely turning it down in the first place lol", "I only learnt about ARFID recently.

My absolute favorite meal is raw squid covered in flying fish eggs paired with bbq eel. Followed by duck, pho with filled with tripe and tendons, and steak tartar. I'm an adventurous eater. But that means I've also been exposed to good cooking and bad. By 20, I could identify a badly cooked piece of meat and knew it would be dry, tough, and tasteless just by looking.

No she didn\u2019t LEGALLY have to eat the damn Wellington. But what would it have cost her to do? Nothing.
