As I was carving the wellington she noticed it wasn't as red as she would like and immediately without saying anything turned on the air fryer and pulled out some chicken nuggets from the freezer. She then said I shouldn't serve her any, as she wouldn't like it, and thus shouldn't have to eat it. This made me feel like garbage, and made me a little angry. \n\nEveryone who ate the wellington really enjoyed it, and despite it being overcooked it was still quite juicy. \n\nWe had all mostly finished eating when my dad came home, as I was serving him a piece he noticed my sister was eating chicken nuggets and asked what that was about. I said it was cause she was a dick and wasn't even willing to try my food since it wasn't cooked to her preference. \nMy sister immediately started crying and asked what she was supposed to do.\n\n \"Eat something I wouldn't like?!?\" \n\nAs if it would've killed her to eat meat cooked 5 degrees higher than she prefers. \n\nShe went on about how I just wanted to make her feel bad. I told her it made me feel bad that she didn't even try it, and she said I was being dramatic. \nI put a lot of love and care into making a nice meal for my family, and whilst yes it was overcooked I feel she could've eaten it out of courtesy or at least tried it before making something else for herself. \n\nEveryone at the table except my GF and Dad sided with her, saying I was being dramatic and mean. \n\nSo AITA for calling her out for not even trying something I spent about 4 hours making?", "created_utc": 1702587209, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18iif1m/aita_for_saying_my_sister_was_being_a_dick_by_not/", "score": 527, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Loved one takes time and effort, slightly overcooks steak, is sad about it - I sympathise, thank them for the effort, eat it and tell them I enjoyed it and I'm sure it will be even better next time when they get it right.

Probably shouldn't have called her named but otherwise NTA", "Nta, I am honestly shocked at how many people are saying otherwise. If someone cooks you something, all of you would ACTUALLY blatantly be like \u201cew nope\u201d because the meat is literally 10 degrees hotter???

NTA, sister can fuck off.", "NTA. Anyone that would rather eat air fryed nuggets instead of a (bit) overdone Beef Wellington has probably no taste buds anyway.", "NTA.\n\nYou have the wrong family.  In my family, NOBODY would have ever made chicken nuggets because they thought a tricky, hard-to-cook meal was over-cooked.  My family was brought up to have manners, care about others, and to have empathy.\n\nYour sister has poor manners and cares only about herself.  She's 21 and acted like she was four years old.", "Your sister said *you* were being dramatic? What does she call her performative flounce of going for the nuggets before she\u2019s even tried your food, then?

It's not like she has some kind of serious aversion to what was made or has an actual disorder that would prevent her from eating it. It would have been a show of support to eat even a bite. But she could not muster this up for her own sister, which is very rude, and then she used tears to make herself seem like the victim in this situation. I have eaten food many many times that I didn't want to in order to show support for someone. \n\nNTA and never cook for her ungrateful ass again.", "Your sister is the one who is a drama queen.

Being upset about it is okay, calling her a dick and starting drama over it is not. She knows what she likes. She knows she wouldn\u2019t have like your beef wellington and chose to eat something she knew she\u2019d like. Stop making it about you.

Especially when someone went out of their way to do it as an act of kindness to you. She should have stayed quiet to show appreciation and enjoyed the probably 4/5 experience instead of 5/5 if it was cooked to the desired doneness.", "Wait, SHE cried, but YOU'RE being dramatic?\n\nShe was rude. You called her on it. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's actually really insulting to you that she didn't even bother to try to eat it. AND IT WAS HOMEMADE BEEF WELLINGTON. This isn't about being picky. It doesn't feel like its about being picky to me. It is a privilege to be served that kind of meal at home. It is a privilege to even have another option in the freezer to eat because it wasn't cooked to her her preference.  A fucking *privilege*. There are literally people dying because they don't have access to food much less be picky about how it's prepared. \n\nHow are you even being dramatic? Seriously I don't see how. You were already upset it wasn't cooked perfectly. You sat through the meal while you were actively being insulted by a guest, and they have the audacity to say *you're* the one being dramatic?! Nah, fuck that.", "NTA. We are teaching our kids (6 and 8) that when someone makes something special for you, you are obligated to try it, assuming it\u2019s not something you\u2019re allergic to. You don\u2019t have to eat tons of it if you don\u2019t like it, but a good faith effort is expected. Another thing we are teaching them is that just because you don\u2019t like something, it doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t eat it. We eat things we don\u2019t want to or don\u2019t like all the time. It\u2019s not ideal, but it happens. \n\nWhat your sister did was incredibly rude. That was a really thoughtful, time consuming, and expensive meal you made for everyone. She was being dramatic by not even trying it before making herself chicken nuggets.", "ESH. \n\nYour sister sounds pretty immature about food and manners,  sure. \n\nBut as someone who went through culinary school, worked in the industry,  and is still involved with a chef? Take my advice. As entitled as you feel your family was,  it is nothing compared to how customers will behave in restaurants.  Take the compliments,  take the learning from the criticism,  and move forward with your craft.  Your ego has no place there.  If you let it make the calls,  this industry will go out of its way to crush you.  \n\nYou're showing entitlement as well,  to your sister's palate and preferences. In a family,  it's common to eat whatever was made for you, especially without other options. Less so these days.  In the industry, that expectation will hurt your ability to adapt, improve,  and think of solutions on the fly.  The most common word I've heard to describe freshly minted culinary grads is \"insufferable.\"\n\nDon't get me wrong.  You can still be upset when people are rude.  Chefs don't have a reputation for surliness for nothing.  But your feelings take second place to professional accountability and getting things done. If you need to scream or cry, you get a couple minutes to hide in the walk in fridge to get it out.  \n\nSchool gives you a huge foundation and edge over people hired from the street with no formal training.  But school is that - a foundation. The job is where the urgency and ability to learn on the fly is needed.  It will be a lot easier to rise through the ranks if you stop being defensive about criticism,  and just start taking notes on as many tips, techniques,  and opinions you can get, and fix whatever they want fixed the way they want it fixed.  Skip the anger.  It doesn't help. \n\nAnd for wellington,  try to go for a rareness below what you're aiming for,  the pastry encasement will increase the carry over cooking time a bit.  Aim for medium rare if you want medium.", "NTA but also a bit ESH -  your sister sounds childish and rude. When someone spends hours cooking for a family meal/gathering, you at least try the food out of common courtesy.  Even if it is not 100% to your liking, you can be an adult and suck it up.\n\nHowever, calling her a dick and starting a fight over it was a bit much", "YTA. She doesn't have to eat it. She immediately communicated she didn't want it and made herself her own food without placing any extra expectations on you. Dogging on her for being an adult and communicating is yuck. Acts of love don't come with strings attached.", "Not. You were being dramatic but she wasn\u2019t? Really?", "NTA.  Sure, you can't force her to eat it. It is her choice to act like a 5 year old brat and she is entitled to that. It is completely within her rights to be a complete asshole who lacks manners", "YTA for how you handled it, which is linked to the question you asked about calling her a dick. Completely lacking in grace. What? She hurt your feelings by making a personal choice not to eat overcooked food, so you call her a dick. \n\nYou can\u2019t make people eat your cooking. Seems a funny way to show your love if you make out like it\u2019s compulsory people eat your food. You chose to spend 4 hours cooking. No one made you turn up and do so. \n\nPersonally speaking I\u2019d have not eaten it either but that\u2019s cause I\u2019m CICO and the idea of something that calorific that I wouldn\u2019t even enjoy properly is just nope.\n\nHer choice not to eat the food wasn\u2019t about you.", "NTA. Someone complaining about Beef Wellington being overcooked is eating chicken nuggets instead? This is not about the food, she\u2019s being an ungracious dick.", "ESH\n\nYou asked, she said no. Pushing beyond that makes you an AH.  \n\nI don't enjoy overcooked beef either, but I probably would have taken a bite for my brother before making myself a sandwich.  To some folks, overcooked beef has a horrific texture that turns what should be enjoyable into a punishment.", "You can\u2019t force someone to eat. You\u2019re allowed to be a little sad but you aren\u2019t allowed to lash out because you\u2019re cooking went slighting over, because let\u2019s be honest you we\u2019re already quite upset and so you directed all of it at her when she did nothing wrong by not wanting to eat something.", "Please don't listen to the people saying you're the asshole, these people have no idea what it's like be a cook. Your sister an asshole, I would never cook for her again. This would never happen in my family, but all my family cooks.", "YTA. And for everyone saying she should have tried a few bites....do you really think OP would have reacted any better to her trying it and saying she didn't care for it and then making some chicken nuggets?\u00a0 So then we are progressing to sister has to eat the whole meal of something she doesn't like to appease OP and so he doesn't call her names.\u00a0 And for some that likes their meat rare to medium rare, having beef cooked medium well to well-done is a pretty big difference.", "Info: is sis a picky eater or has food sensibilities?

Don't cast your pearls before swine.", "Don\u2019t cook for your family any more. Also, develop a thicker skin.

It\u2019s disgusting. I tried for family and I just end up not finishing my plate and having everyone asking why I am not eating.\n\nThere is no winning with people like you.

Why is she forced to eat something she has no interest in eating and thinks she won't like?", "If you were serving something you feel shitty about (OP's words) would you be offended if someone didn't want to try it?", "It can be 'allowed' whilst also disrespectful. it's disrespectful to not even try it when it's a food you actually like but done just slightly over what is optimal for you. \n\nJust like those people who refuse to try a meal first without lathering it in sauces. \n\nIt's *extremely* disrespectful to immediately make a show of grabbing the most processed food bar hot dogs and begin making it.", "Making a food herself >> demanding he make her something.", "so she should skip lunch then?", "Omg hi gluten free friend. Did you know they make gluten free Dino chicken nuggets? https://yummydinobuddies.com/product/gluten-free they\u2019re pretty good!", "You have to be gracious about all the things you don't like.

And even Gordon behaves himself according to the setting.", "This is absolutely it. Cows hurt worse than my beef still survive. I like to cook and I'm good, but who hasn't gone a little over and still ate the product? Unlike some things undercooked, it isn't a risk and OP made something far less well done than a lot of cuts are best served.", "She DID insult the meal. Not just by not trying it, but declaring she wouldn't like it without trying it and then making a fuss when OP dared to call it out.", "using a toddler\u2019s development as comparison for poor behavior makes a lot more sense than using your child\u2019s autism as a context-less gotcha on internet randos.", "No, I grew up eating \"slightly overdone\" pot roast with no moisture and biscuits you could break a window with. Large pieces of beef that are overcooked in fluctuating temperature for too long of a period are absolutely terrible and far less palatable than garbage chicken nuggets.\n\nOP knew he didn't have the right equipment, but made the dish anyway. I was kind to him. You, though, decided to take great offense at what I said. So. You know what's really unloving? Forcing someone to partake in something you botchef just because you made an effort. \n\nSometimes, dishes don't turn our. Medium well middle and really well done outer on beef wellington isn't \"slightly over cooked,\" it's 30 minutes burnt. There is a huge texture issue there. I've messed up meals that took me all day before. So I make something quicker and more simple for my family and then pitch my mistake. Because they don't need to pretend that I did well for the sake of my pride.\n\nSo, I've covered \"unlovable.\" How about \"unreasonable?\" You know what's unreasonable? Making someone feel like shit for what they choose to eat. If the sister doesn't like well done red meat, why force her to eat it? If she were a vegetarian should she still eat it? He made the same effort. If she didn't like beef at all, should she still eat it? It took him *four hours* after all. Parents on this exact subreddit are told that forcing a kid to eat something is abusive. And that manipulation is too. But trying to manipulate your sister into eating something is a-ok and she's an ah for not going along?\n\nI love my mother. But she's a terrible cook and I will not eat her food.

Her tongue was not given that same test. And her being allowed to chose other food doesn't make her immune from the consequence of offending.

This boils down to a consent issue. It doesn't matter how much time or effort he spent on it. His sister didn't ask for it, and didn't want it.

The kitchen was likely a mess after OP was cooking in it all day, AND the rest of the family was already ready to sit down and eat. It makes sense to grab something simple and quick in that scenario. \n\nNobody is ever obligated to eat food you want them to eat and a nice gesture is no longer nice when you belittle and insult someone for not wanting that gesture.", "I never suggested that as a solution because it\u2019s not a solution.

Second best answer here.  :)", "You can gabble on all you want but it's still disrespectful not to even try it and there's a reason most people in this thread have agreed. You're not going to change my mind on this and I'm glad I was brought up with basic manners to - even had I ABSOLUTELY MUST felt I had to decline- not grab a bag of nuggets in front of them.", "And sometimes people can be grown-ups and not give a shit what someone else does or doesn't want to eat.

Sometimes my pasta is a little softer than al dente. Do you know what I do in that situation?\n\nI thank the person for cooking me a meal, eat my food and get the fuck on with my life.

It was a lunch he prepped, prepared and served. A lunch everyone knew about because they were all there. Having basic manners is clearly something you lack, which is an embarrassing thing to admit online. Again, taking a bite won\u2019t kill you.. that alone makes her the asshole but an adult bursting into tears (as the older sister which is immature in itself) because someone called her out for being rude makes her an even more of an asshole. Being a self described perfectionist and narcissist doesn\u2019t automatically make you the asshole all the time. In this instance he wasn\u2019t\u2026 and since you can\u2019t seem to grasp that.. you can lead a horse to water but you can\u2019t make him drink.", "If that was where her reaction ended, I would agree with you completely. Alas, she took it dramatic levels.", "I guess I don't get it. It was a dick move. And they are siblings. Do siblings not call each other out for being dicks when they are being dicks? She was a major AH. He got hurt, he expressed his hurt through a word she didn't like. But I am not a turn the cheek person. First shots were fired, call it like it is.", "crying after her brother and father insult her right in front of her for simply feeding herself is not dramatic. OP and his dad were being AHs to her and then blaming the sister for being upset. OP already said themselves they\u2019re sensitive to rejection, he took his own issues out on her", "I read the situation differently than you did, and I haven't seen all OPs comments.\n\nIt came across to me as she turned on waterworks immediately when their father agreed she should have tried the dish to make herself the victim. Like OP is allowed to be upset she wouldn't even try it, although he could have said something other than calling her a dick, but it feels like she escalated things with her reaction.\n\nIt doesn't sound to me like OP and their dad were being assholes, but I often call people dicks or something similar in a light hearted way, so maybe I'm applying that to this situation and viewing it in a more positive light because of it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
