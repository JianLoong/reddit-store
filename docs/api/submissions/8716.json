Wedding planning has been a little bit hard because we butt heads over the budget at first. I was raised that parents pay toward their children's wedding, if not outright paying for all of it, but he was raised differently. He wanted us to host our wedding based on what we could afford ourselves and if our parents chose to help pay any of the costs or give us a monetary gift early, then we could add to that. I wanted to plan our wedding based on what us, my parents, and his parents could afford. At first, my parents were going to match what his parents payed into it but when I told them his parents wouldn't be contributing, they offered to pay what I was putting in and a little more than that. I could tell they weren't happy about this and to be blunt, neither was I, because personally, I can't imagine parents not wanting to help their child have a good wedding.\n\nI asked him to please ask his parents to contribute but he wouldn't budge. He thinks because neither of his siblings received help paying for their wedding it'd be unfair if he did. He says if they want to help, then they'll offer it. \n\nI don't think it's fair that my parents have helped pay but his parents haven't. For awhile I thought, what if they wanted to help pay but were waiting to be asked? Our honeymoon is going to cost less than our wedding so I approached my in-laws about perhaps helping pay toward that amount instead. I figure this way, they are still contributing in some way but with a significantly smaller sum and that could even be their wedding gift to us. That's how I presented it to them and they told me that they would think about it. When my fiance got home we started arguing because they told him I asked his parents about paying toward our honeymoon. I just want him to understand how unfair this is between our parents.", "created_utc": 1675109541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pco1p/aita_for_asking_my_inlaws_to_help_pay_toward_our/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hopefully your fiance sees the major red flags you're waving in his face before he gets locked into a legal partnership with someone so entitled.", "YTA - If you are speaking traditionally, the Father of the Bride (that's you) pays for the wedding in full. Traditionally speaking of course. So if you're going to impose beliefs and traditions, at least get it right. \n\nHis parents, and yours as well honestly, don't owe either of you a penny. Not in this day and age. Just be happy with what you get and move on. If they say no, accept it and move on. \n\nMy wife's parents were well off enough to cover our wedding, my mother, a single mother at that, had hardly a dime to her name. There is no way she would have been able to contribute financially, and it would have been of poor taste to ask otherwise from her.", "You're right, it is unfair. Neither sets of parents should be asked to pay. You're 26, not 16. \n\nYou're focusing on the wedding instead of the marriage... you went behind your finance's back expressly against his wishes, and asked his parents for money. Have you no shame? You're behaving like a bratty teenager, not a woman who's ready for marriage. \n\nApologize and budget for a wedding you and your fiance can afford.

If you are already willing to go behind his back for something like this before you're married, how is he to trust you afterward?

Your fianc\u00e9 told you that he would not be asking his parents to contribute to the wedding, and he told you why he believed that the request was inappropriate. That \"no\" was a complete answer. But rather than accept that answer, you decided to do an end run and ask for help for the honeymoon instead. What possessed you to think that was a good idea? \n\nYour behavior does not bode well for your marriage. The two of you have some cultural differences; that's cool. Know what's not cool? Going around your fianc\u00e9's back and doing what you did merely because you think that your cultural norms should prevail. Want to make sure that this man remains your fianc\u00e9?

You sound spoiled.\n\nYou asked them for something major, not a tiny favor. I bet they feel slightly shamed for not being able to contribute the way your family is.

Your wedding is your responsibility, not the responsibility of your parents or his parents.

Your parents may have set aside money over the years in anticipation of this day, but his parents did not.

What makes your wedding so special to receive funding for it?\n\nYour parents have offered to pay, which is very generous of them, so let them give you what they can afford and then you guys pay for the rest of it. \n\nIt isn't unfair to your parents at all because like I said, there is no obligation for it.

Wedding planning has been a little bit hard because we butt heads over the budget at first. I was raised that parents pay toward their children's wedding, if not outright paying for all of it, but he was raised differently. He wanted us to host our wedding based on what we could afford ourselves and if our parents chose to help pay any of the costs or give us a monetary gift early, then we could add to that. I wanted to plan our wedding based on what us, my parents, and his parents could afford. At first, my parents were going to match what his parents payed into it but when I told them his parents wouldn't be contributing, they offered to pay what I was putting in and a little more than that. I could tell they weren't happy about this and to be blunt, neither was I, because personally, I can't imagine parents not wanting to help their child have a good wedding.\n\nI asked him to please ask his parents to contribute but he wouldn't budge. He thinks because neither of his siblings received help paying for their wedding it'd be unfair if he did. He says if they want to help, then they'll offer it. \n\nI don't think it's fair that my parents have helped pay but his parents haven't. For awhile I thought, what if they wanted to help pay but were waiting to be asked? Our honeymoon is going to cost less than our wedding so I approached my in-laws about perhaps helping pay toward that amount instead. I figure this way, they are still contributing in some way but with a significantly smaller sum and that could even be their wedding gift to us. That's how I presented it to them and they told me that they would think about it. When my fiance got home we started arguing because they told him I asked his parents about paying toward our honeymoon. I just want him to understand how unfair this is between our parents.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You aren't entitled to other people's possessions just because your parents told you you were when you were little.\n\n> personally, I can't imagine parents not wanting to help their child have a good wedding.\n\nYou can re-use that logic in all situations to explain why your parents should always pay for everything at all times. Ultimately, just like how them not paying your grocery bill doesn't mean they want you to eat poorly and them not paying your heating bill doesn't mean they want you to freeze, it's completely unfair to equate them not paying for your wedding with them not wanting their child to have a good wedding.

What's fair is that each person does what they want with their own possessions. Also... this isn't going to be the first time this happens... what about christmas... what about a baby shower... etc. People are going to spend different amount on gifts... you can't take this stance that everybody has to spend a similar amount or they don't care. Stop being so shallow and understand that care can come in ways other than money...\n\n> For awhile I thought, what if they wanted to help pay but were waiting to be asked?\n\nGiven the point of gifts, people are usually pretty happy to offer them without being explicitly asked. Also, given the etiquette about not pressuring/demanding people (in the way you did) it would generally be discouraged to just ask for a particular size of gift. Lastly though... if you had this thought about what they might be feeling/thinking, wouldn't your fiance who knew them his whole life be a good person to run this thought by? The fact that you tried this without checking with him first makes it seem like you wanted to avoid the possibility of him saying \"no, they definitely aren't thinking that.\"\n\n> Our honeymoon is going to cost less than our wedding\n\nIt doesn't matter. It's rude for you to determine the size of gift somebody is supposed to give you.\n\n> I figure this way, they are still contributing in some way but with a significantly smaller sum and that could even be their wedding gift to us.\n\nPresumably, they'd be \"contributing in some way\" with the gift they bought you anyways. It's not like you created some opportunity for them here where they were unable to \"contribute\" unless you offered...\n\n> I just want him to understand how unfair this is between our parents.\n\nIt started out fair/balanced when neither contributed. Your parents chose to make it imbalanced by contributing and they did not have to do that. If their priority is equality, they could have not contributed. Just because your parents chose to imbalance it doesn't mean their action dictates what his parents have to do in response.\n\nWhy is the only \"fair\" scenario the one where everybody does what you and your family want?\n\nIsn't it unfair to put his parents in this awkward position where they were asked directly for a substantial gift that you were told was beyond what they or your fiance were likely able to give? Now, they're going to feel terrible saying no to this thing they don't want to do.\n\nIf my fiance acted the way you did, I'd be extremely embarrassed at the poor etiquette of directly asking for a specific huge gift and I'd seriously rethink the marriage that she just skipped over how I felt and asked anyways.", ">I don't think it's fair that my parents have helped pay but his parents haven't.\n\nWtf is this nonsense.
