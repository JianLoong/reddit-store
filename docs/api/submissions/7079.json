{"id": 7079, "submission_id": "1095ljq", "title": "AITA for eating the beef steak?", "selftext": "  \n\nSorry for any grammar/spelling mistakes, english is not my native language.\n\nMe (22f) and my boyfriend (24) were invited to my MIL and FIL for a barbecue. It is not a long time since my BF doesn't live with them anymore (we moved in together around 2 months ago and are very often invited) and I always struggled how the MIL behaves toward her sons. My BF has a brother who is also 24 like me and still lives in the house with them. She was always very kind and sweet to me, but she is a very passionate mother and does *everything* for her boys.\n\nWhen we are invited for dinner it's always the same. She prepares the food, puts everything on the table and when everyone is finished, she is the one who cleans the kitchen and clears the table. I've spoke several times to my BF about that because I wasn't raised like that. (At my parents house were chores for everyone, not only for the women and especially not only for my mom). So I often said to him that it bothers me, that she has to do everything (and because I can't stand there and do nothing, I always help her out) but my FIL, BIL and my BF leave their dishes on the table and go outside to smoke.\n\nSo, at this particular barbecue dinner, she was in the kitchen, preparing the salad an set the table, the *men* were in charge of the meat, so they're outside, smoking, grilling and drinking beer. As the meat was finished, everyone sat down exept for me and my MIL because we still had some things to do in the kitchen. As we sat down, everyone at the table had already some food on their plates. There were severaly different types of meat left (some porc, sausages and a beef steak) and because my MIL and I were the only one who doesn\u2019t have already some food, I asked her, if she wanted the beef steak. She said no and so I took it. My BF was on the place beside me and really had the audacity to claim (**with a full mouth!**) that the beef steak was his. I really couldn\u2019t belive he said that because HE IS JUST EATING. So I told him no and that he had enough time to chose witch type of meat he wanted since he sat bevor me and continued to cut the steak. Nobody else said anything but there was a tension after that. It\u2019s not that I have a problem with sharing food. I would if he had asked me to split the steak, but he insisted to get the whole steak.\n\nAs we were finished my MIL and I were in the kitchen, cleaning it and I couldn\u2019t help myself and complained to her about her son and his behavior. And then she just looked at me and said \u201eYou know.. The beef is for the boys.\u201c And continued to clean the kitchen. I was dumbfounded and didn\u2019t said anything after that, but this evening is stuck in my head.

I would run away from this situation. Your bf was raised in a way that is not going to be compatible with you long-term", "NTA. What a misogynistic, backwards family.

The whole lot of them.\n\nYou'd probably be better off single.", "NTA.  \n\nThere's no way these are the only red flags.  Look at them all together, not one little thing at a time, and I bet you'll see a pattern.  Get out while you can.", "So she has a lot of internal sexism that she more than likely won't deal with. You see what your future is with your boyfriend and if you stay in that family you are going to be the one in the kitchen. Also they aren't your in laws if you aren't married yet so why add this extra layer to it?", "NTA, just bc he was raised that way doesn't mean he can't man up now and stop acting like a little boy. You should emphasize you expect him to help when you guys go over or personally I'd stop going. I'm not going to play into the women do the chores. So old school machismo. That's a major red flag honestly. Be weary of your future with this man.", "NTA.  You have an inconsiderate bf and a possible family dynamic that you may want to question whether or not you want to deal with.  Personally, I'd leave that relationship behind.  Wouldn't want to deal with the drama that will eventually follow.", "NTA\n\nBF is selfish, boys in the family are childish and probably misogynist. You had every right to eat that steak.", "NTA You had me at steak...Beef is not just for the boys it's for everyone", "NTA - But the MIL and the way her boys were raised, should raise some RED FLAGS for you.  You may want to limit how many times you accept their invitations, because your BF is being retrained \"in how a man and wife SHOULD act\".", "Definitely NTA. A man treating his mother like that is not worth your time and energy. If even the _barest_ of minimums is too much to ask, he can fuck right off.", "NTA\n\nHuge huge red flag, and you need to dump the AH boyfriend immediately. \n\nTo me that would a n instant relationship ender, and if you let him get away this, expect more misogyny from him and his family.", "NTA. It\u2019s super strange that they have a rule that steak is only for men? Do you know other families like this that make the women do all the work? \n\nI would definitely approach this relationship with caution. Family dynamics can really affect a relationship, especially if you\u2019re going over to their house a lot. Also, keep in mind that your boyfriend learned how to treat women from his family. Even if he\u2019s learned better behavior over the years, you never know if/when subconscious misogyny might come out.

But he has made it very clear that hhe thinks this sexist rubbishis totally fine, and his reaction to you taking food that was available was to try to take it off you, which is worrying on so very many levels ... get out while you can.", "NTA. In many third world countries, women and girls don't get to eat till the men and boys have had their fill. This is not quite so bad, as there was food for everybody, but it is completely unreasonable to claim that only men can have beef.

NTA.  You don't want to be part of that family.", "OP, take this as a sign, you will be treated like a second class citizen for your entire life with this man.

Get out before they try and force you into this same paradigm.", "Can you see the bigger picture? What do you think will happen if you get married and have a baby girl?

Everyone else for obvious reasons, but:\n\nI think your boyfriend is entitled (shocker, given his upbringing), but this is not how you behave in someone else\u2019s home. \n\nIf you do not want to help clean up, then don\u2019t. But you cannot walk into someone else\u2019s house and criticise the way they run their household. You have a lot of judgement, probably rightly, but this woman raised the man you love. You have some say over how he behaves in your home, but you do not have a say in how she treats him in hers. \n\nOn top of that, you made things very awkward for everyone just to prove your point. This is a \u2018go home and discuss\u2019 situation, not drag everyone into it there. You could have calmly said, \u2018oh right, I didn\u2019t realise you wanted it as you\u2019re already eating and you\u2019ve served yourself, shall we split it?\u2019 You chose to make your point publicly and by doing so you have cast judgement on his family instead of discussing it with your partner. \n\nFinally, you\u2019ve gone complaining to his mother - what?? Why would you do this before talking to him yourself?\n\nPoor handling of the scenario all round.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
