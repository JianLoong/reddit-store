And that was hilarious :D", "NTA\n\nI can see why you\u2019re worried about leaning in to the misogynistic culture, and that\u2019s definitely a dilemma - but it\u2019s not black and white and sometimes you have to blend in to the culture around you to survive. So I\u2019m gonna say you\u2019re not the asshole for that, but if you want to you could always think up some go-tos for the future, that avoid that kind of grey area.\n\n(From myself and my Gal Pal - who laughed our asses off. We love your work.)", "I detest misogynistic jokes too, but if that's what it takes to get them to shut up....eh the world can handle a joke or two.

I tried hard to think if (just for yourself) there was you knew wasn't right. \n\n1. The \"your mom\" joke came off as nothing more than that. Crude, but clearly fitting the setting and clearly a standard 'your mom' joke.\n2. The biggest flag was that you felt icky. I think it's because you used the derogatory terms for a lesbian. I don't think you were an ahole for embarrassing the guy. But if you don't feel right using those words, even in that situation, then maybe think through a response that has the same effect but doesn't leave you feeling icky.", "This is class! NTA", "NTA. You're queen shit, is what you are. Amazing. Sure, the joke is misogynist, but given where you are and who you're dealing with, you can't bring a knife to a gun fight.

Don't sweat it.\n\nAlso, \"I'll call him Robert because that's his name\" had me WHEEZING XD", "NTA -- sounds like he had it coming with his bigoted malarkey.  That being said, if it feels \"icky\" to you -- then that's your best gauge and you may want to tone done some going forward -- not because it was a bad thing to do, but because it's probably not worth your feeling \"icky\" about it.\n\n\"How's any of that any of your, or anyone else's business?\" might be an easier way to go.

If anything be proud of yourself for turning it around and having a little fun with it. There needs to be more of this, it's the only way to stop ignorant people like Robert!", "Taking it too far would be throwing him off the roof like they do to us homos in some places.
