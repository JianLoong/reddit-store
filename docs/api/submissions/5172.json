Secondly it\u2019s quite hard for me not to be accidentally rude because I say stupid stuff a lot (example: calling Stich my favorite Pixar character) and sometimes will say something that I think means one thing and will mean something else to other people so even if I try I\u2019ll still say something rude.", "There is one more.

I think the real question you have is if you weren't an a****** why does it feel bad? A thing I've learned about people in my short time on this planet is that those of us with empathy, which most have at least a little, have a hard time making others feel bad.  When you hurt/mock/insult someone, even if you have every reason to, you feel some of the pain you've caused.
