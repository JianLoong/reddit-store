Without getting called a fucking lesbian nowadays.\"\n\nAt that point most of my coworkers cracked up, and Robert was catching on that it was an elaborate setup for a \"your mom\" joke and he got angry  asking if I was mocking him. \n\nI was like \"Fuckin took you long enough! Like seriously, you should of noticed I was fruity years ago, when I kept coming over your mom's house at night.\"\n\nHe stormed off cussing me out and I felt kinda like I had a good laugh but also kinda like I went a little too far.

I mean obviously that would get you in trouble in like a corporate office job, but you know that.  You also know that relying on misogynistic humor is not the super mega coolest thing in the world - but you're just fitting in with a culture that's already there, and if any of the people there were likely to be meaningfully hurt as a result of that kind of humor, *it would most likely be you yourself.*  So as long as that read is right, that that's just the kind of gruff humor your workplace has, I think you're just fine.\n\nEdit: Missed the word \"not\" in a sentence lol", "NTA.

Like it wasn\u2019t anything he could realistically take to HR so I think it\u2019s fine. Plus it was funny. And he was actually being bigoted and straight up rude.
