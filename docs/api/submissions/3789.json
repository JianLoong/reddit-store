The family hung out in the family room/den which was furnished with furniture that was sturdy and might well have seen better days so no one was particularly picky about scuffs or water marks or whatever.", "So, you don't think your daughter will get her mucky finger prints all over and draw on the walls and floors? Oh honey, you're in for a rude awakening.", "Going with yeah, YTA. You chose to live next door to your sister for closeness to family I'm assuming? From the description, she's cleaning up after her toddler and not leaving the mess for you. \n\nYour own child will be making a mess soon enough. Maybe you just want to hold off the chaos, but baby-proof nowand put all your nice stuff in storage. \n\nThe bit about how your parents are staying with you to help with a newborn, but not being able to focus because their other grandchild there doesn't paint you in a very good light. Do you think your baby is being neglected by the two or three adults present because of one other child? Come on...", "YTA your sister cleans up after the toddler. You better learn real soon to loosen up or you're going to be in trouble when your newborn is no longer a newborn. Like you're seriously bitching over fingerprints on the windows THAT YOUR SISTER CLEANED UP?", "YTA\n\nI was with you *right* up until you banned your nephew from coming over even *with* your sister, who chases after him, cleans up after him (even washes his prints off the windows), and seems to work really hard to respect your house.  It's totally fair to not want to come home to a mess everyday from someone else's kid, but that's not an issue when your sister is with him, so it's hard to understand why he should still be banned when she's there with him to supervise.  \n\nAnd this isn't just your house.  It is also your parents' home.  Your sister should be able to visit her parents in their home with her child so long as she is adequately supervising him and cleaning up his messes.  Which it sounds like she is going the extra mile to do.", "YTA\n\nYour nephew is a toddler.  Your child will be one soon.  You're going to have to learn to deal with little fingerprints and messes as the children grow.\n\nConsider this practice for your child in two years, and learn how to deal with it in a reasonable way.  Chasing after a toddler 24/7 to wipe things down and avoid fingerprints isn't going to work. One wipe-down at the end of the day should be sufficient.\n\nETA - your rule is also cruel in that it isolates both your parents and your sister from adult company during the day, and prevents them from helping each other.  If, say, your parents have to go to an appointment, your sister should be able to help.  And vice-versa.  And even just being able to have coffee together in the afternoon is a nice break that helps make the task of childcare less isolating and more sane. \n\nYour parents are doing you a massive favor, helping care for your kid.  Don't try to make isolating them a condition of providing that help.  You know your sister can't get a sitter during the day to watch her child, just to visit your parents.", "INFO: Do you plan on banning your daighter from your house once she start doing the same toddler sutff?", "YTA.

Millions of parents across the globe have more than one child. \n2) Your own child will be doing these things very soon. You might as well start to accept that toddlers are messy\n3) You definitely are putting your material things ahead of relationships. Your mother can barely see her grandson who lives next door.", "Hmm. This is tough. On one hand it's your property so you should decide who is on it and what they do. On the other hand it sounds like your sister does clean up after him so you aren't having to deal with regardless. In that sense you are quite literally putting the idea of someone making a mess over your actual family member even though said mess Isn't actually affecting you. For that I think YTA unless he has done permanent damage. Also not sure why grandparents can't just hang out at her house and not bother with yours.", "> I told my mom she can\u2019t focus on my daughter and her grandson at the same time. \n\nYTA for this sentence alone.

Currently, you are picking your home over your nephew. It's a house. It's a material object. Is it worth damaging your relationship with your family?\nNo material objects should be valued more than a few fingerprints.

My neiblings were not messy hyperactive kids by any measure, and broken windows and clogged toilets were the norm.", "YTA. Grandparents certainly can watch two children at once (after all, they raised you and your sister.) Toddlers leave fingerprints. Get used to it, because your kid will, too.

YTA. It's a kid. Your sister watches him and cleans up after,  what more do your want? Do you really think your house will always be pristine with a kid in it? If it does, then your kid will be miserable because he can't play in his own house.", "YTA and I actually laughed because you have no idea what\u2019s coming your way when your child becomes a toddler. I hate saying that because parents who say \u201cjust wait for this stage, it\u2019s awful\u201d\ndrive me nuts, but you seem to be under the false impression that your kid isn\u2019t going to be doing the exact same shit when she\u2019s your nephew\u2019s age. Your sister seems to be a great parent by your own description of what\u2019s going on. She immediately cleans up any mess, and redirects her toddler when he\u2019s struggling. I\u2019d say you could learn a thing or two. Also, I hate to break it to, but your daughter isn\u2019t going to be the center of everyone\u2019s universe like she is yours. People have multiple kids all of the time, and make it work. It seems like the issue here is you not wanting to share your mom/babysitter with someone else because it doesn\u2019t benefit you.", "YTA - they make things like playpens for kids if you want to coral them to a particular area of your home.

A toddler! What expectations do you have of him? You have a newborn\u2026 wait and year and you\u2019ll get it. Hopefully your sister will ban her from her house for acting like a normal child of that age to give you a taste of your own medication.", "Soft YTA here. It's your house so you have every right to not have people over; however, let's talk about what's wrong with this attitude. Firstly, your sister does not leave the messes, you acknowledge she cleans them up immediately. Secondly, you're saying that your mom (who I'm assuming is your babysitter) *can't* focus on both of her grandchildren at once? Do you think people can't hold friendships (or even parent child relationships) with multiple people and manage to give them the same attention?", "YTA - Hope you manage to develop some compassion before your own child is toddler age.", "YTA.", "INFO: Does he only get things dirty?

Sorry.  I think some perspective would help. If your concern is that a mess will be made and it will be cleaned up and you won\u2019t notice and than no real harm as come to pass. \n\nI\u2019m not going to call you names or anything but I think you made a mistake. Your sister is being a good mother and cleaning up his messes so you should be proud. Over time your sister will work on his control as he gets enough.

What are you gonna do to your kid reaching the same age? Also ban her from house?!", "YTA. You flat out said your sister is dealing with his messes immediately.

You\u2019re going to have a dirty house from YOUR toddler before long. What does it cost you to start a little earlier so that your parents can enjoy both their grandchildren?", "If your sister was inconsiderate and left her son's messes for you to deal with, I'd think your reaction was reasonable. But she busts her butt to clean up after every little mess he makes when they're at your place, which is incredibly considerate and attentive. I hope you're just as thoughtful when your kid's that age and making a mess at her place. YTA.", "INFO ot sounds like your sister is right on top of her son, what's the difference which home they visit at?", "YTA - Sounds like your nephew is just doing what toddlers do. I suggest you get used to it because you will be dealing with your own child doing the same soon enough. Based on the whole people coming and going style described in your story, it seems a bit much to ban him. HOWEVER, your sister should be offering to clean up after him. It seems the rule would be better modified to explaining where the cleaning supplies are. I would never leave a mess my child made at someone else's house.\n\nEdit: Missed the part where you say your sister does clean up after him. I am missing the issue in the end then and how being there will make anything better or worse? As long as the mess is cleaned, what's the issue?", "YTA - man, the house will be cleaned. That precious time spend with family won't be as abundant for the kid if you just straight up ban him if you're not there. And having her come over without her son when she visits? what kind of shit is that lol", "Sorry but YTA. I don\u2019t get your reasoning on this. Your nephew is a toddler and behaving like child his age. His mother is keeping eye on him and cleaning up after if anything happens \n\nWhat is so important/wrong about windows with hand prints, it is a non issue in wider scheme if things. As your daughter get older you will be dealing with and more. As toddler young kids will struggle and how will like it, if someone put this in place for you? Betting there is a good chance about being upset and feeling like excluded for no real reason.\n\nIf you really have a issues about your nephew, them maybe a play area for them and given you have a baby, this going to be needed when they get older.\n\nYeah, having two children in one go isn\u2019t easy, but with your parents and sister, so that\u2019s 3:2 ratio is manageable. From what your saying they only stay 20-30mins which makes it a non issues for me.\n\nFinally, unintentional you are control how and when  your parents they see your sister/nephew. They are there to help care for your child, so what opportunities will they have to see their daughter and grandson. Having to wait until you come home. This is not treating people with respect and empathy.", "YTA", "YTA. Wow. W o w.", "Info - what reasoning do you have for thinking that your mom \"can't focus on my daughter and her grandson at the same time\"?  Have there been any type of incidents that resulted in negligent care for your daughter because your nephew was there?", "NAH. It's your house and you can set the rules if you want. But keep in mind that your parents live there now too and you are being controlling of who can visit them in \"their\" home too. \n\nIt sounds like your sister has been incredibly responsible with cleaning up after your nephew when you're there.

Will you be ok with that?", "Just trust me, play it cool for now because if you don\u2019t you will have the entire family mocking you mercilessly when your kid is a toddler and acts like one.

As soon as others can't accept your values over theirs (and vice versa) you're sitting on an ticking bomb with it.

As soon as another guest or you yourself accidentally damages smth you will get some remarks like \"you/ them should be banished from your home too\".\nI think you and your family should really work (hard) on a compromise that secures your whishes and doesn't make the rest feel like their a nuisance to you!\nSo mildly Y-T-A for now, because you brought this rule onto your parents without letting your sister know.

The solution: talk with eachother!", "Eh soft no AH here. It's your house you can have who you want there.

In the time it took my sister to pull off the baby's coat and put her in the playpen, the 3 year old had ran into the bathroom and removed the lid to the toilet. Bathroom was right next to the room my sister left, so when she stepped out of one room, she was right there in the doorway of the bathroom. My 3 year old niece got startled and dropped the lid on the pipe and it was under the shut off valve. Water went everywhere and they couldn't shut it off. Had to wait 15 minutes for the city to come turn off the water. Everything flooded. Once the water was off, the floor to the second story/ceiling to the kitchen came crashing down.

As soon as the kids got old enough to color a mat was found where all coloring can be done - that doesn't mean one of the kids hasn't colored on their toys or their rocking chair in my home because it happens. My niece loves stickers and leaves them everywhere but nobody is stupid enough to get her stickers that can't be easily removed - the things have so little adhesive they fall off of on their own in maybe less than an hour. \n\nThings happen and life is waayyyy too short to be worrying about fingerprints on glass or crayon on the floor, both which OP's sister cleaned - good cleaning supplies are a blessing. But hey, they'll find out when their kid uses the bathroom in a corner (this hasn't happened in my house but it has in my siblings') without a diaper on because they ran off before one could be put on after a bath or  when the kid colors on their things. Honestly, to me it sounds like OP needs to invest a small amount of money on something like a mat, maybe some small amount of baby-proofing. They'll need it all soon enough anyway because those kids grow like weeds. They're an infant and you turn around and suddenly they're threenagers (the terrible 2s are a joke.

You will never be able to manage the stress of a toddler if you are that uptight about very minor messes.", "YTA just wait till your child is moving!!!", "YTA...I cant wait for your baby to reach your nephews age...you will feel shame for ever being so foolish.", "YTA oh I hope your baby hits the terrible twos with a bang and you will know how short sighted you have been her e", "OP\u2019s kid is gonna be banned when it hits that age too", "I mean you and your sister both seem to be alive\u2026 so obviously she can take care of two kids at once\u2026.", "Agreed, that\u2019s how I read it too.", "I\u2019m so sorry you went through that and are still dealing with it.  It makes me sad when people prioritize stuff over people, and that feels like the case here. \nIt\u2019s one thing if her sister did nothing about it, and didn\u2019t care. But she chases after her son and cleans up, so I just don\u2019t understand.", "So you're willing to ruin your relationship with your sister (which I assume is a good one, since you moved next to each other) over some crumbs, fingerprints and the occasional scribbles, all of which your sister immediately cleans up? You should think it over.\n\nAnd maybe get some kind of therapy, because soon enough your own kid will be doing the same things and you should learn to cope.", "You\u2019re taking outrageous advantage of your parents. It\u2019s disgusting that they\u2019re working over 12 hours a day and being told they can\u2019t see their other grandchild. If your parents are living with you, it\u2019s their home too and should be allowed to have visits from their daughter and grandchild.", "Fwiw hand sanitizer, rubbing alcohol, hairspray or similar liquids will take permanent marker off just about anything. Microfiber or Scrubmommy helps. Folex or magic eraser if the others don\u2019t work. Hardwood, painted drywall, tile, various cabinets, TV screens, etc have all been cleaned in our house with those products. Both of our kids are graffiti artists.", "Don't underestimate how a parent can restrict a toddler to keep the house clean.", "The very first time the newborn projectile vomits, they'll be begging the sister for tips on how to clean up", "That was in response to saying her kid will also do toddler things. The idea is that her tolerance may be higher for her own kid than for her sister's. It's not only about who cleans, but also about the fact that the kid messes daily woh their house.", "You\u2019re delusional", ">I think it will be different with my own kid\n\nHow? What\u2019s the difference?", "Tell me you don't have kids without telling me you don't have kids. Lol. Toddlers are not rational beings and you can only do so much. You can educate them, talk to them, explain things to them and they will understand and they will listen. Then they get excited and it all goes flying and they take a vase and smash it on the floor or they take your partners dildo and stick on top of the table as the family is having a meal. Or they paibt the floors. You know, toddler stuff. Sometimes they can't help themselves and in some cases they do stuff like this all the time. And there is very little you can do about it. They are nit rational.", "This is where OP loses me as well. Nowhere does it say that grandma is expected to supervise the nephew so I\u2019m confused.", "My grandad blew his school roof with gundpowder when he was 3. They don't always manage.", "Every child has different personalities. While you were content sitting in one spot quietly, others are more energetic and curious about everything around them.", "YTA for saying that. You have no idea. There are toddlers who do stuff like this despite their parents. Until you go through it yourself, you have no idea.", "Ok I have 3 kids, 2 as a toddler would sit and play quietly, the third is like a whirlwind of mischief. I cannot take my eyes off him. Of course he's taught the same rules as everyone else, but if I take my eyes off him for a second he's into something. Like OPs sister I'm straight in dealing with whatever it is he's done, but I do not for one second see that as a parenting problem. She complains about finger prints on windows and doors, but come on, he's a little kid. Fingerprints come with the territory!", "They are literally magic\u2026. Getting my son ready for a bath, I open the bathroom door, get his clothes off, move *right next* to the bathroom to grab his little buzz lightyear towel, close the linen closet pivot towards the bathroom and here is my son sitting on the floor in his diaper covered in my purple body wash that I thought was out his reach on the sink/vanity, maybe a total of 10 seconds\u2026. It was every where he was saturated with it, sitting in a nice lovely pile of the brand new body wash I just got the day before. It was a very fragrant soapy bath lol", "Lucky my nephew isn\u2019t quite there yet, he turned 1 at the end of October but he\u2019s always on the move. His new thing now apparently is trying to eat dog food which of course freaks out his mom, he\u2019ll cry when they take it away. They\u2019ve been pretty lucky, he sleeps like a champ and is generally just a happy baby.", "And if they are quiet you know something is going down, it\u2019s the sound of doom", "That beats my dildo on the table at christmas story by a mile. Daaaaaamn...", "Same with one of my niblings. Of course, they found the next one was the complete opposite - a climber and then a runner :D", "Yes!"]}
