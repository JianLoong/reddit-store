The family hung out in the family room/den which was furnished with furniture that was sturdy and might well have seen better days so no one was particularly picky about scuffs or water marks or whatever.", "So, you don't think your daughter will get her mucky finger prints all over and draw on the walls and floors? Oh honey, you're in for a rude awakening.", "Going with yeah, YTA. You chose to live next door to your sister for closeness to family I'm assuming? From the description, she's cleaning up after her toddler and not leaving the mess for you. \n\nYour own child will be making a mess soon enough. Maybe you just want to hold off the chaos, but baby-proof nowand put all your nice stuff in storage. \n\nThe bit about how your parents are staying with you to help with a newborn, but not being able to focus because their other grandchild there doesn't paint you in a very good light. Do you think your baby is being neglected by the two or three adults present because of one other child? Come on...", "YTA your sister cleans up after the toddler. You better learn real soon to loosen up or you're going to be in trouble when your newborn is no longer a newborn. Like you're seriously bitching over fingerprints on the windows THAT YOUR SISTER CLEANED UP?", "YTA\n\nI was with you *right* up until you banned your nephew from coming over even *with* your sister, who chases after him, cleans up after him (even washes his prints off the windows), and seems to work really hard to respect your house.  It's totally fair to not want to come home to a mess everyday from someone else's kid, but that's not an issue when your sister is with him, so it's hard to understand why he should still be banned when she's there with him to supervise.  \n\nAnd this isn't just your house.  It is also your parents' home.  Your sister should be able to visit her parents in their home with her child so long as she is adequately supervising him and cleaning up his messes.  Which it sounds like she is going the extra mile to do.", "YTA\n\nYour nephew is a toddler.  Your child will be one soon.  You're going to have to learn to deal with little fingerprints and messes as the children grow.\n\nConsider this practice for your child in two years, and learn how to deal with it in a reasonable way.  Chasing after a toddler 24/7 to wipe things down and avoid fingerprints isn't going to work. One wipe-down at the end of the day should be sufficient.\n\nETA - your rule is also cruel in that it isolates both your parents and your sister from adult company during the day, and prevents them from helping each other.  If, say, your parents have to go to an appointment, your sister should be able to help.  And vice-versa.  And even just being able to have coffee together in the afternoon is a nice break that helps make the task of childcare less isolating and more sane. \n\nYour parents are doing you a massive favor, helping care for your kid.  Don't try to make isolating them a condition of providing that help.  You know your sister can't get a sitter during the day to watch her child, just to visit your parents.", "INFO: Do you plan on banning your daighter from your house once she start doing the same toddler sutff?", "YTA.

Millions of parents across the globe have more than one child. \n2) Your own child will be doing these things very soon. You might as well start to accept that toddlers are messy\n3) You definitely are putting your material things ahead of relationships. Your mother can barely see her grandson who lives next door.", "Hmm. This is tough. On one hand it's your property so you should decide who is on it and what they do. On the other hand it sounds like your sister does clean up after him so you aren't having to deal with regardless. In that sense you are quite literally putting the idea of someone making a mess over your actual family member even though said mess Isn't actually affecting you. For that I think YTA unless he has done permanent damage. Also not sure why grandparents can't just hang out at her house and not bother with yours.", "> I told my mom she can\u2019t focus on my daughter and her grandson at the same time. \n\nYTA for this sentence alone.

Currently, you are picking your home over your nephew. It's a house. It's a material object. Is it worth damaging your relationship with your family?\nNo material objects should be valued more than a few fingerprints.

My neiblings were not messy hyperactive kids by any measure, and broken windows and clogged toilets were the norm.", "YTA. Grandparents certainly can watch two children at once (after all, they raised you and your sister.) Toddlers leave fingerprints. Get used to it, because your kid will, too.

YTA. It's a kid. Your sister watches him and cleans up after,  what more do your want? Do you really think your house will always be pristine with a kid in it? If it does, then your kid will be miserable because he can't play in his own house.", "YTA and I actually laughed because you have no idea what\u2019s coming your way when your child becomes a toddler. I hate saying that because parents who say \u201cjust wait for this stage, it\u2019s awful\u201d\ndrive me nuts, but you seem to be under the false impression that your kid isn\u2019t going to be doing the exact same shit when she\u2019s your nephew\u2019s age. Your sister seems to be a great parent by your own description of what\u2019s going on. She immediately cleans up any mess, and redirects her toddler when he\u2019s struggling. I\u2019d say you could learn a thing or two. Also, I hate to break it to, but your daughter isn\u2019t going to be the center of everyone\u2019s universe like she is yours. People have multiple kids all of the time, and make it work. It seems like the issue here is you not wanting to share your mom/babysitter with someone else because it doesn\u2019t benefit you.", "YTA - they make things like playpens for kids if you want to coral them to a particular area of your home.

A toddler! What expectations do you have of him? You have a newborn\u2026 wait and year and you\u2019ll get it. Hopefully your sister will ban her from her house for acting like a normal child of that age to give you a taste of your own medication.", "Soft YTA here. It's your house so you have every right to not have people over; however, let's talk about what's wrong with this attitude. Firstly, your sister does not leave the messes, you acknowledge she cleans them up immediately. Secondly, you're saying that your mom (who I'm assuming is your babysitter) *can't* focus on both of her grandchildren at once? Do you think people can't hold friendships (or even parent child relationships) with multiple people and manage to give them the same attention?", "YTA - Hope you manage to develop some compassion before your own child is toddler age.", "YTA.", "INFO: Does he only get things dirty?

Sorry.  I think some perspective would help. If your concern is that a mess will be made and it will be cleaned up and you won\u2019t notice and than no real harm as come to pass. \n\nI\u2019m not going to call you names or anything but I think you made a mistake. Your sister is being a good mother and cleaning up his messes so you should be proud. Over time your sister will work on his control as he gets enough.

What are you gonna do to your kid reaching the same age? Also ban her from house?!", "YTA. You flat out said your sister is dealing with his messes immediately.

You\u2019re going to have a dirty house from YOUR toddler before long. What does it cost you to start a little earlier so that your parents can enjoy both their grandchildren?", "If your sister was inconsiderate and left her son's messes for you to deal with, I'd think your reaction was reasonable. But she busts her butt to clean up after every little mess he makes when they're at your place, which is incredibly considerate and attentive. I hope you're just as thoughtful when your kid's that age and making a mess at her place. YTA.", "INFO ot sounds like your sister is right on top of her son, what's the difference which home they visit at?", "YTA - Sounds like your nephew is just doing what toddlers do. I suggest you get used to it because you will be dealing with your own child doing the same soon enough. Based on the whole people coming and going style described in your story, it seems a bit much to ban him. HOWEVER, your sister should be offering to clean up after him. It seems the rule would be better modified to explaining where the cleaning supplies are. I would never leave a mess my child made at someone else's house.\n\nEdit: Missed the part where you say your sister does clean up after him. I am missing the issue in the end then and how being there will make anything better or worse? As long as the mess is cleaned, what's the issue?", "YTA - man, the house will be cleaned. That precious time spend with family won't be as abundant for the kid if you just straight up ban him if you're not there. And having her come over without her son when she visits? what kind of shit is that lol", "Sorry but YTA. I don\u2019t get your reasoning on this. Your nephew is a toddler and behaving like child his age. His mother is keeping eye on him and cleaning up after if anything happens \n\nWhat is so important/wrong about windows with hand prints, it is a non issue in wider scheme if things. As your daughter get older you will be dealing with and more. As toddler young kids will struggle and how will like it, if someone put this in place for you? Betting there is a good chance about being upset and feeling like excluded for no real reason.\n\nIf you really have a issues about your nephew, them maybe a play area for them and given you have a baby, this going to be needed when they get older.\n\nYeah, having two children in one go isn\u2019t easy, but with your parents and sister, so that\u2019s 3:2 ratio is manageable. From what your saying they only stay 20-30mins which makes it a non issues for me.\n\nFinally, unintentional you are control how and when  your parents they see your sister/nephew. They are there to help care for your child, so what opportunities will they have to see their daughter and grandson. Having to wait until you come home. This is not treating people with respect and empathy.", "YTA", "YTA. Wow. W o w.", "Info - what reasoning do you have for thinking that your mom \"can't focus on my daughter and her grandson at the same time\"?  Have there been any type of incidents that resulted in negligent care for your daughter because your nephew was there?", "NAH. It's your house and you can set the rules if you want. But keep in mind that your parents live there now too and you are being controlling of who can visit them in \"their\" home too. \n\nIt sounds like your sister has been incredibly responsible with cleaning up after your nephew when you're there.

Will you be ok with that?", "Just trust me, play it cool for now because if you don\u2019t you will have the entire family mocking you mercilessly when your kid is a toddler and acts like one.

As soon as others can't accept your values over theirs (and vice versa) you're sitting on an ticking bomb with it.

As soon as another guest or you yourself accidentally damages smth you will get some remarks like \"you/ them should be banished from your home too\".\nI think you and your family should really work (hard) on a compromise that secures your whishes and doesn't make the rest feel like their a nuisance to you!\nSo mildly Y-T-A for now, because you brought this rule onto your parents without letting your sister know.

The solution: talk with eachother!", "Eh soft no AH here. It's your house you can have who you want there.

Soon her kid will leave, God forbid, fingerprints on the sliding glass door.", "no no, they have one of the magic no mess ones", "But she'll most likely tolerate cleaning after her own kid's messes more than after another's. Especially if there will be messes that can't be cleaned perfectly.", "YTA, you\u2019re horribly taking advantage of your parents and treating them like slaves. I hope they move in with with your sister and ban you from her house and their life.", "Your parents deserve a break then. You need to find other childcare arrangements since you\u2019re too bossy with your ridiculous rules. When your nephew makes a mess, it gets immediately cleaned up. Lighten up. I hope your parents move out. YTA", "My mil hired a caretaker for her parents that was 3k plus room and board.  I highly doubt they live in an area where they would have to pay someone else this much for rent.  I'd personally never give up my life to watch my sons kids for a measly 1k a month and being an indentured servant.", " But she said her sister is always with the child.  They pop over to say hi.  The sister isn't dumping the kid on grandma and taking time to herself.", "She seems responsible in a reactionary way, but not in a preventative way.", "\u201cit will be different with my own kid\u201d\nFamous last words\u2026 Good luck with that, haha", ">I think it will be different with my own kid.\n\nThat's adorable that you think that. You're gonna be running around cleaning up messes exactly like your sister is now lol.", "So YTA and delusional. From a single father of two, you have a lot to learn about kids. Your nephew is a kid and you're already like this, I can't imagine how you will be when your own toddler makes a mess. You might want to speak to a therapist because I'm wondering if their is an anxiety or a control issue based on your post and comments.\n\nEdit - I just saw how long you AND your husband are gone. You expect your parents to be caregivers over 12 hours a day and think you can dictate how they see their other grandchildren?!? Yeah you are a world class AH.", "Everyone thinks their kid is different/special/not like other \u201cbadly behaved\u201d kids. I promise you\u2019re going to eat those words in a year or two", "It sounds like your sister needs to move away from you.", "Agreed, I hadn\u2019t read any of OPs comments before I said that. Basically gave up their retirement to raise OPs kid AND feed THEM dinner every night. \n\nHow someone could do that to their parents is beyond me, I thought it was a more relaxed thing.", "I think they kind of are. I know I wouldn't be able to do it.", "Permanent marker can't be cleaned easily, espically if it's been used on upholstery and carpet.", "He's going to be in for a world of hurt when he realises his baby is going to be a toddler soon."]}
