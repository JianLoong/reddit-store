This is not my grandma, she will be his second wife. She is pretty nice, but my grandma died not even 1.5 years ago and my grandpa is a rich asshole. Hope that sort of explained it. \n\nSo when my dad told me I would have to find somebody to cover my shift I told him I didn\u2019t want to miss work. He then said I would have to and I told him not unless he would make up for the money I\u2019m missing out on. I don\u2019t not want to go but I\u2019d honestly rather not miss work and I also need the money.
