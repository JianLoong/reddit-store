A little backstory Growing up I was always close to my cousin let\u2019s call him Ryan (20m) Ryan grew up normal and got in an accident when he was 17 making him paralysed from the waist down.\n\nI came out as gay when I was 19 and recently got a boyfriend to which Ryan think he has more rights and the \u201cone up\u201d since he\u2019s in a wheelchair which I\u2019m not gonna get too much into, he has been openly homophobic, he claims being gay is not natural, disgusting, gay people are disabled and is a sin (he isn\u2019t even religious) when I came out to him a couple years ago he outright cut me out of his life even though I was there for him through his whole recovery of his accident, we haven\u2019t spoken in about a year.\nThis year I turned 21 and made a little event on Facebook, I invited my family and friends including ryan. About a week or so before my birthday my family was at my house as it was my moms birthday, ryan saw that I had a boyfriend and kept giving us dirty looks. Ryan eventually wheeled over to us and said \u201coh so you\u2019re still a f(slur), you both will burn in hell\u201d. Everyone at my house heard and it went silent, me and my partner were speechless so we just ignored it as we thought it was best not to retaliate and didn\u2019t want to make a scene at my moms birthday.\nLater I went on Facebook, removed him from the event and blocked him on all social media. My phone started blowing up with texts from my uncle and Aunty saying how inconsiderate I was to do such a thing and that me and my boyfriend need to stop being so \u201csoft\u201d and that gay people are always so soft, I tried to ignore the messages but they kept messaging to which I replied \u201cit\u2019s my birthday I can invited and uninvite whoever I want, he called me a slur and has never accepted me, maybe he should look in the mirror and see that HE is the disabled one here, not me and at least I can walk away from family unlike him\u201d and then blocked their numbers, my parents found out what I said and claimed what I said was \u201cuncalled for\u201d and \u201cout of pocket\u201d and saying that I need to apologise, I don\u2019t think I need to apologise for anything I done, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve done anything wrong, my boyfriend said I may have been a bit harsh on my words which has me thinking if I\u2019m an asshole or not.

However, since you\u2019re asking about the initial decision in your title, that\u2019s what I\u2018m judging. NTA for revoking an invitation to a homophobe who openly insulted you. His wheelchair doesn\u2019t even play into this part of the conflict.", "NTA\n\nToxic people create toxic environments.  You two grow together and let Ryan do his thing.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t disinvite him because he\u2019s disabled. You disinvited him because he\u2019s a bigoted asshole who treats you poorly. And his parents are idiots too.

What they failed to realize or maybe ignored is the fact that your cousin describes being gay as a disability. You are setting the record straight (pun not intended). You're not the one with a disability, because being gay is not a disability, he is.

The wheelchair doesn't remove manners, nor does it remove the obligation of using them. He said horrible things to you, therefore he doesn't get a invite.

If you want to have a relationship with your aunt and uncle moving forward, I\u2019d suggest maybe typing up\u2026 an apology?

The fact that your cousin has been openly homophobic to you even when you\u2019re boyfriend was with you just goes to show how little respect he has for you.
