They got married when I was 9 which was 2 years after my mom died. My stepmom is divorced with a 14 year old daughter and a 12 year old son. They have an almost equal amount of time with both their mom and their dad. I say almost equal because my stepmom gets every Christmas, Easter and she gets them every Sunday morning for church because she's religious and he's not.\n\nOne of the pain's about Christmas for me is that I don't get to see my maternal family until after my stepsiblings go back to their dad's on the 27th every year. This is because my dad and stepmom feel as though we should all be together for the holiday's and the \"nuclear family\" is more important than extended family. I also think they don't like knowing I'm having fun and getting gifts from my family and they won't include my stepsiblings.\n\nThis year one of my uncle's was home for Christmas for the first time in several years. He lives in Ireland. So they were trying to get as much time in with him as possible and I wanted to see him for Christmas Eve. I asked my dad who told me my stepsiblings would be here Christmas Eve, so no. My stepmom heard me ask and she told me I should be more concerned with time with my siblings. I argued that I don't get to see my uncle enough. My dad said his decision was final.\n\nI ended up texting with my uncle a lot on Christmas Eve and with my whole family yesterday. My stepmom complained about it a dozen or more times. Of course that was only after my stepsister complained that I never text her when she's with her dad.\n\nMy dad and stepmom approached me before bed and told me I threw away almost two whole days with my family and especially with my siblings. They told me I should have been glad to see them for Christmas and a lot of siblings in blended families are separated for Christmas. And I spent the whole day pining for extended family. I asked them why I would want to see my stepsiblings at Christmas more than my maternal family. They told me nuclear family comes first and siblings are more important than extended. I told them my family, my maternal family, are more important to me and I would choose them every time.\n\nThey yelled at me until I went to bed and I can feel the tension already and I didn't even leave my room yet.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703596955, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r819h/aita_for_asking_my_dad_and_stepmom_why_i_would/", "score": 464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
