We have expressed to all our guests that we wish to have an adults only wedding and asked our guests to make arrangements (please find a babysitter) if they have children. We have several reasons. We have to keep the guest count under 50, or else two of our most expensive vendors both double their prices. Also, small children cause distractions, simply put. We know lots of people allow children at their wedding, and that's ok, we just don't prefer children at ours. Not one of our friends had any opposition to this rule. All of them considered it nice to have a break from their kids for an afternoon and were more than happy to get a babysitter. They all agreed with us that weddings aren't kid-friendly, and it's just less complicated for everyone to find a babysitter.\n\nThe only person giving us a hard time is my sister-in-law. She has what we feel is a very unhealthy relationship with her 3-year-old son. She has coddled him to the point that he screams if she leaves the room. He has to be with his mom every second, or he gets physically sick. She has that baby attached to her hip so badly that she will not allow anyone except family members to watch him, and those family members are all attending my wedding. Her and my brother are trying to guilt trip us into letting them bring my nephew to the wedding. They feel like because they are family, they are a unique circumstance and deserve a pass. We have set a boundary, and we feel like the right thing to do is enforce that boundary. \n\nTo make matters worse, they have got my mother to side with them and call me to plead their case for them. I explained to her last night that if she brings him, she will not be fully present at our wedding. She won't be able to dance with my brother (who is my best man). And if I give in, it will be unfair to all our other guests. I have accepted that my sister-in-law will not be at my wedding, and by refusing to hire a babysitter, that is the choice she is making. I am standing my ground and saying no. It's my wedding, I paid for the whole thing. I set the date, the location, and the flavor of the cake. If I say no kids, I want no kids.

I know it's a family member but the choices our people make shows a lot about them.

But when you say no kids, you have to accept that some people will not be able to attend.  Whatever else is going on with your nephew\u2019s attachment to his mother, none of that is going to magically disappear during a night with a babysitter for your wedding.  So if you hold the line on no kids, it probably means your SIL does not attend the wedding at all (and thus won\u2019t be present at your wedding or dancing with your brother anyway).", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't a summons. I don't think any explanation would satisfy your family. Ask your mother if she'd rather watch her grandson \\*not at the venue\\* or watch your wedding. It's not sarcasm. Him being there is not an option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, given the current drama, are you prepared to hire security to kick your family out if they bring him?", "NTA. She needs to take the decision here on whether being with her child is more important than being at the wedding. And other guests might have made similar sacrifices to attend without kids and will feel put out if there is an exception made for others.", "NTA - It's your wedding, and it's totally fair to have a child-free wedding. \n\nI would say that you dip into the AH territory with your judgy attitude about your SIL's relationship to her child, but it doesn't sound like you've said any of that to *her,* so it's mostly just you being the AH internally.", "NTA. Okay, I get it. SIL is disappointed. And that is understandable. But it's your wedding. It's for you and your intended. Not her and her kid. Furthermore I am convinced that the the reality of weddings is that 9 out of 10 of them have some sort of drama about the guest list. There are only so many people who can attend and there is almost always some guest who thinks you need to squeeze in that just one more that they--the guest--need to be there with them.  \n\nYour wedding. Your guest list. SIL needs to chill.", "Nta for the reasons you stated,  which are perfectly valid!", "NTA\n \nThey can attend via Zoom.", "NTA\n\nYou said\n\nthat he screams if she leaves the room. He has to be with his mom every second, or he gets physically sick\n\nYou are right to stand firm.  It is almost a guarantee that if you make an exception an allow her to bring him,  that  he will scream or do something else to tarnish your ceremony and have focus on him.   Kids who scream when their parent leaves the room will most assuredly scream at anything else that upsets or displeases them.\n\nYou said\nThey have got my mother to side with them and call me to plead their case for them\n\nI tend to think your SIL is spoiled, entitled and accustomed to getting her way. She probably has never had anyone tell her \"No\".

You might need to start looking for a new best man, though\u2026", "NTA OP, pay for *one more thing*. Pay  for a sitter for that one kid. When your SIL shows up with her kid, cause you know she *will*\u2026 she can have the option of\n\neither leaving the kid with the sitter and she can join the festivities\u2026\n\n*or*\n\nshe *and* the kid can go with the baby sitter to the other room far out of earshot of the other celebrants because if/when she throws a tantrum, you don\u2019t wanna hear it and baby sitters are used to dealing with meltdowns thrown by the immature\n\n*or* she and her kid can go home. \n\nHer choice. There are three ways you can do this. Not a fourth way, not the way she wants, because it\u2019s not her party and she isn\u2019t paying for it.", "NTA.  Your request is a simple one that you've set in stone from early on.\n\nHOWEVER - is your fiance backing you up 100%?  It will not bode well with you for the future if he doesn't.  Also, what are your plans when she shows up with your nephew?", "NTA at all.  This sub is full of questions about kid free weddings and there always seems to be someone who thinks they are the exception to the rule.  You made a plan, stick by it.", "NTA for your wedding rules.

Why is that weird?", "INFO:\n\n\"I set the date, the location, and the flavor of the cake.\"\n\nDid your fiancee get a say?", "\"Also, small children cause distractions, simply put.\" I kindly disagree with you, OP. I have been to a couple of weddings. One when I was younger, and one when my stepdad and mom had gotten married. And in both of those weddings, no child caused a distraction. Everybody was having fun. However, I do understand the rule of no children at the wedding. I don't think you are TA at all. Not only what you said is true about it being unfair to other people, but it's also unfair to you. You asked that there would be no children at the wedding, and your sister-in-law is asking to bring the kid regardless. Instead of being that way, she should ask another family member that has kids too if their babysitter could babysit her child too, and if their response is no, she could ask for a recommendation. Now, I do understand her fear of people outside of the family, but not all people are evil. But, in my opinion, you are NTA. You are asking for this special day to be kid-free. That is not such a bad thing to ask for. Your sister-in-law, your brother, and your mother are TA for trying to go against your wishes.", "NTA - true, it's your wedding at the end of the day.\n\nBut it doesn't mean your SIL is an AH either, she's just being a good mother to an anxious 3 year old.

There are kids that age that can do so much and he looses it if mommy is out of the room, that is not normal at all.", "My SIL did the same with her daughter & guess what? She moved with her daughter to be with her when she went to college. SIL's marriage survived, daughter out of college is 26, never worked, never dated & lived with them. My SIL destroyed her daughter's life. It's so sad.", "This child needs to start receiving some specialized services asap. This child has some special needs the parents are not seeing.", "I'm of the mindset that you can do whatever you want at your wedding. You just can't control how people respond. As long as OP is fine with their SIL and possibly brother not attending, then have at it and enjoy the day.", "As long as he\u2019s ok if his brother doesn\u2019t come too.", "> *Some people just think they\u2019re the exception to every rule*\n\nYour mother is going to encourage them to crash, thinking that you won't make a scene once the child is there.  **Hire security to work the door**.\n\nNTA", ">I have accepted that my sister-in-law will not be at my wedding, and by refusing to hire a babysitter, that is the choice she is making. \n\nOP appears to have no problem with accepting SIL's choice. it's SIL that refuses to accept her toddler isn't welcome.", "To be honest, nobody would start a thread here like: \"I had a child free wedding and everybody behaved themselves, AITA?\"", "Idk man.  How else do you describe a kid who literally vomits if his mom is in another room, and the mom acts like that's perfectly normal?", "If neither party is an asshole the ruling is NAH not NTA.", "Dont back down. We did have kids, but only our nephews. 1 was one month old baby but the one which caused the disruption was the 3yr old who SHOUTED his way through our vows. Neither parent removed him.", "OP, I\u2019m also doing a childless wedding BECAUSE of my future niece. I would like my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mother to pay attention to him for ONE night and I know that will be impossible if future niece is there. \n\nAlls that to say, your SIL created your nephews attachment issues and it shouldn\u2019t have to be everyone else\u2019s problem, especially on your wedding day. NTA.", "Why do they both need to stay home? Why can\u2019t she stay home with the kid and he goes to the wedding? I feel like that\u2019s the normal solution.", "Piggy-backing on the comment so OP sees\u2026..\n\nSounds like she\u2019s the sort of person to turn up with the kid anyway - make sure you have a plan to deal with this!", "I was a very clingy, odd ND kid with separation anxiety and I didn't even do that. Even in the realm of \"not normal\" it is not normal. I hope the kid has been taken to the appropriate Dr but I doubt it. Too many parents don't want the truth.", "No, it was Sea Lioning and your response proved that.", "Don\u2019t back down on that though. My kids were planned to be IN a wedding then immediately going to an on site babysitter. A couple of cousins found out and pitched a fit until their kids were allowed to be at the ceremony and on site sitter too. I\u2019m still peeved at them for being so childish about the situation. The bride and groom had already arranged a nearby hotel room with babysitters for a few other families but apparently that wasn\u2019t good enough for them.", "Do they have ASD?", "In my experience parents like this love having control over their kids and wouldn\u2019t be out out that their kid never leaves home.", "Cause she\u2019s not gonna be happy and he\u2019ll most likely choose his wife over his brothers stupid wedding rule (I would). When you make people live by your stupid rules, this what\u2019s happens. These posts are on here all the time, you exclude part of the family and just expect everyone to be ok with it. Then when moms want their kids at a big family event everyone is surprised. You chose to make it not about family by excluding a portion of it. \n\nIf he\u2019s a decent brother he won\u2019t want to cause a rift in his brothers marriage, my guess is he\u2019s not. Childfree marriages are the epitome of selfishness. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear a baby cry\u201d, meanwhile cars are buzzing and honking, wedding staff is wondering whispering, and the photographer is in the brides face, right in the way so nobody can see.\n\nIf you have special rules for your wedding, you shouldn\u2019t expect anyone to go, including family.", "Had to reply to himself too\ud83e\udd26", "Nope, or at least not at a level that would permanently and totally discount him from school or work. He stopped going to public school in 5th grade and had essentially stopped doing any kind of learning by 8th grade.\n\nI knew him as a kid and he was perfectly normal as long as we were visiting. My brother and I would spend time away from our parents at my grandparents (in the same town as my cousins), but his mother wouldn't even let him stay a night 1.5 miles away. His sister, on the other hand, was largely forgotten about by her mom and has a normal life, married with two kids."]}
