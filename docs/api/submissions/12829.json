We have expressed to all our guests that we wish to have an adults only wedding and asked our guests to make arrangements (please find a babysitter) if they have children. We have several reasons. We have to keep the guest count under 50, or else two of our most expensive vendors both double their prices. Also, small children cause distractions, simply put. We know lots of people allow children at their wedding, and that's ok, we just don't prefer children at ours. Not one of our friends had any opposition to this rule. All of them considered it nice to have a break from their kids for an afternoon and were more than happy to get a babysitter. They all agreed with us that weddings aren't kid-friendly, and it's just less complicated for everyone to find a babysitter.\n\nThe only person giving us a hard time is my sister-in-law. She has what we feel is a very unhealthy relationship with her 3-year-old son. She has coddled him to the point that he screams if she leaves the room. He has to be with his mom every second, or he gets physically sick. She has that baby attached to her hip so badly that she will not allow anyone except family members to watch him, and those family members are all attending my wedding. Her and my brother are trying to guilt trip us into letting them bring my nephew to the wedding. They feel like because they are family, they are a unique circumstance and deserve a pass. We have set a boundary, and we feel like the right thing to do is enforce that boundary. \n\nTo make matters worse, they have got my mother to side with them and call me to plead their case for them. I explained to her last night that if she brings him, she will not be fully present at our wedding. She won't be able to dance with my brother (who is my best man). And if I give in, it will be unfair to all our other guests. I have accepted that my sister-in-law will not be at my wedding, and by refusing to hire a babysitter, that is the choice she is making. I am standing my ground and saying no. It's my wedding, I paid for the whole thing. I set the date, the location, and the flavor of the cake. If I say no kids, I want no kids.

I know it's a family member but the choices our people make shows a lot about them.

But when you say no kids, you have to accept that some people will not be able to attend.  Whatever else is going on with your nephew\u2019s attachment to his mother, none of that is going to magically disappear during a night with a babysitter for your wedding.  So if you hold the line on no kids, it probably means your SIL does not attend the wedding at all (and thus won\u2019t be present at your wedding or dancing with your brother anyway).", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't a summons. I don't think any explanation would satisfy your family. Ask your mother if she'd rather watch her grandson \\*not at the venue\\* or watch your wedding. It's not sarcasm. Him being there is not an option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, given the current drama, are you prepared to hire security to kick your family out if they bring him?", "NTA. She needs to take the decision here on whether being with her child is more important than being at the wedding. And other guests might have made similar sacrifices to attend without kids and will feel put out if there is an exception made for others.", "NTA - It's your wedding, and it's totally fair to have a child-free wedding. \n\nI would say that you dip into the AH territory with your judgy attitude about your SIL's relationship to her child, but it doesn't sound like you've said any of that to *her,* so it's mostly just you being the AH internally.", "NTA. Okay, I get it. SIL is disappointed. And that is understandable. But it's your wedding. It's for you and your intended. Not her and her kid. Furthermore I am convinced that the the reality of weddings is that 9 out of 10 of them have some sort of drama about the guest list. There are only so many people who can attend and there is almost always some guest who thinks you need to squeeze in that just one more that they--the guest--need to be there with them.  \n\nYour wedding. Your guest list. SIL needs to chill.", "Nta for the reasons you stated,  which are perfectly valid!", "NTA\n \nThey can attend via Zoom.", "NTA\n\nYou said\n\nthat he screams if she leaves the room. He has to be with his mom every second, or he gets physically sick\n\nYou are right to stand firm.  It is almost a guarantee that if you make an exception an allow her to bring him,  that  he will scream or do something else to tarnish your ceremony and have focus on him.   Kids who scream when their parent leaves the room will most assuredly scream at anything else that upsets or displeases them.\n\nYou said\nThey have got my mother to side with them and call me to plead their case for them\n\nI tend to think your SIL is spoiled, entitled and accustomed to getting her way. She probably has never had anyone tell her \"No\".  But it is your wedding and your right to have a peaceful child free ceremony if that is what you and your fiance want.", "NTA (assuming your fianc\u00e9e agrees). You might need to start looking for a new best man, though\u2026", "NTA OP, pay for *one more thing*. Pay  for a sitter for that one kid. When your SIL shows up with her kid, cause you know she *will*\u2026 she can have the option of\n\neither leaving the kid with the sitter and she can join the festivities\u2026\n\n*or*\n\nshe *and* the kid can go with the baby sitter to the other room far out of earshot of the other celebrants because if/when she throws a tantrum, you don\u2019t wanna hear it and baby sitters are used to dealing with meltdowns thrown by the immature\n\n*or* she and her kid can go home. \n\nHer choice. There are three ways you can do this. Not a fourth way, not the way she wants, because it\u2019s not her party and she isn\u2019t paying for it.", "NTA.  Your request is a simple one that you've set in stone from early on.\n\nHOWEVER - is your fiance backing you up 100%?  It will not bode well with you for the future if he doesn't.  Also, what are your plans when she shows up with your nephew?", "NTA at all.  This sub is full of questions about kid free weddings and there always seems to be someone who thinks they are the exception to the rule.  You made a plan, stick by it.", "NTA for your wedding rules.

Why is that weird?", "INFO:\n\n\"I set the date, the location, and the flavor of the cake.\"\n\nDid your fiancee get a say?", "\"Also, small children cause distractions, simply put.\" I kindly disagree with you, OP. I have been to a couple of weddings. One when I was younger, and one when my stepdad and mom had gotten married. And in both of those weddings, no child caused a distraction. Everybody was having fun. However, I do understand the rule of no children at the wedding. I don't think you are TA at all. Not only what you said is true about it being unfair to other people, but it's also unfair to you. You asked that there would be no children at the wedding, and your sister-in-law is asking to bring the kid regardless. Instead of being that way, she should ask another family member that has kids too if their babysitter could babysit her child too, and if their response is no, she could ask for a recommendation. Now, I do understand her fear of people outside of the family, but not all people are evil. But, in my opinion, you are NTA. You are asking for this special day to be kid-free. That is not such a bad thing to ask for. Your sister-in-law, your brother, and your mother are TA for trying to go against your wishes.", "NTA - true, it's your wedding at the end of the day.\n\nBut it doesn't mean your SIL is an AH either, she's just being a good mother to an anxious 3 year old.
