We have expressed to all our guests that we wish to have an adults only wedding and asked our guests to make arrangements (please find a babysitter) if they have children. We have several reasons. We have to keep the guest count under 50, or else two of our most expensive vendors both double their prices. Also, small children cause distractions, simply put. We know lots of people allow children at their wedding, and that's ok, we just don't prefer children at ours. Not one of our friends had any opposition to this rule. All of them considered it nice to have a break from their kids for an afternoon and were more than happy to get a babysitter. They all agreed with us that weddings aren't kid-friendly, and it's just less complicated for everyone to find a babysitter.\n\nThe only person giving us a hard time is my sister-in-law. She has what we feel is a very unhealthy relationship with her 3-year-old son. She has coddled him to the point that he screams if she leaves the room. He has to be with his mom every second, or he gets physically sick. She has that baby attached to her hip so badly that she will not allow anyone except family members to watch him, and those family members are all attending my wedding. Her and my brother are trying to guilt trip us into letting them bring my nephew to the wedding. They feel like because they are family, they are a unique circumstance and deserve a pass. We have set a boundary, and we feel like the right thing to do is enforce that boundary. \n\nTo make matters worse, they have got my mother to side with them and call me to plead their case for them. I explained to her last night that if she brings him, she will not be fully present at our wedding. She won't be able to dance with my brother (who is my best man). And if I give in, it will be unfair to all our other guests. I have accepted that my sister-in-law will not be at my wedding, and by refusing to hire a babysitter, that is the choice she is making. I am standing my ground and saying no. It's my wedding, I paid for the whole thing. I set the date, the location, and the flavor of the cake. If I say no kids, I want no kids.

I know it's a family member but the choices our people make shows a lot about them.

But when you say no kids, you have to accept that some people will not be able to attend.  Whatever else is going on with your nephew\u2019s attachment to his mother, none of that is going to magically disappear during a night with a babysitter for your wedding.  So if you hold the line on no kids, it probably means your SIL does not attend the wedding at all (and thus won\u2019t be present at your wedding or dancing with your brother anyway).", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't a summons. I don't think any explanation would satisfy your family. Ask your mother if she'd rather watch her grandson \\*not at the venue\\* or watch your wedding. It's not sarcasm. Him being there is not an option.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, given the current drama, are you prepared to hire security to kick your family out if they bring him?", "NTA. She needs to take the decision here on whether being with her child is more important than being at the wedding. And other guests might have made similar sacrifices to attend without kids and will feel put out if there is an exception made for others.", "NTA - It's your wedding, and it's totally fair to have a child-free wedding. \n\nI would say that you dip into the AH territory with your judgy attitude about your SIL's relationship to her child, but it doesn't sound like you've said any of that to *her,* so it's mostly just you being the AH internally.", "NTA. Okay, I get it. SIL is disappointed. And that is understandable. But it's your wedding. It's for you and your intended. Not her and her kid. Furthermore I am convinced that the the reality of weddings is that 9 out of 10 of them have some sort of drama about the guest list. There are only so many people who can attend and there is almost always some guest who thinks you need to squeeze in that just one more that they--the guest--need to be there with them.  \n\nYour wedding. Your guest list. SIL needs to chill.", "Nta for the reasons you stated,  which are perfectly valid!", "NTA\n \nThey can attend via Zoom.", "NTA\n\nYou said\n\nthat he screams if she leaves the room. He has to be with his mom every second, or he gets physically sick\n\nYou are right to stand firm.  It is almost a guarantee that if you make an exception an allow her to bring him,  that  he will scream or do something else to tarnish your ceremony and have focus on him.   Kids who scream when their parent leaves the room will most assuredly scream at anything else that upsets or displeases them.\n\nYou said\nThey have got my mother to side with them and call me to plead their case for them\n\nI tend to think your SIL is spoiled, entitled and accustomed to getting her way. She probably has never had anyone tell her \"No\".  But it is your wedding and your right to have a peaceful child free ceremony if that is what you and your fiance want.", "NTA (assuming your fianc\u00e9e agrees). You might need to start looking for a new best man, though\u2026", "NTA OP, pay for *one more thing*. Pay  for a sitter for that one kid. When your SIL shows up with her kid, cause you know she *will*\u2026 she can have the option of\n\neither leaving the kid with the sitter and she can join the festivities\u2026\n\n*or*\n\nshe *and* the kid can go with the baby sitter to the other room far out of earshot of the other celebrants because if/when she throws a tantrum, you don\u2019t wanna hear it and baby sitters are used to dealing with meltdowns thrown by the immature\n\n*or* she and her kid can go home. \n\nHer choice. There are three ways you can do this. Not a fourth way, not the way she wants, because it\u2019s not her party and she isn\u2019t paying for it.", "NTA.  Your request is a simple one that you've set in stone from early on.\n\nHOWEVER - is your fiance backing you up 100%?  It will not bode well with you for the future if he doesn't.  Also, what are your plans when she shows up with your nephew?", "NTA at all.  This sub is full of questions about kid free weddings and there always seems to be someone who thinks they are the exception to the rule.  You made a plan, stick by it.", "NTA for your wedding rules.

Why is that weird?", "INFO:\n\n\"I set the date, the location, and the flavor of the cake.\"\n\nDid your fiancee get a say?", "\"Also, small children cause distractions, simply put.\" I kindly disagree with you, OP. I have been to a couple of weddings. One when I was younger, and one when my stepdad and mom had gotten married. And in both of those weddings, no child caused a distraction. Everybody was having fun. However, I do understand the rule of no children at the wedding. I don't think you are TA at all. Not only what you said is true about it being unfair to other people, but it's also unfair to you. You asked that there would be no children at the wedding, and your sister-in-law is asking to bring the kid regardless. Instead of being that way, she should ask another family member that has kids too if their babysitter could babysit her child too, and if their response is no, she could ask for a recommendation. Now, I do understand her fear of people outside of the family, but not all people are evil. But, in my opinion, you are NTA. You are asking for this special day to be kid-free. That is not such a bad thing to ask for. Your sister-in-law, your brother, and your mother are TA for trying to go against your wishes.", "NTA - true, it's your wedding at the end of the day.\n\nBut it doesn't mean your SIL is an AH either, she's just being a good mother to an anxious 3 year old.

Totally fine! I would understand if a friend took that position and not attempt to convince them to change their mind.\n\nMy perspective - for my wedding - was more that if a baby lets out a shriek at an inopportune moment, it\u2019s not a big deal. You just laugh, roll your eyes at life, pause for a moment while the caregiver exits with said squawky baby, and carry on. Imo that\u2019s very different from a kid consistently shouting throughout the service, meaning guests can\u2019t hear large chunks of what is being said, and you are distracted from your own vows / the solemnity of the moment etc. \n\nThis does not mean everyone has to share my view. If someone doesn\u2019t want to risk a baby starting to cry, I get that! My friend who got the \u201cexemption\u201d at my wedding had a 3 week old. I really wanted her at the wedding. She obviously couldn\u2019t leave her 3 week old breastfed baby. So he came along, and it was all good! Ditto when I took mine to the two funerals. If my parents/cousins/ sisters had been like \u201cno, dude\u201d I wouldn\u2019t have gone. But they wanted me to be at my grandparents\u2019 funerals (I delivered the eulogy at my grandma\u2019s in fact). Both times the baby in question did make noise - very briefly - and was swiftly carried out the church/crem (husband took the aisle seat to ensure this). \n\nI was invited to a no kids wedding when my first was 4 months. It was a v good friend (I was bridesmaid) and she said if squish needed to come, he could - she really wanted me there. But I didn\u2019t want him to! I wanted to actually enjoy her wedding and not stress about a (pretty colicky) infant. So I expressed enough milk and begged and pleaded with my parents to have him for the day, which they - eventually - did\n(first and only time, lol). And me and my exploding boobs had a brilliant time! Much better than if baby had been there. \n\nMy point here is simply that, in my experience, babies are much less disruptive at adult events than toddlers or kids. And much harder to be away from, and find sitters for. And that a quick bit of one off disruption really isn\u2019t much bother. So if there\u2019s folks you really want at your wedding who have babes in arms it might be worth considering letting those tiny babies come.

It's so important that when two people are uniting themselves in front of family, or even uniting two families, it's important that everyone be able to hear and focus on this couple only, just for 20-25 minutes of the service or ceremony.  That is respectful but also serving the goal of witnessing their new unity.  When a child is brought onto the mix, they are not mature enough to understand that this is a magical moment, borne of thousands of dollars, hours of planning, and numerous vendors.  Removing focus and attention from the couple when the child reacts as a normal, bored child reduces the importance of the ceremony and the couple active within it.  Although the child is family, this particular wonderful cherished moment is not geared for or to  the child.  The $50 -100 dinner plates are not factored for children, nor are the venue, appropriate outfit, dancing, music, or potential alcohol or adult discussions.  Some weddings are created for children too and can be fun and rewarding and some are for adults, providing no toys, food, or appropriate areas for children.  Both are fine but it is disrespectful to welcome a new family member by attempting to dictate and modify a child free wedding event.  Weddings, births and funerals should not be considered as free for all family events with the hosts tied to factoring in amenities for small ( or large) children. The focus here is a couple promising to join together, being witnessed by chosen family and friends, providing the expensive amenities of a reception and meal.  Not selfish and very family oriented; just not the right place and time for little kids.  I had one important guest bring his children to my wedding and could not hear the reverend's words for the resultant cacophony drowning him out.

It can be somewhat more inconvenient for the adults, but it's essential for society for children to know what real-world weddings look like, and not only base their idea of a *real wedding* on idealized versions in movies and magazines. Plus, a lot of families don't have a lot of opportunities for all the cousins to get to know each other outside of weddings. Weddings that include children support societal functioning, even if you *personally* don't like having kids around yourself.\n\nAnyways, I *guess* if you're not going to have kids you might as well be consistent about it.

And you\u2019ll be seated in the back so you can quickly take him out.  You\u2019ll also have to miss the dances at the reception because you\u2019ll be holding him.  You\u2019ll also be cheerfully covering the full added cost of security personnel, upfront and in full, who will be there to enforce that you honor this commitment, even if it means you miss the entire wedding.  Which, let\u2019s be real, is likely what will happen.\n3.  Personally and sincerely apologize to each and every one of the wedding guests with children, explaining that \u201cI\u2019m a selfish bully who bullied them into allowing this double-standard against their will, because I play favorites, and the bride and groom aren\u2019t it.  Not even on their literal wedding day.\u201d  And probably also \u201csorry I haven\u2019t seen you for the entire wedding, I\u2019ve missed the whole thing because I\u2019ve been sitting outside in the parking lot with a bored and screaming child who didn\u2019t want to be here, but that I insisted had to come anyway.\u201d", "Wow I wonder what child hating Reddit is going to think about this post\u2026\n\nDid you really feel the need to post this?

It\u2019s not uncommon for toddlers to be very attached to their mother at that age. I wouldn\u2019t let non-family watch my son at that age. He would be too young to communicate any potential abuse and I wouldn\u2019t risk his safety to attend a wedding.

Make sure she knows she will be asked to leave if she shows up with him.", "Your sister-in-law isn't \"coddling\" your nephew. That is normal childhood behavior - to be attached to their caregiver. There is nothing wrong with her relationship with her son, and until you're a parent, you have no right judging that. Further, you do not appear to know her reasoning why she only allows family to watch him, but being a mom of 3, I find this absolutely reasonable. Heck, I've never left my kids with ANYONE and they are 1-3 and nearly 6. I'm okay with that and the childless or anyone not in my specific situation has literally 0 right to judge, as long as my kids are happy and well cared for. \n\nAs for the child free wedding. You're more than entitled to have it be kid free. I had a cousin do this recently. I just didn't go. I was fine with that, because quite frankly - I think weddings are an idiotic waste of money. You do you, but the reality is that this DOES put families in a bind. One of my cousins also has 3 children, and anyone who normally watches her kids was at the wedding. They can't afford a sitter for a night out like that, and this actually played out with multiple family members that attended because we all have little kids. The cousin getting married was also childless and didn't seem to understand the problem because her friends were fine with it, too. Well. Her friends parents weren't attending, so they all had their normal, free sitter! So maybe your brother doesn't come, then. \n\nAnyway, you can do what you want for your day, but the way you talk about your SIL and her attentive parenting to your nephew makes YTA.", "NTA, you're not singling out anyone by having a not kids allowed to everyone!!..
