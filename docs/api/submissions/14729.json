It doesn\u2019t sound like an actual apology just an excuse for his behavior and it doesn\u2019t sound like the snapping is a one time thing. You don\u2019t owe anyone forgiveness but I would take the time he is away to think about how you are treated and have a bigger discussion once he comes back.", "NTA. You\u2019re well within your rights to be angry. And disappointed that a grown man can\u2019t handle his emotions better than that. And disgusted that he called you that word, for whatever reason. He is acting like a giant abusive baby.", "NTA. You're in an abusive marriage. This is verbal abuse. Please talk to somebody.", "NTA\n\nNope, nope, nope. \n\nThere is no excuse for name calling. \n\nYou have a child that is soaking in every word you both say.\n\nThere needs to be a very clear boundary set immediately that certain words and behaviors are not part of a respectful marriage. Period.\n\nNope.", "Catch me dead before I'd stay in a marriage with someone that called me a ct.", "NTA. Here\u2019s the thing: when you have small kids, everything can feel exhausting. As someone who travels a lot for work, I understand how tiring it can be to go away, be \u201con\u201d then come home and need to pick up the slack you left behind. \n\nBut there\u2019s ZERO excuse for his behavior. That name calling was intended to hurt you - a quick apology isn\u2019t going to cut it here. Consider telling him \u201cThat word is a hard limit for me. If you call me it again, there will be consequences.\u201d \n\nVerbal abuse can often escalate into much worse. Set some boundaries now.", "NTA. Uh, hon? That is not how someone who loves you acts.", "NTA - I didn't read he apologized to you. You may have a habit of apologizing when he did not meet you in the middle and apologize for his behavior. Not allowing you to wash your hands & throwing c\\*\\* around is hurtful and demeaning. It's weird he gets a 'pass' cause he's stressed. Best to you.", "NTA - One does not simply call someone that and then expect smooches and smiles.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy does the \"bigger\" person always need to be you? What would happen if you treated him the same way?", "NTA.  Let him suffer some more so the lesson is learned", "WHAT!?!?!   NTA.\n\nI would be LIVID.", "NTA!!! I spent years forgiving my husband's BS, always believing the abuse  would stop and he would go back to being the perfect sweetheart I fell in love with. It never got better, and neither did he. But you really SHOULD say goodbye to him. Once abusers know that you will take the abuse, they tend to stop pretending to be who you thought they were, and it just gets worse and worse.", "NTA I doubt very much he'd do that to anyone at work; he can control it. Why does he think it's ok to act this way to you?", "NTA. I'm soo sorry your husband said that to you. I know we tend to snap at each other in relationships but to call you that is a absolute no. A man should never say that to his wife.", "NTA. \n\nThere are plenty of other ways he could vent his stress. He could take deep breaths, he could rip up pieces of paper, he could angrily pace around an empty room. He could work out or play a violent video game. He could pick up a stuffed toy or a rubber duck and tell it that he's very disappointed in its performance this quarter. \n\nBut instead of any of those, he chooses to vent his stress by snapping at you.\n\nIf he doesn't find another way, eventually snapping will become a reflex. A habit. It won't even do much for his stress. So he'll find ways to escalate.", "NTA but please call an abuse hotline. You need help.\nEdit: please see below comment of mine for a nicer explanation", "Totally unacceptable!  Draw a hard line and do not put up with this. He doesn\u2019t get a pass this time. I\u2019m angry on your behalf.", "NTA and I'm concerned about the fact that this isn't an isolated incident.\n\nIt's one thing to be on edge and need space. It's another to bar their partner from a sink and call them a name for daring to need to wash their hands.", "NTA. I don't care how stressed someone is it is not ok to call you that for using a sink he wasn't using to take care of your child. Honestly I'd be VERY unhappy with my husband if he ever said something like this to me. But I grew up with disgusting parents so my husband knows that any kind of name calling is a hard no fucking way in my book. You can get mad, you can have a tone, you can be short. You can not call names. For me that's a deal breaker. I know it's not for others & that's totally fine. I'm not saying it has to be. But please really think about the big picture with him before you decide on anything. I literally can't even imagine the scenario we would be in that would result in my husband calling me a cunt... We're kind of \"vanilla\" that way I guess? Idk...to me this is wildly not ok... I definitely would not be the one to apologize in this situation.... Good luck op!", "NTA. He crossed the line for calling you that word when all you wanted to do was wash your hands at a sink he was not using.", "Do not go to marriage counseling with an abusive person. \nNTA\nI think you should separate within the home and decide if you want to raise a child who calls his beloved a Ct for not scrambling out of the way because he\u2019s rushed and impatient. Do you want to have a daughter whose spouse calls her Ct and she accepts it because you did? \nI\u2019d rather be alone. \nIt\u2019s one thing to think a spouse is stressed and accommodate a little impatient comment. It\u2019s another to call you a ct.\nI\u2019d probably go see a lawyer. Quietly. \nPeople like that seldom change and usually get worse.", "NTA. You needed more time to grock the situation. Just because he apologized doesn\u2019t mean you have to meet him there.\n\nYou weren\u2019t great by telling him to call you a cunt again, try not to rebut in anger.\n\nUm who tells their wife they are not allowed to wash diaper dirty hands in a sink near them?", "NTA. You have no need to apologize. This man is a universal and doesn't respect you. There's NO excuse for him calling you a cunnnt for washing your hands.", "NTA. Most people I know who are stressed by their jobs do not lash out at their significant others and call them nasty names while they\u2019re merely trying to wash their hands. He should have said thanks for taking care of the baby.", "The stuff you are both angry at arent important. Why is he so stressed about his trip?", "YTA he was trying to be the bigger person and apologize after you very RUDELY invaded his space in the bathroom. Man needed a private minute and you just couldn\u2019t\u2026 you should be apologizing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or the cat. I don't care how stressed he is, you do not call someone you love and respect.", "Uh, he called you a cu t?!?!??! NTA and unless he's willing to put in some serious work to fix this I'd be out. That's the ultimate disrespect right there. Actually I'd just be out, no chance to work through something like that, but that's just me.", "Exactly what I came here to say. The fact that he snaps at her a lot says so much about him. \n\nI\u2019ve been in an abusive marriage before, and the yelling out of nowhere was key. Of course I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, and he always made it seem like it was my fault. \n\nOP, your husband needs to see a therapist. If he\u2019s stressed about work he needs to talk to someone about it, not take it out on you. What if he starts taking it out on your baby next? NTA", "He called you a c***.For washing your hands in a sink next to him. This is not normal. Even if he\u2019d given you a real apology, this is abusive.", "you can love someone and still act like that. (this is not an excuse just a fact.)", "It is 4 hours away so he wasn't excited about the drive. He also has to deal with people he isn't a fan of who don't like him much back.

He has some serious anger issues.", "Of course you're NTA, but are you always in the habit of justifying his awful behavior ? Because that indicates you've been putting up with this way too long."]}
