If he makes that threat over a bag of chips, I imagine he's a rather manipulative person / parent. Even if he would not follow through, it's an awful thing to threat for something so small and irrelevant. If you were going to pay for the chips, the only reason he'd care if you bought them or not is simply control. \n\nI would not accept his apology either because he is a manipulative person who needs control. His apology is likely only because he wanted you to cook for Thanksgiving, and perhaps doesn't want you to leave the house because you cook every night, likely do other things for him and also he would have no control over you. He is unlikely genuinely sorry and doesn't recognize how toxic he is. \n\nBut if he threatened to kick you out over a bag of chips, I would fear that he actually would for \"ruining\" Thanksgiving. \n\nCould your siblings help prepare at all? Is your father capable of cooking at all for himself? You did not ruin or cancel Thanksgiving. Just because you were the one who was going to cook and now no longer will, if someone else could step up and cook, or multiple people could do it together and they all decide not to, then they have now decided to cancel Thanksgiving.
