If he makes that threat over a bag of chips, I imagine he's a rather manipulative person / parent. Even if he would not follow through, it's an awful thing to threat for something so small and irrelevant. If you were going to pay for the chips, the only reason he'd care if you bought them or not is simply control. \n\nI would not accept his apology either because he is a manipulative person who needs control. His apology is likely only because he wanted you to cook for Thanksgiving, and perhaps doesn't want you to leave the house because you cook every night, likely do other things for him and also he would have no control over you. He is unlikely genuinely sorry and doesn't recognize how toxic he is. \n\nBut if he threatened to kick you out over a bag of chips, I would fear that he actually would for \"ruining\" Thanksgiving. \n\nCould your siblings help prepare at all? Is your father capable of cooking at all for himself? You did not ruin or cancel Thanksgiving. Just because you were the one who was going to cook and now no longer will, if someone else could step up and cook, or multiple people could do it together and they all decide not to, then they have now decided to cancel Thanksgiving.

Not the broken foot though lol.\n\nPeople don't get to make such huge threats without any consequences. It's extremely damaging to relationships and is abusive behavior through and through.

You need to understand that *Reddit is wrong about this* and that his \"idle threat\" is what he's thinking about a lot.  You're 18, and he doesn't legally have to house you anymore; he's thinking a lot about giving you the boot and hasn't done it yet because you're still useful to him.  The moment you stop being useful to him, you *will* be out on your ass.

It may be wiser for her to make the dinner, keep her head down until her foot heals and she can work again, while looking for other living arrangements. It really sucks, but until she has other options, it may be her only option right now, unfortunately.", "And even if he does kick her out, legally she can go to the cops and say she wasn\u2019t \u201cevicted\u201d properly by being given the 30 day notice.", "Lmao I thought it was a funny coincidence", "If the responsibility in question aggravates the injury/illness?

If she just quit her job and dropped out of school because she broke her foot then there are larger issues at play.  There was also no question of cooking the dinner for the foot.

So, yeah, it IS the reason why she isn\u2019t working, and it\u2019s a pretty fair reason.
