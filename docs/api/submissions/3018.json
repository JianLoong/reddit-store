Also for the past few weeks he has also been doubting me being able to make everything for thanksgiving and thinks it'll be a disaster (even though I cook dinner everyday for the whole family) and thinks nothing will be good especially the turkey.\n\nSo when we got home I was so upset about everything and told him that HE can handle thanksgiving (for 7 people) and that I'm not doing a thing.

As children we\u2019re taught that actions have consequences. Maybe he now needs a lesson of actions and consequences.\n\nI hope you have options to stay with other people, like friends or other family. Your dad\u2019s actions and behavior are not good for your mental health. Staying away from him will do you better.", "NTA - your dad is being manipulative, regardless of how tired he is.", "NTA.  He expects you to make Thanksgiving dinner with a broken foot?  You need to get out and get away as soon as possible.  Get into therapy as soon as you can as well to work on your depression.  It is hard because you are in an abusive setting.", "NTA 100% your Dad sounds awful. But what is stopping him from kicking you out of the house for not cooking? It's clearly a threat he likes to use to control you. Honestly I would try and stay with a friend or their family until you can work again and save up to live on your own since your home life doesn't sound like a good environment for you.", "NTA.  Don\u2019t you do a dare thing.  He really wanted to sabotage Thanksgiving over some chips???  How dare he.  He can cook.", "NTA, you're in a terrible situation.\n\nI'd take whatever steps you can to be gone if you can be somewhere safer.  Do you have other relatives or good friends who can offer you a place to stay till your back on your feet?", "He broke his promise.\n\nIf he wants it perfect - then perhaps he should have used his big brain for once.\n\nNow - of course - do tell others that HE is the cause - and that an apology was given but since he broke the promise (again?) you do not trust him.\n\nThreating with kicking people out just because of a small snack he\\`s not even paying for?  \n Daddy\\`s got issues.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If he makes that threat over a bag of chips, I imagine he's a rather manipulative person / parent. Even if he would not follow through, it's an awful thing to threat for something so small and irrelevant. If you were going to pay for the chips, the only reason he'd care if you bought them or not is simply control. \n\nI would not accept his apology either because he is a manipulative person who needs control. His apology is likely only because he wanted you to cook for Thanksgiving, and perhaps doesn't want you to leave the house because you cook every night, likely do other things for him and also he would have no control over you. He is unlikely genuinely sorry and doesn't recognize how toxic he is. \n\nBut if he threatened to kick you out over a bag of chips, I would fear that he actually would for \"ruining\" Thanksgiving. \n\nCould your siblings help prepare at all? Is your father capable of cooking at all for himself? You did not ruin or cancel Thanksgiving. Just because you were the one who was going to cook and now no longer will, if someone else could step up and cook, or multiple people could do it together and they all decide not to, then they have now decided to cancel Thanksgiving. Not you. Maybe no one else is old enough, physically able, or simply doesn't know how to cook but IF others can - then why don't they? \n\nI wouldn't want to cook for your dad in this situation either, especially if he'll be a jerk, rude or AH if it's not \"perfect\" but if all my siblings were younger and couldn't do it themselves I'd probably still cook. Or if they could cook or Dad can cook, I'd only do it if people helped. And then I'd try my best to GTFO of that house and the toxic situation/relationship.", "Nta", "Nta, aside from your dad being a manipulative asshole, why are you expected to stand in the kitchen and cook for seven people with a broken foot?\nIf any of your family members complain you can let them know that your dad threatened to make you homeless over a bag of chips.", "NTA he shouldn't have snapped at you or threatened to throw you out over a bag of chips wth Drama Dad?!?\n\nThat said, he did apologize and this isn't just about him, it's about the whole family and your promises to your siblings. I would still cook dinner but only with the understanding that you're doing it for THEM and not for him, and he has to do the dishes.", "NTA\n\nIt's not ok for him to hold this threat over you to control every little thing down to a bag of chips. I wish there was a way you could move out and not be beholden to him, but that doesn't sound possible at the moment.\n\nAs much as I dislike the idea, it might be worth still cooking for your siblings and making it clear to him that you're not doing this for him, but for them, and tell him to stay out of the kitchen and not speak to you on Thanksgiving - so at least he's not hassling you or making you doubt yourself. And just doing whatever you can in the future to get out of there so you no longer have to put up with him. In thanksgivings in the future you can invite everyone else and NOT him!", "NTA - but apparently being the bigger person is a thing", "ESH but for different reasons.\n\nAt least your dad apologised.  He may have been cranky with what was happening and it being crowded etc.  But it doesn't make it right.  If this is his usual treatment of you, perhaps you need to consider moving out.  Hopefully your foot heals soon so you can get a job and be able to do this.\n\nThe food is already bought, so for your siblings sake I would cook this meal for them.  I'd be telling your dad you will not tolerate any more comments.  You can tell him if he dares say anything that you will stop cooking at whatever point you are at and he can finish so he better not even consider a word.  Draw your line in the sand.", "ESH. It's time to accept his apology with the caveat that he helps with preparing the meal. And your siblings need to help as well even if it's with small tasks. Everything shouldn't fall on you.\n\nAnd your dad needs to come up with something else to say when he's upset with you other than threatening you with kicking you out. You two need to discus this. Maybe with a family counselor.\n\nEDIT: For other reddit commenters horrified and think OP should burn abusive dad down (figuratively, not literally), I invite them to remember that OP is currently injured and has no source of income. They are dependent upon dad to physically survive right now. Be morally outraged all you like, but don't give dangerous advice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
