He will definitely resist every attempt at discipline you give him", "NTA. Your daughter lost the right to dictate who raises her child or how he\u2019s raised the moment she was convicted. If cousin\u2019s mother wants to drop her two cents, she can step up to the plate which I doubt she\u2019s willing to do so. Cousin is doing right by this child, coming to you first before relinquishing him to the foster care system.", "NTA.  Her cousin is not an option. You are.  CPS will likely place him with you as this is in the best interest   of the child.", "NTA. Get custody. Show him discipline and love. You worry about driving your daughter fully away but that has already happened. She is in prison. For a long time you said. The health and well being of the child are the most important things here.", "NTA. It might not be what your daughter wants, and she likely thinks she knows best having what sounds like a fairly opposite style of parenting to your own, most likely because she doesn't agree with it, but it sounds like considering he's not a great kid it would be good for him to get some structure and discipline and she just might have not raised him quite right so far.\n\nIt does have to be considered that at the end of the day he's not your child and so final decisions are not down to you. But, from the other side, it doesn't sound like your daughter is exactly in the best position to be guiding a child through whatever stage of growing up he's at.\n\nThe cousin doesn't want him in her house. So what real other options are there? Is your sister aware of this, is she proposing the cousin take him in anyway with no regard for her desires?\n\nDoes your daughter see any wrong in the behaviour of her son? Perhaps if she knows he's not the most well behaved, in the end it might end up that she sees it was a good thing that he got some more structure, a male figure of authority, and discipline in his life. It sounds like it would be beneficial in the long run.", "NTA\n\nYou're not taking the child away from your daughter's preferred guardian, the preferred guardian has asked you to take the child.

You can ask your cousin\u2019s mom if she\u2019s offering to take him in instead. If your daughter\u2019s preferred guardians aren\u2019t up for it, then it goes to whoever is able and willing. If that means it\u2019s you, then so be it. \n\nI do agree with the poster up thread who mentioned you may have to adapt tactics (without being as laissez about it as your daughter has been). Different children respond differently to things. What makes one child thrive can push another in an opposite direction and vice versa. I also recommend getting him in therapy ASAP if you take him in.", "nta .... but you do realize that your daughter raised her kid with no boundaries as a consequence of the restrictions and barriers you put on her growing up i was sent to boarding school because i lived in a warzone and because i was so restricted in every aspect of my life i refused to commit to anything that would tie me down .... some people do well being raised with strict boundaries and others rebel severely against them   \nIf  you do take your grandchild in maybe instead of raising the kid exactly how you raised their mother try to adapt tactics", "Actually, you sound like great parents. You tried to teach her responsibility and to encourage her hobbies, and she didn\u2019t appreciate the logic behind the reality of what you were trying to do. \n\nFor years, you attempted to build her up to set her up for success, but now the dominoes have fallen in the way that they now lie, and your daughter has now failed to reach the goals in life you tried to help her to attain.\n\nThe push and pull and her ultimate downfall is what has led her to hit rock bottom. Had she made the right choices in life and had believed in herself, and if only she had done what was necessary to obtain the things she wanted out of life, maybe, *just maybe*, her life would not have gotten so twisted, out of control, and sucked into a downward spiral. You tried to form the sunrise, and unfortunately, at no fault of your own, you ultimately created a tornado.\n\nIn the wake of her destruction and the concluding aftermath, you are now faced with a decision that you are ultimately forced to make. The only flesh and blood willing to selflessly sacrifice their time and patience to come forward and raise her children are the very people who set her up for success just to see her life crash before her eyes and get absorbed into a black hole of failure.\n\n**If she is unwilling to allow you to take her child in and to set him up for success as you tried to do with your own, you must take the steps necessary- even if that means going in front of a judge- to save her child and to provide him with a better life.**\n\n**NTA.**\n\nEdit: I saw someone comment and delete their comment that this feels like a \u201c*creative writing exercise*\u201d.

What your sister is saying is irrelevant. Same thing about your daughter wishes. The grandson doesn\u2019t have another place to go than your place. Your daughter has to accept that.

She's going to jail and has already screwed her son up!", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter is not taking accountability for the actions that made her go to prison and she is instead blaming you, who taught the importance of rules in the first place - and which she broke big time.\n\nSo that is it: need to avoid accountability. So placing kid with cousin would be \"protection\" him according to her own narrative.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister is so interested in keeping the kids from you, she can take him.  Cousin probably should flat out tell your daughter that she cannot take the child.  Maybe even in writing through the court or your daughter's lawyer.  (That would make it a little more official.)  No one can force cousin to take the child in.  \n\nHaving the cousin go through your daughter's lawyer can help if the lawyer has a Come to Jesus talk with your daughter about what will happen if she does not have a viable plan for her son.  If she is willing to give you guardianship/custody/whatever now, she can negotiate with you on the terms.  If she doesn't have a workable plan when she goes to prison, the court will give her one.  This kind of case is actually why grandparents' rights laws were written.  \n\nI would suggest that you get your own lawyer to help navigate the system.  Also have family and individual therapy lined up and figure out what you are going to tell the schools.", "ESH. You raised your daughter too strictly and with an authoritarian approach. In turn, she raised her child with not enough structured and a hands off take.\nNotice how both children (your daughter, and now her son) that were subjected to these extremes aren\u2019t well adjusted?", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter has committed a crime, but I don't think she's an asshole for the question at hand, which is deciding who gets custody.\n\nWhere you lose me specifically is describing her as a \"single mother by choice\". Like what are the high-earning tall good men just banging down her door and she's just like \"no I hate men (and women and NB) and I like being a poor\". \n\nAdditionally, your description of how you raised her is nothing short of \"we were absolutely perfect and she's just like some type of a demon, behold she's a single mother accused of a financial crime\".\n\nLet's also add cousin's mom trying to force cousin to foster a kid she doesn't want to, and you being TA for not forcing her to. \n\n\nCool story. As far as who has custody. If cousin doesn't want the kid, y'all need to tell the mom and ask her who she would like to have instead. If no one wants the kid, offer again.

I had a few because I know circumstances change, and folks may not be able to take on my child if the time came. Legally, you can suggest a guardian, but it generally isn\u2019t binding. Taking on a child is a choice, and your niece has every right to decline. Stepping up and taking on your grandchild\u2019s care is a great service and act of love: it\u2019ll also be very very hard from what it sounds like. I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s a type of therapist who specializes in this kind of thing, but you might check.\n\nYou might check to see if they\u2019ve been active in SMC social groups and if he\u2019s met up with any half siblings\u2014maintaining those connections (or even making them) could help with the transition.", "NTA. While you brought her up with discipline and a few rules, it was nothing out of the ordinary. You allowed her to have choices too. Of course it all depends on how it was perceived. Some think that a firm 'no' is an affort to their freedom. Her perception (and not your parenting) made her choose her path which eventually led her to prison. Some people want easy money without the hard work.\n\nHer kid needs structure and I think you can provide that. Encourage open communication with your grandson, and when you need to punish him, explain why. I hope that eventually he grows to a decent human being and not end up in jail too.", "NTA, it's never a bad thing to be willing to give a child a home if you're fit and can provide a loving space. \n\nThat said, I can't think of anything that will blow up worse than you approaching your daughter to convince her, and even if she agreed, that's not totally how it works. Your daughter can tell social services she wants the cousin to have guardianship, but if cousin declines, then social services will look to other family members to take him. You should talk to THEM and make sure they know you are available if necessary. Your daughter might tell them she doesn't want you, and they may move on to a new person. There is only so much control you all have at this point.", "NTA, and help the child", "NTA. i really just hope you approach this from a therapeutic perspective the best you can", "NTA.  You're in a bad situation.  Your daughter doesn't understand what's at stake.  She can't just decide that her cousin will take on the responsibility of raising your grandson.  Her cousin has the option of saying no.  Her cousin can walk into the visiting room and say \"I'm sorry.  Your son is a bully and out of control.  I have my own family to think of and I can't expose them to your son.\"  Then she can turn and walk out.  She can also write a letter saying the same thing.\n\nIf your daughter doesn't want her son with you, perhaps she should gift him to your sister.  After all, she thinks family should take him, she's family, so why shouldn't she take him.  As hard as it may be to hear this, foster care may be the best option.  You haven't mentioned your ages or his age, but if he's a bully and \"a bit wild,\" are you really sure you want to try to deal with that?  He's not going to react well when you start imposing rules and consequences when he's never had them before.  If his behavior is bad now, it will likely get worse.

Plus, there's no guarantee that you actually would be able to help him.", "NTA -- The cousin is clearly not taking him.

Your relationship with your daughter is already fractured, but you do have a chance to help her son and you're willing to take it in spite of acknowledging how hard it's going to be.

Your sister is only involved in this situation and validating the feelings of your daughter, who is going to jail and will no longer be having custody in her child, and getting to demand that people who don't want her son take custody.\n\nThat's what this comes down to, your sister is saying that because her daughter was volunteered by yours to take care of her full human child, cousin just needs to do what she's told.\n\nYour daughter has already chosen to go away. You didn't drive her away she chose to leave, and she has chosen to make selfish choices at the expense of her child and is still attempting to make choices at his expense. Talking around to try and pressure someone who doesn't want her son in the house and saying that no one else but her can take custody, is doing a disservice to her kid.

If you want to pursue custody of your grandson, just do so and don't talk with your daughter about it, cuz he's already made it clear that she doesn't want you to take custody, but can she really have an opinion over who has custody of her kid when she isn't going to be parenting him anymore?", "If the cousin doesn\u2019t want to foster the kid, your daughters opinions and wants don\u2019t matter.", "I\u2019m one!

As for the child you might think he needs discipline (and that may be the case) but he first and foremost needs a therapist.  What he is experiencing is trauma and he may act out and going heavy handed with the discipline may make him act out even worse.  With your daughters behavior I would also wonder if she has some underlying issues which may explain her path.  Seeing a therapist will be critical for the child to adjust with his mom going to jail, the very life changing circumstances he will be experiencing, anything he may have experienced in the past, and seeing if he may also have some underlying issues his mother didn\u2019t give him support.  Good luck.", "NTA The cousin needs to stand up and refuse to take in a child she knows she can't handle and not let your daughter bully or guilt her into it. That -- her refusing custody she doesn't want -- is unquestionable. Once that happens, you won't be the AH for applying to take in your grandson, even if your daughter objects.", "NTA. I'm not exactly sure how strict you were with your daughter but it sounds rather reasonable to me with the rules you described. Furthered evidenced by the fact that her own son is wild and out of control which kind of implies to me at least, that she set up the loose parenting situation she wanted growing up which clearly doesn't work if he's out of control. One of my closest friends grew up like that. Her mother resented her parents strict parenting style and ended up letting her and her beother roam free. They did not end up well to say the least... she and I are no longer friends because I couldn't handle being around her anymore. If your cousin doesn't want to take the boy in I'd say go for it. I hope the best for all of you.", "i was gonna say that you\u2019re not TA but then i saw your replies and lemme just say, yikes\u2026 i don\u2019t think you\u2019re the most reliable narrator given your responses to the questions asked in the comments. you seem to completely lack empathy towards your daughter.

There's a separate conflict that needs to happen here, and it comes from the cousin needing to tell your daughter that your daughter doesn't get to volunteer her for things, and send her mother after her to bully her.

You can try to talk to her again but honestly it sounds like the ship has sailed on there being any possibility of you guys having a good relationship again, if she was more willing to either force her cousin to take custody, or have her son sent to foster care over living with you. It sounds like you need to give up on your daughter and just focus on your grandson", "This exactly, it sounds like the daughter thinks that she can force her cousin into taking custody of her kid.

She doesn't get to make choices for somebody else's house and tell other people that they are forced to take custody of her kid entirely so she can throw up the middle finger to her parents\n\nThere's a reason to force it because from her position, the mother of this child is saying she would rather her kid go to foster care than with her parents. She's being an asshole and they should step in, given that CPS will go to them first for placement over foster care unless their house is deemed safe", "I have three other kids that are well established in their careers and have started families of their own.  They aren't in jail.", "I mean, what she saying there is that you should stay out of it so that the cousin feels she has no other option other than to send the kid to Foster care, so your sister and everyone else in the family can successfully bully her into taking custody of your grandson. They are trying to corner your niece so she has no other option other than being a villain and has to take custody. Your sister is an asshole", "You're making a lot of assumptions, nowhere does OP state that daughter would prefer foster care to her parents, no reason to think daughter is talking to aunt or even knows that cousin doesn't want custody.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are definitely reasons to force if it it comes to that, I was just saying I'm not sure whether that would make them assholes or not, leaning towards not but it would depend on new information.", "Why is that relevant to whether her wishes should be taken into account about the guardianship of her son?\n\nThis is more or less why I question whether you are these perfect parents.

Well when college came her dad put rules down and she followed them cuz if she didn't she'd have to work and get money for college. She wanted to attend a college 10 hrs from home. He refused. 2 hrs max so she could still come home every other wknd. So it's not always on parents and the rules! I would of jumped at doing whatever would give me a career and free ride! OP you are NTA. Your kid thinks she is above it all. If her son doesn't soon change his future is looking like jail.", "NTA. Do what is best for your grandson.", "For one thing, the cousin does not want him, it would be a very bad idea to leave the kid with him. If OP had custody, he would give the kid structure so he doesn't turn out like his .", "How so?", "As parents, we all wish we could do better with our children. However, not all children are capable of growing up into adults who can follow rules. I've seen it in my extended family and in my own immediate family. Out of my kids (all raised the same, all have the same expectations and rules), there was one who could not follow the rules. This is the child that stole from anyone and everyone, became an addict, spent time in county and state lock up, wrecked cars, resisted arrest, ended up homeless, and would get physical with other people (younger and older). I have several family members with multiple kids who also had \"that one kid.\" So please, don't be so hard on yourself. 99% of parents go into parenthood with the idea that they are going to do their best to raise a child to be a successful adult. So, unless you were placing unrealistic rules and expectations on her (it doesn't sound like you did), then her actions belong to her, not you.\n\nThat being said, NTA. For this reason: your sister's child does NOT want your grandson. You aren't pressuring her not to take him. SHE approached you about this. Your sister needs to butt out if she can't support her own daughter's wishes about not wanting your grandson in her house. It's wonderful that you are willing to take him knowing that he is already having behavioral issues. Truthfully, placing your grandson in a home with other children may not be the best thing for those other children. Especially if your grandson has a history of being a bully. It may be best for you or someone else to take him at least on a temporary basis and slowly introduce him into the home of your niece (if she decides later on that she is willing to take him) to see how he treats her children. Unfortunately for your grandson, your niece is placing her own children's safety and comfort first (which she most definitely should). Maybe with counseling, your grandson could come to the realization that if he changes his behaviors, more opportunities for a permanent placement would become available. \n\nThis whole situation sucks for almost everyone involved. Your niece because her mom doesn't support her decision not to take your grandson, you because it's a difficult task to raise a grandchild and because you have some feelings of regret over your daughter and your grandson because of how he has been raised thus far and can't see that he needs to make some changes so that he doesn't end up in the same situation as his mom. I wish you all the best in your futures.", "> What is a \"single mother by choice\".\n\nSomeone who had a one-night stand with a sperm donor who turned out to be a bad, bad person and whose involvement in a child's life would do more damage than good?
