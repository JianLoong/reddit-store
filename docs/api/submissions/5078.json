Her extracurriculars in high school and her college electives were completely up to her.  \n\nShe has been convicted of a financial crime and she will be away for a while.  She wants her son to stay with her cousin.  That isn't a problem. Her cousin is a good person.  She is a great mom and her husband is a good provider.  \n\nHowever the cousin approached me to say that she doesn't want my grandson there.  He is a bully and sort of wild. My daughter tried to raise him with no real discipline. She wants me to go with her to see my daughter and tell her it would be better if my grandson stays with me.  \n\nI am afraid that my daughter will react poorly since she knows that her son will be exposed to limits on his behaviour.  My husband and I have already spoken and if it becomes an issue we will go to court to seek guardianship of my grandson.  \n\nMy sister, her cousin's mom, is calling me an asshole for not just following my daughter's wishes.  Her daughter has spoken with her about why she doesn't want him in her home long term.  But she just says that he is family and that she should just do the right thing. \n\nI am really conflicted.

He will definitely resist every attempt at discipline you give him", "NTA. Your daughter lost the right to dictate who raises her child or how he\u2019s raised the moment she was convicted. If cousin\u2019s mother wants to drop her two cents, she can step up to the plate which I doubt she\u2019s willing to do so. Cousin is doing right by this child, coming to you first before relinquishing him to the foster care system.", "NTA.  Her cousin is not an option. You are.  CPS will likely place him with you as this is in the best interest   of the child.", "NTA. Get custody. Show him discipline and love. You worry about driving your daughter fully away but that has already happened. She is in prison. For a long time you said. The health and well being of the child are the most important things here.", "NTA. It might not be what your daughter wants, and she likely thinks she knows best having what sounds like a fairly opposite style of parenting to your own, most likely because she doesn't agree with it, but it sounds like considering he's not a great kid it would be good for him to get some structure and discipline and she just might have not raised him quite right so far.\n\nIt does have to be considered that at the end of the day he's not your child and so final decisions are not down to you. But, from the other side, it doesn't sound like your daughter is exactly in the best position to be guiding a child through whatever stage of growing up he's at.\n\nThe cousin doesn't want him in her house. So what real other options are there? Is your sister aware of this, is she proposing the cousin take him in anyway with no regard for her desires?\n\nDoes your daughter see any wrong in the behaviour of her son? Perhaps if she knows he's not the most well behaved, in the end it might end up that she sees it was a good thing that he got some more structure, a male figure of authority, and discipline in his life. It sounds like it would be beneficial in the long run.", "NTA\n\nYou're not taking the child away from your daughter's preferred guardian, the preferred guardian has asked you to take the child. If your daughter disagrees, there can be a discussion about what's best for her son. I wouldn't jump straight to court orders, but I understand that as a last resort.", "NTA but it\u2019s on your cousin to say no to your daughter.", "NTA if the person your daughter wants her child to go too does not want him in her home you are a good person for stepping up to take care of him.", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re trying to do the right thing here in any way possible. The only AH here is your daughter.", "NTA. Wait, so it\u2019s your sister, your nieces mother, who is saying you should MAKE her daughter, your niece, raise your grandchild according to your daughters wishes, against the request of said niece?!?  What???", "NTA. The cousin doesn\u2019t want to take him in so you offering to do so is more than okay.", "Going to say NTA if it comes to it. But it us her son and decision to have the cousin take custody.", "NTA. The overriding concern right now needs to be what is best for your grandson.", "NTA. You can ask your cousin\u2019s mom if she\u2019s offering to take him in instead. If your daughter\u2019s preferred guardians aren\u2019t up for it, then it goes to whoever is able and willing. If that means it\u2019s you, then so be it. \n\nI do agree with the poster up thread who mentioned you may have to adapt tactics (without being as laissez about it as your daughter has been). Different children respond differently to things. What makes one child thrive can push another in an opposite direction and vice versa. I also recommend getting him in therapy ASAP if you take him in.", "nta .... but you do realize that your daughter raised her kid with no boundaries as a consequence of the restrictions and barriers you put on her growing up i was sent to boarding school because i lived in a warzone and because i was so restricted in every aspect of my life i refused to commit to anything that would tie me down .... some people do well being raised with strict boundaries and others rebel severely against them   \nIf  you do take your grandchild in maybe instead of raising the kid exactly how you raised their mother try to adapt tactics", "Actually, you sound like great parents. You tried to teach her responsibility and to encourage her hobbies, and she didn\u2019t appreciate the logic behind the reality of what you were trying to do. \n\nFor years, you attempted to build her up to set her up for success, but now the dominoes have fallen in the way that they now lie, and your daughter has now failed to reach the goals in life you tried to help her to attain.\n\n***Now, you\u2019re faced with a difficult decision that could mean this child\u2019s rise or downfall, and you feel a knot in the pit of your stomach as you try to weigh the consequences.***\n\nThe push and pull and her ultimate downfall is what has led her to hit rock bottom. Had she made the right choices in life and had believed in herself, and if only she had done what was necessary to obtain the things she wanted out of life, maybe, *just maybe*, her life would not have gotten so twisted, out of control, and sucked into a downward spiral. You tried to form the sunrise, and unfortunately, at no fault of your own, you ultimately created a tornado.\n\nIn the wake of her destruction and the concluding aftermath, you are now faced with a decision that you are ultimately forced to make. The only flesh and blood willing to selflessly sacrifice their time and patience to come forward and raise her children are the very people who set her up for success just to see her life crash before her eyes and get absorbed into a black hole of failure.\n\nNow, you are conflicted. *What exactly do you do?* *Do you risk placing him with someone who admits that they do not wish to take care of him, or to you take the task upon yourself?*\n\nAs the smoke clears and the ashes fade away and the destruction leaves you shaken as you try to create a path within the ruins to rescue the precious remainder of whatever legacy she has left, the decision is now in front of you and is staring at you within the depths of a blinding light in the near distance, and the echos from your inner conscience are now loud and clear for all to hear.\n\n**If she is unwilling to allow you to take her child in and to set him up for success as you tried to do with your own, you must take the steps necessary- even if that means going in front of a judge- to save her child and to provide him with a better life.**\n\n**NTA.**", "NTA \n\nThe cousin does not want him in her home. She can\u2019t be forced to t as ke him. Next best thing is grandparents.", "NTA at all for offering, maybe if you force it? cousin not wanting him seems like a pretty major factor to me, dunno if your daughter will agree but then she sounds awful at parenting.", "I am sorry, but your niece doesn\u2019t want your grandson with her. What your sister is saying is irrelevant. Same thing about your daughter wishes. The grandson doesn\u2019t have another place to go than your place. Your daughter has to accept that. NTA.", "NTA, someone needs to step in and undo all the awful crap that kid has been taught. Who cares what your daughter wants? She's going to jail and has already screwed her son up!", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter is not taking accountability for the actions that made her go to prison and she is instead blaming you, who taught the importance of rules in the first place - and which she broke big time.\n\nSo that is it: need to avoid accountability. So placing kid with cousin would be \"protection\" him according to her own narrative.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister is so interested in keeping the kids from you, she can take him.  Cousin probably should flat out tell your daughter that she cannot take the child.  Maybe even in writing through the court or your daughter's lawyer.  (That would make it a little more official.)  No one can force cousin to take the child in.  \n\nHaving the cousin go through your daughter's lawyer can help if the lawyer has a Come to Jesus talk with your daughter about what will happen if she does not have a viable plan for her son.  If she is willing to give you guardianship/custody/whatever now, she can negotiate with you on the terms.  If she doesn't have a workable plan when she goes to prison, the court will give her one.  This kind of case is actually why grandparents' rights laws were written.  \n\nI would suggest that you get your own lawyer to help navigate the system.  Also have family and individual therapy lined up and figure out what you are going to tell the schools.", "ESH. You raised your daughter too strictly and with an authoritarian approach. In turn, she raised her child with not enough structured and a hands off take.\nNotice how both children (your daughter, and now her son) that were subjected to these extremes aren\u2019t well adjusted?", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter has committed a crime, but I don't think she's an asshole for the question at hand, which is deciding who gets custody.\n\nWhere you lose me specifically is describing her as a \"single mother by choice\". Like what are the high-earning tall good men just banging down her door and she's just like \"no I hate men (and women and NB) and I like being a poor\". \n\nAdditionally, your description of how you raised her is nothing short of \"we were absolutely perfect and she's just like some type of a demon, behold she's a single mother accused of a financial crime\".\n\nLet's also add cousin's mom trying to force cousin to foster a kid she doesn't want to, and you being TA for not forcing her to. \n\n\nCool story. As far as who has custody. If cousin doesn't want the kid, y'all need to tell the mom and ask her who she would like to have instead. If no one wants the kid, offer again. But don't use this as something you can hold over her head.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
