Sure it's just \"the weekends\", but maybe not, maybe you're always hurtful, maybe you use it as an excuse to be hurtful. \n\nStart by asking your wife if you can ask her some tough questions, ask her if she's happy, if she's okay with how much you drink, if you're mean to her when you're drunk, ask her if this one \"joke\" is the usual crap you pull when you're drunk to attack her but pretend it's a joke.", "Are you sure you're not struggling with sobriety?\n\nBecause that comment from your wife suggests that maybe you are, and maybe you aren't the best person to see it.\n\nAs for the comment: yes, YTA and you know you were doing it to get back at her.", "INFO: What outcome were you hoping for? Did you think Mrs Fly might say \"oh, you're right, thanks for pointing out my hypocrisy\"?", "OP got drunk as shit at his anniversary party, was starting to get that obnoxious drunk but think he\u2019s fine while everyone else is telling him to get some water and then thinks \u201cparroting\u201d is telling his wife not to get a rice krispy. LMAO just say you were drunk and wanted to get shit faced at your anniversary and was upset when your wife was annoyed by that. Don\u2019t make this about anything other than your drinking cause that seems to be the issue here \u2014> you getting drunk every Friday and thinking it\u2019s not annoying as fuck to be around", "There's a few things that would help context for this situation.  \n\nHow do you believe you act when you are drunk?  \nEven funny drunks or people who handle their alcohol well can get tiring after long enough. Even if you adore them.  \n\nThe other thing that is important is, how often do you drink? That doesn't have to be drinking until intoxication, just drinking alcohol in general.  \n\nReason I ask these two questions is that your behaviour and thought process leading up to the comment to your wife, along with your wife's comment, nake me suspect there might be more going on. \n\nWhen I get drunk, there's a lot of things I think of that I find really funny, that I might say to a friend. If my friend is also drunk, we usually both end up in hysterics because we are both in that intoxicated state so it lands similarly. But if my friend is sober, they're often going to understand that I found it funny (usually because I'm laughing) and remark that I'm drunk and maybe it's time to drink some water. Usually cause the thing I've said is profoundly stupid and/or not that funny.  \n\nIf you are someone who is exhausting to be around when you're drunk, then that can cause the exact response your wife had. Ever had to babysit someone who is smashed? It's usually not a fun time, no matter how fun of a drunk they are. Especially when you're sober.  \nSo if you tend to be impulsive, mean (even if you believe you're being funny), loud and generally less coherent, then seeing you already drunk but going for another drink could definitely illicit a \"really??\" response out of frustration.  \n\nIf your intoxicated self is like this *and* you drink frequently, then that will absolutely intensify the frustration.  \n\nYou mentioned that your wife hasn't ever mentioned your drinking being a problem, or your drunk behaviour being an issue, which could be true. But approaching that kind of conversation can also be very challenging, especially if you are not at all receptive to it, or justify your alcohol consumption before the issue has been brought up.  \n\nNow, I may be way off base with my speculations. But here's why I am inclined to think that the above might be going on.  \n\n>I was visibly intoxicated but decided to have another beer because that's just what I do on a Friday night.\n\nYou are already intoxicated, but decide to have another drink. This isn't a terrible thing to do, but the justification is what stood out to me- that this is just \"what I do\". Is this every Friday night/most Friday nights? And is this that you have a beer, or that you will \"have another\", regardless of your level of intoxication? They are two very different things.  \n\n>Upon seeing me retrieve this beer my wife says, \"Ugh, another one, fucking really?\" sounding all bent out of shape\n\nYou mentioned that when you \"parroted\" this back at her, it was in the same way that you both joke together, and used an example. But the way you've written this, it sounds like your wife was not saying this as a joke- \"sounding all bent out of shape\". This is also quite dismissive and condescending, to be honest.  \nSo whilst you frame your response as a \"parroting\" of her initial engagement and statement, you also justify that you were not being mean or hurtful, and engaging in a joke. But she wasn't. The very engagement you are parroting wasn't a joke. Yet you have parroted it back, as a joke, later on? I'll be honest, I don't buy it.  \n\n>This doesn't really bother me because i've been married to this super fly lady for 11 years now\n\n\"My wife made a comment about my drinking, which I dismissed, but it's fine cause I love her\". Then you have said here she has never spoken to you about your drinking being a problem, nor your drunken behaviour. Given that I believe her comment *was* an expression of frustration about your intoxication/drinking, one that seems quite strong emotionally, I am going to guess that there may have been other times she has in fact either tried to talk to you about your drinking/behaviour, and you have brushed it off.  \n\n>About 4 minutes later I see her getting a rice krispy treat so i jokingly say \"Ugh, another one?\" completely free of profanities or anything trying to show I'm just messing around because that's just my person.\n\nAgain, this is very different to the joke you used as an example of the humour you share with your wife.  \nAlso the justification of \"because that's just my person\" is not of any real substance.  \n\n>I'm now in the dog house and she's pissed because i was \"making fun of her weight\" and that \"getting a dessert is different than sobriety\"\n\nMany times you've said \"I don't think my wife has issues with her weight or with food\", saying that she isn't \"of a weight that my comment would be directed at her\".  \nYet she has said, to *you* directly, that you were making fun of her weight.  \nSo if she does struggle with weight issues (that does not only strictly mean she *physically* struggles with weight, it includes internal struggles), again, I don't believe you would be aware/would acknowledge them. Because she has said to you directly you made fun of her weight, showing you that clearly this is something that impacted her about this topic, and you have now continued to tell people \"no I don't think she struggles with weight issues, it doesn't effect her\".  \n\n>I tried to explain that it was \"not making fun of anyone's weight, just parroting someone getting +1 of something\" but it has fallen upon deaf ears\n\nSounds like your wife was expressing frustration about your alcohol use and how you behave due to your consumption of alcohol, and when you \"parroted\" her expression, she was upset. Which makes sense. Because it would have been received as \"you are consuming another dessert, which I am negatively responding to, because your excessive consumption results in an outcome I do not enjoy \". And the result of excess consumption of dessert is usually associated with weight.  \n\nSo to sum it up and be blunt;  \nI think you probably have behaviours that make you unpleasant and difficult to be around. One of those sounds like excessive alcohol consumption. Your wife probably has tried to bring this up, and you have either not realised, but more likely dismissed her as being \"bent out of shape\" because \"that's how you are\". Since she isn't being listened to, she probably just gave up trying to communicate with you about it, and had a moment of frustration where she made that comment.  \nYou, deciding that it was \"funny\", used her comment on her around food. Something that likely has been not unknown to you to be connected to a sensitive topic for her (weight/body image). I think you likely did this to get back at her for her initial comment. Not for a \"funny haha\", but more of a getting even.  \n\nYou even say what your wife does/doesn't struggle with, based on your own ideas, which completely contradict her actual words.  \n\nFor these reasons, I believe YTA here.", "YTA\n\nYou were parroting her specifically for the purpose of being an asshole. You knew it was annoying and not remotely constructive. You say you just want to keep doing things that make you laugh. So you just enjoy being annoying and you don\u2019t care about others, making you the asshole. You\u2019re extremely lucky your wife has put up with you for so long. Grow up and apologize. \n\nAlso commenting on someone else\u2019s eating is absolutely different from commenting on how much they\u2019re drinking.", "YTA\n\nYou were visibly intoxicated, and had another drink. Her calling you on that means she probably is taking issue to how much you're drinking, especially if you are hosting. You retaliated with comment just because you thought it was funny and wanted to keep a joke going? But you didn't find it funny and wanted to get back at her?", "Esh, you're both childish and she shouldn't dish out if she can't handle it.", "YTA- \nSo you was getting sloppy drunk and she made a comment you in return called her fat.", "YTA, and you will always be in these situations. Instead of handling yourself like an adult who\u2019s been married for 11 years, you decided to be a five year old and hit your wife with a clear insecurity. Mockery is never to give you the high road in any situation.", "YTA Dude she has a point like getting another drink and getting a desert are two different vastly different things. I can see where you come from but you might want to apologise for targeting your wife\u2019s insecurity in the open like that and maybe once she\u2019s cooled down you can offer your perspective", "You made me hungry for Rice Krispy Treats. How fortuitous that I happen to have some in my pantry! How unfortunate that I can never stop at just one or two or ten.\n\nBut to respond to your question \u2026\u2026..\n\nShe could see that you were visibly intoxicated, so she said something. Parroting back her comment indicates that you could see that she is visibly overweight, that\u2019s why you said something. Do you now understand why YTA?", "ESH. If she has a problem with your drinking she should address it when you\u2019re both sober and tell you where she\u2019s coming from. You also should tell her what she should/shouldn\u2019t eat even as a joke. As someone who previously had an ED it can be toxic and cause more harm than you realize (even if you didn\u2019t mean it). You\u2019re adults please just communicate", "\u201cI got sloppy drunk at my own wedding anniversary party that I was nominally hosting and when my wife got annoyed about it I decided to take a dig at her for eating dessert rather than take responsibility for my drinking.

I\u2019ve been in her shoes and said something similar quite a few times, after years of trying to gently encourage my spouse to put down yet another drink.\n\nI can guarantee that if it\u2019s not the first time, that she\u2019s tired of you drinking to excess. Your drinking directly affects her, especially if you tend to \u201cmess around\u201d when you\u2019ve been drinking more. The issue here may be as much about her being tired of your drinking as it is about you making a poor joke about having an extra treat (which does not actually affect you in any way.).", "YTA - you were already drunk and getting another beer and this sounds like it\u2019s a regular occurrence.

In her case, it wasn't the time and place for that conversation and in you made the comment to be an ass.", "ESH.

And you, because being petty and \"parroting\" her for fun to mock her about food is childish, and if you haven't sobered up enough to realize that you embarrassed and belittled her then you probably do have a problem with alcohol. \n\nI have been known to overindulge at social gatherings and my spouse pulls me aside to let me know when I'm approaching obnoxious territory. It doesn't happen often, but I'm glad I've got a partner that respects me and looks out for me, and I do the same when it's my turn to be DD.", "YBA.

About 4 minutes later I see her getting a rice krispy treat so i jokingly say \"Ugh, another one?\" completely free of profanities or anything trying to show I'm just messing around because that's just my person.\n\nI'm now in the dog house and she's pissed because i was \"making fun of her weight\" and that \"getting a dessert is different than sobriety\" and I tried to explain that it was \"not making fun of anyone's weight, just parroting someone getting +1 of something\" but it has fallen upon deaf ears and I have been asshole branded in our house. It should be noted that I am not struggling with sobriety or any other such issues, I just hear and see things that make me laugh and I want to keep it going. \n\nAITA for parroting my wife?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And then there\u2019s a thing called the boys club, which allows men to be a high positions excluding women so they can be free to be even more disgusting. \n\nAnd don\u2019t get me started on how society harps on little girls bodies at a very young age all the way until we\u2019re old. How we are meant to snap back into shape the minute we step outside of a hospital after giving birth. How men leave us because they no longer like our bodies after we\u2019ve destroyed it for their children.\n\nI\u2019m not saying men don\u2019t have body ideals, but they\u2019re more for earth other, then to attract women. Women are more prone to enjoy \u201cdad bodies\u201d than gym bodies. Look at every tv show that shows a chubby man with a fit wife.", "The circumstances are the same. People who drink too much ruin occasions for others.", "If they are really drunk, I will become uncomfortable and I will mention it or leave. It\u2019s not hard to tell when someone\u2019s too drunk and people get cut off from drinking at pubs and even denied entry for being too intoxicated so it\u2019s not this crazy concept that\u2019s unheard of", "Do you actually think it's normal to get  visibly drunk?", "a good friend. also anyone working at a bar is allowed to cut you off if you're hammered. so you don't have some mystical right to drink as much as you want ignoring your friends and the bar man.", "have you ever had to clean up someone\u2019s puke because they drank too much?? it\u2019s completely normal to watch out for those around you and raise concerns about their intoxication level because it effects everyone else too, not just them", "They\u2019re someone who has to deal with the drunk person. And maybe wants to protect them from literally hurting themselves or others.", "Hahahah they do and then they start brigading and throwing feces", "I think personally we are going to have to agree to disagree on this. I agree the women and girls are held to expectations that are both unrealistic and unfeasible, but I think men are as well. If you wish to disagree with me feel free.", "I honestly cannot believe you actually need to explain this to somebody. The fact that anyone thinks it is normal to get visibly drunk at a party or any public event is really something. I'd like to add that I come from a culture that very much normalizes drinking. But you're expected to know how to handle your alcohol. Getting publicly drunk is considered an embarrassment.", "It is if you are a friend. You are not a pub or an establishment serving someone, people really think they can tell people what to do.", "In you home is not in the bar. A friend sitting there judging your drinking is wild, the fact people think it is ok is crazy to me. Policing everyone\u2019s actions and thinking you are entitled to tell them what to do because you don\u2019t like it is ridiculous.", "HAHAHAHAHHA crazy Redditors \ud83d\ude44", "Yes because people being overly intoxicated affects the people around them. I will tell someone if and how they\u2019re making me uncomfortable whether drunk or sober. Why am I going to let a drunk person ruin my night? Fuck them for not knowing their limit", "its absolutely not wild. getting shitfaced in company is incredibly rude. and if you're a drunk that can't behave ots absolutely up to your friends to stop you from humiliating yourself or causing a scene. have you never been out with a bad drunk? or around one? the second they get to that point it ruins the night for everyone else who has to now babysit this person till they sober up. I've had entire nights ruined because of this. and good friends stop their friends from getting to that point.\n\nedit: there is a social contract when you are drinking with others, be it a friend or a partner, that you keep an eye on each other and make sure each other are safe and not doing something dangerous. this post heavily implies OP was a drunk idiot, its 100 percent his partners place to criticise them for it."]}
