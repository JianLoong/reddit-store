I will die on that hill.\n\nSecond, Cody has some kind of issues.  The snooping, breaking into a locked drawer, and entitlement/audacity to scream at you are already enough to pass that judgment.  Not even going to touch on that you could have those items without the creatures having been killed, or that he obviously knows you eat meat anyway and didn't call you names upon stepping in your house.\n\nUnfortunately because of causality, it was not possible for you to raise your family with manners.

Everybody else is though. \n\nFirst, the most snooping people generally do is peaking in medicine cabinets, and they keep their mouth shut since they tend to be asshats and gossips, and they tend not to directly confront people.

Having never done it myself I can't 100 percent attest to that being the motive, but observation indicates it is. \n\nSecond, this Cody yoyo has serious issues, is very rude, and needs to stuff it. Ridiculous behavior. And the rest of your family is just as bad enabling this nonsense. \n\nYou were a great host. You went out of your way to cook what sounds like a very good meal.

I'm appalled at this behaviour!", "NTA and I would ask them why he was really in your room because it is NOT normal and my first thought would be that he was trying to find some expensive stuff to steal.
