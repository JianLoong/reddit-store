I will die on that hill.\n\nSecond, Cody has some kind of issues.  The snooping, breaking into a locked drawer, and entitlement/audacity to scream at you are already enough to pass that judgment.  Not even going to touch on that you could have those items without the creatures having been killed, or that he obviously knows you eat meat anyway and didn't call you names upon stepping in your house.\n\nUnfortunately because of causality, it was not possible for you to raise your family with manners.

Everybody else is though. \n\nFirst, the most snooping people generally do is peaking in medicine cabinets, and they keep their mouth shut since they tend to be asshats and gossips, and they tend not to directly confront people.

Ridiculous behavior. And the rest of your family is just as bad enabling this nonsense. \n\nYou were a great host. You went out of your way to cook what sounds like a very good meal.

I'm appalled at this behaviour!", "NTA and I would ask them why he was really in your room because it is NOT normal and my first thought would be that he was trying to find some expensive stuff to steal.

We can accept their gayness while also rejecting their *absolutely bugfuck inappropriate\" behavior. Cmon mom, walk and chew gum here.", "OP check your valuables. This is abnormal behaviour and I am wondering what Cody was really looking for. \n\nIf his behaviour was so usual, your mother would not have thought to search for him. \n\nThey are covering up something. Think about whether anything is out of place.", "Nobody should accept Cody.  He is a creep and a very weird dude.", "You didn't ruin it, rude houseguests did.", "Why didn't she arrange it at her house then? I have a feeling your step father maybe the reason why she didn't.", "You didn\u2019t ruin anything you are NTA here, everyone else is.\n\nit\u2019s not normal to snoop, it\u2019s rude and abusive to enter someone s bedroom without permission.  you should seriously consider going no contact with your family, especially your stepfather and brother.", "Maybe she shouldn't accept Cody, since he apparently thinks it's ok to snoop through the host's bedroom and try to vandalise their things.", "No , fook them, Sam is an asshole and so is Cody, what asshole is in a woman's room opening drawers???? \nYou snoop you deserve whatever you find and that's some really weird shyt. Why is he in your drawers, he looking for a pair of panties to try on, need some of your Lube???\nStand your ground and put them all in their place. They violated your rights, they visiting and should only be in the living room or bathroom.  Fook acceptance, you been violated.", "On top of not being crazy; you where also violated on a huge level. Further to that it\u2019s absurd for anyone to expect just because you have a vegan guest (who you where extremely kind and accommodating too with your cooking) you should remove all trace of dead animals or animal products from the house. Did they expect you to clear the cupboards of all animal based foods?! If not why should your bedroom differ?! Did everyone make sure not to wear leather shoes or belts? If you happened to have a leather couch or chairs should you all have sat in the floor? This huge outburst is clearly to cover for the reasons this weird guy was in your room in the first place!!", "I\u2019m sorry OP I cannot get over how disrespectful everyone was to you. Especially your step dad. What did he mean someone like that\u2026 and how dare Cody go into your room?!", "Yeah kinda sounds like your family as a whole aren't quite in line with general society on this topic.\n\nTbf, we're all a bit nosy, and might have a little pry here and there, but even if you do and find something, you sure as hell don't mention it as you were the one prying in the first place!\n\nAlso, how extreme must his vegan ethics be, I've dated two vegans and neither had issues with things like found starfish, shells. One of then even liked found skulls and such as long as they weren't farmed.\n\nGetting that angry over some little trinkets is weird", "I HAVE peeked in a medicine cabinet or two in my life, mainly when I was young and dumb. It IS rude, but you do kind of expect that rude people who have to use your bathroom might poke around. But this was a bedroom! No one should expect that! Let alone trying to break your things!!!", "Your mom is a terrible guest. She sounds like the type who steals/pockets lose change she sees because \"if they wanted it, they would have put it away safely\".\n\nJust low-level thieving.\\\\Someone who invites you over does NOT consent to being spied on. Keep this in mind as you get into relationships, she's going to rifle through your things if you don't set strong boundaries with consequences for her. \n\nGoing through people's stuff AND being open and proud of it? Your mother is sooo wrong and weird/creepy.", "Your mom is wrong (or maybe just trying to justify her own snooping at other peoples houses). \n\nI am with my husband for 20+ years and spent a lot of time at my in laws house during those years. On more than one occasion totally alone except for my sleeping child. And guess what. There are still rooms in that house I never entered (their bedroom and FIL office) because I have no business being in there. \n\nWe moved houses a while ago and of course people visiting us are curious of how the house looks like. So they ask us to give them a tour instead of just wandering around on their own. Normally people even ask our daughter (9) if she feels comfortable to show her room or not instead of us because even a child deserves to decide who enters their room.\n\nCody had no right to enter your room (or any other room at your house you didn\u2019t invite him to use) and your family is acting ridiculously and entitled. Hope they will come to their senses soon and apologise.\n\nNTA", "But even by her logic, this was more than just the bathroom cabinets. He went into your bedroooooom. That\u2019s weird and invasive and inappropriate. God. I thought he found an octo-sided dildo by the way he acted.", "I had to go back and check because I thought I had missed that a child was also at the meal.", "No! Nobody does this!\n\nIt's weird behaviour and I cannot believe that you are being blamed for this.\n\nBuy your mum a vegan cookbook and don't allow that bizarre person back in your house.", "This is not normal. I can't believe you were called creepy in this situation \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f No, someone snooping through your room is creepy. Someone defending the person who snooped is creepy. Someone who tries to excuse snooping by thinking its normal, is f'ing creepy.", "NTA , it is one thing to look around the toilet and another thing to go in another room and search in it and especially a bedroom.", "Medicine cabinet? Really? It\u2019s a matter of medical secrecy. NTA all around.", "Omg no. I feel like I\u2019m overstepping when I\u2019m looking in a bathroom closet / under the sink for more TP or hand soap. Your mom is wrong, your step dad is rude, and Sam and his partner Cody..no words lol", "Your mother is telling you she goes through all your stuff.", "No, they don't. Why would they want to know what kind of medicine you take? Or are they looking for anything that will get them high? Does your mom have a lot of friends with drug habits?\n\nNormal people don't do that.", "What is normal that you give people tour of your home - not that they help themselves. Wtf if wrong with people. I'm sorry that you tried so hard OP and all you've got in return was this incredible rudeness.", "That doesn't speak well for her character.", "That's creepy.  \n\nIt also means your mother does that.  People generally assume their behaviour is normal.  If you don't do it, the thought never crosses your mind, and it is not brought up.", "I know zero people with locks that work outside their bedrooms. NONE.", "I wouldn\u2019t let any of them back without massive apologies and a sit down to explain boundaries and how to respect them in someone else\u2019s home.", "He tried to break in to your bedside table. If he wasn't robbing you then even worse he knows that's where personal items are kept and tried to do this his first Time in your house.", "I wouldn't be surprised if he was hoping to find your grandma's old meds, or something he could sell to get drugs. Honestly, this is addict behavior - and if your brother was looking through your grandma's room while his boyfriend was in yours... I think they might both be addicts. \n\nI would honestly be very concerned.", "I think it\u2019s likely, but either way, do what they said and get angry. Go on the attack, don\u2019t be defensive. People like your family tend to cow-tow to whoever is making the biggest stink.\n\nWhat he did was super fucking weird, whatever the reason behind it. So start ranting and raving about what an invasive, violating creep he is. Wax poetic about how ungrateful he was after you spent so much time and effort making him vegan food. \n\nMake yourself scary and angry enough that they\u2019re more scared of not siding with you.", "Yes, they may have been trying to take something. Do they perceive you as \u201crich\u201d for inheriting the house? Do they think Grandma left you a pile of gold? They seem jealous and entitled to your things. Did they even say thanks for the lovely dinner you made? Life\u2019s too short to waste on people like this.", "Lol please show your mother this post where everyone is saying it Is not normal!!! She been watching too much come dine with me or something?\n\nNTA 100% seems like it's just easier for them to blame you than the weird vegan tantrum. Good lord.", "OMG! Do not let these people back in your house! They were casing it or something! NTA", "The only other bit missing is that as a vegan he has no reason to question the remains either. \n\nDoes he think you grew the starfish in captivity and murdered it yourself? The same for the shark etc?\n\nThey are clearly the result of beach combing at at worst he can accuse you to of making 'art' out of animal remains, but since it was in the privacy of your bedroom you can hardly be accused of shoving it in his face, and I doubt he had the same reaction the other 100s of non vegan items that they brought with them or used over the course of their visit.", "Could also be a way for him to force Sam to cut ties. She keeps dead animals, therefore you can't speak with her.\n\nEither way, complete red flags from this guy.", "It doesn't make sense because Cody's reaction is completely nonsensical.  Even if he was upset by the sight of the bones, shells, and seahorse, to so quickly work himself into such a state that he's hurling insults at you and trying to break the table is so odd as to make me suspect one of two scenarios:\n\n1) There was something in the table he was trying to steal (are any of the objects in it metal, something that looks expensive even if it isn't?), got caught by your mom, and made a scene about the bones and shells to distract from his actions;\n\n2) I'm afraid this is the most likely, he planned the distraction ahead of time with your half-brother, as a distraction while your half-brother rummaged through your grandmother's room for valuables or medications.  It's completely nonsensical that they would leave the table and scatter to different private rooms of the house knowing that dessert is quickly going to be served.  If you have ever mentioned to your family that you don't go into/look into your grandmother's room and/or that you have left the room as it was, that could give him the impression that it was an easy target for theft.  \n\nEither scenario also offers some explanation for your mother's comment.  It's likely your half-brother or his boyfriend have stolen from her home in the past, and she's rationalized that it's her fault for not locking up/that it's something \"everyone\" does rather than confront her son's actions. \n\nI'm so sorry for the loss of your grandmother.  I hope her memory and home someday brings you more joy and comfort than sorrow.", ">I have never entered their bedroom. \n\nWhen I was 5 or 6 we were at my cousin's house. I was In her bedroom with them (they are slightly younger). Suddenly they left and closed the door and I was in there alone.\n\nI, no word of a lie, hid behind that door for 3+ hours while everyone was frantic. I could hear them getting more uptight and talking about maybe I'd walked back to the burger chain a few km away (the area wasn't as built up as it is now, lots of paddocks) and they were about to call the police.\n\n\nI still.dont know why I did that.\n\n\nAll this to say, OP is NTA", "Yeah, and you focus on your period product/toilet paper/ the wine glass you're trying to find or whatevs.  \n\n\nEven if you encounter the biggest Sledgehammer 5000 dildo and their scented lube collection in your legit hunt, you don't haul those suckers out and start waving them around and screeching about it. You just liberate the loo roll and get t.f on with being a decent guest.", "This is why I don't invite people into my home.", "That comment from the stepdad is so insulting. I'd want an explanation on what he meant by that before I'd be talking to them again.", "OP has one. It's on the front door.", "She already has a lock on the front door. She shouldn\u2019t let any of these AH\u2019s in her house again.", "Comment stolen from: /u/theholidayarmadillo3 \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106bih8/aita_for_not_locking_my_bedroom_door/j3fqnif/\n\nBot Reported.", "Well\u2026there was that lady (gf of a OP\u2019s bro I think) who waved around period products and screamed and complained because what if her son sees it.", "I would ask Sam if he was looking for stuff to steal, only thieves go thru drawers of someone's house.\nAnd you best believe some of these people are very unhinged,  Cody and Sam breaking up soon after just watch. Thief.", "NTA. Your family seems to be far more supportive of your bro than you. Bro should see their partners behavior as a gigantic red flag.", "Honestly I think most people would have a much harder time adjusting to a vegan in the family than having a gay couple in the family. You don't actually have to make any accommodations for a same sex couple unless not being a bigot counts. But accommodating a vegan can be a pain.", "Ooo please please please do this !!!", "Ding, ding, we have a winner!", "Remove all the door handles in your house and use stick on dildos instead.\n\nUse one that cums for the bedroom door.", "I'm vegan, and I don't think this is weird, or wrong of her to have. I have a bunch of sea things in my room, including four starfish exo-skeletons.\n\nCody shouldn't have gone into your room, OP. And him making a big deal seems like he was trying to deflect from the real reason they were in there. \n\nNTA.", "I was going to say that nobody eats sand dollars and seahorses, but apparently people do. Mostly in Asia,  but even there it's not common. I think this is a killing baby animals thing,  which is bizarre,  because the chance that the furniture maker searched for live sea creatures and killed them for art are pretty low also. Taking things found in nature and turning them into art is a good thing.  That vegan needs to get the sick out of his arse and look at this rationally as well as never invading your privacy ever again.", "But only during dinner parties, remember?", "Still the question is valid. \n\nIf I were your mom I would maybe have asked you to cook but not to host. I mean the alternative would have been that your mom asks you to come over to her house and help her cooking or do the cooking alone but just in her house. That way not all the work were on you with cleaning before the event and setting the table and stuff. \n\nIs there a valid reason not to do it that way? \n\nFrom my perspective its like your mom chose the easiest way. So she needn't cook and has no mess in her house and so. \n\nWhat I want to say is she asked for a big favor from you. Guest behaves badly and in part its your moms responsibilty because in reality its her guest more than yours. And instead of saying she is sorry for the mess she sort of insults you. \n\nDid they even say thank you that you hosted and did the cooking? Did you pay for the whole thing I mean pay for the food or did your mom contribute to it? Groceries (especially if you cook freshly) are not cheap usually. \n\nThe menu sounds delicious btw. Next time find yourselfs guests who value that and if only by behaving like decent people.", "Right. They\u2019re acting like she had a picture in the room of her harpooning the damn seahorse! \u201cThose creatures died of natural causes!\u201d", "Yep he was upset over literal beach debris. \n\nI'm sure next he's going to have a fit that she moved a piece of driftwood into her home.", "Gonna have to steal that line from you, it made me laugh. \u201cImpressive level of terrible\u201d", "Lol. He should see my altar! I have couple of birds wings, bones from a reindeer spine, a dragonfly and a mummy of a common lizard among other things.\nAll things I've found and are there because of my respect. I would go berserk if anyone would even touch them without asking me first. \nI know there are snoops that will peek in places they shouldn't but touching anything.. that's just so wrong. If a door is shut. And what maniac starts to destroy other peoples stuff?", "It\u2019s not like you were doing weitd stuff with a cat carcass or something, those dead animal parts are just beach stuff. The guy seems oddly sensitve.", "Coastal California here, as well. It's so normal to have beachcombing finds around the house here that it took me a few minutes to figure out what Cody was claiming to be upset about it.\n\nDoes he also freak out at the beach? \n\nNTA, he was freaking out because he got caught breaking into stuff and trying to steal something.\n\nIf your 'family' press you on this,  ask what he was trying to find and what Sam was looking for in Grandma's room.\n\nThey waited for you to be busy and made beelines to two specific spots in your house. They had a plan.\n\nThey were looking for stuff to take.\n\nMy guess is Cody damaged something trying to break something open and the drama was to distract from that."]}
