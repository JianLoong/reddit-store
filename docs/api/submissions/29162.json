(We have been together for two years). They are so sweet and treat me with so much respect and we have a great relationship. But, one thing I don\u2019t really like is how they take advantage of his finances. He still lives at home but he pays his own bills (car, phone, insurance), and pays rent and the utilities bill for the house. On top of that, his parents will ask to \u201cborrow\u201d money but they never end up paying him back and he is okay with it. He lives paycheck to paycheck. \n\nThe other day my boyfriend, male 22, told me, female 22, that his parents want him to co-sign a 70,000 loan. He told me that they wanted it to help pay off other loans and do some work on the house. He has the best credit score and makes the most in his family, meanwhile his parents don\u2019t make very much and have bad credit from previous loans. He got mad when I told him that that was effing crazy and that he shouldn\u2019t do it. I told him that he can\u2019t be attached to that kind of financial commitment when he has no savings or foundation for himself. We got into more of an argument about it and he called me an asshole for not wanting him to help his family. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want him to help his family, it\u2019s just that he is so young and doesn\u2019t have any financial stability to make a commitment like that. I don\u2019t know what to do because he is such a sweet guy and would sacrifice anything for the people he loves. I just don\u2019t want him to end up with so much debt and ruin his future financially. \n\nAny advice?", "created_utc": 1697607405, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17aj7fo/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_not_cosign_a/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Fuck that\nNTA\nThis is one of those things that he\u2019s gotta figure out on his own. \nMy only advice is consider how this familial selflessness will impact you as you continue to build a life together.", "NTA, if his parents have a bad history of loans and their credit score are low, then obviously he should not even touch that paper. What he SHOULD do is help his parent get in touch with someone to help them on credit issues and that's about it. And given he is paycheck to paycheck, how much is that ARP? Monthly bill to pay? Those loan sharks are no joke.", "NTA. Lets look at numbers: His family probably has all intentions of paying this load back, but their history says otherwise. A $70,000 loan is around $100,000 in debt with interest (or more), and an $800/month payment he would be responsible for if they stopped paying it. If he can't make that payment, his credit would be scorched. \n\nOnce he defaults on that loan (and it would be HIS loan, and HIS responsibility), his credit is going to be screwed for a LONG time. He's 22? Figure a minimum of 10 years. All the things he is already on track to do, like easily buy a car, get credit cards, rent apartments, etc, will suddenly become so much more difficult, if not impossible. Any credit he does get, will be at the highest end of interest, meaning a car loan that might have been $300/month is now $450/month. \n\nYou see where I am going here? His family got into this mess, and they can figure a way out of it without him being involved. This could literally be the deal breaker in his adult life. He needs to look at his own future. Period.", "If his parents didn't pay their old loans off, why on earth does he think they're going to pay this one?? Imo you're not going to be able to stop him co-signing- he's obviously conditioned to give them money whenever they ask- but I'd have serious second thoughts about commiting to him legally in any way.

One of my closest friends is literally stuck with enormous debt that his parents tricked him into assuming financial responsibility for on their behalf. I don't know your partner's relationship well enough at all to advise if a genuine assist can be made here, but the idea that a parent would knowingly do something so financially irresponsible, that if they fail they jeopardize their child's future... It just reads to me as though they would make no reservations to let their son take the fall for them. I can already see the justifications being made when the music stops because \"he makes the most\" or something.\n\nI admit the number alone is giving me sticker shock and that's primarily why I call it irresponsible.", "Co-signing ANYTHING for family/friends is a very bad idea.

There's no point in trying to discuss how this is going to affect his credit score, figuring out a budget, talking about how is he going to affect him if his parents default on the loan, etc.  You said he's living paycheck to paycheck, and just like anyone who is a substance abuser, unless they ask for help, there's nothing anyone can do to help.

Your bf sounds like the kind of guy who enables his family without limits. If you force him to drop them, he's going to resent you and relationship is dead anyways.

Don't stick around when shit hits the fan.", "NTA....   the trap is set and he is walking into it voluntarily.. good to be loyal to the family but.......", "NTA, run. He is not going to learn except painfully and he will take you with him. His parents cannot afford the loan so he will get stuck paying it, and he cannot afford that either. It is not going to be a good start to your life or to his if things go south.", "NTA \n\nThat\u2019s freaking crazy.

So he\u2019s not so much as helping them, but he\u2019s gonna be paying back a 70k loan on his own. Of money he\u2019s not even going to see. If his parents can\u2019t afford to pay for it themselves then they shouldn\u2019t get the loan. \n\nAsk him, what about your future together?
