Every second he\u2019s awake he needs someone around him, unless he\u2019s watching cartoons. You can\u2019t even have a conversation around him because he starts screaming to get attention. He wasn\u2019t neglected as a child, he\u2019s just like this. \n\nBecause of that he still needs someone to watch him when falling asleep. It\u2019s a difficult process, because he constantly tries to get out of bed and run around the house and refuses to cooperate. The whole process takes usually 2/3 hours to get him to fall asleep. He also often at that time starts arguing that he\u2019s hungry, because he usually refuses to eat dinner with us.\n\nSo today I got hungry and wanted to grab a quick snack. At the time I went to the kitchen, he was still watching cartoons, but minutes after that my dad and him moved to his bedroom. He didn\u2019t even notice me in the kitchen then, but my dad snuck up on me to scare me, while I was cutting food. I jokingly said that I\u2019m going to stab him (with the knife I was holding) next time he does this and my brother probably heard me and figured I was making some food. \n\nFew minutes after that he starts whining that he wants to eat, my dad says no, because literally half an hour before he was proposing him some food but he didn\u2019t want it. He started crying that he\u2019s going to starve and my dad gave up and went to the kitchen to grab some cereal and he yelled at me that next time I should wait till he\u2019s asleep (even though I\u2019d probably need to wait until 11 pm).\n\nI think it\u2019s ridiculous that I should wait few hours, no matter if I\u2019m hungry or thirsty, just to enter the kitchen, especially that my brother pulls this stunts even when no one is in the kitchen at that time. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1678652186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11polaw/aita_for_eating_when_my_brother_was_going_to_bed/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s great that they have so much patience for him, but it sounds like that means your dad at least is redirecting his frustration towards you. It\u2019s one thing for them to accommodate his needs, it\u2019s another for them to not set appropriate boundaries and expectations.\n\nThey might need some extra support so they can give him the kind of help and guidance he needs.

Mainly a stricter bedtime routine, and occasionally telling him no when he wants something. \n\nHaving a family member with mental illness doesn\u2019t mean submitting to abuse. Plus, part of living with an illness is learning to deal with it in a way that doesn\u2019t inconvenience other people.

We were supposed to all go, so a professional would tell us how to work with him, but I don\u2019t know what happened with that.", "Yeah, dad was totally fine with him making food at first. It was only after little brother pitched a fit that dad had a problem.\n\nIt's not your fault that you're in this situation, and it took years of begging according to one of your comments to get him diagnosed. Your parents not only weren't prepared to have a child with autism(though who is?), it shouldn't have taken years of begging them to figure out that maybe something was wrong. Even if he was neurotypical they should have went to a child therapist to figure out why he was constantly acting out to get his way.\n\nParents seem like they don't really consider children as people with their own thoughts and feelings, but rather as something that needs to be controlled and obedient. That's not a very good way to feel as a parent IMO\n\nOP NTA", "That's the most ridculous thing I have ever heard.\n\nAs a person, they want to eat when they are hungry.

OP is not the parent", "it was 8:30 pm, he wasn\u2019t even going straight to bed, but to play for some additional 40 minutes before actually going to bed. I can\u2019t really plan accordingly, I\u2019m in college rn and have a lot of additional lectures besides that, my schedule is completely unpredictable.", "What? Kids need to eat when they\u2019re hungry. Eating that late is literally bad for you; it spikes your glycemic index right before you sleep. As parents they should be providing a healthy environment for both kids. Not focussing on one at the expense of the other. Is it hard? Absolutely. But when you choose to have kids, that sort of situation becomes their responsibility to navigate. Not OP\u2019s. NTA OP.\n\nEdit: i have two siblings on the spectrum and my parents handle it well. It can be done.", "There are a lot of services available including Behavioral Therapists.

You have to accept that.\n\nNo.  No, you don't just 'have to accept that'.

This isn\u2019t a one time situation, not only specifically kitchen one, but in general, when they or I struggle with taking care of my brother, it\u2019s never his fault, it\u2019s always me that supposedly messes up, sometimes straight up by exiting in the same house as him. \n\nI might be the AH in this specific situation, but it\u2019s a wild assumption that my parents might stop blaming me for my brother misbehaving if I\u2019m just \u201ccareful enough\u201d"]}
