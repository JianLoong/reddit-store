He wasn\u2019t neglected as a child, he\u2019s just like this. \n\nBecause of that he still needs someone to watch him when falling asleep. It\u2019s a difficult process, because he constantly tries to get out of bed and run around the house and refuses to cooperate. The whole process takes usually 2/3 hours to get him to fall asleep. He also often at that time starts arguing that he\u2019s hungry, because he usually refuses to eat dinner with us.\n\nSo today I got hungry and wanted to grab a quick snack. At the time I went to the kitchen, he was still watching cartoons, but minutes after that my dad and him moved to his bedroom. He didn\u2019t even notice me in the kitchen then, but my dad snuck up on me to scare me, while I was cutting food. I jokingly said that I\u2019m going to stab him (with the knife I was holding) next time he does this and my brother probably heard me and figured I was making some food. \n\nFew minutes after that he starts whining that he wants to eat, my dad says no, because literally half an hour before he was proposing him some food but he didn\u2019t want it.

It was only after little brother pitched a fit that dad had a problem.\n\nIt's not your fault that you're in this situation, and it took years of begging according to one of your comments to get him diagnosed. Your parents not only weren't prepared to have a child with autism(though who is?), it shouldn't have taken years of begging them to figure out that maybe something was wrong. Even if he was neurotypical they should have went to a child therapist to figure out why he was constantly acting out to get his way.\n\nParents seem like they don't really consider children as people with their own thoughts and feelings, but rather as something that needs to be controlled and obedient.

I\u2019m reading this at 1 am and now you got me hungry.", "NTA. Sounds like the kid has high-functioning autism. As someone who has the same thing but is now older, I want to share my piece with you, even if it is off topic.\n\nLike your brother, I was a nightmare for my family. Constantly wanting attention and always making arguments out of nothing. I remember that I one time got upset that my grandmother turned on the shower for me, and when she shut it off so I could turn it on, I was still upset because I couldn\u2019t turn it on originally. Yeah, there was no winning with me. Most doctors told my parents that I would never be able to live away from them and told them to medicate me.\n\nLuckily, they never did. I managed to graduate top of my class and was accepted to a T30 university. Completely able to live without my parents.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Because a lot of people see an autistic child and think they\u2019re hopeless. Your brother sounds like he is capable, but he has a developmental disability. If he can overcome it, it will become a superpower. It\u2019s going to take a lot of patience from your parents (and you!) as well as a lot of thought finding solutions. They will need to be flexible with him. Sometimes autistic children do actions that seem unreasonable but have logic behind them (for example I would scream in restaurants, turns out the noises bothered me so my parents bought me earplugs).\n\nAnd final piece, never medicate him. Some people may say \u201cwell obviously\u201d to this note, but my parents had doctors tell them to put me on some sort of anti-psychotic. The end result will be much better without.\n\nI wish you luck and hope you and your brother can become super close siblings.", "NTA\n\nYour Dad is taking his frustration out on you, which is ridiculous but very human of him. Do you think you can talk to him about that, during a less stressful time of the day?\n\nYou're not the parents, so to an extent what I'm going to tell you is pointless. This shit shouldn't be your problem, but at the moment it kind of is. Maybe you can get your parents to implement it, or some of it, maybe you can subtly do a bit of it yourself. \n\nI am in NO WAY suggesting that you take this upon yourself!!!\n\nAt the very least, your brother needs a much stricter routine, and it can't all be the way he wants it. \n\nThey can start with bedtime. If it takes 3 hours to put him to bed, they need to start that at 6pm at the latest. I'm not saying put him to bed at 6, but start the process. \n\nIf he's into books, at all, turn off the cartoons and get him involved with a book. Any kind. Comics. Whatever. Or he can be read to, if he's likely to sit still for long enough. \n\nWhat is he into? Trains? Dinosaurs? Wizards? Mythological Creatures? Vampires? \n\nIf he's clingy AF, instead of fighting it all day give him a set time focusing on him and his current subject of extreme interest. He's still going to be clingy and carry on when it's over, but after a while he'll understand that this was not the *last time ever* that he's got to sit and rattle on endlessly about Whatever It Is. That will make it easier for him to process that \"Whatever It Is\" time is over *now*, but he'll get to do it again tomorrow.\n\nThe key to it all is routine. The same shit, over and over and over. Get up at the same time, eat at the same time, brush teeth at the same time, get dressed at the same time, go to school ... etc etc etc.\n\nDoes your brother go to school, btw? Do you know how he does there?\n\nSame thing at the end of the day. Have a snack at the same time. Do whatever activities at the same time. Wash up for dinner at the same time. Eat dinner at the same time. TV for a set amount of time. Turn off the TV at the same time. Shower and pyjamas at the same time. Read a book at the same time. Off to bed at the same time.\n\nNGL it's fecking irritating for the other people in the house to get this kind of thing set up, and it's not a magic bullet. \n\nIt takes time for it to start to work, and there will be shitfits of epic proportions along the way. But there are shitfits of epic proportions already, so the family might as well deal with them in a way that means *eventually* things will run smoothly for the most part.\n\nAbout the eating. Sometimes being super sensitive to textures can be a huge issue for people with ASD. Whoever cooks usually is going to have to find out what the triggers are, and work around that.", "Melatonin works great too. My son, 7 ASD, won\u2019t go to bed without it. He stays up almost all night if he doesn\u2019t get any", "Same. Mine (5 ASD) would stay up until sometime between 11 pm and 2 am without it. Melatonin has been a sanity saver for us all.", "Yeah, nah. I responded NTA and I absolutely understand the situation.\n\nIf Dad didn't want the little one to know the older one was in the kitchen, Dad shouldn't have drawn attention to the fact that the older one was in the kitchen. \n\nIt also doesn't seem like Dad and Mum have established much of a routine for the little one, if their answer to the little one pitching fits is to allow him to get his own way.", "NTA. Why is he watching cartoons until 11pm? Why isn\u2019t there an evening snack ritual to be sure he can fall asleep? \n\nEven kids without autism need interventions like protein snacks in the evening and screens off by 6pm etc. your parents need to get help in how to support him.\n\nKids distracted by cartoons will not register hunger, hunger makes it impossible to sleep. Your dad is being a lazy AH.", "Just some words of comfort and advice, as a kid that grew up with ADHD before people really understood how neurodivergence works. \n\nThere's a lot of rules I just don't get and behavior I never learned how to engage with, and that impacts my day to day! If you know there's going to be exceptions to a previously established rule, you should set time aside to explain how and why, and set realistic expectations for when this exception will happen. Eventually exceptions become their own structured rules and your kid will start to build fortitude with new situations. I promise! Just like everything else, practice makes perfect.\n\nI wish my parents had socialized me more, because even though I've got resiliency for days, I am often confused with social situations others find simple. I just didn't get enough exposure to that stuff growing up. \n\nThe most important thing to remember is that she will grow out of stuff, and into stuff, and out of stuff, and into stuff - \n\nI grew out of and into bad habits my whole childhood. My parents handled this very badly, because they took every little change as something permanent. It's not. As I grew up I got better at self regulating. Setting my own routine helped immensely, because then I could decide what I ate, when I went to bed, ect. And boy did I suffer for a bit! I'm suffering right now, because I'm super bad at bedtime! But I still live a productive life where I regulate myself and don't live in filth and hold a job. She she probably will too! You're doing great!", "i meant that he wasn\u2019t neglected when he was younger/still a baby. English isn\u2019t my first language, so I wasn\u2019t sure how to say it", "Autistic kids need routines even more than other kids. If your parents have difficulty balancing that, then he's going to feel unbalanced and overwhelmed pretty much constantly. Kids don't understand they need routines, but they typically feel and act a lot better when they're completing them successfully.\n\n It's not your responsibility, I want to stress that, but establishing a concrete dinner and bedtime routine with him is going to save you hours of stress. If he's not eating with you guys there could be food sensitivities going on that require him eating a different diet, even if that's just Pedialyte and fiber supplements for weeks on end. What matters is that he's eating and functioning on a workable level, not that he's doing in the same way as everyone else.", "It also just DOES NOT work with autistic or ADHD kids. It just doesn't. We're literally wired differently and mentally can't respond in the same way as other kids. Routine, structure, and flexibility are the ways to raise a kid. Daytime routines for self regulation. Structure for mental stability. Flexibility to understand and work with the fact that your kid has different needs then you and needs to do things in their own way.", "Thank you!", "even if he has food sensitivities going on, we always propose him different food if he refuses to eat, usually some grilled cheese or scrambled eggs, because he likes them, but he\u2019s still refusing to eat :/", "He's unfortunately still in the life stage where he doesn't have the tools to explain why he's upset, only the ability to act on being upset. Building that toolset is another thing your parents should be working on with him. In the meantime, instead of saying \"what do you want\" or \"do you want something else? [List of options]\" you guys can say \"do you want [dinner] or do you want [safe food]?\". If he says no to both offer two more choices, like \"Do you want eggs or cereal.\" Be firm that he gets a choice, but does not get to disrupt the routine. In the long run this will help him self regulate when he starts dictating his own meals and schedule. \n\nLimiting choices cuts down on the overwhelming factor while still giving small doses of agency. Being firmer about dinner and bed routines, even if this means moving dinner by an hour to accommodate everyone, will also help a lot. But sending him to bed hungry really isn't helping anything and is going to hurt in the long run. It could be a sensory issue, it could simply be needing that small dose of control, but either way trying to enforce a routine when his needs aren't fully met is just going to Pavlov disdain for bedtime and make it progressively harder."]}
