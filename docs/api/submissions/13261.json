I have the answer! She can have her boyfriend move in and pay half!!!

Move all your valuables out now and get the rest of yourself out as soon as possible. Stop cooking together and if possible stop buying shared groceries. Keep it light and cheerful and ignore any tantrums. Don't accept judgement from an unreasonable person and don't expect an unreasonable person to see the light. If she threatens you tell her you'll trade a peaceful exit for not telling the landlord about her illegal tenant boyfriend- almost guaranteed that she's violating her lease.\n\nNTA", "NTA - see if you can move quicker.", "NTA Your roommate has issues that shouldn't be yours. If she so upset about living on her own perhaps her bf can move in officially and start PAYING his share. One month is ample notice. Let your  roommate cry and stomp her feet all she wants. Just move out and let her problems be her problems.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If the rental agreement is only a month's notice, then that is all you have to give. She agreed to it, and only now realizes she needs more time. But that is not your fault. She has bad planning skills.  She can go to craigslist and get a roommate. Full grown adults are only ever responsible for themselves."]}
