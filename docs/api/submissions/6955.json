All I wanted was to have dinner with you guys\u201d. Then, I actually lost the plot. It was a Saturday night, it was our anniversary dinner, we are going to their place tomorrow for Sunday Dinner.

Y\u2019all are spending wayy too much time with MIL. This is just insane. \n\nYou should not have to spend every waking second with this woman. You *should* be allowed to have an anniversary dinner with just the two of you without her having a panic attack over it. \n\nMIL is too involved. She\u2019s also crazy.\n\nBoundaries pls.

Why would you ruin your anniversary just to stop MIL from acting unhinged.\n\nI would take a few weeks off from your Sunday obligation.", "You need a new best friend.", "NTA. Not at all. She shouldn\u2019t have expected to get to go in the first place. Ridiculous. Tell your bestie to take her to dinner on her special occasions.", "NTA \n\nShe was being highly disrespectful and intrusive on YOUR anniversary. It wasn't her anniversary. She def needs boundaries written in stone!!\n\nTbh, I think you see her too often. She needs to have her own friends, hobbies and outside interests. She's clinging to her son and you too much. It's not healthy for her or you. This resentment on both sides will only continue to grow if something isn't done. Your partner needs to have a serious but gentle talk with her. Now.", "NTA. She shouldn't be inserting herself into an occasion that is meant for husband and wife only. Glad your husband agrees with you. NTA.", "Nta.  Ask her how could she do that to you two on your anniversary. A marriage is 2 people not husband, wife and mommy. What a pushy ahole she is.  Your anniversary.  Not hers. Time to sit her down put down some boundaries.  If she can't respect you, time to put some distance. Your best friend is wrong.  All this could have been avoided if mom would have understood no means no and shown some respect for the two of you.  If you would have allowed her to join your anniversary dinner who know what else she would have expected in the future. You were right to not include her. She's selfish and nuts.", "NTA. Her behavior is not normal.  She was upset because she couldn\u2019t manipulate either one of you to get her way", "Oh man, there's nothing worse than a meddling MIL! \n\nYou & your partners lives don't revolve around her and clearly she's upset by that. Is your partner the only male child perhaps? If so, we all know this story and it's not a good bedtime read. \n\nYou guys are already spending tons of time with her, and your anniversary or any other milestones,  things you want to celebrate have nothing to do with her and shouldn't include her if you don't want her included. \n\nMaybe you can cut back some time with her and put some boundaries in place. If she's a boundary stomping MIL, then I would keep putting up more boundaries and road blocks for her until she gets the point,  or until you decide on another avenue.  \n\nNTA", "NTA no is an a acceptable answer and she embarrassed herself by whining.  It was a night for you two alone. What is hard to understand? Is she lonely?", "NTA\n\nNothing say romance like your MIL.", "NTA \n\nYour MIL needs to learn what boundaries are. I mean for christ's sake, she's acting like a child. You guys need to lay down some boundaries with her.", "You and your partner are perfectly correct. This is your milestone and for many couples with busy lives an anniversary is an ideal setup for a date night. Parents are not welcome on date night.\n\nNTA\n\nYour MIL seems more than a little needy and for your relationship\u2019s sake your partner should have a discussion with her.", "NTA.\n\nYour mother in law needs learn how to respect boundaries.\n\nAlso Your friend needs to grow a pair. That was terrible advice.", "You are NTA. She had a tantrum didn' t she. You already see his mom plenty. Wanting to go with you on your anniversary dinner is just intrusive. Put her on a break and not see her for a wek or two. . I would mute her on your phone.", "NTA. It's an anniversary dinner for a relationship. Two people, not three. It's not like she never spends any time with the couple either.", "NTA and your best friend is utterly wrong. Anniversaries are for the couple, not the MIL.", "NTA. Husband needs to have a sit down and set some strong boundaries cuz she's not hearing the no.", "NTA. It's weird how invested MIL is in your anniversary dinner. It's not his birthday; it's yalls anniversary. It has nothing to do with her, and she sees you frequently.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL and your best friend are the AH's here, hands down. Your smother-in-law needs to learn bohndariws and your friend needs to understand there is nothing wrong with a loving couple sharing a meal together on their anniversary. In fact it would've been generally weird with the MIL present for the occasion as a third wheel. I'd understand if you both made fuss about it and invited a lot people to celebrate, but you didn't. It was a night for the two of you ruined by his mother's overreaching.", "NTA, hello /justNoMil\n\nAsk her if dinner would have been enough for her, or whether she also wanted to be invited to the couch snuggles, and following sexy time, too?", "NTA.  Your anniversary is for you and your partner.  You chose not to invite anyone else.   You see her very often during other times.  It sounds like your MiL is single--maybe you need to set her up on Tinder, Bumble or a different dating app, so that she will have less free time.", "NTA she has issues.", "No. NTA. You communicated to her that you wanted to have a date night with just the two of you for your anniversary and she couldn\u2019t accept it. That\u2019s a her problem.", "NTa\n\n\nI think it's time to stop the weekly dinners and taking her out for other meals.  She needs boundaries and to be honest I wouldn't have gone over the next day.\n\n\nYour best friend is essentially saying that you should allow your MIL to be the third party in your relationship, to allow her to overstep, so you don't hurt her feelings and make her upset.\n\n\nYou nor your partner are responsible for MILs needs, feelings or emotions.  If you took her with you, it sets a precedent that she should be included in all your anniversaries, then she will be expected to come on your honeymoon if you get married, be in the delivery room if you have a kid, have a say on where you live.  Where does it end?  \n\n\nHe needs to tell her that it's not appropriate for her to be included in his date nights or his anniversary.  That she is his mother and she needs to respect the boundaries of his relationship with you.\n\n\nDid he talk to her. And did you go Sunday?\n\n\nAlso it sounds like she relies on your partner to meet her emotional needs.  Like for her to feel that she should be included in this dinner, sounds like she feels like her son should be treating her Ike her husband does.  It's a thing.

Obviously NTA No. No amount of conversations is enough with this type of MIL.\n\nI know it sounds bad, but you stop going that much to her place and sharing that much because she is feeling entitled to be a part of your relationship. What if in the future you want to go to a romantic trip? Will she pull some weird shit? We don't know, but is better to prevent it.  \nIt's like you haven't cut that umbilical cord with her and your partner sounds like he is too much of a mama's boy as well.\n\nTry to distance yourself from her, but mainly your partner needs to put his boundaries otherwise... Good look with that rollercoaster of MIL you got.", "NTA. Anniversary dinners are a romantic date with only two people. His mom is way out of line and owes you an apology.

I didn't even know that was a thing, probably because it isn't.

Hell, you spend more time with your inlaws than I have with my parents since going off to college. \n\nNext time tell her that you two plan on dinner and mind blowing sex right afterwards, so her company would be a mood killer.", "NTA - this woman is crazy.", "NTA. Who takes their mother to their anniversary dinner? It's a night for romance. Your husband should tell MIL that you are both going NC until she aplogizes and promises not to pull this again.", "Nta! Its YOUR anniversary. Fuck your MIL. Why is she feeling entitled?", "I find it hard to believe YOUR best friend would tell you to bring your MIL on a romantic date.", "NTA, so you are establishing boundaries as a couple perfectly.

You and partner should be able to have an anniversary dinner DATE.  you do not bring your parents on a date\u2026?", "NTA. I bet your friend doesn't invite their parents to an anniversary dinner.
