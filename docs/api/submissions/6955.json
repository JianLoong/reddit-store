Your anniversary is for you and your partner.  You chose not to invite anyone else.   You see her very often during other times.

If you took her with you, it sets a precedent that she should be included in all your anniversaries, then she will be expected to come on your honeymoon if you get married, be in the delivery room if you have a kid, have a say on where you live.  Where does it end?  \n\n\nHe needs to tell her that it's not appropriate for her to be included in his date nights or his anniversary.  That she is his mother and she needs to respect the boundaries of his relationship with you.\n\n\nDid he talk to her. And did you go Sunday?\n\n\nAlso it sounds like she relies on your partner to meet her emotional needs.  Like for her to feel that she should be included in this dinner, sounds like she feels like her son should be treating her Ike her husband does.  It's a thing.

Thanks for your support! :-)", "More like psycho killer", "Agreed, this is total r/justnoMIL territory, you\u2019ll find lots of support and great ideas there.", "I watched the first season on White Lotus and this is so very similar to the MIL.showing up at their honeymoon lol", "That sub will ONLY attempt to completely destroy your relationships with everyone in this story. It used to be helpful but it is all pretty unhelpful now and turns the OP into the justno. It sounds like you and your partner have good boundaries and support each other. Keep that up!", "Don't check those subs out, half of the posters are narcissists themselves looking for validation while playing the victim when they are in fact the problem. \n\nYou come for the drama, to vent, you leave because you realise those subs are toxic and they try to get you to destroy all of the relationships in your life.", "Lol just date a man who hates his mother and hasn\u2019t seen her in over 15 years like mine! Life is good I promise", "That's also an option!", "I think if I even invited my parents to an anniversary dinner with my husband they would think *I* was crazy. Anniversaries are for the couple. Some milestone anniversaries people have parties, but that's also at the discretion of the couple.\n\nNTA", "Info\n\nIs your best friend a doormat?", "NTA and i assume your best friend is just a pushover in general, so their response make sense.", "NTA. The night was planned for two. MIL needs a life of her own.", "If you have kids with him she will be even worse. She will interfere with your parenting and demand that you visit more often. NTA", "NTA. I think it's time to start scaling back on the Sunday visits, too. Just my opinion.", "NTA You guys really need some distance from MIL. She already thinks of you as a throuple. How dare you celebrate your wedding anniversary without her!! Give yourselves some space and arrange some weekends away just the two of you. May God help you if you ever decide to have kids.", "Is your best friend just your mother in law in a mustache and trench coat? Because no real best friend would ever call you an a in this situation. NTA at all!!", "NTA. This is weird and  obsessive. Your friend is weird too", "NTA.  Who in their right mind would consider including MIL on their anniversary dinner?  Who in the world would ask to be included?\n\nKind of reminds me of Raj going with Sheldon and Amy (Big Bang Theory) on their anniversary dinner.\n\nTalk about inappropriate.  No was clearly the right answer here.  OP is right, her hubby needs to talk some sense in to his mother.", "Your best friend, unfortunately, is an asshole. \n\nAnniversary is YOUR (you two\u2019s) milestone. Asking to be invited (anywhere) is rude. Declining the rude request is not rude, it\u2019s healthy self-respecting boundary maintenance. \n\nYou? NTA", "ESH. \n\nYour relationship, your anniversary, your dinner, your call. She's imposing and that's not cool.\n\nThat said, maybe it wouldn't kill you to celebrate with her one time, since it is obviously important to her for God knows what reason, and then have your own thing later? You could have handled this a bit more gracefully, I'm saying.", "NTA of course. Way to go setting boundaries and having a united front with your partner. But is your best friend always this much of a pushover? Like holy cow if you are an AH over that small and generic boundary?? Is she ok?", "nta.  I am close with my mil and do you think she came with us for our anniversary dinner?  Actually,  she did but we INVITED them.  She needs to cool it.  You are very generous already with your time.", "NTA\n\nShould she also be invited on a second honeymoon. No, there are couple events and family events, and your anniversary is a couple event.\n\nIs she lonely, has she always been this involved with you as a couple?", "NTA - was she always like this or has she lost the plot recentlyt?  could his be an undiagnosed health problem?", "NTA - your husband needs to establish boundaries.  You spend to much time with her", "damn now ive got that song stuck in my head lol", "I love that song don\u2019t ruin it for me \ud83d\ude02", "Think boiled bunnies and \u201cI will not be IGNORED.\u201d   \ud83d\ude33"]}
