Breaking out of the indoctrination, not only of their religion but also the pressure to conform and to do what they want rather than what you want or what is right for you is incredibly hard, you may find it helpful to have professional support to help you to believe (as well as to know) that you are not doing anything wrong and that your parents and family are being unreasonable in trying to impose their belief systems on you.\n\nCarry on being strong for your son.
