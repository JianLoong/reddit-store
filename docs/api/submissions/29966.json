She responded by calling me inconsiderate and saying this is proof I don't care about her.\n\n3) You are correct shes an adult and can make her own food. You're not her personal chef,her mom, her caretaker, none of that.\n\nAll that being said, you didn't need to snap at her. Theres many ways to get a point across without needing to get upset. Could you be considerate in making some food for her? Sure, but its not like she done the same for you from what you've stated. You get what you give, an she hasnt given so NTA.", "NTA you had an arrangement that she confidently failed to hold up", "NTA. It's not reciprocal. The agreement was canceled when she failed to uphold her part of the deal.", "NTA", "Nta", "nta", "NTA", "NTA. The division of cooking duties was already extremely skewed - how much more considerate do you need to be? Don't be a doormat. Tell her to stop being a useless freeloader and make her fend for herself EVERY day, until she can at the bare minimum cook food for you both for at least Thurs-Fri from now on. If she doesn't, then tell her and the friends agreeing with her to bugger off - send them a link to this post or something.", "NTA\n\nif failure to cook shows lack of care then what does her lack of cooking say?", "NTA her being unwilling to fulfill her side is proof she doesn't care about you /s. Does she know how to cook?", "NTA Your friends who told you to be more considerate are just cowards who would rather give into someone demands rather than confront them for being ridiculous. \nYour agreement also has been broken, so I\u2019d stop cooking for her at all.\n\nYou\u2019re already showing signs of resentment. It will only make it worse if you give in.\nI do think you should have a talk with her to see what her issue is.", "NTA \n\nI didn\u2019t make you any because I figured you couldn\u2019t be hungry since it\u2019s your night to cook and you weren\u2019t doing so. Every. Single. Time.", "NTA and why are you cooking 4 days a week and she's not even bothering with one? She's not a child. From now on each of you handle preparing your own food.", "I know she knows less about cooking than I do. It's possible that she's too proud to admit she finds it overwhelming. I think trying to cook together is a good idea! I'll run it by her.", "I've mentioned it to her a few times. She usually brushes me off and says she'll do it next time.", "i don't know how to cook much of anything & i'm 63 years old so obviously i've managed to survive. it's great that you're wanting to teach her how to cook but as far as this situation is concerned, she could have have just made herself a sandwich, opened a can of soup or eaten cereal. it's not as if she was going to starve to death, so IMO you have no reason to feel guilty. NTA.", "NTA - if she had listened when you addressed it the first (or even second) time you brought it up, you wouldn\u2019t have had to prove to her that she\u2019s being an AH by expecting you to cook even on her nights. I would stop cooking for her on the other nights, as well."]}
