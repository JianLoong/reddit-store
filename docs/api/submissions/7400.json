No luck so far but the doctor did say at our first appointment that it typically takes close to a year for most couples to conceive. She\u2019s been telling people that she\u2019s infertile (which isn\u2019t true, doctor said she isn\u2019t). \n\nMy wife and I went to my work Christmas party in mid December, where my wife met my coworkers wife (let\u2019s call her Mary) and they took a liking to each other. Mary was pregnant and invited my wife to her baby shower (which was yesterday), and my wife sounded excited to go. I asked her when we were alone if she thinks she\u2019ll be fine. I know my wife and I know what typically bothers her. I knew she wouldn\u2019t bask in happiness over someone else\u2019s pregnancy so I urged her to think it through. She said she\u2019s fine and she was excited so she went.\n\nThe baby shower was yesterday. About 40 minutes in, she calls me and asks me to come. I was at a cafe nearby because I knew she wouldn\u2019t stay long. I find her at the entrance of the house crying and a BUNCH of women consoling her. When she saw me she came to me and pulled me to the garden to talk. She said she was dancing and looked at Mary\u2019s pregnant belly and couldn\u2019t take it anymore, started crying and ran out. All of Mary\u2019s friends followed her out to console her. I consoled her myself, and said \u201cok let\u2019s go babe. Where do you want to go? We can go for a drive so you can feel better\u201d, she looked at me weird and asked why she would leave. I asked why she would stay. She said she feels better now and can go have a good time. I sighed and said \u201cbabe, you know that\u2019s not going to happen. And I doubt the attention will be on Mary after this and that\u2019s not great. It\u2019s her baby shower and she deserves to be celebrated. I can\u2019t see how people are going to shift their focus from consoling you to celebrating her if you\u2019re still there\u201d. She rolled her eyes at me and said she was going back in and that I could leave.\n\n3 hours later, the party was nearing its end so I go back to pick her up. My coworker and I stepped into the house and lo and behold, everyone is sitting in a circle with my wife being the centre of attention. Coworker looked for his wife and she wasn\u2019t there at all. He called her and she said she had left ages ago. \n\nMy wife and I entered the car and I first asked her how she was feeling and we spoke about it for a few minutes. I then asked her what happened and why Mary left. She said \u201coh crap, Mary. I forgot to say bye to her\u201d. I told her Mary left ages ago. I then said \u201cI know you\u2019re going through a hard time but why on earth would you and her friends do this? If they consoled you for a few minutes that\u2019s fine but the entire party? We really should\u2019ve left earlier\u201d. She looked at me so offended and said \u201care you Mary\u2019s husband or mine?\u201d. We stared at each other for a while and just drove home in silence. I told her I want to talk to her this morning to sort things out but she ignored me and left the house.", "created_utc": 1673795714, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cm7if/aita_for_telling_my_wife_it_was_a_mistake_to_stay/", "score": 15310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is telling people she is infertile (and does she believe this?), and crying at a borderline stranger's baby shower and grabbing attention from a bunch of other strangers???\n\nI'm sure your wife is having some type of mental health issues, they are making her act horribly towards others.

Your wife should apologise then get some professional help.", "NTA but your wife was 1000%\n\nYou BOTH owe mary an apology and a gift from her registry to try and make up for ruining her baby shower. Yes, your wife ruined someones baby shower because she couldn't stand not having attention for one day. She sounds selfish and not at all mature enough to raise a child. I would personally ask her to seek counseling for her narcissist tendencies before you go bringing a child into the mix.", "NTA.\n\nBut I would tell your wife that a condition of continuing to try to get pregnant is that you attend couples\u2019 counseling. This needs to be nipped in the bud NOW, or she\u2019s going to continue this kind of attention-seeking and drama.", "NTA - She definitely should have left but didn't want to because she got so much attention. Enough to ruin the party for the person the party was actually for, which I think is a useful insight into the kind of person she is. She seems to not care how she gets attention, even lying about her fertility status isnt over the line for her. I would recommend not having a child with her until she works on her mental health issues. A child is going to become the center of attention while mom becomes the invisible support system. She's not going to stand for that and I've seen enough stories about attention seeking mothers to know that's going to be a problem for you and the child.", " Show her the comments. So she sees it\u2019s not just you that think she did something that\u2019s so messed up", "NTA. Good luck being married to her.", "NTA\n\nWow your wife totally crapped on poor Marys baby shower. What a egotistical wife you have. My condoleances.", "NTA, but your wife sure is. I understand wanting to conceive and having trouble is tough; but it seems even before she went to this party you expected this sort of behavior from her which makes me think she taking any chance she can to ruin the joy of other people\u2019s pregnancies because she hasn\u2019t had her own. Her actions and worse, her response to expect absolute loyalty in the face of your very valid view of how inappropriate her behavior was would give me pause in thinking of having a child with her. Selfishness to this level in a parent can be detrimental to a child, and I would think long and hard whether you want to sign a kid up for that.", "When she starts talking to you again, ask her how she will feel at her baby shower if all of her guests abandon her for someone else and no one even notices if she leaves.  She knows she did something wrong and now she's pouting about it because she's also embarrassed.  You OP are NTA and I'm sorry for any strain this puts on your work relationships", "NTA. \n\nYou can obviously see how wrong your wife was.

I don\u2019t blame her for the initial distress but this could\u2019ve all been avoided had she just left with you when you suggested it. I can\u2019t bring myself to understand why she stayed.

Your wife literally made someone else\u2019s baby shower all about her. To the point where the person it was for left early and she didn\u2019t even notice. That is so incredibly selfish and rude!!! She absolutely should have left after she got upset the first time and realized she was taking attention away from Mary. Your wife needs to apologize, and then go get some sort of therapy.", "NTA. Your wife needs to speak to a therapist, if this is how she is handling things four months in. \n\nLook, wanting to be pregnant and seeing negative tests all the time is hard. But doctors won\u2019t even be concerned after four months of trying. It took us 2.5 years to conceive. Years. I had friends who had two babies in the time it took me to have one. I went to a dozen baby showers. Never once did I mention my troubles or cause a scene to pull attention away from the guest of honor. Your wife knew what she was doing, and she should be embarrassed.", "Oh, poor Mary! What your wife did was incredibly selfish. She ruined the experience for Mary, ruined her potential new friendship, possibly ruined your relationship with your colleague. NTA", "I don't really know where to start with this. Your wife sounds like A LOT. You've only been trying to conceive since September. That's hardly any time at all...it's very unusual to get pregnant straight away. There is no evidence there's an issue, yet she's acting like she's having fertility issues, which is very attention-seeking behaviour and pretty insensitive to people with real problems. Then she meets this woman just a few weeks ago, goes to her baby shower and completely ruins it and makes it all about herself. That's really horrible.\n\nNTA for telling her that she shouldn't have stayed, you're completely right, but you're a little bit TA for enabling your wife's unhinged behaviour.", "NTA - the sooner your wife realizes she is not the main character in every else life and the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her, the better. \n\nHowever, you\u2019ve seen how she behaves, what you decide to do with this information is up to you. She is utterly selfish. Will your wife be upset when you start paying more attention to the kids than her? You can say it\u2019s only pregnancy, but it\u2019s not. This is how she behaves when she\u2019s stressed and isn\u2019t getting her way.\n\nEdit: wording", "NTA but your wife sure is. She is also not mature enough or emotionally ready to be pregnant and have children if this is how she behaves. She completely ruined her coworkers shower and is absolutely disgusting that she is lying about her fertility.", "Holy hell this is so embarrassing for you. There is so much to unload here. You have been trying to conceive for 4 months & this is how she\u2019s acting?\nYou wife is ridiculous & I wish you the best of luck. Also you might want to start looking for a new job.", "NTA. \n\nI'm sorry your wife is struggling with not having been able to get pregnant yet, I truly am. But what she did was awful and just... SO fucking inconsiderate. Your wife *ruined* Mary's shower by turning it into a pity party for herself. Is she always this selfish and self-centered? Do you even *want* to have a child with a woman who would do something this horrible?", "NTA. What a pity that your wife doesn\u2019t have the awareness(?), to know what she did by stealing the spotlight, so to speak. She should be ashamed of herself instead of looking for your support in this situation she created.", "NTA I don't think you should be having a child with a person this selfish", "NTA. She planned this from the moment she was invited. Good luck if you choose to live the rest of your life with this kind of human.", "NTA but come on your wife does not need a child but a therapist. She literally turned someone elses baby shower into a pity party for herself and can't even see how horrible that was of her?", "NTA please get your wife into some therapy before you have kids. My mom was just like your wife and childhood/adulthood has been awful with her self-centered/attention-seeking behavior. Was so harmful to witness and destroyed our family.", "NTA at all your wife was so out of line and self centred it hurts to read.\n\nOP I know its hard but I'd seriously reconsider having a child with this woman. This incident isn't just about her wrongly self diagnosed 'infertility' its a very distinct personality trait and not a very good one. She has proven to be mean, callous, self-entered, selfish, egotistical and without regard for other peoples emotions and their significant milestones.", "Nta and you need to pause trying for a baby until you sort this out. Frankly this sounds malicious by your wife and you need to seriously consider if you should be with this person or have a kid with her.", "NTA. \n\nYour wife is not a good person. But I think you already knew that because you had an inkling of what would happen if she stayed. And you're still married to her. I feel sorry for you, and I wonder about your stability that you married a narcissist and actually thought having a baby with her would be a good idea. \n\nI suggest you get counseling to find out why you married this person and find a way to break away before she destroys your life. But please, please do not have a baby with her.", "NTA but I would put the baby making plans on pause for now. Either she\u2019s too immature and self-centred to be a parent or she has some mental health issues that need to be addressed. \n\nAlso, four months of trying to conceive is nothing. It took me three months and out of everyone I know that was the fastest.", "NTA but your wife is a massive asshole. I hope Mary gets to ruin her baby shower, but then your wife is so self-centred *she* would throw a tantrum over it.\n\nSuch a pitiful woman, over just 4 months trying.", "NTA\nIf I was you I'd start paying closer attention to her attitude/behaviour/reactions etc.\nThis is a massive red flag for you, a women like this will never put you or a child first, just herself", "NTA. You were right to try and put the focus back on the shower recipient. Your wife has some envy issues that need to be worked on.", "NTA - I find it hard to believe your wife could be so oblivious.", "NTA but maybe you should reconsider trying for a child with her right now\u2026", "NTA. You were right. Rather than the baby shower being about Mary, it was then about your wife when she started crying and refused to leave. Your wife really needs to apologize to Mary.", "NTA. Wow, what kind of person can\u2019t be happy for other people, has to ruin their experience, and then when called out flips it to blame you for thinking of Mary.", "NTA. my partner and I are actually diagnosed with infertility after numerous losses, are starting our 2nd round of ivf, and I would never hijack someone\u2019s shower like this. People really need to understand they\u2019re not the main character of the universe. Know your limits! Since getting diagnosed, I have been to just one shower for a dear friend - I smiled through the painful \u201cgames\u201d, baby talk, etc. because I love her and was happy for her. I haven\u2019t been able to go to others because it\u2019s just too hard. My nightmare would be pulling attention from someone else because I chose to place myself in a situation I couldn\u2019t handle!!! Big NTA. \n\nYour wife needs to talk to someone. Like her I had a huge fear of being infertile - lo and behold it actually came true. I\u2019m still standing! Life proceeds apace. Stressing about it beforehand didn\u2019t lessen the pain of our reality when we were hit with it much later. Wishing you the best and hoping your wife can get some help.", "NTA. Poor Mary. She ruined her baby shower just because she wanted attention and sympathy over her made up problems.", "NTA. She is incredibly selfish, unsure about what the rest of your relationship is but encourage therapy.. if not you know what to do.", "NTA. I feel like your wife did this intentionally.

A 26 year old who just trying to start to conceive declaring herself infertile and then crying about it repeatedly at SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOWER is not normal by any means.

Your wife is a piece of work.", "You don\u2019t want to have a kid with this person. \n\nSource: mother of 2 after LONG infertility struggle and I NEVER pulled shit like this.

You tried to do the right thing at every turn and your wife\u2019s defiance of each suggestion just made things worse for Mary. I\u2019m actually stunned that an adult woman could be so self-centered and immature and that a group of other adults catered to her to the point that the honoree left her own shower.", "NTA.

Hopefully she can understand in the future. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you guys are going through this. \nBut I\u2019m also sorry that Mary had to have this experience at her baby shower, especially when typically you only get one baby shower for your first babe (where I live anyway).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think if she really thought she were infertile, she'd be crying to her own friends and family. Maybe she's exhausted the sympathy from her own friends/family and has to hijack some other woman's. And at her day if celebration, no less.", "When spouse and I got engaged, I met his paternal grandmother. She was sweet and welcoming and delightful. It was only later that I heard the stories about her (like how after my FIL was born, she could no longer have babies, and she reminded him of that often) and realized she was narcissistic. Just like my own paternal GM.\n\nPoint is, yes, narcissists can be v charming.", "It\u2019s. Been. Four. Months. The worst part of which is probably the scheduled sex.\n\nETA: I realized this could be read as an insult to OP. Having gone through the process three times, I know how annoying it is to have required times for sex, that's all.", "She'll seek attention for the \"miracle\" pregnancy.", "Just popping in to say- don\u2019t automatically expect a repeat on the second go-around (if you want a second!). My first took almost 2 years to conceive, and I did all the things- temp, charts, the works. My second was an out-of-expected ovulation-window pull-out method surprise (didn\u2019t want to chance birth control after the first took so long). Use the condoms if you\u2019re not quite ready to be pregnant again lol", "I think she also knows that if/when she does get pregnant it\u2019ll be a \u201cmiracle\u201d meaning even more attention. She definitely has issues.", "I was literally thinking that any kids of hers would be victims of MBP.", "No offense, but your wife sounds like my step-mom, everything, even bad things that happened to us, she made all about her. I was raped at age 20 and everything was still somehow about her.\n\nShe was eventually diagnosed with Histrionic Personality Disorder, but by that time it was way too late for my family because us kids were in our late 20s and she had manipulated my dad thoroughly and destroyed our relationship with him entirely. \n\nHe died 2 years ago at 55 and I haven\u2019t visited his grave yet because I\u2019m still so angry he chose to marry such a selfish, horrible woman and chose her over us.\n\nShe tried to steal the entirety of my dads and paternal grandpas estates and give us nothing a week after dad\u2019s death and I had to spend TWO YEARS taking her to court to make sure my younger sibling and I got our fair share (state dictated, spouse gets half and kids split the other half) of our inheritance. \n\nShe still posts on Facebook about how terrible we are and how we inherited the bulk of our dad\u2019s money (not true, she got 95% of life insurance which totaled out to almost a million dollars and who knows how much she took from the estate.) she told her attorney she couldn\u2019t pay her because she was so broke, even though she\u2019d got a direct deposit of $900,000 a month before, meanwhile she kept us from getting anything of our dads, threw out every piece of his clothing we asked to have. \n\nThe only personal item of his we have is the sweater of his I wore in the hospital as he was dying. A judge laughed at her in court because she called us \u201cdemon children\u201d seriously right to his face. We had a private investigator look into her and she has a deep criminal history of prostitution and financial fraud.", "A lot of people feel that way, OP. And it sounds like until recently, your wife was doing the mature thing (re: not using her failures to rain down on other people's successes, saving her frustrations for later, etc.)\n\nSomething changed, recently - as you just stated, she's never made a public scene before. On top of that, she's lying about infertility.\n\nIf this were a lifelong pattern, I would call that narcissism. But the fact that this is *new* behavior from her? I would seriously pursue some form of counseling or therapy, because something is not right.", "She doesn't currently sound like someone who's in a place where she should have a kid. It's a human life, not a contest or an achievement.\n\nGod forbid the kid get more attention than her.", "> she didn\u2019t cause a scene at any of the parties or at the wedding and put up the whole \u201chappy for you\u201d act quite well\n\nSo the happiness she shows for people is an act? Wtf?!", "This. Four months of trying? The most they\u2019re going to do is ask about cycle tracking, they won\u2019t be doing any fertility testing at this point unless there are other issues (like irregular cycles).", "I agree. She's not infertile and it takes most couples a few tries to get pregnant. Yet OP's wife isn't pregnant first try and cries at seeing someone being pregnant. She doesn't seem secure (or possibly) mature enough to handle being a parent. I think she needs therapy and this is nothing on you.\n\nNTA.", "She could have fertility issues, she just doesn't know about it and has some mental health issue telling her she has.\n\nOr she's been trying to get pregnant from a lot longer than OP with sabotaging BC...", "She's not lying to family and friends because they'd know it wasn't true. At least, not lying to them about *this* subject.", "She would actually get slapped in the face if she did this", "I remember attending my older sister's third baby shower six months after I lost a baby.    \nI would not have attended if I couldn't hold it together and be happy for her.  (She would have utterly understood my absence having been the person who held my hand the most during that long night).    \n\n\nI remember her telling me she'd gotten pregnant like she was in a confessional. It's funny now (If you like dark crunchy humor).   \nBut this lady? This lady is stealing drama from folks who have actually been thru it - real people live this sort of drama.  That's the upsetting part.  And OP tried his best to decrease the drama and do something appropriate about it.    \n\n\nI feel for him wondering what to do next.    \nTherapy BTW - get her to a therapist and don't engage in any more unprotected sex until she's cleared of whatever this is).  She could just be confabulating a thing in her mind (Building a castle in the air) or something could be really wrong with her mentally that needs to be addressed.", "That\u2019s understanding your limits and is smart. This woman is stirring up drama for the sake of it.", "Yeah there's something seriously wrong, and a child shouldn't be brought into it.\n\nAlso I'm sorry for your loss, and so happy you and your sister were able to support each other!", "Yeah, it actually makes me feel sick to consider pulling all the attention from someone at their party! And I have an actual issue, not making stuff up! Though honestly, most of the time the person breaking down and then not leaving is looking for attention.\n\nMy only public meltdown (that I remember, there's a chunk of time I can't remember) I went to the Disney store in a mall because our roommate at the time wanted something. My partner and I split up looking, and it came over the speakers that Mickey and Minnie were going to make a video call in five minutes. All the kids started screaming, and next thing I know my friend had me outside with my head between my knees. I sent her back to my partner with the wallet so he could get the thing for the roommate because I wasn't going back in! I hope I didn't scare any of the kids, tbh.", "They aren't supposed to conceive sooner, it's that if you are struggling at that age the sooner you get help the better. Sometimes it takes a year or so with young people. It just happens. But at 35 or older you are running out of time.", "Time is much more critical past the age of 35. The younger you are when you do treatments, the greater the chances of success.", "OP was already on standby waiting for an issue to pop up. He is well trained. She definitely sounds like a serial narcissist.", "Thank you for this answer, I would've been confused as well. This makes a lot of sense"]}
