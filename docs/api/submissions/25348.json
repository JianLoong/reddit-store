The niece knows both OP and her mom personally and for many years. Niece decided to cutoff one of those people and not the other implying that one is not worth having in her life.

This would only stir up more conflict, but I would be tempted in your place to ask your mother what she did to prevent this from happening, every time she brings it up.

Obviously OP\u2019s sister made some big mistakes and her daughter deserves to be with people who don\u2019t hurt her.\n\nWhile OP\u2019s sister deserved this, she is still hurt.

I suspect some sibling rivalry and jealousy here and you are now taking a victory lap because you are the good mom, and she is the baddie like you always thought.

NTA btw!!", "NTA -- Tell your mom she is trying to parent the wrong adult daughter. Ask her why she thinks your sister was such a lousy parent and if she might not be better served working through that than getting upset with you. Maybe ask her how she was able to watch her daughter neglect her grandchild for 18 years without trying to interfere. I mean, she has energy to chastise you over a grown woman's feelings, but did she have that same energy when it was a child being mistreated?  \n\n\nBe there for your niece and tell anyone else who isn't to kick rocks and die mad in whatever order suits them.", "NTA Actions, or in this case, LACK of actions, have consequences.", "NTA.

She spent more time with my oldest brother instead of her only daughter in the family. She never wanted me around at all she only wanted boys around and doesn't want anything to do with me ever since I was born with a mental disability. She literally didn't want me around at all. Ever since I finally managed to get on my own two feet scrape off the crud that my mother left behind on me and moved on because apparently my mother said that she loves me but she physically doesn't so I don't know what to make of it I can't make heads or tails out of that and she left me no choice but to sever all ties with her because apparently she didn't want me around ever since I was doing with organizations and she didn't want them around her house because she literally thinks that oh well I don't want them around here because they probably will think I'm a bad mother and they're going to report me to children services and I'm like mother they're only there for me they won't do a damn thing like that and now it's like she definitely double crossed the line so now I am glad I have no contact with her ever.

Puppies aren't treated that badly.", "Her grandfather died a few years back. She just had to turn eighteen to claim her section of the inheritance. I thought it was weird, too. She was like, hey auntie, look at all this money I just got! And I was like what the actual fuck. You know? Lol. Kid got more money with one signature than I've made in fifteen freaking years.", "Probably. She's been telling us how much she hates her parents since she was six or so. So its been a long time coming. I don't think she's ever really liked them.\n\nThe worst one, actually, was when she changed her names spelling (think Laila to Layla). Her parents didn't even seem to notice. I still don't think they know.", "I am aware that I'm a good mom, seperate to her. \n\nHer pain is her own fault. We warned her.\n\nAnd no, no drugs on anyone.

Your sisters feelings at least, I feel bad for your niece and wish her all the best.", "You have to move those speech marks a word to the right.\n\n>!\"Sorry for laughing. LOL!\"!<", "I think that's the only apology I could muster.

Huh. Thank you for that.", "Haha.  Sounds like she's a good kid who loves her auntie!  Just make sure the money is protected.  She's a little young to have that kind of dough without sound financial advice!", "I\u2019m so glad for her that she\u2019s got you in her life!! It is an unimaginable tragedy to watch a child be less loved than they deserve\u2026\n\nI know a kid who will probably go through the same thing in like 13yrs.

But the question isn\u2019t \u2018am I the asshole for being a good mom and her being a bad mom.\u2019 It\u2019s whether you were the asshole for laughing at her in her deepest pain. Sounds like you struggle to have empathy for her and that\u2019s understandable, but if you are a good mom you probably can see how you are better than this.", "I get your point but celebrating people's misery is in pretty poor taste. It's sad and in the long run the sister will probably suffer enough on her own realizing she lost her daughter without the need for OP to rub her nose in it.\n\nIt's sadistic in a way, or maybe just schadenfreude. Its her sister, she's in pain, regardless of whether she brought the pain on herself and is directly and solely responsible is besides the point.", "\"I'm sorry you're a dumbass\" probably won't do much to clear the air either", "I think it has to do with emotional intelligence and social awareness. You could be a great mechanic or mathematician, but if you're not emotionally intelligent you either come across as dense or mean. I'm pretty aware that if I never get in contact with my friend, although none of us harbors negative feelings, the friendship will likely turn into an acquaintance and I might not get invited if they have a wedding. OP's sister doesn't realise this, she's emotionally and socially unaware of consequences.... probably because she's unaware of other people's feelings, too. That shows a lack of empathy.\n\n\n\n\nHaving low empathy (unless it's some serious mental illness) is usually related to having low emotional intelligence, which is how people like OP's sister FAFO and still don't learn the lesson. I bet anyone she complains to will get a dose of the [missing missing reasons](http://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html) because she seems, genuinely, stumped to find out her daughter is rightfully bitter at her. Did she act awful and had it coming? Based on the post, yeah absolutely. Was it foreseeable and preventable? 100%. But did she really feel hurt OP laughed in her face? Probably yes, she sounds like she only knows and considers her own feelings.", "\u2018I told you so\u2019 is an asshole thing to say, right?", "My sympathy for OPs sister is nonexistent in the face of the pain she brought her own daughter. Poor kid had to grow up being neglected and unloved by her own parents. And the fact that she \u201cjust doesn\u2019t understand\u201d means she hasn\u2019t accepted her role in the damage to this relationship. Now if she had come to OP wishing she could take it all back, I might see your point more."]}
