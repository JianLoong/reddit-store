Sometimes when someone makes terrible decisions like her, such as being a crappy parent, its appropriate to laugh at their idiotic mistakes backfiring on them. Could you have been nicer? Maybe? Would she have deserved that? No", "NTA. ah, so you found a diplomatic way of saying, \"I told you so.\"", "NTA\n\nyour sister brought it on herself. I'm happy for your niece too", "She treated her kid like a puppy and is now upset that her daughter is not a stupid puppy who loves her no matter what.", "NTA she was warned but she was too busy being selfish to be a parent\n\n her daughter owes her NOTHING \n\n and it sounds like your mother was enabling her to abuse her own child (neglect is abuse)\nShe's the one who needs to apologise to her daughter maybe use some of that money to pay for therapy but she's still owed nothing she made a series of decisions every time she abandoned her own daughter to go party hope the memories of those parties keep her company in her old age because the daughter she neglected is free now and isn't obligated to do shit for her and likely won't", "NTA \n\nYour sister is emotionally illiterate. The difference is that she had a mother to parent her while she didn\u2019t to her own daughter. She reaped what she sowed. \n\nThe only one who should be apologizing and making amends is your sister to her daughter. What you said wasn\u2019t immature but factual.", "NTA - is it the nicest thing to do? No. Does she deserve \u201cnice\u201d after spending 18 years neglecting her daughter and ignoring your attempts to help? Hell no.", "NTA - Based on your post of your sister\u2019s lack of mothering her own child, don\u2019t bother to apologize. Your sister put her wants above her daughter-always.  I suggest you follow your niece\u2019s example and go no contact with sis also!", "NTA - \"I told you so\" is a correct answer.\n\nYou didn't gave her the warnings because you are a bad person.\n\nYou tried to help her.\n\nShe had the choice of not listening.\n\nShe had the choice of not coming to you to complain about the result.\n\nShe had it coming.", "I mean laughing in your sisters face and telling her your glad her daughter cut her off (that's how she provably perceived you being happy for your niece), is pretty low. \n\nDo I think you need to apologize? No. It would be insincere anyway. So why be forced to do so?\n\nMind you, I am not on her side. I think you did everything you could to warn her.\nIt\u2019s just sad that she never got the hint and ruined the relationship with her daughter. \nBut there was no reason to pour salt in the wounds.", "NTA. You get out of kids what you put in. They don\u2019t owe you anything because you gave birth to them. Sounds like one switched on kid. Probably saved herself years of neglect at the hands of a narcissist.", "NTA you reap what you sow.", "Nta lmao. It\u2019s quite laughable that your sister was super surprised your niece dropped her when you gave her all the warning signs. Don\u2019t apologize. Your sister should\u2019ve woken up as soon as you warned her.", "NTA", "NTA and I wouldn\u2019t apologize! Poor kid grew up with an absent mother who was too self-absorbed to care for and bind with her. How selfish can people be? Your sister deserves the reaction she got, especially since yinz have warned her over the years it would happen. Cellars she didn\u2019t take you seriously", "NTA. But I think you and your parents should try to stay in your niece\u2019s life if she\u2019s ok with that. 18 is so young to not have anyone to go to.", "You are not better than your sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The niece knows both OP and her mom personally and for many years. Niece decided to cutoff one of those people and not the other implying that one is not worth having in her life. The other family surrounding them was also not surprised that this action took place again, implying that the sister's shitty behavior was known and notorious in the family."]}
