There should be no expectation for you to pony up food for someone else's kids. Could you have asked? Sure, or the other kid's parents could have called their kid over to them and said \"no don't bother the nice lady, we have food for you.\" Shoulda/Coulda/Woulda works both ways, and you are fine.", "NTA.

Better safe than sorry!", "NTA- You brought snacks for your kid, not to feed other people's kid. The other parents can get mad, but they should have come prepared and not expected other parents to feed them. I have 4 kids and I have always brought snacks and would never get mad at another parent for saying no to my kid. Part of being a parent is being prepared, so if they go out then they need to bring things for their kid.", "Definitely NTA. The other parent should have had a closer watch on their kid before she even got close enough to try and take your food! What if you had been some stranger with candy trying to lure the child away?
