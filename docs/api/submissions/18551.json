I was away last weekend for a girls trip, the first trip like that that I\u2019ve taken since he passed. \n\nWhile I was away my sister (36f), her husband (38m) and two kids (14m and 12f) had a night in my city in their way to a vacation destination. I was disappointed not to be able to see them, but I offered to let them stay overnight in my place, and they accepted. I gave them the codes to the door and the lay of the land, restaurants, etc., all good. The only caveat I mentioned to her was that in the master bathroom, I had some personal photos hanging, just so she\u2019s aware. \n\nAbout the photos \u2014 they were taken by my husband on our honeymoon, and they mean a lot to me. He was a photographer, and he took these shots of me at a waterfall and a stream we came upon during a hike. They are artistic nudes. I keep them up in my private space at home as a reminder of our times together. \n\nWell, my sister was not pleased that they were up. She said she didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what I meant by \u201cpersonal photos\u201d and that I should have given her more warning, since of course they would be taking a look around my new place. I said I didn\u2019t consider those kinds of photos a big deal - they are from 6 years ago, a different time in my life after all - and in any case I had given her warning. She went on to say some stuff that I thought wasn\u2019t constructive, including that having photos of like that would be a turnoff to any future guys I\u2019d date, and is kind of narcissistic.

I don\u2019t find anything offensive about the human form. I have a few nude paintings in my home because I admire the strength they project.

I feel like you gave her fair warning and maybe she just shouldn\u2019t have invaded your private space. Also, the things she said are rude! Good for you to be happy and confident enough to be able to hang those pictures and enjoy the memories they bring. If any issues come up with future partners (I doubt there will be any) they can be discussed then and are none of your sisters business!

You can hang whatever you want in your own home and she\u2019s out of line for making rude comments about your design choices.

If she was concerned and unclear about what you meant, she should have asked. \"Personal\" almost always means NSFW the same was \"adult\" does. Personally, I prefer clearer language (\"Hey sis, I have some tasteful nudes in the bedroom\"), but since you took the time to mention it she really should have asked if she didn't understand. \n\nWhat did she think you meant, just fully-clothed vacation photos that you decided to \"warn\" her about??", "NTA - your sister is an AH for comments about the photos and guys etc. \n\nBut tbh, you should have just told her what they were explicitly. Im all for you having artistic nudes up or even unartistic ones if thats your thing. But your sister probably didnt want to see that. \n\nAre you an AH for using not the best explanation, no. But  lesson learned.", "NTA- She does not need to go to your house again if it's so offensive.\n\nI'm glad you have something that reminds you of your partner.", "NTA, it's your house, in your private area.

That's your business. \n\nYou suck because you should've clarified that you had nude photos of yourself in the bathroom. That would be a shock to anyone walking into.\n\nYour sister sucks, even more so, because she's calling you narcissistic and claiming that this will be a negative for any future mate. That's crap.
