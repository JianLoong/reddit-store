Please know that everyone is smart and worthy in different ways and that life is never a competition between you and your siblings.

Anyone who was trying to focus on you will feel like you bit their head off (uncle) and the people who possibly do favor your sister will just think you\u2019re a brat and feel justified. Basically, you make yourself look bad. I am mortified as an adult when I think back to incidents like this when I was so sure that people must be seeing how poorly I was being treated while I frowned and sighed and answered shortly if people tried to talk to me.

No one knows what the future holds and you don't know how you or her will turn out.", "NTA, but it's still not great on any end. \n\nYour family should obviously be able to support you without making it about your sister, and should recognize you too, but from your description it seems like your uncle was trying to do just that. \n\nYou shouldn't have snapped at him, but I don't think you're as unjustified in your annoyance as some other people on this thread will say. Being less \"good\" than a sibling is NEVER the other siblings fault, it's just luck.\n\nAnd yeah, family woll treat you unfairly because of that, will make you feel unwanted and unimportant, even if it sucks. The best thing you can do is make them understand _that you feel this way_ and why that is hurting you.\n\nBeing mean to them feels good, yeah. They've been mean to you. But being mean won't make it better. Giving them a good and clear chance to understand your viewpoint and feelings is the best that's doable.\n\nAnd if that also doesn't work, screw em. Nobody should be put down because others are better then them. If they blame you for being yourself, that's on them.", "NTA this was your graduation party not your sisters and yet they made it all about her. I find it very disrespectful and I'd be very angry as well. Your uncle asked you that to know if you were going to follow your \"perfect sister's steps\", it has happened to me in my family as well. I had the perfect aunt; everything was about her and when I told them a was going to university, they told me they hope I would achieve the same as her and she could help me because she knew a lot about everything. But later they realized she wasn't so perfect and half of my family end up hating her. So happy ending. :)", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have snapped at your uncle if I were you I\u2019d at least apologize to him and explain that it wasn\u2019t on him, it\u2019s just the accumulation of everyone only talking about your sister was a bit much for you and that you are sorry it came out on him.", "NTA. From all your comments, I understand your frustration and your young, which isn't a bad thing. You shouldn't have blown up on your uncle but your still young and emotional blow ups happen.

He wanted to talk about you... but you didn't allow for that to happen. You were in your own head, stewing and getting mad instead.\n\nHow much of this is objectively true? \n\nYOU say her grades make her \"better\" than you... But your parents have not said this? You may be creating your own hell here, with your insecurities and feeling of inferiority... If your parents have not said this to you, then you may be creating this reality nside your head and living it, and denying yourself from enjoying being with your family.\n\nYou're young, and at this age, you really need to be brave and share your feelings with your family. They can't read your mind, so they can't know what will trigger a nasty response like your poor uncle got.\n\nYou may be doing yourself a huge disservice here by believing something that isn't true. Talk to your family. Let them know that you're hurting, and need some one on one time with them, and for them to acknowledge nad praise your accomplsihments too.  Getting a therapist isn't a bad idea too to be able to work through these big emotions you're carrying around.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you've been marginalized and ignored. Your family should be ashamed.

But....  I'll put it like this.  I have 2 kids, they fight  constantly and when one is slighted they retaliate making both of them the asshole.  There really isn't any mediation at that point they're both wrong and they're both justified. They just gotta walk away.  That's what you got here, both sides being the ahole. They didn't handle you well and you have been sitting on this too long making it a bigger issue that came to a head. Maybe you should confront your parents when you can find some rationale and lay your feelings about things on the table. Give them a chance to show you who they are and then scorch the earth if necessary.", "Your uncle saw what was happening and tried to steer the conversation back to you and got snapped at.

Make sure your hitting the right target when you go to make a point.", "Gentle YTA because your uncle seemed to be well-intentioned. Your parents should've been more understanding.\n\nHere's my insight as an overshadowed sibling to another. I know very well that it's tough but life isn't all about academic grades. I hope you keep exploring new hobbies and find something you're really good at to help you build self-love. There will always be someone who's better than you, and it's a hard pill to swallow, but remember that it doesn't always have to be a competition. It's not your sister's fault that she's a high achiever, but you should learn to focus on yourself and be satisfied with your own achievement. If you feel that your family members are making things worse by showing blatant favoritism, you can choose distance yourself from the toxicity.\n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA. I don\u2019t wanna say you\u2019re TA bc I have the PERFECT older sister. Literally. And I get it, it sucked to be in their shadow by whole life. I saw her as prettier, smarter, more popular, she traveled the whole world and knows multiple languages, literally one of those people everyone knows about in our town. I was always XYZ\u2019s sister. But, I\u2019ve learned that my sister is so like able bc she really is amazing and I\u2019m grateful to have her. I\u2019ve accepted myself as more quiet and not as smart as her, BUT I have amazing qualities she doesn\u2019t have either! We\u2019re different people but valuable in different ways. I suggest you make a list of great qualities you have that highlight who you are. You are not your sister, you don\u2019t need to be similar to her. And sometimes people give attention to people who are more extroverted, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t think you\u2019re amazing as well. People love a kind person, tap into that and become THAT person. You can become the super kind person, the generous person, the one people can rely on for secrets and support. Any sort of quality, feel it deeply and act on it and that become what people know you as and you will gather positive attention too.", "Esh, please apologize to your uncle. He acknowledged that the dinner was about you and you acted rudely.", "It does sound like your parents and aunt tend to focus on your sister. (Is your aunt - not the uncle - the sibling of one of your parents?) It seems like your uncle was returning the spotlight to you, and you lashed out at him of all people.\n\nMaybe you should apologize to HIM for that and possibly use the conversation to also ask him if he sees that dynamic in your family - that all the focus and praise is on your sister. He may see it, too and be able to talk with you about.\n\nIf you are going off to college, you have a chance to do your own thing with no sister-shadow in sight. Enjoy that. While you may have a legitimate hurt and disappointment with your family, you don't want to let that become a boulder-size chip on your shoulder that spoils your relationships with other, completely innocent people.\n\nCongrats on graduating HS! and good wishes to you for the new adventures you have in store!", "NTA.

From what I\u2019ve read in your post I understand exactly what you mean by \u201cNo one says it but I know they prefer her to me.\u201d People are commenting that this shows insecurity but in my own experience my parents would favor my sister in so many ways such as not celebrating my achievements as much, punishing my sister much less harshly compared to me when we both acted up, showing more interests in my sisters interests compared to me, but they would have never said anything like they preferred my sister. I could definitely see myself doing something like this if I was in your scenario, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for it. After growing up and talking to my parents about how my childhood made me feel, they did admit that they treated me unfairly. I hope that it gets better for you soon!", "You\u2019re a kid so your emotional response is justified. But to add perspective, not a competition. Life isn\u2019t a completion.

You have not seen where life takes you OR your sister, and yet you're already setting yourself up for a lifetime of disappointment and failure. Let me give you a few tidbits to help you along:  \n\\- Every family gathering, regardless of the reason, is a reason to celebrate anyone and everyone. Consider any event like this to be about catching up and having a family reunion. It becomes funerals and weddings, and if you have a tight family, you will miss these moments and it becomes just funerals.  \n\\- Grades, degrees, and diplomas are utterly meaningless. What matters is how you apply yourself and the goals you set for yourself. Plenty of people didn't finish school and went on to successful careers doing something they love and are passionate about. Plenty of people finished school with straight A's and work small jobs living paycheck to paycheck. Your B doesn't define who you are and your sister's A doesn't define who she is. Be yourself and don't spend your time comparing yourself. It's a waste of that time you should be using to enjoy your young life AND focus on you and what YOU want to do. That is all that matters.  \n\\- That's it. Life is simple. The world is your oyster as people say. It truly is. Figure out what you want to do and what you need to do to get there. Work hard for it. I was a C+ average in Undergrad because I just didn't want to be there. I went back for an MBA later in life and was President's List the whole time because the motivation changed.

There's two issues here.  The first is insecurity over how your family view you.  I suspect this is just a matter of your sister being older and thus hitting bigger milestone first.  But they're clearly not devaluing you. Your family had a dinner specifically to celebrate your graduation.  Whilst you certainly do deserve to celebrate the milestone it's not reasonable for you to expect the family getting together to avoid talking about your sister's accomplishment and what she's planning to do next.  She has had a major achievement.  It doesn't really matter that you're having a dedicated celebration later that week, given the time of year presumably this is the first time they've had a chance to catch up with her and are excited to hear her news.  You clearly weren't forgotten or left out at your own celebration as your outburst is specifically in response to your uncle turning the conversation back to you.  In other words, a normal dinner party conversation.  I've never been to a celebratory event (family or otherwise) where we talked exclusively about the guest of honor. \n\nThe second issue you should also consider: high school graduation is laudable, well done, however, it's also expected, it's a baseline standard or proof that you can understand your countries local language, do simple maths and that you have a common understanding of the variety of other things you're taught at school.  It's really only notable if you fail (whether it's your fault or those that failed to support you).  Most people will be happy for you in much the same way as a birthday etc.  A college graduation is a rather bigger deal, it's become much more common but proportionately you're still talking about \\~20-25% of people in most western countries if that.  Once you've gotten past the initial congratulations what do you expect people to do for you?\n\nYou were given an event, people celebrated you, asked you about your plans etc.  You got the accolades you deserved, you're just out of touch with your situation.", "Apology to ur uncle and that\u2019s it I say he\u2019s a g", "I have two daughters.

She can also be difficult to talk to, because she gets defensive over just about anything. I always speak very carefully to her. \n\nI can be easier with my younger daughter, she's much more laid back. \n\nBut I love them both with everything I am. I celebrate both of their unique talents. \n\nAs a teacher, I always thought I'd be very disappointed if either girl refused higher education. I surprised myself by realizing it didn't matter, and older daughter can always go to college later in life if she so wishes. \n\nBut neither is lesser in my eyes. \n\nI'm sure that the same is true in your family, you just can't see it.

Regardless of if it was really all dinner or OP\u2019s perception of favoritism in the family.

We where each valued as individuals.", ">It seems she\u2019s been compared to her sister for a decent part of her life\n\nHas everyone else compared her or has she compared herself? She says \"no one ever says it but I know they prefer her over me\" which is not evidence in any way that they actually compare OP to her sister. Even when talking about their grades, OP doesn't say that her family would use her sister as an example of a better student or anything like that. I don't want to outright deny that the sister is the golden child, but this could also very well just be a complex OP has given herself. \n\n>if the sister had her own gathering planned a few days later she should\u2019ve shut the conversation down and saved it for her own party\n\nJust bc the sister is having her own party doesn't mean she can't talk to ppl about what's going on in her life. Just bc a party is centered around someone, that doesn't mean they're the only thing you can talk about it. Graduations, birthdays, weddings, etc-ppl don't spend the whole time only talking about or to the guest of honor.

That would be quite awkward. Now - while it may be customary, at some point during the dinner, for someone to give a toast (during which, everyone will turn their attention to the one giving the toast, much like it were a miniature performance), for the most part the dinner is made up of many small and separate side conversations between people seated near one another. In fact, it can be considered to be quite rude to attempt to carry on a conversation from one end of the table to the other, as it forces the parties who are not party to the conversation to sit quietly by. Now - when having polite dinner conversation, it is common courtesy to ask about what is going on in the lives of the people surrounding you.

But OP doesn't give any indication any such thing occurred.\n\nHonestly, it comes off more like OP's sister lives rent free in OPs head, and the moment anyone gave the sister attention it pushed OP into silent stewing mode, and she remained that way until the uncle turned the attention back to her, and rather than taking the lead and talking about her plans and desires for next steps of her life decided she just wanted to destroy everyone's evening instead.", "A family sitting around with each other are going to just naturally slash organically discuss whatever.

This is all a case of OP being jealous of a gifted sister. \n\nAnd let us not forget that reddit feels that if there is a gifted sibling the parents and other relatives are forbidden from praising or acknowledging that sibling; because obviously that means the one who has worked hard and done well is a golden child and gotten preferential treatment and everyone is trouncing on the poor fee-fees of the obvious scapegoat. Therefore, it is perfectly acceptable for an 18 yr old to lash out, make a scene, pout, give vague context of the dinner, and receive validation from internet strangers about how they have obviously been mistreated.

Your aunt was making conversation with your sister that you took offense with, which is understandable, but when your uncle tried to change the focus from her to you - which is technically what you claim to have wanted - instead of being grateful the spotlight was now on you, at *your* party, you reacted by throwing a tantrum. The tantrum ensured that all eyes were now on you, but it also caused tension and an argument later.

Not even which college are you going to or what will you major in or do you plan to move into dorms or are you getting a job or taking a gap year, no.

Mean people in comments say \"oh what a loser the sister is, compared to her: one is cleaning a**es and the other one walking prestigious events\" (this comment hurts tbh). She is in her path and the mom celebrates the job and important contribution she does everyday. If you want, you can always find a sibling \"not worth celebrating\" if you always compare them. If both have a job, one job will be more prestigious; some jobs are (stupidly) considered almost a shame. If both go to school, one will do better.

I had a friend who was similar to OP but with classic middle child problems and it could be hell trying to talk to her when she had an internal monologue of negativity going about her siblings.

If OP's example is an indication, how do we know that it isn't a standard for her? She has repeated a few times in the comments \"if someone does better, why celebrate at all\" which sounds like it could have easily been her own personal mantra growing up if anyone even mentioned her sister's accomplishments around her own e.g. Dinner guest: \"I know OP and OP's sis both did track in HS.

I\u2019m sure they do but as an adult with a child of my own I\u2019ve told my parents that if baby brother is the favorite it\u2019s ok. I can see why he would be. He\u2019d be my favorite too lol.", "You know, 18 does not mean stupid, They know right from wrong and social skills.

Was it 15 minutes. Was it an hour. Was it a side conversation, was it just a couple of people so it took up the whole table as a conversation? Like what was the dynamic. Without that context it could be a table of 20 people and 5-7 side conversations going on. Or it could have been a table of 5 with one conversation. \n\nEither way OP has only focused on how their older sister has shown her up. Even in the comments. Personally that feels like an unreliable narrator to me. \n\nEspecially as it seemed either way the conversation was about to turn and be about the graduate but Op then shut it down and moped while snapping and mistreating the person steering the conversation in her direction.\n\nI think I really need more info. Until then I\u2019m in YTA territory because at its face value OP hurt someone trying to help her. If other people where being AH too then I\u2019ll move over to ESH. But idk something isn\u2019t sitting well with me and I really don\u2019t trust we\u2019re getting all the info we need to make a clear judgment. This post feels culled back to me.

Art? Music? Or maybe other things that she hasn\u2019t discovered yet, because she\u2019s been so busy trying to excel in the things her sister\u2019s don\u2019t well in.\n\nBut even if OP doesn\u2019t yet have things that she\u2019s proven exceptional at, her parents need to find other ways of making her feel valued - starting with not devoting her graduation dinner to discussing her sister\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nBecause I think, at the end of the day, this isn\u2019t about whether or not it\u2019s right to reward excellence - it\u2019s about her feeling like she isn\u2019t as loved and valued as her sister.

From everything I've read, OP hasn't actually achieved anything and is mad her sister is celebrated when she is achieving. This most common example that OP uses is track. Her sister got a medal - Achievement. OP had a rather undefined 'did good' with no medal. Even if I'm being charitable, a celebration for 'did good' would really just be a participation trophy.\n\nI don't know, what I'm seeing more than anything is OP is measuring herself up to her sister with an inflated sense of her own ego and getting angry when her non-achievements aren't being given the same weight as the actual achievements (to that end, I would like to hear from the sister's perspective about the balance of being celebrated, because while I have no proof of this, I'd suspect there weren't as many as OP acts like), and then uses that as an excuse to not try.", "I hadn't seen that comment.

This could all be her own personal feelings that she doesn\u2019t share and others aren\u2019t aware of or it could be the result of favoritism. But OP hasn\u2019t given enough info to make that clear yet and the way the post reads leans more towards the former than the latter. \n\nAnd obviously if there is favoritism then I get OP\u2019s perspective.

Only now that we\u2019re adults is my cousin taking stock and things are improving since the competition was stupid) but I also wouldn\u2019t then turn around and harm people who where asking me about my interests or what was going on in my life. \n\nRegardless of it all OP shit on the situation and her uncle who was being nice.

At the very least, it's a huge milestone and rite of passage that deserves to be celebrated with the OP at the center.

OP needs to discuss their feelings of insecurity with someone and not take it out on family members.", "Doesn't sound like OP actively tried to talk to anyone. If they are always internalizing this and never communicating with others then it's a self-fulfilling feedback loop.\n\nThat being said I agree that there isn't enough details.

Is that something a lot of people do- not discuss an upcoming celebration at a current one?", "She needs to work on her jealousy and insecurities. Her sister\u2019s accomplishments aren\u2019t her failures. Like I said in another comment just enjoy having your friends and family all together.

OP is a *teen*! Uncle tried to do the right thing at the wrong time.  The best time to put out a fire is when a bucket full of water is needed, not a fire truck.

I think a lot of people are forgetting how few of us had control of our emotions at 18. \n\nI do think your uncle got caught in the crossfire when you, understandably, snapped in reaction to your hurt. I think you do owe him an apology, as it sounds like he was able see how much it was bothering you, and tried to redirect the conversation.\n\nLong term, you should consider therapy as that kind of family dynamic can follow you throughout your life. At 18, I get how it comes out sideways. When you are older, that excuse doesn\u2019t fly as much. Then you are an asshole", "No one will ever see this. but the majority of the responses are SO harsh!

And no, not every moment needed to be about the OP, but if the majority of the convo was about the sister, then she's right to feel some type of way about it. \n\nAs for everyone saying \"well at *my* graduation dinner a variety of subjects were discussed, nice! it's not usually the case that you're graduation is overshadowed by your sibling graduating from college or uni. \n\nOP - YTA to your uncle & NTA to everyone else.", "NTA. but you should apologise to your uncle", "**NTA**. shady for snapping at the uncle in particular, however less shady if he was also drooling all over your sister during your celebration and she has her own coming up. As an much older sibling myself who spent a large portion of childhood as the youngest cousin/sibling, the younger sibling needs to have their own sense of self celebrated just as much and feel valued in their own family. While i disagree with the YTA sentiment, I agree you may need to seek therapeutic help because even if the feelings are internal the external treatment from your family is what caused and compounded it. Otherwise I feel as though your family owes you an apology even if not for their outward actions but as parents who caused their child to feel inferior and letting your aunt do the same.\n\nJust remember time can give way to change. Make your feelings known and try to move accordingly. You're the star of your own story but everyone makes mistakes.", "NTA  I agree that snapping at your Uncle was a dick move but it was primarily your other family members fault for completely letting the whole thing escalate to that point. Apologize to your Uncle and make it up to him some how and that issue will be resolved since he cared to actually acknowledge you. As for the rest... I don't have enough info as to how they truly see you. But I would definitely try to stick by the Uncle.\n\nEdit: Never leave taking the low road out of the equation either. Plenty of opportunities to make things about you in return if they insist on making you miserable later on as well. Just make sure it's a bridge worth burning first.", "Its tough to say honestly. Personally I'd say NTA as a sibling who understands how you feel, but I think in retrospect you didn't have to snap at the uncle, it seems like he noticed how you felt. Maybe talking to your aunt about it or your parents in private could have helped, but with family dinners it makes it awkward to yell in front of everybody. Also, from what it sounds like your sister isn't necessarily against you, its more that she gets more attention. I totally get your frustration, I just would personally advise talking about your frustration in a private context rather than a family dinner.", "YTA. You snapped at the person who acknowledged you.", "YTA your uncle was trying to help you. Try reading some self-help books about managing your emotions and relationships with family.", "unpopular opinion but NTA. your graduation dinner should have been about you and your goals and plans. maybe it\u2019s because i would\u2019ve said the same thing. they spent almost all night talking about your sister and her plans and goals and then only when they were done, they wanted to talk about yours.", "NTA.  \n\n\nThe was OP's dinner to celebrate a major milestone in their life. The Aunt could have waited until after dinner to talk about the sister's new job but tactlessly brought it up during the meal.  \n\n\nSpeaking as a black sheep who has been upstaged at my own milestone celebrations, I can completely definitely relate to OP's feelings of hurt and frusteration.   \n\n\nTrue, perhaps OP shouldn't have blown up at the Uncle's attempt to difuse the situation but I think the rest of the family are lacking in empathy.", "NTA. It\u2019s very unfortunatly that you snapped at your uncle but the whole situation is unbelievable. It was supposed to be your day, it should have been about you! Your family discussing your sister is another level assholery! \n\nI want to believe that your uncle tried to divert the attention back to you, but you are right: why bother, for sure your family would have diverted their attention back to your sister very, very fast.\n\nYou finaly snapping is very understandable, however you should explain and appologize to your uncle in private as he seems to be the only somewhat resonable person there.\n\nBut you are most definatley NTA, despite what most of people here think.

I'm not sure why everyone's so eager to jump right to \"OP is 100% making this all up in her own head and reacting to absolutely nothing\".\n\nIt's kind of telling that after the dinner she got scolded for being rude, but it didn't occur to anyone to examine their own behavior and realize that maybe since sister is getting her own party in a few days, she doesn't need to monopolize OP's too?", "That my first thought too. I\u2019ve never had a celebration where people just talked about me all night.

He is owed an apology. Golden child spotlight and her parents were willing participants.", "And 100% believe the uncle understood why OP snapped.", "People have a good reason for YTA.

Inability to properly funnel your frustration and anger is not rarely a source of multitude of issues.", "Yeah of all the things to argue, it's pretty easy to know when you're the unfavoured family member. One of my aunts took every cousin on an overseas trip after graduating except me. Not exactly rocket surgery to figure out why.", "Wish I had an award for you. This is one of the oldest tricks in the book. Make it clear through every action that you think little of someone, but never do anything so big and direct they can call you out for it. It's a lose lose. \n\nA lot of the commenters are falling for it, too. It sounds like the problem isn't necessarily that OP needs to be the \"center of attention\" or whatnot. It sounds like she's had a life of being an afterthought. And of course it doesn't help that she doesn't seem to have the most socially cunning personality, and so she's not really articulating all of this in a way that gets sympathy.", "Except he was too damned late.  Right idea, but he should have done it earlier.  I\u2019ll bet he knows it, too.", "I'm so glad reddit didn't exist when I was 18 and asking for advice from a bunch of internet strangers where I would have seen a bunch of adults calling me an AH for being upset that my sister was getting all the glory at my graduation party after she already had her own the same week. Kindness is free. And yes inability to funnel your frustrations at 18 can stem from a multitude of issues not including crappy parents who value one kid over another and don't care about OP needs. Obviously we have very limited info and a potentially unreliable narrator but I have a kid her age and I sure hope if my kid asked a question he'd get at least one pearl of wisdom or actual life advice instead of a bunch of judgey comments.", "Yep. Took until I was 24 for my parents to do something blatant with their favoritism. 24! Meanwhile my cPTSD was real the whole time. \n\nIt seems to me that uncle\u2019s question should\u2019ve been answered at the very beginning of the dinner/celebration, or asked then. It\u2019s really interesting that it took until that far into the dinner for anyone to ask, and moreover, that no one seemed to have talked to the aunt/uncle about it but aunt seemed to know what questions to ask the other sister. \n\nI believe OP", ">And of course it doesn't help that she doesn't seem to have the most socially cunning personality, and so she's not really articulating all of this in a way that gets sympathy.\n\nRight? And I wonder who's responsible for that? Okay, no. No, I don't wonder. It's so sad. \n\nI hope she moves away for college and learns social skills and has a great life out from under her sister's shadow and her family's... whatever it is they feel about her. \n\nI'm jealous of those commenters who are falling for it, I admit. Instead, I think you and I might be in the same shit club full of people who learned about this stuff the hard way.", "She snapped at what was perceived as a pity question. She was ready to blow and she didn't think it was a sincere question because of....the entire rest of the gathering leading up to that point. Yeah, not a good look, and yes OP was an AH in that instance, but they earned that right. ESH except the uncle, which is what I've said before.", "OP is mediocre and wants to be celebrated as such. We all want our own parade, but call a spade a spade. Some people are naturally good at things and accomplishments get celebrated. Mediocrity does not.", "Yeah her insecurities.", "It's really telling that the comments are pretty much split between people who get it, and people who don't. This kind of behavior can be hard to see unless you're personally experienced it. I daresay many people, including those in this thread do what you described: they put down those who they think are unworthy, and will never admit it to even themselves because they'd rather believe they're a good person or that the recipient deserves it. I once met this girl who confessed that she asked her mentee a loaded question because \"she was feeling a little mean\". Of course, she only admitted this over a year later after she'd already said lots of bad things about her mentee.\n\nI'm seeing people calling OP \"narcissistic\" (what a reach) and \"melodramatic\". A lot of people have trouble sympathizing with victims who aren't cuddly and cute and perfectly injured. In fact many victims are insecure, liable to lash out, and many other things. (What else would you expect after years of bullshit?)\n\nI feel so, so sad for OP. I read some of their comments, and it's really clear they don't know how to communicate all of this in a way that expresses what the real problem is (and perhaps they don't even know). For example, their example where sister got a dinner after getting a track medal, but they got nothing. Obviously the issue isn't the dinner itself (I'd bet money on this); rather, it's probably lack of parental support. Like if my parents were so excited for my sister's track meets, and gave no fucks about mine and didn't even bother asking me how it went and how I felt, I'd probably notice and feel quite sad. (Which, given how awards-driven this family seems, this treatment feels quite likely.)\n\nBut the dinner feels more tangible than years of \"My mom rolled her eyes when I asked for a ride\" or \"My dad tuned me out when I told him I was trying for a new event,\" so it's easier to mention the dinner and then open the floor for \"WELL not ALL accomplishments are equal\" comments when that wasn't even the issue at all.", "Yeah, I agree. People have different strengths and weaknesses, and ONLY celebrating your kids for one exact strength and giving anyone who doesn't measure up no positive spotlight moments causes...exactly this. A child who feels like they're unloved and unwanted and like they don't matter as much as the kid you're always lifting up as the standard.\n\nIMO it's better to reward effort as a parent. As long as your kids are genuinely giving it their all, they do deserve praise and celebration for that. Not everyone is gonna get straight As or medals but if the kid poured themselves into it, isn't that worthy of celebrating as a parent?", "Nope.  The aunt asked about the sister\u2019s plans.  That\u2019s what pissed her off.  Clearly others did ask about her and she screamed at them for it.  See, having a celebration dinner where family gathers in your honor\u2026that\u2019s a celebration.  She\u2019s just pissed that they dared to also celebrate her sister, which is really crappy.", "Thank you! Everyone's acting as if she's 50 and lashed out. She's 18! \n\nyes, she owes her uncle an apology, but as you've said it's probably too little too late. \n\nCan I steal \"made of angst\". Ah the picture you've painted.", "Just my thoughts - \"But OP is just a TEENAGER. Their brains are still \"under construction\".

The family should notice and recognize the effort.\n\nNot sure the case here", "How would you feel if you were never mentioned?", "It absolutely makes sense that she was hurt. Her pain is understandable but to me seems to stem from her inferiority complex rather than anything tangible the family has done. She is 18 so there's enough self-responsibility there in how she carries and communicates herself. Rude responses have their place but I don't think this was it.\n\nBased off what was given I found nothing about the family alarming and the uncle starting a new conversation for her suggests emotional maturity and ample time for OP to still have her place during the meal.", "I'd be curious how the straight A daughter reacts when the straight B daughter gets the same reward as her. We also don't know what sacrifices each daughter made for their achievements. Was OP studying/working as hard? Was she attending track practice as consistently?", "That's literally I said. The parents should've rewarded ops hard work to encourage her.\n\nAlso just because that's how it was for you, doesn't mean that's how it is for ops sister.\n\nsomebody getting Bs should not have a reward equal to somebody getting As.

Gotta have a backbone at some point. Usually when you get a backbone is the same time people think you\u2019re an A H. very convenient.\n\nBackbone would be OP interrupting aunt and saying that sisters party is later.\n\nOP snapping at their uncle is the same as yelling at a regular store employee because corporate set the prices too high. It makes no sense, and OP is just an AH with no backbone.", "I guarantee OP was mentioned. You have to remember that this is Reddit. If OP is in the wrong, they usually leave out the things that make them look bad. They don\u2019t actually come here for advice.

Good parenting would mean rewarding your child for hard work in the way that they would find most receptive. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t get a full dinner to celebrate a track time, but gets to choose a special dessert outing for the family. Maybe she doesn\u2019t get rewarded for her b grades specifically, but her parents talk kindly about how proud they are that she got a B in English when she was struggling to improve her essays. \n\nParenting is being thoughtful to your child\u2019s struggles and celebrating their achievements in a way that helps them, and these parents suck at that.", "Probably just an issue that the older sister is more of an adult now so the relatives can relate to her more than the younger sister, so the conversation naturally gets steered in that direction. No real intent to slight the younger sister but, well, most of the time these situations happen *because* people are neglecting someone.

It distorts the importance so nobody can argue with your point. But your point is not the original situation, it\u2019s not weddings where the bride is spending hours planning and thousands of dollars for a huge event only to have her sister\u2019s wedding oddly happen around the same time, it\u2019s two graduations happening during graduation season one high school one college - college being arguably more significant.", "Terrible Analogy, I'll give you a better one\n\nDiscussing the sister's wedding(a few days after it happened)at OP's engagement dinner that they moved up bc relativeswere in town.\n\n\nYou seem to  be forgetting(or maybe just ignoring) that the reason that the extended family came to town is because of the sisters graduation.

Not what you said, but the way the family has approached this. They're willing to celebrate the sister but OP has to share a celebration? The whole family is willing to come down for the sister, but not OP? Thats how I'm reading that. And seeing as how celebrating finishing highschool seems to be seen as normal by OP, its pretty safe to assume sister had a celebration when she finished high school too. Only she didn't have to share. At this point I'd honestly not be surprised if when OP graduates college, they have to share a celebration with their sister because she happened to get engaged or something.", "I think you were the AH to your uncle but not the situation.

NTA for feeling the bitterness that prompted your outburst.\n\nSome people here have very obviously never had to deal with the toxicity of nonstop comparisons by family and it shows. OP is not immature for feeling bitter. OP is not selfish or unjustified in his wish to be appreciated. Being treated as a clear \u201csecondhand\u201d child really, really grinds you down mentally and imo could almost be classified as a soft form of psychological abuse. It\u2019s no joking matter that can be brushed aside with a stale piece of \u201coh just grow up!\u201d advice. By always having your accomplishments overshadowed or outright ignored, it sends a message that you\u2019re inadequate, you\u2019re not good enough, you\u2019re unimportant. It often gets to a point where the child feels unmotivated to do anything, because anything they do will be overlooked, so why bother? It\u2019s a road to depression and self loathing and it\u2019s an awful, awful thing to have to put a child or developing adult through.\n\nThat being said, the uncle was the good guy in this picture.

The pent up emotion and on top of the suppression from your family made you blow up and snap.\n\nIt's frustrating but I believe soft YTA because I don't think you meant to be the asshole but wanted some recognition. But the lashing towards your uncle in this case does make you the asshole. You don't need the acceptance of everyone, just one person is enough and in this case talking about your future and college ambitions with your uncle is meaningful enough.

As for the rest of your family, I'd explain you are sorry to your uncle for snapping on him specifically when he was trying to help but you won't apologize for feeling neglected when they spent your entire graduation dinner asking about your sister instead of you. \n\nYou can be sorry for snapping at your uncle but not for feeling underappreciated by your family. Apologizing for a poor reaction to something is mature, but apologizing for feeling upset in the first place only invalidates your own emotions.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes families don't notice when their dynamic causes pain to a member of them and need it to be pointed out to them, which is not okay but something that has to be dealt with.

It was like a 2 year thing and mostly, because we lived in different states, just when we where home for break. \n\nNow we\u2019re really close and have worked through that. But I remember being really confused and worried that she wouldn\u2019t want to have a relationship with me. My mom said something really smart. My whole life I\u2019ve always had to trail ahead. My sisters whole life she\u2019s been my mini me, the second one, the one who had to live up to my example or deal with being in the shadow of it. For a long time I was her idol because I was her big sister. But when she hit around 18 it was suddenly on her to forge ahead without me leading the charge and she also needed to create an identity outside of being my little sister. It didn\u2019t help we look really really similar.\n\nMaybe this is a situation where OP is just really angsty and is working on establishing who they are outside of who their sister is or was?

Perhaps OP isn't the best at articulating her feelings yet and thus can't convince people her family basically favors her sister to her own detriment, but anyone who's been through this kind of \"putting you down through microaggressions and then yelling at you when you express displeasure\" can read between the lines.", "Right.

Which I think is a horrible way to treat people, but that's just my opinion. \n\nConcerning the dinner that's theoretically about her, her aunt was talking to the sister, as you said. But that led to \"the whole rest of the dinner was talking about my sister... It might as well have been a celebration for her\".

I struggled with it too. Your hurt is justified. Your fixation on cataloguing every single time your sister gets attention is only making you hurt worse. Your lashing out at your uncle was not the way to address your feelings. He deserves a sincere apology.\n\nThe rest of your family suck too.
