So, was this dinner only about your graduation? Or maybe about both graduations, yours and your sisters\u2019?\n\nAlso, I think the whole point here is not this dinner by itself, but a collection of moments where you\u2019ve felt like this\u2026", "Soft YTA because your uncle was the one who tried to engage you.  But damn if it doesn't hurt to be overshadowed on big days by your siblings.  My parents almost missed my high school graduation bc my sister had state track. She was a sophomore, and would end up going to state like five more times in different sports.  It hurt to set up my own party, and then to hear stories of how amazing my sister was on the day that was supposed to celebrate me.  \n\nI have carried the idea that she's better than me for more decades than I want to admit.  It's been toxic for my relationship to my mom and sister.  I hope you can find a way to talk about it either with them, or with a therapist.", "ESH Everyone except your uncle\n\nYou shouldn't have yelled at him, he was just trying to help (although I do think you're the least asshole-ish out of all the assholes here)\n\nEveryone else could've let the spotlight be on you for once", "YTA you were upset with your aunt but took it out on your uncle.", "YTA Your uncle was trying to make sure your accomplishments were being recognized too and you snapped at him. You feel insecure. That\u2019s no one else\u2019s problem than yours.", "INFO\n\nWe need more context\n\nCan you describe other instances where you family has favored your sister over you\n\nBecause if this was a one off occurrence, then your response was over the top.\n\nIf this was another in a long line of slights...then I think you will find that people are more supportive of your feelings", "YTA for getting mad at the one person taking an interest in you and including you. i understand the situation is complicated but taking it out on him wasn't the best move. it may be worth considering discussing how you feel with your parents if they'd be open to that and you could potentially do something to celebrate just you and your achievement of this milestone.", "OP, YTA. Not because everyone was talking about your sister and you got angry, but because you snapped at your uncle when he was asking about you. The man probably realized you were (respectfully) upset and asked you what your plans are just to engage you in the conversation and you snapped at him.", "YTA for taking your anger out on your uncle, who was trying to make it about you. You owe him an apology.", "YTA for snapping at someone actually asking you about you. I get that you were frustrated that they talked about your sister at the dinner for you (I would be too if I was feeling like I was in her shadow as much as you seem to!) but being rude is still being rude. Especially when someone is taking an interest in you.", "YTA, but it's not surprising you lost your temper. The problem is you lost it with the wrong person. You, when you're feeling calmer, need to talk to your parents about your feelings", "YTA\n\n\nYour uncle was trying g to engage you, and you snapped at him. That\u2019s super rude. Also, since your family was down for your sister\u2019s graduation, was this really *your* graduation dinner, or was it for both of you?", "INFO \nYou said your sister also graduated was this for both of you? \n\nIs your uncle truly the only one who asked about you at the dinner? Or did the dinner start focused on you and then your aunt asked about your sister?", "NTA.  This is a sore spot for you and your resentment didn\u2019t just flare up.  My guess is that this is one of many times ppl have focused on your sister and not you", "YTA You can\u2019t expect people to only talk about you at your celebration. Also, you totally misdirected your anger. You attacked the person who did show interest.", "Yikes! You let your emotions get the best of you. Just a mistake. Not the end of the world. Learn from it. \n\nYour response was very immature. Your uncle was trying to include you in the conversation. Instead of taking the opportunity to make the conversation about you ... you blew it. It\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish! You had the chance to turn this whole dinner around & make it all about you. \n\nSorry kiddo but YTA", "YTA. I understand why you'd be frustrated, but your uncle was just trying to engage with you and ask about your future plans. He didn't deserve to be the subject of your ire.\n\nYou don't have to be the same as your sister. You don't have to impress anyone, whether they're family or not. You DO have to take ownership of your own life, and treat others with some basic human decency. Especially the people who did nothing to wrong you (like your uncle). It's okay to say something in a situation like this, but it has to be done the right way. Not by snapping at someone who had nothing to do with your anger.", "YTA. Your uncle asked you a question about you and you threw a hissy fit. You ruined your own celebration with your attitude. \n\nYou may want to consider therapy for the level of resentment you feel toward your sister.", "YTA for snapping at them, especially your uncle who was clearly interested in your future plans. But as the younger sister to a very impressive older sister, I 100% understand your feelings. Next time, take the opportunity to share your accomplishments and let people celebrate you!", "Well... people are allowed to talk to other persons, not just the person the celebration is about.\n\nAnd people will tend to ask you less questions if you yell at them when they do.\n\nYTA.", "NTA. You're young and it is hurtful to feel like you're always being overlooked for your older sister. Of course, lashing out wasn't ideal or the most mature thing to do, but it's super normal and understandable. I do think you should apologize, but I don't think refusing to apologize makes you an AH since you're feeling unseen and overlooked and those feelings are just as deserving and worthy of acknowledgment as your family feeling disrespected because you snapped at them.\n\nI'm sorry you're feeling like your family is picking favorites. Please know that everyone is smart and worthy in different ways and that life is never a competition between you and your siblings. You will be there for each other in good and bad times, and it is important to celebrate those wins and be grateful that you have each other. Don't worry about the Bs - your life is just beginning and you are going to do and experience so many amazing things.", "YTA. You lashed out at the only person trying to turn the dinner around to focus on you. I get your frustration, it's totally understandable, but also very much misplaced.", "YTA. No one is allowed to ask about other people while your around? Your family was was in town for her graduation too. You were also being asked questions but snapped so that\u2019s on you.", "YTA. I get that you might feel slighted, but it sounds like some of this is your own doing. \n>No one every says it but I know they prefer her to me.\n\nHow do you know that if no one has ever said it?\n\n>My uncle asked me about if I am going to college and I snapped at him\n\nSo someone asks about you and you get mad? That's not a rational reaction. \n\nSounds like you need to work through some of your own feelings and stop blaming other people.", "YTA. We all at times feel like we are in our siblings shadows, however your family is allowed to talk about your sister and other topics at dinner, a graduation dinner or even birthday dinner doesnt mean the conversation can only revolve around that specific person. Also your uncle asked a common question asked to high school grads and you bit his head off for it", "ESH \n\nHave you ever considered being rude to people thst actually deserve it? You know like your aunt? If you need to shout, and even curse, but on people that has made you do it.", "NTA. If you do apologize, do so only for your behavior, not for how you felt.", "OP you are NTA but you\u2019ll be the asshole to yourself if you don\u2019t cut them all off.  They\u2019re toxic as hell.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

In our heads we think \u201cwell this isn\u2019t fair and surely they\u2019ll be sorry when I call it out\u201d but sulking and then snapping doesn\u2019t win anyone over. Anyone who was trying to focus on you will feel like you bit their head off (uncle) and the people who possibly do favor your sister will just think you\u2019re a brat and feel justified. Basically, you make yourself look bad. I am mortified as an adult when I think back to incidents like this when I was so sure that people must be seeing how poorly I was being treated while I frowned and sighed and answered shortly if people tried to talk to me. But really they just saw an angry teenager at the table who was ruining the meal for everyone else who knew how to behave.", "YTA for snapping at your uncle when he was trying to engage you in conversation. Your parents are also TA for roping your graduation dinner onto your sister's. Even though both of your graduate close together hers was 1st. She deserves to be celebrated for that. You also deserve your own celebration for graduating from HS and that should have been done separately so neither of you would have to share the spotlight.", "She has a party this weekend, with other friends and family. This was suppose to be just my celebration", "Agreed. I can understand why you felt like you were being swept under the rug. But it sounds like your uncle was trying to adjust the spotlight back to you. He did not deserve to be snapped at.", "Right, Why would op try to take it with uncle when he is the only one who tried to support them.", "Exactly. Was there another celebration that WAS about sister? If not, it\u2019s pretty reasonable that people were celebrating both of you, especially if sis already graduated and you haven\u2019t yet. Also, OP won\u2019t want to hear this, but a college graduation is more exciting than HS, especially since sister has a new job and OP seemingly has no plan post high school. What exactly are they supposed to talk about if they can\u2019t ask about OP\u2019s future plans?", "> You can\u2019t expect people to only talk about you at your celebration. \n\nYeah well it sounds like the majority of the time the conversation revolved around OP's sister...just like every single family gathering that OP has ever had. Now OP has finally graduated from high school, possibly OP's major achievement in a number of years, and has a graduation dinner to celebrate.\n\nBut OP's graduation dinner is STILL ABOUT THE SISTER.\n\nI see why OP blew up. It's the straw that broke the camel's back. It's the \"when is it going to be about me\". OP is very understandably hurt and feeling blindsided", ">Your response was very immature. \n\nAgreed, but OP is indeed just a high school graduate. \n\nWith the background that OP has felt overshadowed by her sister all her life, and with her sister being the topic of conversation for the entire graduation dinner **for OP**, I'm not surprised that OP blew up.\n\nOP's family (including sister) are the assholes for not recognising that they should be celebrating OP for once. Looks like they're just used to ignoring OP and showering their love and praise on the golden child instead.", ">No one is allowed to ask about other people while your around? \n\nUmm did you read the post\n\n>We were at dinner and my aunt started to ask about my sisters job she got out of college. **The whole rest of dinner was talking about my sister, what she is gonna do and so on. It might as well been a celebration for her.**", "What did the uncle do? OP literally yelled at the only person who showed interest in talking about them", "\u2026. Was your whole family only supposed to talk\nabout you all night? Is that what you think happens at graduation dinners?", "It might be hard to see it from your perspective now, but I promise you, the best way forward from an upbringing like this is to own your own life as best as you can. There is nothing about your sister that is \"better\" than you. Instead of focusing on your family's attention to your sister, focus on the things that make YOU amazing and special. Focus on what you want to do with your life, and find joy in that. What do you like? What are your hobbies? What are your strengths? Figure out what gives you meaning in your own life, and go after it!\n\nYour family might not see your value immediately, but they will see it eventually. And if they don't, fuck them. Live your life for yourself. Wish you the best.", "Because OP was hurt and blew up when someone finally turned the topic of conversation back to her. It's not about blowing up at uncle, it's that there probably wasn't any previous opening in the conversation for OP to speak. \n\nWe are talking about a hurt and frustrated teenager here who just blew up after years of feeling sidelined. While she should definitely learn skills of how to turn the conversation back to herself, we should not ignore the background of this incident that broke the camel's back.\n\nESH (especially OP's parents and sister)", "It read to me like this was a dinner for both of them, since they work combining the celebrations for both graduations.", "Honestly, what did any of them do? This was a dinner for both her sister and her. Her insecurities do not necessarily mean that anybody else is doing anything wrong at all.", "The impression OP has created is that the question was asked in an insulting way.", "Yep, totally agree...... Like are they only supposed to talk about her all night?", "Can you quote me where the OP said that the uncle implied that?", "where did you get that from? that's a big assumption.", "> The whole rest of dinner was talking about my sister, what she is gonna do and so on.  It might as well been a celebration for her.\n\nThe entire family didn\u2019t give one ounce of care for OP, just as they have been showing for OP\u2019s entire life."]}
