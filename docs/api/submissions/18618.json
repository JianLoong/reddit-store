Please know that everyone is smart and worthy in different ways and that life is never a competition between you and your siblings.

Anyone who was trying to focus on you will feel like you bit their head off (uncle) and the people who possibly do favor your sister will just think you\u2019re a brat and feel justified. Basically, you make yourself look bad. I am mortified as an adult when I think back to incidents like this when I was so sure that people must be seeing how poorly I was being treated while I frowned and sighed and answered shortly if people tried to talk to me.

No one knows what the future holds and you don't know how you or her will turn out.", "NTA, but it's still not great on any end. \n\nYour family should obviously be able to support you without making it about your sister, and should recognize you too, but from your description it seems like your uncle was trying to do just that. \n\nYou shouldn't have snapped at him, but I don't think you're as unjustified in your annoyance as some other people on this thread will say. Being less \"good\" than a sibling is NEVER the other siblings fault, it's just luck.\n\nAnd yeah, family woll treat you unfairly because of that, will make you feel unwanted and unimportant, even if it sucks. The best thing you can do is make them understand _that you feel this way_ and why that is hurting you.\n\nBeing mean to them feels good, yeah. They've been mean to you. But being mean won't make it better. Giving them a good and clear chance to understand your viewpoint and feelings is the best that's doable.\n\nAnd if that also doesn't work, screw em. Nobody should be put down because others are better then them. If they blame you for being yourself, that's on them.", "NTA this was your graduation party not your sisters and yet they made it all about her. I find it very disrespectful and I'd be very angry as well. Your uncle asked you that to know if you were going to follow your \"perfect sister's steps\", it has happened to me in my family as well. I had the perfect aunt; everything was about her and when I told them a was going to university, they told me they hope I would achieve the same as her and she could help me because she knew a lot about everything. But later they realized she wasn't so perfect and half of my family end up hating her. So happy ending. :)", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have snapped at your uncle if I were you I\u2019d at least apologize to him and explain that it wasn\u2019t on him, it\u2019s just the accumulation of everyone only talking about your sister was a bit much for you and that you are sorry it came out on him.", "NTA. From all your comments, I understand your frustration and your young, which isn't a bad thing. You shouldn't have blown up on your uncle but your still young and emotional blow ups happen.

He wanted to talk about you... but you didn't allow for that to happen. You were in your own head, stewing and getting mad instead.\n\nHow much of this is objectively true? \n\nYOU say her grades make her \"better\" than you... But your parents have not said this? You may be creating your own hell here, with your insecurities and feeling of inferiority... If your parents have not said this to you, then you may be creating this reality nside your head and living it, and denying yourself from enjoying being with your family.\n\nYou're young, and at this age, you really need to be brave and share your feelings with your family. They can't read your mind, so they can't know what will trigger a nasty response like your poor uncle got.\n\nYou may be doing yourself a huge disservice here by believing something that isn't true. Talk to your family. Let them know that you're hurting, and need some one on one time with them, and for them to acknowledge nad praise your accomplsihments too.  Getting a therapist isn't a bad idea too to be able to work through these big emotions you're carrying around.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you've been marginalized and ignored. Your family should be ashamed.

But....  I'll put it like this.  I have 2 kids, they fight  constantly and when one is slighted they retaliate making both of them the asshole.  There really isn't any mediation at that point they're both wrong and they're both justified. They just gotta walk away.  That's what you got here, both sides being the ahole. They didn't handle you well and you have been sitting on this too long making it a bigger issue that came to a head. Maybe you should confront your parents when you can find some rationale and lay your feelings about things on the table.

Make sure your hitting the right target when you go to make a point.", "Gentle YTA because your uncle seemed to be well-intentioned. Your parents should've been more understanding.\n\nHere's my insight as an overshadowed sibling to another. I know very well that it's tough but life isn't all about academic grades. I hope you keep exploring new hobbies and find something you're really good at to help you build self-love. There will always be someone who's better than you, and it's a hard pill to swallow, but remember that it doesn't always have to be a competition. It's not your sister's fault that she's a high achiever, but you should learn to focus on yourself and be satisfied with your own achievement. If you feel that your family members are making things worse by showing blatant favoritism, you can choose distance yourself from the toxicity.\n\nGood luck OP!", "NTA. I don\u2019t wanna say you\u2019re TA bc I have the PERFECT older sister. Literally. And I get it, it sucked to be in their shadow by whole life. I saw her as prettier, smarter, more popular, she traveled the whole world and knows multiple languages, literally one of those people everyone knows about in our town. I was always XYZ\u2019s sister. But, I\u2019ve learned that my sister is so like able bc she really is amazing and I\u2019m grateful to have her. I\u2019ve accepted myself as more quiet and not as smart as her, BUT I have amazing qualities she doesn\u2019t have either! We\u2019re different people but valuable in different ways. I suggest you make a list of great qualities you have that highlight who you are. You are not your sister, you don\u2019t need to be similar to her. And sometimes people give attention to people who are more extroverted, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t think you\u2019re amazing as well. People love a kind person, tap into that and become THAT person. You can become the super kind person, the generous person, the one people can rely on for secrets and support. Any sort of quality, feel it deeply and act on it and that become what people know you as and you will gather positive attention too.", "Esh, please apologize to your uncle. He acknowledged that the dinner was about you and you acted rudely.", "It does sound like your parents and aunt tend to focus on your sister. (Is your aunt - not the uncle - the sibling of one of your parents?) It seems like your uncle was returning the spotlight to you, and you lashed out at him of all people.\n\nMaybe you should apologize to HIM for that and possibly use the conversation to also ask him if he sees that dynamic in your family - that all the focus and praise is on your sister. He may see it, too and be able to talk with you about.\n\nIf you are going off to college, you have a chance to do your own thing with no sister-shadow in sight. Enjoy that. While you may have a legitimate hurt and disappointment with your family, you don't want to let that become a boulder-size chip on your shoulder that spoils your relationships with other, completely innocent people.\n\nCongrats on graduating HS! and good wishes to you for the new adventures you have in store!", "NTA.

From what I\u2019ve read in your post I understand exactly what you mean by \u201cNo one says it but I know they prefer her to me.\u201d People are commenting that this shows insecurity but in my own experience my parents would favor my sister in so many ways such as not celebrating my achievements as much, punishing my sister much less harshly compared to me when we both acted up, showing more interests in my sisters interests compared to me, but they would have never said anything like they preferred my sister. I could definitely see myself doing something like this if I was in your scenario, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for it. After growing up and talking to my parents about how my childhood made me feel, they did admit that they treated me unfairly. I hope that it gets better for you soon!", "You\u2019re a kid so your emotional response is justified. But to add perspective, not a competition. Life isn\u2019t a completion.

You have not seen where life takes you OR your sister, and yet you're already setting yourself up for a lifetime of disappointment and failure. Let me give you a few tidbits to help you along:  \n\\- Every family gathering, regardless of the reason, is a reason to celebrate anyone and everyone. Consider any event like this to be about catching up and having a family reunion. It becomes funerals and weddings, and if you have a tight family, you will miss these moments and it becomes just funerals.  \n\\- Grades, degrees, and diplomas are utterly meaningless. What matters is how you apply yourself and the goals you set for yourself. Plenty of people didn't finish school and went on to successful careers doing something they love and are passionate about. Plenty of people finished school with straight A's and work small jobs living paycheck to paycheck. Your B doesn't define who you are and your sister's A doesn't define who she is. Be yourself and don't spend your time comparing yourself. It's a waste of that time you should be using to enjoy your young life AND focus on you and what YOU want to do. That is all that matters.  \n\\- That's it. Life is simple. The world is your oyster as people say. It truly is. Figure out what you want to do and what you need to do to get there. Work hard for it. I was a C+ average in Undergrad because I just didn't want to be there. I went back for an MBA later in life and was President's List the whole time because the motivation changed.

My little brother looks a lot like my dad, but has his mother\u2019s eyes. He had finished high school but hadn\u2019t  gone to post secondary yet.

There's two issues here.  The first is insecurity over how your family view you.  I suspect this is just a matter of your sister being older and thus hitting bigger milestone first.  But they're clearly not devaluing you. Your family had a dinner specifically to celebrate your graduation.  Whilst you certainly do deserve to celebrate the milestone it's not reasonable for you to expect the family getting together to avoid talking about your sister's accomplishment and what she's planning to do next.  She has had a major achievement.  It doesn't really matter that you're having a dedicated celebration later that week, given the time of year presumably this is the first time they've had a chance to catch up with her and are excited to hear her news.  You clearly weren't forgotten or left out at your own celebration as your outburst is specifically in response to your uncle turning the conversation back to you.  In other words, a normal dinner party conversation.  I've never been to a celebratory event (family or otherwise) where we talked exclusively about the guest of honor. \n\nThe second issue you should also consider: high school graduation is laudable, well done, however, it's also expected, it's a baseline standard or proof that you can understand your countries local language, do simple maths and that you have a common understanding of the variety of other things you're taught at school.  It's really only notable if you fail (whether it's your fault or those that failed to support you).  Most people will be happy for you in much the same way as a birthday etc.  A college graduation is a rather bigger deal, it's become much more common but proportionately you're still talking about \\~20-25% of people in most western countries if that.  Once you've gotten past the initial congratulations what do you expect people to do for you?\n\nYou were given an event, people celebrated you, asked you about your plans etc.  You got the accolades you deserved, you're just out of touch with your situation.", "Apology to ur uncle and that\u2019s it I say he\u2019s a g", "I have two daughters.

She can also be difficult to talk to, because she gets defensive over just about anything. I always speak very carefully to her. \n\nI can be easier with my younger daughter, she's much more laid back. \n\nBut I love them both with everything I am. I celebrate both of their unique talents. \n\nAs a teacher, I always thought I'd be very disappointed if either girl refused higher education. I surprised myself by realizing it didn't matter, and older daughter can always go to college later in life if she so wishes. \n\nBut neither is lesser in my eyes. \n\nI'm sure that the same is true in your family, you just can't see it.

Even when talking about their grades, OP doesn't say that her family would use her sister as an example of a better student or anything like that.

Just bc a party is centered around someone, that doesn't mean they're the only thing you can talk about it. Graduations, birthdays, weddings, etc-ppl don't spend the whole time only talking about or to the guest of honor.

Did no one acknowledge OP?? Or was this just like every other family gathering where people catch up with each other? \n\nAs an event planner I have been at hundreds of events & celebrations. People have conversations about everything under the sun. I have never been at any event where the only topic was one person... \n\nWhen was the last time you attended a birthday party & only talked about the person celebrating their birthday?", "You don\u2019t throw parades for a .500 team\u2026", "Your opinion is valid and I completely respect it.  I hope you realize that.\n\nThe only problem I have with it is that this was supposed to be a dinner for OP\u2019s graduation and the entire family turned the conversation from OP to the sister.  This isn\u2019t a one-time occurrence either.  OP\u2019s mental health would benefit greatly from going NC with all of them.", "In other words, you\u2019re biased against OP. A good sister and parents would have shifted the conversation to being about OP. They didn\u2019t for a reason.", "And apparently you don\u2019t celebrate a child\u2019s accomplishments at their own graduation either. Again, don\u2019t have kids.", "Yeah but that doesn't excuse OP for lashing out at someone trying to include them\nImo the anger is misplaced", "Or I'mm speaking from experience? I've never been to a graduation/birthday party where the guest of honor was the *only* person ppl talked about. Everyone usually had their fair share of life details to give. I don't really know any family or friend group that can spend hours talking about just one person.", "Could OP have handled it better?  Sure.  Every situation given to us Redditors can be handled better.  But am I going to call OP the asshole here?  Absolutely not.", "Or I\u2019m speaking from my experience as the straight A student. The conversation should have been redirected to OP. I would be pissed if I was at a celebration for a sibling and they all talked about me, and yes I\u2019ve been at family celebrations where the conversation has centered on someone else\u2019s accomplishments.  OP earned her time to shine, sis had it in a week.  I\u2019ve redirected conversations several times off of me, because it\u2019s someone else\u2019s accomplishment.  So I\u2019m going with ESH. Glad you have family that never does this, but I\u2019ve seen extended family do the opposite.", "\u201cWe were at dinner and my Aunt started to ask about my sisters job she got out of college. The whole rest of the dinner was talking about my sister, what shes gonna do and so on.\u201d In other words, we have no idication that anyone talked about OP at all. If you want to ask that question, ask it. However, sister is getting her own party in a week, so people should focus on the person being celebrated. Focus is the key word. Not the entire conversation but at least the majority.", "You're entitled to your opinion and i respect that\nAgree to disagree"]}
