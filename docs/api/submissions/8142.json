I (27M) went to a restaurant with my brother (22) as well as my daughter (5). We haven' t seen each other in a while so we wanted to talk there and took my daughter with me because she loves her uncle which he does too. Neither did I invite him nor he me so he would pay for him and I for my daughter andmyself.\nI normally don't spend much on food so I wanted to treat myself a little and ordered something with lobster which wasn't all too cheap. My brother ordered something with pasta which was cheaper I suppose if it's important. As my daughter can't really read yet I listed some of the things I knew she'd like from the menu. I decided before I did so and told my brother what it was because he asked me about it. After I listed my daughter the dishes she said that she wanted to have the same I had and I refused right away. When she asked why I told her something along the lines of \"It's too expensive to order it for you too. Plus you wouldn't appreciate it anyway and won't eat up. In ten years or so we can talk about it again. We could get a small lasagna for you. You like lasagna\" My daughter refused to decide for anything else so in the end I just ordered the lasagna for her. My brother called me an AH for saying that my daughter wouldn't appreciate it because of her age. I didn't respond to it and just sighed as I didn't want it to escalate into a fight. The mood was quite tense from that moment on and my daughter wouldn't stop pouting, even refusing to eat her lasagna until I told her that she wouldn't get anything else at home for a couple of hours. \nWhen I got home my husband asked why our daughter was so grumpy so I told him what was up. He doesn't really like my brother which is why he didn't want to come along for anyone wondering. He didn't neccessarily agree nor disagree with my decision per se but thinks I shouldn't have directly told our daughter that because she wouldn't be grumpy and pouty now. \n\nI'd just like to have some opinions from people outside the situation and my close ones. I don't think I'm the AH but my brother does so maybe someone can explain his views to me if you share them?\nSo- AITA?", "created_utc": 1674556982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k2odx/aita_for_refusing_to_order_lobster_for_my_5_year/", "score": 1554, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I totally get not wanting to order her an adult size portion of lobster. But instead of encouraging your kid to try new things you decided for her that she should be a picky kid. As others mentioned, why not share some and get lasagna as a back up? I do this with my kid all the time (who happens to love lobster). And then bribing a kid to eat just rubs me the wrong way. Food is not a manipulation tactic, it\u2019s to be enjoyed and keep us nourished.", "You're N T A for not ordering it for her right out of the bat, however, YTA for not giving it some of yours to try and telling her she won't appreciate it. \"Sweetheart, is really expensive right now to buy you this dish since you've never tried it before and you may not like it, how about we get you the lasagna, which you do like and I'll share some of my dish for you to try and see if you like it? If you like it then next time we could probably get you some for yourself\" \n\nWhen I was growing up, my mom would NEVER buy me something at a restaurant that I never tried before because in her own words \"I'm not wasting my money on something you won't like\" she would also never share what she got with me because she was sure \"I wouldn't like it\" so I never really learned to eat sooooo many things and was qualified as a \"picky eater\" by everyone because it was easier for my mom to get me chicken nuggets and fries then let me try new things even if just a bite from her plate. \nNow as an adult, I've had to fix my relationship with food and force myself to learn to eat like an adult and not like a child. Luckily for me I have a husband who eats everything and now is much better for me, I've expanded my palate, I've learned to eat/cook more things and after years of this I can finally say - that I was never a picky eater, I was just highly restricted by my parents.\n\nEdit to add: I have my own kid now (he turns 6 today actually) and I let him try from mine and his father's plate whenever we eat something he's never had and he loves shrimp, scallops, most types of fish he's tried and he absolutely loves his veggies. So my advice is not to buy the whole thing right away, just let your kid try it. Teach them to eat good now and you won't end up with a \"picky\" teen/adult.", "YTA entirely for how you handled this.\n\nYeah, buying an expensive lobster meal for a 5 year old is unsustainable. Yeah, it sucks paying for shit your kids claim to want and then don\u2019t even try and eat and it wrecks me watching it go to waste too.\n\nYou could easily have shared some of your meal with your child, and let her have lasagne as a fallback.

It's a great way to introduce kids to new flavours and broad tastes as a kid is always a good thing", "NTA I understand being conservative with your money especially when you have no idea if she'd like it. But, you could have let her try yours. When my eldest was 5 years old she  loved lobster. Now she definitely didn't get it often, but when we would go on cruises I refused the kids menu for her and let her order off the adult menu. I think that this helped her, in part, develop a varied and adventurous palate.", "You have a 5 year old child and sound like someone without children to me. \n\n\nYTA not for not ordering lobster but for how you handled absolutly everything about this. \n\n\nWould you not be insulted if someone would tell you good food would be wasted on you? Why do you expect your child to react any different? \n\n\nThere are multiple easy ways to say no without insulting your child.\n\n\n\"You never had this, rather order something you know you like. \" is such a basic parents response. Even the \"it is spicy\" lie is better as this.\n\n\nJust deciding it will be lasagne and she has to eat it should also be the absolut last resort.

While the explanation may have gone over better if you\u2019d left out the part about your daughter being unable to appreciate it, what it ultimately comes down to is that you weren\u2019t financially comfortable paying for two lobster meals. That\u2019s enough of a reason and beyond that, your brother has no right to second guess your parenting. Also, not everyone likes lobster, so unless you know your child would\u2019ve eaten her dinner, it easily could\u2019ve ended up wasted. I think you could\u2019ve handled it better by promising to let her try a piece if she compromised and accepted the lasagna so she wouldn\u2019t have felt \u201cleft out\u201d but that\u2019s your call as a parent. \n\nFwiw, though, children that age absolutely can appreciate the taste of lobster even if they don\u2019t understand the luxury nature of it.

You could have handled it better, for example \"this dish has lobster in it and not everyone likes lobster and you haven't tried it before. Let's get you lasagne because it's definitely delicious and you can try some of mine this time\".

Hopefully by the time the good comes she will forget about it, or worst case she tries a bite and likes it and forgets about it the next time you go to the restaurant because she still can\u2019t read.

To your daughter, it just sounds like you said she\u2019s some second class citizen because of her age.  YTA and have no tact.", "Not the AH for not ordering her own.

See, the child is a person as well. You treated her like she was less worthy because she\u2019s a kid. You chose to bring her to the restaurant.

I'm looking at the kids menu for the lobster shack I had lunch at - the kids menu options are hot dog, mac and cheese, PB&J, ham and cheese sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, or grilled cheese.

However, you could have shared a bite or 2 with your child, seeing if your child would like lobster.  If the child did not, then you would not be out anything except a bite of the food, and the child would probably had eaten and it would be ok.  You could have also chosen to order something else, that is not as expensive.   \n\nThis I believe is a mistake.  You sent her several messages right then and there, along with after all revolving around food.  The first is that you are always going to go cheap on food when it comes to her.  She may not have the concept of money, but a good chance that somewhere in her mind, that any food that you get her will be of lesser value than what you eat.  That she can choose not to eat if she does not like it.  And a bit more on how you will make her suffer for it.\n\nMany issues with food starts with the parents and a young age.  It does not take much to plant those seeds at all, and once they are it is a real pain to get rid of.  \n\nRight now your child is 5, and you can hope that she forgets about this and nothing comes of it, or it could escalate and have undesirable problems later on.\n\nI once knew 2 children who had eating disorders.  They learned at home, from a very early age on how to get out of eating what they did not want to, they could force themselves to vomit.  This was due to the parents behavior and actions.  \n\nI have also known a few children, who were not much older than your child, starve themselves all cause they did not like the food, or did not get what they wanted, and ended up having to go to the hospital for medical issues.  \n\nWhen I was growing up, my parents did eat different things, and if they had something that I wanted, and they were not sure if I would like it, would tell me maybe next time and to prevent a fight would give me a bite or 2 of their dish.  Good chance they were right and I did not like such and ate what was provided.  There was the one time they decided to allow for me to learn the lesson about how it was not always the best.  I was about your daughters age, was in a green phase, and saw the green items.  Dad was eating such, and I wanted one.  I was doing what your daughter was doing, and my parents, knowing I would put up a fuss, decided to allow for me to try part of what my father was eating.

My dad always insisted on reading my younger brother and i the whole menu anywhere we went, because he always believed we should be allowed to make a real choice same as the adults. Anyway, that\u2019s how my brother and I ordered 110$ of lobster lasagna with brandy sauce between the two of us. My parents had warned us it would be disgusting- and it was. Now this wasn\u2019t the make or break on my parents budget at the time, but they had three kids in daycare and my mom worked part time to help care for her mom so it did hurt a bit.

Like if it was jewelry or something delicate like electronics or glass they'd mess up because they're little and don't have motor control or caution, fair enough, but this is *food*.  You're just meant to eat it.

Lobster was historically fed to prisoners, slaves, apprentices...oh, and children. \n\nIf you weren't willing to buy it, you shouldn't have listed it as an option.

I definitely let him try mine first if I thought he might not like it.", "Why give her a choice if you were just going to ignore it?\n\nIts like if you ask her if she can grab something for you and when she says no you demand it because you are the parent, thats a good way to lose respect from your child.", "NTA\n\nHi, daughter here. Well, 26 years ago I was anyway. Mom caved and got me the lobster and I refused to eat it.

It happens, that's childhood, and I think a lot of folks have embarrassing memories related to bad feelings in a restaurant. But we do the best of our capabilities at any time.

Plus, if your brother decided to take that moment to call you an AH, that would have been my cue to get up and walk out and never bother with him again.  The real problem here is you are trying to be a nice, reasonable person when you are being disrespected.  Without realizing it you are signaling that it's okay to insult you and abuse you.  And so, that is how they will treat you. You don't owe anyone an explanation.  You are an adult.   You have the right and in fact the responsibility to make decisions for yourself and your child.  Someone else's opinions, except maybe for your husband's when it comes to your child only, are irrelevant.  That's what I suggest you focus on.  Your child is grumpy and pouty?   SO WHAT?

Since he was 3 the only thing he\u2019ll eat at a local favorite of ours is the noodles and shrimp. So guess what he gets? Noodles and shrimp.", "My son\u2019s grandfather got him his first all-you-can-eat crab legs at 18 months. That kid has had expensive taste since diapers! \nI made most our meals so he never developed a taste for the kid fare like nuggets and fries. I sincerely appreciate the few restaurants that put good options like salmon, steak, shrimp etc. on their kids\u2019 menu.", "That\u2019s how my guy was brought up, too, always everything homemade and eating whatever we ate. I have a mild allergy to shellfish and have to take a Benadryl before eating crab legs every New Years or I get itchy hands, so I held off on letting him try them for awhile and now I think he\u2019d eat them daily if he could \ud83d\ude02 Kid menus are always so bland, I tend to eat small amounts anyway so we usually split a main course. Which would\u2019ve been a perfect solution for OP- simply give her daughter some bites of her meal.", "Just wait until he is 16 and is eating you out of house and home.  It's going to get expensive.", "I'll never forget waitressing in college at a super bougie place in the Hamptons and this one family... ugh they were the worst. \n\n\nOrdered blackened tuna steak for their young child. \n\n\nAnd then sent it back because it was \"burnt black and also raw inside\" and we were like... yes? That's what its supposed to look like.", "That's what really put him into YTA for me. Like that's just nuts...say \"we'll buy something like this to make at home sometime so you can try it, but let's pick out something we know you'll love so we don't bother the chef with having to make you two meals\"", " that made me laugh", "My dad (1929) grew up in poverty. By at least 1967, when I was eight, he had worked hard, could take the 4 of us to nice restaurants. But Dad didn't know how to cook, thought the menu's most expensive item (usually a huge steak) was going to be the best! I grew up reading Mom' cookbooks, and Gourmet Magazine. Understood ingredients! I would order more adventurous but less expensive items, poor Dad would look sadly at my meal, wish he had Ordered That! Snuck him some bites. This happened time after time, didn't understand why Dad didn't wait to see my order, but he could be ferocious, certainly not going to challenge him.  \n\n\nAs a kid, I was skinny and active, could eat a full adult dinner, as portioned back then. (Todays portions (US) are just too enormous.) We didn't have take home, just doggie bags for steak bones. Little bro had kid's menu, graduated by 8-9 years. We had some incredible restaurant meals, through many decades, childhood, adulthood, adulthood when my husband and I were pleased to treat, also. My mom was a good cook, as I am, so tasty meals at home. \n\nThe opportunity to try different foods was a boon, I grew up to order the most unusual item on the menu, or (later) something I couldn't easily prepare at home.\n\nOld creaky (63) lady here, but our childhood restaurant adventures gave us a wider palate, not always possible with allergies, food/medical problems, of course!", "Astonished servers at ten and younger (late 60s) ordering raw oysters as a appetizer.  Oh, the days, when still safe to eat in our area. NC/VA/SC. Miss that. Love my medium rare salmon, your kid rocks!", "Appetizers. A lot of places have good stuff in appetizers for less money and more kid friendly portions. We order my 5yo appetizers all the time and he loves it.  If one isn't enough, we order 2, or a side a la carte.", "I'm totally with you here. I probably would give one bite and that'd be it. I'm definitely not sliding my king crab legs to my 8-year-old and then eating his lasagna. Then again at 5, I was barely bringing my ADHDer son anywhere we had to wear real pants. Had to get him eval'd and medicated, and just since meds has he been the kinda kid I could bring to a restaurant at all.", "Yes I fall here too. If this is an expense thing and op wants to treat herself, leave the kid at home with dad. If this is \u201cI\u2019m treating both of us but don\u2019t think you\u2019ll like this dish and don\u2019t want to waste the money,\u201d let her try your dish. Worst case scenario is she wants more and you need to order more.", "Treating my kids like what? Knowing damn well they won\u2019t eat a $30 lobster?\ud83d\ude02 Wanting to eat my own dinner? Getting my kids things *I know they will actually eat* when we\u2019re at a restaurant that costs triple what it would to make at home? \n\nAgain, at home, idc. They can try anything or not try anything. This specific question was based on a restaurant.", "Yep, what and about Indian, Asian, etc areas. No little jars of Gerbers, Beechnut, roaming around Nepal, or Inuit tribes. Kids needed protein, etc. \n\nBest I understand, parents pre-chewed adult foods, gently pushed into the baby's mouth. Helpful adult enzymes, etc. May sound gross to us, but other \"creatures\" feed their young in a similar manner."]}
