I (27M) went to a restaurant with my brother (22) as well as my daughter (5). We haven' t seen each other in a while so we wanted to talk there and took my daughter with me because she loves her uncle which he does too. Neither did I invite him nor he me so he would pay for him and I for my daughter andmyself.\nI normally don't spend much on food so I wanted to treat myself a little and ordered something with lobster which wasn't all too cheap. My brother ordered something with pasta which was cheaper I suppose if it's important. As my daughter can't really read yet I listed some of the things I knew she'd like from the menu. I decided before I did so and told my brother what it was because he asked me about it. After I listed my daughter the dishes she said that she wanted to have the same I had and I refused right away. When she asked why I told her something along the lines of \"It's too expensive to order it for you too. Plus you wouldn't appreciate it anyway and won't eat up. In ten years or so we can talk about it again. We could get a small lasagna for you. You like lasagna\" My daughter refused to decide for anything else so in the end I just ordered the lasagna for her. My brother called me an AH for saying that my daughter wouldn't appreciate it because of her age. I didn't respond to it and just sighed as I didn't want it to escalate into a fight. The mood was quite tense from that moment on and my daughter wouldn't stop pouting, even refusing to eat her lasagna until I told her that she wouldn't get anything else at home for a couple of hours. \nWhen I got home my husband asked why our daughter was so grumpy so I told him what was up. He doesn't really like my brother which is why he didn't want to come along for anyone wondering. He didn't neccessarily agree nor disagree with my decision per se but thinks I shouldn't have directly told our daughter that because she wouldn't be grumpy and pouty now. \n\nI'd just like to have some opinions from people outside the situation and my close ones. I don't think I'm the AH but my brother does so maybe someone can explain his views to me if you share them?\nSo- AITA?", "created_utc": 1674556982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k2odx/aita_for_refusing_to_order_lobster_for_my_5_year/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I totally get not wanting to order her an adult size portion of lobster. But instead of encouraging your kid to try new things you decided for her that she should be a picky kid. As others mentioned, why not share some and get lasagna as a back up? I do this with my kid all the time (who happens to love lobster). And then bribing a kid to eat just rubs me the wrong way. Food is not a manipulation tactic, it\u2019s to be enjoyed and keep us nourished.", "You're N T A for not ordering it for her right out of the bat, however, YTA for not giving it some of yours to try and telling her she won't appreciate it. \"Sweetheart, is really expensive right now to buy you this dish since you've never tried it before and you may not like it, how about we get you the lasagna, which you do like and I'll share some of my dish for you to try and see if you like it? If you like it then next time we could probably get you some for yourself\" \n\nWhen I was growing up, my mom would NEVER buy me something at a restaurant that I never tried before because in her own words \"I'm not wasting my money on something you won't like\" she would also never share what she got with me because she was sure \"I wouldn't like it\" so I never really learned to eat sooooo many things and was qualified as a \"picky eater\" by everyone because it was easier for my mom to get me chicken nuggets and fries then let me try new things even if just a bite from her plate. \nNow as an adult, I've had to fix my relationship with food and force myself to learn to eat like an adult and not like a child. Luckily for me I have a husband who eats everything and now is much better for me, I've expanded my palate, I've learned to eat/cook more things and after years of this I can finally say - that I was never a picky eater, I was just highly restricted by my parents.\n\nEdit to add: I have my own kid now (he turns 6 today actually) and I let him try from mine and his father's plate whenever we eat something he's never had and he loves shrimp, scallops, most types of fish he's tried and he absolutely loves his veggies. So my advice is not to buy the whole thing right away, just let your kid try it. Teach them to eat good now and you won't end up with a \"picky\" teen/adult.", "YTA entirely for how you handled this.\n\nYeah, buying an expensive lobster meal for a 5 year old is unsustainable. Yeah, it sucks paying for shit your kids claim to want and then don\u2019t even try and eat and it wrecks me watching it go to waste too.\n\nYou could easily have shared some of your meal with your child, and let her have lasagne as a fallback.

It's a great way to introduce kids to new flavours and broad tastes as a kid is always a good thing", "NTA I understand being conservative with your money especially when you have no idea if she'd like it. But, you could have let her try yours. When my eldest was 5 years old she  loved lobster. Now she definitely didn't get it often, but when we would go on cruises I refused the kids menu for her and let her order off the adult menu. I think that this helped her, in part, develop a varied and adventurous palate.", "You have a 5 year old child and sound like someone without children to me. \n\n\nYTA not for not ordering lobster but for how you handled absolutly everything about this. \n\n\nWould you not be insulted if someone would tell you good food would be wasted on you? Why do you expect your child to react any different? \n\n\nThere are multiple easy ways to say no without insulting your child.\n\n\n\"You never had this, rather order something you know you like. \" is such a basic parents response. Even the \"it is spicy\" lie is better as this.\n\n\nJust deciding it will be lasagne and she has to eat it should also be the absolut last resort.

While the explanation may have gone over better if you\u2019d left out the part about your daughter being unable to appreciate it, what it ultimately comes down to is that you weren\u2019t financially comfortable paying for two lobster meals. That\u2019s enough of a reason and beyond that, your brother has no right to second guess your parenting. Also, not everyone likes lobster, so unless you know your child would\u2019ve eaten her dinner, it easily could\u2019ve ended up wasted. I think you could\u2019ve handled it better by promising to let her try a piece if she compromised and accepted the lasagna so she wouldn\u2019t have felt \u201cleft out\u201d but that\u2019s your call as a parent. \n\nFwiw, though, children that age absolutely can appreciate the taste of lobster even if they don\u2019t understand the luxury nature of it.

But if she wants to try it I hope you have her some of yours!", "Nta. With the cost of the lobster I wouldnt share or order one for her.", "NTA. You could have handled it better, for example \"this dish has lobster in it and not everyone likes lobster and you haven't tried it before. Let's get you lasagne because it's definitely delicious and you can try some of mine this time\".

Hopefully by the time the good comes she will forget about it, or worst case she tries a bite and likes it and forgets about it the next time you go to the restaurant because she still can\u2019t read.

Either way no harm done and your daughter would've probably been happy this way.", "My kid loves lobster and caviar, oysters and all that, so I split that with her and then we order a side of something else too.

It would be a waste", "NTA for not ordering her own. She's 5. She'd eat like 5 bites, tops. I understand the sentiment. But you definitely should have let her eat some of yours.

To your daughter, it just sounds like you said she\u2019s some second class citizen because of her age.  YTA and have no tact.", "Not the AH for not ordering her own.

See, the child is a person as well. You treated her like she was less worthy because she\u2019s a kid. You chose to bring her to the restaurant.

Even before we had kids, my husband and I would always order different things and share so we could try more than one dish. When our daughter was a toddler, we'd just share whatever our meal was with her, because even the kids portions were too big and she always insisted on eating whatever we had anyway.

After the initial \"let's try individual foods to make sure you don't have allergy\" phase we just generally feed her what we are having. \n\nPeople have made comments about barely spicy pasta sauce, Curries, soup, peas over rice. Like people seem surprised we offer the baby options with flavor.", "Mine honestly is only picky in the expensive direction. :). Kids menus are the worst. Until recently, I could get away with one or two apps and one entree, sharing everything, but it is not enough now\u2026", "I mean... if you're getting lobster in the midwest that's on you.\n\nI think a lobster plate was about $30-40 when I was on the Maine coast this last summer - and I was in about the most touristy part of Maine; I would imagine it's available cheaper. I'm looking at the kids menu for the lobster shack I had lunch at - the kids menu options are hot dog, mac and cheese, PB&J, ham and cheese sandwich, tuna salad sandwich, or grilled cheese. If I had a kid who ate enough to justify his own meal, I would probably order him a lobster of his own rather than off the kids menu. It's a special occasion, it's not like we're going there every week."]}
