Plus I'm on mobile and English isn't my first language so I'm sorry for eventual formatting and spelling issues \n\nWell anyway. I (27M) went to a restaurant with my brother (22) as well as my daughter (5). We haven' t seen each other in a while so we wanted to talk there and took my daughter with me because she loves her uncle which he does too. Neither did I invite him nor he me so he would pay for him and I for my daughter andmyself.\nI normally don't spend much on food so I wanted to treat myself a little and ordered something with lobster which wasn't all too cheap. My brother ordered something with pasta which was cheaper I suppose if it's important. As my daughter can't really read yet I listed some of the things I knew she'd like from the menu. I decided before I did so and told my brother what it was because he asked me about it. After I listed my daughter the dishes she said that she wanted to have the same I had and I refused right away. When she asked why I told her something along the lines of \"It's too expensive to order it for you too. Plus you wouldn't appreciate it anyway and won't eat up. In ten years or so we can talk about it again. We could get a small lasagna for you. You like lasagna\" My daughter refused to decide for anything else so in the end I just ordered the lasagna for her. My brother called me an AH for saying that my daughter wouldn't appreciate it because of her age. I didn't respond to it and just sighed as I didn't want it to escalate into a fight. The mood was quite tense from that moment on and my daughter wouldn't stop pouting, even refusing to eat her lasagna until I told her that she wouldn't get anything else at home for a couple of hours. \nWhen I got home my husband asked why our daughter was so grumpy so I told him what was up. He doesn't really like my brother which is why he didn't want to come along for anyone wondering. He didn't neccessarily agree nor disagree with my decision per se but thinks I shouldn't have directly told our daughter that because she wouldn't be grumpy and pouty now. \n\nI'd just like to have some opinions from people outside the situation and my close ones. I don't think I'm the AH but my brother does so maybe someone can explain his views to me if you share them?\nSo- AITA?", "created_utc": 1674556982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k2odx/aita_for_refusing_to_order_lobster_for_my_5_year/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019ve taken my nephew (he was 5ish at the time) to the hardware store with me and told him he could pick out something for himself while there (they have die casts of farm equipment and construction equipment).

Based on some of the comments here; I was a bad person for not buying him his own chainsaw or letting him play with the one I was purchasing for myself.

You brother needs to learn to mind his own business.
