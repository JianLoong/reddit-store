What you are about to read, is a recent cause of emotional distress for me, regret, and I'm doing this post with the help of my colleague and his son, whom insist I'm doing the right thing.\n\nI'm 63 years old. I took advantage of better times, financially speaking, and managed to get enough money to save, have a good retirement, and leave a good inheritance for my children. However, their actions in recent years has broken my heart.\n\nMy oldest daughter is a lawyer, married to an attorney. I have another son who is also a lawyer, a third who became an engineer, and the youngest, who is a salesman. \n\nI have been a smoker for many years, and, the predictable outcome has finally caught me, so I may not have many years left. After knowing this, my children began stabbing each other's backs, trying to get their inheritance earlier. Initially were frequent verbal discussions, that escalated to legal battles. The boiling point came when my daughter forged her brothers' signature to take their part of the inheritance while I was being treated at the hospital. Now, none of the siblings can see each other in the eye, and only talk through lawyers.\n\nSaddened by this situation, decided to spend the money, thinking that if all of it is gone, they would have no more reasons to fight. I donated to charities, bought my wife beauty items, went on vacations with her paying for the better looking hotel rooms (no planes because of covid travel restrictions), gave my grandkids expensive gifts, bought my dearests friends and colleagues better equipments to improve their work. We bought a huge TV, prepaid for my funeral, tasted some fine whiskey, among other things.\n\nRight now, about 65-70 percent of my saving are now gone. I plan to keep enough for the time I have left, and leave my wife a good cash amount.\n\nHowever, my children are noticing that I'm spending a lot, and started to ask questions. My daughter figured out what happened on her own. I had no rebuttals, since I'm guilty of all the accusations she made, but then she mentioned that her children will suffer because of my selfish acts, not only that, but I am cursing all of her grandchildren by doing this.\n\nThat made me think, that my grandchildren shouldn't be punished for their parents' sins, and maybe, I was too self-absorbed to realize it sooner. That's my dilemma now.", "created_utc": 1670947681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkzaf8/aita_for_spending_my_childrens_inheritance/", "score": 635, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you are about to read, is a recent cause of emotional distress for me, regret, and I'm doing this post with the help of my colleague and his son, whom insist I'm doing the right thing.\n\nI'm 63 years old.

I would leave nothing to these greedy people.", "You are absolutely **NTA.**\n\nAnd for the record, the fact that you're even worried about this says so much about what a lovely, caring person you are, which makes you doubly NTA. And which also makes it so much more heartbreaking that your children have let you down like this. And I want to be really clear: *this is in fact the situation here, that YOUR CHILDREN HAVE LET YOU DOWN, and not the other way around.* \n\nAny good estate lawyer or therapist will agree, and I think it's important that you not only read this, but repeat it to yourself as many times as you need in order to really internalise it:\n\nYOUR CHILDREN NEVER HAD AN INHERITANCE. \n\nThat may seem like an odd thing to say, when you had saved money to leave to them before all this happened, but it is nonetheless the truth. Your children never had an inheritance because UNTIL YOU DIE, ANY \"INHERITANCE\" IS THEORETICAL. And I think that far too many greedy, self-absorbed offspring tend to forget this far too easily, that UNTIL YOU ARE GONE, THAT MONEY IS NOT \"THEIR INHERITANCE\", it is simply your money, that you earned, no matter what plans may have been put in place for later. And as long as you are alive, the money that you worked hard for is, morally, ethically, and in every other way, yours to use as you see fit. Your adult children - particularly given that they are healthy, able, and in good financial situations - are not due anything out of your bank account or otherwise. For the record, neither are your grandkids. It is not cruel not to leave your own money to other people, but to choose to enjoy it yourself. You're the one who earned it. There should never be any expectation that anyone but you (and your life partner) would be the one to spend it.\n\nThe only \"inheritance\" that exists is whatever is left over when you are gone and finished using it yourself, hopefully to make your life easier and more pleasant, since you're the one who worked so hard for it.\n\nAnd I can tell you, you are far from the first parent to look at your adult kids squabbling hatefully over money that isn't even theirs, before you are even gone, and felt deeply disappointed and hurt by the sort of people your kids have become. And truly, I'm sorry for that. It's an awful thing for a parent to realise that their kids have become unkind, selfish human beings. But your response is 100% appropriate. Tell them there will be no inheritance; tell them that you're disappointed in their behaviour and their greed, and that you have chosen to use the money you earned to enjoy the last days of your life and ease your way, as you deserve.

It shouldn\u2019t be an expectation imo. \n\n(This also obviously comes from a huge place of privilege.

We measure housing bids in $100k increments. You could have tacked $10k onto mine and it literally wouldn't have made a difference.\n\nThe real interesting part is that prices only increase on transitory things. A lot of stuff has a standard retail price regardless of where ever you are. A $400 Playstation 5 is a lot of money when your rent is $400, but is not if you're used to paying $3000 in rent. I just bought a brand new car and it was cheaper than a year of my mortgage, so while it was expensive, it wasn't THAT expensive. True HCOL areas truly have a completely economic balance."]}
