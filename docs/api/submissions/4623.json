What you are about to read, is a recent cause of emotional distress for me, regret, and I'm doing this post with the help of my colleague and his son, whom insist I'm doing the right thing.\n\nI'm 63 years old. I took advantage of better times, financially speaking, and managed to get enough money to save, have a good retirement, and leave a good inheritance for my children. However, their actions in recent years has broken my heart.\n\nMy oldest daughter is a lawyer, married to an attorney. I have another son who is also a lawyer, a third who became an engineer, and the youngest, who is a salesman.\n\nI have been a smoker for many years, and, the predictable outcome has finally caught me, so I may not have many years left. After knowing this, my children began stabbing each other's backs, trying to get their inheritance earlier. Initially were frequent verbal discussions, that escalated to legal battles. The boiling point came when my daughter forged her brothers' signature to take their part of the inheritance while I was being treated at the hospital. Now, none of the siblings can see each other in the eye, and only talk through lawyers.\n\nSaddened by this situation, decided to spend the money, thinking that if all of it is gone, they would have no more reasons to fight. I donated to charities, bought my wife beauty items, went on vacations with her paying for the better looking hotel rooms (no planes because of covid travel restrictions), gave my grandkids expensive gifts, bought my dearests friends and colleagues better equipments to improve their work. We bought a huge TV, prepaid for my funeral, tasted some fine whiskey, among other things.\n\nRight now, about 65-70 percent of my saving are now gone. I plan to keep enough for the time I have left, and leave my wife a good cash amount.\n\nHowever, my children are noticing that I'm spending a lot, and started to ask questions. My daughter figured out what happened on her own. I had no rebuttals, since I'm guilty of all the accusations she made, but then she mentioned that her children will suffer because of my selfish acts, not only that, but I am cursing all of her grandchildren by doing this.\n\nThat made me think, that my grandchildren shouldn't be punished for their parents' sins, and maybe, I was too self-absorbed to realize it sooner. That's my dilemma now.\n\nEdit: Hi, I'm OP's friend's son. I'm writing here because I want to clarify something.\n\nWhere we are from, whatever savings the person has, goes directly into their children and living spouse, this is how the law is written. You can write a will on top of that, but biological or legally adopted children can not be entirely written out. Unless (from my understanding) one of the beneficiaries writes themself out of the inheritance. What OP's daughter did was forging a signature in some papers saying the rest of the brothers renounced their inheritance, and they are suing, at the same time as they try to lock in some of OP's properties for themselves while he is still alive, basically trying to do that before another sibling does it before them. \n\nMy relationship with OP is that my dad and him are lifelong friends and colleagues, so OP is kinda like my uncle, as well as my private linguistics teacher. OP has been reading a lot of your comments, and will wake up tomorrow to read even more comments. I suggested OP to post here, and helped to set up the account, and he wrote the post by himself.

What you are about to read, is a recent cause of emotional distress for me, regret, and I'm doing this post with the help of my colleague and his son, whom insist I'm doing the right thing.\n\nI'm 63 years old.

And which also makes it so much more heartbreaking that your children have let you down like this. And I want to be really clear: *this is in fact the situation here, that YOUR CHILDREN HAVE LET YOU DOWN, and not the other way around.* \n\nAny good estate lawyer or therapist will agree, and I think it's important that you not only read this, but repeat it to yourself as many times as you need in order to really internalise it:\n\nYOUR CHILDREN NEVER HAD AN INHERITANCE. \n\nThat may seem like an odd thing to say, when you had saved money to leave to them before all this happened, but it is nonetheless the truth. Your children never had an inheritance because UNTIL YOU DIE, ANY \"INHERITANCE\" IS THEORETICAL. And I think that far too many greedy, self-absorbed offspring tend to forget this far too easily, that UNTIL YOU ARE GONE, THAT MONEY IS NOT \"THEIR INHERITANCE\", it is simply your money, that you earned, no matter what plans may have been put in place for later. And as long as you are alive, the money that you worked hard for is, morally, ethically, and in every other way, yours to use as you see fit. Your adult children - particularly given that they are healthy, able, and in good financial situations - are not due anything out of your bank account or otherwise. For the record, neither are your grandkids. It is not cruel not to leave your own money to other people, but to choose to enjoy it yourself. You're the one who earned it. There should never be any expectation that anyone but you (and your life partner) would be the one to spend it.\n\nThe only \"inheritance\" that exists is whatever is left over when you are gone and finished using it yourself, hopefully to make your life easier and more pleasant, since you're the one who worked so hard for it.\n\nAnd I can tell you, you are far from the first parent to look at your adult kids squabbling hatefully over money that isn't even theirs, before you are even gone, and felt deeply disappointed and hurt by the sort of people your kids have become. And truly, I'm sorry for that. It's an awful thing for a parent to realise that their kids have become unkind, selfish human beings. But your response is 100% appropriate. Tell them there will be no inheritance; tell them that you're disappointed in their behaviour and their greed, and that you have chosen to use the money you earned to enjoy the last days of your life and ease your way, as you deserve.

I've always considered it important to have familial wealth, and that it should be added to and passed forward. If you received help, then imho, you need to pass it forward. To use all the wealth up yourself is beyond greedy. Maybe I was raised differently, but that money is not mine to keep. It's to help, and I'm a custodian until it is passed on. I am thankful for what that inheritance allowed me to achieve, but without the opportunity, would I have had the same success? Likely no. My hard work would have made me successful, but not to the same level. \n\n2) You need to communicate with your children. If you didn't put in the safeguards or taught them poorly, then that is on you. Now you are letting them fight it out and bicker. I haven't seen any mention that you talked to them about your displeasure at any point.

You were not being selfish. \n\nIs there a way where you live that you can set up a small trust fund for each grandchild that the parents can\u2019t access and the grandchild gets when they are 18? Perhaps that might soothe your worry. But you are certainly NTA for spending your money as you see fit AND with the goal of removing it as a poison from your children\u2019s relationship.

The fact your children are fighting over your money, like vultures, while you\u2019re still living, is completely crass and disgusting. Especially so as they all have well paying jobs.

A few of my cousins started fighting over what they should and shouldn\u2019t get, I told my cousins what I\u2019m telling you. There\u2019s no inheritance until someone dies. My grandfather, however, when my cousins came complaining did one better. He told those cousins he is not responsible for them. Their father, his son, is responsible for them. He had 3 living children, and his estate, after his death, would be divided between his 3 children. It\u2019s up to our parents to do the same for all of us. It\u2019s the same for you OP. Your kids, are responsible for their own children. \n\nYour daughter has no business complaining either. She thought it was okay to try and get more than her fair share, and if you were able, I\u2019d honestly cut her out altogether. Not for favouritism, but simply because she tried to steal from her siblings. Actions have consequences though, and since they\u2019ve been fighting over your money before you\u2019ve passed away, it\u2019s karma that they won\u2019t get much. If they aren\u2019t behaving so atrociously over your money, they would\u2019ve gotten a nice lump sum after your passing. Instead, that\u2019s going to be greatly reduced, and it\u2019s entirely on them. I mean if you REALLY want to, you could leave your grandchildren something.

Plus they all have good jobs and arent probably hurting financially.\n\nIf you do want to leave something to grandkids cant you set up educational funds or trusts that your kids cant touch?", "This sounds like France which has really stupid inheritance laws. I would spend it all and sell the property if the law allows. \n\nPigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered. Your children are like greedy hogs. Splitting your funds before you are even dead.  Ugh!", "Hey OP, you are NTA. What your children have done is not only disgusting, but it's against the law. You never put anyone else's name on anything unless it's a gift lol.\n\nHonestly I think you took a bad thing and made it wonderful. You're creating more memorable time with those you care about and putting money into charities. I mean you seriously turned everything around in the most beautiful way.

I\u2019m not interested, it\u2019s a shitty way die, but if it floats your boat, you do you. There\u2019s way too many worse things in the world and if the OP got some peace and enjoyment from smoking, then c\u2019est la vie. He and his wife should paint the town red and enjoy every last second and spend +their+ money on the people and experiences they want! Hell, the two of them should go to DisneyWorld without any of their family just for the fun of doing it.", "The only point to make here is do NOT cut the kids out completely.
