We have one older sister who I will call Natalie (29F) who got married in 2019 and then had her first baby in 2021. My family is super traditional and so Natalie wanted to be the first to get married and have a baby. She waited two years before finally getting pregnant because of the pandemic and her moving away with her husband. Because of this, my second oldest sister, who I will call Kimberly, waited to get married and get pregnant until after Natalie announced her pregnancy.  She had been trying for a child for a few months before I announced the date of my and my fianc\u00e9s wedding which would be held in September of 2023. I announced this in the fall of 2022 and I asked her to stop trying for a baby so that she would be able to come to the wedding as it will be a destination wedding and you can\u2019t fly when you\u2019re pregnant. She told me she would take it into consideration but because she had been trying for close to 7 months and she and our oldest sister wanted to have their kids be close in age surprise surprise, she got pregnant soon after. The real kicker? Her due date is the EXACT SAME DAY as my wedding. I\u2019m furious and so is my fianc\u00e9. When we found out it would be the same date, I insisted my mom come to my wedding and not the birth because I announced the wedding date BEFORE Kimberly got pregnant. I have been the primary planner of my wedding and I\u2019m so excited to get married to my fianc\u00e9 of 5 years. My whole family knows how much effort I have been putting into the planning since I proposed. Because of this, my mom informed Kimberly she will be coming to my wedding and not the birth. My entire family is split down the middle as to whether my mom should be at attendance at my wedding or the birth of Kimberly\u2019s first child. For context, my dad is a bit of a shithead and useless in a crisis so mom is definitely the favored parent and the wedding is happening across the country from where Kimberly plans to give birth. This has torn my family apart. So, am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR; my sister got pregnant and her due date is the same day as my wedding which I announced before she got pregnant.

It's scary AF. \n\nOP is definitely TA.", "I'm surprised no one has mentioned that before. Fertility can be really tricky and unpredictable. Getting pregnant is never a sure thing, no matter how much you try to plan it. Op sounds like the sister deliberately got pregnant so that her due date is the wedding. \nIt's just a big, sad coincidence!\nOp was wrong to ask her to adjust her family planning for the wedding. And Op is wrong for asking their Mum to come to the wedding instead of the birth, and especially insist she comes.", "If it's a destination wedding (it's atleast across the country fr the sis), they likely had to book in advance. And the next open slot could be 6 months later, maybe even longer if they plan the wedding to be, say, 3 months after the birth or 3onths before. They set a date at a location and likely chose the specific month on purpose for weather reasons, aski g someone to not have unprotected sex for a month or two so they aren't about to pop and can come celebrate with you? Is that really so heinous.", "Yes. Either he's into those traditions and wait for his sister to give birth before he has his wedding or he's breaking the tradition and does what ever he wants, but he can't be mad at his family for honoring that (weird) tradition and he can't force them to break it either.\n\nAlso note, how weird is it for the grandma to be there at the birth of the child. I get it to be there afterwards to help out and stuff, but I'd never want anyone to be there while it happens. So It baffles me why the mother can't just come to the wedding and maybe just leave a day or two early to be there for sister the days after the birth. With that said, ESH for fighting for their mothers attention and I would have made the same choice as the mother as well, unless it turns out to be a high risk birth or something. But as for now it's safe to assume the sister will be fine without her mother. There's enough medical staff, her husband will be there and she probably won't be out of the hospital for few days regardless.", "I would die to know whether she also asked her grandparents, please, not to die or develop any disease which could overshadow her gReaT DaY", "As someone 38 weeks pregnant I really hope that women don\u2019t die that often while giving birth in 2023\ud83e\udd28", "Exactly, in a normal family, everybody would be a bit sad those two things coincide, but happy for two very happy events. And then discuss what the best course of action is - try to reschedule the wedding? Deal with sister missing it? Ask mum where she'd rather be if worst comes to worst, but hope she can be there for both children? See if sister can find a different support plan for the birth? There's plenty you can actually do if you care about the people in your family more than some unnecessary, bizarre rules that just make life more complicated and don't mean anything outside your numerically ordered marriage and birthing cult you call a family.", "All good.  No paragraphs made it hard to read.", "Yeah he was wrong to ask her point blank to not get pregnant. But honestly she\u2019s no better by insisting on getting pregnant knowing she was risking giving birth when the whole family is expecting to be in another country, and then expecting their mom to skip his wedding to be there for her. I honestly think they both suck.", "It isn't 2 months though is it? He wants her to stop trying until after the wedding as she can't fly while pregnant. Since the wedding is September that's 5 months from now. Since he announced it last fall that's a long time for her to stop trying."]}
