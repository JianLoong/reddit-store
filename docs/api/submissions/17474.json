Never mind!", "Yeah f that, just don't make it an option. Let them know that you and your partner will not be bunking with anyone else and you're not comfortable sharing the room with **their** kid. You're all paying equally so their kid who's not paying stays with them. \n\nYou paid for your own room, you should get your own room period. Or else he can sleep on the couch if the parents object.

Not that it changes anything, just to understand their motivation.\n\nI think you can say up front that while historically you've been asked to room with nephew, at this stage in you life/relationship, you're not comfortable with it. Are you or you partner expected to do all dressing/changing in the bathroom? It's really odd that he WOULDN'T be staying with his parents.\n\nWould it be easier to talk to aunt/uncle rather than your parents? Would they take it better if it came from your partner?", "Why did you agree to stay with your family in the first place if this could be an option?", "Not a premarital thing.

That's fine, but you've shot down every idea. \n\nYou have to draw a boundary.
