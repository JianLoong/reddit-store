Her generous nature has been taken advantage of in the past. She has a husband Liam (30M) and a daughter Lia (7F). My daughter works full time and does most of the housework.\n\nAlmost a year ago, Eve\u2019s college friend Sonja started to live with them when she divorced her husband. Eve confided in her mother and me that it seemed Sonja was taking her place in the family. Both my granddaughter and son in law would gang up on Eve. I heard Lia say that she wished Sonja was her mom after Eve didn\u2019t give her more candy and she would say that Sonja was prettier because of her blonde hair. Liam and Lia would say \u201cAuntie Sonja\u2019s the best. Auntie Sonja\u2019s the favorite.\u201d Liam would always praise Sonja. Eve spoke about her concerns but she was reluctant to kick Sonja out because she had nowhere to go and her family liked Sonja. \n\nA few weeks ago, Eve got into a terrible car accident when a drunk driver hit her head on. At the hospital, when she stabilized, we were allowed to come and see her. Sonja came with Lia as Liam was on a business trip. My daughter was very injured. Lia didn\u2019t want to approach the hospital bed. Sonja said Eve looked like a mummy. Lia hates anything Halloween. Lia screamed and said Mommy looks ugly and scary. She clung to Sonja\u2019s leg. My daughter was awake to hear that. \n\nWe thought she was getting better but her health got worse after that and she had to go in emergency room again. Eve is in the ICU now with her mother as a guest. I asked the nurses to only let people in who Eve asked to be in.\n\nLiam finally could fly back and came to the hospital with Sonja and Lia. He begged me and the nurses to let them all inside but they refused as Eve hasn\u2019t asked for anyone but her mother. He yelled at me that his daughter wanted her mother. I took him aside and said Eve was in very bad shape. He said he didn\u2019t care that she looked bad. I said Lia didn\u2019t want to see her mother and that Sonja could comfort him now. He stormed off but hasn\u2019t left the hospital since either. AITA?\n\nEdit: Eve has been told Liam is there. Eve hasn\u2019t asked for anyone but her mother/my wife when awake. She\u2019s in a lot of pain.", "created_utc": 1675024497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10oht8j/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughters_husband_and_our/", "score": 1218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I respect that you're trying to leave Eve in charge of who she sees, and you're not an asshole for doing that.

Friend made an insensitive remark that caused the daughter to have an adverse reaction which possibly resulted in mother's health declining.  Because of this you made the decision to have the hospital staff exclude any visitors that the mother didn't explicitly ask for.  At this point we don't know the full mental state of the mother and whether she has the full capacity to make a decision on who she wants to see or not.\n\nBecause of your rash reaction you have prevented the child and husband from seeing her and if she continues to decline may never see her again.  You could be causing a lot of harm to two individuals because of a situation you don't fully understand or know the whole story of.

I know this must be a very stressful situation for all of you and you are acting in your daughter's best interest, but please also keep the mental health of you granddaughter in mind. Not being able to see/talk to her mother especially while she must be very worried for her can be a traumatizing experience. Especially if your daughter's health further worsens and you have no guarantess that Lia will even get to talk to her again. \n\nIf you let Lia see her, make sure she gets to see mom with a professional by her side rather than an immature and unqualified adult like Sonja, and maybe ask for someone from the ICU staff to talk to her and prepare her for seeing mommy.\n\nI wish you all the best.", "Unfortunately Liam is next off kin so he has to make health decisions and you're getting involved in a husband: wife relationship that you shouldn't be.   What you should be doing is talking to your daughter and encouraging her to have her husband come in to see her so they can talk.   Sorry but YTA.

I have woken up in hospitals before (icu once) and the only word I said was my husband\u2019s name. Same with surgeries. I had five last summer and every time I was coming out of anesthesia I apparently would only ask for him. A few times when my husband had to work, my mom was there with me (we\u2019re super close in case that matters), and she says that I would always wake up asking for him.

Her generous nature has been taken advantage of in the past. She has a husband Liam (30M) and a daughter Lia (7F). My daughter works full time and does most of the housework.\n\nAlmost a year ago, Eve\u2019s college friend Sonja started to live with them when she divorced her husband. Eve confided in her mother and me that it seemed Sonja was taking her place in the family. Both my granddaughter and son in law would gang up on Eve. I heard Lia say that she wished Sonja was her mom after Eve didn\u2019t give her more candy and she would say that Sonja was prettier because of her blonde hair. Liam and Lia would say \u201cAuntie Sonja\u2019s the best. Auntie Sonja\u2019s the favorite.\u201d Liam would always praise Sonja. Eve spoke about her concerns but she was reluctant to kick Sonja out because she had nowhere to go and her family liked Sonja. \n\nA few weeks ago, Eve got into a terrible car accident when a drunk driver hit her head on. At the hospital, when she stabilized, we were allowed to come and see her. Sonja came with Lia as Liam was on a business trip. My daughter was very injured. Lia didn\u2019t want to approach the hospital bed. Sonja said Eve looked like a mummy. Lia hates anything Halloween. Lia screamed and said Mommy looks ugly and scary. She clung to Sonja\u2019s leg. My daughter was awake to hear that. \n\nWe thought she was getting better but her health got worse after that and she had to go in emergency room again. Eve is in the ICU now with her mother as a guest. I asked the nurses to only let people in who Eve asked to be in.\n\nLiam finally could fly back and came to the hospital with Sonja and Lia. He begged me and the nurses to let them all inside but they refused as Eve hasn\u2019t asked for anyone but her mother. He yelled at me that his daughter wanted her mother. I took him aside and said Eve was in very bad shape. He said he didn\u2019t care that she looked bad. I said Lia didn\u2019t want to see her mother and that Sonja could comfort him now. He stormed off but hasn\u2019t left the hospital since either. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Explain how bad this looks and how having her daughter express fear over her mother\u2019s condition devastated her so much her health got worse. Stress, pain and grief can easily cause both bodily and mental anguish. In her condition it could literally kill her.\n\nBecause Liam refuses to leave the hospital it\u2019s very likely he\u2019s not having an affair. He would have run into Sonja\u2019s arms the first chance he got if that were the case. Take a beat, approach him with love and respect and see how it goes from there. Putting Liam on the immediate defensive won\u2019t solve anything. Give him a chance to see what Sonja is doing to his wife and daughter. His response to that will inform the next steps.\n\nETA: NTA. The only AH so far is Sonja and she needs to be swiftly dealt with.

I simply requested it and they stated they wouldn\u2019t let anyone in that Eve didn\u2019t ask for. \n\nThere\u2019s just one overnight guest allowed in the hospital. Eve wanted her mother. There\u2019s a 10 minute window for visitors. Eve just wanted her mother. There\u2019s a moment where my wife needs to go the bathroom. Eve wanted her mother.

She knows her husband is there and has not asked for him. Is asking her expressly - do you want X in the room - really the best thing to reduce her stress?", "NTA \n\nAnd edit that OP hasn\u2019t even seen her in person since the request! OP asked and was willing to abide by the request himself - that leans toward him not being an asshole toward the husband - he\u2019s not able to see her either.", "Not asked for isn't the same as saying \"tell them don't come\". Has this dude asked her point blank if she understands her husband and child are present in the next room to visit her? Or did they just mak a matter of fact statement and nothing else, letting her post unconsciousness brain \"figure it out.\"\n\nIt sounds like she's been unconscious for a period of time.... The longer it lasts, the longer the fog afterwards lasts. She might be sitting there quietly racking her brain to figure out why they're not coming in.\n\nUnless this guy definitively states that he's made it abundantly clear they're present and want to see her desperately, I'll stick with my opinion that he's the AH on this one.", "It says in OP\u2019s post he asked the nurses to only let people in who Eve asks for.

Unless they have explicitly explained to her \"You can only have one visitor at a time and since you've only actively asked for your Mom, she's the only one in the room but there are others outside for you too\" I have a hard time trusting the OP based on his lawyerly answers.\n\nIt took dozens of people replying for him to answer directly whether he'd directly pointed out that her husband and child were present, and he STILL won't directly answer yes or no as to whether she actually understands what the nuance of the situation is, and that her \"only asking for Mom\" means they're actively keeping them away, rather than them being not present because they don't care.\n\nAnd all of this is before we get to the fact that his claims to have made this clear are contradicted by his statement he hasn't seen her yet, himself.", "I understand that she wants her mother, what I\u2019m saying is you shouldn\u2019t be setting the precedent for her wishes on her behalf. Ultimately her husband is next of kin and he should be advocating for her, not you. He should be allowed in and if she doesn\u2019t want him there then it will be obvious. How do you know she isn\u2019t distressed when her mom leaves just because she\u2019s alone and scared? \n\nAlso, there\u2019s no difference between ordering them not to let him in and requesting that they don\u2019t let him in", "But on that note you literally handled it in the worst way possible.  Did you even try to have a 1:1 discussion about what Sonja did? \n\nEveryone should be coming together for your daughter\u2019s health.  But you\u2019re also taking advantage to get jabs in at your son in law whom you are rightfully pissed at. \n\nYour intent is there but you need to have a serious 1:1 with him.

She is able to speak.", "Exactly. As long as the doctors and nurses seem her capable of making her own decisions, she can choose and she's chosen her mother. OP isn't keeping him out.", "You do realize there is like 0 chance the nurses are baring a patient\u2019s husband without confirmation from the patient herself. The only thing OP\u2019s conversation did was let them know that there is tension in some of relationships in the patients life so they should verify with the patient and not assume who should be let in. Next of kin or not, as long as she is deemed competent to make decisions on who to let in, they will follow her directive. You don\u2019t test an ICU patient\u2019s resolve by springing someone they don\u2019t want to see on them.", "Yeah, imagine she takes a turn for the worse and doesn\u2019t make it.  Lia will hate her grandparents forever in that scenario", "My wife and I had spoken over the phone to him about what Sonja did and he dismissed it as a joke to lighten the mood that didn\u2019t land.", "In OP comments and edit to main post. Only one person is allowed - and she has repeatedly asked for her mom.", "Hi! Veteran of many family members' long term hospitalizations here: The \"one at a time\"rule is one in the room at a time, and not one per admission to the hospital. Just because you only ask for one person doesn't mean you wouldn't welcome others, it means that's who you want to see the most.\n\nThe way that is usually handled is by taking turns.", "He must have said that after responding to my comment, but it is strange that that\u2019s exactly what I asked and he didn\u2019t just say then that the nurses asked her and she said she didn\u2019t want to see her husband. Seems like a big piece of information that would make a lot of difference in wether he\u2019s the AH or not.", "The title is \u201cAITA for not letting\u2026\u201d implying that OP is the one advocating that the husband can\u2019t come in. \n\nI haven\u2019t seen where he specified that the nurses have judged on their own accord that it\u2019s better for just her mom to be in there and that\u2019s the reason for not allowing any other visitors. Nor have I seen that his daughter is coherent enough to make these decisions which is where I say that he\u2019s making assumptions", "Yep I had a relative in the ICU for a while a few years ago after a car wreck. There's a lot of complicated family estrangements in that family. Her nurses pulled me aside to ask about it while she was unconscious (it's hard not to notice the estrangements even if nobody says anything in this particular situation, though everyone had been avoiding talking about it) and I tried to outline the situation as neutrally as possible. I didn't throw anyone under the bus, but I did acknowledge there was a lot of bad blood and estrangement there and I couldn't in all honesty guarantee that one person's behavior and/or presence wasn't going to turn into an issue. \n\nThey thanked me for my candor, told me they'd already received that impression from dealing with other family members, and reassured me that nobody the patient didn't want in the room or making decisions for her was going to be doing that, regardless of their relationship to her. The nursing staff is going to be protective of their patient and loyal to her, not whatever random next of kin is present and demanding access.", "Then the nurses should handle the husband and OP is an AH for taking it into his own hands in the hospital waiting room in front of a 7 year old who wants to see her mom", "right, OP said that the daughter was scared the first time she saw her mother because of a comment sonja made. And that the mother was awake for that. OP didn\u2019t specify that the mother ever said she doesn\u2019t want to see the daughter. Just that he\u2019s enforcing it because he knows how everyone feels (even better than the dad who literally brought her to the hospital saying the daughter wanted to see her mom)", "Does son in law know about the jelousy or hurt he was causing your daughter? or know that in all likelihood him treating the other girl better than he treated his wife is why he's not with her now? Who wants to see someone who treated you like the side-piece in your own home next to you when you are vulnerable and in pain, especially when that person he was treating so well made fun of you and scared your daughter while you were in that vulnerable state? What an absolute monster she is for that, and him dismissing it is fine and dandy but he can't be mad that his wife doesn't want him there.", "You do realize Liam and Sonja are actively having an affair, right? Sonja is hellbent on destroying her friend's life and stealing her place. Why haven't you confronted Liam and Sonja about this?", "While I don't want to add stress I do think the question of why your wife is being pished out of her place as wife and mother by a \"friend\" needs to be adressed. I fear qn affair isn't unrealistic.", "He dismissed?\n\nHE DISMISSED?\n\nSeems like he is protecting his wh0re", "Or you perceived it that way.  \n\nHis wife is in the hospital for weeks.  Surely he misses his wife.  Surely his daughter misses her mom. \n\nEveryone processes grief differently. You don\u2019t get to gate  keep something that your daughter refused to address herself.", "Sadly, I am too. I was actually surprised they're allowing guests into the ICU at all. As for rotation, again - when the patient is in ICU and health professionals see that family dynamics are fraught, they need to reduce risk of escalation. They will not do anything to prejudice recovery. \n\nThe daughter made her wishes known. The husband raised a fuss. Who's the AH?", "The nurses aren't judging on their own accord, though. They are going off the wishes of the patient, and she only wishes to see her mother right now. If she asked for her husband, they'd let him in.", "The nurses already told him no. It\u2019s in the post that the husband is begging both OP and the nurses and the nurses won\u2019t let him in.", "It probably wasn\u2019t just the comment.  \n\nHospitals are scary at that age.  Seeing their mom injured from a head on accident would be scary. \n\nSonja didn\u2019t help the situation.  But it was scary nonetheless. \n\nAnd despite the comment, no one in OP\u2019s family took the child from Sonja and told Sonja to leave.", "He\u2019s fucking Sonja. I don\u2019t understand how OP is missing this glaring red flag, his daughter is being cheated on. He doesn\u2019t want to get rid of Sonja.", "When my brother died waiting for a lung, I can tell you I'd have done literally anything to get past you or anyone else who tried keeping me away, attorneys, court orders, whatever.\n\nAlso, visitors don't just come to help you recover. Sometimes they're there in case you don't recover. Don't forget, her child is excluded, too.\n\nIf her mother doesn't survive, as it stands Eve won't get to say goodbye to her child, and her daughter will live forever with the guilt of their last meeting. Maybe she doesn't give a damn about the marriage anymore, but I doubt she's giving up on her child.\n\nThat's what has the hair on the back of my neck up here."]}
