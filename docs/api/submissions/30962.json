She gave birth to me and then she gave me away to so many different family members and friends of hers over the years that I cannot say she raised me. The longest I was ever under her roof was 2 nights and that was because she was paid to take me for that period of time. She had issues with my bio father, who died before I was born, and she always liked to bring up how I was his kid, etc. Anything to make me less hers and more someone else's problem.\n\nOne time she sent me to live with a friend of hers who was an addict and never checked on me. The only person I was with who loved and cared about me was my grandma. But she died when I was barely 6. She had me for 3 years. It was her who had to pay my mother to take me in for the two days she did. An aunt told me about that some time after that.\n\nMy mother met some guy about 18 months ago and they got married recently and she's now expecting a baby with him. From the outside he appears to be a top notch guy. He was interested in getting to know me, said he would want me to be part of their family. But he knows she didn't raise me or treat me well. He knows she didn't even put me on their wedding guest list herself. He has also witnessed her tell me I'm my father's daughter in the most venom filled way possible. Then he heard her say she was going to be a mom for the first time. So I'm not sure if he's actually good underneath or maybe he cares about appearances.\n\nI did not go to their wedding btw.\n\nNow that she's pregnant I am expected to play pretend and act like we're some kind of family. The only reason I know any of this is she showed up at my job and tried to talk to me. She said I need to at least look supportive of their family but I should really show my face around them more now that she's married and having a kid.\n\nI told her I was not going to cheer on her do-over family and she needed to accept that people might judge her but I didn't fucking care. She called me spiteful and a bitch.\n\nThen the one relative I do actually stay in touch with told me I shouldn't be so sour about the baby and calling them a do-over family because they are innocent.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699970753, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v2xlg/aita_for_telling_my_mother_i_am_not_going_to/", "score": 715, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not obligated to suddenly play happy families because your incubator wants to line up a free babysitter or whatever she's trying to do. Don't punish the baby because your family member is right, the baby didn't ask to be born to this woman any more than you did, but 'not punishing' can simply be not saying bad things about the baby - it doesn't mean you need to engage. \n\nYou may want to consider whether you're willing to be available to the child to provide the love and care your grandmother gave you if your mother reverts to being the kind of \"parent\" she was to you.
