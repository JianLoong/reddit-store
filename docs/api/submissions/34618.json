If she can't set her feelings and wants aside and let you grieve the way that you need to, then she is a selfish, bad partner.", "NTA, sometimes people need time alone, and she should respect that. And yes, that includes time alone from people they love and care about. Loving someone **doesn't** mean you want to be with them *every single moment*.", "NTA, you have to deal in your own way. I\u2019d want the same. Just explain that you\u2019ve been through a terrible time and just want to be by yourself because you are grieving. You appreciate her wanting to keep you company but it\u2019s what you need.", "your partner is being incredible selfish right now. you focus on what you need rn NTA", "NAH. You expressed what you need and so did you gf. She doesn't want to house-sit alone. You would like to be alone. Sadly, these are mutually exclusive. You're going to have to talk this through and either compromise or someone is going to end up disappointed. Sorry.", "NTA\n\nThey need to consider your emotional needs a bit more at this time. Yes, they want you there with them, but it's not always about what they want. Sometimes compromise means completely giving the other person what they need in that moment and setting your needs aside because the other person's are so much greater.", "Neither of you is the AH. You need to cope and be alone to process things. I suspect she\u2019s concerned about you and wants you not to be alone. You\u2019re talking past each other with your needs and desires in an emotionally difficult time.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. NAH", "NAH\n\nUnless you've given her any reason previously for her to worry about you doing something to yourself.", "NTA. It's not about her not wanting to leave YOU alone; it's about HER not wanting to be alone. You wanting some time to yourself is entirely reasonable, even without the context of your mother passing.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. You're definitely NTA. Grieving is a highly personal process, and everyone copes differently. Your partner may have the best intentions, but it's essential for her to understand and respect your need for solitude during this difficult time. Take the time you need and allow yourself to grieve in your way.", " NTA. Grief is too personal to assume that any of us will have the same responses to any loss.\n\nAnd I do know that its hard sometimes to manage someone determined to help you who isn't actually aware that you need to design this for yourself. So, gently tell her your truth. \"I am looking forward to the quiet where I can think about my life with my mom - not just that she's gone. I'm grateful you want to help me. But, what you want to do for me isn't what I need from you right now. I don't think anyone *knows* how they are going to feel until they get to this place. Right now, I need a space to cross over. I need to self soothe and just reflect. I am who I am in so many ways because of my mom. I want to find the space to appreciate that right now. You could really help me by giving me room to do that. Thanks so much for wanting to support me.\"\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. Truly. You get to be honest now and explain this is no rejection of your GF. Explain that all of us grieve differently. And support of someone's grief can take many different forms, but its always based on that individual's actual needs.", "NTA. You and your partner grieve differently. If this happened to her she would want your company. Have you laid it out for her like you did for us? It's not hard to understand that some people just need to have no outside stimulation to come to terms with their grief. See if you can talk to her again, tell her you are grateful for her support, but this part of the journey is yours alone. Good luck", "NAH she is worried about leaving you on your own while you're going through one of the worst times of your life. Compromise and schedule regular phone calls because total silence will make anyone worry.  I don't know how to answer to your question about if it cuts to something deeper.", "NTA\n\nSupporting you is her letting you grieve your way, not her demanding that you do things to make her more comfortable.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds to me like she thinks that even though you feel like you want to be alone right now, she's worried that that isn't what is *best* for you.\n\ne.g. When people are depressed, they often want to be alone, but being with other people is much better for depression, even though it feels like a chore. Depression isn't the same thing as grief, but I'd wager that this is what's going through her mind and she's trying to push you not to be alone because she's afraid that'll be worse for your mental health. Whether she's right about that is anyone's guess.", "In the nicest way possible, ESH. Your partner, yes she is supportive but she has to listen to your needs and understand that you want to be alone, which is understandable. You are NTA for wanting to be alone, but you both made this into an argument, so clearly there is some miscommunication happening on such a small issue that you both are actually in the same boat in. ESH for this.", "NTA\n\nYour need to be alone and process is completely natural. \n\nThis grieving period, especially now so soon after you lost your mother, should be about allowing you to be yourself, and feel comfortable telling her what you need.  If your gf genuinely wants to support you, she needs to listen, even if she can't relate, or would respond differently given the same situation.", "NTA.  She is the AH.  People grieve in different ways and it's perfectly normal to want space and time alone.", "NTA. She needs to understand that only you know what you need right HR now. Grief is weird- it manifests in different ways for different people. \n\nIf she keeps pushing, it\u2019s worth telling her that while you know she means well, she is effectively telling you that SHE understands your emotional state more than you do and that SHE knows best. I doubt she actually wants that to be the message she\u2019s sending.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Sending you strength.", "I remember my siblings insisting we all needed to be together in the weeks and months after we lost our dad. (No. We don't all actually need a hive mentality or a team playbook on that score. I just didn't have the energy to make them understand that we all needed something different, and our needs would change sometimes even as we worked through our own processes.)", "OP is telling her she's not right about that. How dare she try to tell OP what's best for him as if he doesn't know. She needs to step aside and respect his wishes.", "Grief is not the same as depression.", "I don\u2019t see how they have \u201cboth\u201d made this into an argument. OP knows what he wants to do. His girlfriend thinks she knows better. Is he creating an argument by not giving in to her desires? Or is she creating one by steamrolling him?", "Maybe, but they've been in a supportive relationship for 13 years, so she probably knows him pretty well, and she may have a reason to suspect that he's not right about what is best for him right now. \n\nShe might be wrong or might not, but she's not an AH for trying to convince him to do what she thinks will help him most as long as she doesn't try to force him.", "I know. I literally said that. It's an analogy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Depression isn't the same thing as grief", "I am not saying OP is the one who created the argument, I am only suggesting they both made the argument happen on something that was fine but turned out to not be. Someone has likely not explained well enough his reasoning, and someone is likely over-worried about her husband (you never know what happens when someone is in a low mood). So it is very likely both should be held accountable for this."]}
