If he could not live with you and share your life as a spouse because of his anger issues, why should he live with you in any other capacity?  \n\nYou did not make his friends put him out. That was their decision. It does not matter that it was based on you telling the truth. They could have chosen to let him stay, but you have no power over that choice. \nYes it will be hard because you seem to be a good honest person, but you have to let it go. I doubt anyone ever prospered by bringing a source of extreme negativity into their life.", "NTA. Look after yourself and your child, don't let him into your home. It's not up to you to house him.", "NTA.. Definitly NOT your problem. He isn't going to change and as you've already said, you do not want him around your child with his anger issues. If you let him stay he will not only show his bad side again, but add guilt to it, by saying it's all your fault he has no place to stay. DO NOT allow him into your home, now or ever. Take it from an old lady who's been through that same kind of situation.", "NTA.  Do NOT let him move in.  Depending on where you live he might get squatters rights and you won\u2019t be able to get rid of him.  Think about the safety you and your child.", "NTA - you own this angry man nothing.  What could possibly make you think you owe someone who has shown you \"extreme anger issues\" a home?  On what planet is it a good idea to bring this man around your minor child?  \n\nWhy do you feel responsible?  That's insane.  Just block him and cut him off.  He's no longer your issue.  He's just trying to manipulate you back.  And the attitude that \"I need to care for him\" is going to ruin your life and your child's life.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would you even consider endangering yourself and your kid like that?", "There is a reason that he's the X.", "If he moves in, you\u2019ll have huge problems getting him out again. Don\u2019t put your child in an awful posit with him\n\nNTA", "NTA - Please don\u2019t take him into your child\u2019s home", "NTA and for the love of all, DO NOT let him move in. That is a tragedy waiting to happen, and endangering your child.\n\nHe unhoused himself, you are not to blame.", "Nta. He's  grown a** man he can get a job and go to a shelter", "This \u261d\ufe0f OP do not let him stay. If he is homeless that is his problem, not yours. Tell him to leave and change the locks so he cannot get back in. You'd only be an AH if you let someone with anger issues stay sharing a home with you and your daughter.", "It will turn into a situation where she can't get him out. He will make it a nightmare for her when she finally tries to get him out. He'll figure it out.", "Cannot agree with this comment enough!\n\nOP, NTA. Do NOT let a potentially harmful person come to live in your home, *especially* when you have a minor living there too.\n\nYou're not responsible for your ex-f being homeless, *he* is through his lies and deceit. He is the one who damaged his friendship to that point, you were just honest with his friends.\n\nStay safe, and do not let this man into your home or your life again.", "And if he had a key, even if he returned it - CHANGE THE LOCKS.", "The Narcissist love bombs you in the beginning, and then when they think they have you, the masks begin to slip. Narcissists always have stories of how crazy & bad their families/Exs/friends/bosses/teachers/everyone else are & how they are the victim. They want you to get caught in the nurturing trap of feeling sorry for them & trying to save them. They will start of saying you are the only one who understands them & switch up to 'are you going to abandon me to' or 'it's you fault for finding out the truth & trying to hold them accountable'.... \n\nEducate yourself on narcissist behaviors, strategies & relationships. Their is a wealth of material on social media platforms & Google. You will find validation & freedom in education", "Exactly", "lol never heard that term before!", "I\u2019m in no way shape or form desperate. I unfortunately fell victim to his guilt tripping ways and I did believe he could/would change. Once he didn\u2019t, I left.", "This person like most on here are leaving out a big part of the story", "Better known as a Hobosexual.", "Did you miss the part where I left 3 days after the engagement?", "I wouldn't do that.  In some places, that might be enough to establish residency.", "35?? I get the 3 years but 35's extreme", "Yeah, because him lying to manipulate is her fault for finding out the truth. Her being supportive & defending her partner to a group of supposed abusive friends, but instead learning her was just playing victim to manipulate her is all her fault. /s Lol.. that's some serious Flying Monkey logic...blame & gaslight the victim & defend the liar/abuser. \n\nYou learned to be a people pleasing Flying Monkey in grade school?  You should re-education yourself and unlearn those destructive behaviors.", "Serve him notice to vacate and a deadline. If he is abusive call the police and have him removed.", "Wow reading this brought back memories and made me realize that my childhood friend was a narcissist. She manipulated her way into our house, got me kicked out and then tried to replace me with my parents. My mom fell for it hook line and sinker.", ">never heard that term before!\n\nNo one loves you more or quicker than someone with no place to live..lol", "I speak from experience when I tell you you need to be a lot more judicious going forward when exposing your child to volatile partners. You shouldn't even be *remotely* considering letting this man into your home and around your child. The fact that the kid has *already* seen this man get aggressive with you should have been *more than enough* to end the relationship.", "Don't get with someone thinking they will change. It's so unlikely to happen.\n\nThree months is too soon to be introducing dates to your kid. You need to be sure the person is mature enough to be around your kid and three months is way too soon for that.", "I love that phrase.", "But you also knew after 3 months of his horrible behavior, yet you made the *choice* to continue the relationship, and worse deep its commitment by being engaged..\n\nThis man was sleeping on a friends couch, when you became engaged to him. You knew he couldn\u2019t house himself when you agreed to marriage, on top of his already less than stellar behavior.\n\nHe is not great, but you should hold yourself accountable for the fact that your decision making was also bad.", "No, I did not.  Still, it got that far to begin with."]}
