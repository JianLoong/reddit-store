Insisting that it's your job as a woman to look pretty is, at its core, reducing you to an object that has to be as desirable as possible. Yuck. But also, I think it's important to understand that she probably actually does think that her instructions are what's best for you and it might feel to her like you reacting that way is a rejection of her love.

I would say that your parents ATA for not accepting the fact that you are growing up in a different culture and generation, but at the same time they still have the right to practice whatever culture they want. The only problem is that if they never come around, you'll have to accept that their culture and views are different from yours. I had to do that with my parents, who are both conservative and tend to be extremely old fashioned. After years of fighting, it was never going to change. The culture someone is raised in is a part of their identity, and sometimes when you ask someone to change that they feel as if you're telling them to change their identity. But respect also goes both ways. If they can't respect the fact that you don't agree with them, then you shouldn't be obligated to respect them either.", "[deleted]", "NTA but I understand different cultures have different beliefs and I think she's sticking to her culture.

It's frankly something they'd say is humiliating/a loss of face(hard to translate but losing face is kinda like saying losing your reputation or self esteem/pride/honor) and that the usual route is either sweeping things under the rug because \"They're old and they are still owed respect./You're young so it's not your place to call people out.\" or telling them one on one in private but telling them in a respectful manner(they won't listen otherwise haha and I am in agreement that people should be afforded respect even in disagreements/fights unless they're irredeemable assholes).\n\nIn this case I feel like it's more that you told her off in a kind of public area instead of the thing you said which can be very embarrassing.
