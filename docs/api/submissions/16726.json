{"id": 16726, "submission_id": "13bvfb0", "title": "AITA for not allowing my family to visit my mother with Alzheimer\u2019s?", "selftext": "My (54M) mother (77F) lives in a dementia care facility. She has been living there for a little over two years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s about 4 years ago. My brother Todd (51M) has always been mom\u2019s favorite. He didn\u2019t move out of her house until his early 30s because of his \u201cmental health issues\u201d. He was always a bit of party-goer and spent his early 20s getting high and relying on our parents to take care of him. Because of this, our mom has always been over-protective of him and has always catered to his every need. When our father passed away in 2014, our mom signed paperwork to make me her Power-of-Attorney when she were to need it because I have always been more responsible and mature than Todd and he could not be trusted with that responsibility. \n\nA little over a week ago, Todd visited our mom and a few days later I visited her. When I was at the facility, a nurse told me that my mom did not recognize Todd and was upset someone she did not know was in her room. I then told the facility\u2019s administrator that she is to not have any visitors other than me. As her POA, I feel it is my responsibility to make sure she feels safe and happy where she lives. Since she does not recognize family a lot of the time and could get upset when someone she doesn\u2019t recognize is in her room, I told the facility staff to not allow any visitors except for me and my wife. We are the ones who see her the most and are the ones that are most involved with her care. \n\nThis is not something I wanted to do, but it\u2019s what I felt I had to do to preserve my mom\u2019s happiness as much as possible. Now my brother and his daughters (my nieces) have been calling and texting me constantly for the past week calling me an asshole for not allowing them to see their mom/grandma. I explained to them that this isn\u2019t about them, it\u2019s about my mom and what is best for her. But they are not understanding that and insist they should be able to visit her even if they do not recognize her. I offered to have them video call her (the facility has tablets they let residents use to video call family) but they said that\u2019s not the same and are still calling me an asshole for not allowing them to visit. \n\nI think it is my job to do what\u2019s best for my mom, and having visitors in her room that she does not recognize is clearly upsetting to her, but all of the backlash from my family has made me second guess. AITA?\n\nEdit: since this has come up a lot, my brother and his family are welcome to visit my mom with me there. They do not like this solution because my brother works nights and it is hard for us to find times when we are all available. I offered to have set times a couple days a month that we all go visit together but they are against that and insist on being able to visit whenever.", "created_utc": 1683559764, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13bvfb0/aita_for_not_allowing_my_family_to_visit_my/", "score": 950, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her illness shouldn't be used against her to further isolate her, after all. (The treatment plan for my relative with dementia has revolved around reminding her of things she knows in an effort to keep her \"present.\")\n\nSo, YTA. I can't make sense of the cruelty you feel is \"helpful\" to your mom. She's going to have good and bad days. And keeping people who love her away from her can make the bad times much worse.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR MOTHER'S DOCTORS ADVISING YOU TO DO?", "INFO: what are you planning to do if the time comes when she no longer recognizes you?", "YTA. How cruel of you to not let your brother and other family members see your mom. How vile of you to exercise the power you have to take that from them. What you did is disgusting because people with dementia have good and bad days. She might not recognise him at times but doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t every time. Sounds like you feel bitter about your brother being favoured or babied by your mom and now you are just trying to hurt him as revenge.", "Wait, he visited once and she didn't respond well so you banned everyone? People with dementia have a lot of fluctuations. I worked on a dementia floor for 5 years. There were some days that the patient wouldn't recognize their wife who came in every single day and would get upset. The next day they were perfectly fine. It happens unfortunately.\n\nI am very sorry your mom has this. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But YTA here", "YTA. Patients with dementia, Alzheimer's, etc may not recognize a relative one day, and then recognize them fine the next day. Cutting them off abruptly is not in your mother's best interest. \nHere are some things you could do instead: talk to them and to her care team about what to do in case she doesn't recognize someone, try to work out if there are better times of the day for a visit or routines that help with such interactions (again, involve the care team), or do nothing yet and observe if it repeats.", "YTA for going straight to \"don't let them visit\" instead of looking for any other solution---including the obvious one, to coordinate your visits with his.\n\nPlenty of Alzheimer patients don't recognize their family. The usual response from nurses/others is to say \"It's Joe, Grandma.  I'm your grandson\" or whatever.", "Yup YTA. Probably a few hundred other things that could have been done before cutting a son off from his mother. It\u2019s actually pretty cruel.", "This basically \"how to make sure mom dies all alone and scared 101 while also pissing off extended family members because you're using mom as a pawn and are isolating her\".

If my mom wouldn't be able to recognize me anymore, I'd actually be very upset and hurt. For my sister to then declare: \"Hey no more visits\" would be even worse.", "YTA! Stopping your mom from having visitors is cruel to her and everybody involved. My mom didn't recognize me during the last years of her life. That does mean my visits were meaningless to her.", "YTA. Dementia is hard on everyone. Your brother and his family have just as much right to see your mom as you do. How long your brother lived with your parents or what his issues were 30 years ago are not relevant.\n\nPeople with dementia have good and bad days and you can\u2019t rob your brother of his mother just because she got upset once. \n\nThis will only get worse. When, one day, she doesn\u2019t recognize you, will you leave and never go back?\n\nEdit typos", "YTA: there's no reason why they can't visit with you. There are so many ways to reprompt memories in someone with alzheimers. \"Hey mum, this is x. Do you remember when you used to do y together? Or your favourite song together was this?\" That would help with the fear, and let your mums family to see her. \n\nForgetting someone on one visit is not enough to black list everyone but yourself from visiting.", "INFO: in most memory care units one of the methods of care is to have photos of family, friends, and staff along with names on the wall for the person as gentle reminders of the people they know.

Alzheimers can be hard on family and loved ones, and incredibly isolating.", "YTA unless you think any of your family has truly bad intentions. These visits can be beneficial and you could have tried a million other things like moving the visits elsewhere, one person at a time, etc. Reintroducing yourself to your loved one is painful but it's better than going nuclear", "YTA This is absolutely not the standard recommendation for care. Family members may need to be counseled about how to best support your mother and the best ways to interact with her in ways that minimize stress, but they absolutely do not need to be kept away from her.", "I dont know anything about dementia care but I feel it's cruel to cut off your brother from his mom. Maybe you can ask the nurses for more help mentally preparing your mom for a visitor, ask them for the best times to visit, and limit visits to once a week or something. I get that he was a slacker/mooch but that really won't have any affect on your mother now that you're her POA.

Ever.  \n\nYour brother and his family deserve to spend time with her same as you.  How about you compromise and go with them when they visit so you can help settle your Mom and reintroduce the family to her?", "YTA. \n\nThis seems unusually cruel. Your mother (were she in possession/full control of her faculties) would be extremely upset that anyone would keep her loving family members away from her. There are bad days and this is one of those bad days. If you keep your brother and others away from her because of this, you will sow a lot of resentment. \n\nHighly recommend speaking with the doctors about how to handle this and maybe even a therapist or mediator. None of these decisions are easy and sometimes a third-party can be extremely helpful with navigating.", "A person with Alzheimer's might forget a person one day and remember them the next so it seems extreme to deny your mom the opportunity to interact with family solely because she can't remember them. If they are upsetting her b/c of their toxic personalities, then you are justified. \n\nBut if she was just startled cause she didn't recognize them, then you could escort them or have staff introduce them with instructions to interact as friendly strangers if she doesn't recognize them that day.\n\nOne day she might not recognize you, then are you going to ban yourself?  NAH.", "Yta. Shame on you for not letting your brother and family spend any time with their dying loved one", "INFO: Did you speak to the staff at the memory care facility about this? I find it absurd that you seem to have unilaterally decided to make an extreme decision like this without apparently consulting the numerous experts you must have at your disposal if she's in a facility that specifically caters to dementia. \n\nAsk the facility specifically for some support here.", "Dementia (whether Alzheimer's or otherwise) is maybe the most horrifying disease there is. There are never any good options or happy endings with these stories. On one hand, you are your mother's POA. You are responsible for making caregiving decisions that are in her best interests, and those best interests may increasingly not align with the desires of her family. On the other hand, at least as far as I can tell from this account, you cut off visitation access to the rest of her family after one bad interaction -- dementia changes from day to day, and at some point, it's going to be *you* that has that bad interaction -- and without even informing them first, and that's pretty crappy. \n\nI'm not in a position to say whether the decision you made is the right one. But I **will** say that you probably need to be involving your brother and his family *at least* in discussions about your mother's situation and her end-of-life care, even if you ultimately make choices that they do not approve of. **Also**, her care facility will absolutely have family counseling services that you and your brother can and should both benefit from and that can help inform your future decisions about how to best support your mother's remaining quality of life. I guarantee that they have prior experience in these sorts of situations. **Ask. For. Help.** \n\nI'm going to say NAH, *barely*, for now. I don't think you've handled the situation very well, *especially* from your brother's perspective, but I don't think that makes you an *asshole*, because this is an awful situation that no one is ever prepared to deal with. But you're going to have more hard decisions to make going forward, and you've got to balance a lot of competing perspectives when making them, and shutting the rest of your family out indefinitely *will* make you the asshole. I'm sorry that you have to deal with all of this, and I'm sorry for your mother. Dementia is a terrible thing for everyone involved. Good luck.", "The gentlest of YTAs. You're trying to act from a good place, but I don't think this is the way.\n\nShe may forget someone today and remember them tomorrow. The nature of her illness is that things are going to be upsetting for her sometimes, and you can't control that or protect her from all possible sources of upset. The day may come when a visit from you causes her confusion and distress, and that doesn't mean you should never see her from that point. It means her illness makes things very sad and difficult sometimes.", "YTA, how are you going to keep her son from seeing her. It\u2019s selfish of you.", "YTA. And does she always not recognize them or just sometime? Do you plan to stop visiting when she doesn\u2019t recognize you? Why the backstory on your brother? Do you hold a grudge? POA is not meant to be abused by keeping loved ones from visiting. You owe your family a serious discussion about what is really the best way for your family to proceed. \nAlzheimer\u2019s is incredibly painful to witness as a loved one.", "Yta.  POA is a  tough role, so don't be too rough on yourself as this horrible disease progresses. Your extended family should be involved so you can take a break when needed. \n Bring in labeled family pictures for your poor mom to refer to. Or ask your bro to organize pictures of him and his with labels that show names and how your mom knows them. Large print is key.", "I can\u2019t make a judgment, this is terribly sad. It's easy for people to say Y T A, because it's easy to be a kitchen psychologist. Maybe look into some alternatives.", "YTA. Why can't you or your wife bring them to visit?", "YTA \n\nIt feels more like you're doing this as some petty ass revenge thing (\"look who mom loves best now brother \") then looking out for your mother.  \nKeeping Family,  other than you and your spouse, away is cruel.  You know there are times when people with Alzheimer's are very lucid and very in the now. How do you think your mother is going to feel if she realizes her son's never came to visit? Or was that your plan? To make it seem like he doesn't care when she is lucid and she realizes he hasn't been there? Shame on you", "YTA\n\nTodd was a stranger to her last visit but at any moment she could ask why he isn\u2019t visiting her anymore. Dementia doesn\u2019t have a predictable arc; we don\u2019t know when the moments of clarity will last or for how long. What you are doing is cruel to both parties, you just don\u2019t realize it yet.", "YTA\n\nYou hate your brother, you resent him for being the favorite child so at the first opportunity you took your revenge on him. \n\nDon\u2019t lie to yourself and the rest of the world that it\u2019s about \u201cmy mom\u201d happiness.

Will you just leave her alone without care? \n\nIt feels like there were other steps that could\u2019ve been taken before leaping to \u201cno one but me and my wife can visit my mom\u201d especially if your brother works nights and can\u2019t easily visit her the same time you can.\n\nEDIT TO ADD- Are you prepared for your brother and his family to never talk to you again? Because that could very well happen if you stick to your guns about this.", "INFO: When she no longer recognizes you will you stop visiting?", "My grandmother is about as old as your mother, and she is also in a care facility with Alzheimer's. She barely recognises me, and I was very much a \"grandmother's boy\".  She has no idea who I am.  Sometimes, she calls me by her husband's name.  Even when he's there with me.  I've been there every day for the last few years, I've helped with caring for her, I've even taken her to the bathroom when she's needed to go, so any man who looks out for her wellbeing must obviously have her husband's name because he's always been there for her.  She's ok with me because - I believe - she feels she can trust me.  She might forget my name, but she hasn't forgotten how I make her feel.\n\nMy mother, in comparison, hasn't even called her for the last five years.  She hasn't visited since my grandmother - her mother - was admitted.  She says that she can't afford transport to visit (which makes no sense, but I'll explain why later) otherwise she would, but she doesn't even call my grandfather, her father.  She can't even pick up the phone to find out how her mother is.  Not even my grandfather having a stroke was enough to warrant a phone call.  She's only a little older than you.\n\nHer daughter - my sister - visits every week.  She'll bring one or sometimes both of her children with her.  My grandmother loves babies.  She always lights up when she sees a kid running around.  Some people are natural mothers, I say she's a natural grandmother.  She also phones my grandfather twice a week as a minimum to find out how her grandmother is doing.\n\nShe also lives around the corner from my mother.  So when I said my mother can't afford to visit, my sister can.  My sister visits at the same time, on the same day, and asks whether my mother wants to come along.  And still my mother hasn't visited.  At that point, it's a conscious decision.  My older aunt lives practically on the other side of the country, but she has visited more than my mother.  My younger aunt visits weekly.  They call often.  They talk, they check on my grandfather, they make sure everything is ok.  When my grandfather took ill, my younger aunt and I helped clean and redecorate his house.\n\nIt would be a cold day in Hell before my grandfather ever told any of us that we couldn't visit.  He would rather die than deny us the ability to visit our family.  If my grandmother acted as you describe with my mother or my sister or my aunts or even me, he would do whatever he could to make sure my grandmother was comfortable, but even then would do whatever he could to make sure we were able to visit.  She's family.  We're all family.\n\nYou went nuclear and banned ANYONE but you from seeing her.  Yes, your mother got upset over Todd, but you weren't even prepared to do anything to help alleviate that fear.  You weren't prepared to visit your mother with Todd, to show that he can be trusted and help her feel she can trust him.  You weren't prepared to try to help them to see each other in another location.  Surely the facility has a communal meeting space like a garden or a dining room.  You didn't even try that.  You jumped immediately to \"Nobody else can see her but me.\"\n\nYou are absolutely TA.  Your mother is ill and may have lost a lot of her understanding, and I know you would move Heaven and Earth to make her happy and comfortable.  But you weren't even prepared to discuss alternatives with the staff there, staff who will have seen this before and will know how to make visitation possible.  You immediately said that her son was forbidden from visiting, with no discussion with him, no discussion with the staff, no looking for alternatives, nothing.  How pissed would you feel if the tables were turned and Todd said that to you?  He dictates that you are banned from ever seeing your mother under the auspices of \"I'm her Power of Attorney, I need to make sure she's safe\", do you expect me to believe you'd be totally fine with it?\n\nYou are the asshole.  The only reason I can see that you would immediately jump to banning him is that something happened between you and Todd, and now that you are in that position of power and the facility have to listen to you, you are taking full advantage of it.  It's not about your mother's wellbeing.  It's not about your mother's safety.  It's you on a power trip, for whatever reason that may be.", "Oooo the power my precious, the power. YTA.", "you're terrible", "YTA. I understand what you're doing and why, but remember that it's his mother too. He deserves the right to see her and obtain the closure for when the time finally comes. \n\nIts good that you've tried to make an accommodation, but the damage is done. People with alzheimers can have random moments of clarity, and he deserves the chance to be there for one. \n\nJust ask yourself what your mother would want if she were lucid. I'm willing to bet she would never tell you to bar her own son from visiting her.", "YTA.  Its pretty clear you don't like your brother and are now using this opportunity to stick it to him.   Not recognizing people intermittently is a progression of this disease and limiting visits is a wildly unreasonable and cruel way to handle this,  not just for your brother,  but for your mother who will get less visits because of it.", "Soft YTA- While your mother might have not remembered him at the moment, she might remember him the next. As someone who had two grandparents with Alzheimer\u2019s/dementia they can fluctuate between forgetting and remembering. I understand your concern that you don\u2019t want to upset her and not having people she doesn\u2019t recognize in her room, the truth of it is that those nurses and care givers are strangers to her too. She\u2019s comfortable now because she sees them often which can change at any moment. What would you do at that point? Would you bring her home? If your brother, nieces, etc\u2026 are able to visit often, she could possibly gain that comfort with them as well. There are always good and bad days but when you have a good day it\u2019s a blessing. By not letting family visit her it\u2019s like those good days aren\u2019t important. There are so many people suffering with Alzheimer\u2019s whose family doesn\u2019t visit them because of the disease and here it\u2019s the complete opposite. I really hope you let the family visit her when they are able. Also, I recommend some free informational sessions that you can take to help educate you further on the disease. Wishing you all well in this difficult journey.", "You sound just like my aunt.

It's about your mom. \n\nI worked with Alzheimer's and Dementia residents for over 10 years. That mind is a scary place to live. It's not about them getting to visit grandma. She isn't grandma anymore. She's a frightened old woman who doesn't know them. Soon she may forget you. As long as she's comfortable and happy to have you visit it's okay. \n\nThey shouldn't visit all together. That's too much stimulation.

You, your name. Todd, his picture. Mom. Dad. \nFamily. Your family home. Etc. Something for you to look at together.

He should be more than willing to visit *with you* to help smooth the visit. His unwillingness to do that sounds suspect \n\nETA: My close friend's Grandmother was in a facility similar to your Mom; she was in full dementia but she was the happiest, friendliest woman ever-to everyone. Your visitors,  her visitors, it didn't matter. She suddenly changed and became suspicious of young people. All of them.

I believe you made that decision thinking it was in your mother's best interest, but I also think there are other, better solutions that would not involve cutting your brother off from his mother, cutting her from him, and also cutting off the granddaughters from their grandmother.\n\nShe didn't recognize him \u2014 that time. Next time she may well recognize him. Then a week later she might not recognize *you*.

They can still have visit with her. If she remains convinced they're strangers, she can be told they're lonely and want to play checkers with her or listen to music with her or look through photo albums with her. \n\nEven people with dementia who don't recognize anybody get lonely and *need* human companionship.

My father is in memory care and I beg and plead with siblings and others to visit him. Occasionally, a visitor may confuse or upset him, in which case it is a short visit. Most of the time, visitors are a god send. Especially if they bring treats (my dad loves a sweet snack) or read to him or take him for a walk.

Do that 12 times in 3 months and Mom might feel less agitated to visit with them alone. Then they can go visit by themselves IF Mom reacts positively.

She has been living there for a little over two years after being diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s about 4 years ago. My brother Todd (51M) has always been mom\u2019s favorite. He didn\u2019t move out of her house until his early 30s because of his \u201cmental health issues\u201d. He was always a bit of party-goer and spent his early 20s getting high and relying on our parents to take care of him. Because of this, our mom has always been over-protective of him and has always catered to his every need. When our father passed away in 2014, our mom signed paperwork to make me her Power-of-Attorney when she were to need it because I have always been more responsible and mature than Todd and he could not be trusted with that responsibility. \n\nA little over a week ago, Todd visited our mom and a few days later I visited her. When I was at the facility, a nurse told me that my mom did not recognize Todd and was upset someone she did not know was in her room. I then told the facility\u2019s administrator that she is to not have any visitors other than me. As her POA, I feel it is my responsibility to make sure she feels safe and happy where she lives. Since she does not recognize family a lot of the time and could get upset when someone she doesn\u2019t recognize is in her room, I told the facility staff to not allow any visitors except for me and my wife. We are the ones who see her the most and are the ones that are most involved with her care. \n\nThis is not something I wanted to do, but it\u2019s what I felt I had to do to preserve my mom\u2019s happiness as much as possible. Now my brother and his daughters (my nieces) have been calling and texting me constantly for the past week calling me an asshole for not allowing them to see their mom/grandma. I explained to them that this isn\u2019t about them, it\u2019s about my mom and what is best for her. But they are not understanding that and insist they should be able to visit her even if they do not recognize her. I offered to have them video call her (the facility has tablets they let residents use to video call family) but they said that\u2019s not the same and are still calling me an asshole for not allowing them to visit. \n\nI think it is my job to do what\u2019s best for my mom, and having visitors in her room that she does not recognize is clearly upsetting to her, but all of the backlash from my family has made me second guess. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "INFO: Can't you bring him with you? She isn't going to think a stranger broke into her house if he's with you and she's comfortable with you, right?", "YTA - because that whole backstory on your brother shows you have an issue with him and that this is more about him than protecting your mom. \n\nThere\u2019s other solutions that can be put in place that aren\u2019t blocking everyone from visiting their mom/grandma except you.", "YTA", "Soft YTA. At least your brother is making an effort. My mom had Alzheimer's and my brother had to be browbeaten into visiting her.

She is his mother same as yours, and depriving him of the ability to visit his own mother is an AH move on your part.  Do you plan to ban yourself she she no linger remembers you?", "YTA. I cannot imagine this is a medically recommended way to handle this - the nurse told you as an update to where your mother is in her process, not to have you isolate her.\n\nPeople with dementia have good and bad days, and good and bad times. She should continue to have visitors who know her, both to keep her connected to her memory and to help her be socialized and stimulated. \n\nI disagree with posters saying to require them to visit with you there - there's no reason to cut them off like that. The obvious next steps are to 1) not change anything because this is a natural progression of her disease, 2) have them try to visit during her good times of day, and 3) suggest they meet with her in the public areas of her facility so she's less concerned about her home, but this might not even help because her fear isn't even rational.", "YTA. You need to make sure that any guests keep reassuring your mother who they are, stop preventing them from visiting. I\u2019ve had parents, in laws, and grandparents with dementia.

I watched my grandmother go through this 20 years ago and you are completely in the wrong.  Your post seems like you are punishing your brother rather than protecting your mother.  Eventually your mother won't recognize you either.  When that happens will you be banned from visiting her?  After all it's about mother's comfort and she gets upset when strangers are in her room.  I'm guessing that situation would play out differently.  Stop gatekeeping because it's not helpful and will only drive your brother away and when your mom is gone he will be too.  At the very least, it's good to have a second set of eyes.  Alzheimer's/dementia patients tend to be difficult and hospitals over medicate them to make it easier to deal with.  The hospital over medicated my grandmother so much she developed Tardive dyskinesia because they gave her too much Haldol.", "YTA. You clearly don\u2019t understand how Alzheimer\u2019s works. No two days are the same- not recognizing someone one day doesn\u2019t mean anything about how the next day will be. Instead of isolating your mother and cutting off her family, try working with the nurses and family to develop a strategy for how to approach days when she is upset. even on days when she doesn\u2019t know who they are she may still enjoy company in a common area of the faculty or at a meal. Your power trip is astounding.", "YTA. Is this is coming from me someone who took care of my grandfather when his dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s got really bad. I was a senior in high school. You are COMPLETELY the ahole because those moments are at most times VERY FLEETING and it could\u2019ve been just a bad day.

I'm currently dealing with a mother with dementia and can't fathom isolating her from other family members despite frequently being the only one she remembers. It's very common for alzheimer patients to forget family, and it sometimes changes from visit to visit. She may very well recognize your brother and his family next time. She may never recognize them. It doesn't matter. But all of your comments are about his \"lifestyle choices\" when he was in his 20's, him being your mom's favorite, and referring to his mental health from decades ago. You sound incredibly vindictive. Let your mom, her son, and her grandchildren have their relationship for whatever time she has left. THEIR relationship, not with you in the middle of their visits. Facility staff should be used to helping patients experiencing temporary distress due to memory loss. They don't need you isolating her.", "YTA I'm a caregiver at a memory care unit and an assisted living facility...

You would stop her visits altogether. What you are doing is trying to \u201cfix\u201d Alzheimer\u2019s on your own. This is a horrible disease. Your mother will likely stop recognizing her own carers, so she is going to be surrounded by \u201cstrangers\u201d regardless. The fact is, her decline will not be pleasant, for anybody. But by cutting everyone who loves her off, you\u2019re guaranteeing that your mom\u2019s disease is going to be more horrific for everyone else, too.

But she absolutely loves seeing my little kids, and being near babies. She forgets that they're her great grandkids but is just joyful in being around them. Someone doesn't necessarily have to recognise people to enjoy their company, and that might need to be the goal of visits. The occassional meltdown is to be expected, but unless the family member is unwilling to try to find a good solution, they shouldn't just be blanket cut off from their parent (exceptions obviously- noone she didn't want to visit her when she was with it should be overly welcome, and noone unsafe obviously).", "As someone who has worked in long-term care for years, including on locked dementia units, you are wrong and YTA.", "YTA.

It may not be possible to satisfy all these goals, but you have to try to see what you can come up with in discussion with your brother and his family and the medical staff.\n\nMy guess is your brother is viewing this as just an example of you trying to control him, when you may not actually be trying to do that in this case.

Talk about what can be done. And amazingly enough it should be simple.  Knock and introduce yourself (leave out the relation) and ask to come have a visit.

Common practice is to validate their feelings, be empathetic to their confusion, and proceed in a way comfortable to them. Banning family like this is an abuse of your POA.

They may not recognize someone one day but then see them the next and know them. They also can mistake someone for someone else and again a little later know who they are. They often dont remember these moments or know they made a mistake. She very well could be sitting there all day wondering why her family doesn't visit her and wonder what she did to them. People with Alzheimer's also often struggle with emotion regulation. They can get really worked up really quick over someone trivial like giving them more juice without asking. That also means they can calm down extremely quickly as well and literally forget anything happened.", "It isn\u2019t just your mom you are affecting, this is about the rest of your family too.

Isolating her is actually the worst thing in the world for her.", "You should let them visit while you are there as well so you can help calm your mom down if she gets upset. They need to learn how to deal with her, and you can teach them. It's normal for your mom to get upset because she doesn't recognize someone because that's common with dementia.

It is not right for you to cut your brother off from his mother simply because of a bad day. He should be allowed to go regularly because one day might be better than the previous.

Alzheimers is a very complicated degenerative disease, and it is generally harder on family than it is on those afflicted. I understand that you want your mother to be happy, comfortable, and not upset. However when you enacted your ban of your brother you are actively engaging in harming him and his daughters. This can complicate their grieving and acceptance processes. A more helpful approach would be to educate them about the disease and suggest that they come in with you to help keep her calm and show her the pictures to help her see their relationship to her. It could help rebuild familiarity and after time they could visit without you. Also communicating something like \"if she gets upset because you're there you need to quietly leave\". \n\nAs long as they aren't engaging in forms of abuse (harming physically, stealing, or other forms), it is important to be cognizant that emotional upset is part of the disease and can be the result of anyone or anything in her room. As it progresses these emotional upsets can become more common. Right now you're taking away any chance they have of still making memories for themselves and preparing emotionally for when she dies. \n\nYou're being protective and concerned and from what you said doing a good job of taking care of her, but you've been just a little overzealous. You should reach out to her care team and physicians and make a plan that can incorporate visits from other members that want to see her. For everyone's benefit.\n\n*Edit:\n\nAfter reading through some more of your responses I see now that you have actually offered to do most of my suggestions and it seems like your brother and his daughters mostly don't understand what's going on and how severe it is.

You are hurting her.", "Oh I don't feel qualified to say you are or you aren't an AH. I have not been in your shoes but think that because your mom does not recognize other family members, her care team should be more involved. This sounds like a tough situation so do your best. You are being a good to your mom and that should be all that matters.", "How sad. He may not be the best brother in the world, or even the best son, but he IS her son and she IS his mom. I think this is more about your issues with your brother. So yes, YTA.", "So when your mom stops recognizing you you're just gonna stop all visits?  I worked at a dementia home and let me tell you only one person had visitors on the regular and it was sad.  Of course everyone has good and bad days but it was awesome to see the one person who would come and visit every single week.  Let your mom have visitors.  They can just go there and color with her or do other simple projects.  Let her spend time with people, even if it's just to sit with her and flip through magazines.

You're bitterness from having to be the responsible one while your brother was favored is showing. It's never a good idea to lash out because you're hurting. You're mom isn't going to recover from the dementia and you're robbing your family of their last time with her. It's not a good look. \n\nThat being said, I do think you guys should have at least one visit together so you can see for yourself what is happening. Dementia patients can change so fast, there's no way to know that she won't recognize them next time. \n\nWhen I worked in a memory care unit, if a resident was upset, sometimes you could leave the room, change your hairstyle and walk back in and they'd be completely fine. There are a lot of options like this that should have been tried first.", "Wow, I can\u2019t imagine not being allowed to see my own mom. Surely you must see how unfair this is to your brother? Give him the chance to work out a way to calm her down on his own. It may take some time but he should he allowed to see her.", "NTA  but your brother is NTA either. \n\nAs a geriatric RN that specializes in dementia patients this is still a mother/son relationship and should continue. He could go during a meal time and sit with her while she eats. She could be in a common area when he visits. I have had patients where there religions were very important to them in the past (I'm not religious) and when their was a religious function in their faith I would take them to it even when they would say that they weren't interested. I did this because prior to cognitive impairment people would tell me that they never want to give up their religion. They would also tell me that the most important thing to them is their relationship with their children. \n\nHere are a few pointers for dementia patients: Always  sit with them at eye level - they have tunnel vision (like looking through a toilet paper roll) and if you stand they will see your abdomen area. Never say \"Don't you remember.... or \"I just told you that\" Short term memory is first to go and they don't remember what you just told them. Never argue a fact with them, their reality is much different. Talk about the past. She does not remember your brother because she might be in a time period where he is 10 years old and the man standing in front of her is not.\n\nTalk in slow and simple sentences, move slow - tasks that you to take seconds now can take 5 minutes. Only give one step instructions like here is something to drink - I am handing you the cup - hold the cup - take a sip - I will take it from you - I am placing on table. You are then telling her what to do one step at a time and also telling her what you are doing. \n\nDementia is very scary for those that have it and they are scared all the time, but they do not deserve to be isolated from loved one. \n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of bitterness towards your brother but you need to remove this from the conversation. You don't trust him because of when he was younger but he has a job that has awful hours and he has a family.  Your mother and brother deserve 1:1 time together without supervision - he or she have not committed a crime. There are interventions to make it work. Also outburst may happen, but the staff are looking for ways to make their job easier instead of taking the time to make it work.", "YTA, you shouldn\u2019t even have to ask.", "I think you should speak with your mom's care team and see what they suggest. My concern is if your brother sponged off your mom into his 30's, is he trying to get her to sign checks or some sort of financial abuse? That is a very real concern and he wouldn't be the first family member to swindle a loved one.", "YTA. It's people like you that I can't stand. I worked in a nursing home before I had my youngest daughter and plan to return when she starts school in the fall. A woman was doing the same thing that you are. It got to the point where her sister fought her for power of attorney over their dad, she was the same woman that would never visit her dad. That poor man only had one month after the sister won before he passed. You are hurting your family and when your mother passes away your family will resent you.", "I think everyone gets yours situation but you are really isolating her and robbing everyone of these moments. Your solution was good but as it isn't ideal, actually like being chaperoned, which they do need but it doesn't have. To always be you. There are staff there that can mediate the visits. Every visit can be different. She may not remember them to day but recognize them tomorrow. The most important thing is for them to acknowledge the point when to leave when here behavior becomes erratic cause she doesn't recognize them , voicing she feels unsafe etc. That when they know that can't force that visit and need to leave. It heart breaking but they have to know which battles to choose.", "YTA and how the fuck if he doesn\u2019t recognize them is the same not happening with you?

If the decline had reached that point I can't fault someone for making the choices that will cause the least stress for the patient.", "I recall my mom and I had to put in an extremely strong recommendation that my cousins not being the great grands to visit Mawmaw. They thought we were mean and brought them anyways, I get there that afternoon and the she was panicking the someone has kidnapped her kids.

Other options  before that include: actually programming the visitations so she learns to anticipe that, bring photos, choosing a neutral place other than her room, being with you while they visit.

Having had a grandmother and a great grandmother who went into residential homes for dementia patients, it's actually HORRIBLE to cut them off.  Even if they no longer recognize someone.\n\nIn the home my grandmother was in, they even had two patients per room.  The buddy system actually helped my grandmother stay more in the present most of the time.  The one my great grandmother was in had multiple visiting rooms, expansive common areas indoor and out, as well as private rooms.  They did not allow the residents to just sit behind closed doors all day.  They had activities and outings and encouraged all the visitors a person could get.\n\nBoth of these women actually enjoyed their stays, because simply by being older and at the mercy of their failing memories, they were being isolated in their homes.

I know what you\u2019re going through. I live 23 hours away from my grandma. When I call her, she thinks I\u2019m my sister, since my sister lives 10 minutes away and is able to visit often. \n\nI totally get the discomfort in letting your mom feel uncomfortable with a \u201cstranger\u201d in her room. But not allowing her to have visitors won\u2019t help her improve or stabilize, and isolating her from opportunity to remember is actively damaging her. My grandma has moments of lucidity where she does remember, because we jog her memory. It\u2019ll take a minute, but if we explain to her and then let her think she\u2019ll usually be able to figure it out, and if she can\u2019t, we drop it so she doesn\u2019t get upset that she can\u2019t remember, or worse, accuse us of lying to her. \n\nMaybe a caveat for nursing staff to \u201cplease ask them to leave if she\u2019s having a bad memory day and gets distressed\u201d and an explanation of that to your brother would be a better idea, talk to him so that he can try to understand that he shouldn\u2019t distress her for his own sake, and there\u2019s an inherent risk of that with her condition. If he wants to visit and she doesn\u2019t remember him, have a nurse ask if she would like to come to a common area and play a familiar game (checkers, go fish, whatever- anything easy for an elder with weak memory and that would be ingrained in her past with her kids/grandkids) and maybe she\u2019ll be less tense if her interaction with a \u201cstranger\u201d is framed as \u201cplaying checkers with a nice young man and his kids in the dining room that just want to play some games with you for a bit\u201d instead of \u201crandom strangers have been allowed into my room without my consent.\u201d If she\u2019s anything like my grandma and doesn\u2019t want to be in common areas, ask a nurse to make sure to go in and explain who is visiting and if she\u2019s comfortable before letting them in. \n\nAlso going to familiar places helps my grandma a lot. When I visit we always take her to places we went to as a family years ago or bring her food she remembers and asks nursing staff for or tells them about often. You\u2019d be surprised how much taste and smell help out some people, sense memory is a thing. \n\nMy mom also keeps updated photos on grandmas wall with all of her kids, grandkids, and great grandkids, plus family like her husband and brother in law so she doesn\u2019t forget about them or forget that they\u2019ve passed, even the family dogs are on there, all labeled with names and their relation to her in letters big enough for her to see. Some of them, like mine, also have where they live so on relatively good days she can understand why they haven\u2019t visited in a while. So next to my picture would be \u201cOHMNI- MARY\u2019S GRANDDAUGHTER IN MONTANA\u201d. That way if she forgets someone when we\u2019re talking about them we can point at a photo, and she sees their photo every day with a refresher on who they are, so she forgets less often. And the nurses can point to the photo to reinforce that memory if she ever mentions or asks about anyone. Unless she\u2019s on the phone and then it\u2019s hit or miss, but you do what you can. She has a big daily calendar with birthdays, anniversaries, and pictures of whoever\u2019s special day it is and how they\u2019re related to her, how old they\u2019ll be, how long a couple has been married, or how long they\u2019ve been gone. It\u2019s helped her out. Maybe something you could try with your mom to help reconnect her to some of her memories.\n\nWe also went through this with her husband, my grandpa. He had brain cancer that manifested similarly to Alzheimer\u2019s and was misdiagnosed. He came in and out, didn\u2019t remember us, told us we had to leave because his wife would be home soon while she was sitting at the table playing cards with all of us, and him. Even on his death bed he was coming in and out of recalling past memories, even pointed out shadows that with his poor eyesight, he thought it was a kid running around and told my mom it reminded him of a time when I was playing at his house.\n\nYou take risks on the bad days in case it\u2019ll be a good day instead.

I had to start calling my grandma by her first name instead of grandma. She enjoyed the company (in common areas) and didn\u2019t get upset if she didn\u2019t understand why I called her grandma. I got to see her, and she still had social time with her family.", "YTA. From what I remember from both my grandfathers with dementia, memories would come and go. Sometimes he\u2019d recognize us grandkids, other times he\u2019d only recognize his own kids. I understand your motivation is to protect your mother but you took too drastic a step and it seems like your feelings toward your brother may be coloring your judgment here.", "You can make a poster for her room with family faces and names, maybe a little book for her to carry around.

Allow me ti explain. Op you need to realize that you\u2019ve completely cut off every family member from visiting your mother without any type of conversation before hand. You selfishly made that decision for everyone and your bother had to find out one of two ways. Either the facility called and Informed them or they went up there to see her and got denied. The way you handled it was not the right way. You had the right intentions but it was the wrong execution. Now what your family ALSO must understand is that while they remember her and know who she is she has no idea who they are and it can be very scary for her. In her mind she\u2019s confused, she doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening and now she has someone who she believes is a Stranger in her room. I\u2019m a STNA in a nursing home and I\u2019ve had to watch our nurses escort family members out of rooms because the resident was so upset and agitated. Sometimes they sadly cannot remember their family. In this situation I feel like the best solution for you and your family OP would be to start the IPad calls and go from there. One thing I know really helps is bringing in a \u201cmemory book\u201d or what it is more commonly know as a scrap book. Fill it with pictures of your child hood, your family, any trips you\u2019ve taken, fill it with pictures of your moms childhood if you have them. At the end of the day Alzheimer is a horrible disease that sadly doesn\u2019t have a cure for it. You and your family need to come together and figure this out before it\u2019s too late. I sincerely hope you see this comment and that it helps. I\u2019ve seen both sides and what it can do to the family and the resident and it\u2019s a hard battle. I wish you guys luck and hope you and your brother/family can figure out how to manage this situation.", "yta, every one else already told you why, it still amazes me that you think what she wanted was to have contact with her own family cut off, she should have left your brother in charge.", "INFO: Are there no communal areas in the facility? Does your brother and family HAVE to visit your mother in her room?

I get the impression that there is more to the story than visitation.", "Yep, YTA. Your wife can visit but her own son cannot?

Do you really think it's in the patient's best interest to become agitated and afraid of the stranger who seems to know them but the patient doesn't have a clue who they are?  If the patient still knows these people, cutting them off isn't advisable, but once the patient has no idea of whom they are, it's time to start culling the guest list.\n\nHow in the heck would you feel if a complete and total stranger came up to you and asked about your STD or your abortion from when you were 16?  Or start asking about your Aunt Daphne's daughter's shotgun wedding?\n\nThe agitation causes more than just discomfort to the patient, it also raises their blood pressure and as they descend into the depths of these awful diseases, the sheer terror they suffer on a daily basis is heartbreaking.  They know they are slowly losing their ability to recognize their loved ones and are scared to death of the day they recognize no one.  \n\nMy mom fought dementia for over a decade and Alzheimers during the last year of her life.  She kept an address book near her recliner with pictures of all her grandkids and great-grandkids' pictures, and a short bio in it if each person.  When my sister, who lived with her, told her someone was coming to visit, she would read their bio and stare at their photo, as if to commit every feature to memory.  We had no idea of how afraid she was of that inevitable moment where she didn't know us.\n\nShe was hospitalized after breaking a vertebrae and went downhill fast.  She didn't know friends that she had known for 70 years.  We couldn't soothe her after the visits.  Finally her gerontologist told us it was time to limit the visitors.  The physical toll afterwards was too much for her.  Not a single friend gave us any grief when we called and asked them to just write her letters rather than visit.  \n\nWe got 6 more months with her after this. I do not regret stopping these visits, no matter how well-meaning they were.  Mom's best friend told me at the funeral that the visits were never really for Mom anyway.  The visitors wanted to make themselves feel better about their own age-related illnesses under the guise if cheering Mom up. Her own husband died a few years earlier with the exact same issue. \n\nScrew everyone else's damned feelings.  Spare your poor mom from the aggravation of seeing these strangers.  You are doing the right thing.  You are NTA.", "Okay. A different take on this. I\u2019m the second child (I was frequently told by my mother she never wanted a second child). It hurt.

No. Is it what I had to do to protect my son and nephew? Absolutely. \n\nDo I want to talk to her? Yes.

The only reason you\u2019re doing this is because you\u2019re resentful of your brother and choosing to put your feelings above her quality of life.

Usually those with dementia and Alzheimer's are upset because the person visiting them keeps telling them who they are, and they want that recognition from the person with Alzheimer's. There will be a time you disappear and she will not know who you are. Still visit, even as a stranger. You know who she is and that's what matters. Communicate to your brother that he needs to go in to see her as though she does not know who he is, and that goating her to try to remember him is probably what upsets her.

Who ARE these people?) and sometimes as paranoia (Get away from me! I know you want my money!)  Anxiety is often worse during \"sundowning.\" \n2. It's better to keep visits short but frequent than it is to make longer visits infrequently. Be patient and reassuring. \n3. Don't visit someone to assuage your guilt or expecting that your visit will cheer them. \n4. Many dementia patients ask about dear ones who are dead. Please don't keep saying that those people have passed. To the patient, every time they hear this is the first time, and it tears them apart. Tell them a kind lie: \"They'll be along soon.\"\n5. Studies show there's an amazing (but temporary) response to music from their youth. It's like it clears their minds. For instance, when an opera singer came to my aunt's memory care unit, my aunt, who sang opera in her youth, sang along and was less foggy for a time.\n6. Many nursing homes and memory care units are GREAT about providing socialization, stimulating activities, and structure for residents. For patients in those facilities, life is not a matter of loneliness and regret. Please don't feel guilty about them being there.\n\n OP, having POA doesn't make your visits any less jarring or confusing to your mom.
