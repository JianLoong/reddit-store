It seems that MIL isn\u2019t fully fluent in English and maybe she just wants to talk to her own daughter in a language she\u2019s comfortable in.", "Not learning a second language is not an AH move though. Many Americans only use English in their day-to-day lives\n\nThe way OP is going about this makes him an AH.", "Because it's harder than *you* think to be forced to have a conversation in a foreign language with someone you usually speak your mother tongue with. It feels very unnatural and takes a fair bit of effort.\n\nWhy not flip it around and ask yourself why you can't be bothered to learn some French?", "Then learn french", "This comment right here is what turns you from NAH to YTA.    \n\n\nHOw about you make the effort to learn French?   Fifteen minutes a day on Duolingo and within a few months you wouldn't be fluent or anything but you'd certainly know enough to get the jist of important remarks.    And you have the opportunity to practice with a native french speaker!", "You\u2019re right. \n\nYou\u2019re turning your back on your wife\u2019s family by not learning French. You are very rude and you should stop.", "I mean, should they make a big deal out of your inability to speak French? I mean from your post it doesn\u2019t sound like you are very well in English either.\n\nYTA, for your entitled attitude.", "A lot of my friends are bilingual Afrikaans-English speakers. I am a native English speaker. \n\nWhen we hang out, they go back and forth, because that's just how they communicate. \n\nMy crazy solution was: learn Afrikaans. \n\nSome goals, in order: \n\n1) enough to say \"Please speak english\" \n2) speak and understand just well enough that nobody thinks they can get away with talking about me in front of me\n3) actual proficiency.", "Seriously, your kids speak it, your in laws speak it. It's worth putting in the effort to learn it. Duolingo is free. 5-10 min a day you can start picking up the basics.  Rosetta Stone is pretty effective too. I started learning French two months ago, I don't spend more then 30 min a day but it's a start.  \n\nYou are putting the onus on everyone else to accommodate you instead of offering any effort yourself.  Your MIL might not feel she can fully express herself in a English yet so she diverts to something that is easier for her.  It's not about excluding you.", "No, you\u2018re not being an asshole for leaving the conversation. If you don\u2019t understand it makes sense that you would leave and do something else. Like when I go to my husbands hometown in China his family can\u2019t speak English at all and only a little bit of Mandarin which I can speak. They will speak to me in Mandarin for a few  minutes but then go back to speaking Cantonese because that\u2019s more natural for them. I would always take a book to read because they would sit and drink tea and chat for hours sometimes. They never seemed annoyed at all about it and I even asked my husband and he said they won\u2019t consider it rude, they would like me to do what makes me comfortable in their home.", "You do have time to learn you simply chose not to. I\u2019ve been using Duolingo in French for a few years now (lessons are 5-15 minutes per day) and my French is through the roof. If I ALSO had people at home I could talk to it would be amazing!! You are missing out.", "Just communicate better with your wife.  Let her know you sometimes want them to speak English so you can share in the convo, but that you understand it\u2019s often easier for her mom to speak to her in French esp if it\u2019s a topic that doesn\u2019t involve you.  Doubt you want them to talk about hairstyles in English around you just for your sake.", "If the kids are learning it that sounds like the perfect opportunity for you to learn as well. Learn from them when you talk to them and you\u2019ll be encouraging their bilingual skills, which could set them up for a better future", "Exactly, they don\u2019t do it on purpose to exclude you, it\u2019s just the language that \u201cpops out\u201d when they see each other. If your wife is fluent in both languages she most likely doesn\u2019t even realise she\u2019s speaking French, she\u2019s just speaking. I speak  3 languages fluently, at a native level, sometimes I\u2019ve been with 2 different people whom I\u2019ve always spoken different languages with, and it takes a LOT of conscious effort not to switch to my default language with either of them just so the other can join in. So NAH. It\u2019s not an AH move since they have no real conscious choice on it", "I work 10 hours a day and have 3 kids.", "If I was in a foreign speaking country or home I understand more but my own home and everyone can speak English, I dunno. I am kinda drunk though\ud83d\ude09", "If you've been married long enough to have 3 kids and haven't made an effort to learn French, that's on you.", "Better start picking up duolingo then, or in a few years you're going to feel REALLY excluded when your kids speak French and you don't understand them and their conversations with French relatives or their mom.\n\nBut serious advice, duolingo IS really convenient, makes learning easy even with 15 minutes in a day.", "And yet you have time to complain on reddit but not do an occasional French exercise on duolingo...", "They weren\u2019t talking to you though. You weren\u2019t a part of the conversation.", "You can spare 10 mins a day on duolingo to pick up French. It\u2019s a common enough language that there are plenty of resources out there.", "Wahhhhhhhhhhh what a cry baby lmao", "My brother-in-law was French and I picked up enough of the language on occasional visits to their house that I was able to follow along with much of the conversation when his family came to visit. I couldn\u2019t speak it much but I would ask for clarification in English and they would elaborate. If you made ANY effort at all you could do the same.\n\nIf you were to do any research on languages you would know that people in relationships find it difficult to switch to a different language when speaking to each other. Especially a parent and child.", "Hoy long have You been married?", "Ya you got some issues bub - you need to work on that.", "IM THE KING OF MUH CASTLE lmao get over yourself. It's their home too, and they out number you so it SEEMS like maybe you're living in a French home bud.", "You chose to marry a French speaking woman with French speaking family. You cannot do the \"In my home in an English speaking country we speak English!\" When you married and had children with a French speaking person.", "I\u2019m learning Italian because I\u2019m going on vacation there and I think it\u2019s rude to expect everyone to know English. You can\u2019t learn French for the woman you\u2019re going to spend your life with? Duolingo, learn French. Speak Frenglish at home. Accommodate your MIL and stop feeling excluded."]}
