The parking lot is directly outside our back door. There is a sidewalk that goes down the rest of the building with some grassy area behind it.\n\n**The Situation:**\n\nAbout 2-3 months ago, some drifter started showing up and hanging out with an elderly guy on the other end unit. I always suspected some minor drug use, or at the very least a pain pill addiction from the elderly gentleman (very slow moving, several conversations about our medical marijuana cards, etc).\n\nLong story short, this drifter guy ends up moving in with the elderly guy, moves his car over here into our parking lot and everything. This was no big deal. He did some really weird shit, like taped our parking blocks together with duct tape, raked the parking lot, etc, just typical meth/opiate addict stuff, no big deal. He was weird, but always nice and respectful.\n\nFast forward to about a week ago. Home boy was spending an awful lot of time in the parking lot. There was now a suitcase out there, all of his clothes, the grill, and a cot. I let my dogs out around midnight and sure enough, they ran over by his car and started barking, he was sleeping. It was a cool night so I figured maybe he was just enjoying the night. Well, this went on for a few days and I started to assume that they had got into an argument as the arrangement seemed drug related to begin with. I hoped if I gave it a little time he'd move on or back in with the elderly guy. Now, he's been there a little over a week, with no signs of leaving. This morning he showed up with a box full of groceries on his shoulder and put them all in his car.\n\nI'm really not sure what to do. I don't want to call the cops and I don't want to call the landlord, because they will just call the cops. I do feel bad, because I get it. I struggled for 10+ years with alcohol addiction and homelessness.\n\nAt the same time, it's extremely uncomfortable to walk out my back door. I don't feel like grilling out there anymore. He's using grass and leaves to cook food on the grill and it smells like shit. My dogs are constantly eating or bringing inside some piece of burnt bread or food he throws all over the parking lot. I definitely don't want family pulling up to visit. It's just like, he's stayed his welcome and it's time to go now.\n\nMy plan is to put a letter from Chat GPT that states intent to tow on his car from the property management company. I have fake letterhead and the letter is written.\n\n**TLDR:** Homeless junkie moved into the end unit duplex, got kicked out, now he lives right outside my back door, in his car, in the parking lot. Don't want to get him in trouble with cops/confrontation, can't call landlord because they would call cops. Debating on whether or not I should put a fake letter Chat GPT wrote that says his car will be towed from the property company to get him out of here.

I would go ahead and call the landlord.", "YTA  If you're not assertive enough to tell him that he can't live there then you involve someone who is, rather than pretending to be someone who you are not.  The cops aren't going to incarcerate him so why does it matter who makes him leave and why are you going to somehow feel less bad about making him leave as long as the cops aren't the ones who do it?  It makes no sense.", "NTA but you should just call the landlord or cops - they\u2019re just going to tell him he has to move his car. He\u2019s trespassing (assuming it\u2019s a private parking for residents only). He\u2019s not going to get arrested or anything unless he refuses to leave.", "YWBTA to write a fake letter. You would also be a liar. Handle this legitimately. Call the landlord. You are not helping this guy by lying and having him do the same thing somewhere else. Why not talk to him about getting some help? Don\u2019t be an AH and a coward and make stuff up", "Would not be the AH but might not be the best way possible. How many units use that parking lot?", "NTA, and yeah he's living in his car right outside your home. thing about it is though if you do that on your own with the letter and he doesn't leave then you'll have to contact the landlord anyway. If you didn't clear it with the landlord ahead of time then you've got another problem. Hope it works out for you.", "NTH - you've mentioned that you've struggled with similar issues in the past and you specifically don't want to call the cops. However, what if the letter doesn't work? You'd have to call the cops at some point I assume.", "Man OP, the language you're using to describe a human being is so depressing. Especially as a person who was previously homeless?\n\nTalk to the damn guy, tell him you don't like this behaviour, how is he supposed to change if you don't ask him to? If he's nice to you, you gotta tell him how you feel.\n\nThe man has nowhere to go, he is going to be *visible* with his trauma and addiction. Talk to him about what to do moving forward, I can guarantee you he will be receptive to you if the alternative is calling the cops. YWBTA, *if* you write that letter.\n\nYour approach is probably criminal. Maybe you can write a letter instead about what you're concerned about, like the drug use?\n\nSource; Work at a homeless shelter", "YWBTA, but only because using the property management company's letterhead would be fraud, and that could seriously come back and bite you hard. You may not like the option of letting the landlord or police know, but that's your only legal option other than just ignoring it. The cops may just ask him to move along, but you will never know unless you try.", "YWBTA.\n\nJust let the landlord handle it. If cops are called, it's not your problem.", "You're in a tough position and it really sounds like you're approaching it with more empathy than most people would. Personally I cannot think of another solution aside from calling the cops and potentially making his situation even worse, but I think a fake letter would be a good way to let him know he's outstayed his welcome. NTA.", "I don\u2019t want to call you an AH because you clearly aren\u2019t, but this isn\u2019t the way to go. Please just go talk to the guy. He\u2019s a human and it sounds like you can empathize with him more than most people. He hasn\u2019t done anything aggressive. He\u2019s just existing in a way that is really inconvenient for you.

The cops don't help anyone in that situation, they only exist to make things worse for people struggling with the things he is struggling with.\n\nThere are a lot of people that would have called the cops when he started taping parking blocks together, he isn't a resident.

It's not like eviction notices or unpaid rent notices are being forged.", "The bottom line is, OP can't have it both ways.  Either he's the guy who makes him leave or he's the guy who lets him stay.
