In fact, this is such an important distinction (between you being kids and not yet adults who are ready to make these decisions for yourselves - or each other) that it is codified in the law in most countries, to make sure that you don't have to worry about such things. \n\nI'm old enough to be your parent (and probably even your grandparent, honestly), and I'm telling you this as someone who genuinely cares about kids (I have worked with kids my whole life):\n\nI'm not going to say that your girlfriend is \"jealous\" or whatever. Maybe she is, but I don't know her, and I don't want to be hateful because I know she's someone you care about. Nothing I say here is meant to tear down this girl you love. So keep that in mind when I say this . . .\n\nDespite that, *it's none of her business what the adults in your life choose to buy for you*, especially the adults who are in charge of taking care of you. She doesn't get to make those decisions. It doesn't matter how she feels about it, or what her own family situation is. Your family has nothing to do with hers. And she is not your parent, or in charge of you, and she doesn't get to make decisions about what you get to have or not have - especially if her reasoning is that you can't have things just because she doesn't. That is not how loving, supportive partners behave. When you love someone, you want to lift them up and celebrate the good things that happen to them . . . not punish them or hold them back for it.\n\nMore importantly, and related to that, she is being worryingly controlling. \n\nShe doesn't have a right to get mad about this, because your relationship with your parents and what they do or don't buy you isn't hers to get mad about. And if it upsets her that your parents buy you things that hers can't, then she should see a counselor to learn to deal with her envy and her overwhelming emotions. Her feelings are normal and understandable, but *she has no right to take them out on you, or make you feel responsible for them or as though you've done something wrong.* ***You have done nothing wrong, and there is nothing here for you to compromise about***. In fact, \"compromising\" would be the worst thing you can do, because it would suggest that she has a right to have input on your relationship with your parents, which she does not. \n\nYou are NTA, but I'm genuinely concerned that she is making you feel like you have to appease her. Her anger is unfounded and inappropriately directed at you. You don't owe her apologies or compromises, my friend. She owes YOU an apology.", "It's ironic that your girlfriend is calling you spoiled because she has a bizarre sense of entitlement and control over you. You probably shouldn't be dating her because she is abusive.", "NTA. You need a phone and your parents want to provide it. Your gf is jealous because you get things she doesn't.

Jealousy is an ugly trait.", "NTA, your girlfriend has absolutely no say in what your parents buy you. You are still technically a child. Your parents can \"spoil\" you if they want to.

However, just like the screaming toddler will need to learn emotional regulation, your GF needs to learn to accept that the world is unfair. Take the new phone.", "A healthy relationship does not involve giving up opportunities just because your partner doesn't have the same. She should WANT you to have nice things. \n\nShe is jealous and selfish. If you give in to this, how will she behave if you get to go to Hawaii on vacation in the summer? Are you going to give thar up too?\n\nThe more you give up for her, the more you will resent her for it later (like when your phone does break). When you give up a piece of yourself or your world to .ake someone else happy, you end up unhappy. You should not have to give up opportunities from your family just because hers can't provide the same. \n\nYou are much better off telling her you need a new phone, and at 16, it is your parents that should and will buy it for you. Tell her you are sad that she can't be happy for you. But you still need a phone regardless of her feelings. You prefer an iPhone, your parents agreed to it, so it is happening.  \n\nYou need to learn early where to compromise in a relationship. If you don't,  you will change into someone you are not happy with. Happiness in a relationship does not come from who you are with as much as it comes from how they treat you. \n\nIf you change your wants and needs to suit your partner,  your wants and needs are not met, and you will not be happy in the long term.  \n\nWorst case, she dumps you. I doubt it would go that far. If it does, she didn't like you much in the first place. That or she wants to know (subconsciously) that she is the most important thing in your life. If she is that insecure, it will only get worse with time.\n\nYwnbta for asking your parents to get you something you want and need for your birthday!\n\nNow read that line again, and see how silly it is?

It is OK to stay in a toxic relationship damaging yourself so you give the other person an opportunity?
