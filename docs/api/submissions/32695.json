I'm 35, living alone, working late and on weekends to support my bussiness, I don't have TV, don't listen to the music at night, my friends and family who visit are civil, our favourite entertainment together is to sit at the table and talk, I clean common space and keep the outside of the building tidy as all the other neighbors. I never caused any trouble.\n\nAlmost two months ago my 40 y.o. neighbor informed me that someone is watching the house on the weekends and trying to break in. I never saw or heared anything but mentioned that it is the right opportunity for us to start locking the entrance door (we have common door without any lock). Him and his parents refused to agree saying that nothing will hold back the burglars. I've asked other neighbors (there are several apartment blocks next to ours) if they have the similar problem, nobody confirmed it, they were even shocked that something like that is happening because our neigborhood is considered very safe and always have been. That alarmed me and made me think the whole situation is very weird and unbelievable. \n\nOver past weeks the situation escalated. The neighboring family called the police after the son claimed hearing somebody breaking in at night. Again, nor I or lady living upstairs noticed anything. Right after this happening, the family started to barricade the entrance door from the inside not only at night but also during the day. That resulted in me not being able to enter my own house, not once but twice and later even my family couldn't come inside because the plank was barricading the door handle. \n\nThat made me furious. They refused to see their own fault in this, blaming me for being angry at them and belittling the problem but there were still saying no to the lock. Not being able to talk reasonably with them, suspecting the problem with the burglars might be a paranoia or personal agenda of the 40 y,o, guy and people trying to scare him (I suspect he has unfinished shady bussiness with someone), I went to the building administration for help. I asked beforehand my upstairs neighbor if she agrees to the lock, she said yes, so did the admin. \n\nNext day building manager visted to tell us that the lock will be installed on the door, asked what's going on and all hell broke loose. The couple living next to me called me a b\\*\\*\\*h, know it all and a snitch. \n\nAITA for telling the building administration about the problem? I couldn't resolve it peacefully with my neighbors, feeling unsafe in my own house not only because supposed threaths about the burglars   but also because I didn't know if I was able to enter the building each time I left. I couldn't let these people act as they owned the building and trying to regulate our lives anymore.

I would have done that.", "My words exactly. They laughed it off.", "We live in a community building and whenever there is an issue it's expected of all the neighbors to agree. The thing with a lock was raised by my mother few years ago for the first time, said naighbors refused back then also and the case was dropped. Untill now. My mother passed away, I live in this apartment now and I cannot let people terrorize me.", "Thank you, I'm trying to be.", "They have issues and are not considerate neighbours - you did the right thing reporting to building management. This could have caused a serious issue. \n\nMy housemate gets scared after dark and will deadbolt the door - however, given that it now gets dark at 5pm, this means it\u2019s often bolted before I get home from work. A couple of times this has resulted in me hammering on the door, because my housemate has gone and put headphones on and can\u2019t hear me trying to get in. I\u2019m lucky that this only had to happen a couple of times for her to realise she couldn\u2019t keep it up, and now she waits until I\u2019m home. That\u2019s what the correct response would have been in this situation.", "The neighbors are obviously the issue here. I hope that you let your landlord know if they continue to harass you \u2014 hopefully they don\u2019t renew their lease", "I wish it was like that in my case. Unfortunately there is no way for me to talk to them, they act as if I am the crazy one for not supporting the idea of barring the door. I have no remorse anymore.", "Just a thought, aren't there app controlled deadbolts you could use instead to prevent that? Might be a good fix", "This is not OPs problem to handle. If anything happens, report it to management again, let them take care of it. Management would always rather lose a disruptive tenant than a reasonable one.", "You don\u2019t need to have remorse for wanting access to your house. They need to find another solution for their security concerns and that should be done through the landlord, not by taking action on their own", "That would be the best option really but I'm afraid not all the neighbors are able to use this kind of device.", "Something I\u2019ll probs look into in the new year! My housemate is an actor but she hasn\u2019t found any work in a year, and I\u2019ve been through two redundancy processes this year so we haven\u2019t been making many upgrades to the house, but we have a bit more financial stability to start spending on things like this now.", "NTA. What these neighbors are doing is causing an inconvenience to your entry and egress from your home that you do not have to tolerate. Being block inside or outside your home is also a possible fire hazard, so these neighbors could be breaking fire codes.\n\nAnd what's all this \"snitching\" business? Does that mean we are supposed to see no evil, hear no evil, and speak no evil when we KNOW wrong is being done?\n\nSounds like anarchy to me.\n\nStick up for yourself. You have every right to do so. Remember, evil wins when good people do nothing.", "Could you explain why you thought you might be the asshole in this situation? Because it's not even debatable.

You should also report them to the building administration for harassment", "NTA.  Them blocking the door is also a safety hazard.  It prevents people from getting out in an emergency.  It prevents emergency personnel from getting in.  \n\nParanoia is common with people that use meth.  They will think people are following them.  They will even think the government is watching them.  I know several people where this has occurred with them, including my roommate.  It has also caused them to lose their jobs.  An unemployed 40 y/o living with his parents is probably on drugs.", "Is it possible they have a CO leak in their place? Would explain the odd behaviour.", "Absolutely NTA. When your neighbours start barricading you out of your own building, non-negotiable measures are needed. It is very strange that they didn't want a lock put on the door, but you have done nothing wrong. I hope if they need help of the MH or other variety, they get it!", "NTA. It is a safety hazard. I'd be looking for a new place if I were you. Bad neighbors can be a bad problem. Some people are just inconsiderate. They are oblivious to how their actions affect others or simply don't care. You did the right thing. It's your home too.", "NTA that's shitty and irrational behavior from your neighbor. Expect mentally unwell behavior in the future.", "If they barricade the door, call the fire department", "You want that barrier down in a hurry?  Call the fire department.

Once your new lock is installed, go to the store and buy another one the same brand and replace it. You don\u2019t want someone else having a key \ud83d\udd11 to your place. Unless it\u2019s in the lease. Maybe get a camera for the inside of your place. Your neighbors seem creepy.", "If the parents know they have any hearing loss (ie the tv volume turned up) and otherwise trust the son, they will readily believe he heard something they didn\u2019t", "Moreover, why not barricade just their own damn apartment and not the communal entryway if they're so damn scared?", "Honestly, stop talking to them about it. They aren't going to see reason and you can't convince them. Just keep talking to building management.", "I truly can\u2019t understand how they are opposed to a lock but ok with barring the door. \nWhat??", "Sounds like a mental illness with components of paranoia and parents are buying into it based on the post but there could be something else like proposed", "can you install a ring camera or something similar available in your area?\n\nNTA and easy to solve if building maintenance will allow some kind of security system that records video of comings and goings."]}
