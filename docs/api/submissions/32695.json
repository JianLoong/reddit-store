I'm 35, living alone, working late and on weekends to support my bussiness, I don't have TV, don't listen to the music at night, my friends and family who visit are civil, our favourite entertainment together is to sit at the table and talk, I clean common space and keep the outside of the building tidy as all the other neighbors. I never caused any trouble.\n\nAlmost two months ago my 40 y.o. neighbor informed me that someone is watching the house on the weekends and trying to break in. I never saw or heared anything but mentioned that it is the right opportunity for us to start locking the entrance door (we have common door without any lock). Him and his parents refused to agree saying that nothing will hold back the burglars. I've asked other neighbors (there are several apartment blocks next to ours) if they have the similar problem, nobody confirmed it, they were even shocked that something like that is happening because our neigborhood is considered very safe and always have been. That alarmed me and made me think the whole situation is very weird and unbelievable. \n\nOver past weeks the situation escalated. The neighboring family called the police after the son claimed hearing somebody breaking in at night. Again, nor I or lady living upstairs noticed anything. Right after this happening, the family started to barricade the entrance door from the inside not only at night but also during the day. That resulted in me not being able to enter my own house, not once but twice and later even my family couldn't come inside because the plank was barricading the door handle. \n\nThat made me furious. They refused to see their own fault in this, blaming me for being angry at them and belittling the problem but there were still saying no to the lock. Not being able to talk reasonably with them, suspecting the problem with the burglars might be a paranoia or personal agenda of the 40 y,o, guy and people trying to scare him (I suspect he has unfinished shady bussiness with someone), I went to the building administration for help. I asked beforehand my upstairs neighbor if she agrees to the lock, she said yes, so did the admin. \n\nNext day building manager visted to tell us that the lock will be installed on the door, asked what's going on and all hell broke loose. The couple living next to me called me a b\\*\\*\\*h, know it all and a snitch. \n\nAITA for telling the building administration about the problem? I couldn't resolve it peacefully with my neighbors, feeling unsafe in my own house not only because supposed threaths about the burglars   but also because I didn't know if I was able to enter the building each time I left. I couldn't let these people act as they owned the building and trying to regulate our lives anymore.
