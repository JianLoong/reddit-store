{"id": 209, "submission_id": "yimn4g", "title": "AITA for catching the bouquet at a wedding instead of a little kid?", "selftext": "I was a bridesmaid at my childhood friend's wedding last weekend, there weren't many other single ladies there at the wedding so when it came time for the flower toss it was me and like, 4 other women. And the other women weren't really into it, I could hear comments like \"lets get this over with\" So when the bouquet came in my vicinity, I reached out and caught it. I did have to kinda swing my arm out a little to grab it, it wasn't like it came right to me, but I didn't think anyone else was gonna catch it and didn't want my friend (the bride) to feel bad or something.\n\nWhat I didn't notice though, was the bride's young niece decided to join in (and by young I mean like, under 10 years old. Maybe 7 or 8?). Bc she was small and about a step behind me, I just didn't see her. I accidentally just snatched it in front of the poor girl. I did accidentally elbow her slightly when I reached out for it, not hard and I didn't knock her over or anything, but I definitely made contact with her shoulder/chest area.\n\nWhen all was said and done I felt bad, so I apologized for accidentally pushing her and offered her the bouquet, but she shook her head and ran off. Her dad (Bride's brother, who knows me personally) told me it was no big deal and to forget about it, but I think her mom was kinda miffed at me too. Idk, I could have just been reading too much into it, she never said anything to me but I just didn't like the look she gave me I guess. The bride thought it was funny, so at least I didn't step on any toes there. Last thing I wanted was to make the bride feel anything negative on her day lol. The kid kinda withdrew from the party after that though. Just kind hung around her mom at the tables.\n\nI typically am the type to put kids first, I think their enjoyment should come before my own bc childhood is so fleeting (and I'll be real, I myself didn't actually care about the bouquet. I only caught it bc I was afraid it would just hit the damn floor if I didn't, given the other adult participants lack of enthusiasm). I just genuinely didn't know the kid was there until it was too late.\n\nDid I do all I could to make it right by just offering up the bouquet afterwards? Or you think I could have done something else? Maybe ask the bride if she wanted to do a re-toss or something to let her have it? Idk. I'm young and haven't been to many weddings, and this was the first \"formal\" wedding I'd ever been a part of. I just feel kinda silly about it and want to know if there was really anything else I could have done or if I'm just being overly conscious about it.", "created_utc": 1667245437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yimn4g/aita_for_catching_the_bouquet_at_a_wedding/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the nature of the flower toss.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCatching of the boquet is not a child activity. She was fine to join, but you did nothing wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are fie. Nothing bad happened.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUt you might wish to ask the bride if she wants to have it as a memento.", "I doubt this will be a core memory for the kid. It\u2019s not a big deal.

In my family that would be a story told and embellished for decades. Lol, accidents happen. NAH.", "NTA. It was an accident as you didn\u2019t see her and you gave her the flowers once you realised. Asking the bride to redo the toss just makes a bigger thing of it and it\u2019s only a small moment from the whole wedding. Better to let it go and enjoy the rest of the evening rather than taking up the bride\u2019s time. Also, little girl does need to learn that things won\u2019t always go her way.", "NTA. Usually the bouquet toss isn\u2019t for kids anyway. You did the right thing and apologized for knocking her out of the way, you really didn\u2019t mean to, and she probably shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place!", "NTA. You didn\u2019t see her and tried to make up for it - plus, the idea of a little kid being the next to get married in a room of single adult women is\u2026 not great.", "NTA, the bouquet toss is always awkward. Just move on with your life. Doing more will prolong or exacerbate the awkwardness. Who cares if an 8yo got butt-hurt? Sounds amusing.", "NTA. It's a stupid tradition that says the woman who catches the bouquet will be next to get married so children don't usually take part. But it's not a big deal either way.\n\nI was at a wedding once where the bride threw the bouquet, we all took a step backwards and it landed on the floor.", "I hate the garter toss. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s not for kids. The man who catches the garter has to put it on the bouquet Catcher\u2019s leg. I saw that at a wedding once, and the man just put it on the girl\u2019s arm. \n\nHate the garter toss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't intentionally body-check a child :-)", "NTA - it was an accident.", "NTA. People coddle kids too often, wanting to let them win at everything they ever try, get everything they ever want, and win every trophy just for trying. You caught the boquet.", "You know, after reading this I realize that was part of my concern. Because I haven't been to many formal weddings (and especially not formal catholic/christian weddings), I'm only vaguely familiar with the traditions. I didn't know it wasn't common for children to take part in the flower toss.\n\nLike I know my dad's niece caught the bouquet at my parents wedding. (I know the story because when she grew up and got married herself, my parents took the photo of her as a little girl catching the bouquet and turned it into a card saying \"took you a while, but congrats on getting married\", playing on that idea of \"whoever catches the bouquet gets married next\") \n\nSo maybe that's why I was like \"oh crap, I committed a taboo by not letting the child catch the bouquet\".", "yeah thats the attitude the bride had lmao.\n\nTo my shame, there's pictures of the incident she and her brother were cackling over lol. It sure looks like I'm checking the poor girl, hopefully they'll tell the story as it was and not that I was one of those \"outta my way kid! I'm single and need to get married next damn it!\" bridesmaids", "oof, glad we skipped that part lol. Was no garters at this wedding, just the bouquet. I wouldn't have let anyone at that wedding near my upper thighs. (Not that they probably could have, with the dress the bride made me wear rofl)", "I guess it varies from event to event, but I've been to some where the guests have been drinking for a while before the bouquet toss and boy, it was vicious. I still don't think you did anything wrong. If the bride wasn't mad and the kids parents said let it go, I would let it go.", "Ha! You made me laugh about being single and wanting the bouquet. My SIL told me she would aim for me to catch it. I caught it when the woman standing in front of me fumbled. I was thrilled until about half an hour later when I noticed the woman who fumbled with the bouquet only had one arm!"]}
