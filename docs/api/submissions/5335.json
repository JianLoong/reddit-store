He dresses in all black, mainly listens to edgy metal/emo music (MCR is especially his favorite) and he talks about these things a lot. He is also heavily involved in fandom culture and he has a tendency to hyperfixate on kids shows his current fixation being some show called \"The Owl House\"(Hes autistic btw)Now i'll admit that when I first met him, my kid mind thought he was the coolest dude but since im not y'know, mentally 12, I can't help but find his behavior cringy now. We're both about to be in our mid 20s and he still dresses and acts like an edgy teenager. Just the other day I was talking to him on the phone and he started to excitedly talk about some band he started listening to and I said \"Dude do you not feel even a LITTLE embarassed?\" And he asked what I meant so I told him that nobody in the real world would take him seriously because he looks and acts like a teenager and that it was time to actually start acting like an adult. He went quiet after that and he hung up on me and ended up blocking me on pretty much all social media.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, hes a nice guy. He has a job that he works hard at, he helps his parents out around the house (he still lives with them because ofcourse he does\ud83d\ude44) and hes a really smart person. He was always one of the best students in our grade. I just think that if he grew up a little he would get very far in life and I figured I needed to be the one to motivate him to do that being his best friend.

He dresses in all black, mainly listens to edgy metal/emo music (MCR is especially his favorite) and he talks about these things a lot. He is also heavily involved in fandom culture and he has a tendency to hyperfixate on kids shows his current fixation being some show called \"The Owl House\"(Hes autistic btw)Now i'll admit that when I first met him, my kid mind thought he was the coolest dude but since im not y'know, mentally 12, I can't help but find his behavior cringy now. We're both about to be in our mid 20s and he still dresses and acts like an edgy teenager. Just the other day I was talking to him on the phone and he started to excitedly talk about some band he started listening to and I said \"Dude do you not feel even a LITTLE embarassed?\" And he asked what I meant so I told him that nobody in the real world would take him seriously because he looks and acts like a teenager and that it was time to actually start acting like an adult. He went quiet after that and he hung up on me and ended up blocking me on pretty much all social media.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, hes a nice guy. He has a job that he works hard at, he helps his parents out around the house (he still lives with them because ofcourse he does\ud83d\ude44) and hes a really smart person. He was always one of the best students in our grade. I just think that if he grew up a little he would get very far in life and I figured I needed to be the one to motivate him to do that being his best friend.

I like Legos (used to put little sets together while on calls at work).  Some of my best times have been playing games or watching said shows with my kids.\n\nI couldn't care less anymore.

That's normal and actually happens probably with 99% of someone's high school friends. Most of those separations happen mutually and gradually with time, except it sounds like your friend was blindsided by you being needlessly cruel to him. I've had a friend who likes ICP and Slipknot, etc since high school. I listen to George Strait, country always have. He joined the Army, got out, has a regular civilian job now but still wears the same stuff he used to, listens to the same stuff too, except now he drives a hearse as his cruising car. We're still friends and even if I don't understand exactly why he likes the things he likes, I never tried to make him feel bad about it or try to change. If he did, he wouldn't be the same person that I was friends with.

You seem more embarrassed on his behalf.\n\nThe world will pick you apart for everything you got, that\u2019s why nobody cares about social stereotypes and standards anymore.

Music, cartoons, whatever. \n\nI'm in the latter half of my 30's and barreling right towards 40, and I am just now learning to not apologize for getting excited over things I enjoy.  I gained that little tic because of people like you who do nothing more that suck the joy out of other people's lives because you replaced your interests and hobbies with the BS idea of what being a grown up is.\n\nYou mocked him for enjoying a style of music, and you've made snide comments about him enjoying a popular cartoon that has a pretty sizable adult following. Unless he's planning on selling his soul to corporate, none of those hobbies will keep him from advancing in his chosen career. And even in corporate it won't matter much. \n\nHaving a shitty personality and the interpersonal skills of a pissed off honey badger will harm your career growth though!
