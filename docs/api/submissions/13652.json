When he\u2019s done, instead of putting it away, he shoves it in the crack between the back cushions on the couch. It isn\u2019t clearly visible unless you look from the back of the couch, but the way it is placed in the cushions, it could definitely make contact with a kid if they flopped into it. \n\nThis has been going on for months and I keep telling him he has to put it away because the girls jump and roll and flop around on the couch and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t see the glass and they are going to hurt themselves when they bonk into it or shatter it. I grab the glass if I see it, or remind him to put it in the dishwasher. He still keeps doing it and I told him if he can\u2019t remember he should sit in a different part of the couch or get up as soon as he\u2019s done and put it in the kitchen so he can try to break the habit. \n\nLast night when he did it I said that the girls could get hurt (which I have said before) and that it will be his fault. He was like \u201cyou would tell me it was my fault?!\u201d And I said yes. He got really upset and said I had no empathy.

I said that he needed to focus on breaking the habit on not how I had \u201cwronged\u201d him by saying it would be his fault. \n\nHe said I was gaslighting him and had no empathy.

But he does this repeatedly despite conversations about the potential for harm. He is CHOOSING to do something that he acknowledges could harm one of the kids. So yeah, if one of them gets hurt by it, it would be his fault. Instead of just taking accountability for his actions and changing his behavior, he is turning it back on you using some of reddit's favorite (and misused) buzzwords/phrases. Nothing about what you are doing suggests that you lack empathy and you are not gaslighting him. \n\nTBH, I am not sure how much of a real risk the glass poses, but the fact that he is more concerned about casting himself as the victim than he is about the potential harm to your children is concerning.", "NTA. Is he really that lazy? It would be his fault - the glass wouldn't be hiding in the couch if not for him.", "NTA I'm as petty as they come. He would find his dirty glass under his pillow, in his car, in a shoe.  Every annoying place I could find.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a grubby child. Tell him to stop shoving dirty glassware into the couch. Get off his butt and move the 6 inches it would take to set it on a side table or actually get up and bring it to the kitchen. It would ABSOLUTELY be his fault if one of your kids got hurt because he\u2019s too lazy to put his dirty glass where it belongs.", "NTA but your husband is a AH with this behavior.  Put the glass sway in a proper place like the kitchen sink", "NTA he sounds very immature", "NTA Your husband continues a stupid habit that sets the stage for an easily foreseeable bad outcome. If your kids come & flop on the sofa, break the glass, and end up with stitches, it\u2019s his fault because he continued to do something that created a dangerous situation. \n\nIf he left a loaded gun in the sofa cushions & something terrible happened, would it be his fault? Why yes! Yes it would.\n\nSomeone is being gaslit here, and it isn\u2019t him.", "NTA. Your husband is doing something very stupid, something that can cause injury to others. Dirty glasses do not belong in the couch cushions. How bizarre for him to think that's a good place for them. How would he feel if you stuffed dirty dishes or used tampons in the couch cushions?\n\nIt is totally appropriate for you to point out that what he is doing in dangerous, and yes, for you to point out that if someone gets hurt it would be his fault. He is being negligent.", "NTA. Why is this em effer placing glassware in the cushions? How could such a thing be a habit?  The f@cker can't lean forward and place his drinking vessel on a table? He is lazy, irresponsible and pathological. He's forcing you to play a parental role in your marriage because he can't make good decisions. Treat him like a child and rescind his glassware privileges. From here on out, he will be limited to plastic sippy cups like the other children.", "NTA - Your husband shoves glass in sectionals. I didn't even know that was a thing. It's like he is intentionally booby-trapping your couch.", "NTA - So, you\u2019re supposed to have empathy for his laziness that could hurt one or both of your kids\u2026 HELL NO!", "NTA. Let me put it this way, if you were looking to adopt and your were having a visit to check your home was suitable for kids, that would be flagged as a potential risk and would be a red flag to the visitor. It's definitely dangerous, kids jump, climb and generally use furniture part of the play environment. Your concerns are valid.", "Of course NTA.   \nYou have mentioned it tons of times, and offered many alternatives, even for you to do it in his place, because he never does.\n\nHim being focused on \"the way you said that it would be his fault\", is just a way to deflect his responsibility, and not try to change a habit that obviously needs to be changed.", "NTA. Sorry, but your husbands sounds dumb, lazy and incredibly immature", "NTA\n\nWhat the actual f--- is wrong with your husband?  Who the hell does this kind of thing?", "NTA", "NTA. Buy him plastic tumblers for Father's Day (from the kids) that say \"daddy's couch glasses\"", "NTA - he's the AH for mis-using the word \"gaslighting,\" which has become yet another word that has lost all meaning, and is just basically a conversational weapon that people thrown during arguments.  \n\nWhere's his \"empathy\" for the girls getting hurt due to his actions, or you having to constantly put his glass away?", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve told him repeatedly that his habit is making you uncomfortable AND might be a danger for your kids. He chooses to keep ignoring you, which is already not a good look on him.

It\u2019s absurd how many people use this as their go to when they have no idea what it means. He\u2019s even more an ass for trying to use it against you.", "He stayed in bed until it was time for him to go to work and when I tried to talk to him he said that he doesn\u2019t care about the injury issue, he cares that I would blame him if the girls got hurt. I was hoping that maybe he had thought about it and realized he was being silly.", "NTA. EMPATHY? for what? For him doing something you repeatedly told him to stop? And telling you are gaslightinh you lol stop telling him about it.", "NTA he's being reckless the glass breaks it will be his fault because he's not putting it in the proper place it's not the same as a car accident.", "NTA you are not wronging him. He is deliberately doing something that is a danger to your children. Did you baby proof your home? He need to understand that this is part of keeping your children safe. If he is not coherent enough after having an alcoholic drink to clean it up, maybe he shouldn\u2019t be drinking.", "Not the same. Many car accidents require two people, have outside influences or extenuating circumstances.\n\nThis injury would be solely the result of something he decided to or not to do.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Empathy is NOT the problem.  You have common sense and your husband does not.", "So his takeaway is NOT that the girls can get hurt, but that he would be at fault?  Well, he would be at fault, 100% but that's not what he should be taking away from this.  Your husband is a clueless AH.", "Hide his glass whenever you find it until he has no more whiskey glasses. Who tf stores glasses in couch cushions?", "ESH\n\n\nHe's acting dumb and you like to nag and play the blame game. Just pick up the glass.\n\n\n Being married and raising kids is plenty enough to complain about a glass, and I'm sure you both are picking up after each other and everyone else. I don't go to my wife and complain everytime a hairbrush is left out, I just put it away. Save your sanity and deescalate a little.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
