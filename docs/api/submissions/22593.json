My oldest is Bri (17f) and my youngest Emy (12f).\n\nBri started going out with this guy named Jake recently and I found him kind and respectful and I was very happy for her. Jake has a little sister named Ava who is exactly Emy's age which made me excited because I thought they could be friends, so Jake would bring Ava over sometimes. \n\nThe issues is Emy and Ava are very different. Emy is more preppy and outgoing while Ava is very nerdy and into things like anime which Emy isn't interested in. Emy began complaining and saying she didn't like Ava, so we stopped bringing her over.\n\nOne weekend, I had to cover a shift for a co-worker, and the babysitter cancelled. I asked Bri if she could watch Emy, but Bri said she already had plans with Jake. I suggested her bringing Emy over and having her hang with Ava, and Bri agreed.\n\nEmy complained the entire car ride, but I told her to please put up with her just for one afternoon.\n\nWhen I get off work, I suddenly am getting spammed with calls from Bri yelling and saying Emy did something awful to Ava. Apparently Emy started group face-timing her friends, and started poking fun at her. She said it was harmless at first, but then they started poking fun at her looks, her outfit, etc and Ava started bawling and told Jake who screamed at Emy until she left the house in tears. She was kicked out onto the porch steps, and was still there when I went to pick her up. \n\nWhen Bri got home, she told me I'd better punish Emy because now her relationship was on a strain. I told her I'd never want that, but Jake was also in the wrong for kicking out a little girl. It's unfortunate what happened, but you really can't force girls to like eachother.\n\nWe got into it and she told me I didn't care that Emy hurt Ava, and I said I really didn't think it was that big of a deal.\n\nBri is now not talking to me, and I don't know what to do.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689716132, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153b5p8/aita_for_telling_my_eldest_daughter_i_dont_care/", "score": 1134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Making her sit on the step until your arrival could be problematic depending on how long she was left to sit there but I can completely understand the BF not wanting a bully in his house harming his sister. You need to step up and parent your younger daughter. Consequences are required.", "So to summarize\n\nYou thought Emy and Ava would be friends, they're not and that's fine.  \n\nYour babysitter cancelled, so Bri graciously agreed to turn her date into a babysitting evening.\n\nEmy proceeded to bully Ava, to the point of tears. She also included others in the bullying, ganging up on Ava, in her own home. \n\nJake protected his sister and reacted appropriately to seeing his little sister being bullied.\n\nYour bully daughter, sat on some steps. I'm assuming because she was not welcome in their home for y'know... being a bully. \n\nBri, who has a dog in both races, has stated the obvious. That you should punish your daughter for y'know... being a bully. \n\nHas it ever occurred to you that maybe... you should parent your kid? Parent is a verb.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nAnd while others have done a pretty great job here explaining why, I'd like to point out two things that I think are really important in this situation, with regards to your ridiculous assertion that \"I said I really didn't think it was that big of a deal\" and that the only issue here was that \"you really can't force girls to like each other\":\n\n1. This isn't about the two girls not liking each other at all. Emy didn't just argue with Ava or  or even have a clash of temperaments. She didn't even just sit there and mock her by herself. *Emy deliberately and maliciously Facetimed SEVERAL OTHER KIDS and got them involved in bullying Ava as a group*, cruelly picking her apart bit by bit, continuing even as they saw her crying, until someone finally stepped in.\n\nWhich brings us to the other really important thing that I haven't seen mentioned:\n\n2. Kids Emy and Ava's age *regularly commit suicide SPECIFICALLY because of this kind of group bullying and humiliation*. Young kids taking their lives because they think they have no other recourse to get away from their bullies.\n\nThis is not nothing. It's everything. You are raising a sadistic bully who intentionally set up another little girl in her own home to be completely humiliated by an entire group of kids, to the point where she was absolutely bawling, just because your kid didn't like her or share her interests. If you don't nip this in the bud now, Emy WILL be responsible for destroying someone's mental health at some point . . . and that's a best case scenario. Worst case, your kid is going to get someone killed. So yeah, YTA.", "YTA.  You are not only raising a bully, you are also condoning her actions.  No, you cannot force girls to like one another, but a decent mother would raise her daughter to treat others with respect, even those they do not get along with.  This is a parenting failure.", "YTA.\n\n> can't force girls to like each other\n\nThat's not what happened, don't act like that's the situation. Your daughter blatantly picked on this other girl, and called in other girls to join her. Your daughter is a bully, congratulations. Since you seem so apathetic, I assume she learned her AH behavior from you.", "So you don\u2019t care that your younger daughter is a bully?  \nCongrats, you are on the way to raising a bully.\n\nYou think it is wrong for Jake to kick out his sister\u2019s bully?  What if it as the other way around?  You would be okay if Ava was bullying Emy at your house.  You would expect Bri should just accept it isn\u2019t a big deal and let Ava bully her little sister cause kicking a little girl out is wrong?\n\nYTA", "YTA and you know YTA \n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t force girls to like each other\u201d \nTrue, but you can teach Emy how to be respectful and not enable her shitty behaviour.", "\u201cYou really can\u2019t force girls to like each other\u201d yet this is what you were trying to do.

I\u2019d also be coercing my kid to apologize to Ava.\n\nAnd I would be seriously supervising my kid\u2019s social life for a long time and providing some coaching in how to be a human.

My oldest is Bri (17f) and my youngest Emy (12f).\n\nBri started going out with this guy named Jake recently and I found him kind and respectful and I was very happy for her. Jake has a little sister named Ava who is exactly Emy's age which made me excited because I thought they could be friends, so Jake would bring Ava over sometimes. \n\nThe issues is Emy and Ava are very different. Emy is more preppy and outgoing while Ava is very nerdy and into things like anime which Emy isn't interested in. Emy began complaining and saying she didn't like Ava, so we stopped bringing her over.\n\nOne weekend, I had to cover a shift for a co-worker, and the babysitter cancelled. I asked Bri if she could watch Emy, but Bri said she already had plans with Jake. I suggested her bringing Emy over and having her hang with Ava, and Bri agreed.\n\nEmy complained the entire car ride, but I told her to please put up with her just for one afternoon.\n\nWhen I get off work, I suddenly am getting spammed with calls from Bri yelling and saying Emy did something awful to Ava. Apparently Emy started group face-timing her friends, and started poking fun at her. She said it was harmless at first, but then they started poking fun at her looks, her outfit, etc and Ava started bawling and told Jake who screamed at Emy until she left the house in tears. She was kicked out onto the porch steps, and was still there when I went to pick her up. \n\nWhen Bri got home, she told me I'd better punish Emy because now her relationship was on a strain. I told her I'd never want that, but Jake was also in the wrong for kicking out a little girl. It's unfortunate what happened, but you really can't force girls to like eachother.\n\nWe got into it and she told me I didn't care that Emy hurt Ava, and I said I really didn't think it was that big of a deal.\n\nBri is now not talking to me, and I don't know what to do.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sent to the curb is about the most polite outcome possible.", "> he responded to the bullying of his sister in what sounds like a manner normal for someone his age.\n\nBy acting like a bully\u2026\n\n>Correcting her behavior and parenting her is not his responsibility.\n\nBut not bullying a child is his responsibility.  I have met MANY asshole children.  You know how many I have screamed at?  Zero.", "I get being nerdy as I'm pretty nerdy myself. It's just the way I read it seemed like, \"my kid is this cool preppy girl and the other ugh is so nerdy.\" That could be projection though. Lol Agreed that her not caring about her daughter literally bullying another child is bad.", "Nerdy is a neutral descriptor unless you're OK with bullying said nerdy kid based on nerdiness, as OP seems to be. \n\nOP is around my age, and Jock/Prep vs Nerds/Alts was so ridiculous when we were teens (especially with the Post-Columbine tensions). It's clear she hasn't grown past it.", "She only cried because someone finally called her out on her actions. Doesn\u2019t sound like Mom ever does.", "Yea, it varies by states. I just looked up the age for nyc recently and found out there is no set age.", "I seriously doubt she felt physically unsafe. She just didn\u2019t like being called out on her actions, that is why she went outside. The difference is that she was experiencing consequences for her own actions, and he was defending his little sister from an incredibly cruel and calculating harassment. And seeing how it is likely the only punishment she is going to get, I hope it will be enough for her to reconsider her actions going forward. But it doubt it.", "They didn't bully her.  They yelled at her for her crappy behavior.", "Enabler.", "I getcha, reading it back in hindsight you can tell the angle she's saying it is probably on the old mean girl side. But initially reading it at face value, nothing wrong inherently saying that lol but obviously me and you using it can have some wild variations from someone like her and her daughter lol", "But 12 years old talking is bullying?\n\nThey were both bullies", "I am not the one who watched my boyfriend abuse my little sister and then got mad it might have screwed up my social life\u2026\n\nI wonder how Bri will feel when Jake starts screaming at her or their children for doing something he doesn't like.  It is scary that his first reaction was to scream at a child.", "I agree. \"Nerdy\" is often a compliment but there's a good chance it wasn't meant to be in this context. OP and the younger daughter are TA. Edit to add she should've made her walk home.", "No they weren't. She expected to get away with her bullshit and got called out, and made to take a time out, which is not bullying.  Neither is yelling at her and telling her to knock it the fuck off.  Why are you so willing to protect a little monster?", "Emy is that you?"]}
