I grew up in another city and went to college on a different coast and wasn\u2019t close with them, spending only 6 Christmas with them growing up. I visited everyone in person once when I moved so they know I\u2019m living in the same city.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty good cook and baker, so when I was invited to a potluck family party at my grandparents\u2019 I brought chicken stew which received a lot of praise. One of my aunts asked if I also bake and I said yes, showing them a few pics of my baked goods. My cousin Lisa (30f) then invited me to her little girl gathering, telling me it\u2019s a drink and dessert party and that the theme is chocolate.\n\nI made a beautiful white chocolate cake for the party. It wasn\u2019t big as Lisa told me there would be like ten people attending but because it was small I was able to make it a little fancy with silver and white winter decorations. Everyone exclaimed how beautiful the cake was and when Lisa put it on the table it stood out as the rest was different shades of chocolate brown. My cake was praised. The food and drink were delicious. I hung out with my cousins and met Lisa\u2019s friends and her husband\u2019s family. I thought everyone was nice.\n\nLater, Lisa called me, not exactly complaining but telling me next time I should keep to the theme of the party. I told her I did as white chocolate IS chocolate. Lisa said that her husband\u2019s sister and a couple of nieces thought it was inappropriate of me to bring a dish that stood out so much, completely ignoring the party theme. They felt all everyone talked about was my cake. They asked Lisa to tell me to \u201ctone it down\u201d or don\u2019t invite them or me to the same party because they can\u2019t stand someone so attention seeking.\n\nPersonally I don\u2019t think I did anything wrong but this is a group of three people thinking the same thing, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1703119483, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18na1oe/aita_for_bringing_white_chocolate_cake_when_asked/", "score": 4049, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wanted a chocolate party without white chocolate, she should have said that.\n\nAbsent other instruction, you honored the theme. I'm sensing that Lisa is just jealous of your baking/cooking skills.\n\nFYI for the future - and I'm sure you know this - but white chocolate contains no cocoa / cacao solids (and sometimes not even cocoa butter), so it's debatable whether it's chocolate at all. Also, many people who like chocolate explicitly do not like white chocolate. I suspect even if you had asked Lisa her opinion on white chocolate, she would have still found a reason to be unhappy.", "I'm tempted to call you an asshole for saying white chocolate is chocolate because it definitely is *not*. It contains no cocoa solids and shouldn't be called chocolate at all. That being said, it seems people enjoyed your cake and Lisa seems too controlling about this. NTA.", "NTA \n\nLisa is jealous. Plain and simple. I guarantee NO ONE said those things to her. No one. She\u2019s lying to you because everyone loved your beautiful cake. I love that you did something different!  Let me edit something here.. I\u2019m no way trying to sound harsh to Lisa. But I do feel it\u2019s jealousy. It\u2019s ok to be different and you filled the theme. They didn\u2019t say \u201cbring all brown chocolate \u201c!", "I hate white chocolate but NTA. She (and her friends) sounds jealous.", "NTA.

However, regarding the theme I think your contribution is a lovely variety.\n\nNAH", "ESH \nAs a baker you should know that white chocolate isn't chocolate, but that is the only small reason why I included you when saying ESH. However, your cousin's family is way out of line.  No one told you they wanted \"average\" desserts so that other desserts wouldn't be out shined!\n\nIn fact, no one should ever ask a good baker to tone it down.  People want good and/or fun foods.  They probably talked more about you to because you are so new to the family.", "NTA - I suppose she should\u2019ve specified milk or dark chocolate. White chocolate is towing the line but still falls under the theme.\n\nI wonder if it was less about being white chocolate, and more jealousy because your cake was just more professionally decorated?", "NTA what is wrong with people being so insecure? Chocolate theme was met with your white chocolate cake. She specifically asked you to bring a baked good after seeing your pics. She knew your talent and sounds like these other people are kinda jerks. Don\u2019t doubt yourself or your talent. It sounded beautiful and fit the theme and season wonderfully!\n\nEdit: to all of you who are being well ick about OP not following the chocolate theme, have you never watched a baking show??

Do what makes you happy, you feel confident making, and proud of bringing to a gathering.

I love chocolate, it's my favorite dessert. White chocolate is absolutely not it. If I went to a chocolate themed dessert party and everything was white chocolate, I'd be so disappointed.

It should be a place for people to get together and be happy and sharing joy. The women who complained about you seemed to miss the point.

They are just jealous that your cake stood out - what a silly thing to get upset about.", "ESH\n\nWhite chocolate is a specific thing with its own flavor, and I can understand not appreciating the semantics game you played here to justify your choice.\n\nHowever the reason they used to criticize you - that it stood out too much - is also shitty.", "NTA. Your cake sounds lovely. A few women being mad that you did *too good a job* gifting them all a cake shows they're kinda lame. That said, white chocolate isn't actually chocolate.

I don't understand the level of pettiness!", "NTA lmao. Do those nieces happen to be her husband's sister's children? Cause I'm thinking husband's sister is just. Y'know. The kind of person who would uninvite someone from Future Parties because their cake was too cool T.T", "ESH. Her reaction was dramatic and DEFINITELY wrong, but if she asked you to make a cake and mentioned a chocolate theme, jumping to white chocolate without clarifying is weirdo behavior. She pretty much asked you to make a chocolate cake, which when people say \u201cchocolate cake\u201d it has a meaning (and the meaning isn\u2019t white chocolate!). It *does* seem attention seeking to me. Anyone in their right mind would take the chocolate theme to mean actual chocolate (and no, white chocolate is NOT chocolate). Acting like you didn\u2019t know what she meant is weaponized incompetence. Just admit that you heard chocolate and wanted to do something creative/outside of the box, so you did white chocolate! I also like to be creative with my baking. I get it. But if somebody asked me for chocolate cake, I would never present them with white chocolate cake and then act like they had no reason to be confused or upset. A chocolate cake with some white chocolate accents/decor? Fair game. But fully white chocolate\u2026. Is not what they were looking for. \n\nObviously, nobody would\u2019ve expected the extreme reaction she had - it should be okay to have some fun with it but it seems like your cake was potentially the main dessert. It would\u2019ve been so easy to say \u201cI\u2019m thinking of doing a white chocolate cake, is that okay?\u201d  - some folks don\u2019t like white chocolate. \n\n(TLDR: If I were her I would\u2019ve kept my mouth shut, but internally I would probably be thinking you were attention seeking too \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f)", "I bet no one said anything.

Please dont be all obtuse and pretend you dont understand that a white ass cake when everything was supposed to be shades of brown comes off as attention seeking and purposely wanting to be the \"unique and standout\" desert", "NTA what a ridiculous thing for your cousin to be upset about.  I wonder if she was really upset that your cake got more attention. \n\nHonestly these women must not have much to worry about in life if they have time to pick apart people\u2019s desert choices.

All this debate about whether or not the cake was on theme seems moot because you\u2019d have to be so petty to take any of it THAT seriously. It\u2019s chocolate for heavens sake. Maybe white chocolate isn\u2019t literal chocolate but it\u2019s still called \u201cchocolate\u201d so it fits in theme. AND there were plenty of traditional chocolate desserts to choose from.

He only likes fruity (think Skittles) or white chocolate candy.  We always forget & then are scrambling to get him a treat at holidays.  So in our family, you would probably have saved the day!!!", "NTA it sounds like they were just jealous of all the attention you were getting.

Having a white chocolate option just added variety to the dark and milk chocolate desserts. While white chocolate isn\u2019t technically chocolate, I\u2019d say it\u2019s still in bounds for the theme. It\u2019s not that deep. Lisa is just jealous that your cake stole the show.", "I am gonna bet that no one said any of those things, Lisa is just upset because you got positive attention. \n\nNTA", "White chocolate isn\u2019t chocolate and I hate it with a white hot intensity.

I say this with all the Christmas spirit I can muster: eff those people and their little grinch hearts.  You keep doing your confections, OP.  Don\u2019t let the haters get you down.", "So\u2026I have a bit of a different take on this than others.\n\nFirstly, yeah, Lisa definitely sounds jealous. But\u2026it was her party, and you completely showed her up. Can you blame her? It\u2019s like showing up to a ball and your dress looking way better than the host\u2019s\u2014maybe you didn\u2019t do anything morally wrong, but it\u2019s still not cool, and should be avoided. I don\u2019t think Lisa is the ah for being sad no one touched her cake. \n\nYour cake stood out *because* it was white chocolate. It doesn\u2019t seem fair to me that your cake got all the love, not necessarily because it was the best tasting (although it may have been, I don\u2019t have enough info to say) but rather because it was so *different*. That doesn\u2019t seem fair to me to the other bakers (Lisa included) who worked just as hard, and wanted their cakes to receive love too. \n\nAnd, while yes, I get that white chocolate has \u201cchocolate\u201d in the name\u2026white chocolate isn\u2019t chocolate. It doesn\u2019t have that enough cocoa in it to be chocolate. It doesn\u2019t taste like chocolate. And no, it doesn\u2019t look like chocolate either. And I think it\u2019s generally understood, when people say \u201cchocolate\u201d\u2026they don\u2019t mean white. \n\nMaybe in this situation that\u2019s not a big deal\u2026but easily could have been. \n\nFor instance. I *love* chocolate. There are very few desserts I like that aren\u2019t chocolate. So if I was your cousin and I said \u201cplease make me a chocolate cake for my birthday, I know you\u2019re a wonderful baker\u201d and you brought *white* chocolate\u2026I\u2019d be *pissed*. Because\u2026that\u2019s not what I asked for.\n\nSo\u2026I\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say YTA, because you made the host feel bad, and because, no, white chocolate isn\u2019t chocolate. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t think you did anything morally wrong, or intended any harm. But I do think you\u2019re the one in the wrong here, out of everyone, if that makes sense", "Sorry but YTA\n\nWhite chocolate actually isnt chocolate and doesnt deserve the title.\n\nWhen people think chocolate they think brown.\n\nYou should have checked with her, you totally stole attention, and maybe not on purpose, but you basically arrived to the wedding in a princess gown when the theme was evening wear and then tried to argue that the princess gown was a dress.", "Sorry, YTA \n\n\"The theme is chocolate\" is pretty clear. Should she have said, \"please make a brown chocolate cake?\" No - because pretty much everyone would understand that acceptable variations are things like German chocolate cake, or maybe red velvet cake. Hell - even checkerboard cake or marble cake would have been fine. \n\n\"White chocolate *is* chocolate\" my ... aunt fanny. If you have to explain - that is, make an excuse - why your cake fits the theme, that's a pretty good clue that your cake does not, in fact, fit the theme. \n\nOP - you succeeded! You stood out, you got your attention, and - bonus! - you even get to be the aggrieved party. Good job! \n\nWhite chocolate may be considered chocolate by some, since it contains cocoa butter, but I've got a body lotion that contains cocoa butter and I don't consider that chocolate.", "NTA. Change your friends, be more discerning choosing them. Why hang out with dimwits like that?", "NTA.    I do not understand the hate on white chocolate.  I LOVE white chocolate, it is the dark and milk chocolate I pass on.\n\nI would have been thrilled with a white chocolate cake.", "White chocolate is not chocolate. It is called that but does not contain cocoa solids or other characteristics of real chocolate.

I wouldn't bother with them again.", "NTA even if white chocolate is not considered chocolate for some is really not a big deal. Whoever was complaining was just jealous. Make sure you decline any requests of \"help\" in the kitchen from any of these people. Today they're jealous, tomorrow they'll ask you with a big smile to bake a cake for their kid or something for free.", "NTA just because they said a chocolate party it wasn't clear that the main priority was the aesthetic of everything being matchy shades of brown chocolate. You're not attention seeking - they just are upset their items didn't get the same amount of attention. It's so shallow.\n\nEdif to add - I'm not a big white chocolate fan (ya it isn't really chocolate blah blah blah) but in my opinion it is widely accepted as chocolate so it's fair play to include at a chocolate party. Most potluck style events you want some variety - you brought variety to the table.", "People who take themes this seriously take the fun out of it. White chocolate is still widely considered chocolate. It comes in boxes of chocolate as another type of chocolate.", "NTA. \n\nWhite chocolate is technically not chocolate; however, in common parlance it *is* chocolate. Heck, you can go to a fancy chocolatier and see white chocolate on offer. So for the cake you brought definitely satisfied the chocolate theme. \n\nThe only way I\u2019d consider you might be T A is if you know/ we\u2019re told that Lisa is a firm/ a hardcore \u201cwhite-chocolate-is-not-chocolate\u201d camp.", "NTA.
