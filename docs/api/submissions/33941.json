You are correct but your mom is the one who needs to set the boundaries.

Is she strong enough to revoke all monetary support? Let them figure it out on their own? Find their own babysitter, etc? I know this will mean your mom won't see the kids for a while as they will threaten and enact that punishment but this is the kind of behavior that won't stop unless your mom puts her foot down.
