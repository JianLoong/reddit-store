He said it's none of my business and it's not like he's forcing her to give them money, she can stop if she wants. I said that's not the point and he's acting like a spoiled brat.

Your parents come from a culture where they expect to be commended, respected, and financially supported by their kids for simply doing what is legally and morally required of any parent.\n\nThey are telling you how much better their controlling bullshit is than the western way while pretending that western families throw their kids to the wolves like a ward of the state getting kicked out of foster care.", "NTA but your mom need to stop being the punching bag.

Nope, sorry, if a member of my immediate family, particularly my sibling, is disrespecting our parent to this degree, they're getting called the fuck out. And that's not even considering the fact that you were *personally* impacted by their moving into your house.\n\nIt takes a village, right? They've been depending on family to live their lives? They've benefitted from your cooking and cleaning? It's absolutely your place to throw in your two cents. Your brother and SIL are entitled little shits, and if either of my sisters had this audacity, they would never hear the end of it from me.

You are correct but your mom is the one who needs to set the boundaries. It sounds like Alex is manipulative and is punishing your mom for a simple misunderstanding, and his wife goes along with whatever he says. Does your mom understand that her son is manipulating her? Is she strong enough to revoke all monetary support? Let them figure it out on their own? Find their own babysitter, etc? I know this will mean your mom won't see the kids for a while as they will threaten and enact that punishment but this is the kind of behavior that won't stop unless your mom puts her foot down. She's done nothing wrong but Alex will cast all blame on her and you for calling out their behavior. I'm so sorry OP. This sucks.", "Look just to get it clear:\n\nIf a person says: hey there's this cool thing happening, mind if i take the kids, then it's implied they are paying, if payment has to be done.\n\nSo your brother was not wrong to be 'angry' for the bait and switch.\n\nThere's also some truth in you not having a say in how your mother interacts with her other child.\n\nIn general though your brother sounds exhausting.\n\nSo yeah, YTA, but I wouldn't lose sleep over it", "NTA.", "ESH.\n\n>Alex and his wife had a lot of help off of our mom.
