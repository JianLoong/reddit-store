She temporarily moved in with her uncle. We plan to get married. I'm planning on getting a job meaning I have to quit uni.\n\nThat's when my dad 37m found out he was outraged. He's very strict, stoic and cold. He called me an idiot not attending uni and that I was delusional to think I could support a family when I have no job or degree whilst trying to be new parents. He then made an offer. He would turn his study into a bedroom for the baby, me and my Gf would move into my room. He said I will finish my degree and he will handle everything else. Whilst I'm at uni my mum will stay home with the baby. He also paying for gf's uni. But he said this means we will have more chores at home and the household rules will be applied to both of us. I refused. My mum called and told us that they were in similar situation with me and that they know its hard to support a family. She also called me insensitive since my dad is taking on extra hours at work in preparation for our baby arrival and even cancelled his gym membership. I hung up.\n\nHowever he said that I will only be allowed to go outside the house for uni. Said any time not spent towards uni will be given to my son. Meaning no friends/parties. My friends also enlightened me to the way my future son won't see me as an authority figure. As my dad would be the bigger/stronger man as well as my son would see me obey a more dominant man so will lose respect for me as well as I won't be a provider. \n\nMy dad always made me feel insecure (he's 6'4 and very muscular with better skin, hair and has better facial features), whenever he's near me I feel small and ugly due to the size comparison/looks. He tried to get me to workout with him but he lifted like 3x the amount I did in our sessions to the point it was humiliating so I decided to stop. All my friends were taller/stronger than their balding aging dads. He likes to walk around the house shirtless, flex whenever he see's a mirror or at random times such as a random pec bounce to make my younger bro laugh. And most of his clothes are very tight. This just reinforces my insecurity. Its gotten to the point I don't even want to be in the same room as him to avoid comparing myself to him.\n\nHe told my Gf and now we are both arguing over it. She said she'll gladly take on some extra chores and rules for what he's offering. But I was more mad at him for telling my gf so I went to stay at my grandparents house to cool off. \n\nMy Gf says I should take the offer and apologise. She also spoke about it to my dad who has agreed to wear baggy clothes in the house if it makes me feel better. That made me even more mad cause now they were discussing me behind my back. I'm considering declining his offer and telling him to stop interfering with our lives. \n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1673721390, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bvqe6/wibta_if_i_told_my_dad_to_stop_interfering_in_my/", "score": 399, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Put aside your pride and think about what is best for your family. Having a baby is hard, even when you are fully prepared and plan for it. You have a golden opportunity to have some support. You are in a difficult situation; however, your father's conditions are not unreasonable. \n\n>Meaning no friends/parties. \n\nSweetie, that part of your life is over. Your kid is going to need a lot of time and attention. You are not going to have the mental bandwidth to do much else besides study and care for the baby. \n\n>my future son won't see me as an authority figure. As my dad would be the bigger/stronger man as well as my son would see me obey a more dominant man so will lose respect for me as well as I won't be a provider. \n\nThis is some serious i.n.cel crap thinking. It's bs. Your kid will respect you if you are there for him and you take the time to raise him. Your kid will respect your dad too. Respect for one does not automatically negate respect for the other.", ">He told my Gf and now we are both arguing over it.

But I was more mad at him for telling my gf so I went to stay at my grandparents house to cool off.\n\nYTA for NOT telling your girlfriend. that is such a selfish and awful thing to hide from her, your world isn't just all about you anymore because you have a family to think of now. you have a lot of work to do.", "YTA- your friends opinions are not accurate or helpful. Your dad is trying to be helpful but also in charge. What he\u2019s offering could really help you and gf get a leg up on life for your son. Your son will still see you as an authority if you live with him and parent him. This isn\u2019t a forever solution-3-4 years tops. However, if you can\u2019t stand your dad then it won\u2019t work. To be fair, if I was 19, having a baby, had an offer of a place to stay with supportive parents who would give me free childcare and pay my cost of living and education, I\u2019d feel like I won the lottery and would be all over it. But you and your gf need to have some serious conversations first.", "YTA. He's willing to house your baby, take care of him/her while you're at school, and pay for the education of you and your gf, in exchange for you guys doing chores around the house....and you're turning that down???? Wtf is wrong with you? \n\nI really think you should finish your degree. It opens so many doors for better paying jobs, which is really important now that you have a kid on the way. You'd be a fool not to take his offer.", "YTA. Your parents are willing to provide free room and board, free childcare, pay for TWO college degrees and that isn't enough for you? All because they expect you to do chores and contribute to the household? Child....\n\nThe thing about \"no parties.\" Kiddo, you're about to be a dad. You sacrificed the \"college experience\" and wild parties when you opted to become a young parent.\n\nIf you decline this incredibly loving and generous offer you are putting yourself, your soon to be wife and your child at a huge detriment. Huge. Raising a child is difficult. Raising a child in poverty is even more so. You need therapy for your insecurities. Dad has to wear different shirts so you can be around him? Grow up. Being an authority figure in your child's life has nothing to do with how many pushups your dad can do.\n\nIt's time for some tough love. You're being foolish and are sacrificing a lot just so you can drown in your insecurities.", "YTA, you've got a lot of insecurities to work on.", "YTA,  and unfortunately for your growing family you're very self-involved and short-sighted.

WAKE UP.    \n\n\nYour father's appearance, his size, his looks -- all of this is irrelevant.  It's time for you to put big boy pants on, think about what's best for your child, and deal with it.", "YTA. You're being offered a better future for you, your child,  and the mother of your child. Stop listening to your friends. Believe it or not, your parents know a lot more than they do.", "YTA if you think you can support your baby on your own. You're not going to he able to go to parties after the baby is born regardless of where you live.  The jealousy you have for your father is weird.", "YTA. your gf is right. take the offer. your dad is willing to house you, pay for your uni, and help with the baby in exchange for you doing chores. that is a wonderful offer and it shows he wants you both to have a good future and be able to take care of a baby. yes, it\u2019s true you will have to give up parties, but becoming a parent means a huge change in priorities. you need to set aside your pride and insecurities and accept the help. it\u2019s time to grow up.", "At this point I just hope the girlfriend accepts the dad's offer and break up with him", "100% YTA\n\nJust by doing the simple maths on your father\u2019s age, he has already gone through what you\u2019re about to, being a 19yo with a newborn.\n\nIf he managed to get through that and end up successful enough to offer you a golden ticket out of the situation you\u2019ve got yourself into, by not having the maturity to wrap up, then you should be taking it and thanking your lucky stars that he is actually helping you get an education and holding financial security in the early years, to be able to provide for your family in the later years yourself. \n\nPlus all you have to do is extra chores? This is a get out of jail free card mate, and whatever your thoughts towards your father, he is doing nothing but showing you an incredible amount of love.\n\nAs for the thing about having a good physique; I\u2019m just more impressed he managed to have a kid at 18, graft enough to get to a point he can offer you what he has, and still get in the gym.\n\nGet over it, parties are over, if you have no qualifications or further education the only jobs you\u2019re going to get at 19yo will not be enough to support a young family, you will get into a horrendous vicious cycle for you and your partner where you will be working pay check to pay check and have no time to further yourselves professionally because spare time is taken up in childcare.\n\nTake the offer, grow up and put your partner and unborn child first.", "YTA Going to be honest in your shoes...I would literally be kissing the ground my dad walks on. He says its raining pancakes I will just nod my head and say yes sir. He says jump I will ask how high you get the picture. Anything to remain in his good books. \n\nHes literally giving up his study, his body he worked years for and taking up extra hour shifts. I would feel so indebted. He would literally be able to do no wrong in my eyes after giving me a future. Could slap me around if he wants I wouldn't care. I don't think it dawns on you how much he is saving you. Your child will have a luxurious childhood surrounded by love and not living paycheck to paycheck. You will have a much higher paid job. Your gf/future wife won't be homeless. Ad the offer still stands after you yelled at him and ran away? Go back on your knees begging for forgiveness you got a wonderful dad.\n\nHowever if I was your dad? I would for sure force you to take this anyway i can. Sorry tough luck", "Kid, you have a long way to go in life.  Do NOT turn this down!  He is trying to help you, and your budding family have a better chance at life!  Being a parent is HARD, and EXPENSIVE!  So you have to help more at home, and give up a social life.  Guess what?  That's part of being a parent!  Do you honestly think, if you move out, get a job, and have a baby that you're still going to be able to go out, party, and act like a kid?  The answer is NO you won't.  You also sound really insecure.  Do you think your dad got to be where he is or how he's built (minus height) by not working for it?  Of course not.  He worked his butt off for it!  Of course he can lift more than you, NOW because he worked at it.  I have no doubt when he started he couldn't.\n\nPoint being YTA here, in all of it!  You're thinking of yourself, not the baby you helped create!", "YTA and poor baby having an immature child as a dad", "Lol \u201cno friends/parties\u201d\u2026 you think you\u2019ll be going to parties while raising a baby (and on a 19 year old\u2019s income)?

Also, your father will age, and inevitably not physically be the person he is now. Time stops for no man.\n\nThis is a win. \nTake the win.", "YTA his offer is the best you can get, not to mention he was your age when he had you. He\u2019s doing this because he\u2019s been in your shoes. Do it ffs", "YTA  And if you don't take this offer, I'm quite certain your fiance and child will, with or without you.  Stop with this whole 'he's bigger than me, I'm not the man when he's around' mysoginistic bullshit. No one cares and you sound patheticly insecure. You have a child to think of. period... stop being so fucking selfish.  At a minimum, whether to accept your father's offer should have been a joint decision between you and fiance. You no longer get to just make unilateral decisions in life. Your decisions now affect more than just you. What he offered is a hugely amazing gift, with very little ask in return.  A couple of rules that, while may be a little on the strict side, sound like you are indesperate need of. But you make it seem like he's asking you to bathe in hydrochloric acid. Communication skills really should have been something you learned prior to being married and a father, and they are currently not your strong suit.", "YTA. I hope your girlfriend will take the offer regardless of what you decide.", "Bro grow up. Your dad is right. Finish your degree. You have NO idea how hard a baby is. You will need the help. \n\nAlso, newsflash, you won't be going to parties anymore with a newborn at home. Time to grow up and tend to your responsibilities. \n\nSo much YTA. Get in therapy and deal with your insecurities. Get your priorities straight. Time to put away your childish pursuits and look after your kid. \n\nJesus christ.", "YTA - you have no idea how incredibly lucky you are to have been offered so much help! Your father is doing what is best for your future - something a father should be doing for his child! Perhaps when you mature a little, you'll realise how loving your dad really is. Pride aside, this is your family. And your family is 110% willing to help you!", "YTA. Dude. The fact is, your parents will watch the kid every day, and you can\u2019t expect them to also watch the baby while you \u201cparty\u201d. Like sorry, but you\u2019re going to be a dad so you will have to hang out and take care of the baby EVERY SINGLE DAY. That\u2019s your life man.

You aren't thinking of your child or your girlfriend, you're only thinking of \n*yourself*, which makes you a king-sized asshole.  LISTEN to what everybody, all who have FAR more life experience than you do, is telling you, instead of whinging about inconsequential shit like your father being taller, more muscular, whatever, than you.  This has no bearing whatsoever on anything, and that bullshit your friends spew....seriously??  Fact is, you are in no way mature enough to take on the responsibilities of fatherhood, otherwise you would see the opportunity in front of you.  You need all the help you can get, it's on offer, TAKE it.", "YTA. \n\nBut I'm wanting you to ask yourself this. Is it really worth the possibility of you not being able to care for your girlfriend and child in the case that things go south? So you drop out of school to get a full-time job. While it is great that you are willing to get a job to support your growing family, you might not have thought about what could happen if it takes awhile to find a job that allows you to afford a decent place to stay. Sure, lots of places have \"Now Hiring\" signs posted but that doesn't guarantee you will land one that will pay enough. You might have to take on a second or potentially third one depending on where you live due to how much rent is.  \n\nOnce you and girlfriend found out that she was carrying your child, your focus should be on what is going to be best for the child and your family. Yes, some of the rules your dad have seem a bit much (mainly the fruits and veggies for me) but you do know that if you decide to go on the path you seem dead set on, there are a lot more rules with some being a hell of a lot more controlling. You'll have to follow the rules your landlord has in place so you can continue to stay where you are. You'll have to follow the rules of the company you work for in order to keep the job that will allow you to pay for rent and the things you need for the child. \n\nFinally, I think that if you are able to, you should look into therapy for how you are feeling over all this.", "YTA - Take the deal bud. Your dad may be strict, but he is not wrong. Get a degree, get a good paying job and start your life off on the right foot. I'm not saying you should be bowing down and kissing his boot or anything, but he is giving you a solid out of the bind you guys are in. \n\nLife can suck for a couple years living at your folks' place, or it can suck for a lot longer. The faster you get your career off the ground the better.", "YTA. Put that baby's wellbeing first. Do not stress out your girlfriend. She's growing a person.  And ask your dad to throw in some therapy copays for you while he's being so generous so you can work on your insecurities.\n\nBaby first, independence later.  Be mature enough to accept help when it's offered with so few strings attached.", "YTA. You know what will really make your child not respect you? Watching you flounder through your life giving up opportunities because of your silly pride. Your dad is trying to help you be a better man, a man your kid could look up to. You want to sit around whining with your friends.", "Oh man, you are going to be really shocked by how much things cost. Okay. If your big focus is parties, you know what's awesome? Being able to negotiate with your parents for an evening off each week. Also, having the ready cash to pay for your drinks.\n\nThe path you want to take will lead to misery for the three of you. You will have years of struggle and pain. Your dad is making the best damn offer you're going to get anywhere. Take it.", "YTA. Being a real man means doing what's best for your GF and baby. Seems to me like your dad's offer is just that. I'm speaking from experience. I barely managed to make ends meet after having a kid at 18. That was 20+ years ago. I'm still struggling.

Both are full time jobs. It sounds like you will not need an income thanks to your father.\n\nBabies are not pack animals like puppies - they don\u2019t gravitate toward some alpha male and kill off the weaker ones.

It\u2019s time to grow up and go the right thing for your kid instead of whining about how you won\u2019t be able to party anymore, because let\u2019s be real, without a degree how are you even going to afford a babysitter, let alone everything else your son is going to need?", "YTA grow up you wanna play man but you're to scared to be one. Your dad offered you the world yet your mad cause no partying. You are no longer your number one concern", "YTA. This is an amazing opportunity, and I can't believe you'd let insecurities interfere. \nYou need to do what's best for your son. It's also what's best for your gf and you. If you can't do that, you can move out to avoid those restrictions and let your gf and son take the deal.", "YTA\n\nSorry to say, but the time for friends and partying are over.  Your main focus should be your kid and your dad is trying to help you see that. I am one that left school to get married, have kids, etc. while I don\u2019t regret it exactly, it is much harder to go back to school the longer you are out. Getting a degree or certificate can open doors that may not be available to you as a young struggling parent. \n\nAs for your GF and dad talking behind your back, he may be trying to gain insight to why u are refusing and since you won\u2019t talk to him, he is going to the next person who might know and can help.", "YTA. Grow up.", "Yta. Grow up and take this incredibly generous offer to help your family.", "LOL, you think you will have the money and time to go out to parties working retail/fast food jobs with a baby.  YTA.  Also, by spending your free time with the baby, he is giving you a huge opportunity to be established as the authority figure most people in your situation don't get, but instead you decide to listen to a bunch of dumbass kids that don't know anything.", "YTA. Reject his offer and see how far you get. You have no job, haven\u2019t finished uni, probably no money since you have no job, your girlfriend is about to drop your baby and you\u2019re whingeing cause your dad looks better.\n\nBabies are expensive from pampers, wet wipes, toys, clothes, food etc. Then you have rent, utilities, medical bills, car costs etc. Your father maybe strict but it sure as hell beats living in poverty trying to support a baby with no money.", "College usually takes 4-5 years. By the time you get a degree and the opportunity to have better-paying jobs and the ability to move into your own place, your child will only be 3-4 years old, almost certainly won\u2019t remember how much more manly you think your dad is than you. This is an amazing opportunity for all of you!! Don\u2019t let insecurity get in the way :( YTA", "YTA. How do you expect to be someone else\u2019s dad and you\u2019re this insecure about every little thing? Grow up", "YTA and you're also a dumbass.  If you have insecurity issues because your dad is still in shape and takes care of himself, then fix it by taking care of YOURrself, not running away from him.  Your parents are being phenomenal by offering all that they have to help you and your gf and baby out.  You're sitting here worried about how that might make you look?  Get over yourself, you'll be working a very hard life if you don't suck up your misplaced pride and take your dad's offer to get you thru uni and work towards a better life.  Also, stop being jealous of your dad, you should be proud that he hasn't let himself go.\n\nLastly, your friends didn't \"enlighten\" anyone because they sound as immature as you.", "Alright. We all know the verdict here. But OP I hope you read this with a clear head. \n\nFirst off, at your age parents are supposed to be parents. Someone experienced and older who's supposed to be the benchmark. Any shortcoming and we will resent them. But it's only when you are older that you realise they are people too. They can make mistakes. But ultimately they are trying to do their best just like the rest of us. \n\nYou might think your dad is trying to rub your insecurities in your face. But he isn't. He's just being a normal man. With quirks and faults. But with a great deal of love for his family. \n\nFor a man who has spent years working out he quit the the gym to help you. You don't realise how big a sacrifice it is. Every muscle he worked to cultivate will disappear. \n\nSecondly, your Grandparents. They aren't good people. Your father was once in your place. They disowned him. And you too. For 15 years. If you can forgive them why can't you forgive your father for all the perceives slights to you? \n\nHe is trying to give you what he needed from his parents then. We all treat people the way we want to be treated. He is setting the rules as lessons he might wish he knew. \n\nYou are 19. That's still very very young. (I'm 22 and still ask my mom when I want to go out. Ask not tell. It's because I trust her to guide me from dangers I might not see) \n\nI've read the rules he gave you. All of them I follow too. And it's not because I'm at my parents mercy or anything its because I respect them and believe they have my best interests at heart. \n\nYour father is a good man. He's making sacrifices now so you won't have to sacrifice anything in the future. Go talk to him man. Tell him what you told us and hear him out too.", "YTA. You won't be able to party with a child even if it isn't a restriction. The reason  your dad says that you need to dedicate your time to your kid is because it is your duty as a dad. A child doesn't respect it's father because he is big, strong and dominant. It's because his/her dad loves, cares and does what is best for them. \n\nYour dad never had any intention of making you feel inferior. He offered to wear baggy clothes for YOU.. honestly it sounds so silly and he still is trying to make the effort to make you feel better.. You should probably be showing off your dad  and get on a comparison scale with him....Seems like he already took in extra hours at work and canceled his gym subscription for YOUR kid. He is doing everything for you because he doesn't want you to suffer the way he did and because he loves you! \n\nYou've got amazing parents and a sensible girlfriend but TERRIBLE friends who have no clue of what real world is. Stop listening to your friends they will lead you to failure! You don't even have to listen to your parents... just use your common sense and you will know that you are making a mistake by quitting!", "Yes YTA. \n\nReading your comments was insightful. \n\nBeing a parent is one of the hardest things you can do; it's an emotionally crazy, mentally challenging and physically draining roller coasting and that never stops. Having a strong support network can easily be the glue that keeps your family together during those hard times. Bringing up a child with no security, no qualifications and no equity without a support network is like putting that roller coaster on super speed. Often families under this strain break and children suffer. \n\nYour 19, not much life experience. You are not looking at this clearly. You are not thinking about your pregnant partner who is probably under an immense amount of stress due to pregnancy and worrying about how she will feed and clothe her little one because your pride is more important. You don't sound emotionally mature enough to be a parent at this stage. \n\nYes your father has asked for conditions; no parties or friends (welcome to parenthood - should've thought about that before!) Your responsibility is to your partner AND child. You are basically being given a free baby sitter all day to finish your degree so YOU can get a better paid job to support YOUR family. Your gf is also being given a massive opportunity (which could be taken away because of your pride!!) and have her degree paid for which helps YOUR family in the long run and in return he expects you both to obey the rules and do extra chores and you don't feel that this is a fair compromise. Wake up and smell the coffee kid. You and your gf could be living in a substandard tiny apartment with no money as low paying jobs with a baby to feed as the alternative - I mean without being rude what's wrong with you?!\n\nYour gf may choose to accept and you can say you won't speak to your parents ever again but you are too prideful to come down off your high horse and out your child first. That's what a parent does, 24 hours a day. This isn't a job you can just quit from when you get bored. If your that worried about who the kid views as having the biggest **** then think about how they will feel thinking your pride was worth more to you than them!!\n\nApologise!! Do the right thing please OP for the sake of your child!", "YTA  I\u2019m going to try to be really gentle about this, assuming you read past the first three letters. Your dad\u2019s rules are kind of silly, but I had stricter rules both in college (went early admissions) and in the Army (needed a waiver to join before I turned 18) and honestly both environments still had a lot of freedom compared to parenting an infant and then toddler.\n\nThe next four years of your life are going to be hard. Harder than you currently understand or are capable of understanding. The friends telling you to go out on your own? They are going to evaporate. They will not be down for hanging out with you and GF while you change diapers and feed a baby. They will not watch your sick toddler so you don\u2019t miss a midterm. You know who will? Your fucking family dude.\n\nIn five years time you and GF will graduate, get jobs, move out, your kid will be in Pre-school, and you won\u2019t have massive school debts. You may have missed some hot 18+ movies and games but I hate to tell you this - you would have anyway as new parents. My son is 9 and I\u2019m still catching up on horror movies that came out when he was little.\n\nYour dad\u2019s rules about place settings and his special chair are kind of eccentric but compared to some dorm rules and barracks rules? Not shit bro. Honestly, many people would trade you.\n\nAs for your dad being tall and buff, um, idk what that has to do with anything? You still have some ability to grow until you\u2019re 25. Not much but a little, including brain chemistry. Maybe you can hit the gym with your dad and bond when your kid is a little bit older and get a solid relationship going because he seems like a good dude to me, and a pretty nifty grandpa.", "Ahhh, to be a naive young teen again, new to the world and thinking it's an easy place. \n\nI'm 22. I had a relatively gentle wake-up call, and I'm still kinda drowning. Maybe drowning is the wrong word. Struggling? I'm so, so fortunate to have middle-class parents who believe in supporting me.

I'd have had a much harsher introduction to the real world, and I'm not sure I would have been able to make it. \n\nOP, Nevermind the degree and better job opportunities that come with it.

Find/maintain/renew car registration and insurance? Do your taxes? Cook healthy, balancee meals? Be capable of basic car and house maintenance? Do chores? Navigate the complicated world of health care, including health insurance? Do you know how to get access to health insurance? \n\nYour dad is offering you an INCREDIBLE gift. And if you think partying is more important than having a future, let alone TAKING CARE OF YOUR KID... you're not mature enough to get married, let alone have a baby. \n\nWAKE. UP. DUDE!  \n\nYou're a parent now. You don't get to be a kid or young adult, free to do what you want, when you want. \n\nYes, YWBTA if you tell this to your dad. You'll also be incredibly, incredibly stupid. Apologize, make up, and accept his offer. Your dad loves you immensely and you're too blind to see it.

That means this is only going to take 3 years.\n\nIf the ages are right, your father was a teen parent himself. He know how hard it was. He may be cold, but he obviously cares for you and wants you to have a better start.", "I just want to put a few things in perspective for you: \n\nFirst of all, you have no degree. You mentioned nothing about any sort of trade or licensure so I\u2019m assuming you will need a job making minimum wage. No idea where you\u2019re located, but a quick google search says the highest minimum wage is 16.50 an hour. So assuming you work 40 hours a week, that\u2019s about $2,640 a month. Before taxes. Your baby will also need health insurance and so will you. Since you obviously don\u2019t realize or care to learn, health insurance is ridiculously expensive and you don\u2019t know that because you\u2019re likely on your dads plan and he pays for that. Health insurance is taken out of your weekly check. Next up, we have of course diapers. Average is $80 a month. Next we have how you\u2019ll feed your baby. If your girlfriend plans to breastfeed, that\u2019s great. But guess what? It\u2019s not easy. And sometimes for reasons beyond moms control, she can\u2019t breastfeed. For example, my baby has a milk protein allergy. Common in babies. So she requires hypoallergenic formula. One 32 oz bottle of formula gives us 8 bottles. That\u2019s gone easily in a 24 hour period. It is $70 a week to feed her. She also has bad GERD. She takes Pepcid twice a day. So each month I need to pick up and pay for her prescription. Depending on what insurance you have is what it will cost you each month. If you don\u2019t want to live with him, you\u2019ll need an apartment. No idea about where you live, but rent is outrageous right now. Then you need to pay for electricity every month, wifi, renters insurance, etc. you will need to furnish your apartment. You need to buy groceries weekly. You need gas in your car. You need to pay for car insurance. And you need to have money for unexpected emergencies. I do not see a world where you will ever be able to afford a baby and a life without your dads help at the moment. You need to finish your degree and you need to take this opportunity to save for you and your baby. If single moms can finish school with a baby, there\u2019s zero reason why you can\u2019t finish with all the help your dad is offering. If you so unintelligently choose to not except this help from your father you will regret it.\n\nI just don\u2019t think you realize how much your life is about to change. You are only 19. I would seriously consider terminating this pregnancy. You want to party and see friends. That is fine, you are 19, that is what you should want to do. But you can not have both.\n\nI love my daughter very much. My boyfriend and I live a comfortable lifestyle with good jobs and I am very grateful. However, I\u2019m 25. She was not planned. If you told me I would be guaranteed the same baby at 30 if I just waited, I would take that option in a heartbeat. Not because I don\u2019t love her, but because I just wasn\u2019t ready. I wasn\u2019t done wanting to go out and live my life. You can\u2019t do those things with a baby.  Just please consider your options and if you decide to go through with the pregnancy, please live with your dad. It will only benefit you.", "YTA.

Comparing yourself by how you look to your father is just showing how much growing up you still have to do.  Nor is it really your biggest problem and responsibility.

My 18gf got pregnant, she got kicked out. She temporarily moved in with her uncle. We plan to get married. I'm planning on getting a job meaning I have fo quit uni for me.\n\nThat's when my dad 37m found out he was outraged. He's very strict. He called me an idiot not attending uni and that I was delusional to think I could support a family when I have no job or degree whilst trying to be new parents. He then made an offer. He would turn his study into a bedroom for the baby, me and my Gf would move into my room. He said I will finish my degree and he will handle everything else. Whilst I'm at uni my mum will stay home with the baby. He also paying for gf's uni. But he said this means we will have more chores at home and the household rules will be applied to both of us. I refused. My mum called and told us that they were in similar situation with me and that they know its hard to support a family. She also called me insensitive since my dad is taking on extra hours at work in preparation for our baby arrival and even cancelled his gym membership. I hung up.\n\nHowever he said that I will only be allowed to go outside the house for uni. Said any time not spent towards uni will be given to my son. Meaning no friends/parties. My friends also enlightened me to the way my future son won't see me as an authority figure. As my dad would be the bigger/stronger man as well as my son would see me obey a more dominant man so will lose respect for me as well as I won't be a provider. \n\nMy dad always made me feel insecure (he's 6'4 and very muscular with better skin, hair and has better facial features), whenever he's near me I feel small and ugly due to the size comparison/looks. He tried to get me to workout with him but he lifted like 3x the amount I did in our sessions to the point it was humiliating so I decided to stop. All my friends were taller/stronger than their balding aging dads. He likes to walk around the house shirtless, flex whenever he see's a mirror or at random times such as a random pec bounce to make my younger bro laugh. And most of his clothes are very tight. This just reinforces my insecurity. Its gotten to the point I don't even want to be in the same room as him to avoid comparing myself to him.\n\nHe told my Gf and now we are both arguing over it. She said she'll gladly take on some extra chores and rules for what he's offering. But I was more mad at him for telling my gf so I went to stay at my grandparents house to cool off. \n\nMy Gf says I should take the offer and apologise. She also spoke about it to my dad who has agreed to wear baggy clothes in the house if it makes me feel better. That made me even more mad cause now they were discussing me behind my back. I'm considering declining his offer and telling him to stop interfering with our lives. I might be the AH cause my GF really wants this and it does sound like a good offer but his rules are unfair.\n\nWIBTA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. \n\nDoes your dad want to adopt me?", "Wow! YTA. The amount of time you would need to do this is so short compared to the benefits for the rest of your lives! Oh, you can\u2019t go out and party and hang with your friends because you have a wife and baby??? Boo hoo! Your dad and mom are trying to show you how to be responsible while ensuring your future. You are entirely missing the big picture. You and your girlfriend should put them on a pedestal and kiss their feet.", "YTA and also very stu..d, the offer it\u2019s excellent and you are throwing that away just because you feel insecure about your dad??", "In the nicest way possible:  You are a child.  You are too young and waaaay to immature to have this child. If you still wish to keep it then you\u2019d be an idiot not to take this offer.  Your gf knows this. Its time you do too. And btw, you have some serious serious incel issues you need to work out. Your gf will 100% leave you over them if you don\u2019t get help. Heck, she\u2019ll leave for sure if you don\u2019t take the offer.  YTA.\n\nAnd ps, you will have no life outside of that child for a long time. Get used to it and get your life on track.", "YTA\n\nSo you'd trust the opinion on child raising on a bunch of other teenager's opinions with no life experience over your dad who already travelled the course of young parenthood and who is prepared to help support you through it because you won't get to go to parties?\n\nYou're about to become a dad. You don't get to have the usual young adult party multiple times a week phase because you've jumped straight ahead to parenthood. You've got responsibilities now. You won't have even a quarter of the time available that you have now for socialising - and you need to make peace with that.", "Cutting off your nose to spite your face. Decisions you will come to badly regret. \n\nNTA if this is truly what you want - your dad out of your life, to quit school, attempt to find a job that will support you, your gf and the baby. You can't even afford rent.", "YTA. Buddy, you\u2019re gonna be a dad. And that means you need to grow the fuck up. You aren\u2019t gonna have time or money to party. You\u2019re being handed a sweet deal on a silver platter\u2026you cannot imagine how hard your life is gonna be without this.", "YTA\n\nListen, I think it's obvious you haven't truly been on your own yet. But if you think that living and doing chores with your parents is easier than doing EVERYTHING yourself, you're wrong. If you actually care about your future wife and child, you'd realize that they'll be better off if you finish your degree, get a good job, and take time to really get on your feet. Your dad is offering a free place to live and is going to pay for your education. If you're concerned about your child not seeing you as the father, maybe be less worried about partying and more worried about spending time raising your child? We aren't animals. There is no such thing as alpha humans.", "YTA. Now that you\u2019re having a kid, the kids best interests and well-being come before your own and your own desires. Partying and hanging out with friends whenever you choose went out the window once your child came into the picture. You seem way too focused on your own desires and on being a \u201cdominant\u201d male when you should be focussing on how to be a good parent. Put your child\u2019s best interests ahead of your own and accept your family\u2019s offer of opportunity for you and a stable safe home for your child.", "YTA. You need to put your ego aside and wake the fuck up dude. You are going to be a father and need to be able to support your family so finish your degree and let your Dad help you out. Get your priorities straight, your baby and fianc\u00e9e are going to need you", "YTA and a selfish one at that. Do you have any idea how much you\u2019re going to have to work to support the three of you, at very least while she\u2019s recovering. Child care costs are insane. When exactly do you think you\u2019re going to have time for friends and parties with a baby and working full time or more? And let\u2019s say you get the time, will you be able to afford a sitter? \n\nIs your ego so fragile that you\u2019d rather risk your child\u2019s, girlfriend\u2019s and your well-being and future? Is your insecurity and fear that great? Your ego and insecurity are the problem, not your father. \n\nDo what you need to do for them, that\u2019s what will make your child look up to you, not by throwing away opportunities and further stressing yourself and the mother.", "YTA. Lmao you realize that that by refusing your dads offer, you\u2019ll have to work and live alone with your girlfriend, which means you\u2019re gonna have to take on chores regardless on top of working and taking care of baby. \nDon\u2019t drop out if uni. You\u2019re clearly not the smartest person", "YTA. You\u2019re declining this extremely generous offer- that your parents are sacrificing to give you, your gf and your CHILD- because you want to go to parties and be the Alpha Male in the house??  You\u2019re not ready for a kid because you still are one. I hope your gf and baby can stay with your parents even if you don\u2019t.", "Come on bro. Man up, get your shit done, and take care of that family when you get finish.  Also, go to the fucking gym.", "YTA. Wow! Your parents are offering you a life line. Your girlfriend obviously realizes how precarious your situation is. She is looking at the big picture and trying to be level headed. Your \"feelings\" are more important than free uni, and free room and board and child care? You sound like a petulant, selfish child.", "I think you need to put the needs of your wife and child ahead of your insecurities. Get therapy to work on your self esteem. Stop expecting your father to be less so you can feel like more. Your *baby* isn't going to respect your dad for being more \"dominant\", he's a *baby.*\n\nBefore you turn down your parents offer, please start applying for jobs. See what you can get. What kind of money you are going to be making. Then make a budget. See what kind of accommodations you can afford. Look at the price of diapers and formula. See how much you'll need to spend on food for you and your girlfriend. Don't forget electricity, water, and transportation costs. \n\nNow consider how hard it is going to be to get promoted without college. So this is it for the rest of your life. Compare that to having built in babysitters that are actively helping you to get qualified for a good job.\n\nIs it humiliating? Maybe. That depends how you take it. But if you can stay focused you can be launched into a good life. Not just for you but for your wife. When your kid is old enough to start forming memories, he's going to remember a dad who was there for him and has a good job instead of a dad who is never home because he is working 3 jobs and is too tired to play catch. Take the help and stay focused on what you need to do to advance.", "YTA\u2026. Seriously you have other issues going on here. You are immature and insecure. When you become a dad you don\u2019t have time for social life and night life\u2026. I\u2019m sorry but not sure you are ready to be a dad.", "YTA. Dude, really?? I hope you gf at least takes the offer and you can do whatever if you want to be that stubborn. Start thinking about your child and gf not yourself. You can\u2019t afford anything because you don\u2019t have a job. Stop being immature and grow up.", "Can I meet your dad?", "YTA.... All of it sounds like a you problem, not any issue with your father.", "YTA", "YTA.\nBeing a parent is a fulltime job and your dad is giving you the chance to finish your education. When you're a parent living on your own you genuinely have A LOT less time out with your friends. I think he's being pretty reasonable. Trust me dude you want to finish school, I'm having to support my kid on my own and attempt to go to school.", "YTA - this isn\u2019t about you or your insecurities. It\u2019s about your dad thinking about your future and that of your child and gf take the help. This economy without a job and career is brutal!", "[removed]", "YTA\n\nYou need to put aside your pride and insecurities and consider what will be best for your son in the long term. I do not have a degree. It is very very hard in this day and age to support just myself and my pets, let alone a baby and partner. Despite what you feel for your dad he is offering you and your girlfriend a ticket to an opportunity to be the best parents and providers and you ought to take it. It\u2019s okay to accept help and it does not make you less of a man. You absolutely should take your parents up on this, it\u2019s an incredibly generous offer.", "A lot of people would kill for that amount of support and opportunity. You may want to look into therapy to deal with your insecurities. Grow up take the offer YTA.", "YTA \n\nI'm really concerned for your future child. You mentioned in a comment you want your kid to have a great childhood, but you're already putting your wants - not needs, wants - ahead of your baby's well-being. \n\nI do not think you have to go to uni to get a good job, but your dad is offering you a REALLY good deal here. The rules you mentioned are for the most part pretty common for parents to have with their children. And let's face it, you still are absolutely a child. Most 19 year olds aren't that isn't a personal dig. \n\nHave you tried discussing the household rules with your father and maybe coming to a compromise? We have unofficial assigned seats at my house too, and I'm middle aged. It's not a demand, more of habit. Is it possible that your dad is just more particular about things like that, and it isn't necessarily a rule?\n\nThe only one that sounds particularly strict like others have said is to let your dad know every time you're coming/going. Maybe you two can discuss why that's important and what the reasoning behind it is. Is it driven by you having gotten your gf pregnant? Is he paranoid about safety? \n\nRegardless of the reason, a good compromise could be: I'll let you know when I'm going out, about what time I think I'll be home and if I'll be more than x minutes late. That's a courtesy to any family member who may be worried about you. \n\nHonestly a lot of these rules are going to happen naturally because in that instance, you're all going to have to coordinate care for the baby. \n\nA lot of your insecurities have absolutely 0 to do with the baby or the household rules. You just seem to have a jealous tendency towards your dad. Aside from recommending therapy, which I cannot stress enough you should start going to - parenting is going to be stressful. Why not go to the gym on your own or with friends?\n\nYour child will absolutely not care how big and strong you are or look. They'll care how you love them, and that cannot be decided by muscles or gym time. \n\nI think it's great you want your kid to have an amazing childhood, but to do that, quite honestly OP, you have to stop thinking so selfishly. Everything you talked about is how you feel, not what would be best for the child. \n\nYou also have to hear your girlfriend out because she is your partner in this. \n\nYour alternative, as you know, is to move out and pay for things on your own. I can guarantee you that will be a lot more stressful than worrying what fit of shirt your father is wearing. \n\nAt the very least, please look at budgeting pros vs cons of living with your family vs on your own and how much money you would need to make to do each. Don't forget costs like diapers, formula, medical insurance and co-pays, emergency funds, food for both you and your girlfriend, utilities, rent, gas or transportation costs, phone bill, internet, university costs for whoever is going, child care costs if you both are unavailable, day care if you're working and gf is at school, and a whole bunch of others I can't think of off the top of my head. \n\nWhile it sucks to not make your own rules, I think if you remove emotions and look at your options purely from a logical perspective, you'll have a pretty clear cut answer as to what you should do. \n\nBest of luck to all of you.", "[removed]", "YTA. Finish college and let your gf finish college and then leave. Not finishing is a mistake. Take it from a single mom who had her son at 21 and is still struggling to finish school at 32 and have had nothing but poverty.", "You are too immature to be having a baby.  Not even just because of your age but how you speak.  You are clearly jealous of your father.

Life is full of rules you aren\u2019t going to like.  Working minimum wage is ridiculously tough.  I know from personal experience from when I was your age but I didn\u2019t have a kid on the way or any family support.  I struggled for a VERY long time.  You will regret not getting a college degree.  You will have NO time or money for friends if you and your girlfriend try to live on your own on just your minimum wage job.  You won\u2019t have money for parties either.  Your girlfriend will have to get a job immediately and daycare is insanely expensive.

If you\u2019re both college educated you can provide so much more for your kid, that should be priority. \n\nAlso the rules sound completely normal to me, you can\u2019t just come and go as you please or drink when you have a kid no matter where you\u2019re living. Even if it was just you and gf living together you can\u2019t drink when she\u2019s giving birth soon because you need to be available to drive to hospital and you shouldn\u2019t get drunk with a small child around you have to take care of.

You're a kid having a kid and that's a scary and stressful thing. The worries about your child seeing your dad as an authority figure over you isn't really how kids see their parents. Not the little ones at least. When you have your kid they will see you as the big strong man. Not because of your physical strength and size but because you're their dad. It's just different. When these babies come into the world they don't care how much you can bench press they care that you are there for them. When you talk to your GFs belly they will learn your voice, when you have that newborn on your chest they will know your smell and will depend on you to care for them and protect them. All the diaper changes, the rocking to sleep, the tickle fights, the bath times, the comforting them when they are sick and reading to them will be what sets you apart from others. That's what'll make you the man. That's what'll make you a dad. \n\nI think the offer your father gave you is a very generous offer and I think this may be the first big decision you make in your journey to becoming a mature adult and a parent. Part of being a parent is making sacrifices. It sounds like sacrificing your comfort for a couple of years (yes I know years feel so long now but they'll sprint by as you get older, trust me) in favor of your child and your family having a secure and stable environment to grow and develop in is a very big and very noble sacrifice. That would make you a man. You would be growing up and putting your families collective needs above your own singular needs and wants. \n\nMy suggestion is this.\n\nSit down with your girlfriend and write up some compromises. Set out a schedule that gives each of you some down time each day. My husband and I have it set up that he handles Morning routine (and his chores) and I handle the night routine (and my chores). That means for an hour or 2 you can do what you want- Game, sleep in, what have you. Then, pick one meal you all can have as the family time meal. Our meal in my family is lunch. Once you get this all down pick a day once a month for a date night that'll work for both of your uni schedules. When you are done sit down with your dad and ask for a compromise. Lay out your wishes and see if there's an agreeable middle ground you both can work to. One of the most mature things you could ever do is learn to compromise. \n\nATM it seems that you are viewing your dad's rules as a child in the house but you should try to step back and view it as an adult setting boundaries. \n\nGrowing and nurturing your family as a soon to be father and a husband will work a lot better when you have help. Adult's know when to accept and ask for help. It's okay to ask for help. You can't do it all and that's 100% okay. I know this can be scary but the best choice you can make is what's best for your family as a whole not you as an individual. Congratulations on the baby by the way. I wish a safe delivery and a healthy baby to your family!", "I hope this is bait because of the insecurity bit. Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth.

This will ALLOW you to get your degree, get skills, get experience, and provide a better life for your kid. \n\nMy parents had my kids while I was deployed overseas.

Do the needful. It's not about you anymore, drop the ego. Don't care if you feel insecure, just wait til your kid shoves two Legos up it's nose on your watch and needs to go to the ER.

Unless you rob a bank or win a lottery you got no leverage here. \n\nThose seem to be your two options. You got the golden ticket here and you're too insecure and naive to not take this offer. Again talk to your dad to see if he's willing to compromise before you jump the gun.", "You say that you want to thank him for the incredibly generous and loving offer. \n\nYou say you can\u2019t believe you were not able to thank him immediately, you are a bit overwhelmed with how much is changing, and you were being foolish. \n\nYou and your girlfriend are so grateful for the love and support he and your mother offer, and your family would be grateful to get to spend your first few years together living with your parents. \n\nYou say that you and girlfriend will devote your lives to your child, your educations, building your family life together, while being contributing members of the household. \n\nThank you Dad, your generosity means the world to us, I love you.", "Fair enough. I take that part back then. Then I\u2019m wondering which way you will go. In real talk though, so you have a trusted mentor you can talk to? Not your mates the same age, but maybe someone older who\u2019s seen some shit who can give you some advice? Your friends are too close to it, they probably have their own parent problems to deal with so they are projecting. And sadly too young to really think through all the consequences. Your GF is nesting, she\u2019s think about life with a baby inside of her and what\u2019s she\u2019s going to do with or without you. Like a coach, teacher, cool friend of the family? Because Reddit can jump on you, but a discussion with someone you trust might really help.", "Plus it not like some things can't be negotiated. Like if OP does his chores and does well in university and builds enough good will, his parents might be willing to bend for the odd party here and there. \n\nPlus he could convince them to allow him to join one club here and there or to babysit for an internship given these activities can look good on a resume.", "it's legit incel speak that he's going to be using around their child. Newsflash OP, your father deserves your child's respect and there isn't a finite amount so cool it and allow your life to be made easier after you decided at 19 years of life that you could be a parent.", "He should be glad his child will have a role model to look up to because he certainly doesn't sound like he is willing to be one.", "I had a good giggle at the comment of no friend/no parties if they move in. You\u2019ll have a newborn, the only parties in your future OP are little kids birthday parties \ud83e\udd23", "Exactly, I guess that he thinks that people with newborns party every weekend \ud83d\ude44", "I also use sweet baby kitten Jesus. I do a lot of things in relation of cats/kittens cuz I do have a tendency to swear a lot so I try to replace it when I\u2019m at work/college lol. I do a lot of weird sayings tbh then at home I swear more then lol", "Yeah OPs dad started at a very young age the other dads ars probably in their 50s whilst OPs dad is still young not even 40. Combined with the fact he works out more and does woodworking its no wonder he's built and bigger than OP. Plus if OPs mum is small than there was little chance he would grow taller than his dad anyways. Just makes sense", "To be honest with big decisions like this my dads always been my confidant. Don't really trust anyone else except my mum and she's on my dads side.", "Your child won't have a good childhood regardless if you are that insecure. You're going to weird them the fuck out by being that creepy father that feels like they *have* to be their hero, instead of giving them a reason for the child to look up to them.\n\nRespectfully, you are not ready to be a father. Not even remotely close. Get your act together, time is running out.", "And look at how your dad being bigger and stronger makes you feel.  He\u2019s not even doing anything; his mere existence makes you feel less than.  Why would you want to be that for your kid?  On top of the whole having a kid, you\u2019ve got some serious emotional issues you need to handle.  \n\nHell, I\u2019m 43.  Got married and had a kid without finishing school. Can I take your place in his home and go to college if you don\u2019t want it?", "That\u2019s\u2026just sad. Weird and sad.", "You just went on a rant about how horrible you found your father's upbringing and that him being fit gave you a complex, but you want to do the exact same for your son?\n\nDude, you're being incredibly childish. You have to take responsibility for a small human now. A degree will give you lots more opportunities. The room at your dad's will be a massive help...\n\nYou don't like chores? If you live alone, you'll have to do all of them anyway. Don't like your father being in your children's life? Raising him alone will be a lot harder. You want to party? Well, that's not your life anymore.\n\nYou're still a teen. I know this is not what you want to hear, but you are literally still a child yourself. Your brain won't be finished growing for another 25 years. Please get into therapy to handle your insecurities about your dad. Otherwise, you'll be insecure for the rest of your life.", "I would encourage the father to be more open to OP joining a club here and there and maybe if OP decides to do an internship since these types of activities can look good on a resume when looking for work in the future.", "If they can find a babysitter for their kid to go to the odd party, that wouldn't a be a problem. The child should still come first though.", "Kid is 19, plenty of people get inches taller around that age", "That fact that his dad even needed to include number 11 on the list concerns me.", "Depends on the height difference. If its massive a few inches won't help his inferiority complex. I personally never cared about my dads height or weight.", "It sounds like the girlfriend is taking the deal no matter what OP decides. I\u2019d live as a virtual prisoner for free education, childcare and room & food", "Yes, unless he only eats chicken nuggets and fries. I\u2019ve known people like that. One young woman lived on funions and sour patch kids", "It's such a good deal. That education means the parents have better job options and it sets the family up for life. \n\nThis guy has no clue about the utter struggle of trying to get by on a single salary for an entire family. It doesn't sound like he has any specific skills so he's looking at minimum wage drudgery for the rest of his life \n\nAnd he wants to pick that because his dad is taller than him or some thing?", "Plus they can negotiate. Joining a club or doing an internship are things that look good on resumes so there could be some flexibility on those things.", "Only has to live there until graduation and finds a good job", "Yeah, like even if it's not ideal, it's a helluva lot better than staring down a lifetime of poverty struggles.\n\nNot saying education is the only ticket to success, but 4 years of rent and food and childcare? In exchange for chores? I'd be scrubbing like crazy. Might even learn to iron."]}
