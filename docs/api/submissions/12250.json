His issue is disinterest in involvement or perhaps taking advantage of his wife for all parenting responsibility. She shouldnt have to remind him of every little thing because thats not support its enabling bad behavior. If she broke down and needed a wallet that would be a one time fluke. Also you can likely get a ride from the tow company and swing by your house to get your wallet. Or venmo/PayPal money in your example."]}
