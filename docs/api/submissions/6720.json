But no sale. Over a year later, we are married and his home is sitting there empty - not for sale or even rent in the meantime. \n\nWe opened up a joint account (my request) because I wanted to put all our income together and put both houses in both our names. I\u2019ve always talked about this, but he has stalled in ever reciprocating any agreement, and changes subject.\nHe is refusing to put all our income together or houses in our names, because \u201cwhat if we one day get a divorce\u201d, he wants to own his home by himself, and \u201cwon\u2019t have a home to go to\u201d and he will only use the joint account for us to equally put enough money into it each month to pay the new house bills (mortgage, electric, water, cable etc\u2026) \n\nOne night we were casually discussing this with a friend of ours, and he let us know that now my husband can basically own a piece of my home if we were ever to divorce, since we pay for everything through the joint marital account and since he even helped renovate one thing - outdoor shower project\u2026 so whatever money he put into upgrades in the future and what we pay through joint marital account\u2026 Will give him some percent legal interest according to our friend.\nAnd jokingly told him, nice move man! \n\nLater, I told my husband it\u2019s not fair that he now will have a legal interest in my home since we now pay for half of of my home\u2019s bills (what should by now be both of our house legally if he had agreed to put both homes in our names) through a joint marital account, while also 100% owning his home, and it wasn\u2019t fair that he went back on his word of selling his home. \n\nI told him until he was ready to put our money together, and put both homes in our names, and make good on his promise, we should not have a joint account that would only benefit him if something were to happen to us. I closed it down and gave him my banking details to pay rent to me each month and attached a lease that I asked him to sign so legally his payments are rent and anything additional is considered a gift.

You're responding by formalizing an agreement that, while protecting yourself in a fair manner, solidifies the reason for his fear: this is my house, you just live here.\n\nIt all boils down to him not trusting in your marriage enough to commit to jointly owning the house, to thinking of it as our house instead of as your house.

Right now, the fact that you are paying PMI and will need approximately 1/8 of the cost of your husbands home money to clear it tells me that your house is a very recent purchase.

This will protect you both!", "Yeah, it sounds like he's got one foot out of the door already.", "Well then I guess it\u2019s a good thing that was never our agreement lol\nAgreement was to sell his house, and put a small amount of the proceeds, into mine to remove PMi, or alternatively if he wanted to put more, that would be his decision. Home is almost at 20% due to my putting in additional principal each month.", "It sounds like your instincts were right. He\u2019s still not committed to you.", "a thousand percent. people get caught up by/constantly miss the nuance between \"protecting self\" and \"protecting self [at expense of someone else]\"\n\nhis need for protection? important, valid, all g. the inbalance that pushes toward the partner that he should view and treat as an equal - who has equal right to protection - is whats not great.", "Can you read that as if your friend or sister is telling you that this? Her husband won\u2019t keep going to counselling, even though it helped, because he doesn\u2019t like being called out. \n\nFYI if you like that counsellor, you can probably go back to her by yourself. You really seem to have some unhealthy patterns in your relationship. Even though it takes two people to turn an unhealthy relationship into a healthy one, sometimes one person getting insight and making changes is enough to change the direction a relationship is going in.", "I get what you're saying but it was his suggestion to move into her house knowing it still had a mortgage. They could've moved into his and she could've rented hers out. He told her he would sell his house. She was banking on a partnership and a life. He was planning a divorce. I don't know if I agree that he's 'paying' for her house. He's paying because he lives there. Just like any renter would. He should've been a man and told her how he felt and let her decide. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't have wanted a joint anything. That friend is a whole jerk but I would be grateful for the knowledge so I could correct the mistake."]}
