But no sale. Over a year later, we are married and his home is sitting there empty - not for sale or even rent in the meantime. \n\nWe opened up a joint account (my request) because I wanted to put all our income together and put both houses in both our names. I\u2019ve always talked about this, but he has stalled in ever reciprocating any agreement, and changes subject.\nHe is refusing to put all our income together or houses in our names, because \u201cwhat if we one day get a divorce\u201d, he wants to own his home by himself, and \u201cwon\u2019t have a home to go to\u201d and he will only use the joint account for us to equally put enough money into it each month to pay the new house bills (mortgage, electric, water, cable etc\u2026) \n\nOne night we were casually discussing this with a friend of ours, and he let us know that now my husband can basically own a piece of my home if we were ever to divorce, since we pay for everything through the joint marital account and since he even helped renovate one thing - outdoor shower project\u2026 so whatever money he put into upgrades in the future and what we pay through joint marital account\u2026 Will give him some percent legal interest according to our friend.\nAnd jokingly told him, nice move man! \n\nLater, I told my husband it\u2019s not fair that he now will have a legal interest in my home since we now pay for half of of my home\u2019s bills (what should by now be both of our house legally if he had agreed to put both homes in our names) through a joint marital account, while also 100% owning his home, and it wasn\u2019t fair that he went back on his word of selling his home. \n\nI told him until he was ready to put our money together, and put both homes in our names, and make good on his promise, we should not have a joint account that would only benefit him if something were to happen to us. I closed it down and gave him my banking details to pay rent to me each month and attached a lease that I asked him to sign so legally his payments are rent and anything additional is considered a gift.

You're responding by formalizing an agreement that, while protecting yourself in a fair manner, solidifies the reason for his fear: this is my house, you just live here.\n\nIt all boils down to him not trusting in your marriage enough to commit to jointly owning the house, to thinking of it as our house instead of as your house.

Right now, the fact that you are paying PMI and will need approximately 1/8 of the cost of your husbands home money to clear it tells me that your house is a very recent purchase.  Currently your house is not an asset but a huge debt. However, if your name goes on his house then you are getting a part of his asset.\n\nYou are right, it is not fair. You are worried about protecting your money in your home. You should not because, with a new house, your equity is minimal. What you want him to do is to sell away his asset to put into your debt.

Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.  Protecting your assets is a no duh.  You're an idiot if you don't, simple as that", "As a therapist whose clients needed to see her on their lunch break for $10 cash so that their abusive spouses wouldn\u2019t get suspicious due to having a joint account, should I tell them that in a healthy marriage finances should be joint?? Especially when their spouse did a great job keeping their abusive tendencies hidden until after they got married, or after they got pregnant? What about when they have to stay longer until they squirrel away enough money to leave?? Even if they healed from the abuse and got into a healthy relationship down the line, I don\u2019t think they\u2019d agree with your line of thinking.\n\nIt really boils down to preference. There are plenty of successful happy marriages where people intermingle finances and there are also happy marriages where the couple doesn\u2019t intermingle finances. Joining finances shouldn\u2019t be a goal post to strive for given the fact that plenty of unhealthy marriages have joint finances.", "There needs to be an r/thatsnotgaslighting", "Meh. You don't bully people into selling property as a condition of marriage either or help yourself to their assets because it would improve your credit rating.", "Sounds like he talked the talk, but once married, reneged.", " There's protecting assets and preparing for the worse and there's saying \"well if we get a divorce\" \n\nAgain, you expecting divorce...you shouldn't marry. Expect the worst all the time, and you become a self-fulfilling prophecy.", "> she took out PMI in order to be able to get it . . . this means she didn't have a \"deposit\" for it\n\nThis is wrong & misleading both to readers and anyone hoping to one day purchase a home in the US.\n\nPMI isn\u2019t required only when you put down no deposit. Most conventional lenders will require PMI if you purchase a home with *less than a 20% deposit.* From the minimal information we\u2019ve been given, there\u2019s absolutely no way to know or reason to say that she has \u201clittle to no, if not negative, equity\u201d in her home. In fact, that she\u2019s due to get rid of her PMI by the end of the year makes the opposite far more likely.", "So, what you're saying, is that he has a pattern of gaslighting pervasive enough to be pointed out by a therapist, but he hasn't had motivation to tackle it effectively? \n\nIf someone's consistently gaslighting you, you'll accumulate damage regardless of the other person's intent.\n\n For one, any issue that could be solved by effectively communicating and being level with eachother is made impossible, to a point where you start to doubt your own problem solving efforts and turn to strangers on the internet.\n\nMy other point is, that you'll learn bad habits, like breaking down and twisting your own boundaries to fit the other person.", "Actually it is gaslighting. People who gaslight can do it by several different means. They can gaslight you by questioning your authority, denying the evidence you have or doing everything they can to make you feel like you're wrong. In this case he\u2019s doing everything he can to convince her that his crappy behavior is her fault because she broke up with him previously because he wasn\u2019t willing to commit. Fast forward, he\u2019s using her valid reason for leaving previously as an excuse for his behavior( aka convincing her it\u2019s her fault he\u2019s like this because she left before). By definition, that IS gaslighting.", "I asked her this and she avoided the question of course, but what happens if he does sell his house and give her money from it, and they end up getting a divorce. Does he get a share of whatever value her house has (which doesn't sound like there is any at this point in time)? Or is it okay for him to be robbed out of that when a divorce happens? Personally, I agree with people here saying they should just get a post nup since neither of them trusts each other apparently.", "We are in a high cost of living area and were only able to put 10% down on our home. But our mortgage is hundreds less than rent we'd be paying in our area for a similar home.

In the same way that I want to drop 100lbs and every other resolution people make on January 1.\n\nShe even *states* that she might not be successful in this in another comment.", "He already gets a share of the value of her home because its considered that hes contributing to it, so if he leaves right now, he gets his house free and clear, as well as a portion, likely half, of her house. Thats why its an issue. He is holding all the cards. The cards should be shared in a marriage. Or he can sign her post nup and she can keep her house and he can keep his and they'll all be even.

Its not petty its smart.", "Maybe men are just starting to think about themselves and their best interests now. In my experience, every relationship I've ever been in, the women will always find a way to make everything their best interests. Perhaps men are getting tired of that and tired of always losing everything in divorces, and being selfish about it. It sounds like she manipulated him into getting married in the first place, and is now manipulating him into getting her way with the rent. Yet you only see him as manipulative. Maybe he's being smart. Maybe he realizes that majority of marriages end in divorce and is being smart about his best outcome. In today's world, I don't blame him.", ">Maybe men are just starting to think about themselves and their best interests now\n\nNow??? What world do you live in that men haven't always put their best interests first? \n\nI really wish you just would've started out with \"I'm a misogynist\" so I wouldn't have wasted any time on you."]}
