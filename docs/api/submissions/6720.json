But no sale. Over a year later, we are married and his home is sitting there empty - not for sale or even rent in the meantime. \n\nWe opened up a joint account (my request) because I wanted to put all our income together and put both houses in both our names. I\u2019ve always talked about this, but he has stalled in ever reciprocating any agreement, and changes subject.\nHe is refusing to put all our income together or houses in our names, because \u201cwhat if we one day get a divorce\u201d, he wants to own his home by himself, and \u201cwon\u2019t have a home to go to\u201d and he will only use the joint account for us to equally put enough money into it each month to pay the new house bills (mortgage, electric, water, cable etc\u2026) \n\nOne night we were casually discussing this with a friend of ours, and he let us know that now my husband can basically own a piece of my home if we were ever to divorce, since we pay for everything through the joint marital account and since he even helped renovate one thing - outdoor shower project\u2026 so whatever money he put into upgrades in the future and what we pay through joint marital account\u2026 Will give him some percent legal interest according to our friend.\nAnd jokingly told him, nice move man! \n\nLater, I told my husband it\u2019s not fair that he now will have a legal interest in my home since we now pay for half of of my home\u2019s bills (what should by now be both of our house legally if he had agreed to put both homes in our names) through a joint marital account, while also 100% owning his home, and it wasn\u2019t fair that he went back on his word of selling his home. \n\nI told him until he was ready to put our money together, and put both homes in our names, and make good on his promise, we should not have a joint account that would only benefit him if something were to happen to us. I closed it down and gave him my banking details to pay rent to me each month and attached a lease that I asked him to sign so legally his payments are rent and anything additional is considered a gift.

You're responding by formalizing an agreement that, while protecting yourself in a fair manner, solidifies the reason for his fear: this is my house, you just live here.\n\nIt all boils down to him not trusting in your marriage enough to commit to jointly owning the house, to thinking of it as our house instead of as your house.

Nothing wrong with him protecting his assets.\n\nYour big misconception here is believing that because your house is twice as expensive as his, you are in a better financial position. You are most certainly not. He owns his home outright, does not matter if it is half the price of yours, if he sells it he will get all the proceeds of the sale. If you sell yours I doubt that you would get back any money since you would have to repay the bulk of your loan. Cost in this instance in the present does not equal value. It will of course change the longer you are together.\n\nYou are hung up on him putting his name on your house. Were I him, I would not because that would be assuming your debt. Right now, the fact that you are paying PMI and will need approximately 1/8 of the cost of your husbands home money to clear it tells me that your house is a very recent purchase.  Currently your house is not an asset but a huge debt. However, if your name goes on his house then you are getting a part of his asset.\n\nYou are right, it is not fair. You are worried about protecting your money in your home. You should not because, with a new house, your equity is minimal. What you want him to do is to sell away his asset to put into your debt. To help you out.  And you are wondering why he does not want to do that... A reason could be that you have broken up with him before.\n\nIronically I think that what you have done is probably better for him in terms of unmerging the accounts. But someone more familiar with divorce can clarify this.", "ESH. As someone who got screwed over in a divorce, I don\u2019t blame anyone who protects their own interests. I will never let anyone have a say in my house again and would get a pre-nup to that effect. Doesn\u2019t mean I think I\u2019d get divorced again, but I\u2019m certainly not going to risk it. You should be protecting your own interests too. Get a post nup done ASAP.", "NTA. Your husband's refusal to put his house on the market after agreeing to do so, during a housing boom, no less, is a red flag. He's looking out for his own interests without any consideration for you whatsoever.\n\nSee an attorney immediately to find out what you need to do to protect yourself financially.", "NTA, you need to protect yourself, he has one foot out the door.", "NTA.  I don't think your husband is wrong for wanting a safety net.  My spouse and I have a joint account but also personal savings accounts.  It was something I insisted on when we got married -- I saw my mother financially controlled by my father and no matter how much I love my spouse, I'll never put myself in the same position.\n\nInititally my spouse didn't like it, but I suggested they do the same.  I still don't think my spouse is thrilled by it, but has largely come to understand that it was a non-negotiable for me.\n\nYour husband is definitely the asshole for lying to you and for creating a situation where only he benefits.", "NTA.

Women have been increasingly advised to have secret savings in case they need to leave their husbands, which made sense in \u201ctraditional\u201d marriages where the husband is the breadwinner and the wife stays home, but doesn\u2019t for modern and equitable marriages. But he has reneged on promises and plans, because it benefits him.\n\nPostnuptial agreements aren\u2019t just for the rich, you should look into it. It would benefit and protect you both, so that your husband wouldn\u2019t have to be shady about protecting himself.", "NTA, your husband is taking advantage of you. Check this but if you live with your spouse in the same home for at least 5 continous years of the marriage, the other party will get some rights (by Spanish law)", "NAH honestly the only bad thing he did was going against what he said what he has done seems fine but I would just get him to sign a agreement that your house is yours and his house is his in the event of divorce he is kinda stupid for not renting it out as an airbnb he could be making alot of money off of it honestly in this age having a plan for divorce is nothing to worry about just a good idea", "Wow, it\u2019s barely been a year, he reneged on your financial plans, made divorce plans with no prenup because he organized it where HE benefits and you lose\u2026\n\n\u2026yikes.\n\nTalk to a lawyer about a post nuptial agreement, it sounds like you DO need to protect yourself.\n\nNTA", "NTA, it doesn't sound like he's counting on this relationship to work out.", "NTA - your husband didn't combine everything and become your life partner, so it is a good idea to want to separate things. this is his fault for not keeping his word. Maybe just tell him to go live in his other house until he sells it and keeps his original promise.", "NAH. You state that you\u2019ve broken up with him before so I am wondering if hubby is keeping his place not because he is planning a divorce but because he fears YOU will divorce HIM. If so, while not healthy, I can understand where his insecurity is coming from.\n\nOTH you suck because you\u2019re viewing this as a transactional relationship and that\u2019s not healthy either. Your fears are that he\u2019s using you.\n\nI think the two of you would benefit from so  couples therapy to figure out why these power dynamics are occurring and what are the underlying issues.", "IMO thats why prenups should be done before getting married.", ">Why else would he say he won't \"have a home to go to\"? \n\nI would venture that she isn't solvent and will likely lose this house unless he puts in the money to help her.\n\nThen neither of them have a home whether they divorce or not.", "Bad things happen all the time its called having insurance not planing for it but having a plan in case is  never bad imo", "Hearing your bitterness towards this guy really makes me happy I'm staying single and doing the rest of my life on my own \ud83d\ude02", "Wait so you\u2019re saying your husband doesn\u2019t contribute to the mortgage payment (or at all financially to house) or he pays other house bills? It\u2019s same here in my state, that what we had pre marriage is ours, except our friend is right, now that we\u2019re splitting all my house bills he is entitled to some percentage of the home. \nFunny I finished the backyard remodel too (pool, travertine, horizontal wood fence) before my husband moved in \nI don\u2019t want to do separate accounts at all, quite the opposite, but fee I have no choice", "This is so important! Do you have an FHA loan? Think it\u2019s pretty crappy you can never remove pmi in that scenario.\n\nOur mortgage company does remove PMI either after 20% paid, after their approved renovations cover appreciation, or after two years mortgage payments if property went up. I\u2019m on a lake and it went up really high so in about 6 months I could apply for a new appraisal and apply for  PMI removal as well, Just with the market in 6 months there\u2019s no guarantee I succeed in the process that way.\n\nHe\u2019s committed, I know it sounds opposite. I know he is.  But he has always been a fear based decision maker, which also consequently leads to years of indecision. It\u2019s no fun but his other qualities are way more important", "No, shes not sort of doing the same thing. He told her he was going to do XYZ and she entered the marriage with that in mind. Hes now refusing to do XYZ and shes having to figure out how to protect herself.", ">He went back on his promise and is dragging his feet, which is sketchy. \n\nProbably because she's a liability financially and if this all goes wrong they lose two houses rather than just one. Irrespective of whether they divorce or not.", ">And it doesn't occur to him that half of his house would go to you as well as half of your house to him in event of divorce.\n\nHer house is, to all intents and purposes, worthless; as there is little to no equity in it.\n\nShe took out PMI because she couldn't afford a down payment and is likely struggling with her repayments as a result.\n\nHis house is paid off. She wants him to sell that and put the money into her house, which could still be foreclosed on.\n\nThat's a risky strategy even if they don't divorce.\n\nThe better compromise is that she abandons this endeavour with her house and goes to live with him. Then they can actually save money for an actual down payment on.\n\nI get the impression also that she is very much a \"her way or the highway\" kind of woman and so she's forcing a financially stupid situation as an ultimatum.\n\nIt's got very little to do with him planning for divorce and more her not really being financially stable.", "No fear that he\u2019s using me, i\u2019m being a little more petty than that - if he\u2019s going to protect himself, than I am too lol \nBut I also know him, this will light the fire under him", "NTA something is up that he is keeping his house vacant and not selling it.", "Get a postnuptial agreement drafted to protect both of you. Wanting to protect himself isn't bad by itself, but it needs to be fair to both of you.", "All those fears are fine.  Which just means those that have them aren't ready to get married.

He pays the rest of the bills. \n\nThis house has always been my forever home...I know he would never take it from me. Even with a joint account a judge will see it as him paying \"rent\" especially since he already owns a house free and clear. If you live in a sole & separate property state...you should be okay given the circumstance of both being home owners.\n\nI will say...my husband sold his house 8 months after our first date and asked me to marry him.

If he wasn\u2019t going to commit back then, then you had the right to break up and not waste any more of your time on someone who didn\u2019t want to commit to you.
