My mother never spoke to me like that and I can't imagine her ever doing so. It would make me never want to come to her with any issue again. When you're upset sometimes it can be hard to get full sentences out especially with anxiety when you don't fully have a grasp on it yourself. That's not a very good pattern and she's being very dismissive about yalls feelings.", "NTA, but your wife certainly is an flaming asshole. anxiety makes it hard to articulate thoughts and feelings during a panic attack. please sign your kid up for therapy, and some kind of family therapy to help your wife understand that's she's not being intelligent saying these things to someone having a panic attack.", "You are nta-your wife is and how she is talking to your child can have lifelong negative implications.  There is definitely something wrong with that!", "NTA\n\nYour wife sounds borderline abusive.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife doesn\u2019t sound like she knows how to effectively communicate. She\u2019s likely making this worse for your daughter.\n\nAs a mom, I\u2019d never talk to my teen like that.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife's insults are likely contributing to your daughter's anxiety. Instead of having circular conversations with your wife, you need to start stepping up (e.g. couples counseling) for her sake and yours.", "NTA, and in fact you do need to insert yourself MORE. I fully appreciate waiting until your daughter left the room, so you two can present a united front. BUT insulting your daughter is not a front you should be united on.\n\nYou should be standing up for your daughter during those conversations, if you have already discussed it and no changes have been made. Do not tolerate someone insulting your child! Not tolerating it doesn't mean you're 'too sensitive'.", "NTA \n\nIf your daughter is having trouble formulating sentences or is incredibly overwhelmed by school maybe see about getting her a therapist? Or a guidance counselor who could help her organize her thoughts and school activities? She will probably need one soon any ways with the way her mother talks to her. \n\nMake sure to keep standing up for your daughter, no child feels good when a parent talks down to them in such a mean way.", "ESH.  Why can't your daughter take a break from the activity?  Is the fact that it's causing her anxiety not reason enough?  There are certain hard things in life that are unavoidable (work, school, illness, etc.)  Extracurriculars don't have to be one of them.", "NTA\n\nyour wife is abusive. if you don't stand up for your daughter now, then you can both say goodbye forever when she moves out and goes no contact.\n\nAlso \"I hate when you talk to us like that\".\n\nShe insults you too?\n\nYour wife is sick in the head. Get help for your daughter.\n\nWhen a child tries to reach out to their parent for support and in turn gets insulted for poor sentence structure, then that parent is a complete and utter arse", "NTA at all. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just how moms talk to teens.\u201d Yeah sure, and some people in the world are starving, and global warming is happening. Just because something is true doesn\u2019t make it right.", "Your wife is the asshole - the kid has anxiety and she is then shamed for succumbing to it \n\nSounds like she\u2019s struggling - and needs extra support. Do you want a dead kid hanging in your closet? No? Take that wife to therapy \n\nAlso\u2026. check out ADHD. Your kid might have an undiagnosed mental condition or ADHD. \n\nShe\u2019s trying to articulate herself and should have a safe space to do that - if she needs a break give her some support before she gets worse. That\u2019s self care.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. Wife is out of line. When someone has a jumbled brain (anxiety) and tries to formulate their thoughts, they wont always \"sound intelligent.\" Telling someone that, especially at 15, will do massive damage to their self image and attributing \"sounding\" to \"actual.\"\n\nHave a talk with your daughter about helping her articulate what she is trying to say and tell her to take her time. Write it out if needed. As for your wife, you 3 probably need family therapy.\n\nNote: My comments come from experience.", "NTA... I am trying to wrap my head around \"just how moms talk to teens\"..... I am the mom of 3 teenagers and don't talk to any of them like that. If anything, she is making your daughters anxiety worse. What a terrible woman", "NTA\n\nStanding up for your daughter here is just good parenting.\n\n\u2018Moms talking to teens\u2019 like that is a problem, not an acceptable status quo. \n\nSounds like you\u2019re trying to nurture and help you daughter learn how to find her voice while your wife is doing the exact opposite.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t rein it in there will come a day where she has no relationship at all with your daughter", "I have a lot of things I want to say about your wife and how differently I feel as a mother about insulting children, but I don\u2019t think I can do so in a polite manner so I am just going to say NTA and you and your daughter may want to find a different living situation if this is normal behavior for your wife to insult y\u2019all instead of having any empathy.", "NTA, your wife needs is TA.", "NTA - your wife seems to be insecure about her ineffectiveness and lack of communication skills.", "NTA - And some mother's wonder why their teenage daughters distance themselves from them, and then turn around and make comments like this. You have to communicate on her level.", "Oh boy! NTA. \n\nMy mother used to insult me ALL the time, so I'm totally on your side here. By degrading her, she will just trigger more anxiety and if your daughter already as anxiety issues then comments like that will make things all the worse. Please keep fighting your daughter's corner as comments like that DO have an enormous impact. Sadly, I had no one to fight for me and I've spent my life impacted by it all.", "YTA.  Your wife didn't give any insults, she simply described the situation.  Your daughter needs to not use \"anxiety\" as an excuse. Simply \"taking a break\" from something that your having trouble with instead of trying harder is not a valuable life lesson. Unfortunately, only the mother is willing to give this type of advice.", "If I say DURING the conversation: \"Ok, let's not talk like that\" she says I am \"undermining her\" which is laughable to me, but that's what she says.", "\"Yes, I will continue to undermine your insults to our child. Don't talk to her like that. If you have a message you would like to get across without insults, I will support it.\"\n\nShe needs serious therapy if she thinks insults add anything to her parenting or give her authority in any way. Parenting doesn't come with insults built-in to the message. Parenting disputes are one thing, this isn't a debate about two different parenting techniques, like at all. \n\nWhether the insults stop or not, make sure your daughter sees you standing up for her. Make sure she knows not to accept insults from others - if she's used to her mom insulting her and dad avoiding rocking the boat, she'll let friends and boyfriends insult her too. It has the potential to be so damaging."]}
