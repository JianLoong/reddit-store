He's got his moments, of course, like all kids do, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBefore we decided to move in together, I made it clear that while I am fond of her son, I wasn't ready to take up the father role.

For a while, she seemed fine with this arrangement.\n\nHowever, recently she's been pressuring me into doing more \"dad\" things with him, like helping him with his homework, teaching him life skills, attending his school functions, etc. Her view is that if we're living together, I should be acting more like a father to him.

I feel like ESH, but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nAs someone that is sure you never wanted kids, a long-term partnership with a woman that already has kids is something that really should have been avoided as there is no compromise once the child is in the picture- however I do know that the heart wants what it wants what it wants sometimes. \n\nThe reason I think your partner is shitty is because she\u2019s forcing you into situations that you\u2019re not comfortable with, you made your feelings clear from the start and she should have split from you if she wanted a partner that wanted to be a parent, not gotten into a serious relationship and then turned the tables on you.\n\nThe reason I think you\u2019re shitty is because you chose to get into a serious relationship with a woman with a child, her child is an extension of her, sure you don\u2019t have to be a \u2018dad\u2019, but helping with homework, taking the kid places, and general interaction with the child is an absolute non-negociable. Once you got into this relationship, you signed up not to be a father, but to be involved with the child\u2019s life and existence for the sake of your partner if for no other reason. You\u2019re not shitty for not wanting to be his dad, you are for not expecting to have any involvement in the child\u2019s life.\n\nThe real victim in this scenario is the child. Undoubtably he will have his own thoughts about his mum forcing a \u2018new dad\u2019 onto him, and also about your feelings toward him.\n\nI really hope this situation can be handled in a way that\u2019s beneficial for all parties, good luck OP", "ESH.  \nYou don't align on a very important topic and instead of both of you coming to the conclusion that this will not work out and end it, you continued and now this is where you are.", "ESH.

If you break up with his mother, are you going to keep seeing him if you are allowed?\n\nThe tricky thing with blended families, even for married couples, is that it doesn't necessarily follow that all parents or children want the step-parents to think of themselves as a parent, and not all step-parents are willing to consider themselves as parents to their step-children as their.  Even supposing that you do take on more parental responsibilities, is she willing to have you act like a parent, or is she going to remind you that you aren't one whenever you disagree, especially as regards discipline. \n\nWhat sort of school functions is she talking about?  Do you want to go to PTA meetings?  If the child is in a play, do you want it to be optional whether you attend or not?  Are you going to be expected to arrange your work schedule to take the the child to various appointments or to watch ball games as a parental obligation, or can you simply help out when it's convenient?  Most of all, if you agree to help with things, are you going to find that it ratchets up to where she now regards them as your responsibilities?\n\nadded: It might be a good idea to take the advice that people are giving you, and if this breaks up, not date women with children.

You are not the asshole any more than your partner but you both will be assholes if you continue with this arrangement.

(Like this post, which I am replying to, which about the worst top-voted reply in this subreddit I have ever seen.)\n\nThe bulk of users in this subreddit seem to be teenagers. And the prevailing philosophy here is: Children can do no wrong. Adults can do no right.\n\nThe asshole in this story is your partner.\n\nFirst, she agreed to this arrangement going in: you are not the kid's father. She agreed to that. Now, all of a sudden, she decides that the arrangement, that she agreed to, is unacceptable.\n\nFair enough. She decided she made a mistake to agreeing to this. Parents make mistakes.\n\nSo, she has two options: 1) Make the best of this situation, or 2) move on from this relationship. Those are her only options. No others.\n\nBut she's decided, instead, that she's going to pressure you and call you names for sticking to the terms of your initial agreement. That she's going to harass and badger you into doing something you aren't prepared to do.\n\nTrying to change you is not her option. You can't bully someone into being a father figure, which is what she's trying to do.\n\nShe seriously called you an asshole for sticking to the terms of our agreement. \"How dare you not do something that you said you weren't going to do and I agreed that I would never make you do? You asshole! How dare you stick to the terms of our agreement?\"\n\nShe's the asshole here. She's entered into a relationship, moved into your home, all while agreeing that you do not have to be the father to her kid. Now that she's gotten her foot in the door, literally, she thinks she has the right to change your obligations.\n\nNuh-uh. She got a home for her son and financial support, which is what she was after. She doesn't get to decide to change your terms of the bargain.\n\nAnd let's be real. Even if you did decide to more \"dad things\" with the kid, your partner has lost her marbles if she thinks her son won't pick up on the fact that you're doing this because his mother made you. Not out of a desire to bond with the child.\n\nAnd there are some seriously idiotic suggestions here. \"Harrumph! Harrumph! You need to step up! Now! Or step aside!\"\n\nSimple question: why do you have to do that? Why do you have to change anything? You never agreed to be the kid's father. She agreed to enter this relationship with that understanding.\n\nShe's the one who now finds the terms unacceptable. So, if any action is taken here, it has to be hers. Again, she either needs to suck it up or leave the relationship and find someone who is willing to be a dad to her kid. Pressuring you into doing something that you made abundantly clear that you will not do is not an option.\n\nYou do not need to change who you are. You do not need change a single thing about this relationship, because you're not the one with the problem. She is.\n\nIt is not up to you to make a decision. It's up to her.\n\nETA: Although I have to say, this relationship is doomed. Even if she quietly acquiesced to the arrangement that she agreed to, she's just going to spend the rest of your time together, roiling in resentment that you won't step up and be a father. And if you decided to do more dad things with the kid, you're the one who's going to be roiling in resentment.\n\nIt's over. You had a good run. This relationship is doomed.", "It may be a relative she adopted because nobody else could take him in.
