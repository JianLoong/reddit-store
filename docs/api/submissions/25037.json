This isn't an issue about the child's behavior, he is a sweet and well-behaved boy. He's got his moments, of course, like all kids do, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBefore we decided to move in together, I made it clear that while I am fond of her son, I wasn't ready to take up the father role. I am willing to support them financially and I do enjoy spending time with the kid, but I am not his father. For a while, she seemed fine with this arrangement.\n\nHowever, recently she's been pressuring me into doing more \"dad\" things with him, like helping him with his homework, teaching him life skills, attending his school functions, etc. Her view is that if we're living together, I should be acting more like a father to him. When I reminded her of our initial agreement, she got upset and called me an asshole.\n\nShe claims that I am immature and refusing to take responsibility, whereas I just feel that I am being honest and trying to stick to what we had agreed upon. The last thing I want is to deceive the boy by giving him hope that I want to be his dad when I don't. But I also hate seeing my partner upset.

I feel like ESH, but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nAs someone that is sure you never wanted kids, a long-term partnership with a woman that already has kids is something that really should have been avoided as there is no compromise once the child is in the picture- however I do know that the heart wants what it wants what it wants sometimes. \n\nThe reason I think your partner is shitty is because she\u2019s forcing you into situations that you\u2019re not comfortable with, you made your feelings clear from the start and she should have split from you if she wanted a partner that wanted to be a parent, not gotten into a serious relationship and then turned the tables on you.\n\nThe reason I think you\u2019re shitty is because you chose to get into a serious relationship with a woman with a child, her child is an extension of her, sure you don\u2019t have to be a \u2018dad\u2019, but helping with homework, taking the kid places, and general interaction with the child is an absolute non-negociable. Once you got into this relationship, you signed up not to be a father, but to be involved with the child\u2019s life and existence for the sake of your partner if for no other reason. You\u2019re not shitty for not wanting to be his dad, you are for not expecting to have any involvement in the child\u2019s life.\n\nThe real victim in this scenario is the child. Undoubtably he will have his own thoughts about his mum forcing a \u2018new dad\u2019 onto him, and also about your feelings toward him.\n\nI really hope this situation can be handled in a way that\u2019s beneficial for all parties, good luck OP", "ESH.  \nYou don't align on a very important topic and instead of both of you coming to the conclusion that this will not work out and end it, you continued and now this is where you are.", "ESH.

And the masses always back the mother saying it's her kids and such, which is true but now when a guy says he doesn't want to parent the child he is attacked for that stance as well.  \n\nI have no verdict really in this. I guess I would go NTA because you stated your position the entire time.
