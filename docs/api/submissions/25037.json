It just wasn't in my life plan. However, I fell in love with a wonderful woman (35F) who comes along with an adopted child (7M). We've dated for about 3 years now. This isn't an issue about the child's behavior, he is a sweet and well-behaved boy. He's got his moments, of course, like all kids do, but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBefore we decided to move in together, I made it clear that while I am fond of her son, I wasn't ready to take up the father role. I am willing to support them financially and I do enjoy spending time with the kid, but I am not his father. For a while, she seemed fine with this arrangement.\n\nHowever, recently she's been pressuring me into doing more \"dad\" things with him, like helping him with his homework, teaching him life skills, attending his school functions, etc. Her view is that if we're living together, I should be acting more like a father to him. When I reminded her of our initial agreement, she got upset and called me an asshole.\n\nShe claims that I am immature and refusing to take responsibility, whereas I just feel that I am being honest and trying to stick to what we had agreed upon. The last thing I want is to deceive the boy by giving him hope that I want to be his dad when I don't. But I also hate seeing my partner upset.

If kids aren't in your life plans, you both  should've never started a relationship in the first place.

You both need to recognize that so this child, who had no choice in the matter, doesn\u2019t feel rejected by you.", "ESH.\n\nI'm sorry if this offends you or anyone else, but it's the hard truth. You shouldn't be with someone who has a kid if you don't want to be a parent or in a parental role. But she also shouldn't be with someone who doesn't want kids. You both knew what you were getting into. If being in this parental role is an issue for you, it's time to end the relationship.", "ESA. Such a difficult situation but tbh what did you expect, of course the child you live with is going to see you as a father figure? What did you and his mum expect to happen?? Like honestly what was your plan? Because it\u2019s one thing to say to the mum, but we\u2019re you going to turn around to a child and tell them you don\u2019t want to be a father figure? That would be awful. The mother should have never allowed it, but you should also realise if you go out with a woman with a child, you will always be a father figure.

And the fact that you didn't immediately back away when you realised shehad a kid when you're obviously childfree is *equally* disgusting.\n\nBreak up and spare the kid this fucking trauma.\n\nI honestly cannot imagine how absolutely beyond dumb you have to be to think this was a viable option.", "Honestly ESH.\n\nYou should have ended things when you found out she had a child.", "ESH\n\nYou're not compatible. Both of you should've realized that moving in together would change the entire dynamic and making your original agreement completely unworkable from both sides.

I feel like ESH, but not for the reasons you might think.\n\nAs someone that is sure you never wanted kids, a long-term partnership with a woman that already has kids is something that really should have been avoided as there is no compromise once the child is in the picture- however I do know that the heart wants what it wants what it wants sometimes. \n\nThe reason I think your partner is shitty is because she\u2019s forcing you into situations that you\u2019re not comfortable with, you made your feelings clear from the start and she should have split from you if she wanted a partner that wanted to be a parent, not gotten into a serious relationship and then turned the tables on you.\n\nThe reason I think you\u2019re shitty is because you chose to get into a serious relationship with a woman with a child, her child is an extension of her, sure you don\u2019t have to be a \u2018dad\u2019, but helping with homework, taking the kid places, and general interaction with the child is an absolute non-negociable. Once you got into this relationship, you signed up not to be a father, but to be involved with the child\u2019s life and existence for the sake of your partner if for no other reason. You\u2019re not shitty for not wanting to be his dad, you are for not expecting to have any involvement in the child\u2019s life.\n\nThe real victim in this scenario is the child. Undoubtably he will have his own thoughts about his mum forcing a \u2018new dad\u2019 onto him, and also about your feelings toward him.\n\nI really hope this situation can be handled in a way that\u2019s beneficial for all parties, good luck OP", "ESH.  \nYou don't align on a very important topic and instead of both of you coming to the conclusion that this will not work out and end it, you continued and now this is where you are.", "ESH.
