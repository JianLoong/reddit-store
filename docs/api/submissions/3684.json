If he was not hitting mailboxes he would still have a scholarship.  Doing dumb shit can change your life in the blink of an eye.

I hate how in midwest and the south there are some people who will care more about \"their team losing their star player\" but not on the fact they are encouraging youth to do what ever they want. And as long as they are the \"star player\" they do not have to follow rules.  Granted I understand kids will do dumb stuff from time to time. But anyone goes unchecked and continues to do ever they want can lead to worst stuff down the road. Not to mentioned it puts a bad label on athletes that do follow rules/kept in check.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, just remember that this drama from the \"community\" will only last till the next season and the people will focus on another player.  For the kid, it normal to feel bad but acknowledge he did receive consequences for his actions. Also you had every right to press charges and chose not to.  His arm will heal and they will find out if he can continue in football or if he will look for what is next for him.", "NTA. Next time, reply and say if they don't stop harassing you, you welcome legal action and will be pressing charges. I suggest making a record of the harassment and filing a police report.", "NTA.

There are absolutely no consequences, so they can do whatever they want.
