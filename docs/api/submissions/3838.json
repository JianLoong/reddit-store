If he wants you to have the same bedtimes, he can step up and take care of some of your responsibilities while you have some time \u201coff the clock\u201d. If he\u2019s not willing to do that he doesn\u2019t get to complain about you taking time elsewhere in the day.", "NTA\n\n\n\nSounds like you only have conversations about this in passing and not a sit down conversation. \n\n\nYour husband is WAY out of line to call you disrespectful while trying to give you a bed time. \n\n\nFor me things to adress would be:\n\n\n- you feel disrespected by me not doing as you tell me. What about the respect you should have for me? I'm an adult person and can organise my own day.\n\n\n- how is his sleep effected? Do you need to change when comming to bed later? Could you do it before or in a bathroom not connected to the bedroom?\n\n\n- might this be about cuddling and closeness or.. you know.. cuddling?", "NTA. But you have a big problem here with this ridiculous controlling behavior from your husband. You are an adult and are just as entitled to time to yourself as your husband.", "NTA. Many couples have different beds/rooms for all kinds of reasons. Needing alone time and working different schedules is an excellent reason to go to bed later. He can use a body pillow, and you can find other ways to show him you like him.", "NTA but if you really are waking him being up, it\u2019s fair for him to be annoyed/want the situation to change. If this is his low key attempt to increase\u2026intimacy\u2026 that doesn\u2019t inherently take precedence over your right to have some personal time. That topic should be addressed explicitly if indeed it is the issue and shouldn\u2019t be expected to supplant the no touch time you get to yourself.", "NTA- hello welcome sahm also. My husband is 6-2. While I don't need to be up till 7a.m. and school is 5 mins away. We all need our quiet time to binge watch crappy shows or  poop in peace. It's not fair to ask you to sleep when he sleeps. My husband understands that day time It's bluey on loop. When theses kids go to bed it's time for house and Bones reruns and he let's me be. We all need a wind down time. Being a sahm means these kids are always with us and on us . We deserve time to unwind and get that untouched feeling.", "NTA. You need to have a talk with your husband about boundaries, though. If you need alone time, that\u2019s your right and you should tell him calmly but assertively. He clearly has some insecurities that probably need to be discussed as well. Everybody handles life and their day to day differently, and that should be completely okay, especially when you end up in the same bed overnight anyway. I wish you luck and hope that this gets resolved!", "NTA, but I do the same thing and my fianc\u00e9 expressed similar concerns. Now we do a bedtime routine where we watch TV and cuddle and he passes out and I get back up. He just missed and valued the intimacy of falling asleep with me.", "NTA. If he wants you to go to bed and give up your alone time he can take the kid AND ALL DUTIES for a few hours before so you are ready at the same time as him.", "NTA. You're an adult, and have your own responsibilities. There's no issue here, it's normal to want to have your own me-time. It's really important to have that time to recharge.", "Nta. But he is controlling.", "NTA. Your husband is being selfish in wanting to force you to keep him sleep schedule. And his sleep quality is his own problem to manage -you are not his comfort pillow. There is nothing \"disrespectful\" about your going to sleep later, or about you needing me-time. Don't feel guilty.", "NTA at all and your husband sounds super controlling. Your need for alone time is not an affront to him. Further, time spent asleep isn\u2019t exactly quality time spent with your spouse. I don\u2019t know how to help you but I know that you are absolutely not in the wrong.", "NTA he's controlling and manipulative.  OP you have to set a boundary and that is telling your husband no and explaining to him that you're an adult and so is he and you both have the right to sleep at any time you chose. \n\nYou both have jobs yours is full time and his is 9 -5 I assume so you have way more hours of work and need your own schedule that supports you and helps you unwind and if that's alone time so be it. Being a SAHP is hard and you deserve not only a thank you from your husband but he needs to step up and help more.", "nta - IF you're being as considerate as possible sound wise and when you crawl into bed, there's nothing wrong with you two having differing schedules.", "NTA\n\nI feel like there's more to this issue than just sleep schedules. He's either trying to coerce you into more sex, or is weirdly controlling and uncaring about your needs. \n\nYou are a full grown adult and if you need quiet personal time in the evening, that has nothing to do with him, especially when he's already sleeping. Also, your schedules are different, so it doesn't make sense for you to change your schedule just to fit into his wierd idea of having identical sleep patterns because it's \"respectful\". \n\nThe whole thing is off and icky. There's a significant age difference and a financial imbalance that can lead to manipulative behavior. May I ask, has he been married before?", "NTA. You\u2019re allowed to sleep when you want to sleep and wake up when you need to wake up. Sure it would be nice to maybe once a week or at least a few times a month to go lay down with your husband at the same time but you aren\u2019t required too. I go to sleep at like 10pm or 10:30 ish and my boyfriend can be up playing video games until the early hours of the morning and sure it would be nice for him to lay down next to me when I want to sleep but he doesn\u2019t have too and i don\u2019t mind him playing his games but it would be nice if his computer wasn\u2019t in the bedroom but I know he tried to keep the volume minimal when I want to sleep and I know one day when we have our own space he can have a computer room separate from the bedroom.", "NTA, but I have a suggestion. If he\u2019s someone who can fall asleep quickly, maybe you can go lie down in bed with him for a bit until he falls sleep and then quietly get up and have your private time then. If this is feasible, it sounds like it could be a good compromise. \n\nI might be an odd one, but it\u2019s hard for me to fall asleep at night unless my husband is still awake. I get a lot of anxiety and bedtime and I feel safer falling asleep if I know he\u2019s still awake.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are not doing anything crazy or disrespectful and you're not putting anyone in danger. Toddlers are exhausting, you deserve every moment of peace you can get so you can be the mom your kid deserves the next day. He's a grown man, he can learn to fall asleep on his own. As long as you don't disturb him or wake him with your activities, I don't see why his needs would trump yours.", "NTA\n\nI've actually gotten onto my boyfriend's schedule of staying up all night and still being able to do stuff during the day. I still am able to get sleep but my boyfriend will make sure that if I'm tired, I go to bed. \n\nYour husband is being weirdly controlling about you wanting to go to bed the same time as him. I would have a conversation about why he thinks he can control your sleep schedule.", "NAH\n\nMaintaining intimacy with your spouse is important to your relationship so I understand him wanting you there with him when he goes to bed.. could he maybe take over childcare for an hour or two to give you the alone time before bedtime so you both get what you need? \n\nWe have a loose rule in our home that we go to bed together. Chat about our days, play with the cats, give the dog some treats. It's really important to have uninterrupted time together without phones, kids, computers, etc. \n\nI do understand your need for alone time also. Is there any other time of day you could squeeze that in?", "NTA\nI would like to add to all the above that whenever I see a stay at home mom say they are 'thankfull to their husband' for working fulltime, it gives me the creeps. Saying this indicates that you or he thinks that he is making the sacrifice here and allowing you to stay home. Taking care of Kids all day and doing all the mental work of being an adult and a family (financial stuff, meal planning, doctors appointments, school stuff for your kids) and on top of that doing the housework is way harder than doing a 8 hour workday and than switching off at the end of that. Him judging how much alone time you should need is totally wrong. Please talk to him and make him see this.", "NTA - DH and I are the same, he gets up 5-5.30am and I get up 7-7.30pm. It doesn\u2019t bother him that I go to bed later though unless he feels like we haven\u2019t had any time to connect or if he feels like I\u2019m trying to avoid sex and not communicate about it. Is it possible this could be the issue? The way he\u2019s trying to control you isn\u2019t ok though.", "I get it, I was a stay at home mom and a natural night owl and my husband was an early to bed and early to rise kind of guy.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that his love language is spending time together or touching (or maybe more), could you compromise and go to bed with him 1-2 nights that are planned out ahead of time (kinda like a date night).", "NTA. Is he this controlling with other aspects in your life?", "NTA \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting \u2018me time\u2019.", "NTA, my wife and I have completely different sleep schedules and we survive without arguing about it. But I have to ask, is there any reason you can\u2019t go to sleep at the same time as him and do your \u201cme time\u201d in the morning instead of at night?", "NTA, he needs to grow up", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA! I was a stay at home mom and always went to bed after my husband, still do! I need to recharge, ALONE, if not, I will go nuts! Plus, I don't have to wake up that freaking early!", "NTA", "No no no, I am a SAHM of a passel and since my first was born I have always done the late night feed before sleeping. That time is time for my brain to settle. You are most likely touched out, over stimulated, up to your eye balls in laundry and bill paying and organising and sometimes we need quiet for everything to reset. Hell, I wrote my first book in those quiet late night hours. I needed that time, I still do some days. Why is going to bed at the same time as him a big deal? You can still have fun bouncy yum time and then get up to enjoy your night routine when he passes out if that\u2019s where his insinuations are heading.", "NTA. \n\nThis is classic manipulation and controlling behaviour. \n\nStudy if he tries to control you in other ways in life. \n\nYou might find a pattern of cluster b personality behaviour revealing itself to you over time.\n\nThis behaviour is \u201chistrionic\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nI wake up at 4:00 a.m. for work. My wife works from home and doesn\u2019t have to wake up until 7:30 a.m. That is a three-and-a-half hour difference. Which means I am ready for bed way earlier than she is during the workweek. It would be completely unfair of me to demand she essentially shorten each of her days by that amount of time so we can go to bed at the same time every night. That\u2019s not to say we never go to bed at the same time - we do - but it is not expected every night and certainly never demanded.", "NTA that alone time is important \nJust throwing this out there maybe he\u2019s hinting at intimacy but unable or embarrassed to voice that , either way pretty lame on his part .", "I'm not sure. To me, you're avoiding spending down time with your husband. Do you spend any time together when it's just the two of you? If not, it does seem like you're actively avoiding being alone with him and of course that's going to make him wonder what's going on. In his turn, he's not handling things very well by telling you what you should do instead of finding out why you're doing it. ESH, him because he's laying down the law and you because I'm not sure you're being entirely fair to him.", "He is abusive.", "Yeah, I wondered about the last point. \n\nDoes husband perceive this as avoiding sex?", "Thats a mood on the bluey", "Negative  cause if I lay down I go to sleep to. Sometimes we just need us time.", "... if his solution of his wife activily avoiding intimacy is to try to be authority they have other problems... \n\n\nHe might just miss her.", "That\u2019s fair. Another commenter suggested having your husband share responsibilities around the kiddos bedtime routine so you can have some alone time while he\u2019s taking care of that, and then be ready to go to bed at the same time. If kiddo isn\u2019t waking until 7, that could be a good opportunity for some additional alone time for you in the mornings. \n\nDo you think that would be a better way to address this?", "Rabbit - these are solid points, rare to find a thoughtful response based on the nuance of two human's different and sometimes competing perceptions.", "Negative I'm not a morning person. I barely move as a zombie to get these kids to school and lay back down with the baby. My husband is a morning person while I handle the night. I'm thankful baby believes in daytime naps. Some of us have to realize we aren't sleep compatible.", "Oh sorry, maybe I misread. Your post implies you just have the one 4yo kid. Do you have other children in addition to the 4yo?\n\nWould he have sufficient time to be ready for bed if he handles the nighttime routine so you could have alone time then?\n\nI do agree him calling you selfish for wanting alone time is kind of a dick move, but testing out some of these methods might be worth a try. If it works, it works. If it doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t.", "It's not me. BUT if my spouse requires my dead body by him to sleepi it snt fair.  We take our turns with said child. If I need an hour with all kids asleep that should be around no? I go to sleep AT 1 A.M. ready for the hectic a.m. I get. I shouldn't be responsible for his sleep he's am adult. If baby calls me to lay down with her prior to my time I go. I won't go for a grown adult.", "Well, I\u2019m just trying to be helpful here. There are a lot of benefits to going to bed at the same time as your spouse (even if you aren\u2019t actually falling asleep at the same time), such as an increase in oxytocin levels, and improved REM sleep, which could, in turn, help you to feel more rested in the morning and ready to tackle the day.\n\nIf you\u2019re groggy in the mornings after sleeping from 1am to 7am, you likely aren\u2019t getting enough sleep. Especially when you say going to bed with him and getting up after he falls asleep would end up with you also falling asleep.\n\nI think it would be beneficial for you and your husband to have a conversation about why he wants you to go to bed together, and what responsibilities he\u2019s willing to take on to allow for your alone time in the evenings. Do you think this is about him being controlling, or is it about his need for intimacy?\n\nMarriage requires compromise on both sides, and I sincerely hope the two of you can find something that works.", "My marriage is about compromise.  He knows I'm not an a.m. person an I know he's an afternoon napper.  I sleep in, and he makes breakfast for the kids. I get up and take over so he can sleep through lunch. I do lunch and wake him up on the weekends for dinner. It's a compromise we work together.  My night sleep isn't dead sleep. Baby wakes up at 3 a.m. to go pee, and i still get up to clean her until she has learned to do it herself. It's a balance until they are old enoyto handle themselves.  M-f we figure it out. Weekends we alternate who gets the extra hours of sleep.", "I literally got 3 hrs of sleep last night cause my gums hurt.  He took over after work cause he knew I didn't sleep due to pain. Took a pain pill and took over so he could nap for a bit. Marriage is about compromise and some folks need to see that but we got 17 yrs of compromise for us.", "To be honest, I\u2019m not hearing a lot of evidence so far that your marriage is about compromise when it comes to this specific issue. You intend to just go along with your current routine and not consider his feelings. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but I feel like I and other commenters have offered good advice, which you\u2019re dismissing, and you don\u2019t seem willing to have a real conversation with your husband about it. \n\nHave you considered that he wants the two of you to go to bed together to foster intimacy? Speak to him about it. If that\u2019s the case, you need to find a plan to try and meet him halfway. Either by adjusting the routine so he\u2019s getting kids ready for bed if that is possible to be finished while allowing for him to go to sleep on time, and for you to have alone time while he\u2019s busy with that.\n\nIt honestly kind of sounds like he\u2019s frustrated because he misses you at night. Your marriage is the foundation of your household, and even grown adults have needs, which need to be taken into consideration by both parties. You having a need for alone time is valid, and so is his need for time to the two of you connect as a couple without kids around.\n \nIf this is indeed about intimacy on his part, and you\u2019re dismissing it without a willingness to find something else that could work, that makes you TA here.", "Well, apparently I\u2019m an idiot (maybe it\u2019s the wine), but I just realized you aren\u2019t the OP. Your first reply to my original comment threw me off and doesn\u2019t really apply to the actual OPs situation. LOL", "Fyi..we don't sleep the same time. We both get the kids to sleep at the same time. I know at 1 a.m is when he needs me. Which is why we have 5 kids we work with what we have. After 1a.m.is us time. Thankfully he has weekends off and we keep adding to our broad of children. I sleep with the baby in the room and he  takes the livingroom.  Again compromise because his alarm goes off at 5a.m. while babyband I still sleep in.. we make it work. We do jail house visit to get our fixes in. My husband understands my lack of sleep cause I wake up to every cough, fart, sneeze  these girls give us while he sleeps in. I make time for him on the weekends and he knows his girls come first weekdays. Compromise.  This man is never left tossed aside. When these girls hit 18 wile will have more time. But we balance kids and our relationship very well. That's why we're going on   17 yrs together.  It's compromise.  He's fine on the sofa and I'm fine with the babies foot in my face lol.", "It's OK.  I'm drunk too to makes my gums numbs to deal with these kid tomorrow lol"]}
