A practical stranger being invited can make it awkward for the other family members as clearly this is meant to be a family affair only.  On the flip side also what is your soon to be BIL and his partner thinking that a wedding is a great time to meet other members of the family?", "NTA. \n\nMeeting her first doesn't even seem like a big ask. If he can't do that, I'd be concerned about her coming myself.", "NTA, it\u2019s your wedding and you get to invite whoever you want.\n\nI think it makes sense and it\u2019s a nice compromise to meet the girlfriend before deciding whether or not to invite her to the ceremony", "NTA.

Oh, and the bouquet will be squarely aimed at her.", "NTA. If it was a big ceremony I would maybe say give him the plus one.

He should have asked, politely, if you would consider adding her to the list if they\u2019re still together in June, and should certainly be open to you meeting her before the wedding. There is plenty of time between now and June to arrange a dinner or an outing or something. It\u2019s hardly a big ask to actually have met all the people coming to your 15 person wedding. I would not, however, make her invitation contingent on whether you like her-ie, if he agrees to get together before the wedding so you will have met, make sure he knows she\u2019s invited before the meeting so he doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re asking to approve his date, just meet her.", "NTA - it\u2019s your wedding!

He told his brother the same as me - we don't want people we don't know at our very small wedding but we are very open to meeting her and then inviting her. \n\nI actually had to calm him down yesterday before he went off on his brother as I think he might have his heart in the right spot and just went about things poorly.
