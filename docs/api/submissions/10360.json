Do you have a written contract in place with students?  It is likely time that you set to work on a basic, how this relationship is going to work type of contract.

That would have prevented the issue of her accusations.\n\nHowever, the phrasing of this makes me think that you might also be asking \"if I'm not the asshole, should I deny her the refund?\" To which the answer is, no.

That way, if she tries to sue you in court (she might), you have the factual evidence backing up why you're dropping her as a client.\n\nIf you want to keep running your small business, you need to have clearly outlined procedures in place, precisely to avoid this kind of issue.

I did nails for 20+ years and the most valuable class I ever took was called:\n\n\u201cClients Behaving Badly\u201d\n\nBy Jaime Schrabeck, Ph.D.\n\n\u201cWhen clients behave badly, it\u2019s time to question your judgment and evaluate your contribution to the problem. The reason why clients behave badly is very simple - because you let them. You continue to schedule them even as they arrive late or miss appointments entirely, criticize your work, complain about the price, etc. What\u2019s the incentive for good behavior when you keep rewarding bad behavior? Serving your clients should make you feel good about yourself, professionally and personally. I sincerely hope that you wouldn\u2019t tolerate an unhealthy professional relationship anymore than you\u2019d tolerate an unhealthy personal relationship. You deserve better, but unless you\u2019re willing to act, you\u2019re not likely to get it. \n\nMy best advice for losing bad clients? Simultaneously change your schedule and raise your prices (even minor changes will do). If you haven\u2019t already done so, develop salon policies and procedures and be prepared to enforce consequences. Give your clients at least a month\u2019s notice that you\u2019ll be canceling all future appointments to rebuild your new schedule. Reward your best clients by giving them priority as you fill your new schedule. Do NOT schedule bad clients; when they realize that you\u2019re no longer willing to tolerate their behavior, they\u2019ll go elsewhere. Who you choose to serve, and when, is your business, literally.\u201d\n\nAs you go forward, respect yourself enough to put these boundaries in place. My entire salon did, although we were all independent, and omg, what a difference! That class was at least 15 years ago, but it changed my life. The principles apply to so much more than clients. \n\nAll the best to you.", "NTA but as you run your business, you might need a list of expectations and promises. Surely other private teachers have done samples somewhere. \n\n24 hour notice for cancellation or full fee. Drop off no earlier than 5 minutes. Pick up no later than 5 minutes or $x per minute. All fees paid 24 hours before next lesson or it is canceled. Polite behavior. Practice 3 times before next lesson. No good or drinks. \n\nAnd don\u2019t lie to anyone ever. Your ethics are your stock in trade and your basis for trust.", "NTA. Bully mom found out that you have a limit and she\u2019s not liking it. That tracks. \n\nI appreciate that you\u2019re taking the time to parse this out, OP! I was also raised to believe that anger (or causing anger) was a sin \u2014 that\u2019s a fun one to get over as an adult! \n\nIf you need a quick counter-argument when that old belief rears its ugly head: anger is just an emotion, and emotions are neither good nor bad. *And you\u2019re only responsible for your own emotions.*", "YTA for using an excuse that you didn't need to. There was no reason not to just be upfront and explain the inconvenience that she has caused and that you will no longer be teaching her son. Instead, you now look like you were lying, even though you weren't. \n\nJust refund her the money and let it go. And if you have problems with future clients, then be upfront. Maybe get the cancellation rules etc. written up and make the client sign in future (if you don't already do this). That way, there will be no further incidents.", "NTA - she's TA for not paying when she knows the cancellation policy.  I'm not clear on the math but if she shorted you for two lessons but later paid for two ahead - then you're all good on payments.\n\nI suspect this is why you wisely require payment of fees in advance.  Block her and move on.", "NTA. I\u2019ve run my own dog walking business for 12 years and had to drop a couple of customers in my time. I recently had one customer who asked me to do twice daily cat visits on a regular basis as they travel a lot for work. They turned out to be an absolute nightmare. They were texting me 30-40 times a day and then getting angry if I didn\u2019t reply immediately. They had cameras in the house and spied on me constantly but would change their mind every day eg day 1 demanded I leave the balcony door open, day 2 yelled at me for leaving the door open etc. They also underpaid me by approx 30%.\n\nI happened to have a minor family emergency so I used that as an excuse to invoke the break clause in my contract and they went absolutely insane. Started threatening to sue me, come to my house, call the police etc. In the end I put their key through their letterbox, blocked them on everything, and just wrote off the money they hadn\u2019t paid me. Some customers are not worth the stress.\n\nWhat I would advise from reading some of your comments though is it sounds like you need a slightly more robust paperwork system. You mention you don\u2019t do receipts but I would suggest finding the time. It sounds to me like you do this a bit more casually then it being a full time job?\n\nDo you have contracts for your customers? If you do make sure you put in their about late payments, your right to cancel a contract, cancellation fees etc. In my country their are laws on late payments and I can start charging customers interest but it has to be clear on my invoices, this may not be the same for you but something to consider. If you don\u2019t have contracts I\u2019d strongly recommend it.\n\nSend all of your customers an invoice each week/month and confirm when they\u2019ve paid. This will also help with your records if you need to do a tax return etc. I\u2019ve had customers contact me years after I did a job for them wanting copies of invoices so it\u2019s good to keep records. Hope you have better luck with students in the future!", "As a music teacher you should always have a contract drawn up with parents, exactly for this type of situation. Yeah, it's not the kids fault and it's sad to see a promising student suffer because of their parents, but you're also running a business and that woman has to understand that. If she violates the contract all you should have to do is reference the document that she willingly signed. \n\nEdit to add: NTA at all.", "NTA, but lying will always bite you in the ass. Be honest up front.", "NTA but you should refund her the lessons not provided just to not give her any ammunition to make you look bad.", "I think refunding the remaining 2 lessons is the right choice. She'll bad mouth you around the neighborhood regardless, but this way she has less ammunition. At this point it's about managing the relationships with the other parents.

Perhaps you can find a tutor who is a better fit or Jake can prepare on his own. I will be removing him from my roster.\"\n\nWith that, she left. I don't know if Jake's mom thought she was kidding or something, but when she didn't show up the following week, Jake's mother started blowing up Anna's phone asking where she was and when she was coming to tutor Jake. Anna let about 10 of the calls go to voicemail and then finally answered the 10th.\n\nAgain, after Jake's mother let Anna get a word in, she politely, professionally and calmly said, \"Mrs. J, we discussed this 2 weeks ago.
