Do you have a written contract in place with students?  It is likely time that you set to work on a basic, how this relationship is going to work type of contract.

That would have prevented the issue of her accusations.\n\nHowever, the phrasing of this makes me think that you might also be asking \"if I'm not the asshole, should I deny her the refund?\" To which the answer is, no.

I did nails for 20+ years and the most valuable class I ever took was called:\n\n\u201cClients Behaving Badly\u201d\n\nBy Jaime Schrabeck, Ph.D.\n\n\u201cWhen clients behave badly, it\u2019s time to question your judgment and evaluate your contribution to the problem. The reason why clients behave badly is very simple - because you let them. You continue to schedule them even as they arrive late or miss appointments entirely, criticize your work, complain about the price, etc. What\u2019s the incentive for good behavior when you keep rewarding bad behavior? Serving your clients should make you feel good about yourself, professionally and personally. I sincerely hope that you wouldn\u2019t tolerate an unhealthy professional relationship anymore than you\u2019d tolerate an unhealthy personal relationship. You deserve better, but unless you\u2019re willing to act, you\u2019re not likely to get it. \n\nMy best advice for losing bad clients? Simultaneously change your schedule and raise your prices (even minor changes will do). If you haven\u2019t already done so, develop salon policies and procedures and be prepared to enforce consequences. Give your clients at least a month\u2019s notice that you\u2019ll be canceling all future appointments to rebuild your new schedule. Reward your best clients by giving them priority as you fill your new schedule. Do NOT schedule bad clients; when they realize that you\u2019re no longer willing to tolerate their behavior, they\u2019ll go elsewhere. Who you choose to serve, and when, is your business, literally.\u201d\n\nAs you go forward, respect yourself enough to put these boundaries in place. My entire salon did, although we were all independent, and omg, what a difference! That class was at least 15 years ago, but it changed my life. The principles apply to so much more than clients. \n\nAll the best to you.", "NTA but as you run your business, you might need a list of expectations and promises. Surely other private teachers have done samples somewhere. \n\n24 hour notice for cancellation or full fee. Drop off no earlier than 5 minutes. Pick up no later than 5 minutes or $x per minute. All fees paid 24 hours before next lesson or it is canceled. Polite behavior. Practice 3 times before next lesson. No good or drinks. \n\nAnd don\u2019t lie to anyone ever. Your ethics are your stock in trade and your basis for trust.", "NTA. Bully mom found out that you have a limit and she\u2019s not liking it. That tracks. \n\nI appreciate that you\u2019re taking the time to parse this out, OP! I was also raised to believe that anger (or causing anger) was a sin \u2014 that\u2019s a fun one to get over as an adult! \n\nIf you need a quick counter-argument when that old belief rears its ugly head: anger is just an emotion, and emotions are neither good nor bad. *And you\u2019re only responsible for your own emotions.*", "YTA for using an excuse that you didn't need to. There was no reason not to just be upfront and explain the inconvenience that she has caused and that you will no longer be teaching her son. Instead, you now look like you were lying, even though you weren't. \n\nJust refund her the money and let it go. And if you have problems with future clients, then be upfront. Maybe get the cancellation rules etc. written up and make the client sign in future (if you don't already do this). That way, there will be no further incidents.", "NTA - she's TA for not paying when she knows the cancellation policy.  I'm not clear on the math but if she shorted you for two lessons but later paid for two ahead - then you're all good on payments.\n\nI suspect this is why you wisely require payment of fees in advance.  Block her and move on.", "NTA. I\u2019ve run my own dog walking business for 12 years and had to drop a couple of customers in my time. I recently had one customer who asked me to do twice daily cat visits on a regular basis as they travel a lot for work. They turned out to be an absolute nightmare. They were texting me 30-40 times a day and then getting angry if I didn\u2019t reply immediately. They had cameras in the house and spied on me constantly but would change their mind every day eg day 1 demanded I leave the balcony door open, day 2 yelled at me for leaving the door open etc. They also underpaid me by approx 30%.\n\nI happened to have a minor family emergency so I used that as an excuse to invoke the break clause in my contract and they went absolutely insane. Started threatening to sue me, come to my house, call the police etc. In the end I put their key through their letterbox, blocked them on everything, and just wrote off the money they hadn\u2019t paid me. Some customers are not worth the stress.\n\nWhat I would advise from reading some of your comments though is it sounds like you need a slightly more robust paperwork system. You mention you don\u2019t do receipts but I would suggest finding the time. It sounds to me like you do this a bit more casually then it being a full time job?\n\nDo you have contracts for your customers? If you do make sure you put in their about late payments, your right to cancel a contract, cancellation fees etc. In my country their are laws on late payments and I can start charging customers interest but it has to be clear on my invoices, this may not be the same for you but something to consider. If you don\u2019t have contracts I\u2019d strongly recommend it.\n\nSend all of your customers an invoice each week/month and confirm when they\u2019ve paid. This will also help with your records if you need to do a tax return etc. I\u2019ve had customers contact me years after I did a job for them wanting copies of invoices so it\u2019s good to keep records. Hope you have better luck with students in the future!", "As a music teacher you should always have a contract drawn up with parents, exactly for this type of situation. Yeah, it's not the kids fault and it's sad to see a promising student suffer because of their parents, but you're also running a business and that woman has to understand that. If she violates the contract all you should have to do is reference the document that she willingly signed. \n\nEdit to add: NTA at all.", "NTA, but lying will always bite you in the ass. Be honest up front.", "NTA but you should refund her the lessons not provided just to not give her any ammunition to make you look bad.", "I think refunding the remaining 2 lessons is the right choice.

But either way, I think you\u2019re right that it would be better to have things in writing.", "I think you\u2019re totally right! I had contracts for a while, but it felt unnecessary since every one was a friend or friend of friend and we\u2019re very kind. It\u2019s also been a more casual thing for a while. (Not making enough for tax returns or being a sol proprietor) Obviously I was wrong to assume it was okay to slack off on that.", "Totally agree. But I did try being honest about her disregarding my policies for several months. She was so confrontational that I tried to avoid bringing up more confrontation by being honest about the things I had already discussed with her. :/", "Totally agree :)", "I think you\u2019re totally right. Didn\u2019t think about how she would get ammunition from that. Sheesh. I\u2019ve communicated with the other parents about this issue (never mentioning my clients name) and letting them know that if there\u2019s any issue they\u2019d like to bring up with me they\u2019re welcome to :)", "If you're going to deal with customers, you need to have a backbone. Reading your post you're kind of the AH to yourself. Stop putting up with people like this woman. You did nothing wrong. She needs to pay you the agreed upon amount, and if she left her kid there longer than she was supposed to, I'd charge a babysitting fee of $150 an hour. \n\nBut since you dropped her, implement this fee if it happens with other clients. And make a contract with that stipulation. Do you have a contract you have your clients sign when start lessons? Because if not, you should.", "You can download and print standard receipts if that helps", "There are multiple sites/apps for small businesses to invoice & collect payment, some do more bookkeeping stuff.", "Use the postal service.", "I teach private art lessons and unless you are seriously in need of the money, I would just refund and cut ties before other things happens to save yourself from more headaches.", "If you are in the USA, do as Creepy_Addict said, on paper instead of electronically. Send the refund by check or money order, and mail it to your former client. You should send it certified with a return receipt. That way you will have proof from the US Postal Service that it was delivered and accepted by the recipient. This will protect you legally if your former client tries to cause problems for you.\n\nAs a retired CPA, this is how I dealt with the tax authorities and difficult tax clients.", "You said you won't keep her child as a student. How is that not firing her, or if you prefer some other term, ending the relationship? \n\nAt that point she knows you lied to her. You said you one thing about a new job and when called out on it changed to the accurate story. So I can't blame her for wanting to be done at that time and call the whole thing off.", "IANAL (I Am Not A Lawyer).  But I know document everything.  Keep any text exchanges between you and the client.  The client may not sue.  If she does, it will likely be in small claims court.  \n\nThe last thing you want is to have it be \"I said, she said\"\n\nYou **did** make a **big** misstep lying to claim \"We're closing the business.\"  Remember, as the sole proprietor, any statement you make represents the entire business.   \n\nPut simply, to run a small business, you **need** to be able to handle confrontation in a constructive way.  Trying to avoid it altogether **will** backfire.  As you've seen here.\n\nI would advise starting therapy to work on your ability to handle confrontation in a constructive, healthy manner.", "Definitely do that. Written agreements hold more water and I find that if you're working with friends, it's even more important. \nFriends always seem to be the ones who screw you over, of this sub is anything to go by.", "A good recommendation I had that I'll be switching to is to call your fees tuition instead of payments. It's a bit of a psychological thing, but tuition makes it seem more like an investment that parents like that one might take more seriously. Just a way to help make doing something you love not turn into something you dread because of situations like this. I do hope that student ends up getting the education he deserves despite his parent!", "Understandable. I wouldn't either.", "I think you\u2019re totally right. And thanks for the \u201ctough love\u201d. :) I think confrontation is definitely something I need to work on in therapy. \n\nI LOVE the babysitting fee idea. Because at that point, that\u2019s what it is. I used to have a contract but I got too relaxed with it because all my clients were friends or friends of friends who were really kind. So I stated my policies to her, which would be in my contract, but never had her actually sign anything. Definitely will be doing that in the future though!", "Oh definitely! Thank you!", "I had no idea! I\u2019ll look into that, thank you", "I think you\u2019re totally right! I definitely just want her out of my hair at this point.", "That is great advice! Thank you!", "I guess that could be seen as firing. In my mind that seems like a more aggressive term? But I just let her know that we have two more weeks of lessons and because of natural new changes (like a job) I would have to discontinue them. \n\nSo the strange thing is, is that most people would just accept it when I told them I have to cancel lessons. But she went and asked other client *before* replying to my initial text - which seems paranoid and judgmental from my perspective. Her first assumption was that I didn\u2019t like her kid and she looked for validation in that. And when she didn\u2019t back off I told her the real reasons so she would leave me alone.", "Thank you for the advice! I have all the messages saved, just in case. :) \n\nI think I was a little unclear in my post, but I told her I had to drop a *few* clients, not everyone or that I was closing my business. It\u2019s not like a super official business either, I\u2019ve just been teaching on the side since I was a teen. Not sure if that changes anything? \n\nBut I definitely do need therapy for that!! If only it wasn\u2019t so expensive haha.", "This is a business. Again, run it however you want, that's your call. \n\nBut she's not an asshole for wanting to talk to another client before responding to your text. She felt something was off, and well, she was right. There isn't any reason to take this personally. People talk about piano teachers. That's word of mouth. Don't get bogged down in emotions. Have firm policies in place and enforce them clearly. But yeah, know if you cut a student the parents will be upset and they will talk. That's just life. \n\nWhen she called months ago to sort of cancel how did you respond? That's the big question on if she owes you money.", "Here are some excellent books that may help until you can afford therapy:\n\n\"The Four Agreements\" - Excellent, brief self-help book written by a Native American\n\n\"The Power of Now\" - Spiritual self-help book about being present\n\n\"The Untethered Soul\" - Spiritual self-help book with a sense of humor\n\nAlso, look up \"EFT\" (Emotional Freedom Technique) since it may help you with anxiety.\n\nThe key to remember is to find the tools that work and **use them consistently**.", "Uh, and it is the client\u2019s responsibility to follow the policy.", "That\u2019s true. I guess I didn\u2019t see it from that perspective. I was just a little floored she would jump to accusations. \n\nShe wanted to cancel when I messaged her about discontinuing lessons. It wasn\u2019t months ago :) But when she told me that, she blocked me immediately after and didn\u2019t give me a chance to respond.", "Thank you for the suggestions! That\u2019s super kind of you. I\u2019ll look into those :)", "Do what do you think she owed you money for? The 2 weeks that she opted not to continue after you cut him as a student? Or the two weeks from months ago when she called to say she maybe wouldn't make it?", "NTA. You should have a signed contract that no shows are still billed and failure to pay results in no more lessons. Refund her less the missed lessons if you aren't giving him the lessons.", "Its not your job to teach difficult people how to not be difficult. \n\nI've been working in an appointment based field for 15 years. Difficult people will always try to \"negotiate\" with you and often turn to accusations when they aren't getting what they want. \n\nYou're within your rights to fire a client for any reason. And you dont always have to warn or explain to them the reasons. You can give everyone the benefit of the doubt if you want and give them a conversation as to why but at the end of the day, some people change and some don't. Its ok to choose to no longer work with someone who pushes your boundaries and disrespects your policies.  That's just good business.  NTA", "NTA. I have been giving music lessons for years. I have dropped several students over the years for things exactly like this. \n\nHowever I probably would have just been honest about why, and give them a chance to fix it up. I have written lesson policies that work well to reference in situations just like this one. but seriously you are so NTA.", "NTA", "NTA.  But honesty is the best policy, you did open yourself up for scrutiny when there were some half truths in your story.", "NTA. This was a valuable lesson in what some people are like. Don't feel guilty. I'd advise a written set of your policies on payments handed out to all parents.", "NTA.  I would also recommend you switch to Zelle instead of Venmo so clients can't reverse their transactions.  And have a written policy about when payments are due, how cancellations work, and that clients will be dropped after 2 missed/late payments. If extraordinary circumstances occur they can contact you before payment is due to work out an alternative plan.", "NTA. You owe her no apologies, explanations or refunds. I had a similar situation: a client who was appreciative of my services but who was never on time -- 15-20 minutes late. NO apology. Then she booked and began skipping appointments. When I had had enough, I told my booker not to book that particular client any more. If a client disrespects your time -- and time is money -- then it's a client you do not need. And they know it.", "You need a strong \"if you do not show up, you still pay\" policy and stick to it. If they refuse to pay once, the lessons are over.

Sometimes it\u2019s absolutely sane and rational to find something egregious. \n\nThis woman\u2019s behaviour was not ok, and you had every right to call her out on it. But you need to learn to do it firmly, and CLEARLY, with no hemming and hawing.", "NTA, but I have to say; anger isn't morally wrong. Certain kinds of expression of anger are morally wrong. I felt I had to say something because repressing any emotion can be damaging. Just need to be responsible about how you process it.", "NTA but anger isn\u2019t wrong. It\u2019s actually a healthy emotion to express at the appropriate times.", "Nta, she\u2019s not good for your mental health. You have no obligation to teach her child if it means putting up with her.", "NTA. I\u2019d refund her.  Just move her out of your life.  You can warn other music teachers about her if you want.

Anger isn't necessary to cut off a bad client, nor does it need to accompany a confrontation. In fact I'd argue that if you can stay cool in a confrontation, you're far more likely to come out ahead.", "It\u2019s better to be direct and immediate. Don\u2019t pay a bill for a missed lesson? You have to pay before you can book another. And pay upfront rather than after. If she\u2019s late, put a late pickup fee in place and charge her that. But you should be firm and not allow the next lesson until the fee is paid or she will assume that these things are up for debate.", "NTA, and I agree with the commenter above. Musician here. I would give new students and their parents a list of studio policies and consequences for not adhering to them. You can make it sound less punitive by including things that you will do if you have to cancel on short notice (but be realistic about this). This is your job, not a fun hobby that you do for your love of children/music (even if you do love children/music).

First, all lessons should be paid ahead of time. Second, if she owes a late pickup fee (and personally I would just charge whatever the cost is for your lessons - so like $50 an hour or whatever that is, with a 5 minute grace period), then just don\u2019t allow the next lesson until that\u2019s paid. It\u2019s simple.", "I don\u2019t disagree, the problem is verbiage/communication. To some saying \u201cI might not be able to make it\u201d is an informal way of canceling. If I client uses that language more than once, that may be how the communicate. Instead of having the conversation about it, op just sent them venmo requests for back pay, which is not clear communication."]}
