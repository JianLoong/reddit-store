This is my first Reddit post so hopefully I\u2019m not breaking any rules I don\u2019t know about :) \n\nMaybe this seems like an obvious question, but I was raised to believe anger is morally wrong (I don\u2019t believe that anymore) but am still struggling with the feeling. \n\nHere\u2019s the spiel.\n\nI recently had a client (I teach piano) who I\u2019ve been working with for the past several months. Her son has been learning fast and is a good kid. But she refused to pick him up on time, even after I brought the issue up. She also refused to pay two of my Venmo requests (how I get paid by clients) even though I have a 24hr cancellation policy. (She said he \u201cmight\u201d not be able to make it 24 hrs in advance but I was still planning on him) She canceled that Venmo request and sent me one with out those two lessons in it. \n\nAfter several months of this behaviour among many others that would take too long to mention I told her I got a new job and that I\u2019m cutting out students. I phrased it as professionally as I could. \n\nShe responded with saying she\u2019s been in contact with my other clients in the neighbourhood and stated that I\u2019m not dropping them. She accused me of not liking her son and \u201ctargeting\u201d him. \n\nThat\u2019s when I told her about all the issues I\u2019ve been having with her and that it has NOTHING to do with her kid. I told her she was rude for accusing me of targeting her kid.  \n\nShe denied it, we bantered for a few more texts and then she blocked me. Now she\u2019s requesting a refund for the next two weeks of lessons she paid for.\n\nI tried to end lessons with her with out brining all these frustrating things up. Is there a balance between being a pushover and standing up for myself?? Was I in the wrong? \n\nThanks for reading, this was a long one! :P\n\nEDIT: \nI should clarify that I did get a new job (wasn\u2019t lying about that), but it\u2019s flexible enough that I didn\u2019t really NEED to drop her as a client. I tried to end it that way so I didn\u2019t bring up things I\u2019ve already tried discussing with her, but maybe that would have been better!

Still, I don't think you should have made up this silly excuse that you were closing up your business. Can't you see how that could have caused confusion in your other students?

If these lessons are cancelled, as you are the one who has dropped her as a client, I think it is fair that you refund her the next two weeks' money.

Do you have a written contract in place with students?  It is likely time that you set to work on a basic, how this relationship is going to work type of contract.  Outline payments and consequences of what happens if payments are not made and exactly what your cancelation fee policy is, and how late pick ups will be handled. Then you have to stick to it.  (the first few times will be hard).\n\nI think maybe in your effort to soften the blow you created an opportunity for this parent to try to manipulate you.  Business is business.  (Husband and I own our own business so I get it).  Also if I can add in to my already long response, you are not being a pushover you are running a business.  Period.\n\nI would return the payments, move on from this and take it as an opportunity to learn and make your business grow.  Sounds like you have a lot of other clients, that value your time and efforts.  Good luck.", "NTA but the better way to sever ties would have been an email about the non-payment issue with a, \" this arrangement does not work for me, I wish you luck in finding a teacher who is a better fit\" message.", "Not the asshole for dropping her, but as others have said, there was no need to lie, just stand your ground and tell her the truth. That would have prevented the issue of her accusations.\n\nHowever, the phrasing of this makes me think that you might also be asking \"if I'm not the asshole, should I deny her the refund?\" To which the answer is, no. You still give her the refund because she isn't getting those 2 weeks of lessons she paid for, and if you spent the money already then you may need to figure out a plan as to when to pay her back.", "NTA.\n\nThis is on the mother for not respecting your time/paying you.", "NTA but it might just be easiest to refund the two lessons than to continue to go around with this woman over the prior cancels she never paid.", "YTA. You should have told her the reason why she was being dropped was that not paying bills and picking up her son late. It sounds like she paid in advance for the last two lessons? You should also refund those if you are dropping her as a client.\n\nIt sounds like this client deserves to be dropped. However, 1) telling he the real reason and 2) refunding past $ is what you should have done.\n\nYou may say that \u201cshe owes me money from before\u201d but if she gave you the $ for future lessons, you should treat it as $ for future lessons.", "NTA-  you did everything right by the way I see it.", "NTA\n\nI wouldn't expect to get any money from her, but I would block her.  Document everything.  That way, if she tries to sue you in court (she might), you have the factual evidence backing up why you're dropping her as a client.\n\nIf you want to keep running your small business, you need to have clearly outlined procedures in place, precisely to avoid this kind of issue.  And **NEVER** lie to avoid confrontation.  As you saw, this backfires.  \n\nBluntly put, you **can't** rely on customers being polite and respectful or to honor unwritten rules.  You were relying on an unwritten \"rule\" that kids would be picked up when the lesson was over.\n\nMake the policy clear, in black and white, with clearly outlined procedures.  This protects you **and** the clients, by ensuring clarity of communication.", "I think I would have given her a heads up and said if xyz doesn't change then I'll need to cut him as a student. \n\nBut regardless NTA for dropping client.", "Thank you, this was very validating!", "I guess I could have given her a warning - but that felt rude. (Which in hind sight isn\u2019t - it\u2019s a part of business). \n\nI did get a new job but it wasn\u2019t necessary that I drop her. I wanted to let her down easy and avoid confrontation. Obviously that backfired lol. \n\nAnd I have given thought of how to run my small business, and it\u2019s worked for many years. But now I obviously do need to make some changes.", "My mental health definitely has taken a bit of a toll with these interactions, so I appreciate the affirmation :)", "Thanks! I did get a new job but it wasn\u2019t necessary I dropped her. I was trying to let her down easy by using that as an excuse. In hindsight maybe wasn\u2019t the best approach.

Not sure I was expecting her to come around after months of her not taking responsibility and getting annoyed even if I was being a push over.", "I think you\u2019re right. And I totally would do this but she\u2019s blocked me on everything haha. I also would deduct what she owes but then we would be even. And she definitely would disagree with the amount.", "Probably would have been better :) I did get a new job though. It wasn\u2019t necessary I drop her but I think I was looking for a way out.

At one point I did have a written contract but I got lazy and stopped using it because all my clients were so amazing. But I guess it\u2019s time to bring it back. I\u2019ll definitely use some of the suggestions you gave :)", "I think you\u2019re right, but unfortunately I don\u2019t have her email.

I\u2019ll do this if a case like this ever comes up again!", "I did get a real job but it wasn\u2019t necessary that I drop her :) it did feel a little fruitless to try and explain why I was dropping her son because I\u2019ve tried addressing it for months and she never took responsibility. \n\nI was ready to keep teaching for those last to lessons, but she lashed out and demanded a refund and that lessons be stopped :/  But I will still give her a refund bc I want her out of my life", "I think I will refund her, but I can\u2019t discuss anything with her bc she blocked me on everything.", "Every time she didn\u2019t follow one of my policies I tried to gently remind her but she never took responsibility :/ So because I had already tried discussing my reasons with her I felt it would be too forward to bring it all up out of the blue.

I did state the rules through text in the beginning when we decided on lessons, and I reminded of her of them through out the last couple of months.

OP continued to keep her as a client and she knew the client was disputing that she owed for those times. After all this time I don't think she owes for the no shows. \n\nIt's on OP to say when she called and said she 'might not make it' more than 24 hours in advance of the lesson to be clear she needs the lesson cancelled now or she will be charged.", "The client said she \u201cmight\u201d not make it. She did not cancel. Not the same thing.", "It\u2019s op\u2019s responsibility to make it clear about that issue."]}
