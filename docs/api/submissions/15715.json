You aren't an asshole,  and the person sounds very rude. However, self-care for localized burn really shouldn't require someone's aid.

If you are an off duty or responder or a lay person who knows CPR at all and you provide it to the best of your reasonable ability while making an effort to summon help there is legal protection. Please check your state law for details.
