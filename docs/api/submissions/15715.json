Being sued for an exacerbated injury is quite another", "NTA designated first responders do not get to pick and chose when their assistance is required.

Good on you OP and sorry about the injury.", "NTA\n\nYou weren\u2019t being malicious just honest. You did everything right. \n\n It sounds like your coworker gets something extra from the company in exchange for them giving first aid and their refusal violated an agreement.

I'm having a bad day.\"\n\nThey got called out on their own actions and they're blaming you.  Not cool", "NTA, is this person actually a friend?", "NTA. \n\nThey are required to administer FA as it is likely in their job description.

It is an extremely disrespectful response in such a situation.   \n\n\nAnnoying that you are now at home because of another accident. If you really feel that when you go back to work shits going to hit the fan or they won't talk to you. Perhaps you could raise this with the company physician or a confidential advisor?

Sounds like FA is part of his formal job function, and he should have provided aid.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhat about the other people there. Did they say anything? I can't imagine somebody to get burned and nobody to try to help. If I was there, I would rip the first aider a new one.

Just having a first aid cert may or may not impart a duty of care, and your work may or may not have rules about being required to render aid, but no, you're never the asshole for accurately reporting a workplace injury.\n\nThat said, what sort of 'first aid' were you expecting for some coffee spilled on your hand?  I'm certified in first aid and CPR, and 'first aid' for that kind of burn is:\n\n1) run it under cold water for ten minutes, which you did.\n\n2) it's either fine at that point, maybe some ointment and a non-adhesive bandage, or it turns out to be a terrible burn that didn't look terrible at first, in which case you call 911 or your country's equivalent.", "AFAIK we don't get paid extra to be a first aider, but thank you, I hope I get better soon, I hate not going to work lol", "Hasn't felt like they have been a friend for a long time.

First aider that witnessed it a tually had to fill out an accident form and they didn't, so that went against the company's rules or whatever.", "You still aren't the AH for getting hurt and needing their assistance - they agreed to the responsibility, so they can't decide there are times they can't be arsed to fulfil it...", "NTA.  \nIf work pays for first aid training, then you are required (at least where I am) to act as a first aider while at the workplace. If your co-worker was the registered first aider on shift, they don't get to say no because they are having a bad day.\n\nOP if they got into trouble, it was their actions, not yours which caused the trouble.

Leave those so called friends.", "NTA - he shouldn\u2019t have volunteered to be a first aider if he can\u2019t handle the pressure and it\u2019s only right that he gives up his hi-viz jacket and the sign above his chair to somehow who\u2019s willing to step up", "NTA.

Was it just red or were there any blisters? Also are first aiders provided with some more specialist equipment or is that only very basic first aid kit?", "Came here to say this.... The first aid for a burn is to run it under cold water for 20 minutes and take an over the counter pain reliever if needed. If it's worse than that you call 911. Did you expect this first aider to hold your hand under the water for you? I don't get it.

Thankfully the other first aider did a great job.", "It wasn't that bad, a few small blisters and died knuckles from the coffee for a few days after.", "First aid can be instructing people in what to do, like saying to run it under cold water. Also, making sure it's under the water for long enough - a lot of people would take the hand put of the water for a couple of minutes once it's cooled a little bit, so staying with them for them minutes to make sure it's cooled properly would also be first aiding", "I'm a nurse so to me \"basic first aid\" means having taken a CPR class and very rudimentary first aid. You aren't an asshole,  and the person sounds very rude. However, self-care for localized burn really shouldn't require someone's aid. A burn that would require calling paramedics isn't going to be helped by someone doing basic first aid. So, long as the person actually volunteered for this position, they are the asshole.", "That's good. Let's hope you don't need help for anything more serious when they are around.", "True. I'm honestly not looking forward to going back incase theirs drama and the group doesn't talk to me. Not got many friends in that place", "If they start drama, refuse to talk to you, etc, go to your manager and/or HR and file a report for hostile work environment.\n\n\nAlso, if they're going to retaliate and cause drama for something that's not your fault, they're clearly not your friends to begin with. You should find better quality people to hang out with."]}
