It is the kind thing to do, to warn someone with fertility issues privately before you announce your pregnancy in a group setting.", "YTA, full stop.   You should have had a private lunch with her and let her know and given her the option of not attending the party.  Springing it on her was cruel.

But this is between you and the sibling.  \n\nSend an email to anyone infertile to announce the pregnancy so they can have their feelings in private.  \n\nYou don't surprise infertile people with a gender reveal.  That's common sense.", "YTA with a caveat, I get your frustration, my SIL and Bro struggled with infertility for years, meanwhile I never thought I\u2019d have children and had a surprise baby with my Ex. They were great about babysitting and I even offered to be a surrogate if it came to that. But it was a sticky wicket tempering excitement while being aware of their feelings. YTA because you didn\u2019t give her notice but I do think that this might be an opportunity- the no young kids at family events rule is weird and overbearing. You should have given her more notice and the family needs to stop tiptoeing around this issue", "YTA for not giving her a heads up so she could make the choice to not come.\nIn laws also are TA for banning everyone from celebrating their pregnancies, and hiding children under 5, Wtf. \nSister in law absolutely should have been given the option to avoid a painful situation.

You were cruel in how you went about things. She needs to learn to cope in a world that contains children.", "YTA. You knew that this was a sensitive topic and you ambushed her.

It would be common decency to give her a heads up.", "Yta. You literally put a gender reveal party ahead of any possible relationship you have or could have with your in laws.

Any decent human being would have let her know in advance of your stupid little party.", "YTA for not telling her so that she had the option not to attend. You assumed she would want to be there and she didn't want to be there. Or you could have simply not invited her. I agree that not having announcements and not allowing children is extreme but that is not the issue here. The issue is that you threw a surprise party that come off as cruel and insensitive.", "YTA - as someone who is infertile, we ask everyone to give us pregnancy announcements over text. The infertile community considers it common curtsey that their friends and family should do.

I didn't talk to her about my pregnancy but she worked through her pain and she has been around my son with no hard or ill feelings. \nBut the way you went by this knowing she has not worked through her issues is absolutely appalling.\nYou should have gave her heads up at least but she also needs to start working on her issues and the family needs to quit coddling her and allow kids no matter age around come.", "ESH.  Her and the family for demanding the world stops for her grief.   You for deciding on an ambush.  The kind thing would have been to tell her separately and not force her to be there for it.

But the way my in laws handle it in my opinion is pathetic you can\u2019t have pregnancy announcements. No children under 5 can attend family events. Despite her rules\n recently me and dan both agreed it was time to announce the pregnancy. We both agreed that we would do a surprise gender reveal. We had the doctor give us an envelope on what the gender was last appointment.\n\nWe hosted a gathering where we would announce it. And also had the party for the gender reveal when sil arrived her and her husband. When she found out she was angry and asked me why I didn\u2019t give her a heads up. And I know how she feels about this.\n\nI told her I don\u2019t have to tell her anything and that she didn\u2019t have to be such a bitch about it. She stormed out and has been ghosting me and I am blocked on all of her socials.\n\nSo am I an asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why not warn her?\n\nYou just seem super inconsiderate. The kind of person to complain about trigger warnings and shit.", "YTA.  I don\u2019t agree with the lengths they\u2019ve gone to, but giving her a heads up in advance is just the decent thing to do.  Would it have killed your to show a minimal amount of compassion?", "YTA knowing her situation you should've given her a heads up, it's not hard to be considerate of other people's feelings. You calling her a bitch is out of line, I seriously doubt your heart hurts for her.", "YTA.  Sorry.  You should have given her a heads up to give her some time to process and not surprise her.  Also, you should not call your SIL a bitch.  It was fine for you to make an announcement but the way you did it was unkind.  If you disagree with the in-laws protections around your SIL, fine, but you don't have to create drama and hard feelings.  \n\n\nCall her and apologize. Maybe send flowers.  You don't treat family badly.  She is your future child's aunt.", "YTA.  \n\n\nA surprise gender reveal at a party for that purpose where you invited your SIL who you know to be sensitive about this issue? Cruel.", "INFO: Why would you invite an infertile woman who\u2019s particularly sensitive about the fact to a surprise gender reveal party?", "NTA \u2026 if she didn\u2019t have legs would she then bitch at people walking around her?

Until then it could have gone ESH", "Everyone is an asshole. Don't spring a pregnancy announcement in person on someone who has gone through infertility.

And yet you still chose to invite her to an event and surprise her with a face full of trauma.\n\nYoure a huge asshole, you pretty much invited a PTSD stricken veteran into a room and threw a firecracker in just for funsies.\n\nWhy did you even want her there for the reveal?!", "A rule about not allowing family members at family gatherings because they happen to be little kids is wildly unreasonable, but you know this is clearly a big deal for them so surprising them with a babycentric event is really tactless.

Good luck to your baby.", "ESH: \n\nYour husband's family are AH's for making these rules for everyone instead of seeking grief and infertility resources.

That was just unecessarily cruel.", "ESH The fact that SIL can\u2019t be around children is not good. She won\u2019t be able to completely avoid kids all the time.

Did you think she\u2019d just automatically be able to be happy for you? You could\u2019ve given her time to adjust and be able to at least fake a smile if not the real thing.

You aren\u2019t beholden to rules about not announcing your pregnancy, but you didn\u2019t have to invite her or spring it on her.\n\nHer family also sucks. A certain percentage of the infertility community needs a very serious reality check about reproduction. It is not a need, it is a desire, and this is the type of behavior that a clinician would say is interfering with day-to-day life and the ability to maintain healthy relationships. \n\nHere\u2019s where I get downvoted to shit: I\u2019m inclined to forgive you as much as I forgive her. Feeling like you aren\u2019t allowed to have your own life because someone else can\u2019t breed must be brutal. Feeling like you aren\u2019t allowed to celebrate a wanted pregnancy must be devastating. And future children are absolutely going to know that Auntie Whatever has an issue with their mere existence.\n\nI get that you guys probably just snapped and said \u201cTime for the pendulum to swing our way for once.\u201d It\u2019s a tempting impulse, it really is.

If anything she should be excited for you considering your own past with pregnancies. And not to have children under 5 at gatherings???

It might have been generous to give her a heads up but I understand why you didn't. The bigger problem is her family's way of dealing with her unfortunate situation. To expect everyone in the family to refrain from making pregnancy announcements is ridiculous. Banning children under 5 is one of the most absurd things I have ever heard. Does this mean you will never celebrate a holiday or birthday as a family for the next 5+ years? \nI don't know how she functions in the real world if her family has treated her that.

Sorry but thats just strangest thing I read today haha. You both acted like AH honestly, suprise party is too much.", "ESH.", "ESH\n\nYou ambushed an infertile woman, who clearly needs therapy, makes you AH. The In Laws and the SIL are the AH because what kind of psychotic people punish children by not being allowed at gatherings of any kind simply because they were born?

Probably, but that\u2019s on them you don\u2019t get to control their actions.", "ESH\n\nThe way in-laws are handling this is not healthy. Do they honestly expect to just exclude children under 5 forever. They also can\u2019t expect others to not celebrate their own joys because of one person. \n\nThat being said, that doesn\u2019t mean you subject that person to situations that you know will hurt them. You should have at least told them what the event was about since you knew how she would react. It sounds like you just wanted to rub her face in it. \n\nThen to add to it you called her a bitch. Grow up.", "ESH.\n\nI think i don't have to elaborate further", "ESH- you didn\u2019t have to call her a bitch, and you could have told them privately over the phone before the party. It seems like you wanted a reaction tbh. Your family has been coddling her too much though and it seems like it\u2019s made her pretty tough to be around. You can\u2019t hide pregnancy and babies from her forever.. infertility sucks but that doesn\u2019t mean the world stops for everyone else.", "NTA. Yea it\u2019s sad she\u2019s infertile if she wants kids. But she can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t expect the world to stop for her. The whole family is crazy for enabling her.", "YTA.\n\nThe way the family had been dealing with this is wrong, but inviting people for a gender reveal party without telling them it is a gender reveal party also seems strange as shit and not the best way to deal with things.\n\n(There a hundred and one reasons why someone might not want to go to a gender reveal party and by not telling them what it is you remove their freedom to go or not. This is also not ok).", "ESH. You for not telling her, her for her weird rules and expectations. But you're worse. Try and be better and nicer for your baby.", "ESH. I'll just be grateful my family is nothing like this on either side. You're SIL is being unrealistic,  but you were being intentionally cruel. You suck on a higher level.", "Good lord.

Your sister sounds like she wants everyone to cater to her in any way possible, your family enables her way too much, and you should have just not invited her to that gathering in the first place. \n\nI do understand where you\u2019re coming from though, as those rules being made for your sister affect everyone and I probably would have called her a bitch long before this event.

Saying, \u201cI don\u2019t need to tailor my life to what you want\u201d, seems like a stronger way to put her in her place. \n\nOnce you call her a b*tch, you\u2019ve probably lost the higher ground with the family.

No more hiding kids. Insanity.", "NTA\n\nI would have said it would be best not to invite her but pregnancy announcement would not be the end. From now on you would have to hide your child and not be allowed to celebrate it. Somebody should finally bring your SIL to the reality and let her know that the world doesn't revolve around her. If she is so distressed by babies she should not go to the family events herself instead of having others adjust to her", "NTA.

If my kid isn't welcome at a family birthday party, I would stay at home with them.", "I\u2019m definitely going ESH. As the way everyone is handling it is ridiculous. You can\u2019t just pretend pregnancy and children don\u2019t exist just because one person can\u2019t have children. But the surprise party to blindside her was a petty move. \n\nI do have a question though, if you had informed her before hand, do you think she would have told everyone to make you guys out to be the bad guys?

I would keep my distance from them.", "ESH. \n\nYou knew springing this on her would hurt Jess and her partner yet you did it anyway. You took away her choice of whether or not to attend and were cruel. And to top it off you called her names. Of course you\u2019re an AH. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t give you a free pass. Also no one sensible cares about the gender except the couple, and even then only sometimes- I think gender reveal parties are usually incredibly tacky, though I concede having one doesn\u2019t automatically make you an AH. \n\nThe family are handling Jess\u2019s fertility problems poorly.

They're definitely only enabling her more.\n\nOn the other side though, clearly being aware and knowing her issues and knowing yourself how bad that hurts. I am shocked that you chose to take away her choice to come or not. You effectively forced her to be at your announcement and gender reveal by doing a surprise party and not giving her a heads up, when you knew she wouldn't want to come to that.

If you didn't invite her, she probably would have found out about your party from family and everyone would be mad at you for not inviting her. Your ILs have created a situating where no one can do anything that families do around children - pregnancy announcements, gender reveals, even just having children around at family events.\n\nETA: NTA, although calling her a B was over the top.

You\u2019ve experienced losses before so I\u2019m sure you can empathize how hard it would be for her to learn the news in the way you planned.

People have kids.  What she's going through can't dictate what other people can and can't do. \n\nBut YTA here too.

You need to look a bit closer to home, and possibly gain some empathy before your child comes. \n\nAlso before you say that I've no idea what it's like, I DO.

So YTA is to far, its a ESH.", "That\u2019s where the saying, \u201cdon\u2019t throw the baby out with the bath water\u201d came from. It was crazy to think that the filthiest person, the father, got to bathe first. And the infant, if they had one, which was probably the cleanest of all, not to mention most susceptible to illness, bathed last. No wonder infant mortality was so high.", "They could just ask her to say she is busy", "Is it possible they reused bath water back then? We reused bath water growing up, which in hindsight was unnecessarily gross because we didn't even pay for water.", "Just after college, I lived in a neighborhood that was primarily orthodox Jewish families. There was a mikvah (ritual milk bath for post menstruation) located in the neighborhood. This was in early 2000s but it\u2019s still practiced today.", "On top of the whole lack of germ theory thing, could you imagine the screaming infant thrust into dirty, cold water??\n\nThough to be fair, putting them in first might have been an issue too, with perhaps the water being too hot.\n\nI understand a lot of things, I just lose it when it comes to putting the baby in cold water. Like, surely the evidence is there in front of them. You know that water sucks.\n\nObviously there's a whole lot of missing context and available information etc etc. Still breaks my brain though", "That\u2019s something a reasonable person would agree to do. \n\nSomeone that forces everyone else to pretend kids under 5 don\u2019t exist doesn\u2019t seem like a reasonable person to me.", "Lol Mikvehs are just water, not milk. They're also used for many different purposes other than post-Niddah rituals. There's a whole hostnof reasons someone (man or woman) might go, and there's also one for dishes and small kitchen appliances. Pretty sure men are required to go a lot more often than women are tbh.", "Why did you even invite her to the party? If you knew she was going to be upset you could have just not included her...", "Info:\nI just wanna know one thing, why was your Sil invited?", "Just because there are a LOT of children who need homes, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy to adopt any of them. It\u2019s prohibitively expensive for many people.", "Given what OP did my guess is that OP exaggerated a bit to make herself look slightly less of an AH", "Even if she (OP) thought that was the case then she could\u2019ve at least texted the brother. The brother could\u2019ve taken her (SIL) out to do something else that day, then he could\u2019ve told her in the privacy of her own home. She could\u2019ve cried and got all of her emotions out with him and not of been forced to try to hold it together in front of the whole family. As a person that struggles with infertility myself this is what I would\u2019ve wanted to be done.", "Actually, it\u2019s only been the last 15/20 years thats we could talk so openly about child birth and women issues \u2018down there\u2019 sex and the city had a lot to do with it! \ud83d\ude42", "I was at a wedding in the late 1980's where the MOH was pregnant, in her 8th or 9th month. I was using the restroom when a group of elder women came in and they were all worked up about the pregnant MOH, just couldn't believe she would be in a wedding in her condition, just walking down the aisle like that, not showing any embarrassment. Shocking!!", "Exactly. OP didn\u2019t get pregnant to spite SIL she\u2019s pregnant because it\u2019s a normal event for a woman to go through. NTA, OP has shared in SIL\u2019s heartbreak, SIL needs to share OP\u2019s joy.", "That was what I got too. Like, I definitely think the In-Law\u2019s suck in general for banning announcements and kids under 5, but this felt super targeted. Like, I would 100% tell my future in-laws \u201chey, we\u2019re expecting, and while I understand why FSIL is hurting, I\u2019m not going to hide or e ashamed of my pregnancy. I will invite people to events around this pregnancy and those who don\u2019t wish to attend, I understand.\u201d\n\nThe ambush, and that\u2019s what it was, felt very targeted and intentional.", "She\u2019s damaged if she\u2019s projected that pain onto others in the form of aggressions towards OPs joyous moment. She is allowed to feel that pain, but it\u2019s not ok to take someone else joy because you can\u2019t have it. That\u2019s damaged behavior.", "Exactly.\n\nIt\u2019s a short, quick conversation to say \u201chey we\u2019re doing this, and we don\u2019t expect this person to attend, and we get it, but this is joyous for us.\u201d\n\nThe fact they both invited someone they knew was struggling, THEN WAITED FOR HER TO ARRIVE before announcing it, is mind blowing.\n\nI could see not inviting her. \n\nI could see giving her an option.\n\nI could see announcing it before she arrived.\n\nI could see announcing it after she left.\n\nI agree The way they handled it seemed like the most targeted way possible.", "As a male who is going through this too, it's hard. I don't know what else to say other than it's hard.", "Your mom was on her third child by the time she was 20?? My god. I love my kids, but I can\u2019t imagine anything worse.", "My friend and I found a medical text from the 1930s when we were kids. The advice to women on their period was not bathe or exercise. This was in the 1990s. I never forgot it because I couldn\u2019t believe people, supposed medical professionals, would believe and tell their patients something so stupid.", ">her mom and grandmother were full of shit.\n\nEvery month, for 3-7 days apparently...", "\u201cwith child\u201d", "Considering the rule and considering her reaction I would say one or the other would have happened. People need to quit acting like life doesn't go on. I think that whole family has a few screws loose. No one has the right to dictate or set up rules for everybody else considering she did this in her home.", "I am so sorry for your experience, and I am happy that there were people in your life who were conscientious to what you were feeling and kept you in mind for certain events. I can only imagine how stressful and painful this must have been. Consideration and respect for what people are going through are wonderful, and I am glad people so keep that in mind. However, I\u2019ve seen too many of these types of things play out like what OP described that I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if someone put a ban like this.", "If OP didn\u2019t invite SIL then they would\u2019ve had a fight about her not being invited. If SIL knew she would\u2019ve told other people regardless. The only good solution I saw was tell SILs husband so he can help SIL avoid the party without telling SIL until they were at home and she could handle it on her own. \n\nI\u2019m making no comment saying OP isn\u2019t TAH cause she is, but so is SIL for thinking she can ban children and make them wonder why daddy\u2019s side of the family hates them for no reason. \n\nWhy is it okay for SIL to ban children from events? How does that not make her TAH? How is emotionally damaging children because **your inability to get therapy** okay?", "\"Pads are in the linen closet, make sure your laundry gets brought down right away, have they told you about this at school yet? Well I'm sure they will soon.\" \n\n1992.", "She didn\u2019t ambush anyone. You seem to have your own personal convictions about these kinds of announcements happening at all; your comments are not objective enough for what this situation requires.", "A woman being considered unclean when she is \u201cbleeding\u201d does come from the biblical. But one of the reasons she was separated was because they were smart enough to know that blood could be dangerous(although not why) and so water sources had to be protected. You didn\u2019t exactly have water treatment plants back then. And when the rules were put in place the people were nomads. They didn\u2019t exactly \u201cbath\u201d regularly. \n\nIf you study history, it was not unusual for cultures back then to isolate women who were bleeding. It wasn\u2019t misogyny it was self preservation. Disease was a huge threat. And while they didn\u2019t understand why, they had figured out that various body excretions could be a threat.", "A surprise party that you KNOW 100% is going to hurt someone and you don't tell them?\n\nThat's an ambush", "It is. Either that or the brother is a horrible human for going along with this. Much worse than OP."]}
