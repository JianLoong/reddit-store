I was also angry and upset at the time because he almost immediately rekindled a relationship with his ex, and I had a bit of a fu attitude about everything.

You messaged her and she didn't respond.  The ball remains in her court.\n\nYou might feel bad because you took on some emotional caretaking for a person, and you might feel some responsibility for abandoning her, or making her feel as if you didn't care.  This might be tied to why you did it in the first place rather than letting your ex take the lead on managing the relationship with his own parent.  But you did message her. And she did not respond.  \n\nSo why is it that you want to \"smooth things over with her\"?  Even if you don't want to throw your ex under the bus, is there a part of you that wants her to know the facts and vindicate your actions?  Or something else?  \n\nIf she called tomorrow and said she would love to reconnect, but insisted on never talking about your ex or that relationship or the breakup (etc.), would you be relieved, or feel unsatisfied, like that would be missing the point?  Or something else?  Is there another reason why you want to reconnect?", "NTA - you did reach out when you left and she didn't reply.  \n\n\nYWNBTA for telling her why.", "NTA. You had your reasons for not reaching out.", "Lord...just good Lord....  \n\nSo you faked a good relationship for his mom's benefit.  Then y'all break up but it sounds like you still lived together for a year?  Did you not talk to his mom at any point in that year?  You ghost her?  Keep planning things with her?  Then you move out and your ex still doesn't say anything to her.   \n\nWhy do you need to smooth things over with her?  You want her to know it's not her, it's him?   Because you want her to be on your side of things?  I just don't understand.   You moved on, so move on.   \n\nESH except the MIL", "NTA and honestly just block her and move on with YOUR life.  \n\nHe has already spun the narrative in his favor and nothing you will say will really matter long run.   Unless you really cared about this woman and were great friend then my view is to just not say anything.  Guilt sux but you shouldnt feel guilty for getting out of the relationship and not talking to her.  Its been two years, so again it really isnt going to make matters any better", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Me an my ex are on really good terms now and I\u2019m going to visit him soon, so I guess I felt like I should reach out to her and clear the air. It feels weird having a relationship with him and not her. \n\nYou\u2019ve made me realise though, that I also probably do want to feel vindicated, which makes me think I\u2019m better off leaving it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t reply to my messages, and it would be an AH move for me to force a meeting with her just to \u2018clear my name\u2019. Thank you, you\u2019re questions have given me better clarity.", "Thank you. I didn\u2019t reach out to her to make plans for the holidays, which I would normally do. And I think that must have upset her because she didn\u2019t message me either. Then when I messaged her several month later she didn\u2019t reply. I can see why I may be TA for that. \n\nThank you for your questions they gave me clarity. I care about her and I guess I also don\u2019t want her to see me as a bad person. I feel bad that things ended so awkwardly between us with no explanation. But you\u2019re right, I probably do want to tell her my side of the story and that\u2019s an AH move. I should just leave it be and not drag it all up to try and make myself feel better or control the narrative.", "^this. Good job. She didn\u2019t reply, it\u2019s old news now. There\u2019s no point bringing it up, and if SHE does then her son can deal with it."]}
